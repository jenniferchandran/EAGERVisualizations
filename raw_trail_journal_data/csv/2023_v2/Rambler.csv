Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659523,Test Post #1I am planning to use this journal site to keep family and friends posted on my Appalachian Trail thru-hike progress.  Hoping to start 2/17/2023 plus or minus a day or two.   ,,View Entry,"Dec 07, Wed",0
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659540,"This page will be for the 95% of people (basically all of my family and friends) who read this journal, and are not familiar with some of the basics of the AT, and thru-hiking.  I’m going to try this as a FAQ-style write-up:

What is the AT?  
It’s a 2194-mile footpath that runs from Georgia to Maine.  It was knitted together in the 1930’s from existing and newly constructed trails running along the Appalachian spine of the eastern USA.  Some tidbits:

It passes through 14 states
Supposedly requires 5 million steps to walk….my stride is a little longer than some, so maybe it’s only a mere 4.9M! You gain (and lose) enough elevation to summit Everest 16 times during the hike.

What is a thru-hike?  Hiking the entire trail in one 12-month period.  Various people impose various “rules” on what they consider a thru-hike…things like:  not skipping a single meter of trail and not having any support from friends whatsoever.  Whatever.  It’s a trail, and I’m planning to hike it.   Like 85% of thru-hikers, I am starting at the southern terminus, Springer Mountain in Georgia, and hiking northbound to the northern terminus, Mt. Katahdin in Maine. 
Are you going by yourself?  Yes, and No.  I will be setting off by myself, however on
any given day, I will encounter and potentially hike alongside other folks undertaking
the same pursuit. 
Where do you sleep? 
Generally, in a
tent that I carry with me.  There are “shelters”
interspersed fairly regularly along the trail (every 8 to 15 miles or so).  These shelters are typically three-sided
structures with a roof that can fit 6-18 people in them.  Usually arrayed around the shelter are level
spots for people to pitch tents as well.  I plan to mostly stay at the shelter sites, as
there is typically a reliable water source there, and other folks to converse
with.  

There is also an
ecosystem of hiker hostels and other commercial lodging at various points along
the way.  Every so often, I plan to partake
of these options for an evening of a soft bed, a shower, and recharged phone. 
What do you eat?
Whatever is light,
calorie-dense, shelf-stable, fits in my pack, and is available at the various
small stores in the towns near the AT.  Think
ramen, rice, cured meats, energy bars, trail mix, nuts, etc.  I carry a backpacking stove and fuel to heat
water to rehydrate food when I camp at night. I will typically be burning
through 4000-5000 calories per day, and I need to eat a similar amount of food
to keep my energy at a functional level. 
Thru-hikers tend to gorge themselves “in-town” when making a resupply
stop, and I’m sure I will do the same.  
How long does it take? When are you starting & finishing?
Most people require
between 5 to 7 months of walking.  I know
that my starting date is going to be Feb 18, and I know that I am going to be
off-trail for a few days in early May to attend a graduation.  Other than that, I’m pretty flexible on the
timing.  I’ll move fast and far when I
feel strong; I’ll move slow when I don’t. 
I’m guessing that I’ll be done in mid-August…but we shall see!
 Are you worried about bears, snakes, wolves, serial killers, zombies,
rabid raccoons and things that go bump in the night? No. 
Are you bringing an assortment of weapons and training in combat
skills to thwart the above assortment of hobgoblins?  No.
Are you worried about injury, hypothermia, ticks, and water-borne parasites? Yes.
 

What are you doing about it?

Injury: Training myself as best I can before I start…strengthening legs, knees, ankles, core.  Being smart, especially in the early days on the trail, about not pushing too hard to the point where I get sloppy and heighten the risk of injury.  Hypothermia:  The AT is famously wet.  I will be rained on or snowed on for at least 20% of the hours I hike during the trip. Guaranteed.   I am starting the trip in February, and even in Georgia and NC, it can be quite cold in the mountains at that time of year.  Having the proper layering system for clothing, and ensuring that I am carrying dry clothes to change into at night is crucial.  Since you can’t carry a wardrobe full of clothes, you put your wet clothes back on each morning (you warm up quickly while your internal engine is pushing you through the woods), and save the dry stuff for resting in camp at night.  During the first few weeks on the trail, when it is the coldest, I also plan to be smart about potentially bailing off the trail for a day or so if needed to avoid a particularly nasty dump of snow if it happens to materialize.  Ticks:  check myself every day and pluck ‘em off before they can deliver their payload of Lyme disease (it takes a day or more of attachment before the nasty stuff transmits to the human body). Water-borne parasites:  Filter your water.  I, like most hikers, carry a small water filter. 


Are
you carrying a phone?  Yes,
although coverage will be limited during much of the hike.  It’s OK….people successfully completed this
hike for 50+ years before the advent of mobile phones.  They are certainly nice to have, and enable a
hiker to stay connected to the modern world throughout the hike if so desired….but
it’s not the end of the world if I can’t check the score of the Sox game for a
couple days.     
Why
do you want to do this hike? 
That’s
the harder one to answer.  I have enjoyed
hiking since I was a young…I hiked with my Dad in the mountains as early as 4
years old. I hiked with outing clubs in my middle school and high school years.  I got away from it a bit during my twenties
and thirties as other pursuits occupied my time and interests.  In my forties and early fifties, I hiked with
my son, mostly peak-bagging in NH’s White Mountains.  Off and on, I have hiked with friends who
enjoy a day hike here or there, or occasionally I would take solo hikes if I
wanted to bite off a bit more mileage for a couple/few days.  
I have known
of the existence of the AT for many years…I spent most of my life living in New
England, and I have hiked on bits and pieces of the trail throughout that time.  I’m not exactly sure when I became aware of
the concept of thru-hiking, but for at least the last ten years or so, I have
been pretty certain that I wanted to give it a shot when the universe aligned
properly for me to be able to attempt it. 
I wanted the opportunity to challenge myself physically and mentally.  I wanted to experience a long period of
uninterrupted focus on a single purpose. 
I wanted to see the hidden parts of this country that are right in our figurative
back yards, but overlooked due to our focus on our daily lives.  I’m not a religious guy, but there is a
certain spiritualty that comes from standing on a peak, and overlooking a
terrain that has been shaped by millennia of forces and contemplating our place
in that landscape.  

I am
happy to answer any questions about the AT, my hiking plans or whatever.  I plan to post to this journal (hopefully)
quite frequently.  Based on cell service
availability, a few days of postings may pile up before they actually get
published on the site.  For those that
know me, I’m definitely not a social media guy, so this journal will probably be
the extent of my “sharing” of the trip. 
Possibly I’ll put a few things up on Instagram…but we shall see.",,View Entry,"Dec 08, Thu",0
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659660,"I have
been hiking off and on for over forty years....I have a shelf full of
""stuff"" used for various forms of hiking/camping...day hikes;
overnight car camping hikes; multi-night backpacking; going solo; hiking with
my son; hiking with buddies; hiking with my Dad (more on his influence in a
later post)....and on and on.  You would think that I have all the gear
needed to do something simple like walk, sleep, and eat for a few days in the
woods (okay, maybe 150-ish days isn't exactly everyone's definition of a
""few"", but let's not quibble).  
Guess
what...REI and Eastern Mountain Sports now have a new favorite customer because
it feels like I have been plugging holes in my gear lineup nonstop for the past
couple months.  Some of the big hitters:
New
Tent: 
Okay, technically this wasn't bought due to my impending thru-hike.  A couple years ago, I gave my two-person REI Half-Dome
tent to my son to use in his Mountaineering Club in college (and was very happy
to do so….I’m super-psyched that he enjoys this pursuit).  I filled my shelter needs by acquiring a
single-person REI Flash Air 1…big mistake. 
I used this for a couple seasons; it was just way too small for me (I’m
6’2” and 200+ lbs), and more importantly it was a single-wall design with
terrible ventilation, meaning that significant condensation formed inside the
tent and rained back down on me all night…yuck…and Brrrrrr.    So, I now have an REI Quarter Dome SL2…and
I love it!  I’m back to having some
space, and I’m free from condensate rain. 
It’s probably a couple ounces heavier than the best of the best out
there in the tent universe….but I’ll leave those high-end purchases to the
hard-core gram weenies.  
Wow…that
was a lot of text for a few pieces of sown nylon….let’s move on, shall we?! 
Backpack: Yep…arguably the
most critical piece of gear (and probably the most expensive), I replaced. For
10+ years I have used an REI Ridgeline 65l pack and have loved it.  Rugged, reliable, reasonable weight, great
hip belt.  Why change?  
Without
getting too gross, when I hike….I sweat….a lot. 
I wanted a suspension system that incorporated the more modern ventilated
mesh back supports to at least give me a fighting chance of staying dryer.  I went with the Osprey Atmos 65….it seems to
have the right mix of what I liked with my current setup while incorporating a
mesh suspension.  I’ve done about a
half-dozen 10-milers with ~35 pounds loaded, and so far, I’m liking it.  
Footwear:  I’m a generally a boot guy when I hike.  Yep, that dates me (I’m mid—fifties), since
all the kids these days are thru-hiking in trail runners instead of the big
clunkers.     I like trail runners for when I’m doing an
easy walk through the woods with my dog and no backpack, but historically whenever
the backpack goes on, and the trail is going to point upwards, a pair of Merrill
Moab WP boots come along for the ride.  
That
said, I’m not such an old dog that I can’t learn new tricks, and I’m coming
around to the Trail Runner mind-set.  I’m
using a pair of Altra Lone Peaks (the wide toe box works well for my wide feet)
in my recent training hikes, and they will be joining me somewhere in Virginia,
once I’m reasonably confident that I’m past most of the threat of snow in the
early weeks of the hike.  
I also
decided to switch over to non-WP boots, with the hope that they will dry a bit
faster than WP boots after hours of slogging through wet February slush…it’s
probably a pipe dream…but a guy can hope, right? 
Gear
Ethos:
 Sure, I like my gear and I pay attention
to what I’m bringing, but let’s be honest, if Grandma Gatewood (google her)
could hike this thing at age 67 carrying an over-the-shoulder denim bag, a
shower curtain as a shelter, and a pair of Keds on her feet…..I’m probably
going to be just fine with my selection of stuff churned out by America’s
recreational-industrial complex.  
Okay,
that’s enough for one post….more to come.",,View Entry,"Dec 31, Sat",0
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659832,"So, what do you do to train for a thru-hike?  It’s not like it’s a race….although I have read that there is a unique cadre of folks pushing the limit to achieve the “fastest known time” for the AT.  Something like 45 days to hike 2200 miles from Georgia to Maine.    Yeah, that ain’t gonna happen. 
It’s not an activity where you need to take your heart rate to the absolute limit, and sprint to a finish line.  You don’t need to perform herculean muscular tasks like pushing around an offensive lineman in football.  You don’t need otherworldly hand-eye coordination like a baseball player.  You basically need to get out of bed, pull on a pair of shoes, strap your stuff onto your back, and walk. Up hills, across flats, and down hills.  And then do it again.  And again.  Rinse and repeat for about five million steps, across 100 to 200 days, depending on your speed.  
 

My approach to getting ready for the trail has been:

Continuing my typical summer road biking as deep into the early winter as temperatures would allow.  I did about 1300 miles this past season, and I’m hoping that helped lay in a pretty good base of aerobic fitness and leg strength.  Get out in the White Mountains as often as possible.  I was able to finish off the 4000-footer peak bagging this past fall with half a dozen hikes.  There is nothing like hiking up the famously rough and steep sections of the AT like the Wildcat range to shock your system back into hiking shape.   I wish I could have done this more, but my schedule didn’t always allow the 6 hour round-trip from my house to the heart of the White Mountains.  Do lots of trail hiking on trail networks that are much closer to my house.  I have weekly been doing three to five hikes of 8 to 12 miles each for the last three months or so.  The trails have a modest amount of elevation change (nothing like the Whites, or the AT in general, but at least it’s something), and I typically accumulate about 1500 feet of elevation gain during each hike. I have also been carrying a loaded pack (about 35 pounds or so), during these hikes.  I feel like these hikes are probably the most important part of the training.  For my upcoming time on the trail, I am mostly concerned about repetitive-use injuries like plantar fasciitis and various forms of tendonitis, and so I am trying to ensure my body gets a good dose of repetitive activity in advance of the REALLY repetitive activity.  Mix in a small amount of weight training and core training, mainly just to keep things balanced out.  I also try to work in stretching whenever possible…especially if I happen to be couch-potatoing in front of a Patriots game.  I have mixed in a small amount of running as well.  Usually this time of year, I would be running a bit more, because I can’t bike during winter in New England, but with all the trail hike training, I haven’t wanted to put additional repetition onto my lower body, so the runs have been short and infrequent.  Lots of downhill skiing in the past month or so.  I’m not sure if this actually provides any potential benefit for hiking…..but blasting down the slopes of Killington, Sugarloaf and Sunday River sure is fun!   

Anyway…hopefully this cocktail of activity at least has me reasonably ready to launch myself into the Appalachians in five weeks! ",,View Entry,"Jan 12, Thu",0

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660028,"I have been a
bit delayed in getting additional posts with other “business” demanding my
time.  Over the past few weeks, we have
sold the house in MA, packed up our belongings, and moved to North
Carolina.  There have been just a couple
of details that require attention during that process.  Ugghhh. 
I don’t miss the days when we moved 10 times in ten years.  The past 11 years have been in one spot, but
now we are headed back to the Triangle area, and we are very excited to get
settled back into a fantastic town that we know and love.  
At least I had
enough time during the last few weeks in MA to continue getting out for (semi)
regular hikes in our local trail network. 
The Pisgah conservation area in central Mass, which is jointly managed
by the towns of Northborough and Berlin along with a number of volunteer groups,
is a fantastic resource for the local citizens, and my family and I have been
fortunate to have a lot of great memories (and hikes) there.  
I was really
happy to have my golden retriever out there with me for a number of hikes in
the past few weeks.  I would love to be
able to take her along for the AT adventure, but she is now a bit too old to
handle the day-to-day rigors (aren’t we all!), and the logistics of bringing
along a pet are more than I want to take on. 
She will have to stay behind and keep Mrs. Rambler company during my
time on trail.",,View Entry,"Jan 17, Tue",0
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660029,"well, in the last week, all of our personal belongings have been loaded on truck by movers back in MA, and they are now traveling somewhere on the eastern seaboard.  The few odds and ends that we wanted to handle ourselves were loaded into our vehicles and into a cargo trailer which I towed 400 miles through the beautiful rural wilderness of NYC, NJ, Baltimore and DC before I got to my destination at Lake Gaston.   I’m hoping that my jaunt along the AT has slightly fewer folks packed alongside me than is typically the case on I95. 
we enjoyed a nice few days hanging out at the lake.  Off-season is a very peaceful time to be there….no jet skis buzzing…just the occasional flock of geese honking their way along the water. After so many years of leaving our pup with family in New England during our summer sojourn to Gaston, it was pretty cool to have her there with us.  She still doesn’t seem particularly excited to plunge into the water (it has never been her thing, which is odd for a retriever) but maybe it will be a different scenario this summer when it’s 100 degrees and the whole family is floating in the water.  
The focus of my training definitely pivoted the past couple weeks. Instead of slinging a 35 pound pack on my back and stomping around the woods, I have been hoisting 35 pound cardboard boxes (and bed frames, and lawn equipment, and, and , and….).  The barking in my lower back after all that tells me that there is a reason backpacks are on your back, instead of being carried in your arms. Who knew?
Looking forward to having our stuff delivered in a few days, and getting the whole move “process” over with.  Once it’s done, I’ll be only about three weeks away from the start of my journey….so the days in a soft bed are getting numbered!",,View Entry,"Jan 22, Sun",0
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660030,"after a long SOBO journey our stuff has arrived at our new place in NC that we are calling home.  The Moving Madness workouts continued, with loads of cartons and furniture moved up two flights of stairs to be scattered throughout the house.  I’m gonna give the folks at CrossFit a call and see if there is some kind of workout franchising opportunity.  
we are fortunate to reside near the fantastic Umstead state park, which has 5000 acres of forest and trail networks right in the middle of the bustling Triangle region.  I made use of this park a lot when we last lived in this area, and I have jumped right back in there again.  
I got out on the Umstead trails with the pup on a gorgeous 60 degree January day under Carolina blue skies and had time to get in an 8 miler.  Just as I was nearing the finish, a young woman noticed my fully loaded backpack (it’s kinda out of place amongst the weekend folks out for a stroll) and asked if I was preparing for a longer hike of some sort.  Turns out she just finished a flip flop AT hike in November!  We had a great chat about all things AT.   
Hey Slice…it was great meeting you, and I hope the new job in RTP works out great!
looking forward to some more time in the local trails this week before hitting the slopes for one last time before the AT.",,View Entry,"Jan 29, Sun",0
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660031,"The days until my start date are relentlessly (albeit too slowly) ticking down.  With much of the house unpacking process in the rear-view mirror, I have been able to get out over the last several days and sample the variety of trails that are available in both Umstead park as well as the section of NC's Mountains to Sea trail that passes through our area.  I got out in Umstead for a four mile trail run with my buddy Brandon on Sunday...it was a very good reminder that hiking fitness is very different than running fitness.  I have been doing much more of the former, and much less of the latter during the last three months, and I was sucking wind several times during the run.  Still, my stride felt strong, and I felt fine the next morning, so I'll worry about getting back in running shape sometime well after my AT adventure is over.  After a wimpy showing on a short run like that, I felt compelled to get out there for a backpack-loaded 14-miler in Umstead on Monday, just to reassure myself that I have a reasonably good baseline for the start of the trip.  It was a lot quieter on a Monday than during the two weekend days (shocker), and I even saw a heron (or was it a crane?  I'm not a bird guy and don't really know the difference) chillin' in one of the many streams that flows throughout the park.  
After three straight days in Umstead, I wanted to check out something different, so I scooted up to Falls Lake in the Rolling View area, and hiked an 8-mile out-and-back stretch of the MST.  It was very picturesque along the lake, even though it was a bit of a gloomy and misty morning.  It's always interesting to me how there are a number of old properties that abut the trail corridor with everything ranging from horse farms to modest mobile homes, to country mansions.  My stomping through the mud 5 feet from the electric fence didn't seem to interrupt the horses feeding on the bales of hay that were laid out for them.  I'm guessing that, unlike me lately, those horses weren't obsessing whether their hay bales had good caloric density and nutritional balance, or whether their water had been filtered free of all the critters that live therin.  I also saw no evidence that they needed to hang the hay in a bear-resistant bag 10 feet from the ground at night.  Good for them!",,View Entry,"Jan 31, Tue",0
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660036,"I went out this morning into the rainy mid-30s weather for a 9 miler along the MST. I figured that it was a good representation of the weather I will likely encounter during the first few weeks of my hike, and I wanted to ensure that the layers I had planned for those types of conditions are still working out for me.   I was wearing a pair of EMS Pinnacle hiking pants which have a water repellent finish, a running T-shirt, an insulating long sleeve quarter zip shirt, and my Marmot Precip rain jacket.   It rained pretty steadily during the three hours of my hike, and I was reasonably satisfied with the results.  I was definitely sweating (I pretty much always do) so it’s a bit difficult to assess how much wetness was Rambler-generated vs Mother Nature- generated.  I don’t think the jacket wetted out, but during the heavier periods of rain the thighs of the pants were soaking through.  I really don’t want to bring a pair of dedicated rain pants in addition to or instead of the hiking pants since I don't think they will perform appreciably better than the hiking pants. We will see if I want to alter my approach after a couple weeks on trail. 
I came to the realization that on a rainy day, walking through the NC Piedmont’s wet red clay which is covered with leaves and pine needles is kind of like walking across chocolate pudding skin.  Every so often your footstep causes the skin to slide across  the pudding surface and it takes all your balancing skills to ensure you don’t go flopping down into a puddle of mud (or is it pudding?). Either way, I don’t think this type of pudding would make it into George Constanta’s favorites list (google it, if you dont know) 
I was also happy to see that Scouts are still doing their thing, and there was a really well-constructed walkway for about 100 feet or so over a particularly boggy area that has been built as a recent Eagle Scout project. It actually turns out that the Eagle Scout is a friend of a friend….thank you Margaret Cash and all your fellow Eagle Scout candidates who take on projects every year to improve access and enjoyment of many areas such as this!  sixteen days to go….and counting……",,View Entry,"Feb 02, Thu",0
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660121,"The last major hurdle before hitting the AT has been cleared....I survived four days on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada without injuring myself!  Fantastic conditions (30 feet of snow so far this year, including a foot that dropped the day I arrived!), and great friends along for the ride made for an absolutely unforgettable week.  The scenery in the Tahoe basin is spectacular, and the fact that we had bluebird conditions for three of the four days just enhanced the experience that much more.  Hopefully the burning quads that I had end of each day was a good sign that I was at least getting some sort of workout from my skiing....goodness knows that I was not getting out for any trail runs or hikes during my time out there.  
Starting less than a week from now, any mountainous elevation gain is going to require the use of my own internal engine...not a big diesel engine doing the work while I sit comfortably on a chair! 
After following up four consecutive days of skiing with numerous hours of being stuffed into tight airplane seats, my legs were pretty stiff when I got back home, so ""workouts"" have consisted only of short (3 miles) dog walks with no backpack in the past two days.  I also have a million things that need attention over the next five days before I leave for the trail, so I'm not sure how much my legs are going to get a chance to get out and get moving.  I suppose that since one of the annoying tasks requires going to the Department of Motor Vehicles (twice), I will probably have the opportunity to stand in line for five hours or so....I'm not sure if that counts for a leg workout or not.

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660166,"I’m sure that
by the time this hike is over, I will have dozens of people to thank for
(hopefully) allowing me to achieve a complete thru-hike of the AT.  But before I even get started, I want to be
sure to shout out one huge THANK YOU. 
My wife of 30+
years has been incredibly supportive of this upcoming hike.   Let’s face it, a thru-hike is an incredibly
selfish undertaking.  For a five to six
month period, I will be effectively abandoning my family and friends for an
extended walk through the woods.  That
leaves a significant burden on her to attend to all the innumerable day-to-day
activities that happen in life.  We have
two kids who are still in college, and while they are largely self-sufficient,
there is still the occasional life challenge that arises, and it must be
handled.  On top of that, we have
injected some pretty significant changes in our life situation in the past
several weeks by picking up and moving from New England back to North
Carolina.  A cross-country move brings
along its own set of obstacles, and the never-ending set of tasks related to insurance,
vehicles, taxes, and so on.  
Throughout all
of my wondering aloud about whether I should undertake this hike, she has been
nothing but encouraging.  Hiking is
definitely not her thing, but she does not begrudge me this opportunity to chase
this dream, and even humors me when I am wandering around the house and wondering
aloud about the merits of polyester vs down insulation in a sleeping bag, or discussing
some other similarly inane trail-centric topic. 

Kristin, I will
miss you on the trail, and whether you know it or not, you will be alongside me
during the hike.  I will be very much
looking forward to getting back home to our wonderful life together later this
summer.",,View Entry,"Feb 12, Sun",0
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660164,"And so, now comes the time that is apparently
mandated in the AT Thru-Hiker Commandments: The “what’s in my bag for the next
six months"" photo shoot.  
 
The photo shows all of my gear and clothing that
will be in my bag and/or worn on my person throughout the hike.  
Not shown is my food, since depending upon the
day, I might be carrying 6 days of food, or almost no food.  Also not shown is my phone, since it was in my hand taking the photo.  
My non-hiking friends and family who look at the
photo may be surprised by how little stuff there is. 
Pack weight is a big deal when you are carrying it
2200 miles, so you must make a lot of tough choices.  
Things that might seem incredibly ""necessary"" in our normal lives, become very much an unneeded piece of ""stuff"" when you are on the trail.  For example, you generally end up wearing the same dirty clothes day in and day out.  As you might imagine, long distance hikers are a pretty smelly bunch…. many of them proudly call themselves “Hiker Trash”.  It's just not feasible to carry a lovely downy-fresh set of new clothes for every day and situation.  

 The experienced hikers who look at the photo might
actually think that there are a few too many items going in the bag. 
There is an “ultralight “ ethos that has become
popular in long distance hiking over the past couple decades…in short, the
trade off between putting an extra pound on your back and the comfort /
convenience that might be provided by that pound of stuff almost always falls
on the side of “leave it out” for the ultralight community.  
I’m definitely not a full-on ultralight guy…yet.   
There are certainly one or two extras in my pack that are being driven by my February start. While cold and dry conditions don’t
concern me very much (I actually enjoy cold weather), cold and wet situations
can be dangerous, and I want to ensure that I have dry base and mid layers to
change into at the end of the day.   
There is a term called “packing your fears” in long
distance hiking, which just means you tend to toss a bunch of “extra” stuff in
the bag to counteract those fears.  Cold + wet is my primary fear, and there is probably an extra pound or
so of clothing mid-layers in there as a result. 
Fortunately, I have family members meeting me with
a car on both my 14th trail day and my 21st trail day, so I will have the
opportunity to conveniently discard / swap some items.  
One
thing that is almost guaranteed:  I will not
have the exact same collection of stuff in my bag on Day 22 as I will on Day
1.  Also, there will be a pretty significant
change-over once the threat of snow on the trail is mostly in the rear-view
mirror….I have a lighter sleeping bag that will replace the Day 1 version, and
also a couple of the previously mentioned clothing layers are likely to get ejected as well.  Finally, there will be a point when I swap over
from boots to trail runners (at least that is my current plan).  Anyway, none of these decisions are life-critical…it’s
just about finding the right balance between pack-weight comfort, and other types
of comfort.  I will learn along the way which
decisions make the most sense for me.",,View Entry,"Feb 13, Mon",0

mile zero on the AT on top of Springer Mountain in north Georgia.  
Sometime mid-morning on Saturday, I will start out
from Amicalola Falls State Park, and hike the 8 miles to get to the starting point
(yes, there is an 8 mile “approach trail” to Springer summit that doesn’t count
toward the mileage in the AT).   
I’m super-excited that I will have two folks seeing
me off from Amicalola:  My daughter, who will be driving me to AFSP Saturday morning from her
college a couple hours away (I am traveling into
her college town the night before); and my buddy Kevin who lives in the metro
Atlanta area.  I believe that both are
planning to hike up some of the famous Amicalola stairs along the falls in the
park, before bidding me adieu.  I fibbed a bit to my daughter and told her that the stairs were pedestrian-friendly.  We shall see whether I get an earful about that one. :)  I know that I will be comparing the Amicalola stairs to the 212 stairs that I had to traverse multiple times a day back in my college years to get from the main campus to my dorm on Mt. Olympus (an actual hill in Syracuse...not the mythical Greek one).

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660185,"It was an enjoyable last day in the non-trail world.  Mrs Rambler, along with our co-pilot golden retriever, drove me down to the Charlotte area and handed me off to my daughter for the last legs of my vehicular journey.   We picked a nice county park just outside Charlotte for the handoff, a gorgeous spot with a lake, piers for fishing, lots of waking trails, and a skeet shooting range of all things.  Since I had no fishing rods or ballistic weaponry with me, I limited our visit to a short stroll with the pup along the walkways on a blustery afternoon.  The crackle of shotguns obliterating clay disks on the other end of the park made for a rhythmic soundtrack to the walk.  For those about to walk….fire….we salute you!   


It was tough to say goodbye to Mrs Rambler and the pup, and I’m so thankful for the support that I have been given in advance of this little sojourn.  


My daughter ferried me onward to the beautiful campus of Clemson University where I’m spending my last night in a soft bed for a while.   I got a great refresher tour of the campus on a sunny afternoon, and it was great to hear about all the positive experiences that have happened in her educational journey thus far.  I’m super proud of this young adult who is making her mark in this world.  


We will be hitting a local pizza place for a meal and then probably shutting it down pretty early to get ready to launch tomorrow morning.  Amicalola Falls, here I come.",,View Entry,"Feb 17, Fri",0
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660208,"What an incredible first day on this journey.  I broke camp from the rustic confines of the Hilton in Clemson this  morning, and my daughter drove us the couple hours over to Amicalola SP. I had no idea cattle farming was such a big business in Upstate SC and North GA.  Cows EVERYWHERE.  


We got in to the park at 9:30, and checked in with the volunteers who support the AT.  We sat through a brief tutorial on Leave No Trace Principles.  We all need to work together to keep these finite public resources in a condition that will be supportive of the generations to come behind us.   


My buddy Kevin arrived halfway through the lecture, and it was great to have him join the fun for the morning.    


After getting all my gear pulled together, Kevin and my daughter and I all tackled the 800-ish stairs that ascend the namesake waterfall.  I gotta say, it lived up to its reputation. The falls, and the pools that they formed were absolutely gorgeous.  Kevin is a natural athlete in the prime of his career, so my daughter and I had a tough time keeping up with him, but eventually the three of us made it to the top of the falls.  


It was time to say goodbye to my daughter and let her get back to Clemson.  I cherished the 18 hours catching up her with since yesterday afternoon, and I can’t wait to see her again in a couple weeks when she brings her brother out to the trail to join me (more in that in another entry later).  


Kevin continued on with me for another couple miles of the Approach Trail, and we had a fantastic time catching up.   KO and I have known each other since the college days, and anytime we get together, it’s like two brothers catching up as if no time has elapsed since the last conversation. KO also served as a great Chronicler of the morning’s events, and I really appreciated his multimedia activity.   Look for the movie trailers in a theater near you.  


KO, thanks my brother! 


After KO peeled off to return to the car and the Atlanta suburbs, the solo journey began.   Another couple hours got me to the top of Springer Mountain, the official Mile 0 of northbound thru hikers.  There was quite a collection of thru hikers there taking a breather and enjoying the fine view.  Based on what I had read, I wasn’t expecting much of a view here, but apparently the forest service had just come in a few days prior and cleared a few trees that enabled a really fine view off to the west with all the North GA foothills.  


A ridge runner named Moxie was at the summit providing all manner of advice and encouragement to the thru hikers, day hikers and section hikers who were coming through.  She was an incredibly positive and knowledgeable person and we are lucky that the ATC invests in having a small cadre of these  folks on the trail. 


After a few photos (it’s mile zero for Petes sake, you gotta take pictures!), and signing the log, I pushed on for the last three miles which an easy downhill to Stover Creek shelter.  I spent much of the three miles having a great conversation with a thru hiker names Chris, since our stride and pace seemed pretty similar.   Super nice guy taking a break from high school teaching in the Richmond area.  

The shelter site had quite a collection of thru hikers,  probably 15, and there was a small group of Boy Scouts doing a shakedown hike for the Philmont trip (google it if interested), One of the hikers had a chill dog named Luna that was quickly everybody’s best friend.   
Everyone was exchanging information and hiking stories, as most were understandably jacked up with excitement over getting their journeys underway.


In addition to Chris, there was Phil from eastern Canada, Niles from Maine, Jane from KY, Solo from OH, Rob from Tampa, Josai from north GA, and a few others that I’m struggling to remember.  


Oh yeah, I promised myself that these posts were not going to be heavily burdened with weather reports, but today was a top ten chamber of commerce weather day for hiking….cloudless blue skies, temps in the low fifties, perfect. 

I was also getting encouraging texts throughout the day from friends and family, which really sent me off in a great frame of mind.
overall, just a perfect day!  One final note: the Approach Trail to the AT is 8.8 miles long, but it screws up the math for the rest of the entries if I include it, so my 11.6 mile day shows as only 2.8. For the rest of the entries when “total trip miles are shown, it will always be light by that same 8.8   Whoever thought we would need that math we learned in elementary school?!","Amicalola Falls SP

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660209,"I slept reasonably well last night though my mind was still having a hard time transitioning from planning mode to doing mode….lots of contingency plans were swirling in my head for a while before sleep came.  


I got out of camp at 8:30 after cooking up breakfast and packing up my gear.   Today was one of the easier sections in this region of the AT.  Mostly just rolling hills.   I was impressed by the number of different types of users of the woodlands around the trail.  The region is crisscrossed with Forest Service roads that are open to the public.  I saw everything from day campers/hikers, to mountain bikers, dirt bikers and four wheelers.  There were trail runners (including one guy running In sandals (I couldn’t do that). Most surprising was seeing active duty infantrymen doing ranger training.   Those guys were ready to kick ass and take names.  I’m glad we have the worlds finest military protecting our borders and interests. 


I stopped at Hawk Mountain shelter for an early lunch at 10:30, and a few other folks from the first night trickled in during the 20 minutes or so that I was there. I continued pushing through the rolling hills until Gooch Shelter at 3:00.  Many of the same folks from last night are here at this shelter, along with some additional weekend hikers (no surprise on a weekend that is a three day weekend for some folks). 


For those who haven’t hiked, the above picture is the shelter.  There is typically a three sided structure with room for anywhere from
6 to 20 people to sleep depending on the site.  Usually arrayed around the periphery are several flat spots where tents can be pitched.   I’m usually a tent guy, and that was true last night as well.  


Through two days, I’m reasonably happy with my equipment and food planning I  have a bit too much food right now, but I’ll get that dialed in as the days progress.  I also have a couple extra base layers that probably need to go, but I don’t want to make any decisions on that until I encounter something other than the perfect weather I’ve had for two days  


The only addition that will forthcoming to my pack contents is adding in a spare battery battery pack for my phone. While I really don’t see the phone as “necessary “ equipment, I am enjoying staying in touch with friends and family using text, phone, FarOut and this journal.   I am down to about 25 battery after two days, even with having the phone shut completely off for significant chunks of time.  I really want to be in a position where I am not worrying about stopping somewhere off trail to recharge every three days…so battery pack it is.  


I’m actually uploading this post and the day 1 post at the end of my third day of hiking , as a I found a spot with connectivity and an electrical outlet. More on that in tomorrow’s post.","Stover Creek Shelter
",Gooch Shelter,"Feb 19, Sun",12.90
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660234,"Really good day today!  My original plan was to go 12 miles to the Woods Hole Shelter, with a 15 miler to follow on Tuesday.  However, my legs felt strong at the beginning of the day, and the battery on my phone was pretty low, so I started thinking that getting all the way up and over Blood Mountain and down to the Mountain Crossing outfitter in Neels Gap might be the way to go.   I figured I would make the game time decision when I reached the original destination. 



The terrain was hillier than yesterday, but still very manageable, and with the leaves still off the trees, there were abundant views.  For quite a while I was up on a ridge doing a several mile circle around a farm that was tucked down in the valley below the ridge.  Beautiful spot for whoever owns that homestead. 



There were plenty of people out on the last day of the holiday weekend. I crossed paths with numerous thru hikers and day hikers.  One interesting dude who called himself Speedbump because he slows everybody else down with his propensity to chat on trail, was carrying a nicely carved and labeled walking stick.  His hobby is apparently making these sticks and giving them to thru hikers who might want to take them all the way to Maine.  He said he gave away 21 of them last year.  There is a hobby for everybody I guess.  Since I was all set with my trekking poles, I politely declined his offer and continued on.  


I spent most of the day leap frigging back and forth with Chris and Josai as we would each take our breaks at different times and move ahead or fall behind.  


I stopped for lunch at a really nice cascade and refueled myself for the rest of the day.  I hit the 12 mile mark before 2, and my energy and legs felt good, so I made the decision to push on to Blood Mountain and Neels Gap. 
The summit of Blood was quite spectacular, and I can see why it is a popular day hike up from Neels gap. It was the first summit of the hike that reminded me a little bit of the New England peaks that I’m accustomed to.  There was quite a bit of open rock slab and some spectacular views in almost every direction. 
The really cool thing is the shelter that is sitting perched on the summit.  It was built back in the Depression era by the Civilian Conservation Core (google them).  It’s built of rock instead of the normal wood, and has stood the test of time.  That said , it’s apparently not a very attractive place to spend the night because those rock walls trap in the moisture and cold, and it’s also super windy there on an the highest peak in the region. 


Oh yeah, forgot to mention that Blood Mountain is the highest peak in the GA section of the AT, so I guess it’s all downhill to the NC border (hmmmm, maybe not).  


After Blood, I scrambled down the somewhat steep descent into Neels gap, and got there about an hour before closing of the awesome outfitter that is located there.  I was able to buy a couple food items and other consumables, and get this….take a shower!   I felt like a million bucks after that shower, and spent the early evening recharging my phone and catching up with family while sitting on their outdoor stone patio.  I think their building was also a CCC project back in the day, but not 100% sure if that.  Anyway, for a store located in a fairly rural area, holy crap did they have a incredible selection of hiking gear and consumables.  And it was very reasonably priced to boot.  These guys have a great reputation in the hiker community and I can see why. 


I snapped a photo of their famous tree which collects the shoes of hikers who have either decided their shoes aren’t right, or they are quitting the trail, or both.  My boots did not get launched into that tree, in case you are wondering.  


I am spending the night camped in the woods behind the outfitter.  Since I don’t have a very long day planned tomorrow, I plan to make use of their services when they open again at 9.  Hot coffee!","Gooch Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660235,"After catching up with everyone last night, I did my first bear hang of my food on this trip.  It’s been a couple years since I’ve done it, as I always seem to camp at spots that have bear boxes or bear cables, but last night was rope and carabiner time.  


Since I was only about 500 yards away from the roadway, the occasional traffic noise, especially the trucks using their Jake brakes, made falling off to sleep a bit of a challenge.   Also, the wind was roaring up through the gap last night and brought in some scattered showers. While I do like the sound of both the wind and the rain, when it combined with the cars last night, sleep took a while to come.  


For the morning, I went right back down to the patio with the picnic tables and had a great breakfast overlooking the gap.   Since I had a shorter day planned today (so I thought) I lounged around the outfitters until about 10:15 and had a couple cups of coffee and a cold Gatorade. 


I was treated to another sunny day with warm temps and ridge tops that offered frequent vistas. I’m not sure if it was the late start, the miles from yesterday, the beckoning vistas, nutrition choices, or what, but the 11.5 miles today did not feel like a walk in the park, and I found myself stopping a lot more than normal today.  Not a bad thing, just different. 


I crossed paths with a dude who was 73 miles into an 85 mile trail RUN. He had been awake for 35 hours.  Guys like that are just wired different. 


I made it into Low Gap shelter at about 4pm. 




By the way, it takes me a while to get used to Gap everything around here.  I guess different regions have their different terms: Notches in New England, Passes in the west, and I’m forgetting a few other variants.  Feel free to let me know your favorite local term for “low spot where you annoyingly lose all the elevation you just spent an hour gaining “.   Anyway, I went through so many gaps today, I felt the need to put on a pair khakis and a color coordinated polo shirt (this journal is safe haven for Dad jokes). 


At the shelter here this evening are a couple from the Adirondacks (Encore and his wife), Chris from the first two nights, Elyise from Quebec who is veterinarian, and three guys that I had chatted with earlier in the day…Andy, a Alabama county district attorney who is section hiking, SoupCup who is a guy from Maine by way of Idaho, and Bearded Frog, a central PA guy who has a YouTube channel.  Everyone of them were super friendly, and we had a great time chowing down our various versions of freeze dried food and trading stories.  


13 miles planned for tomorrow.","
",Low Gap Shelter,"Feb 21, Tue",11.60
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660236,"I woke up today a little worried about the tiredness I had felt yesterday, given that I had a 13 miler planned for both today and Thursday before I came of trail Thursday night for my first stay in a hiker hostel. I had my breakfast while chatting with the folks in camp, and was on my way by 8:30 ish. 


My worries about the mileage were quickly allayed, as I felt great all throughout the morning climbs.  I got to Blue Mountain shelter at 11:45, and enjoyed its views over Unicoi gap.  I lingered a bit longer than I have been typically doing for lunch since the sun was out and the views were addictive. Most of the folks from the shelter last night also arrived there while I was lallygagging


It was then a fairly steep descent into Unicoi gap, which has a big parking lot for the trailhead.  As I got within sight of the lot, I could see a white van with million stickers, and folding tables and chairs and grills.  This could mean only one thing: Fresh Ground’s Leap Frog cafe was in the house.  


Okay, time for a quick introduction to a couple fantastic elements of long distance hiking culture. There are folks out there called Trail Angels, who out of the goodness of their hearts, set up at various spots where trails intersect with roads, and offer various forms of support, usually in the form or food.  These folks don’t really fit a particular mold…they might be from a church group, they might be past hikers themselves who want to give back, or they are just local folks who get some joy out of helping others. When a hiker encounters this wonderful surprise, it’s called Trail Magic. Today was my first Trail Magic of the hike (or ever for that matter). 


And a bit more about Fresh Ground.  This guy is the Uber-pinnacle of Trail Angels.  He actually drives up and down the east coast all throughout hiking season and pops up at crossings and lays out a killer spread.  Fresh Ground has been doing this for ELEVEN years!  He does an annual fundraiser to defray some of the expenses, but the guy is incredible.  I believe that he had made some bad choices early in his life, and sees this as a way to somewhat atone.  Whatever the reason, he is legendary in the hiker world.   


His van is also part of the scene.  It is plastered with stickers, and he has every hiker autograph the inside of his van, with a sharpie, which is amazing.  He has also had some customization done, and there are several USB chargers protruding through the side of the van with a shelf welded onto the side of the van, so that you can charge your phone while you eat the food he cooks for you. OMG, perfection.  


So,  I availed myself of a burrito, salad, oranges and Gatorade. They never tasted so good.  Chris and Andy also both made it down to the gap while I was there, so the three of us all chowed together.  There was also a German gal there, Paulina, who was just finishing her visit when I arrived.  


As good as my legs had felt throughout the morning, I had already been thinking about tacking on some extra miles (and elevation gain) to push on to Tray Mountain shelter instead of my intended destination of Cheese Factory tent site. With the energy boost from Fresh Ground (both caloric and mental) the decision was pretty much made.  I pounded out a 1000 foot gain, a nine hundred foot drop and another 500 ft gain over the next four miles or so to get to Cheese Factory (no, not Cheesecake Factory).  It’s apparently the site of an abandoned cheese making facility from back in the day.  I didn’t see any evidence of old structures, but I also didn’t look very hard.  With Tray Mountain shelter only another couple miles and 900 feet or so, and with the nagging worry that Chester Cheeto might be stalking me from the woods ,  I pushed on. 


The summit of Tray Mountain offered some really nice views, and I took the opportunity for some photos before continuing the final quarter mile to the shelter.  It’s a really nice spot up on the ridge, and my tent is parked where I could see both the sunset, and I will get sunrise in the morning. 


I was pretty late arriving at 5:30, so most people had already eaten and gotten relatively settled. Chris, who now has the trail name Stickers, arrived shortly after me, and we chatted with a few of the folks, but not for long. 


It’s now 8pm, which is well after “hiker midnight”, so it’s time to shut down.  


Relatively short day tomorrow, 11 miles to get down to Dicks Creek Gap, and the Around the Bend hostel.  They have beds, shower, Wi-Fi , and shuttles into Hiawassee , where I’m hoping to have a nice meal and do some resupply.","Low Gap Shelter
",Tray Mountain Shelter,"Feb 22, Wed",15.60
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660317,"At the end of yesterday’s post, I confidently indicated that my tent was positioned to catch a sunrise in the morning.  Well, that might have been the case, but unfortunately  heavy clouds and fog ruled the morning, so no sunrise for me.  In fact, the weather overnight was, well, impressive.  The wind picked up and roared in sometime between 8 and midnight and sounded like a freight train all night.  Mother Nature was flexing her muscles a bit.  Fortunately, my tent was well staked and held up against the pressures.  A few times when my eyes were open, I could see the bending and flexing of the poles that form the frame of the tent…I guess that whoever designed the tent had that kind of reaction in mind.  


Unfortunately, the wind did keep me awake for much of the night, so I was pretty sluggish when I got rolling out of camp.   The sluggishness remained throughout most of the morning walk, but I knew I had a pot of gold at the end of this morning‘s rainbow: Around the Bend hostel. This hostel for hikers is relatively new, but already quite legendary in the through hiker community. The hostel sits very close to the actual trail, which makes it somewhat unusual in itself, because usually it’s a relatively long shuttle to get to many of the hostels. I reached the intersection of the Trail and Dicks Creek gap at about 1:30, chatted with a couple thru hikers who were taking a break, and then quickly walked the half mile down the road to the hostel. When I came around the bend, there was a very tidy looking set of buildings with a LOT of activity. I understood from talking to several other hikers that they were sold out for the night so I was glad that I had made my reservation several days early. The owner of the hostel was actually pulling out of the driveway in a vehicle when I arrived and he rolled down the window and greeted me. Gordon seems to be a super nice fellow and runs a good enterprise.  His helpers quickly and professionally showed me the facility and got me checked into my nice little cabin. They offer a number of different styles of rooms from shared bunk rooms where you are in a room with perhaps six or eight other people, to single rooms to the little cabin, which is basically a shed that has been reconfigured.  They had a number of really comfortable common areas and there were loads of people milling around and exchanging stories. I was able to quickly take a shower and toss my nasty clothes into the washing machine and once again I felt like a new man. 


One thing that was a little concerning, was that they had a scale in the bathroom and when I stepped on it I was down 10 pounds from six days earlier,. I suspected that I had not been putting enough calories into my body, and that confirmed it. It’s probably also part of the reason for my sluggishness earlier in the day. So clearly, I had a massive green light for gorging over the next several hours. I proceeded to eat in rapid succession: a Klondike bar, a frozen pizza, multiple sodas, chips and oranges just while sitting In the common rooms of the hostel.  


At 5:00, several of us took the shuttle into Hiawasse (the town close by) and I laid siege on the all you can buffet at Daniels steak house. Piles of salad and fried chicken and ribs and slaw and pasta salad were shoved into my gullet.   I did skip the dessert bar, because you know, I’m watching my waistline.  


We all then walked a couple blocks over the local Ingles supermarket, and purchased resupplies of food for the next several days on trail before we hit Franklin NC, the next trail town.  I should also mention that Around the Bend also is an outfitter, and they have a great shed full of supplies, everything from food to boots to backpacks.  I had actually procured some of the foods that I needed for the upcoming miles prior to shuttling into Hiawasse, since I prefer to support local business like that over larger chains when possible.  


With a couple small grocery bags full of foodstuffs in one hand and a six pack to Two Bells Lighthearted Ale in the other, I jumped back in the shuttle to return to ATB. I shared the ales with some other folks in the common room. It was a real pleasure meeting Daddy Llama, a gent from FL who had recently sold his wealth management business that he had built for 30+ years.  He had done a long distance hike out west pre-Covid, and decided he needed to find a way to do more hiking and less wealth managing.  Hmmmm, I like that concept.  I had actually run into him the day earlier, and this guy is built for speed and miles.  He will be on top of Katahdin at least a month before me.
The energy (and the beer) dissipated just after 8, and it was time to return to my shed, I mean cabin.  I am planning to only do small miles tomorrow (a “nero” or nearly zero in hiker speak).","Tray Mountain Shelter
",Dicks Creek Gap - Around the Bend Hostel,"Feb 23, Thu",11.10
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660318,"The night at ATB was wonderfully restful, and I awoke feeling energized for my upcoming low energy day.  The room rate included a continental breakfast, and I was happy to sit down to food that I didn’t have to retrieve out of a nylon sack and boil in water.  And coffee from a a pot, not a packet! I shared great conversation with Deciever and his significant other Kate, a young couple who both taking a sabbatical from a medical device manufacturer. When they return they are getting posted to a startup site in Australia which is exciting for them.  


Since I was not planning to really start hiking until noonish, I made use of the comfortable common room to take care of a few emails and touch base with Mrs Rambler to hear how her hikes up and down the beaches of SC with the pup are progressing.   I wanted to make a couple other calls, but unfortunately, while I had Wi-Fi, I did not have cell coverage, so I could only call those who I knew had FaceTime.  


I also took the time to reserve a room for next Monday at a hostel in Franklin.  Franklin is a well-known town on the trail and has a lot of services for hikers, including good resupply options.   Finally, I found that ATB actually had cell phone batteries for sale, so I now have more battery capacity (and unfortunately, more weight) in my backpack. I wish I had realized that the previous night so that I could have fully charged the battery, but between the phone itself and the spare battery I have plenty to get me to Franklin.  


As it turned out, there was a shuttle headed back to the Dicks Creek trailhead at 10:30, and since I was pretty much buttoned up, I decided to go ahead and get rolling.  It was a bit tough to leave the comfy confines of ATB, but there were miles that needed to be done. I also had heard that the chance of rain was increasing throughout the day, so I was hoping that I might get to my intended destination while still dry.  The van load included Deceiver and Kate, Stickers, Rental, and Unicorn. 


Boots hit dirt at 10:45, and I started marching uphill. Even though I only had seven miles planned for the day, it included 2400 ft of elevation gain, so energy needed to be spent.  It was a quite toasty climb as Georgia has not seemed to realize that winter typically includes cool weather.  


On the hike I encountered a southbound hiker named Long Story who is only 70 miles from completing the trail.  He started last March, and has been taking four to eight week bites of the apple, with various length breaks mixed in.  He shared a pretty funny story that when he first got started, he didn’t realize that the FarOut app didn’t actually communicate the CheckIns outbound if there was no cell coverage or your phone was in airplane mode. As a result he went six days though western Maine without sending any outbound communication to his wife.   She understandably got a tad worried and the authorities were contacted.  He had been staying at hostels off and on throughout the six days, so the manhunt didn’t exactly require the complexity of looking for Amelia Earhart.   All is well that ends well.  


I reached my planned tent site , an unnamed spot a couple miles south of the nc/ga border, before 2:00, which is pretty early to shut down for the day.  It was not raining, and my legs felt strong, so I had to make the call whether I was going to stick to the plan of resting my body with a Nero, or push on.   For once, I did the smart thing and decided to call it a day.   I figured that it would be nice to get the tent set up while it was still dry, and since I now had plenty of battery, I could maybe catch up on a couple journaling items that I wanted to accomplish.  Deceiver and Kate, Rental and Unicorn from the shuttle all passed through having decided they were going to push to Bly Gap or beyond.  I think Stickers was going to head on to Muskrat Creek shelter , but I didn’t actually see him go by. 


About ten minutes after I got my tent set up, the rain started, so I was feeling pretty smug about my decision.  Over the past week of good weather, I have been trying to get the speed of my tent setup faster and faster, so that when the afternoon eventually arrives when I have to set up in the rain, I can get it done without the inside of the tent getting totally soaked before completion.  I guess I have had a week of dry runs (sigh).  Look for me on the next season of Netflix’s Drive to Survive; I’ll be setting up a tent in the time it takes the Red Bull racing guys to change tires.  


I got a quick bite of dinner into me before finding a good spot to hang my bear bag, and then shut it down for the night pretty early.","Dicks Creek Gap - Around the Bend Hostel

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660319,"What a difference a day makes!  With the rain that came in last night, the temps dropped significantly as well.  I got underway a bit earlier than normal after deciding to go with a cold breakfast instead of standing around in the rain waiting for water to boil.  


I wasn’t on trail for more than 10 minutes, when I heard another hiker coming up from behind.  It turns out that Stickers had decided to stay at the shelter a couple miles back.  He had stopped for what was going to be a quick break, but unfortunately got some news that his mom had broken both legs in a freak home accident that day.  So, after numerous communications back home, he decided to stay put.  Best wishes for a speedy recovery, Stickers’ Mom. 


It sounds like it was a quite full house at that shelter, with much snoring blending in with the sounds of the forest.  I’m happy I had my little corner of the woods that I chose all to myself.  


I wish that I could pepper this journal entry with commentary about many spectacular views,  but unfortunately I was walking through clouds and rain all day, and visibility averaged about 100 feet. 


I leapfrogged all day with Rental, Unicorn, Deceiver, Kate, Elyise, and Stickers.  And it was just plain wet and chilly all day. I really didn’t want to stop moving for more than about 5 minutes because then the wind, cold, and wet would do its work.  All day I was trying to dial in which layers made the most sense; often I was going with just shorts and t shirt, since I generate a lot of heat climbing, but at times I added in my rain jacket to break the wind that was coming across the ridges.  With my rain jacket, I generally like to keep the hood down, because I get tunnel vision from the sides and low visor of the hood.  At one point, I had put the hood up due to increased rain and wind, and sure enough, I emphatically smacked my head against a low hanging branch.  I know that I mentioned the visibility was low, but I was seeing a good set of stars through the fog at that particular moment. 


The highlights of the day came early: just after 8am, I crossed the border from GA to NC!  Georgia, you were good to me, I enjoyed your hills, your weather, and especially your people.  Sadly though, Georgia, you are no longer on my mind. 


Just after the border, I came through Bly Gap with its famous gnarled tree. Stickers and I were hiking together at that moment , so we were able to each take a couple snapshots.  We also ran into Elyise, who was just getting rolling after tenting close to Bly that evening.  


I trudged up and over Standing Indian mountain which was 5500 feet high, but was a fairly gentle ascent.   With the elevation, the wind picked up considerably, so there was no lingering about. 


Before I started my day, I had planned to go only as far Beech Gap tentsite (14 miles). As I approached the site and it was still early in the afternoon, I briefly considered continuing on to Carter Gap shelter,  but the rain had briefly let up, and I decided it would be good to get the tent set up in light rain rather than heavy rain. 


Even though many of the people I was hiking around were pushing on to the Carter gap shelter, I felt good about my decision to stay in Beach gap. It was a beautiful little spot even if I couldn’t see more than 100 feet as I set up my tent underneath an overhanging canopy of rhododendrons. 



There were signs posted all around warning about bear activity, and there were several posts in FarOut about the same topic from spring of last year, so care would need to be taken with the food hang for the night.  
Just after setting up, the five people who I had been leapfrogging with all day, plus another two I saw for the first time all walked through and decided to go on to Carter. 


Elyise,the vet from Quebec, did decide to stay in the same camping area so at least there was one other person nearby. I decided to eat pretty early (4 o’clock), and had my food bag hung in the tree by 5, and I was relaxing in my tent by 530.   The relatively gentle winds in the gap, along with the easing raindrops quickly had me unconscious. 


On a completely random side note, I need your help, dear reader.  I don’t listen to music on my phone while I’m waking, so I’m at the mercy of whatever song my addled brain happens to decide to put onto “random shuffle” for the day.  I can usually get a different song into my head, but it takes effort. For the last couple days, I have had Bob Marley’s “Three Little Birds” stuck on repeat.  Occasionally the Proclaimers “I’m Gonna Be” (the walk 500 miles song) sneaks into the mix as well.  Both are good songs in their own right, but it’s time for something new.  Any suggestions? I’m a classic rock and alt rock kind of guy, so Rap, Country, and Polka’s will probably be rejected due to lack of familiarity.  If any of you from San Diego have a weatherman who could recommend something with a little bit of jazz flute, all the better.","No Name Tentsite

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660320,"What a difference a day makes, part deux.  When I first emerged from my tent, I thought the day might be a repeat of the prior day’s wet slog.  Low clouds / fog were rolling through the gap, making everything damp.  By the time I cooked my breakfast and started packing up however, there were starting to be signs that it might be a brighter day after all.  The wind had picked up (in a good way) and moved the low lying condensation out of the area, and I was even able to hang a few items for a half-hour or so before departure in order to jump start the drying process.   


A note about the moisture: even though the tent keeps me perfectly dry from falling rain, when the air has 99%+ humidity (like in foggy conditions), everything just gets wet, period.  Actually yesterday, for much of the hike, there wasn’t actual rain falling from the clouds, however the trees were picking up so much moisture from the passing clouds/fog, that the leaves and branches were “raining” down on me.  Ok, enough verbiage on meteorology, Al Roker.  


Also, there was no evidence of bear activity last night, despite the signage. Interestingly throughout the first week on trail, there has been essentially zero wildlife of any sort.  No birds. No squirrels.  No deer. No lions,  tigers, or bears, oh my!  I may have heard an owl one night, but that’s it. 


I was on trail by 7:45, and soon the sun was out, and visibility was fantastic.  After about an hour , I stopped for a quick break at Carter Gap shelter, which apparently had about a dozen folks staying there last night. Only one person was still there, William, a good guy from the north shore MA.  About a mile past he shelter was a beautiful vista overlooking the valleys to east.  The sun was now out in full force, so I took the opportunity to relax and take it all in.  A nice moment.  Since I was up on a ridge , I had cell coverage, so I called Gooders Grove hostel to get my shuttle into Franklin squared away for Monday morning.   I am going to be staying very close to the pickup point tonight, so Monday will definitely be a Nero…probably only about an hour of walking in the woods.  


Throughout the morning, I passed through a number of gaps , almost all of which offered some nice camping spots.  As I came through Mooney Gap, I put a few calories into my system and filled up water bottles from one of the many sources that were full from yesterday’s rain. 


Shortly thereafter, the fire tower on top of Albert Mountain became visible in the distance, and the challenge for the day was now obvious on the horizon.  The last quarter mile to the top was the steepest section of the AT thus far, but OMG the reward was totally worth it!  The rocky top offered views in every direction, and a quick jaunt up the fire tower stairs rewarded me with views for close to 100 miles.  Off to the northwest was the looming spine of the Smokies, which will be testing my mettle (and my son’s) in a bit over a week.  



The sun had stayed out, and there was minimal breeze, and I didn’t have significant mileage remaining that afternoon. As such, a powerful magnet kept my butt attached to the summit rock, and I basked in the completely different environment than what I encountered yesterdayDeceiver and Kate were also at the summit, and we chatted a bit and snapped a few non-selfie photos to capture the moment.  


I did still have a half dozen miles to go before my evening destination, so eventually I had to pack up and roll on. The rest of the afternoon’s walk was a pleasant stroll through the rolling hills of the area.  As is often the case, I encountered blue blazed side trails that offered views into the surrounding valleys.  I’m usually pretty sleective about bothering with these side trails, since the mileage can add up after a while, but for some reason one caught my eye tiis afternoon.  It was no more than thirty yards or so, and the way the sun was angled at that particular moment, I could tell that the valley was going to be illuminated quite spectacularly. What I couldn’t tell until I reached the view-spot is that my timing had me staring into a beautiful rainbow hovering over that valley.  Wow.  I’m not quite sure what in our primitive brains makes us think that rainbows and beautifully lit valleys are attractive, but I don’t care….it was pretty damn cool.  


Also, a big round number alert…ding ding ding, somewhere just after Albert Mountain summit, I completed the first 100 miles of the northbound AT!  A quick celebratory dance occurred on trail for the momentous occasion. Well, not really, but it should have. I’m not sure why 100 is any more momentous than 44 or 89 (probably something to do with the number of fingers and toes), but it feels good to have that notch on my figurative belt.  


I continued on for another hour or so until I reached the Rock Gap shelter.  When I arrived, two folks immediately greeted me, and let me know that they were cooking up trail Magic a couple hundred yards down the trail at the parking area for Rock Gap.  Sweet!!!!  I quickly unpacked a couple wet items to get them drying in the late afternoon sun, and then shuffled down the trail toward the Magical destination.   Before I could even get down there, two Angels were walking up the trail with a plateful of food for me.  A dude with a British accent, and his young son were DELIVERING trail Magic to me!   I believe the Angels were Beetle and Peeps, and I have that wrong, it’s just because the alarm bells signaling the presence of food were clanging too loudly in my head.  I returned to the shelter with a ham and cheese quesadilla, oranges, cookies, candy bars, Coke, and a Fat Tire beer.  Score!   While I was currently the only resident of the shelter, I suspected Deciever and Kate might come along shortly, so I kept the primal instincts at bay and only finished 99% of the food (jk, there was lots left for D&K). 


BTW, I was one of the very first evening residents of RG shelter.  There has been a shelter located there at the site for years (decades?) but this past fall/winter the old one was torn down and a new one built.  They literally just got the roof and walls finished within the last couple days to get it inhabitable.  Since it was so new, and clearly had been constructed with my specific visit in mind, I decided that tonight would be my first night sleeping in a shelter instead of my tent.  


Deceiver and Kate did indeed come along shortly after my arrival, and we shared some nice conversation over Magic and dinner.  They set up their tent, and the three of us were the only humans there for the evening.  A little mouse nibbling on my backpack  at 11:00 reminded me that there were others laying claim to the property as well.  


Well boys and girls, Count von Count would like to remind you that today’s episode is brought to you by the numbers 100 and 360:
100 miles complete, 
100 mile visibility for 360 degrees on Albert Mtn.

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660358,"It was a good night sleep at the brand new shelter (other than the little visitor trying to nibble my backpack….eventually the shelter will have nails to hang backpacks, but the shelter is so new, mine spent the night sitting on the same platform as my sleeping body). 


I cooked up a quick breakfast and was just getting ready for my short four mile day, when Trail Angel Lucky Moon came walking up to the site, and let the three of us (incl Deceiver and Kate) know that she and Wise Acres were doing morning trail Magic at the parking lot down below. Two Magics in 12 hours!   Time to play the lotto.   


I was cooked up a nice plate of scrambled eggs, and I also enjoyed some fresh oranges.   I felt a bit bad, however, because I could not stop and chat for too long….I had arranged for Zen the hostel owner to pick me up at Winding Stair Gap at 9:30.  It was four miles down the trail and already 8:15.  I thanked the Angels profusely, and skeedaddled down the trail.  I made it to WSG at exactly 9:30, and Zen and his two dogs were waiting for me there with a van.  


I got to to know Zen a bit during the 20-ish minute ride into Franklin.  He is a Franklin native, and moved on from his family newspaper business a few years back, and opened the Gooder Grove hostel.  Very conveniently located just a couple blocks from the heart of downtown, it’s an “eclectic” place that is very welcoming to hikers and our particular needs.  He and his partner Star Waffle got me situated, and I was in a hot shower within about 12 nanoseconds to wash the trail off me.  Everyone downwind from me thanked me profusely for that.  


Stickers had come into town the night before, and I quickly ran into him in the hostel common area.  We decided to head into town and start the process of running errands, and consuming mass quantities of food. While Akroyd and the cone head family may not have been impressed, I did kick things off nicely with a fantastic bagel sandwich from Brooklyn Bagel.   They didn’t have any seating, so Stickers and I walked a half block to the town square and ate our meal like a couple drifters.  


Speaking of drifters, while we were chowing, Moon Pants and Socks, a pair of young thru hiker gals from Maine stopped by.  We had run into them a couple nights back.  They were laughing pretty hard, because they had just been stopped by the police, as a townsperson had called in worried that they might be runaways.  They proceeded to show their ID’s and all was well.  I guess it’s a good thing that someone would think to be worried about that…humans looking out for other humans.   


Also while we sat there in the square, we were notified that it was indeed noon, since unbeknownst to us, we had plunked down next to a massive set of bells that chimed out the 12 noon notes.  Soothing music to help the bagel digest properly. 


Stickers and I headed into the outfitter across the street, Outdoor 76.  We ran into a number of other thru hikers, including Indiana, RNTUL and Unicorn among others.  I was able to get a replacement water bladder for collecting unfiltered water.  My Sawyer Squeeze bag had developed two pinprick holes the day before, which is not a good thing.  I chose a CNOC bladder which seems to be ubiquitous on the trail.  Hoping it gives me good service. 




The best part about Outdoor 76: they have perfected “Gear and Beer.”  Under one roof, separated only by a low swinging door is a full-selection outdoor outfitter, AND a craft beer bar.  I would have felt terrible if I left there without supporting the local economy, so I sampled an IPA or two. 


  
The town square also had a huge sign welcoming thru hikers, with a big basket of sharpies hanging there for all to autograph. I obliged.  They will need to hang onto that sign, as it will clearly be worth at least a dollar now that my signature is on there.  


It had now been at least 90 minutes since I had eaten anything, so clearly this one man swarm of locusts needed to move on to the next food spot.  I managed to walk a grueling one block down to the Lazy Hiker. Technically, the LH only offers liquid calories, but a semi-permanently parked food truck outside delivers food into the LH, so, yeah.  If the editors from Bon Appetit call, just let them know that food truck gyros pair nicely with LH Amblin Amber.  


I was there at LH for maybe 90 minutes, and it was thru hiker central. Navigator, Deceiver and Kate, Stickers, and a few others all drifted in and out.  A nice surprise was that Wise Acres, who provided the trail Magic this morning, also dropped in.  I was able to properly thank him this time around, and it was great to spend a few minutes with this truly kind individual.   


As it turns out , Wise Acres was not through being an Angel for me on this particular day.  I needed to run over to the local radio shack (yes, radio shacks still exist, who knew?) to get a charger compatible with the Anker battery I had purchased a couple days earlier (long, boring technical story).  It was a very manageable 20 minute walk, but WA insisted on giving me a ride.  He even hung out for the couple minutes I was in the store and then dropped me off at the grocery store.  


Wise Acres, if you happen to read this, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!


I’m made my quick swing through the grocery store and then walked the couple blocks back to the hostel.  Other familiar faces had arrived while I was gone, including Tank (Josai’s new trail name) and Elyise.  


While I would have loved to read one of the thousand books on Buddhism and other forms of earthy spirituality scattered throughout the house, I was pretty beat.  I uploaded a couple journal entries and tumbled off to sleep.  


Note: I often type much of these entries while on trail, but I tend to not edit them or upload them until I’m somewhere in the evening when I have Wi-Fi, battery, and personal energy to get them completed.   As such they are typically lagging by a few days.  It may be more than a few days when I head into the Smokies next week. 


On a personal sad note, I got some bummer news this morning. My college aged son was planning to join me for the week in the Smokies during his spring break next week.  Lots of logistics had been planned out to support his arrival, and I was super stoked to have him coming along for the adventure.  Unfortunately, he sprained his ankle yesterday playing basketball, and it’s a swollen black and blue mess.  Since the Smokies are not a section where you should be starting with a bum wheel, his part in the adventure must now be scrapped.  Bummed big time.","Rock Gap Shelter - Near Franklin NC

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660371,"I was up and shuffling around the hostel by 6:45 ish.  It’s always good to have a fresh brewed pot rather than the crystals I sprinkle into trail water.  Tank was also up, so we chatted for a bit while waiting for a shuttle to get rolling.  I also read a couple pages of the grandma Gatewood book, since it was sitting there on a shelf.  I may need to read that whole thing when I get back to the world.  


The shuttle process ended up being a bit of a mess. Zen the hostel owner was waiting for an electrical contractor to come to his house for an 8 o’clock appointment. Not surprisingly, the contractor did not show on time, so an alternate shuttle had to be arranged. It was a bit annoying because shuttle costs were supposed to be included in the room rate but we ended up paying marginally more money for a shuttle to get us back to winding stair gap. The shuttle driver was a really chill guy, and it resonated with me when he pointed out his window towards a scenic pull off on the highway and he referred to it as his “office”, where he could pick up cell service. It overlooked Albert Mountain to the west, not a bad view outside your office window.


After about an hour walk, I reached the grassy area known as Silers bald and I had arrived there at about the same time as stickers and deceiver and Kate. I was waffling about whether I was going to ascend the quarter-mile side trail that climbed the extra 250 feet elevation to the summit but ultimately I decided it might be worth it. Oh my gosh, yes it was worth it. Absolutely stunning views on a nice clear morning 360° off to the Smokies, back towards Albert mountain, and every which way. Sometimes you just need to take those blue blazed side trails. Throughout the day, there was a lot of nervous energy and discussion about next weeks trip through the Smokies. It is supposed to correspond with some colder weather and potentially some snow. So everybody is trying to figure out how they are going to arrange their days on and days off the trail to maximize hiking in good weather. I’m not sure any consensus was reached and of course forecasts a week away will change 10 times between now and then so I will certainly be playing it by ear, and paying attention to the various weather apps on my phone.At lunchtime, I had reached the open summit of way bald, which includes a lookout tower constructed from stone. I was able to enjoy the same conditions as earlier in the morning with nice blue skies affording views in every direction.   I even took time to peel off the backpack, and have a somewhat leisurely lunch on the summit, since I was not too worried about the mileage for that day. It was pretty addictive sitting there basking in the warm sunshine on a grassy surface. As frosting on the cake, there was even a well-maintained bathroom facility on this summit, since I believe it gets lots of tourist traffic during the summer. I and several others who had all arrived around the same time came and went throughout the lunchtime.  Finally it was time to pry myself away from the gorgeous views and head back down into the woods.


The rest of the afternoon was pretty uneventful, with some nice views through various breaks in the trees. I reached the cold spring shelter campsite area by about 430 or so and chose a nice spot on the ridge overlooking the valley below. I was able to enjoy both a fine sunset, and I believe I will get a nice sunrise from the same ridge tomorrow morning. At the shelter was navigator and daddy llama, however I believe some others might be coming up behind. The tenting area was about 1/10 of a mile past the shelter, so I did not go back to the shelter to socialize after I set up my tent. Up at the tenting area were myself, Captain Chaos, Moon Pants, and Socks. We all cooked up our meals had some nice conversation, hung our bag bear bags and called it a night by hiker midnight.","Franklin NC

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660410,"I woke up to a fantastic sunrise at Cold Spring.  The tent was perched on a sharp ridge that allowed me to see the light envelop the valley down below.   Moon Pants and Socks had asked me knock on their tent if they weren’t up for the sunrise, but they and Captain Chaos were also up enjoying the moment.  


Between the lingering a bit for sunrise, and thinking I had an easy day ahead, I took me a while to get breakfast and the morning breakdown completed.  I got on trail a bit before 8:30.  
Perhaps you noticed the foreshadowing in the prior paragraph, but it was NOT an easy day.  I tend to do better on days with a lot of uphill, but today was the opposite, a long grueling downhill into the Nantahala Outdoor Center.  For some reason, I just didn’t seem to have a ton of energy, and I dragged through the 11.5 mile day.   There were some pretty cool views down into the gorge, although it was honestly a bit disheartening, because I could see just how much elevation I needed to lose today.  I started the morning at 5000 feet, and NOC sits at 1800….long way down. 
I had been planning to stay at the Rufus Morgan shelter, which is about a mile short of the NOC, but based on the incoming storms for the night, and the attractiveness of the NOC, I decided to spring for a night in their Dogwood Motel.  I arrived into the NOC complex at about 2:00 and I had just enough energy to step into the general store and buy up some lunch items, and I plunked myself on a bench in the sun near the roaring river. 
For those who haven’t heard of the  NOC, it is one of the premier paddlesports destinations in the country.  A large number of the people who have worked there have competed in the Olympics in kayaking or canoeing.  It is a really cool setup, with all the infrastructure in place to support those who come to whitewater raft or kayak.  There is a permanent race course setup for kayaking.  I would love to go there one day and see some competition.  
I couldn’t check in until 3, so until then, I chowed some more food (ice cream sandwiches) browsed through the outfitter store, and grabbed a beer with Massachusetts and Stickers.  
I was also able to get my Smokies permit printed out.  Thru hikers need a permit to hike through GSMNP, which can be bought up to 30 days in advance.  I had bought mine online a couple days prior (their prices were doubling on March 1, so everybody was buying them at the end of Feb).  You actually need to carry a hard copy, however, and NOC is happy to print them out for you.  3:00 had arrived, so I got checked in.  The nasty surprise was that the motel portion of their property sits about 100 feet of elevation above the gorge, so my tired legs needed to schlep me and my pack up one more rise.
 I made a couple calls back home, and emptied my pack to get stuff into the free laundry.  Once again, a hot shower turned me into a new man.  Several of us had decided to meet back at the restaurant at 5:00 for dinner (hikers are like the elderly….early dinner time).  including Stickers, Deceiver and Kate, Massachusetts, Daddy Llama and Blacksburg, all had a great time plowing in pizza, salads, and other high calorie choices.   We were wrapped up by 6:30, and I made the climb back to the motel.  I caught up on some journaling uploads, and fought off sleep until the late late hour of 8:30.  Tomorrow I plan to tackle the biggest combined mileage and elevation day of the hike so far, so I’m hoping I’m feeling a bit stronger for that.","Cold Spring Shelter - NC

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660412,"A few of us hiking around each other for the past few days have talked about the feeling of being stuck in a “vortex” on these town days.  In other words, he creature comforts of normal civilization get pretty addictive pretty quick.  That was definitely the case this morning, when a hot cup of coffee and a comfortable sofa in the motel common room seemed to be beckoning to me.  I also had a minor amount of trepidation for the big day ahead….16 miles and 5700 feet of elevation gain.  But, I got myself up and out of the NOC, and got underway just before eight. The first couple hours were a long steady climb, and I felt fantastic. I partially attributed my power surge to a hostess double chocolate doughnut with caffeine. Nutrition of champions! I passed one really interesting spot shortly after leaving the gorge, where the shape of the rocks on the right side of the trail perfectly collected and reflected the sound of the river down below on the left side of the trail, so it sounded like I had rivers rushing on both sides of me. Natural stereophonic. The morning flew by and I took a quick break at a shelter about 8 miles up, where I ran into Captain Chaos. He had arrived into the NOC just before me yesterday afternoon but had decided to push on up to the next shelter rather than spending the night in the NOC. Apparently it was incredibly windy up on the ridge last night where he stayed; in fact he had to abandon his tent in the middle of the night and sleep at the feet of the other people in the shelter because his tent was falling apart. He had decided to take a zero that day at the shelter after such a crappy night sleep. He also indicated that there was a large bubble of people just ahead of us because his shelter was completely full with almost 15 people there last night. That became a topic of conversation with me and the others hiking around me as we were a bit surprised to hear if so many people seeking shelter space.  The day progressed on and I was in and out of showers all day long but nothing that caused too much problem.  The cloudy rainy weather dampened the distance of the available views, however there were some pretty cool scenes where clouds would get “trapped” down in the valleys and the puffy patches of clouds pockmarked the valleys below.    All day long I was doing mental math on when I might arrive at the shelter for the day. I use a formula of 3 mph +30 minutes for every 1000 feet of elevation. This helps me estimate potential arrival times and whether I’m having a fast day or a slow day. At one point, I felt like I was getting so focused on the numbers that I was about to start counting toothpicks on the floor after watching judge Wapner.   At those moments, I just try to ensure that I’m focusing on the natural beauty around me rather than getting to milepost X by a certain time.  Regardless, it ended up being a stellar day, and a I felt super strong throughout the whole hike.  I arrived at the Brown Fork shelter just after 3 o’clock, and honestly felt like I could have bitten off even more for the day.  Fortunately , the predicted mass of hikers did not materialize, so they must have either gotten off trail for a hostel night and/or pushed on to other locations.  There ended up being 6 of us in the shelter, Deciever and Kate, Stickers, and Moon Pants and Socks.  Everybody, including me, decided to use the shelter rather than tent due to the storms that were blowing through.  Bear bags were hung, and everyone shut down pretty quickly after a big mileage day.  The shelter did have a tin roof, so when the rain showers periodically arrived, it was pretty noisy, but eventually I drifted off to sleep.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660430,"After a night of the tinny pitter-pat of rain on the shelter roof, I woke up a bit groggy, but excited to get a relatively short day underway.  The goal for the day was to get down to the Fontana complex for my last night before entering the Smokies for several days.    
Fontana lake is formed by Fontana dam, which I believe they say is the tallest dam east of the Mississippi.   Like many dammed lakes, it provides food control, hydro power, and recreation opportunities.  The latter is good for me and the many through hikers, because the boating infrastructure that is in place means that there are stores which can provide resupply.  Also there is a visitor center by the dam, and whichever entity that is in charge of it (state? Federal? Army corps?) maintains a nice park there as well, and drum roll please….the nicest shelter on the entire AT. The Fontana shelter is lovingly referred to as the “Fontana Hilton” by hikers.  It is a massive double-decker, with a solar recharging station, pumped water, picnic tables, and get this: a heated bathhouse with a shower! All of it sits right next to the lake in a picturesque flat grassy setting.  Unfortunately the only downside is that the day required another massive loss of elevation, since the lake sits at 1800 feet.  Oh well, it’s the price of admission I guess. The weather forecast was looking a bit sketchy for the day: the Smoky Mountain agency had emailed a high wind and damaging rain advisory, and all the weather apps were calling for some pretty serious stuff in the late afternoon.  As such, I wanted to hustle and get down to Fontana in good haste.   Breakfast was eaten and stuff packed up by 7:45 and I hit the trail.   Right at the junction for the shelter spur trail and the AT itself, I ran into Daddy Llama who had spent the night at a hostel and had been shuttled back to the trail a couple miles back earlier in the morning.  Our mini-bubble of people all headed out and made pretty good time all morning.    The wind field ahead of the storm front arrived by mid morning, and any time the trail followed along a ridge line, there was some pretty impressive creaking and groaning in the trees up above.  I have to admit that I did keep one eye cocked upwards for a while there.   Eventually as I descended from the ridge a bit, things settled down, and it was a reasonably pleasant hike downward.   Eventually I got low enough and close enough that I could start seeing the dam and the lake.   The dam is a pretty impressive structure.   You could hear the water tumbling over the spillways from a long ways away. It was also interesting how low the lake was. It was probably at least 20 feet down from what would seem to be normal levels, meaning that there was a lot of normally submerged shoreline that was visible today.  I at first wondered if there was a drought in the area, but I later found out that it’s just seasonal; the dam operators draw the water level down in the winter to help maintain water quality.  Apparently by Memorial Day it will be right back to full pool.   It makes me thankful that the lake my family and I visit regularly which is also dammed,  is regulated differently, and the water must be maintained at plus or minus a few inches of normal level unless there is a severe water emergency.  Finally I reached lake level at 1:00.  the trail route passes right be the marina that serves the Fontana Lake Resort, and at this time of year they have the marina stocked with all the typical staples that hikers need for resupply.   Since I have a major section upcoming with no easy resupply opportunity,  I went to work loading up my backpack with six days of food.   They also had a microwave and some frozen foods, so I had a mid afternoon snack of a hot pocket (please use your Jim gaffigan voice when reading that) and a bacon egg and cheese biscuit.  125 bucks later, and I had my resupply.   That marina must be absolutely hopping during the height of the summer boating season, since they are the only game in town.  The guy managing the place was super friendly, and there was a sign prompting you to ask him for the joke of the day and you got a free popsicle.   Somebody did ask for the joke, but I can’t remember what it was…it was pretty corny though.  But who am I to pass judgement with the liberal sprinkling of Dad jokes in this journal.   When I got outside to start the mile walk over to the shelter, I could tell I was going to get wet.   Another massive wind had kicked up, and this time it had the rain clouds to go with it.  Sure enough, I made it about halfway to the shelter and got a well needed shower after a sweaty couple days on trail.   Once arriving to the shelter a great evening commenced.   As mentioned, it’s a huge place that can sleep 24, and there only ended up being 8 of there.  RNTUL, Unicorn, Stickers, Deveiver and Kate, Navigator, and Hold Fast.  I went over to the washroom to plug in my phone and RNTUL was there was well recharging the collection of electronics that he carries to feed his YouTube channel. He gladly made space for my phone, and we hung out in the heated bathroom chatting while they recharged. Yeah “hung out in the bathroom” is a pretty creepy thing to type, but it seemed normal at the time.  While we were in there, the main line of thunderstorms came through and dropped impressive amounts of rain.  The lake was only about 50 feet away, but it couldn’t be seen through the rain.  Fortunately, it was a pretty narrow band of storms and pushed through quite rapidly.   Behind the front everything cleared out, and we ended up having a beautiful sunset over the lake later on.  I spent the evening getting all my food repacked into manageable spots in my backpack, eating dinner, and catching up on communications. There was lot of chatter in the shelter about the attack plan for the Smokies; which shelter on which day, etc.   We have a window of three good days of weather, and then it gets hit or miss after that.  There is only one main spot to bail out of the Smokies, at Newfound Gap where a highway leads down into Gatlinburg.  I am not planning to go there, but if the weather deteriorates too badly, it’s an option.  Deciever and Kate have family in Gatlinburg and are planning to zero there on either Tuesday or Wednesday.   Anyway, like many other times on the trail, it’s best to do a moderate amount of planning, with a heavy dose of “we will take it as it comes”. Currently I’m planning for tomorrow to be either a 15 mile day or an 18 mile day, both with thousands of feet of elevation gain.   We will see how my legs feel at the 15 mile shelter, and make the call then.","Brown Fork Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660633,"Day 1 of the Smokies!  After the spectacular setting at Fontana, I was jazzed to get started into the section many of had been discussing for days.  While I was still a bit bummed that my son would not be able to join for the section as originally planned, I was nonetheless ready to get rolling into the famous stretch.  I got out of the shelter relatively early and was walking across the dam by 7:30. I stopped to take a few pictures along the top of that beast, and then followed the paved road around the corner and into the woods.  I reached the boundary where you have to deposit half of your printed permit at the exact time a ridge runner was emptying out the pile of permits from the previous day.  We chatted for a couple moments, and got the obligatory Leave No Trace speech, and then he set off at a much quicker pace than I would ever match.  Of course I realized just after he departed that I had failed to follow the permit instructions (that are simple enough for a six year old) and had filled out the wrong half of the permit.  I made the executive decision to put the wrong half in the box and deal with any fallout later (I’m not expecting any).
Navigator and I were hiking together for a while during this section, and I took the opportunity to get to know him a bit better.  He lives in Moscow Russia, and is in the States solely to hike the AT.  He came over last year and did the first 650 miles and decided he wanted to do the whole thing.  His visa interview for this trip was four days after the Ukraine war started, so he was a bit worried, but eventually had no problems getting the visa.  I am all for it. The more that we can have simple things like a hiking trip allowed to happen, perhaps the more commonality and ties we can get between our two countries that are often at odds.   He is also an interesting dude: he played poker professionally for most of the past decade or so, and pretty much lives off the investments he was able to buy with his winnings.  He is a pretty soft spoken and relaxed guy, and I’m glad that we were able to get the chance to do some hiking together.The ascent out of Fontana was steady and relentless, but I felt really strong, and the picture perfect hiking weather helped as well.  We were soon passing some of the early milestones for the day, and the views through the trees into the surrounding mountains was wonderful.   It’s very easy to see why the Smokies are high in the lists of most-visited National Parks.   For the last few miles of the day’s hike, I was hanging out with Daddy Llama, who had stayed at a hostel the night before, and had a 45 minute or so head start earlier in the morning.  By 3:00, I had reached the Spence Field shelter, my intended destination for the night.
I had just completed an 18 mile day, with 5700 ft if elevation, and I felt fantastic.  It still surprises me how some days you are on your game, and other days not so much.  Today I felt like I absolutely crushed those miles.  We shall see how tomorrow feels.
The shelter would also be home to Daddy Llama, Navigator, Stickers, and RNTUL and Unicorn for the night, as we all arrived within a half hour of each other. Interestingly, when I arrived there were half a dozen backpacks and a yard-sale of sleeping bags and other items scattered through the shelter.  Apparently some weekend hikers had stashed their stuff there and were out exploring other trails and peaks.  I set up my tent, which I prefer to shelter-dwelling most nights anyway.  The ridge runner also arrived soon after and we ended up cooking our dinners together and having good conversation.  He is also a raft guide based out of Hot  Springs. Also dining at the same time was a guy out doing a massive day hike. He apparently is trying to complete some sort of Smokies 850 mile challenge, and that day he came come up from Fontana on some different trails and was planning to hike out that evening.  He still had another 14 miles to go after dinner.  It was going to be a 30 mile or so day for him.  Oh, and he works at a nearby nuclear research facility, so he has few things going on In his life.  The backpack owners came back while we were eating, and the ridge runner admonished them that leaving their stuff like that was a bit of a no-no; too much of an attraction for bears and other critters.Even though I felt like I had a strong day, I was pretty much ready for bed by 6:30, and after a couple journaling items and quick communications, it was lights out.","Fontana Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660634,"I was up and getting breakfast relatively early.  While I had started the hike with making a hot breakfast almost every morning, I am now doing cold most mornings to save time, fuel, and the hassle of breaking out the cookware. Soon I was out of camp and ascending the rough terrain. Navigator had mentioned that his memory from last year was that todays section was the most difficult , and he proved to be correct.  The rough terrain combined with a sluggishness in my legs , and it was slow going all day. At least I was rewarded with some great views, especially early in the morning, when the angle of the sun really created some sharp contrasts in the ridges, peaks, and valleys. I wish I was a better photographer to really be able to capture how the Smokies look at that time of day. 
It had also gotten well below freezing last night, and there were some really cool frost formations alongside the trail. Overall, while the sights and sounds of the Smokies were just as fantastic as the prior day, the rough terrain, and my low stamina on this day, just made it an absolute STRUGGLE. Most of my other fellow hikers were having the same kind of day, and Daddy Llama put it well when he said “yesterdays 18 miles felt like 13, Ana todays 13 felt like 18”.  
The evening also felt like a bit of a goodbye.  Stickers had decided to push on for a 20 mile day, so he was not at the shelter. Navigator, Daddy Llama, RNTUL and Unicorn, and Deceiver and Pace are all having a short day tomorrow to get off trail at Newfound Gap to resupply in Gatlinburg. I have plenty of food, so I am continuing on with bigger miles tomorrow.  It’s kind of the nature of the hike: an amorphous group of people combine, separate and recombine at various stops along the way.  I’m pretty sure I’ll see several if not all of these folks in coming days on trail, but you never know for sure.  
After loading up on a ton of calories, and doing a fair amount of stretching, it was time to shut down for the night.","Spence Field Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660635,"It was an eventful day!  I rolled out of camp at 7:30, and was happy that my legs felt like they had returned to full strength, and the terrain was easier, so it felt like I was absolutely flying down the trail this morning.  The reward for my first hour of work: Standing on top of Clingmans Dome tower, the highest point on the AT!  At 6400-ish feet in elevation, you can see forever and a day.  Decades ago they built a concrete tower with a winding spiral ramp to the top. I’m not sure I agree with the aesthetics of such a structure in a forest setting, but either way, it gets you above the treetops and rewards you with that view.  I have been so lucky to get good weather for at least the first three days in the Smokies, and the clear morning afforded me sights for miles and miles.  While I was on the tower, I chatted with a guy from North Georgia who had biked up the access road to Clingmans Dome. Nice guy, but the unbelievable thing to me was his best friend was from my little hometown in Maine. He even knew of the Rambler mascot of my high school, which is the genesis of my trail name. Very small world, indeed. Somewhere during the morning trot, I also passed through the 200 mile mark of the AT.  Gotta love checking off big round numbers! Shortly after, I was at Newfound Gap, and I saw my first sign showing that Katahdin was less than 2000 miles away.  That’s pretty cool. Newfound Gap was teeming with dozens of tourists, which was surprising, since it was a Monday of a non-holiday week.  That gap is a popular launching point for day hikes in the Smokies, and I think people also just go there for a picnic.  Shortly after I arrived at newfound gap, Navigator, Daddy Llama, RNTUL, and Unicorn all arrived and all quickly secured rides down to Gatlinburg.  Deceiver and Pace were also sitting at the gap, spread out on their foam mats, eating some lunch. They were waiting for Pace’s family to come and pick them up to enjoy two zero days somewhere in the Gatlinburg area. They have been a joy to be around for the last week or so, and hopefully our paths will cross perhaps even as soon as Hot Springs late next week. One thing that was also nice about the day, was that virtually all of the hiking had now entered a spruce forest, as opposed to the hardwood forest that had dominated the first 2+ weeks of my hike. There is something quiet and peaceful about being in those softwood forest environments. Perhaps it is the spruce needles that carpet the ground and make a walking a little bit quieter compared to the rustling of fallen leaves under foot. I had a quick bite to eat with deceiver and Pace, and then packed up and headed on my way, since I still had big miles to do that afternoon. The first couple hours out of the gap were quite active with day hikers. Lots of college age kids and a few others as well. I am actually quite happy to see the college kids out enjoying this type of spring break, in my opinion much better than sitting around drinking on the gulf coast or something similar. The next big landmark of the day was Charlie’s Bunion. This rocky outcropping is quite famous in the Smokies and is a popular day hike destination from Newfound gap. Along the way, I also experienced a small dose of trail magic. Four ladies who were out hiking together came upon me, and the first of them said “are you a thru hiker, do you want some trail magic,?” and she proceeded to pull out apples and oranges. Fresh fruit! That is a huge win on the trail.  Freshly energized by the juicy sweetness of the apple, I continued my rapid pace up the trail. When I reached Charlie’s Bunion fortunately there were not too many people there, maybe just five or six. There was a young couple sitting together enjoying a snack on the most prominent rocky outcropping, and the young lady was nice enough to quickly offer me her spot to come up there and enjoy the view.  Very courteous!  I took some time to snap a few pictures, and then quickly headed on down the trail.  The rest of the gorgeous afternoon continued to offer fine views of the ridge tops, but I also had to stay somewhat focused on completing my longest day on trail yet.  Finally, around 6 o’clock I finally reached the shelter completing a 21 mile a day. There was a small group of college kids from Michigan who had set up tents, and four through hikers down in the shelter. Scout, Honey Badger, Michelle, and Chief.  I quickly cooked up my meal and chatted with the four folks for a bit and then it was time to put my tired body down for the night. A very memorable day on trail.","Double Spring Shelter
",Pecks Corner Shelter,"Mar 06, Mon",21
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660636,"Today was one of my most relaxing days on trail this far.  I knew that I had only planned a relatively short 13.3 miles for the day, not knowing how my body might respond after yesterday’s 21 mile pounding. I took my time with my morning routine, including a bit of extra time for stretching.   By the time I finally hit trail, it was just after 8:30.  I also worried, that despite a favorable forecast, the trail was socked in with fog, the temps were just above freezing, and the wind was howling. I layered up, and headed down the trail. It was pretty chilly walking for about the first hour and a half, however the forecasters were eventually correct as whatever was going on that morning finally dissipated. The sun burned off the clouds, and a fantastic day laid out in front of me. Three or four times during the morning‘s walk, I decided to pull off to the side of the trail and sit in a nice sunny grassy spot and just relax for 10 or 15 minutes. This might not sound particularly momentous, however I usually just keep walking all day and don’t really take very many stops. Fortunately these sunny spots also corresponded with good cell coverage, and I was able to check in with family members back home. It was refreshing to briefly catch up and hear how things are going down at the beach. I also took the opportunity to make my reservations for Hot Springs North Carolina where I will take my first zero mileage day of this trip on Saturday. My son will also be driving to Hot Springs to join me for the day, and bring some supplies that were originally going to come to Fontana when he was going to join me in the Smokies.  It was a bit amusing to me when my wife asked where I was, and I really couldn’t even pin down the state.  This section of the AT zigzags back and forth across the North Carolina and Tennessee border, so at any point of the day I really don’t know what state I am in. I know I am in the Smokies, I know I am on the AT, I know I’m about 2000 miles from katahdin, but beyond that I’m not quite sure. I crossed paths with a guy out for a day hike this morning: just a little 40 miler that he had started at 3 o’clock in the morning. He was an AT through-hiker in 2017 and now enjoys going on challenging day hikes. Impressive. Today’s music that was stuck in my head included Cecila by Simon and Garfunkel, and Ramblin Man (I can’t imagine how that one snuck into my head). I’m still open for suggestions. The day continued at its relatively relaxed pace, and I got to the shelter at 3:30.  Chief, Michelle, Scout, and Honey Badger are my shelter mates for the second straight night.  Michelle is a lady about my age who is also from MA, Chief is retired Navy and retired Sheriff from FL, Scout from Dallas is taking a break after his first semester in college, and Honey Badger is young feee spirit dude from FL.  All are good folks and we shared some good laughs over our ramen and other freeze dried meals.  A blood red full moon rose on a cloudless night just before hiker midnight, and once again I wished I was a better photographer in order to capture the deep color that was piercing the black sky. A howling coyote somewhere close by said goodnight to me at about 8:30.  Enough said.","Pecks Corner Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660638,"My Smokies permit apparently included a two-for-one double feature for rising celestial bodies at Crosby Knob Shelter, because I was treated to an orange and red sunrise that competed with last night’s moonrise for Best Mountainous Cinematography, Appalachian Trail Category. We shall wait and see how the academy votes. Today was to be my last day in the Smokies, which would close the curtain on a section that I had been both looking forward to, but which had also gotten into my head a little bit. The high elevation of the range at this time of year brings heightened chances for adverse cold wet weather and the resulting g dangerous conditions. Fortunately, I hit the section at just about the perfect time whether wise.  Not of drop of precipitation, and only a couple nights that were moderately below freezing. The day started with a quick descent from Crosby knob, and then a steady climb to the top of Mount Camerer which had fine views in several directions.  Unfortunately then came my least favorite type of stretch, a 6 mile 3700 foot descent down into Davenport gap. While considerable portions of the descent had good footing, the constant down down down just pounds my knees and feet into submission after a while and I end up taking frequent breaks to give them a rest.  Down in the gap, I encountered the pigeon River which collects all of the water that was flowing into those nice springs and streams that filled my water bottles for the last 75 miles and turns them into an impressive river full of rapids and falls. Shortly after the river I crossed under interstate 40, a major east-west highway across the United States. I haven’t looked to see when the next even numbered interstate is on the radar screen that we will cross (is there a 42?). Since I had really good cell coverage along the busy highway I made a couple calls to connect with family. I then set off in search of the fabled Standing Bear hostel. A quick side note: I believe that in an earlier post, I mentioned that Benton Mckaye was considered the founding father of the AT, and did tremendous work to get the trail almost brought to fruition in the 20’s and 30’s.  He was also a bit of a, shall we say, idealist.  His idea of the trail included communes spaced every so many miles, where people would gather, unite as one cooperative entity working for peace and harmony in the universe.  Yeah, not surprisingly it was his focus on this aspect of the trail that left him as sort of an “idea guy” (let’s feed mayonnaise to the tuna fish!) in need of some other folks with more practical skills like land acquisition and construction to actually finally make the trail a reality.  I provide the above long winded aside because the Standing Bear Hostel is exactly the kind of place that Mackaye would have loved.  This trippy little corner of TN (yes apparently I crossed into TN again this morning) has bunkhouse, treehouses, and river houses, along with communal fire pits / music circles, and eclectic art scattered everywhere in sort of a hippie meets hillbilly kind of vibe.  I might sound like I’m down on the place, but I’m really not….it just occupies a very unique niche in the hiker culture.  I was greeted by a couple guys trading labor for a place to sleep; and by labor I mean they washed the dishes for ten minutes then played guitar for 20 minutes then moved a pot from one corner of the grounds to other then ate a pizza for 20 minutes.  But I digress. The folks running the place were very kind and welcoming souls, and I quickly had had selected a number of items to purchase from their resupply stock. I also popped a frozen pizza in the communal oven, and had a quick lunch with Scout, Cheif,and Michelle, who had also arrived at roughly the same time.  After finishing the pizza and cold drinks and lingering for about an hour, it was time to push on with the day.  I had to chuckle a bit when just before I departed, Popcorn and Cup of Tea arrived to spend the night.  Cup of Tea is a retired career Army officer from the UK and seems quite squared away, as you might imagine.  I will be interested to hear her take on the place when I next see her on trail.  Honey Badger, who I had not seen since I left the shelter this morning, was also planning to spend the night there.  As much of a free spirit as he seems to be…he might never leave.  Of course since I had spent the morning descending 3700 feet into a gap, it was time to climb.  Believe it or not, my body very much welcomed going up instead of down, and it was a pleasant climb out.  I eventually submitted Snowbird Mountain which has a strange UFO-looking building perched on top. I will be sure to go back and look closely at the photos to see if there were any little green men milling around.   After Snowbird peak, it was a pretty uneventful next couple hours. I descended 1200 feet to ground hog Creek shelter where I would spend my evening. When I arrived, there were already a few people there at the shelter and also coming along were Chief, Scout and Michelle from last night’s shelter gang. As a nice surprise the folks who were already at the shelter had a really nice fire going. Since I do not usually have campfires at the places I tent, it was a nice reminder of how relaxing a campfire can be.  Tonight‘s shelter gang included Pat, a retired Ohio state trooper who is doing the through hike but perhaps not enjoying it and maybe deciding to leave the trail, and also Pats cousin. Also there was an ex military thru hiker whose name I didn’t catch, and another gentleman who was retired British military and British police force.  With that many ex military and ex-policing individuals gathered around the dinner table, there was of course lots of war stories back-and-forth dominated by the military types. With nothing to add war-story wise, I was able to just shut up and melt into the background a little bit and just enjoy the fire. Soon it was time to shut down and hiker midnight was on us","Crosby Knob Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660666,"I have to admit, for most of today my mind really wasn’t on today’s hike, but rather what Friday, Saturday and Sunday were going to bring. I am going to be arriving in to Hot Springs North Carolina on Friday around noon time and spending both Friday night and Saturday night there. My son is also going to come and join me for Saturday. There is also inclement weather coming starting tonight and continuing into Friday morning. Saturday is supposed to be beautiful and Sunday returns to rain. Of course Saturday is the day that I was going to take my 0 mile day and just relax in hot springs.  But with the weather pattern, I am now trying to figure how I can get in some miles during the good weather and minimize my time in the bad.  Hopefully by the time Friday night rolls around, I will have it figured out.  The hike itself today featured a pretty steady climb up away from last night’s shelter site, and eventually put me on top of Max Patch, which was a really cool grass-topped mountain about 4600 feet high.  There is quite a network of trails around Max Patch, and I believe it’s probably quite a popular day hiking destination.  Normally people are allowed to camp up there, but the forest service has closed it to camping for a couple years to allow the grounds to heal, after it became a bit TOO popular for its own sustainable health.  With the bald top combined with the good weather today, I had another fantastic opportunity to survey the surrounding mountains. I hit the summit at roughly the same time as Chief and Michelle, and we took the opportunity to relax In the sun-warmed grass at the peak for a bit. There was a thru hiker, Poppins, who was hiking with her poodle also at the top.  I liked her attitude…she was well into her 70’s and self-declared as a very slow hiker, but said “I like it that way, because I get to meet all the  Northbound hikers who pass me”.  Have a great hike, Poppins! Chief and Michelle have their respective spouses coming into Hot Springs for the weekend and they were renting an AirBnB to relax for a couple days, so other than running into them in town, I’ll probably not see them much for a while since I’m pulling out of town a day earlier than them.  I descended down off Max Patch, and followed several mountain streams downward into Lemon Gap. I was a bit torn about where I wanted to bed down for the night, but I ultimately decided that I wanted to get a lot of miles behind me this afternoon, and leave only a small jaunt into Hot Springs remaining for a rainy Friday morning.  I ended up finding a small stealth spot next to a waterfall. My tent was perched on a bit of a cliff, so I needed to remind myself not to step outside the tent in the  middle of the night and go for unexpectedly large step downwards.    I got the tent set up, and some trail food into my belly.  I will definitely be ready to load up on town food in HS for the next couple days.  I see green, fresh sustenance in my immediate future.  I drifted off to sleep with stalks of broccoli dancing in my head.","Groundhog Creek Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660668,"Hot springs is calling my name!   It was a rainy night last night, but nothing too serious that kept me awake.  I successfully stayed away from the cliffs edge in my tentsite and lived to type out another riveting episode of Rambler Walks Slowly North.  My bear bag also survived the night, so either the bears are just not around yet, or my fabulous outdoorsman skills are frustrating the hell out of them.  As it turns out, my stealth site was even more stealthy than expected.  As mentioned in the prior post, it was situated in a spot next to waterfall, and quite visible from the trail.  I had dawdled a bit this morning because when I awoke a bit before 6:00, the weather apps were predicting that the rain would end by 8:00am. I only had about 8 miles left to get into town, so I figured I could chill in my tent for an extra hour or so than normal and still be in town well before noon. Then the refreshed weather apps said 8:15 rain ending. Then 9:00.  Clearly the bots that run those apps are the same ones that tell you your plane is going to be delayed 30 minutes. Then 60, then 90.  Anyway, I decided to go ahead and pack up while it was still raining, and I was just about finished, when I saw chief and Michelle both coming down the trail to the water crossing (they had camped a few miles back last night).   They actually stopped to fill water bottles and were there for at least five minutes and did not see me 30 feet away. I had to laugh.  I didn’t want to shout over the roar of the falls and scare the crap out of them, so I finally walked up.  They were pretty surprised that they were that close and had not seen me.  The three of us walked together for a while, but I eventually decided to head off at a it quicker pace to get my town day started early.  It was still pretty dense patchy fog, and there was a cool eerie quality to the morning walk.  There were a couple spots on the tops of knobs, where the lichen growing in the exposed rock seemed to be actually glowing. I assume the glowing was just the interplay of the weird foggy lighting and the rock, and that there wasn’t some horrible radioactive isotope fueling a zombie horde on the other side of the knob. I arrived into HS at 10:30 and immediately liked what I saw.  The hostel where I was going to stay is literally adjacent to the trail, and had a really cool setup.  Laughing Heart Hostel has both a hostel, a lodge, and an event space on the property.  This time of year, mostly just the hostel was busy.  It was clean, welcoming, and convenient to town. BTW, this morning’s walking song was “Oooh That Smell” by Lynrd Skynnrd.  When that becomes the song in your head, you know it’s time for your first shower in about a week, and that was definitely the first order of business once I got checked in.  OMG, that shower water felt awesome.  Modern creature comforts.  The hiking clothes were chucked into the laundry and I chose a nice fitting set of loaner clothes from the pile while mine de-funkified. While I was standing outside the hostel, I heard my name being called, and coming down the trail were Daddy Llama and Navigator.  I figured that I would probably see them soon, since they had only gone down into Gatlinburg a few days back for resupply and were not planning to spend any down time there. They are both strong hikers, and I assumed they would soon catch up. We chatted for a bit, and made plans to meet for lunch at a diner down the street.  I finished getting the wet stuff out of my backpack so that it could start drying, and then headed over to Smoky Mountain Diner. Actually, just before leaving for the diner, I stepped on the scale at the hostel, and found that I was now down almost 20 pounds since getting on trail 21 days ago.  Again, I’m expecting to lose some, but I want to slow the pace a bit….time to put on the feed bag.  A massive salad and a massive burger were ordered and consumed, along with a lot of liquid.  It was great to catch up with DL and Nav and hear how their past few days had gone since I last saw them.  They were generally only 6 to 10 miles behind me at any given time.  Just as we were finishing, RNTUL and Unicorn came in, having also now caught up after their Gatlinburg resupply.   We hung out for a bit longer while they ate, and then Chief, Scout, Michelle, all arrived as well.  At one point I think I counted about 15 through hikers in the place.  After finishing up, I wandered down the block to the local outfitter. This weekend has some significant gear changeover occurring in my pack and on my feet.   My son is bringing my lighter sleeping bag, as the 20 degree bag I’m carrying has just been overkill. It is supposed to get cold for a couple days later this coming week, but it’s time to trade a couple nights of possible discomfort for a lighter and more compact kit.  I did decide to buy a bag liner at the outfitter to add some comfort and a bit of warmth to my 35 degree bag.  I have never bothered with a liner before, so I guess I will be testing this setup on the fly.  As planned, I’m also switching from boots to trail runners. I was already planning to retire my fairly heavy duty gaiters that I wear with my boots in favor of a lighter weight version (“dirty girl” is a widely available brand of the lightweight type), and coincidentally my heavier gaiters sustained a broken clasp the day before arriving in HS, so the timing was good.  I headed back to the hostel after my outfitters visit to relax for a bit and let the heavy food digest.  I also used the time to figure out the plan of attack for mileage over the next couple days.  Since my son is not going to arrive into HS until noonish tomorrow, I am going to get a ride out to Hurricane Gap on Saturday morning after breakfast, which is about 10 trail miles north of town.  I will then walk the 10 miles back to town and arrive about the same time as my son. I will be doing this with a very light pack (“slackpacking”) since I can leave most everything back at the hostel.  After getting that plan sorted I made a few calls back home to check in and get caught up.  A fire had been started in the outdoor fire pit, so I was able to enjoy an afternoon fire while making my calls.  A number of us decided to meet at Iron Horse station for dinner, and soon I was in a throng of hikers scattered around tables loading in more calories.  The food was surprisingly good…a nice red snapper dish, with a side of seasoned, but not dancing, broccoli. After dinner and a beer and terrorizing the town until the ridiculously late hour of 7:15, it was time to get back to the hostel, catch up on some journal uploads and get some much needed rest in a bed with a mattress.","Waterfall Tentsite

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660759,"The plan for the day: get up and join Cup of Tea, Scout, Chief and spouse, and Michelle and spouse for breakfast at Smoky Mountain Diner; then ride with that crew out to Hurricane Gap.They were planning to spot a car there, as HG was going to be their finish line for a northbound walk out of HS, whereas my plan was to hike southbound back into town,  because that timing would work better for meeting up with my son when he arrived to town.     Breakfast was fantastic, with the ladies at the diner doing a great job taking care of us, and loading me down with breakfast biscuits and pancakes, and their Saturday special- cinnamon rolls.  Giddy up!  The ride out to Hurricane Gap took maybe 20 minutes and I got a chance to chat with Michelle’s husband Jim for a while.  He and Michelle do a ton of hiking in New England and they have competed the 100 highest list. I have done the 48 NH 4000 footers, and a bunch of others, but I never took the time to try to bag the full 100H list.   Good job by them! We found the trail crossing in good haste, and I was off on my southbound hike.  It was a beautiful morning, and with a pack that probably weighed less than 10 pounds, it felt like I was flying down the trail. The only thing that slowed me down was that every 15 minutes or so, I would run into one of my fellow northbounders going the correct direction, and I would stop to chat for a couple minutes.  Daddy Llama, Navigator, RNTUL and Unicorn all headed out that morning, and then of course as I got closer to town , Chief, Scout, Michelle, Cup of Tea and spouses were out doing their northbound trek.  It was quite an attractive stretch of trail, and as I got closer to HS and the French Broad river that runs through town, I encountered quite a few day hikers out climbing into the hills for the spectacular view down into the river gorge.  There was one cliff labeled “lovers leap”…to the best of my knowledge there were no jumpers on this particular day.  When I arrived back in town I was greeted by my son who arrived via car a few minutes before me.  It was great to see him, and we headed up to hostel so that I could take a quick shower and get Jason checked into his room before grabbing a bite to eat.   We landed at the Big Pillow Brewing and Taqueria, and had a fantastic time eating their tasty food and sampling a couple of their brewed specialities.  They had an outdoor seating area with probably 20 picnic tables, and the place was bustling with scores of people enjoying a sunny Saturday afternoon in Hot Springs.  We then wandered back down the river so that Jason could take a look, and we were impressed by the volume of water coming over the rapids.  I think there has plenty of rain and snow to fuel the local rivers this year.  Eventually we went back to the hostel, and I got my gear and food sorted out.   I grabbed just enough food to keep me fueled for the next few days, and sent the rest back so that Jason and his hungry college roommates could devour the remainder.  I also completed my long awaited gear cutover: 20 degree sleeping bag was traded out for my 35 degree, and boots traded for trail runners.  Jason  now has the pleasure of driving around with my nasty boots in the back of his car, however there was already a pair of his nasty boots and a foot-deep pile of “stuff” in his vehicle, so I guess the impact of my boots to the cumulative effect is probably pretty minimal.  We chilled out at the hostel for a while longer, but close to four hours had elapsed since the last gorging of town food, so it was off to Iron Horse Station for a second night of good food and drink. There was of course other through hikers in there, so the camaraderie was high.  Unfortunately for Jason, I was still on hiker time, not college time, and it was time for me to shut down at 8:30 or so.  A really enjoyable day, and I’m super grateful that Jason was there to spend it with me.","Laughing Heart Hostel

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660761,"The plan for Jason’s last hours with me was to have one more dose of town food with a big hearty breakfast at the Smoky Mountain Diner, and then he would drive me out to Hurricane Gap and I could resume my northbound trek.  Unfortunately the first part of that plan had a bit of snag: it was Sunday in the South, and diners like that are not open.  So we pivoted to plan B; after checking out of Laughing Heart, we stopped at the Hillbilly Market, and selected some breakfast sandwiches and a couple other items and then we were on our way. BTW, the prior sentence was not a derogatory comment, the name of the store was actually Hillbilly Market.  It had started raining overnight and had turned quite a bit cooler as well.  It was still above freezing in Hot Springs, at elevation 1300 feet, but I wondered what was going to await me up at Hurricane Gap (elevation 3000) and beyond.  The answer was “a cold, windy icy mess”.  After saying goodbye to Jason, I set off into a 30mph gale blowing freezing air and mist/rain onto the ridge.  The stage was set of a morning of freezing rain.   Running shorts on, and rain jacket hood up, I trudged up the ridge quickly gaining 500 feet in the first mile or so.  At this point I encountered the Spring Mountain Shelter, and four cold, wet, miserable people.   The four hikers — Poppins, Jeff (not me), and two others - had spent the prior night there.  It was not raining when they arrived, but in the middle of the night the rain and wind had picked up and the shelter was oriented in the worst possible direction such that the open end of the shelter faced right into the wind.  So the wind blew all the rain right into them all night and most of them had very wet sleeping bags, which does terrible things to their insulating capabilities. Poppins indicated that she and her dog are going to get off trail for the day at the first possible road crossing; Jeff was getting ready to head northbound shortly, and I’m not sure what the other two were doing.  I only lingered for a minute or two, because standing still was not a recipe for staying warm.  As I pushed on up into the >4000’ hills, the icing intensified.  For the first time on this hike, it was time to trade the running shorts for long hiking pants.   Throughout the morning and afternoon, I was getting pelted with ice tubes.  “What’s an ice tube?” you ask….let me tell you.  As the rain, or even just the wet fog passes through the trees, it builds up on all the limbs and branches.  At some point the branches sag, and the “tube” of ice slides off the end of the branch and falls to the ground.  If there is some hiker dumb enough to be walking along when this happens, the ice tubes initiate their radar, fire their thrusters, and aim for any exposed part of the hiker’s head, face or neck.   The technology is really quite advanced.  And when a strong blast of wind happens to blow through the trees, thousands of those suckers are able to launch at once in a coordinated air assault.  Luke Skywalker would not have stood a chance against these Death Star defenders.  Yet onward I went.  Finally my forward progress ended at Jerry Cabin Shelter.  I quickly got some hot food cooked up and warmed myself from the inside out.  I also made the decision to sleep in the shelter rather than my normally preferred tent. It was supposed to continue raining that night, and I didn’t want to deal with packing up a wet tent in the morning. This shelter was also facing the correct direction, and was a lot deeper the shelter I encountered earlier in the day, so my confidence was fairly high that shelter dwelling would be an acceptably dry choice. RNTUL and Unicorn arrived, chatted for a few minutes and decided to push on to a tenting site a few miles ahead since they only had 10 miles under their belt so far that day.  Four other hikers arrived over the course of the next couple hours; AOG and Mule - retired work buddies from CT who are hiking together, Jeff (the wet sleeping bag guy) who is a recently retired guy from FL, and a fourth whose name I did not catch.  AOG, Mule, and the last guy all decided to tent, while Jeff decided to join me in the shelter.  Soon everyone had cooked and consumed their foods, and we all found suitable bear hang sites, since the bear cables at this site were a tangled inoperative mess. I hung out in my sleeping bag and chatted for a while while the others ate, and was pleased that I felt plenty warm while in this lighter weight bag.  I’m hoping it stays that way throughout the night.","Hurricane Gap

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660762,"When I awoke at Jerry’s Cabin Shelter a bit before sunrise, it was still quite foggy.  In the pre-dawn low light I squinted out the shelter opening, and thought “gosh, this fog really seems to make the ground look white-ish”.  Moments later as I exited my warm sleeping bag and stepped out of the shelter to go fetch my food bag, I thought “I sure don’t remember this dirt trail being so white and crunchy last night”.  And yes, even without the aid of caffeine, I finally realized that the precipitation had changed overnight, and we now had an inch layer of some kind of snow/ice concoction.   Yeehaw.  As I fetched my food bag from the bear hang, I also had a nice surprise: the overnight ice had effectively welded my rope and my food bag to the branches.  After some determined tugging and yanking with my now-freezing hands, I was able to free it from its temporary prison.  A couple other guys weren’t quite as lucky.  They had used the PCT hang method (google it) and it took them three people with multiple improvised tools about a half hour to get their bags out of the trees.   I mentioned a few entries ago that I had largely stopped eating hot breakfasts in favor of just cereal bars or pop tarts or some such thing.  This was not a day for cold breakfast.  The warmth of a hot chocolate and coffee mixture did wonders to get me temporarily warmed up.  That said it took forever to get packed up.  I would need to stop every few minutes to get my hands warmed back up again and stomp around a bit in order to get some warmth generated.  BTW, I was pleased with the performance of my sleep system; the bag and liner combo kept me plenty warm, and I was not even wearing my warmest clothing layers, so I felt like I could probably be fine in even colder weather.  That said, the 12 hours of inactivity that comes with ending the hiking day, and being in camp inevitably makes for some cold uncomfortable times.   I finally got out of camp just before 9, with Jeff, AOG, and Mule all still there eating and/or packing.  The one other guy (name unknown) got out of camp before me, and it was time for me to (literally) follow his footsteps down the trail. Not knowing exactly how my trail runners were going to perform in the snow, I was pretty cautious early on, and attempted to land my footfalls into the established prints.  As it turned out, the trail runners (Altra Lone Peaks) actually performed pretty well, and my confidence grew as the morning progressed. It was still pretty darn cold, but the heat I generated allowed me to keep my heavier layers in the bag, and not on my body.  I stopped at Flint Mountain shelter after a few hours to have a bite to eat and get ready for the rest of the afternoon hike.  Jeff arrived just as I was finishing up, and seemed in good spirits as he had stayed dry in the shelter like me, and his gear had mostly dried from the disaster two nights ago.  I dropped quite a bit of elevation over the next few miles, and even got below the point where frozen precipitation had accumulated.  I passed through the picturesque Devils Fork Gap, where some nice pastureland offered a break from the normal woods walk environment.  It was just a gap, however, which meant it was time to climb back up into the icy upper elevations.  I passed a beautiful waterfall shortly after the gap; the falls were right at the cusp of where the ice started forming again, so that when you looked upwards at the falls, they were stunningly framed against a million tentacles of icy branches.  I hope the photo captures at least some of that beauty.  As I climbed higher and higher, it was again getting colder and colder, and I was beginning to dread another 12 hours of upcoming inactivity in a cold camp.  I had not decided whether I was going to tent, or whether I was going to do another shelter night. It was supposed to be about ten degrees colder tonight than last night, but probably little to no precipitation.  Around three, I encountered a mother-daughter duo who were out slackpacking a section hike.  They had started a few years back working through the mileage of the AT and were well along on the process. On top of that, for the second time in about a week, this was someone who was familiar with my tiny little hometown.  It turns out they had spent the past 20 or more summers vacationing in the next town over, and hanging out on Maranacook Lake, where I spent my youth swimming and canoeing.  Again, small world. Aside from the hometown connection, there was actually a more important piece of the conversation: they had stopped for lunch at the shelter where I was planning to spend the night, and had been encountering northbounders all day (they were southbound). When I asked how many northbounders indicated that they were staying at the shelter for the night, they said “none, they are all going an extra two miles and getting off trail at Sams Gap to get into a hotel or hostel for the night”.  Hmmmmm.    I had not really been thinking along those lines, but once they mentioned it, I pretty much knew what I was going to do. Within minutes, I thankfully had cell coverage, and I had found availability at an Erwin, TN hotel, and found a shuttle driver who could get me from Sam’s Gap to the hotel.  At that point, I started hauling ass down the trail. There was a warm bed, and warm food with my name on it.  I was at the gap by 6:15, and Steve from Unicoi Hiker Shuttles had me to the hotel in no time, providing some great local trail advice along the way.  There was a Mexican restaurant next door, and soon fajita steam was wafting over my table, and a Corona was standing by to extinguish any spice fires that might occur. I couldn’t help but compare my new situation with what I was previously planning for the evening. Thank you to the Mother/Daughter hiker ladies who planted the seed in my head! A steaming hot shower and a couple phone calls later, and I was done for the night.","Jerry’s Cabin Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660763,"I made the decision last night that I was going to spend two nights in this hotel, and slackpack a 13 mile section of trail from Sam’s Gap to Spivey gap today.  With such a short distance and minimal pack load, I didn’t need to start particularly early, so I arranged for Steve at Unicoi to pick me up at 9:30.  I chowed down on the included continental breakfast and loaded up on hot brewed coffee.  On the ride to Sam’s, Steve said “I just delivered a couple guys to Sam’s to do the same thing you are doing, and I think they know you”.  Turns out Navigator and Daddy Llama were staying at a close by hotel and were now just a couple miles ahead of me.  The temps as expected had dropped a lot from the prior afternoon, and it was well below freezing even down in the Gap. The wind was also blowing a steady 15+ mph, and stronger up on the ridges.  The trail was pretty reasonable, and the cold weather actually had a great effect, in that the ground has frozen solid, and instead of the slippery mud which had dominated the footing conditions yesterday, I now had a nice hard-pan surface, albeit a surface that was coated with increasingly more snow the higher I went in elevation.   Soon I was back into the a full-on winter wonderland, with the iced and snowed trees providing an entertaining visual landscape.  I was clipping along at about 3mph, and was soon at the grassy summit of Big Bald at 5500’.  It was 17 degrees, the wind was now howling at 30mph out of the NW, and I was having a blast.  I was following the footsteps of Nav and DL through 6 inch snowdrifts, and working to stay oriented to the trail as it zigzagged back and forth across the bald.   The visibility was only about 100 yards, which was too bad, since there are supposedly very fine views from up there.  That said the close-in views of iced grass, iced bushes, and iced trees was really pretty cool.  The song of the day in my head was Right Here Right Now  by Fatboy Slim for no other reason than it was the background of a commercial I watched while eating breakfast.  If any of you of a certain age remember the video for the song (you know, back when MTV played videos) it is a pretty hilarious animation of several million years of species evolving and hiking across the earth.  Pretty appropriate, no?  I came to a bit of an epiphany during the hike this morning; I really enjoy HIKING in cold weather (it’s almost mandatory when your grow up in Maine), but I don’t love the 12 hour camping downtime in the evening.  Cold weather camping can be a lot of fun when you are doing it for just a night or two and are bringing along lots of (typically heavy) gadgetry to make the outing entertaining.  What’s better than bacon on a cast iron skillet sizzling on a campfire on a chilly, maybe even snowy, morning at a campsite?  Perfection!  When you have to strip away all that stuff to keep your pack weight manageable for 2000 miles, the really cold wet nights to me are just a somewhat unpleasant interlude between the fun daytime hiking sessions. Fortunately for me, when I say “cold”, I typically mean something below 25 degrees, or perhaps conditions with wind chill below 20 or so.   I’ll probably only have a dozen or so of those nights on this trip, so it’s not that big of a deal, I just am not going to plan other trips with the express purpose of seeking cold weather camping.  Not my thing.  Ok, enough epiphany. After about three hours I caught up to Nav and DL and a hiker named Michelin Star who had shared the shuttle with them this morning. He is a Romanian guy who has lived in Ireland for the past 20+ years owning and operating restaurants.  The four of us completed the rest of the hike together, and we were soon greeted by Steve who had actually hiked in a couple tenths of a mile from Spivey gap to meet us.   Before long it was back to the hotel, shower and over to the Mexican food place take two, this time with the company of Nav and DL.  When I got back to the hotel, I also found out that Chief and Michelle had come off trail today and were doing pretty much the same thing as me, just a day later, since they had stayed an extra day in Hot Springs. We spent some time catching up, and then it was time to make some calls to family, do some journal uploads, and shut it down for the night.","Sam’s Gap

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661017,"It still seems a bit odd waking up in a full service hotel on this little outdoor adventure of mine, but that was the path I choose, and I gotta admit, it’s pretty nice.   I decided to do another slackpack hike today, again with Nav, Dl, and Michelin Star. 
We would get Steve to shuttle us to Spivey Gap, we would hike into Uncle Johnnys Hostel (which is right on the trail) have a quick bite, and then continue for another 9 miles or so afterwards, with Steve again shuttling us home.   This actually worked well for me, because my original and current plan was to spend tonight (Wednesday) at Uncle Johnnys. Since Nav and DL were already staying at Uncle Johnnys, I would check out of my hotel this morning and then leave my stuff at Johnnys when we picked them up in the shuttle in the morning.  The mid-day stop at Johnnys also allowed me to get checked in and do the small amount of resupply that I needed for the coming days.  Logistics, logistics, logistics.   I had my hearty continental breakfast and a fairly relaxed morning, since Steve wasn’t available to shuttle us until 10:00.  When Steve arrived, Michelin Star was already in the shuttle (he was in a different hotel) and I got my stuff loaded up and we were off to pick up Nav and DL at Johnnys (and drop my stuff that I didn’t need for the day’s hike).  Steve quickly had us out to Spivey Gap, fueling us with Dunkin Munchkins that he had bought as a snack for us.  So thoughtful!  It was a perfect morning for hiking, and soon the four of us were stomping up into the hills.  The first half of the hike flew by with lots of chatter amongst the four hikers. Nav and I were paired up most of the morning, and we spent time discussing the difference between Russian and US stuff like public transport, housing styles, weather, and mandatory military service. Interesting indeed.  It turns out that he has some family living just a few miles from where I live in NC, so perhaps we will get a chance to have a beer back in the non-trail world.   We were soon descending down into the gorge through which the Nolichucky river flows into Erwin TN, and had some fantastic views down into the river and town.  We got to Johnnys a bit before 2:00, and I grabbed some food and got checked in with the manager Mountain Drew. He was a really interesting guy, as most hostel owners/operators are.   He had a very relaxed vibe, and was restocking shelves while listening to the Grateful Dead, however he also had a 38 magnum revolver strapped to his chest.  Interesting mix.   Soon the four of us had completed what we needed to get done, so we headed across the adjacent bridge to cross the Nolichucky, and we set off for the rest of the afternoon hike.  We passed by a number of spots where the local rafting outfits put their rafts into the river, and lots of dwellings set up to enjoy the beauty of the river gorge.  It was a pleasant afternoon for hiking, but there was still plenty of snow and ice on some of the north-facing slopes, and as we got later into the afternoon, my choice of shorts and a long sleeve t-shirt was occasionally a bit on the thin side.   But, we all pushed on and made good time, getting in to Indian Grave Gap at about 6:30.  Dave swung us by a pizza shop on the way home, and I had a nice Philly steak sandwich for dinner once I got back to Johnnys.  I had arranged for one of the cabins, and it was pretty cold when I arrived, so the sandwich got me warmed up until the heater kicked on.  I made use of the community shower (a bit of a step down after private hotel showering the past two nights), and despite there being serval people sitting around a campfire, I decided to tumble off to sleep.","Spivey Gap

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661020,"The last day of Erwin-originating shuttle-assisted hiking was here. Steve picked up Nav, Dl, and I from Johnnys, with Michelin Star already in the car.  MS was going to do another shorter day of slackpacking compared to what Nav, DL and I had planned, so I suspect today might be the last day I see him for a while.  Too bad, he is a great guy to hike with.  At my request, Steve stopped by Bojangles for a Bacon Egg and Cheese biscuit and coffee to fuel the morning hike.   My friends and family who don’t live in the southeast don’t know what they are missing without this little greasy fast food option.   We put feet onto trail at 8:00 and started ascending back up into the mountains. We quickly reached a grassy bald area, named “beauty spot” and it would definitely be a great spot to camp during warm weather.   We reached Cherry Gap Shelter at noon-ish and stopped for a bite to eat.  All day we were hiking through frozen areas.  Most of the rime ice had blown off the tree branches, however there was still plenty of snow on the ground, and several frozen waterfalls.  The air temp was actually quite reasonable, and there was abundant sunshine, so it was a great environment for the hike. I was uplifted by a text earlier in the day from Stickers, the guy who I had hiked with for much of the first three weeks on trail.   He unfortunately had to get off trail for a few days to deal with putting down his very sick dog and dealing with a couple other family issues.  He is now back on trail, and starting to crush miles; he is about 100 miles behind me now, so I doubt I will see him for a while, but he was really enjoying the hike, so I’m happy for him that he is back on trail.  DL, Nav and I all reached the Clyde Smith shelter by 4:00 or so, which after Springing Ahead to DST, seems like early afternoon with the sun not setting until after 7:30pm.  We had a relaxing couple hours of warm afternoon daylight and thought that it might just be the three of us at the shelter.   At roughly 6:30, though, a couple other hikers, Asset, a young guy who just graduated a semester early from Carnegie Mellon, and ET from Montreal, arrived at the shelter.  So, a note about hiking speed: Nav, DL, and I have now been hiking with or near each other for the past ten days or so because our speeds and our expectations for a full day hiking distance are pretty aligned.  I would guess that we are on the faster and longer end of the spectrum of through-hikers, since we seem to only encounter folks who started well before us as we pass by them.   That said, we are definitely not THE fastest or longest; there are definitely some miles eaters out there.  Asset and ET fall into that class.  Those two guys did a 26 mile day today in a little less time than it took the three of us to stomp out 18.  Those two were also planning to do a 33 mile day tomorrow, which is a distance that I can’t even comprehend at this point.   It was also interesting to me how two hikers of very different shapes and sizes could crush miles like that.  Asset, as mentioned, was in his early twenties, and was long and lean, looking like the cross country runners I used to compete against back in high school.  ET on the other hand, was probably in his late thirties or early forties, and built like a bearded navy seal, with legs like tree trunks and a powerful build.  Both of them had started in Georgia more than a week after me; I’m guessing that they will complete the trail in less than four months.   Unreal.  Anyway, the pleasant afternoon turned into a comfortable evening, and after cooking up food, it was time to shut down for he night.","Indian Grave Gap

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661047,"As expected, the rain started overnight, and the temps had cooled off.  As such, I was somewhat dreading leaving my warm sleeping bag inside the dry shelter.   But, as is often the case, the dread was more overblown than the actual conditions.  I got underway in a light drizzle, and started descending down into Hughes Gap.  It was fairly easy terrain, and the walking was actually quite enjoyable.  And Hughes Gap now has a new name.  Last night before bedtime, we all received a text from Dave the shuttle driver.  As mentioned, Dave was just awesome; super-friendly, very hiker-supportive, and just an all around good guy.   As his last act, his text to us last night had a picture of a cooler that was awaiting us down in Hughes Gap in the morning.  As we arrived and found the cooler, there was much rejoicing, as it was St Patrick’s day, and there was a three Guinness stouts there waiting for us. That gap is now officially rechristened “Guinness Gap”.  I actually didn’t think that, despite my affinity for a good Irish beverage, a stout was going to mix well with the upcoming 2500 foot climb, so I left it there unopened for the next hiker to have a bit of trail Magic.  It’s a good thing that was the case, because the rest of the day was brutal, even without a pint of stout sloshing in my belly.  Immediately after Guinness Gap, I started a long climb up Roan mountain.  This 6200 foot beast required 2200 feet of almost constant ascension from the gap.  As I rose higher and higher, it was clear that this stretch was going to be icy and dangerous.   I knew that there was probably going to be at least one day on this trip where I somewhat regretted leaving my micro spikes back home (purposely), and today was it.  I’m guessing that the trail to the top is normally a flowing river in warmer times, because today it was one long river of ice, and the footing was very treacherous.  Of course, as I rose in altitude, the temps dropped , and the winds increased.   From 5500 feet of elevation onward, it was ice sheets and icy clouds that limited visibility to 100 yards or less.   I’ve read that this can be a beautiful hike in nice weather, but I honestly just wanted to get over the top, and get on to a different section of trail.  I stopped for about three minutes at the top to snap a picture, and eat a bar.  It was at the top that I caught up with DL and Navigator, who had both gotten out of the shelter and out of Guinness Gap before me.   All of us just wanted to get off the mountain as quick as possible.   I quickly started the descent and let gravity move my chilled body down the hill, with short quick toe taps on any exposed rocks or gravel that could slow my progress down the ice sheet.  It was a welcome relief when I finally got low enough that footing was more available and predictable.  Throughout this time, the song of the day rattling in my head was Shakedown Street by the Grateful Dead, which was the last song I heard at Uncle Johnnys a couple days before. Jerry, Phil and the boys helped take my mind off the wet and cold for a while at least.At 5500 foot elevation I reached Carvers Gap, where a major road crosses the mountain, and there is parking for day hikers to go explore the Roan Highlands section that I was about to enter.   These highlands are a continuous grassy bald, that in summertime attract hordes of hikers and overnight campers exploring the crisscross network of trails that cover the area.  Ummmm, yeah, today, there was not a soul, because what idiot wants to be walking across this massive exposed open space with freezing rain falling from the sky, and 30 mph wind constantly blowing the wet air through your core?  (Answer, “this idiot”).  I could tell that the forest service has made attempts over the years to “improve” the trails across the bald, as there was obviously some non-natural surfaces that had been laid down in many areas.  Unfortunately, they seem to be fighting a losing battle, since the trails were just a wet slop of six inch deep mud.  As much as I hated to not follow Leave No Trace principles which say “walk in established trails” , I found myself walking on the edges of the grassy boundary areas, since the mud slop would have yanked the shoes right off my feet.  Every so often, I would pass a sign indicating that I had summited another “bald” on this collection of bald summits (Round bald, Jane bald, grassy Ridge Bald), but I still could only see 100 yards ahead, the slop was still grabbing at my shoes, and the wind was still trying to pull my rain jacket off my body, so I didn’t exactly linger to celebrate the accomplishments. Finally, I finished crossing these grassy meadows, and reentered the relative shelter of the woods to continue the day’s journey.  Soon I arrived at the Stan Murray shelter, which was going to be my home (and Dl and Nav’s) for the next 14 hours or so.  We all got settled in, cooked up some hot food, and then I buried down into my sleeping bag for what I expected might be a bit of a chilly night.","Clyde Smith Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661050,"Last night I reminded myself that camping in sub-freezing weather is not the part of the experience that I most cherish.   It was 22 in the shelter this morning, and the clouds creating rime ice and snow had blown a covering of snow into the shelter and onto my sleeping bag and other gear.  This didn’t totally freak me out, since I knew I was staying in a warm hostel this coming evening, but I also wasn’t overjoyed.  My body was actually reasonably warm last night, and I wasn’t even wearing all of my available layers.  The one exception was my feet, as they were pretty cold, and prevented me from having a particularly restful sleep.  As always, the worst part was actually getting out of the bag, and getting ready to hit the trail. The cold fingers and toes make this ritual a chore, but once I actually got on trail, I was plenty warm and moved right along.  The first order of the day was a climb up over Little Hump Mountain, and then over regulation sized Hump Mountain.  Once again, as has unfortunately been the case often recently, I was socked in with freezing fog for the morning climb, and the northwest wind was blowing at a sustained 35 mph throughout most of the morning hike.  Probably an onlooker would have thought I had too much Guinness in my system, because I kept getting blown sideways by the wind and stumbling my way up the mountains.   What is really ironic (or is it disappointing? Or annoying?) is that if I had been crossing the “humps” just three hours later, the wind would have subsided, and a beautiful view off into the nearby mountain ranges would have revealed itself.  But alas, that was not my fate this day, so I will need to return to this area sometime in a future summer to get the full positive vibes the place surely has to offer.  I do find it a bit amusing that the name “Little Hump” is used to describe a mountain that is three hundred feet higher, at 5500 feet, than the big dog mountain, Katahdin, that I grew up thinking was the beast of the east.  As I was reaching the summit of Hump, I was finally catching up to Daddy Llama, who had left the shelter a bit before me. He paused on the summit for a moment, and the framing of his figure in the blowing fog made for a pretty cool picture.  I stopped about 50 yards from the summit and pulled out my camera and yelled up to him to raise his arms and poles for the picture.  I snapped the shot, and it was a great photo of DL.  Or so I thought.  I put the phone/camera away and continued marching to the summit, where as I got close enough that the ice fog was not impairing my vision, I found that it was not DL, but rather some random guy out for a day hike who was wondering why there was a lunatic coming up behind him demanding that he raise his arms.  Once I assured the fellow that he was safe, and I was not going to steal his backpack, we had a good laugh, and I continued along my merry way.Finally, after taking the beating from Mother Nature on the way up to the Hump summit, it was time for a six mile, 3000 foot descent down to highway 19e near Roan Mountain, TN, and the Station 19 hostel where I was staying that night.  Once I finally got down into the lower elevations (sub 3500 or so), the icy footing, icy clouds, and whipping wind gave way to a surprisingly pleasant Saturday afternoon down in the valley.  I passed by a good sized Christmas Tree farm that was tucked into the hillside, and passed a sign that told me I was leaving NC.  Of course I thought I had left NC like three days ago, so, who knew? 
I arranged for the hostel owner, Dave, to pick me up at the trailhead, and soon I was in a hot shower relaxing the hiking muscles that had taken a pounding for the last couple days.  The scales at the hostel told me that I was down more than 20 pounds since the start of the hike, so it was time to go to the attached pub and start loading in some foods.  They had some really great sub sandwiches, and the mozzarella sticks were a nutritious (?) addition to the meal as well. Michelin Star was also at the hostel, so it was great to catch up with him a bit. Nav and DL were staying at a place about a mile down the road, but their place did not have food, so they ended up joining me as well.  Station 19 is a bit of a unique place in that it’s a combination hostel, craft beer pub, and music venue all wrapped into one property. This particular Saturday mid-afternoon was an “afternoon jam” for local bluegrass musicians, and I got a chance to listen in as about a dozen folks all played together with guitar, fiddle, banjo, upright bass, mouth harp, and a few other instruments and ran through a couple hours of just jamming.  It was really a treat to listen in.  Eventually my lack of sleep from the prior night, the heavy food in my stomach, and the couple beers got the better if me, and I took my exhausted self up to sleep for the night.","Stan Murray Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661051,"After a couple tough days in the cold high elevations of east TN, what an absolutely pleasurable hike today turned out to be.  I had arranged with the hostel owner that I (and Nav and Dl) would be shuttled out to a forest service road crossing about 15 trail miles north (but only about ten road minutes away from the hostel). We would then walk southbound back to the hostel for a nice slackpack 15. I was not in a particular rush, so I arranged for a 10am pickup.  This allowed me time to cook up some pancakes and eggs in the communal kitchen and continue chipping away at the calorie deficit that I have been accumulating. There were two ladies (Woodchuck and Bad Bat) and a guy  (Ranger Dan) who headed out on an earlier shuttle to go tackle the Roan Highlands and Humps that I had recently completed.  About 45 minutes after they left, they all returned to the hostel after collectively deciding with Dave the hostel owner that it was just too dangerous to be up there at those elevations today, given the frigid weather and windy conditions. Probably a very smart move on their part based on what I had experienced yesterday.  The two women decided to join me, and DL and Nav for the southbound slackpack, since this section of trail was much lower elevation and probably a reasonable piece of trail to chew on for the day.  We all got dropped off at the trailhead around 10:00 and it was time to get rolling.  There was some light snow floating in the air, and the temp was just below freezing, but it looked like it might shape up for the rest of the day.  Navigator and I had a quick pace going today, so we were soon out there on our own.  It turned out to be a really easy section of trail, and probably the easiest full-mileage day I have had on trail thus far.  The snow stopped after an hour or so, the sun appeared, and it was a really enjoyable late winter/ early spring walk in the woods.  The terrain was just a series of gently rolling hills, and some meandering streams. With one exception.  A short side trail (ya gotta take the blue blaze side trails every so often!) led to Jones Falls, a spectacular 100+ foot waterfall that was glistening with icicles in the afternoon sun that had appeared.  Wow.   
Today’s song was triggered by Navigator mentioning that the trail was really more Eastbound than northbound.  Soon enough I was internally belting out Eastbound and Down by Jerry Reed.  If you are a fan of cheesy 70’s Burt Reynolds movies, you will know which one I’m talking about.  To be clear, I had neither Sally Field nor a lovable basset hound along as my sidekick for the day.
We finished out the rest of the hike at a brisk pace and were done with the 15 miler in a bit less than five hours.  I was soon back at the hostel for warm food, hot shower, and a beer with the gathered hiker clan, including Popcorn and Cup of Tea who I had not seen since last Saturday.   Everyone was pretty bushed (including me), so after completing my resupply from the hostel’s offering, it was time to shut down for the night.","Station 19

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661067,"Another fantastic day!  Two in a row!  I, along with DL, Nav, and Michelin Star, had decided to arrange a slackpack out of the Hwy 19E area for the day.   After yesterday’s 15 mile slack, today would be a 19 miler from the forest service road where yesterday’s hike ended (or was it started?  It’s so confusing once you start mixing in southbound hikes) over to the southwest shore of Watauga lake and the Boots Off hostel.   The day started with a great group of people in the communal kitchen of Station 19.  We took turns manning the griddle and churning out semi-perfect pancakes to fuel the morning hike.  Woodchuck, Bad Bat, Michelin Star, Ranger Dan, Ice Box, and a couple from Wisconsin all enjoyed some of the grub included with the modest price of our bed for the night.  Randy, our shuttle driver, picked up Michelin Star and I at 8:45, and we trucked a mile down the road to pick up Nav and Dl from the Mountain Harbor hostel.  They had been taunting me for the past two days about the quality of the breakfast they had as part of their nightly package.  It was an accurate and well-founded taunt….my self-made pancakes versus a professional chef making strudel, scones, maple and bacon infused hash browns, spiral cut ham and homemade yogurts?  C’mon, no contest.  At least Nav was kind enough to smuggle out a couple homemade biscotti and share them with MS and I.   Randy quickly shuttled us up to the forest service road trailhead, and the hike for the day commenced.  It was chilly,  maybe a few degrees below freezing, but clear blue sky and no wind….good hiking weather.   The first several miles were a series a gently rolling hills, and we all made good time.  We stopped for a quick break and snack at Moreland Gap shelter, and then set back off.  Randy had mentioned that Emoji, a local trail Angel, was going to be doing trail Magic from her car at the Dennis Cove Road trailhead, which we would be hitting in the early afternoon. Sure enough, as we approached that spot, a kind face was marching up the trail towards us. She was getting a bit of exercise and was about a mile in from the trailhead when we met her.  She turned right back around and led us down the trail, providing lots of local trail knowledge tidbits along the way.  We reached the trailhead, and she opened her rolling hiker refuel station, and pumped us full of Gatorade, apples, snacks, cheeses, and all manner of afternoon sustenance.   She had a bunch of chairs arrayed around the car, and Nav, Dl, and I lounged in the comfort of Emoji’s care.  The only concerning thing: Michelin Star was not with us.  The four of us are pretty well-matched hikers…over the past several days, if all four of us started a hike at the same point, we would usually not be dispersed by more than a couple minutes or so even after several hours of hiking.  We had stopped just a couple hours ago for that snack, and had now been walking slowly with Emoji for 30 minutes, and then stopped at Emoji’s car for another 20 minutes without a sign of MS.  Finally he emerged from the woods, and the story was clear; he had fallen quite ill, and had been vomiting since we last saw him. In short, he had not been feeling great since eating the pancakes back at the hostel.   Fortunately the trailhead was only about a half-mile from where he was planning to spend the night (his original plan was to get shuttled back to this spot after completing 19 miles), and the hostel owner happened to stop by in a vehicle as we were stopped with Emoji. She took MS back to the hostel so that he could rest and recuperate.  Get well soon Michelin Star!  DL, Nav, and I thanked Emoji profusely for her kindness, and it was time to get moving into the second half of the day.  We quickly traversed an old flat rail bed, and were then presented with the highlight of the day; Laurel Falls and its spectacular cascade that was lit perfectly by the sunshine of the day.  We arrived just as another young day-hiking couple did, and we took turns taking each other’s pictures in front of the falls.  It turns out that the couple was in the area looking for a wedding venue to host their upcoming nuptials.  They seemed quite a well matched couple, and I’m sure they will be quite happy together.  In my opinion, they probably could have just found some random guy to perform the ceremony in front of the Falls, and it would have been just as good as a big hoo-hah at a venue.  But what do I know, Dylana and CJ?  The songs of the day alternated between Johnny Cash “ I walk the Line” after DL queued it up during our snack break, and Bill Medley’s “I’ve Had the Time of My Life” because, well, I’m having the time of my life.  I kept looking around for Patrick Swayze to give me a Lift, but alas, no such luck.  Nobody puts Rambler in a corner.  The rest of the afternoon was dominated by a 1800 foot climb over a knob (unsure of name), and the subsequent descent down to Watauga Lake.  We wrapped up the day by getting checked into Boots Off, and inhaling a frozen pizza, and then shutting it down for the night.","Forest service road 293
",Boots Off Hostel,"Mar 20, Mon",19.50
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661275,"Had a good night’s sleep at Boots Off hostel. I split one of the their cabins with Nav, and it was plenty comfortable.   They had a good breakfast available, lots of cereal, donuts, coffee, fruits, and such.  We shared a meal table with Danger, a retired military medic with 23 deployments, and Al-Mighty, another hiker from Quebec. Nav and I hit the trail at 8:00, and got busy with the partial circumnavigation of Lake Watauga. This is another of the dammed TVA project lakes, and it sits in a gorgeous valley.  The first part of the hike was pretty flat, as we circled past some beaches and woods at the southern end of the lake, and then started ascending up to and over the dam itself.  When I get back to having cell service, I need to google the specifics of the dam, because oddly, there was no water flowing on the opposite side of the dam.  I’m not sure if there are pipes moving the water away, or perhaps an outlet stream in some other corner of the lake, but it was dry as a bone at the dam itself.  As we left the dam area, we started somewhat steadily ascending a ridge that we would traverse for pretty much the entire day. There is an acronym that is used in the hiker lexicon, PUD…Pointless Ups and Downs.  This ridge seemed to have a lot of those…rather than staying on the spine of the ridge, we would drop a couple hundred feet elevation for a half mile or so, and then gain it right back again to re-summit the ridge again.  That said, it was really a picturesque morning, as the view down into and across the lake valley on a sunny day was top notch.   I was wondering for a while whether the lake allowed boating, since I did not see anyone actively boating or any docks for the first few hours, but finally when I was alongside the northern end of the lake, I started to see some marinas. At about 11:00, I reached one of the most perfectly situated shelters that I have seen thus far. Sitting on a sharp edge of the ridge spine overlooking the lake, with a massive rock formation alongside it was Vandeventer Shelter.  I ordered the house specialties for lunch: Tuna a la Rambler (tuna squeezed out of a pouch onto a tortilla), and a PB&T (peanut butter squeezed out of a pouch onto a tortilla), and the matre’d found me a nice spot on the rock where I was able consume the fine cuisine.  I will leave a fine review on Yelp when I get to town.   I should have mentioned at the top of this entry, that today was planned as my longest hike of the trip thus far, at 24 miles.  Navigator, who hiked this section last year, had been advising DL and I that it was a fairly gentle section compared to many of our previous days, so I was hopeful that I would blast through the day like a hot knife through warm butter.  That was not quite the case.  The first 6 miles were indeed gentle, and even had a couple miles of dirt road and paved road walking near the dam area.  Mile 6 through 18 of the day, however, kicked my butt.  It wasn’t super steep, or even particularly bad footing, but the cumulative mileage for the day and the constant up down, wore me down.   Even with the nice weather and the constant great view to the lake valley, I was getting mentally fatigued.  Since I had pretty good cell coverage I even resorted to listening to a streaming service (Pandora) for a while.  A couple hours of U2, Police, Talking Heads, The Cure, Peter Gabriel and Depeche Mode definitely helped, but it was going to be a long day.  Finally at about mile 18 for the day, my FarOut app showed that the upcoming elevation profile chart pointed downward, and while that slope in a stock market chart is bad news for my retirement, today it meant the worst was behind me.  In fact it was a rather oddly abrupt transition.  I descended for a ways down off the ridge to a parking area next to TN route 91, and on the other side of the road, suddenly the AT was traversing a gently sloped meadow, with crushed gravel pathways that were labeled as handicapped accessible.  Two things: A) I think it very cool that our tax dollar has funded an Accessible piece of parkland like this…very worthwhile investment in my book; and 2) my battered body was very happy to see anything that was gently sloped at this point in the late afternoon.  There was a really interesting old barn with a massive white wooden AT logo affixed to the outside, and there were livestock fences and gates that partitioned the meadows at several points.  I did not see any livestock, and I’m not sure if this was private land with an AT right-of-way, or perhaps it was some land managed by one of our government agencies, but either way, the views from the meadows to the surrounding mountain ranges really were enjoyable.  For a few minutes, the walk reminded me of time when I would help out at my grandparents dairy farm; their pastureland for the cows also sits up on a ridge, and you can see the White Mountains of NH off in the distance. After the meadows there were just a few more miles of reasonable wooded terrain, and I finally reached double spring shelter at 6:30, with close to 24 miles in the books.  It was good to have gotten that many miles completed but I am worried that I might be stepping up the mileage a bit too much and/or too fast.  My Achilles and Plantar fascia on my right foot have been starting to hurt a bit, mostly late in the day during long days, and mostly on steeper uphills.  I will need to pay attention to this and either dial back the miles for a few days, or even take my first zero mile day of the trip someday soon.  Maybe the body isn’t supposed to go 32 days in a row without a break?  Anyway, DL and Nav were both overnighting at the same shelter, so we had some good conversation over dinner and shut it down quickly to get some rest for the wet 19 miler into Damascus tomorrow.","Boots Off Hostel

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661276,"I was hoping the weather forecasters were going to be incorrect by a couple hours or more. Their forecast last night called for rain to start at 5 AM this morning, but I hoped that maybe I would get lucky and get a few extra dry hours  to get my tent packed away and breakfast eaten before getting wet. Unfortunately the forecasters were very much accurate, and the rain started before I woke up at about 5 AM. The shelter elevation was at 4000 feet, and at that height unfortunately the rain was partially falling as sleet and freezing rain, since the temps were pretty much exactly at the freezing point. Fortunately the rain was fairly light, so other than some chilled hands while getting the tent packed away, it was not too bad of a pack-up time this morning. I had a 19 mile day planned to get me from the shelter into the town of Damascus. The elevation profile on the FarOut app indicated that it would be a pretty easy walk, and I was hoping that I could get into town by early afternoon to start getting some much needed rest. Damascus is a highly anticipated town for most AT hikers.  It’s a very trail-centric town, with the AT literally traversing about a mile of the towns’ streets, including the main boulevard. It is a town very much oriented towards outdoor recreation tourism, with the Virginia Creeper rail trail also running through town. The combination of hiker visitors and bicycling visitors means that there are several outfitters in town, and lots of lodging options.  I was unfortunately not timing my arrival to correspond with the town-hosted Trail Days Festival, which has parades, lots of vendors with new gear and a generally celebratory atmosphere, but nonetheless I was still very much looking forward to the arrival.  With all the nights in hostels last week, I wasn’t necessarily craving a soft bed and restaurant food, but my body was craving rest for my tired muscles.  I got on trail at 7:30, at the same time as DL, and the two of us walked and talked for the first couple hours of the hike.  It was fairly easy walking, even with the slightly slippery footing from the freezing rain.  I can’t tell you much about the surrounding terrain, because it was another of those days where visibility was limited to about 500 feet because of low clouds and fog.  I forgot to mention in yesterday’s post about the new addition to my hiking wardrobe.  But first another riveting aside about a bit of hiker culture (you can’t wait, can you?). At most hiker hostels, and at many outfitters, and even a few other random places, there will be a bin known as a “hiker box”.  In this bin will typically be pieces of gently used gear that a prior hiker has decided he/she no longer wants to carry in his backpack.  Maybe it didn’t fit correctly, maybe their backpack was too heavy with other stuff, or some other random reason.  Actually some of the hostels have two such bins, one for food items and one for non-food.  There, now if you are watching Jeopardy later tonight and Alex queues up “boring hiker tidbits for $500”, you will be all set.  Anyway….I had been debating adding a pair of rain pants to my kit. They did not make the cut when I left home a month ago, and thus far I had been ok with the decision.   My hiking pants, which are water repellent but not water proof, during the first three weeks of warm weather had mostly only been used in camp, but had recently seen more active duty during the freezing weather of the past ten days or so.  I had been pretty happy with their performance (other than the fact that I have lost so much weight that they fall off me without industrial strength belting to hold them up), but they had not really been tested with multiple days in a row of falling precipitation.  Without making this any more drawn out than it already is….I wanted rain pants, so I blinked my eyes twice like I Dream of Genie, and a perfectly fitting pair of rain pants appeared in the hiker box at Boots Off hostel.  So with this morning’s weather, the question was: what to wear under the rain pants? DL and Nav both wear long pants all the time, and when it’s wet they wear rain pants over long pants.  I’m generally pretty warm when hiking, so I opted for shorts under mine, and I gotta say, I was pretty happy with the results.  It hovered in the high thirties or maybe low forties all morning while it rained on me, and my lower half was reasonably dry, and not too hot and not too cold.  I’m not sure the pants will stay in the bag once I’m reasonably assured of leaving the coldest rainy weather behind, but for right now, I’m accepting the additional weight into the pack.   Because it was indeed rainy and chilly, I really don’t bother stopping at all during the 19 miles, and I was in town by 2:00.  My Achilles was definitely barking at me again today, and some changes definitely need to be forthcoming. For today though, I got checked into the Dancing Bear Inn, got a wonderful hot shower, and headed over to the Damascus Diner to load a mid afternoon meal into me.  I ran into Al-Mighty there, and Nav ended up joining as well. A fantastic meatloaf sandwich, onion rings, chips and queso, salad, and many cokes helped out a dent in the continuing calorie deficit.  I went back to the Inn and put my feet up for a couple hours to get some rest. I headed back for round two at the diner (the restaurant options in town were pretty limited) and tried to shovel in a full BBQ plate full of food, but it was too much too soon after the afternoon meal, and I ended up giving much of the meal to my dining companions.   I am planning to only do a short 7 mile trek to a campsite outside town tomorrow afternoon after resting some more in the morning and running a couple errands.","Double Spring Shelter

And, can I live with blue-blazing a stretch of the AT leaving Damascus?  Stay tuned, intrepid readers. First things first.  I got myself packed up at Dancing Bear, and headed across the street to a coffee shop with Bear Hang and Foz, a British hiker who was staying in the same hostel.   Breakfast sandwiches, biscuits, and coffee all hit the spot.   I stopped at the post office and sent a few items home.  A redundant mid-layer shirt, a pair of socks, and a couple accessories from the new water filter I had to purchase a couple days ago will not longer be weighing down my pack.   Then over to the outfitters. To cut to the chase, I decided to ditch my Altra Lone Peaks after about 200 training miles and 200 trail miles.   The “zero drop” design for which they are known is possibly (probably) contributing to my Achilles issue, and I decided to go with a Topo UltraVenture.  With that major purchase completed, I hoped question 1 was answered.  Question 2 and 3 were quite intertwined.   As mentioned yesterday, the Virginia Creeper trail also runs through Damascus, and intriguingly parallels the AT for several miles.  The “purity” question became, “do I take the Creeper trail for a few miles to break in my shoes and hopefully give my Achilles a break, or do I stick to the AT and only the AT?” Short answer: Creeper trail won.  I walked about 10 or 12 miles of this well-graded, gently sloping trail starting at about noon.  It was actually a really enjoyable walk; the whole stretch ran alongside a river, with sharp hills on each side. There were numerous crosses and re-crosses of the same river, and it was quite picturesque.  That choice, along with my shoe choice also seemed to keep the Achilles pain at bay.  I felt considerably better after a dozen Creeper miles and a few AT miles (I’m not 100% sure how far I walked, I need to go back and check when I have Wi-Fi) than I had the previous two or three days. I stopped for the night at Lost Mountain Shelter, where DL had also stopped, and we were joined by FOZ, Sim (a young British guy), Atticus (a guy from Baltimore), and Boston, who is hiking the AT for the fourth time. I pitched my tent after having some conversation with the new faces, and shut it down for the night, hopeful that the Achilles would continue holding up during tomorrow’s planned 17 miler.","Damascus, VA

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661279,"Had a great night sleep last night, and I was almost giddy to be packing up this morning in very comfortable temperatures. No gloves needed!  Today was the planned entry into an area that I had been very much looking forward to: the Grayson Highlands. This long stretch of high elevation territory is known for its bald, grassy and rocky landscapes, and also for the herds of wild ponies that roam the area. The morning’s hike got the blood pumping early with a 2000 foot climb up to Whitetop Mountain at 5100 feet, passing the really cool outcrop called Buzzard Rock along the way. A steady descent of 500 feet or so brought me to the transition point into the Highlands, which was the crossing of a VA state highway. There was a parking lot here with trash cans and a some nice rocks for sitting, so I chose to each my lunch here along with a few other folks from last nights shelter population.  Across the road was a long sloping meadow which was cross-crossed with quite a trail network.  It’s a very popular place for people to come out and see if the ponies are out and about.   As I started up the sloping meadow with my head on a swivel, looking for ponies, I was really enjoying the landscape, as it was just so different than what I had inhabited for most of the past few weeks.  I know that the reason the landscape looks like this is that early settlers cleared the trees and then periodically set fire to the hilltops to maintain adequate grazing lands, not exactly the most eco-friendly approach by today’s standards, but the visual effect is quite stunning.  A half hour into the afternoon ascent I made an embarrassing error: I was hiking along in the lead, with Navigator on my heels. We were both chatting away, and looking for ponies. Unfortunately the AT made a hairpin turn, and a spur trail to the Mt Rogers summit continued straight. There was a sign, but I blew right by it, and Navigator (despite his trail name) followed me right along. Even worse, Sim, who I didn’t even realize was behind us, assumed I knew what I was doing and followed the two of us.  Fortunately, we only went a tenth of a mile or so, and a couple who we had seen in the parking lot earlier were sitting trail side taking a break.  They said “you guys look like you are thru-hikers, did you really intend to be taking this spur trail?”  I thanked them for their information, tucked my tail (hiking poles?) between my legs, and marched back down the hill to the intersection where I made the error.  Very glad it only cost about 15 minutes of total trail time.
 I continued up through the Highland landscape, looking around every bend and scanning the sloping meadows for the thus far non existent ponies.  Pretty much the whole afternoon continued this way.  The scenery was spectacular, the day was perfect for hiking, with clear blue skies; but no ponies.   Someone just ahead of me had seen one tucked in the brush and had gotten a photo of just the back of the pony rising above the brush, but still no sightings for me.
 I also had a decision upcoming. I was planning for today to be a 17 miler, with a 20 mile jaunt following tomorrow.  The spacing of shelters and potential tentsites provided the opportunity to swap the mileage of the two days and make today a 20.  I figured that I would evaluate my tiredness (particularly if that pesky Achilles was flaring up), the time of day, and the weather when I reached the 17 mile shelter and then make the game time decision.  When I got there, my body was feeling fine, today’s  weather was perfect and tomorrow’s was predicted to be rainy, so I decided to push on. Navigator decided to do the same thing as well.  So I departed the 17 mile shelter, a couple minutes ahead of Nav, resigned to the fact that I was going to have had a pony-free day, since it was getting late, and we had passed through most of the pony-land.  I walked for about five minutes past the shelter, and the unmistakable sound of whinnying came from my right, and there was a beautiful pair of ponies!  Yee hah!  We checked each other out for a couple minutes, and pony one decided to continue in its original direction, and pony two decided it didn’t like the looks of me (or more likely the smell of me….my last shower was in Damascus), and scampered back into the woods.  I continued another 100 yards or so, and there was pony one, now hanging out with two additional ponies.  Does four make a herd? A thundering herd?  Anyway, there was no thunder, just a lot of whinnying back and forth between them as they evaluated the threat level of their two-legged visitor.  Eventually they moved along in no great hurry, and I moved along with a huge smile on my face. Very cool stuff! I continued on a few miles to an fenced-in meadow area known as The Scales. This is apparently the spot where, back in the cattle-ranching days, they would weigh the cattle before they were marched down the mountain to become McBurgers.   It was a bit breezy due to the openness, but otherwise made for a good tenting spot.  I watched a nice sunset, and then let the distant sound of ponies and alarmingly close sound of coyotes mix with the sound of the south wind blowing over the ridge-top put me to sleep.","Lost Mountain Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661282,"So, remember that soothing south wind coming over the ridge tops last night. Yeah, that became full on gale force with sustained 40mph gusting to 60-ish.  I spent a lot of the night holding my tent together while the wind tried to tear it apart.  At about 3am I actually contemplated packing up and hiking onward to a more sheltered area before the rain started.  I didn’t, and the rain started at about 5am, so from then on I was using my hands to hold together a soggy tent. Fortunately it held together enough that I and my stuff stayed dry. I knew the rain was only supposed to last a couple hours, and I thought about waiting it out, but I had enough of sitting there, and decided to go ahead and pack up and start the day. If there was a hidden camera watching me pack up a soggy tent in the whipping wind, somebody could reap some solid money from the syndication rights, because it was surely some good good visual comedy.   Fortunately, it was a warm wind and a relatively warm rain, so the first couple hours of hiking in that stuff actually wasn’t too bad.  The trail also soon turned back into the protected woods, and behind a ridge that blocked much of the wind, so it became a bit less chaotic.  A couple hours into the hike, I arrived at a shelter, and I decided to stop for a while and hang up my tent to dry in the shelter (it was unoccupied) and eat the breakfast that I had skipped during the chaotic pack up period. After hanging out for a bit less than an hour, it was time to get on with the planned 17 mile day. At this point a month or so into my hike, I know I can handle 17 miles reasonably easily, and I decided that after not sleeping well last night, and with the day rapidly shaping up into fine hiking weather (all that wind quickly blew the rain through and left nice blue skies), I decided I was going to slow my pace a bit, and just enjoy the day.   I found myself lingering a bit longer at some of the scenic spots, like a cascading stream where I ate my lunch, again at the thundering falls at Comers Creek, and even just a rock with a great vista to the surrounding mountains during the last hour of my hike, when I would normally just be pushing onward to get to a shelter and get my feet up.  If I had pushed at my normal pace throughout the day, I probably would have gotten to camp at 4:00 or so; today I strolled in at 5:30 or so.  Trading the end of day in-camp restful 90 minutes for an on-trail restful 90 minutes seemed like a good choice on this particular day.  Fortunately, my Achilles issue seems to be fading into the background; I think the shoes, along with some specific stretching and some Vitamin I have helped. At the shelter tonight was Nav, Sim, Atticus, and a couple that collectively are named Nomad. They are attempting the trail for a second time; after getting pretty far along last year, Mr Nomad tore a rotator cuff in NH, and their adventures ended. There was also a VA section hiker named Jim who was in his second to last day of a 200 mile stretch. My tent finished drying out nicely in the late afternoon sunshine and breeze, and I was in my sleeping bag by 6:30, ready to recover some of the sleep deprivation from the prior night.","The Scales

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661426,"It’s a great feeling knowing that you have a Nero town day ahead of you.  I slept great last night, and woke to a cool clear morning in the tent.  Today’s plan was to hike 10 miles to the Mt Rogers Forest HQ, where I would be picked up and shuttled a few miles to Marion, VA for an afternoon of showering, laundry, town food, and resupply shopping.  I was out of camp by 7:45, along with Nav, who had the same plans as me for the day.   The slopes were gentle, and the footing was good this morning, and the 10 miles took us less than 3.5 hours to complete.  A shuttle driver had us into Marion before noontime.  We arrived at the Merry Inn hiker hostel, located right in the middle of a downtown block. A quick aside, I found out a couple days ago, that Zen, the  owner of the Gooder Grove hostel in Franklin NC, where I stayed a few weeks back died suddenly in his sleep.  Zen was a couple years younger than me, and in the brief time I had to know him, seemed like a kind soul.  I hope he is at peace. My hostel for tonight is a very cool setup. A young couple bought the building a couple years back, and have an outfitter shop on the first floor.  They had usable space on the second floor, and have turned it into a very tidy hostel.   It’s a great location near several restaurants, and they shuttled us over to the grocery store at no extra charge.  
I quickly hit the shower and got laundry underway, and shortly thereafter Nav and I were getting some good town food at a local chain restaurant, Macados.   We sat in the bar area which has a number of TV’s showing very random sports on a Sunday afternoon.  There was college lacrosse, golf, some baseball league for young prospects, NASCAR, and some sort of game of “see how fast your dog can retrieve a ball”.   Nav, with whom I always have great conversations about American vs. Russian cultural aspects, asked “is this dog fetching one of the most popular sports in the USA?”  Ummm, the answer is “no”.   We had our fill of casual dining food, and while we were making the short walk back to the hostel, we saw the shuttle driver, and quickly arranged for a hop over to the grocery store, which was just a bit further than we wanted to walk. There was a Walmart and an Ingles in the same building, and after doing a 90 second tour of WalMart’s offerings, decided Ingles would be the shop for us.  Food supplies for the next few days on trail were procured, with an apple being the only thing in the basket that seemed remotely healthy.  Calories + shelf stable + lightweight unfortunately trump freshness and nutrition in the hiker calculus.  Fresh and green are usually reserved for the town visits.  We shuttled back to the hostel, and I was able to make phone calls to several family members…it was great to catch up on things going on in the real off-trail world. Also at the hostel this evening was Foz, Nomads, and a southbound hiker named Trip.  Trip was quite energetic, as he was returning to finish the last 500 southbound miles of the trail after having his hike interrupted by COVID back in November.  He is working on a PhD having something to do with dirt. He joined Nav and I for dinner (again at Macado’s, since most everything else was closed on Sunday), and provided some very animated descriptions of dirt he is studying at some research site in Ethiopia.   Who knew that dirt needed to be researched? I know Mom wanted me to keep it off my clothes, and coach wanted me to rub some of it on any injury and get back in the game, but apparently there is a whole dirt corner of the scientific universe.  We finished up dinner, and I did some journal work while trying to pay attention to a Bruins-Hurricanes game online, and then it was time to shut down.","Trimpi Shelter
",Merry Inn in Marion,"Mar 26, Sun",10
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661428,"Several of us had arranged for a shuttle to pick us up at 7:30, so the hostel was alive by 6:30 or so, as everyone got a coffee and packed themselves up.   From two different ends of the food nutrition spectrum, my breakfast consisted of an apple, and the free honey bun that you got with a stay.   We loaded up five hikers into the pickup, and made the short ride back out to the trail.   Trip was going to a different trailhead, but the Nomads, Nav and I all got on trail at the same spot where yesterday we got off.  
As an aside, a good story about how planning town days can go right or go wrong: yesterday I had arranged for a shuttle while still over six trail miles from the pickup spot, because I knew that cell coverage was non existent at the actual trailhead itself.  The Nomads, who were only an hour or so behind Nav and I, had misunderstood the message about cell coverage and waited until they got to the trailhead to call. No bueno.  It took them over two hours of hanging around at the trail head before they could finally flag down a ride, meaning they only had a couple hours in town before everything shut down.  Anyway, it’s just some of typical logistics “stuff” that you have to think about when doing this long distance hiking thing. 
This morning, Nav and I were off and rolling at a good pace. I think, however, that the days of my pace and Nav’s pace being synced up are coming to an end.  He is planning to do a 24 mile day into another hostel, and then slackpacking 26 tomorrow from that hostel and staying another night there. I don’t need to be pounding out quite that many miles, even if they are slack-packed, and I don’t need to stay in hostels as many nights per week either.   My plan for today was an 18 miler to a campsite, and I’m planning to be in the woods in a tent for probably at least the next four or five nights before another town day.  Anyway, we hiked on together through the morning, across a relatively easy 10 mile stretch,  which offered some nice views off to the west, including a really sweet overlook off towards Walker Mountain.  Sometime during the morning, I flushed a wild turkey from the brush, and it took flight sounding like a helicopter.  I’m used to seeing turkeys standing in the middle of the road stopping traffic , but it’s been a while since I’ve stumbled across one in a wooded setting. 
We also hiked past an old farm from the late 1800’s that I believe they have turned into some sort of museum.  It reminded me a bit of the Norlands Living History farm near my hometown in Maine, where they maintain an operating farm using only methods and equipment from the 1800’s as an educational and historical venue.  Immediately adjacent to the trail was an old 1800’s schoolhouse that was filled with desks. There was a sign that we were welcome to come in, and there was also trail Magic inside.  Sure enough there were two bins, one with some random equipment and first aid supplies, and another with an assortment of trail food items.  Since I was already heavily loaded with food from yesterday’s shopping, I only took one item, a hostess snowball, colored green for St. Patty’s day.  Since we are only about ten days removed from the wearing of the green, and those things have enough preservatives to survive nuclear winter, I figured I could probably go ahead and indulge.  Combined with the honeybun from this morning, I was loaded with all sorts of good hiking fuel. Shortly thereafter, we passed an Alpaca farm which does double duty as a hiker hostel.  I believe that Sim and Atticus both stayed there last night. 
Soon we came to the spot where the AT crosses Interatate 81 in Rural Retreat, VA.  Here we caught back up with DL, who had stayed at different spots than us for the past couple nights.  DL gets much of his resupply mailed to him in boxes to various spots, so he gets off trail more than I do to get his stuff, but we then often get synced back up again, and that was the case today.  Nav, DL, and I were hopeful that at least one of the two restaurants at this interchange would be open for lunch, but alas both were closed on a Monday.   So, in true dirtbag hiker mode, we ate gas station pizza inside the Sunoco at the interchange, and I topped it off with an ice cream sandwich. I had a pretty easy afternoon of 8 miles remaining, so I set off at a fairly relaxed pace, while Nav set off a bit faster so that he could get his remaining 14 done.  DL had stayed behind as he was still figuring out what his afternoon plans looked like. 
Shortly after noontime, I passed a major milestone: One Quarter of the way complete with this journey. I was quite pumped up, and I can’t believe that it’s already 25% over. 
Sometime after passing the milestone, while I was waking alone, I did run into one southbound hiker, and we chatted for a bit. His name was Doo-Frame, and it turns out he was from Maine.  He said he was in the banking industry, but I sensed that maybe he had run into some sort of trouble.   Just a hunch.  He said he was hiking to a town named Zihuatanejo, which I didn’t remember seeing on the AT maps, but maybe mine are outdated.  Anyway, he made an odd comment to me as he departed, when he said “get busy hiking or get busy dying”.   Interesting guy. 
Anyway, DL caught up to me in the early afternoon, and he decided that he was going to camp in the same site as me, so we continued on together for most of the next couple hours.  We hit a couple surprisingly steep inclines, given the relatively low elevation of the area, and also traversed across some quite scenic pastureland. The crowing roosters and baying hound dogs seemed almost like an audible caricature of rural life, but it definitely fit the scene.  We arrived at our intended tentsite, near Reed Creek, and it was a great little spot with plenty of space for multiple tents.  I was able to have the simple pleasure of plunging my tired feet into the cold stream for a bit, and it felt great.   As we were getting set up, the Nomads arrived, and one other couple out section hiking joined as well.  Food was eaten, food bags were hung, and hiker midnight descended.","Merry Inn in Marion
",Reed Creek Tentsite,"Mar 27, Mon",18.20
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661431,"I had a very peaceful wake up at our collection of sites by the stream. It was a pretty relaxed pack up process and there was just enough chill in the air to require gloves, but not enough that it was uncomfortable. The nomads and DL both got out of camp before me, and I started walking at 7:30.  I immediately began a 1000 foot ascent, but it had good footing and my legs felt fresh so it was actually a nice start to the day to get warm.  I then descended down into a gorgeous little farming valley.  I had caught up with the nomads by this point, so we were chatting as we crossed through the pasture land of this beautiful spot.  
As has been common around here, we had several fences that had to be negotiated. Some of them have gates, but many of them have one of various forms of ladders to get up and over barbed wire and down the other side.  Walking 2200 miles isn’t enough, so we have to inject some jungle gym elements into the game.
The nomads were stopping at a local hostel in order to do some slack packing, so I continued on on my own. I reached the Knot Maul shelter at about 11 o’clock, and it had a nice clean picnic table so I had myself a quick lunch.  
As an aside, I am terrible at having the correct amount of food in my backpack for my intended time on trail. I am constantly over packing which means I am carrying several pounds too much of food. I am working to get this more closely dialed in this week, but we shall see what happens. I believe that I am not visiting another town until Saturday, however I do pass by one local limited grocery store on Thursday, so there will be some resupply then. Today again had a very reasonable mileage day planned with about 18 miles, and so I was not in any particular hurry as I worked my way down from the shelter after lunch. I saw a couple deer just off trail, which the first one since the Smokies.  On my way down the hill, I saw Sim heading uphill southbound at a very rapid pace. As I approached him I said hello, but he had a very determined look on his face, and said to me “I am running a Trail marathon today“ and he continued on his way. I knew from a text that I had received earlier this morning that Sim and Navigator were both planning a 26 mile Slack pack southbound today, but I did not realize Sim was planning to run it not hike it. I later found out that the hostel where he stayed last night had been keeping track of fastest known times for that 26 mile stretch, and Sim was out to do it in less than six hours. Good luck, Sim, I hope you made it.  
Soon I reached Lick Creek, which required wading through knee deep water. When I arrived at the shore, I encountered a southbound through hiker named Leif, who had just recently resumed his southbound hike after getting off trail in November due to cold weather. We chatted for quite some time, and he seemed like a really good guy. Good luck Leif in your next four weeks of hiking I’m sure you will get the trail completed. I peeled off my trail runners, and put on my crocs, and waded across the river without incident.  Just as I reached the far shore, the nomads caught up to me, having left most of their belongings at the hostel a few miles back and they were hustling along on a slack pack. They also got across the river with no problem, and then DL arrived as well. DL does not carry crocs or any other camp shoes with him, so I offered to toss mine from the far side of the river to his side of the river so that he could have good  footing on the Rocky River bottom without getting his trail runners wet.  After evaluating the strike zone on the opposite side, I went into my wind up and delivered a fine strike with croc number one. I then shook off the signal for a fastball from the catcher, and I delivered a croc curveball. Unfortunately, it was a hanging curve, and it struck an overhanging branch on the far side of the river, and plopped into the water. The croc started floating down river, however DL who already had one shoe off stepped into the river and saved it from floating to TN. So at the end of the day, my well intended croc plan unfortunately only saved him one wet shoe, not two.  
The nomads and DL were both slack packing and so they set off at a faster pace than me, since I was carrying my full pack this afternoon. The walk through the woods after the river was actually quite peaceful, and I was enjoying the solitude. At one dirt road crossing, there was a small bit of trail magic. It came in two forms. The first was just a simple trashcan so that I could jettison the wrappers and other detritus that had been accumulating since I departed the hostel a couple days ago. There was a sign that indicated the local trail maintenance club maintained the garbage can, and just this simple act is actually quite helpful because quite a lot of garbage gets generated each day of backpacking, and of course you have to pack out whatever you create so that you are not littering the landscape. The second part of the magic was that there was two 1L bottles of propel sports drink, and I gladly drank one of them. The rest of the afternoon had a major uphill climb for me. A 2200 foot ascent of Chestnut Knob wrung the energy out of my legs, but I kept on chugging.  On the way up, I ran into Nav, who was working through his 26 mile southbound slackpack.  That may be the last time that I see him for a while, because he is now almost 15 miles ahead of me on trail, and it’s doubtful that I will do 15 miles more than him over the next several days.  The last 1/3 of the ascent of the knob traversed over a long grassy slope, with great views off to the east. The ridge that I was traversing was pretty much paralleling another ridge about 10 miles across the valley. I finally reached the summit of the 4400 foot knob, And at the top was a pretty unique shelter, that was a converted fire wardens cabin from many years ago. The shelter is made entirely of stone, and is enclosed on all four sides. The inside had quite a number of bunks where you could shelter for the night. There was also an absolutely incredible view off to the north down into a farming valley below.  I briefly thought about staying here for the night, rather than my intended campsite another mile down the trail, however it is supposed to be below freezing tonight, and I decided that I would rather be down in the gap several hundred feet in elevation below the summit for this evening.  
I bid adieu to the summit, and quickly descended down into Walker gap, where I found a fantastic campsite a couple hundred yards down a blue-blazed trail. I set up my tent while there was still a few hours of sunlight left, and enjoyed the tranquility of my own campsite. Upon reflection, I believe that this is the first night in about four weeks that I have solo camped on the trail. I enjoy having company at campsites and hostels, but it is also a nice change of pace to have a night of solitude. I cooked up my meal and then cleaned up, hung my beer bag and it was time to hit the sack.","Reed Creek Tentsite
",Walker Gap,"Mar 28, Tue",18.80
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661432,"For the first time in a few weeks, I woke to complete stillness. The tent site that I had chosen was quiet other than the rustling of wind through the trees. It had rained for just a very brief period last night, and then dropped well below freezing, so the raindrops on my tent had frozen into little rain pellets. When I packed up my tent it was actually quite easy to shake off all the ice pellets into a cool little cascade. 
I had again not planned a super high mileage day, only 17.5 miles, so I was not in a major rush to get out of camp this morning. I made up a hot breakfast, probably one of my last since I used the last oatmeal packets and I probably won’t buy any more. The morning started off with a nice ridge walk, although the footing was a bit difficult since it was mostly very sharp irregular rocks for several miles. Every so often I could see down one side of the ridge or the other into the valleys below. 
The first person I encountered on the trail was Townward, an incredibly ambitious guy who is working on his calendar year triple crown of hiking. The triple crown of hiking is when somebody over some period of time completes the Appalachian Trail, the continental divide trail, and the Pacific crest Trail. Most people spread this out over a several year period or even a lifetime.  This guy was one of the very few who are trying to get it done in one calendar year.   Yikes.  He is on Day 24 of his AT hike, and I am on Day 40, so you can imagine the daily miles that he is cranking in pursuit of his goal. Good luck to him! For the whole morning, even though I was probably a mile away, and 1000 ft in elevation higher, I could hear cows from the valley below bellowing to their colleagues in the pasture. I stopped at a nice brook which, as is often the case in this part of the country, was housed in a rhododendron thicket since they love the watery environment. 
A quick aside for an environmental request: today I passed by the third deflated Mylar balloon that I have seen on this trip.  It was not in a spot where I could easily grab it and pack it out, so it will just sit there as a pink and silver reminder that those things don’t just evaporate when you let them go in the sky.  I know it’s fun to let them go, but maybe we could just hang onto them? Anyway, enough tree-hugging for this post. I did also notice several electronic instruments scattered around the balloon site, and they had Chinese markings on them, I hope that doesn’t mean anything (kidding).  
I did run into DL and Mr Nomad headed southbound on a 21 mile slackpack from the hostel back near where I camped last night.   Seems like everyone around me is maximizing the slackpacking and minimizing the full-packing.  To each their own.  I was surprised that both Nomads were not out (mr and Mrs), and apparently Mrs Nomad is nursing some sort of shin splint issue and is going to take a few days off and then come back this fall and complete the segment.  Get better soon, Mrs Nomad!  It’s possible I might run into the Nomads off trail, since they apparently spend a lot of time in my new hometown where their daughter and granddaughter live.  Perhaps we shall someday have a meal together when we have all showered and are not wearing the same clothes for the 40th day in a row. Other than those couple encounters, it was a very quiet day on trail, that was capped off by perhaps the best campsite setting I have yet had the good fortune to occupy.  As I have probably mentioned in previous posts, I use the FarOut app a lot to plan logistics for the trip: where I’ll sleep, get water, resupply, etc.  The app also has loads of information about various points along the trail, like summits, and views, and road crossings, etc. Users of the app then post comments about the various waypoints, which 9 times out of ten are pretty helpful.  Yesterday, I was trying to figure out where I was going to end today’s hike, since I wanted something in the 16 to 20 mile range for the day. There were no shelters, or even specific tent site icons listed on the FarOut app, however if you read through the comments on some of the way points that were listed as “views” or even powerlines, you could find that there was actually tenting sites available near these waypoints. So I had tentatively picked one at approximately the 18 mile mark for the day which was listed as “view”, and I figured I would make the decision when I reached the location about how my legs were feeling, and the suitability of the site. I reached the site at 4:30, and while my legs and body felt fine and I could have done another few miles if needed, I doubted that I would find any finer site than this. This spectacular location sits on a outcrop protruding from the side of the ridge and offers sweeping views of the valley below and also to the parallel ridge line across the valley. It is also a westward facing view and I am currently seeing a spectacular sunset on this cloudless day. For the last 20 minutes or so I have been experimenting with my iPhone to see if I can capture better images during sunset at opportunities like these. The photo upload process for this trail journals app is a real pain in the neck, so I will probably only upload one of the photos. The sun finally finished its downward journey below the opposite ridge line, and it is time to close the tent door for the night.","Walker Gap
",Tentsite on bluff overlooking Bastian VA,"Mar 29, Wed",17.50
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661473,"After last nights sunset, and then seeing the sunrise paint the valley below in a new set of light,I started the day in a great mood.  I had also had a good restful sleep last night, but before I could fall asleep, I listened for quite some time to the real life version of the Midnight Howl scene from 101 Dalmatians.  The valley below me stretched for probably five miles or so (that I could see), and it seemed that every home down in the valley owned a dog that was kept outside.  First a dog in the southern end of the valley would start communicating, then dogs in the middle of the valley would respond, and soon the teams from northern end would also make their presence known.  It was mildly entertaining for a while, but eventually I tuned it out, and fell off to sleep on my rocky perch. Also fueling my good mood was the fact that I was going to have TWO town meals today. The first would be only 3 miles into my hike this morning at Brushy Mountain Outpost, a small convenience store/grille next to the trail. The second was coming from the my decision to stay in a hostel tonight, with the decision primarily influenced by the fact that this particular establishment, the Weary Feet hostel, served breakfast and dinner. Most hostels don’t serve any food, or occasionally will offer donuts and coffee for breakfast, but this one offered a full cooked dinner and also a cooked breakfast the next morning. So, with the visions of greasy roadside food dominating my thoughts, I quickly broke camp and hit the trail by 7 AM. It was an easy jaunt down to the outpost, and I found exactly what I was looking for: Two fresh made to order bacon egg and cheese biscuits paired with a steaming hot cup of coffee and some orange juice, perfection.  This joint catered to both the local clientele, but also were very hiker oriented as well. In addition to the electronics recharging station, there was a sign in sheet where you could put your trail name, and they also encouraged you to stick a push pin into a spot on the wall map corresponding to your hometown.  This concept is very prevalent on the trail where many businesses and even whole towns will have logs or maps or walls or bulletin boards where they encourage all the hikers to sign their name or create a piece of art or leave behind some memento. The convenience store part of the operation also had the usual hiker staples, tuna packets, Ramen, oatmeal, etc., however my backpack was relatively well stocked so the only thing other than my meals that I procured was some toilet paper. I know you couldn’t live without that information. As much as my taste buds and my stomach wanted me to stay and devour another three biscuits, my arteries and my desire to log some northbound miles overrode the impulse, and I was on my way. The next mile or so was actually a road walk as I crossed over interstate 77 and down a local access road. As I strolled across the overpass, and saw the dozens of 18 wheelers moving freight north and south along the interstate, it dawned on me that that’s exactly what I’m doing. So if your logistics needs require your parcel to absolutely positively arrive in Maine in roughly 5 to 7 months, and you don’t mind it smelling like hiker sweat, then I’m your man. Call 888 – RMBLR-FREIGHT. Disclaimer: if your parcel smells like food is inside, it will probably get eaten before it arrives in Maine. It was then back into the woods for a very dry walk for the next several hours. This was the first time where water access was actually something that I needed to plan. In general thus far along the trail there has been so many little mountain streams and springs that you could refill your water bottle at virtually any time. However today most of the day would be spent traversing across a ridge that apparently didn’t hold water so I needed to carry a full 2L, instead of the 1L that I normally carry. An extra 2 pounds in my pack, uggh.  Speaking of items in my backpack, today’s lineup of two town meals meant that there would be only one meal featuring one of the primary occupants of my backpack: Bars.  Back when I was in elementary school I entertained myself by playing on the monkey bars; when I was in my 20s I entertained myself by going to sports bars; now that I’m in my 50s I entertain myself by backpacking with a backpack full of food Bars. Feel free to choose your favorite preceding adjective, Energy, Cereal, Granola, Nutrition, Protein. Whatever.  They are all just Bars. If you ever wondered why your local grocery store seems to dedicate an entire annex to stocking a dizzying selection of these Bars, wonder no longer. It’s because hikers eat them by the dozens. I have now sampled and ever-expanding variety of these little rectangular calorie vehicles. While back in my non-trail life I might have a couple Cliff bars stocked in the kitchen cabinet for fueling a weekend bike ride, I am now operating in a completely different Bar universe.  I have now tasted probably 10 different Cliff Bar varieties, and also: Power bars, Luna bars, Kind bars, nature valley bars, cliff builder bars, Gatorade Bars,  and probably 20 other brands that I am forgetting. And let’s not forget the Original Gangster of Bars: the delightful Pop Tart. If you don’t think that the Pop Tart is a Bar, think again; Kellogg’s had this Bar thing figured out 75 years ago and owned the Bar market before Nature Valley and rest of them made it fancy and trendy.  I am clearly a bit obsessed with this Bar thing, because lately even when I see non-Bar food I think “well this is just a bar waiting to happen“. Bowl of cornflakes? Drizzle some honey on it, stomp on it with your foot, Boom, you got a Bar. Bag of trail mix in my backpack? Dump it into a rectangular mold, apply pressure, Boom, you got a Bar.  Some of my trail mates have been eating these things called “whole meal super cookies” (or something like that) which have like 800 calories and 1,000,000 grams of protein. And probably kale.  And it’s shaped like a cookie. Get that crap out of here! If I can’t identify it as something my mom or my grandmother made for me at some point in my life, it’s not a cookie…it’s a Bar.  And protein is not acceptable in cookies in anything other than trace amounts.   Just sugar, carbs, and love.  So, is that a long enough Bar rant for one post? I know where this is headed. My kids are probably going to get me a subscription to the Bar of the Month Club for Christmas.  Because it’s the gift that keeps on giving, Clark. End of rant, and back to our regularly scheduled hiker programming. The day was actually a really enjoyable 21 mile trot across these Appalachian ridge lines.  Pretty much the whole day, I had parallel ridge lines to my left (west) and my right (east) while I scooted along the middle one.  The grades were gentle, and the footing was really good, so the mileage flew by really fast.    I arrived at Weary Feet at 4:00, and found that DL and the Nomads were also spending the night there.   Mr Nomad and DL had both done some Slackpacking today, and were apparently no more than an hour ahead of me all day.  Mrs Nomad is still nursing her injury and took another zero day.  Also joining us as guests were OG and Townward.  I actually wrote about Townward in yesterday’s post: he is the one working on his calendar year Triple Crown.  Miss Julie, the owner of the hostel also had an interesting story.  She and her husband owned a farm outside Charlotte, NC until about 15 years ago, but it abutted I-85 right where NCDOT wanted to put an interchange, and there is no stopping progress in these fast expanding Southern cities.   So they sold, and bought a farm here, just up the road from the hostel.  Julie had her eye on the hostel property (it was previously an 82 acre farm) , and four years ago had the opportunity to buy it and turn it into the hostel she envisioned.  As a 120+ year old building, it definitely has a farmhouse vibe to it, and Julie has done a nice job of turning it into a welcoming destination for passing hikers.  She graciously welcomed us into the place for the night, and soon all six hikers were enjoying a nice home cooked southern meal to replace what was burned off during the day.   Everyone was finished up and back into bedrooms by 8-ish, and the house was quiet.","Tentsite on bluff overlooking Bastian VA

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661474,"I arose at Weary Feet with the smell of sausage cooking in the kitchen wafting upstairs to the bunk room where I slept.  It was a restful night, with just Townward and me in the bunk room that can sleep four. Julie had again whipped up a great home style meal, this time with eggs, sausage, and pancakes accompanied by coffee and fruit salad.  I ate my fill and, like the others, was ready to hit the trail.  DL and the Nomads were getting the logistics planned for another slack pack to the next hostel up the trail, with Mrs Nomad taking another injury day off.  OG was the first out the door, and I soon followed.  The morning stroll was pretty uneventful, with some nice rolling hills and cross-crossing a little local river delta a few times. The rest of the day got a bit more spunky.  I had a 1600 foot climb that needed to be accomplished, and unfortunately as expected, the rain forecast for the day started at the same time as my climb.  I had started the day in just shorts and t-shirt, and since I always sweat when have a climb of that magnitude, I had a choice, either stay in just a t-shirt and let the cold rain soak my upper body from the outside, or put on my rain jacket and soak my upper body from the inside by sweating even more heavily inside the jacket.  I started with the first option, but quickly had to switch over to the second since it was just a bit too cold to go without jacket.  So onward I went completing the climb and the remaining mileage of rolling hills.  All told I was in the steady rain for about four hours, and of course my jacket wetted out after that much time.  It still did its job of keeping the heat inside, though, and I was reasonably comfortable in the uncomfortable weather of the day.  As they say, “no rain, no pain, no Maine”.  My wet day finished at 3:00 when I arrived at Doc Knob shelter.  When I arrived, I was greeted by a SOBO hiker named Laptop.  He was finishing up his hike that he started last summer. He had come off trail in November due to injury, and has been back at it for about two weeks now.  Only about 600 more miles, Laptop…you got this.  He was just resting for a few minutes, and was soon headed down the trail to the Woods Hole hostel, where he will encounter DL the Nomads and OG, since that was their plan for the today.  Speaking of Woods Hole, we were having a rousing discussion about hostels and cults over dinner last night.  There is a famous location along the AT in Vermont called the Yellow Deli that is owned and operated by the 12 Tribes cult.  They apparently have a farm close by the deli that is home base for the cult, and visitors to the Deli are often invited over to the farm to see how they live and to hear their Message.  Every year there are several hikers who decide to hang up their trail runners and stay at the farm.  Yeah, I think I will just get my ham sandwich from the local Subway, and skip the spaceship to Venus. There was some discussion about whether the Woods Hole hostel here in this area is similarly run, but there were conflicting understandings about that one, so I will have to hear about the vibe there from DL and the Nomads when I next see them…(cue the ominous music)….if I see them again. As early as I ended up getting here to the shelter, I think I definitely could have pushed on and done a 27 mile day into Pearisburg. That said, I’m at peace with my decision, because it was kind of a crappy afternoon for hiking with the cold steady rain, and I would have been tempted to just zoom right out of town tomorrow morning, rather than taking the Nero that my body probably needs.  It will be a quick 9.5 miles into town tomorrow morning, and I can get my chores (resupply, laundry) done early, make some calls to family, and get a couple more town meals in my belly during my visit.  As a bonus here at the shelter, as of 7pm, I seem to have the shelter all to myself, which is an unexpected luxury!","Weary Feet Hostel

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661534,"The rain that fell all night provided excellent white noise for a pretty good night sleep at the shelter. I was really surprised that I had the entire shelter to myself, which is a first for this trip.  I was a bit torn about whether I wanted to get packed up and rolling down the trail.  I only had less than ten miles planned for the day, which would probably only take about four hours.  I could use pretty much any four hour window in the day to get it done, so the dilemma was to a) wait out the storm for the couple remaining hours it was forecasted to continue, or b) just get it done so that I could get into Pearisburg and get my town chores done and relax.  I went with B.  I hit the trail at 7 ish, but not without first hitting the ground.  I took one step outside the shelter, placed my foot on a wet wooden stairway, and in a nanosecond my feet were in the air, and I was going to ground.  Instinctually, I broke my fall by putting my hand out, which of course hit rock.  I was waiting for the crunch of a wrist bone, which fortunately did not come.  Just a few scrapes, which are par for the course, so then it was time to really get underway.   With it having been raining quite steadily for 18 hours or so, the trail was basically a river, so I splashed my way along making progress towards Pearisburg.  I didn’t seem to have all that much energy during the trod towards Pearisburg, but that was Ok, since I didn’t have too many miles planned.  I rolled into town a bit before noon and got settled into the motel I selected.  I met up with Navigator for a Chinese buffet lunch and replenished the calorie deficit. The rest of the afternoon was filled resupply activities at Food Lion and a local outfitter.  It felt really good to get that done, and then put my feet up for a couple hours while I made calls home to family.  I made arrangements with a few other hikers to get a shuttle tomorrow morning out to a trailhead 23 miles north of town, and we are going to southbound slackpack back into town.  I headed across the street to grab some Mexican food, and then it was time to shut it down for the night.","Docs Knob Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661778,"The shuttle picked me and four other hikers up at 7 this morning. Along for the ride were Navigator, Mr Nomad, Sim, and Smoking Boots.  A half hour later we were at the Big Stoney Creek Road trailhead where the wind was howling and snow was falling from the sky.    We all quickly got under way to get some warmth generated by our hiking.  Sim had decided to do another trail running slackpack, and he was off and literally running from the start.   I found out later that he completed 22 miles in three and a half hours…good grief.  The rest of us set off on a normal slackpack pace, which today would be about 3 miles per hour.  It had been a couple weeks since I had done a slackpack day, and it’s amazing how fast your feet fly when there are fifteen fewer pounds on your back.   Within the first hour or so, we ran into a northbound Atticus, who had stayed at a close by shelter for the night.   I’m guessing that I’ll probably run into him again later this week up the trail somewhere.The first part of the hike featured a pretty long climb, and so I was quickly warmed up and de-layered my clothes down to my normal shorts and t-shirt.   Once we crested the hill, however, the trail also turned direction, and suddenly we were back into the face of sustained 20 mph winds and mid thirties temperatures.  Time to put those layers right back on again.  In the late morning we reached a elevated stretch of meadow, and patrolling the meadow was a herd of about a dozen wild goats.  When I first encountered them, they were following a pair of northbound hikers, and as soon as we passed each other the goats followed me for a couple minutes, and when they figured out I wasn’t going to be handing them any food, they pretty much went back to doing what wild goats do (I guess) which was eating grass and butting their heads against trees.  I spent some time walking with Smoking Boots, and it was great to get to know him a bit. He is in his early 70’s but still moves like a much younger man.   He is from a small town in Maine just a bit Northwest of my hometown, and has worked in the forest product industry for his whole life, with much of his work as a laborer planting trees around the country.  He said he figures that he has planted about 800,000 trees in his lifetime.   Pretty cool! All of us were moving along at a good clip, and soon we were at Rice Field Shelter, where we ran into DL who was doing a regular northbound hike that day.  We all chatted a bit and figured out where everyone was planning to be for the next few days, and then we moved along.  I saw my first snake of the hike in the afternoon, and it calmly moved off the trail as I approached.   My only question for the day was whether I was going to tack on an extra 0.9 mile at the end to “officially” end todays hike at the point where I got off trail yesterday, or whether I was going skip it and head straight to the hotel.   Since my legs felt fresh at the end of 22 miles, I went ahead and did the extra 0.9 (as well as a mile walk to the hotel which doesn’t count in the mileage of the day).  I got cleaned up and Nav and I grabbed dinner at the Chinese buffet place again.   Tomorrow it’s back into the woods after two nights in town.","Pearisburg

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661779,"The shuttle to take us back out to Big Stoney Creek was picking us up at 8, which meant a) I had time to both grab breakfast from the Hardee’s, and 2) the Food Lion would be open so that I could grab a sandwich to toss in my pack for my first day’s lunch. When we got to the trailhead, fortunately it was a bit warmer than yesterday’s snowy wind, and I set off into the comfortable hiking weather.  Having a pack fully loaded with four days food the day after Slack-packing made me feel every single pound that was in that pack.   There is going to be some significant weight reduction from this pack at the end of the week when I get a visit from Mrs Rambler.  At about 10:30, I passed a southbound hiker who was bringing joyous news: Fresh Ground’s Leapfrog Cafe was at the next road junction doing Trail Magic!   I had not been fortunate enough to be at the right place at the right time for Fresh Ground in over a month.  My pace definitely quickened, and soon the smell of garlic bread on a grill was wafting towards me, and I had reached my little slice of Nirvana for the day.  He had cooked up a great spaghetti feed with meat sauce, and salad, and had a great selection of fresh fruits as well.  I sat and enjoyed the feed for quite a long time, as the chairs were comfortable, the food was fantastic, and the company of Nav, the Nomads, Sim, and Frodo was a lot of fun as well.  I had been waffling about whether I was maybe going to tack some additional mileage on my planned 16 mile day, but the hour plus that I spent with FG made the decision easy: it was going to be a shorter, somewhat relaxed day.  After the rough footing that made the morning’s hike a bit tough, the going got a little easier in the afternoon, and I was able to get into Laurel Creek Shelter by late afternoon. It was a really great spot next to (you guessed it) Laurel Creek, and there were lots of great tent sites as well.  Sim, Frodo, Nav and I were joined by a SOBO flip-flop hiker, and a section hiker from Charlotte named Andy.  We all talked about the  evolution of gear from big clunky steel and wool based stuff, to the modern materials that dominate the industry now.  Soon enough, hiker midnight and time to shut down.","Big Stoney Creek Trailhead 
",Laurel Creek Shelter ,"Apr 03, Mon",16.10
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661876,"The sunrise at Laurel Creek Shelter brought a really beautiful start to the day, and I was soon underway down the trail with an early start. After a short descent down from the creek area, I was soon passing through some pasture land, which the early morning sun had illuminated with some really fantastic lighting.  There were a number of cows out grazing, and several had calves under their wings.  The early morning sun angle made their shadows really elongated, and the effect as they meandered across their cafeteria was quite entertaining. Not too long after that, I crossed through a spot where the 300 year old Keffer Oak tree stood sentry.  Apparently this is the largest tree along the AT in the south. It was pretty darn massive.  I’m looking forward to seeing the world’s second largest ball for twine in the next couple days as well.  In the last few days, it feels like spring has finally started to arrive to the area, if by no other measure, than just the number of animals of various species that I am finally encountering. I stumbled across two good sized black snakes, several white tailed deer, turkeys, and a wide range of other birds throughout the day.  I could live without seeing the snakes that up close and personal, but I guess they are part of the package deal.   Eventually the warm morning turned into the first genuinely hot day of the trip thus far, and the heat, along with some pretty challenging terrain, and a long mileage day, definitely began to accumulate into a pretty physically exhausting day.   Late in the morning, I crossed through a long series of ledges along a ridge line that offered a great spot to stop and eat some lunch.   More often than not these days, I just eat while walking, because if I stop long enough for lunch, my legs stiffen up and I need to spend time stretching before I get moving again.  Today, however, the view was too nice to pass up, and the warm sun kept my legs from stiffening as well. When I descended down off the ridge, I needed to eventually cross over Craig Creek, which was a minor conundrum because the forest service had just closed  the bridge a few days earlier due to unsafe conditions of the deteriorating bridge.   My choices were to either wade across, go upstream or downstream to find a fallen log or some rocks for rock-hopping, or step over the recently installed wooden barrier at the end of the bridge and stride across the still-standing structure.   I’m not going to put in writing what I chose, but I can confirm that I did not get wet or injured, and it’s possible that there was a new set of footprints on the bridge.   After the creek, I had another 1500 foot climb to accomplish in the midday heat (it was now 80+ degrees), and I found myself longing for the sub-freezing degree days that had very recently been a part of the journey.   I guess I’m just tough to please.  Anyway, I tried to keep the water and Gatorade going into me at the same pace the sweat was leaving me, but I’m not sure I was winning that battle.  I finally crested the last major rise of the day, near a memorial for Audie Murphy, who was America’s most decorated WWII veteran, and unfortunately died in plane crash in 1971 near the summit. A long descent was bringing me close to being able to refill my water bottles, but as I reached the creek in the gap something even better than water presented itself: a trail angel named Jason was there offering trail Magic in the form of an ice cold Lagunitas IPA.   Wow, did that taste good at that moment.   Sim arrived in the gap at roughly the same time; he was so overheated that he passed up the beer offer, and just strode directly into the creek and sat himself down, clothes and all and submerged himself as best he could in the shallow water.  I still had a mile or so of uphill to go before the shelter, but that distance was quickly completed, and I arrived into Pickle Branch Shelter for the night.   Joining me were Sim, Navigator, Frodo, and Little Engine.   I found a great tent spot next to the stream, and the water was deep enough that I could rinse some of the dirt and sweat off before getting settled in. After cooking and dining with the gang, I was ready for a very early bedtime after a long, hot, and exhausting day.","Laurel Creek Shelter 
",Pickle Branch Shelter,"Apr 04, Tue",22.70
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661878,"In theory today was going to be a great day of hiking.  I had a 17 mile day planned, with roughly 4300 feet of elevation gain.  At this point in the hike, that’s pretty much an average day of work, not too easy, not too difficult. In addition, I was going to be crossing over two of Virginia’s three “triple crown “ peaks: Dragon’s Tooth and McAffee Knob.   I got rolling out of the tentsite and onto the trail after a good night’s sleep, but still somewhat feeling the effects of yesterday’s efforts.  When I say “in theory” above, what I did not account for was the triple whammy of difficult footing, high heat, and constant swarming gnats all day.   Dragon’s tooth was the first climb of the day, and while the total elevation and steepness were very reasonable, the footing was quite technical the whole way up, and made for very slow going.  About a half mile short of the Tooth, I also had to pause and detour after a large snake was coiled up, and rattling and hissing at me from the spot he claimed in the middle of the trail.  I decided to let him own that particular patch of dirt, and I bushwhacked my way around him, and continued heading towards the Tooth.  Upon finally reaching the interesting formation, I paused for a short period and took some photos of the impressive set of rocks.  Unfortunately, I could not stand to pause in one spot for more than a moment or two, because the attacks from the gnats were well coordinated and continuous.  Maybe I read the wrong children’s books , but I thought dragons breathed fire, not gnats. After taking a photo or two I hustled on out of there to hopefully get into a gnat no-fly zone somewhere down the mountain.  The first mile of descent was probably the most challenging descent on the AT thus far, and required a lot of scrambling and rock hopping.  After running out of water in between available water sources yesterday, I was carrying a full load of water today, which added that much more weight to my pack.   I have already started doing the mental math on how much weight is going to be removed from my pack later this week when I send some cold weather gear home, and I was certainly wishing that I had ditched that stuff a few days earlier.  Even by mid morning it was almost 80 degrees, so this was going to be another day of struggling through the heat.   With all the pauses to cool off and ingest water, my pace was really slow for the day.  I descended down to a nice pasture area, and I enjoyed the brief walk through its rolling terrain.  Soon the tilt of the land pointed upwards again, and I ascended to a ridge where I moved across a series of small rollers.   I then descended down to a small local highway, where I could have walked a few tenths of a mile down the road to a grocery store / deli to get a lunch and some other foods, but I already had too much food in my pack, so I stayed on trail and didn’t bother with the side trip. As the afternoon progressed, I approached McAffee Knob’s ascent trail.  This knob is arguably the most photographed spot along the entire AT, and it is a huge draw for day hikers. Even on this mid-week day, there was probably 20 cars in the parking lot that I crossed to begin my climb.   The well-worn approach trail had much more predictable footing than the trails from earlier in the day, but it was still a fairly steep stretch, so the summit would need to be earned.   There were dozens of day hikers descending down the trail, so I was hopeful that the summit would not be completely overrun with people when I arrived.   Sure enough when I finally reached the knob there were just two other people, a mom and her teenage son.   The views were fantastic on this clear day, and we took turns taking each other’s photos standing on the famous cliff.  Unfortunately, the gnats were just as bad on McAffee as they were earlier in day at Dragons Tooth.  I would have loved to have stayed there for a couple hours since I only had a short descent down to the shelter remaining for the day, but the gnats unfortunately chased me out of there after 10 minutes or so.  I reached the shelter pretty quickly, and it was a well developed area that included bear boxes and a massive tenting area.  I chatted with a couple ladies from Annapolis who were section hiking, and I worked through my food bag to get some calories in me after a long exhausting day.  Frodo, Nav, and Little Engine arrived an hour or so later, and shortly thereafter I shut it down for the night","Pickle Branch Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661929,"I had been looking forward for this day for a couple weeks now: my wife Kristin was coming out to meet me in Daleville, and I would be taking my first day off the trail tomorrow (Friday).  I had a manageable 15 mile stretch to get into town, but it was going to be another unseasonably hot day to work through.I was hoping to get out of camp extra early so that I could get down to Daleville, where Kristin was picking me up, as early as possible, but for first time on trail, I actually slept until 7:00…I must have been pretty exhausted from the prior day’s hike.  I was out of camp by 7:45 and rolling down the trail.I was soon climbing the gradual ascent to the third of the Virginia triple crown: Tinker Cliffs.   I was quickly up to the cliff area, and this was by far my favorite of the three crowns, and one of my favorite spots along the entire trail thus far.   The trail brought me right along the edge of the series of cliffs, and the cool breeze of the early morning kept the gnats away and kept me really comfortable. The view was immense, and the cliffs stretched for a good quarter mile allowing slightly different angles of the view for a good long stretch of walking. For the rest of the morning and early afternoon I was walking mostly along a ridge line, circling the town of Daleville. I could see the retail area where I was going to meet Kristin, but I still had five hours or so of hiking to get there. The footing was a bit rough, making it somewhat slow going but the grade was reasonable. With this being the third hot day in a row I could definitely feel that my energy level was getting pretty run down. I was attempting to put as much water and Gatorade into me as possible, but I know that I was running at a pretty significant hydration deficit. After crossing through two separate powerline cuts, both with good views into the surrounding region, I finally started the descent down into Daleville. When I got close to town I was able to reach Kristin on the phone and asked her to have large quantities of cold drinks when I arrived. I reached our meeting space at 1:30, a retail complex 1/10 of a mile from the trail head. I made it as far as the sidewalk of the fast food restaurant at the entrance of the plaza, and decided it was time to sit down in the shade and let cold Coca-Cola come to me. Kristin pulled in to the parking space moments later, and I was never so happy. It was great to see her after seven weeks on the trail. As an added bonus, my golden retriever was also in the car and so I got lots of attention from her as well. Kristin was pretty shocked to see how much weight was gone from my frame, as she had never seen me add anything less than 200 pounds previously in our 30+ years together. She hauled out the Coca-Cola‘s and ice that she had stopped just moments ago to grab, and I was soon putting ice cold liquid into my body that was demanding it. The retail plaza also had a barbecue restaurant, with outdoor seating, which was perfect for a smelly hiker and a dog to inhabit. We were the only people sitting outside and thus had the area to ourselves. I ordered a huge hamburger and some sides, and began what would hopefully be two days of replenishing town food.  It was a fantastic start to my downtime. We closed out the tab and then headed off to get checked into the hotel. A long hot shower was wonderfully rejuvenating.  I needed to run a couple quick errands, the first of which was to go get a haircut.  I entered this journey thinking that I would go with the shaggy hiker trash look for the hike, but the heat of the last few days have convinced me that returning to and even doubling down on my normal short haircut is the way to go.  I exited the Great Clips with much more aerodynamic styling that will allow me to efficiently slice through the wind as a I tromp through the hills.  Then it was over to Best Buy to see if I could find a lighter weight wall plug to mate with the extended battery that I carry for extended phone charge.  I selected a device, and will be giving it a trial run this evening.  Worst case, if it does not work, I can go back tomorrow and try again.  Then it was back to the hotel for a bit more relaxation, before we headed out to grab a bite at another local chain restaurant.   It was pretty quiet on a Thursday night, but that was ok, because we were not looking for a lot of hubbub.   Soon hiker midnight had arrived, and it was time to shut down.","Campbell Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661932,"What a perfect, much needed, day! After a restful night in a hotel bed, I hit the all you can eat breakfast buffet at the Hampton Inn (which was surprisingly good) and continued chipping away at my calorie deficit. It was a bit of a gloomy day outside, but that was not going to prevent us from relaxing and enjoying Roanoke. After giving the dog some exercise around the hotel area, we decided to venture into downtown Roanoke and see what the city had to offer. It is a great little city! There was a very nicely maintained downtown section with a lot to offer. First we hit Mast General store, an interesting combination of an old timey general store and an LL Bean. They had everything from Penny candy and games for kids to outerwear and dressy clothes. We wondered about around for a bit however did not purchase anything. Almost an hour had elapsed since I finished eating at the all you can eat buffet, so it was time to get more food. We stopped at a wonderful pastry shop and enjoyed an almond croissant and a chocolate raspberry croissant along with drinks. We then meandered along the sidewalks of Roanoke‘s downtown, and eventually decided to go visit the VA transportation museum. This was a cool set up, in a converted railyard, with an impressive number of old railway engines, classic cars, greyhound buses, stage coaches, fire engines, and all manner of human transport. Since it had started to rain outside we were very happy to wander around inside this sprawling building and engage with the various museum artifacts. After a couple hours of enjoying the museum, we wandered back outside and headed back into the downtown area. Again, with two or more hours having elapsed since food intake I needed to get back on it, so we hit the On The Rise Bread Company, a wonderful bricked space in the middle of downtown where I enjoyed the great club sandwich on fresh made bread.  We then headed down the street to the Walkabout outfitters, and browsed for a couple items that I wanted to mix into my backpack collection. There was a Talking Heads song playing when I walked in and coincidentally I had just watched a TH concert movie (stop making sense) last night before bed for the first time in a number of years,. I chatted with the store manager for a bit and we were both excited that the Talking Heads would be re-releasing this movie with new footage later this summer. We continued our tour of downtown and saw some nice outdoor markets, although the day’s weather really didn’t encourage lingering about, so we meandered over to an indoor market space and browsed for a bit before deciding that we should head back and check in on our dog back at the hotel. I then needed to run some errands, including returning the charger I had bought at Best Buy yesterday, since it turned out to not be compatible with the battery I had purchased a few weeks ago.  I ended up buying a new battery pack, with a built-in wall charger, to work my way around the whole problem. My other battery pack will be sent home with Kristin. I then ran back out to DaleVille, to return a pair of shorts to the outfitter, and to do a quick resupply food shopping trip at the Kroger there. It was great to hit a grocery store with massive selection, like a Kroger, however I was still pretty limited as to what can go into the backpack, so it ended up being pretty much the same purchases I would’ve made at a smaller local grocery store. While there, I ran into Frodo who was doing his resupply shopping. Since I had a car, I offered to give him a ride back to the trail head, but he had some other errands to do there before returning so we parted ways. It was then back to the hotel for an afternoon of being lazy and laying around. We hit a local chain restaurant for dinner, with a full rack of ribs being the centerpoint of my feast. My zero day then drew to a close, and it was time to start thinking about the miles that I was planning to accomplish for the next few days. I am so thankful that Kristin made the 3 hour drive up here from our home and that we were able to reconnect and spend some time together. It won’t be quite as long of a separation until the next time we see each other, as I will be getting off trail for a few days in early May to attend our son’s graduation. Seeing family, both the two legged and four-legged variety, is a huge morale boost and I feel like I have 10X the amount of energy after the last day and a half than I did when I came off trail on Thursday afternoon.  It will be a bummer to say goodbye tomorrow, but nonetheless I want to continue this trek northward","Daleville and Roanoke

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662025,"The sun rose, and it was time to say goodbye to my family and to the cushy hotel life of the past 40 hours. We packed up, and I hit the breakfast buffet for a second morning, and we loaded up to leave Roanoke. A quick 10 minute ride back to Daleville had me at the trail head by 7:30 in the morning. I said goodbye to Kristin and Carrie, and I started on my 1 mile full pack load jaunt. I had arranged with some other hikers that today I would slack pack 20 miles southbound, however I needed to first get to the hostel where the others were staying which required just the short 1 mile hike. When I arrived at the hostel the others were still eating the hostel breakfast, which gave me time to unload the stuff out of my pack that I would not need that day.Soon we were all loaded in a van (not down by the river) and headed to the day’s trailhead at Bear Wallow Gap.  Navigator and the Nomads were doing the same route as me today, and we all got underway from the gap at roughly 9:00.  Today was the first day where the AT was paralleling and sometimes cross-crossing the Blue Ridge Parkway, which is a scenic vehicle route through the mountains of the area.   It was a pleasant hike, with really well maintained trail surfaces.  In fact, we encountered a group of three trail volunteers who were clearing debris out of the various water diversion channels that are often cut into trails to prevent erosion.  It was a pretty uneventful hike, with Navigator and I making pretty short work of the 22 miles.  Along the way, we did pass a sign that indicated that we are 1/3 done with the trail, which is pretty cool.When I got back to the hostel it was time for a shower in the outdoor shower (not as bad as it sounds), and then I joined Hero, Fearless, and Nav for dinner at a local tap room.  It was great getting to know Hero and Fearless a bit. Fearless is battling MS, and went from being hospitalized with essentially no lower body movement to now attempting a through hike.  She is pretty impressive.  Hero is her buddy from their college days, and he is semi-sponsored in this trip, since his employer makes private label freeze dried foods.  They developed a brand “Fearless Fuel” that is geared toward minimizing the inflammatory ingredients that can cause MS to re-flare, while still delivering all the calories, carbs, and proteins that through hikers need.  They are eating their own branded stuff the whole trip and blogging about it for Hero’s employer.   While we were at the tap room, we decided to play a game of pool, and we had a lot of laughs while doing so.  Thank God I never needed to make money playing that game…I’m terrible.I did want to make note of the gear changes I made while on my zero day:Deleted: fleece jacket; winter hiking pants; belt; gloves; hat; compass; stuff sack; Anker battery pack; heavy duty wall charger; glide. Added: summer hiking pants; shorts; battery/plug combo. I believe that I took 3-4 pounds out of the pack, which was very much needed.","Daleville Roanoke

We hung out and had lunch with him, and then headed on down the trail.  We had a very manageable 15 miler planned, and I was beginning to think that I might want to push a bit further for some extra miles tonight depending upon how I felt when I reached the planned shelter.  Sure enough, we reached the shelter at a decent hour, and I was feeling strong, but then something happened to make me stay put right there: Fresh Ground was at a parking lot a five minute walk from the shelter and was going to serve both dinner AND breakfast to us shelter dwellers. Score!  There was a pretty sizable crowd at this shelter, partially drawn by fresh Ground.  They included: the Nomads, Nav, Fizziks, Little Engine, Dozer, Door Dash, and Zolo.  FG put on a great feast, with Chicken Soup that had massive chunks of chicken, stir fry, grilled cheese sandwiches made with Ciabatta bread, and salad.  OMG, so good.  Since nobody had any additional mileage to do, we all hung around the van for quite a long time and had some good laughs.  After we had been there for quite a while, Frodo came sprinting out of the woods.  He had decided to cancel his plans for hanging out at the river, since a two-fer FG feed was happening. Too funny.  Soon everyone trickled back to the shelter/tentsite and things quieted down for everyone to get some shut-eye and dream of the breakfast that FG would be feeding us in the morning.","Bear Wallow Gap

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662088,"There is nothing better than waking up in a tent in the woods and having the smell of pancakes being cooked by someone else wafting through the air.  As planned, Fresh Ground stuck around the area, and all the folks who enjoyed dinner last night were able to get a second bite of the apple (literally and figuratively).  He cooked us up blueberry pancakes, breakfast burritos with eggs, sausage and fixings, and had plenty of coffee and fresh fruit.  Again, the fact that this guy does not ask for anything in return, and dedicates half his year to these feeds is just amazing.  I know that I will be donating on day one of the annual fundraiser next year.  For the hiking today, I had a 20 miler planned into Glasgow, VA, where I would resupply and have a hostel night.  Nav, Dozer and Door Dash were all planning the same thing.  After feasting on FG‘s breakfast, it was time to pack up and hit the trail.  The first big climb of the day had me climbing a bit more than 1000 feet to the summit of Apple Orchard Mountain, which had an open grassy top with great views off to the west.  Also on top was a satellite station of some sort, which looks out of place in the wilderness. I spent the next several hours descending 3500 feet, with occasional bumps back upwards.  I eventually descended down into the valley where the James River makes its meandering journey towards Richmond and the ocean beyond.  A couple miles before my endpoint, I ran into an older coulee who were out for a day hike.  They had traveled in from a couple hours away, and were very interested in the concept of thru hiking.  After chatting for. Hit, it was time to push onwards, as I had arranged a shuttle to the hostel.  I crossed the James on a REALLY long footbridge.  The bridge was over 1000 feet long, which makes it the longest footbridge in the entire AT. Nav and I got down to the trailhead at roughly the same time and got shuttled into Stanimals hostel in Glasgow.  The one restaurant in town was closed on Mondays, so the caretaker of the hostel cooked up spaghetti and meat sauce for us, which was nice.  We also made a run over to the Dollar General and the local grocery store to get supplies for the next few days on trail.  It seemed like it was a quiet little town without a lot going on.  We arranged for a Slackpacking shuttle for tomorrow morning, and then hit the sack in the bunk room.","Cornelius Creek Shelter 
",Stanimals- Glasgow ,"Apr 10, Mon",20.10
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662110,"There were only two of us in a five-person bunk room at Stanimals last night, so I slept pretty restfully. I had arranged for a 22 mile slackpack today, and also doing the same thing were Navigator, Dozer, and Door Dash.  We were shuttled out to the spot where the trail crosses Highway 60, and the four of us set out for our southbound journey of the day.  With no weight on our backs, and perfect hiking conditions, the four of us were flying down the trail, averaging close to 3.5 mph most of the morning.  I got a chance to know Dozer and Door Dash a bit on the hike, which is always an integral part of the journey (at least in my opinion). The two of them have been hiking together for most of the last month or so, after starting in Georgia a day or two apart.  That is a pretty similar story with Navigator and I, two folks who end up having roughly the same speed on trail and plan to stop at roughly the same places most nights.  Dozer is retired from a career in technology, capped by a late career stint as a professor of mechanical engineering at Duke.  Door Dash is recently retired from a career in the Coast Guard, one of our outstanding servicemen who started his career as an enlisted man, and then working his way up to earn a commission and was second in command of a detachment based out of Puerto Rico.   He has settled in PR, but is wandering the earth extensively since retirement, hitting the AT after spending 6 months or so living in and touring Indonesia.   Both were good down-to-earth guys which is pretty typical of what I’m finding on trail.  We all took a short break for lunch in a nice little spruce forest area where a hiker had arranged the fallen cones to signify the 800 mile marker for northbound hikers.   It feels pretty good to have 800 down….”only” another 1400 to go! Later in the day we bumped into a group of six southbound section hikers who were from a hiking club in the NY/NJ area.  Door Dash recognized one of them as a person who posts a lot of YouTube videos, so they had quite a prolonged chat.  We passed by the Lynchburg reservoir, which was tucked into a beautiful little hollow and provided some nice scenery. As is often the case, we had been advised that the cell reception near our finish line for the day was not very strong, so we needed to arrange our shuttle from the top of a ridge 5 miles from the end. We were on track for a 4:30 finish, but the shuttle was not going to be able to be there until 5:00, so the last five miles, I eased back on the throttle quite a bit, and strolled down through the remaining descent back into the James River valley where we had finished the prior day.  We had some cool stream crossings on well-built footbridges, and I took the time to enjoy the sounds and sights of the rapids cascading down through the area. When we got back to Stanimals for our second night, we found that it was now a packed house, with the Nomads and Daddy Llama joining us, along with Dirty, a young and fast northbounder, Bill, a flip flopper who had just started on trail four days earlier, and SallyMander who was out doing a section hike.  DL, Bill, Dozer and Door Dash joined Nav and I for a walk down to Scotto’s, the local restaurant that had been closed the night before.  Cheesesteaks and/or pizzas were consumed by most of us, and several of us also ordered an extra cold sub to put in the pack for tomorrow’s lunch. The town of Glasgow also operates a free hiker shelter tucked in behind the restaurant, and I had briefly considered staying there before deciding on the hostel.  We walked by it, and I’m glad I’m doing the hostel, since the shelter seemed to be occupied not so much by hikers but more by semi permanent residents who were having hard times, which is not really the scene I was seeking.  I headed back to the hostel and shut it down for the night.","Stanimals- Glasgow

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662112,"After spending the night with four guys jammed into a bunk room and having one of them delivering some major snoring noise, I awoke without nearly enough sleep. Since I have been staying at these hiker hostels more often than I originally envisioned, it has been interesting to me how wide the variation between them has turned out to be. They are all priced relatively the same: usually $30 plus or minus 5 gets you a shared “bunk” room, and $60 plus or minus 10 gets you a “private “ space of some sort.  The variability comes in the ancillary “stuff” that makes or breaks the stay.  Since I spent a lot of my pre-trail corporate life traveling the country and the world and staying in hotels, it never really occurred to me that you might need to check whether the place you are staying has indoor plumbing or whether you would be squatting in an outhouse.   Or whether the advertised shower would be a “normal” indoor shower or whether you would need to stand under a bucket in 20 degree weather to get cleaned up. Even the spaciousness of the bunk room is a huge variable. Sometimes the bunks are in a converted garden shed (like the kind you might buy at Home Depot), or they could be in a massive second floor bedroom with 10 foot ceilings.   In the garden shed category, there might be only be two beds, or you might be sharing the shed with three other hikers jammed into four bunks.  Food is another variable.  The default food situation is that there is no food included, but you have access to a kitchen with pots and pans to cook something for yourself.   Others will include a box of pancake mix for you to whip up a little something before you head back to the trail.   Still others use breakfast as a way to differentiate themselves and declare “the best breakfast on the entire AT” as a way to draw in hikers.   Finally, the staffing also has huge variability.  In some places, the hostel owner lives there and clearly has a pride and passion for opening their home to wayward hikers.  In others, the owner has installed a caretaker that may live there, and these folks can be all over the spectrum. With two nights at Stanimals Glasgow under my belt, the overall experience was on the lower end of the spectrum.   The house was pretty shabby, the tiny bunk bedroom had five bunks jammed into it, and the in-house caretaker was pretty liquored up the first night, and was annoying as hell the other night (there was no subject on which he was not an expert, and would inject himself constantly into conversations between guests).  On the plus side, they did cook pancakes for us both mornings, and as mentioned yesterday, they cooked up some pasta the first night because all the food options in town were closed on Monday.  The shuttle driver (another critical ancillary service that I didn’t mention above) was super nice and helpful, but I doubt he will be there for long because he had to take his marching orders from the drunk caretaker.  Spotter the shuttle driver took us back out to Highway 60, and we got our hike underway. I was a bit worried that the 22 miles yesterday and the projected heat for today might make the hike a bit of a draining slog, but it turned out that my legs felt fresh, and there was a nice cool breeze up in the hills, so the conditions felt great too.  We had an immediate 2000 foot climb to get to our second-to-last 4000 footer of the Southern Appalachians, but with a nice steady pace, it felt like I was on top in no time whatsoever.  The next few miles I was walking across some bald grassy summits which provided great views.  I encountered a SOBO section hiker who had done the whole trail back in 2014.  He was now volunteering at the ATC museum in PA which I did not know even existed.  I might try to stop there when I walk through the area in a few weeks.  I also ran into a family who was out enjoying the beautiful morning, and they were very interested in asking lots of questions about the whole through hiking concept.  I also stopped to eat some lunch up on these balds and really enjoyed my time there.  The destination for the night was the Priest shelter which is situated on Priest Mountain.  There is a tradition that in the shelter logbook, you should confess your sins against the Appalachian Trail. Some of them were pretty hilarious.   I entered in my transgressions, which shall remain confidential between me and the Holy AT Father, Benton McKaye.  It was just Nav and I at this shelter for the evening, and after some calls to family members, I shut it down at hiker midnight.","Highway 60

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662115,"Today was brutal.  Probably my toughest day on trail.  It was only 17 miles, but the elevation changes and the heat absolutely crushed me.  The day started nice enough, as I had a few hundred feet to reach the Priest summit and catch the early morning illumination.  It was still reasonably cool, and it was an enjoyable view.  Then came an uninterrupted 3000 foot descent off the Priest, which tends to chew up my legs.  That was then immediately followed by a 3000 foot ascent of Three Ridges mountain in the rising heat of the late morning and early afternoon.   I was drinking (and carrying) a ton of water to stay ahead of dehydration, but I don’t think I was winning that battle.  I must have stopped ten times on the upper part of Three Ridges to let my body catch up with what my ego thought I should be accomplishing. I finally dragged my exhausted self into a tentsite in the late afternoon and called it a day.  Navigator pushed on for an extra three miles, but I wasn’t going to get that done today.   After setting up my tent and getting some dinner into me, a SOBO hiker named Birch came in and set up as well.  She was on break between finishing medical school at Columbia and starting residency at UNC Chapel Hill hospital. She had completed the northern half of the trail a few years back, and was now stitching together sections of the southern half as her schedule allows.  Good luck in your medical career, Birch!  I soon shut it down, and hoped that tomorrow’s 17 was going to be easier than today’s 17!","Priest Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662139,"What a difference a day makes!  After getting my butt kicked by the trail all day yesterday, today’s mileage (which coincidentally was exactly the same as yesterday) absolutely flew by.  The trail was super flat (relatively), and the temps were a bit cooler than yesterday as well.  I stopped at several of the plentiful water crossings and splashed water onto my heated self, which is one of the basic pleasures in the middle of a day of hiking.  I had reached the end of my planned 17 miles by 12:45, and felt like I could have probably chewed up another 10 if I needed to. But, the plan called for a resupply and hostel stay in Waynesboro VA, so that’s what I did.  I had caught back up to Nav throughout the morning and we arrived at the shuttle pickup point just a few minutes apart. That was good, since we were splitting a room at the hostel in Waynesboro.  We were both curious what this hostel experience would hold for us, since this one was the second Stanimals hostel of the week (Glasgow Stanimals was the other).  So far, it seems like this one is quite a bit better.
 I got showered up and put clothes into the laundry and then headed over to the Cook Out across the street to get a first dose of town food into me.   It was my first time at this fast food establishment, and the food was fine, maybe half a notch higher than McDonalds, but their milkshakes were awesome.  Mint chocolate chip.  Bueno!!  Since tomorrow was only going to be a half day, I decided to leave resupply chores until morning, and I spent the late afternoon making phone calls and catching up on journal entries. I was splitting a double room with Navigator, and it was huge, even having a couch in the room.   The common areas were also quite comfortable, so relaxation came easily. We also ran into Lucky Moon. LM had been a Trail Angel who had fed me twice in two days back about a month ago.  She was now out doing her own hike, a southbound section of about 100 miles or so.  It was great to see her again.
Nav and I decided to go over to a local brew-pub for dinner and a beer, and grabbed a shuttle over there.  It was Basic City Brewing, and the place was huge.  They had taken over an old historic factory space (Virginia Metalworks), and had brewing operations, massive seating area, an arcade space with pool tables, skee ball, and shuffleboard, and had even recently converted some of the space into an event venue. There was a country and western act that was going to be playing that night, so the place was packed.   The beer was really good, the food was mediocre and overpriced, and the space was pretty cool.  All in all a reasonably good choice for the night.  For reasons that I won’t put in writing, we decided to walk back to the hostel instead of using Stanimal’s shuttle, and once back at the hostel it was time to shut it down after a really enjoyable day.","Tentsite at mile 847

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662312,"When I arose this morning, it seemed really odd that I wasn’t hustling to get packed up and rolling out the door, but my plan called for hanging out in Waynesboro until a bit after noontime today.  So….I went downstairs and get started on my third of five town meals planned for my 24 hours in town.  The Stanimals staff was cooking up pancakes, so I was able to enjoy flapjacks and coffee and watch the other hikers hustle out the door.  I relaxed for a bit and then headed over to the Hardee’s for breakfast sandwiches (meal 4 of 5). While out, I also scooted over to the WalMart for a resupply run.   They had most of what I wanted but I also ended up going into the adjacent Dollar General, the Family Dollar, and the CVS to get some cliff bars.  Don’t ask.  Back at the hostel, I spent some more downtime catching up on journals (I’m now only a day behind….WooHooo!) and generally staying off my feet.  Finally as my last act in Waynesboro, can you guess?…..I got meal number 5 of 5, yet another run over to Cook Out. I’m thinking that I probably took in something like 6 or 7000 calories in the 24 hour period….and I probably could have kept going.  If nothing else, I think I’m pretty well rehydrated after drinking liquids nonstop during my time in town.
It was then time to shuttle the ten minutes back to the trailhead.  We were joined in the SUV by two other hikers who were being shuttled to a different trailhead.  The shuttle driver insisted that even though we had three grown men jammed in the back seat, we had to also accommodate his 70 pound dog in the back seat with us.  Ahhh, hostels.
For the hike itself, I was now entering Shenandoah National Park right at the point where the Blue Ridge Parkway turns into Skyline Drive.  There was a kiosk where you are required to write yourself a permit for your visit.  It seemed like a pretty anachronistic exercise to literally hand-write a piece of paper in triplicate (actual old school carbon paper included) indicating where you would be hanging out during your time in the park.  I have pretty much no idea where I will be sleeping for the five or six nights it takes me I get though SNP, but I dutifully filled in the form.  Hopefully the Vogons put similar energy into processing the form appropriately back at the home office.
That task complete, I set out on the short 8 mile journey of the afternoon.  It was a pleasant hike across gently rolling hills, and I crossed Skyline Drive a couple times.  Calf Mountain had a nice grassy top, and there were great views out to the surrounding mountaintops.
When I rolled into Calf Mountain Shelter, there were three other hikers there: Bass Clef from western MA was here on vacation doing a section hike; Beez was on Day 1B if his NOBo through hike.  He had done Springer to Fontana in January during a vacation, and was now commencing a flip flop hike to get the rest of the trail this spring and summer.  Good luck, Beez! There was another hiker whose name I did not get. We all chatted about the typical trail stuff, while we ate our meals. I had brought a sandwich from Walmart, so I didn’t even have to turn on my stove. I was just about to hit my tent for the night when a troop of about a dozen Boy Scouts arrived in camp. I figured I might be in for a noisy night, but the boys were all very well behaved and got their tents set up and food cooked relatively quickly. By 9 o’clock or so, the camp was quiet and I drifted off to sleep","Waynesboro VA

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662313,"Today was my longest hike of the trip so far, which is a big deal to me, however first I must address an Unsolved Mystery: The Case Of The Magically Materializing M&Ms.
When I arose this morning, like I do most mornings I put on my crocs for my time while I was wandering around the campsite. I got all of my clothes and tent and sleeping system packed up into my backpack, and I was ready to strap my crocs onto my backpack and put on my trail runners for the day. When I lifted my first trail runner, something didn’t feel right. There was a rattling inside. Not the normal sound you hear from a pair of trail runners. In fact I don’t remember my trail runners ever making any sound. No Rattles, no Hums, no nothing.   I switched on my headlamp so that I could see better, and I found that there was almost 20 M&Ms in my shoe. I know that I didn’t put them there. I know that they were not there last night. So somehow M&Ms magically materialized in my trail runners. I can only think of three possible explanations: First, the M&M commercials are real, and those suckers actually have shoes and hands and can walk and dance and I just didn’t see it happen. They had a parade, and it ended in my shoes.  Second, one of the other hikers in the campsite was playing some sort of prank that I don’t understand. Third, a mouse or chipmunk was raiding somebody’s unattended food bag, found a stash of M&Ms, and decided that my shoe looked like a good burrow that he might be able to use. Since I did in fact see a mouse near my tent this morning, and since it didn’t seem like any of those Boy Scouts or other hikers were the type to play practical jokes, and because my family would find a straight jacket for me if I declared my belief in cartoon characters, I am going to go with the mouse theory. I will never know for sure, so the Calf Mountain Shelter will forever remain a bit of a mystery for me. Cue the spooky music for the closing credits.
After shaking off the M&M trauma, I got out of camp very early this morning because I wanted to do most of my hiking in the coolness of the early morning just in case it got hot again up in the mountains. It was a really nice start to the day; the terrain was much like it was yesterday, relatively flat and plenty of good footing which made for very fast walking. I had 10 miles completed by 10 in the morning and reached the Dundo picnic area 15 miles into the hike at about noon time.  Last night Nav and I had talked about options for where we might want to stop for this evening, and it was either tenting at a stealth site or pushing 26+ miles to the Pinefield shelter. Since the miles had accumulated quite easily this morning and there was only 11 miles left to reach the shelter, I pretty much decided at lunchtime that it was going to be a 26 mile day. While I was at the picnic area, I chatted with a very nice couple from New Brunswick Canada who were down here camping in the national park for two weeks and doing 10 to 12 mile day hikes every day. They offered me some trail magic in the form of a tasty collection of nuts that they were carrying, and they also offered that if I want to stop in to visit at their campground in a couple days they would be more than happy to host us for dinner. While the trail does go right by the campground, I think the timing is not going to work to take them up on their offer since we will probably pass by in the late morning while they are out doing their hiking. The picnic area offered valuable trail amenities: there was a privy, there were trash cans to throw away garbage, and there were spigots for refilling water bottles. After a nice long lunch featuring a spam sandwich and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, it was time to get moving.
While the hiking was definitely enjoyable, there really wasn’t that much in the way of great views for the day. The one exception was a set of cliffs and ledges that I encountered in the mid afternoon. Navigator, who had left camp later than me this morning, finally caught up as I was chilling at these ledges. We walked the remaining four or 5 miles to the shelter together and talked about our logistics plans for the next couple days. We arrived at the shelter at 5 o’clock, and surprisingly we were the only occupants of the shelter site. I set up my tent, and Navigator decided to stay in the shelter. We were both pumped to have completed our longest day on trail thus far….26 miles. Even over easy terrain 26 miles is something to be celebrated in my book.  We both cooked up our food, and then called it a night.","Calf Mountain Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662315,"I only had a short day planned for today, since I was going into Elkton Va for resupply, which was only 11 trail miles down the road. I did want to get into town early enough so that I could get two town meals (lunch and dinner), so I was not going to hang around the shelter for long this morning. It had rained overnight a couple times, but had stopped early enough that my tent was mostly dry by the morning. Still, since I wasn’t super rushed this morning, I did hang the tent up for a few minutes before packing to let it dry more.  The temps had cooled considerably overnight, and it was actually a bit chilly this morning. I had a morning pop tart, finished packing, and was on trail by 7:00.With the rain from last night, I could definitely tell that spring is advancing northward and into the higher elevations.  The last few days, the trail has mostly been at elevations well below 3000 feet, and there is much more undergrowth that is starting to fill in, and the buds on the trees are actually starting to look like leaves.  With the rain, the grasses and leaves looked that much more full this morning. The white dogwoods also are now quite visible as well. While yesterday’s hike was extremely flat, there were a few more sizable bumps along today’s route…nothing really major, but there was one 1200 foot rise and another couple that were between 700-900.  Still, much more docile that what had been the norm in the early weeks of the hike.   I had gotten out of camp 15 minutes earlier than Navigator, and we were going to be sharing the same shuttle later this morning, so I slowed my pace a bit and stopped for a bit longer than normal at some of the spots that offered a view.  This was also self serving, since my legs were feeling a bit sluggish after yesterday’s 26 miler.Speaking of views, they are fewer and further between in this section of trail.  Due to the lower elevation of the hills, and the filling in of the leaves in the trees, the famous “Green Tunnel “ of the AT is starting to form. With today being a Monday, there were fewer day hikers out and about, but we did run into a group of four folks heading southbound on a flip flop hike.  This group was interesting in that two of the four were kids. I didn’t get the exact ages, but Stinkbug and Butterfly appeared to probably be 8 and 10 years old. Their mom, Cat Herder, and their friend Wildflower both were in great spirits and excited to be on their journey.  They had started in Harpers Ferry which is about 120 miles north, and they were going as far as Damascus before they were going to flip up to Katahdin and head southward.  What a great adventure for the two young ones!Speaking of flip flops, I have been noticing that for the past couple weeks, I am encountering fewer and fewer NOBO’s that I have not met before.  For the first several weeks, I was passing slower NOBO’s pretty much every day, and was occasionally getting passed by faster NOBO’s. And when I say “NOBO” , I mean those hikers who are doing the traditional start from Springer Mountain.  I am still hiking around a small group of NOBOs that I have already encountered…Nav is obviously on very much the same pace as me; Frodo is typically just a half day ahead or behind me; DL and the Nomads are a day or two behind; and Sim and Atticus are a day or two ahead.  But I think there are fewer and fewer “new” NOBOs for me to encounter, because there are not that many still ahead of me, and the faster ones behind me started so much later than me that there is a sizable gap to make up before they pass me by. Interestingly, I recently heard that Townward, the guy from a few days back who is doing a calendar year triple crown, had already reached Harpers Ferry, the approximate mid point of the trail, and that he was only the 29th NOBO of the year to register at the ATC station there.   I think he was given hiker tag number ~1000 (confirm) at Springer, meaning that he had passed by more than 900 people between Springer and Harpers.  I have tag number 282, and I will be interested to see what my Harpers Ferry number is when I arrive in a few days.  Most of the “new” people that I now encounter are doing one of million variants of flip-flop hikes.  In other words, they start somewhere in the middle of the trail, hike for a bunch of miles, and then fly/drive to a different point on the trail to complete the journey.  I was originally planning to do a flip flop myself, but the timing worked best for me to do a traditional NOBO hike, and I’m honesty glad that I did.  I am liking the feel of one continuous journey, with the finish at the summit of Katahdin later this summer.  Hopefully!!Nav and I got to the highway 33 crossing at 11:30 and got a shuttle down into Elkton.  There is a great outfitter there, Appalachian Trail Outfitters.  We arrived at ATO, and standing in front of the store was Frodo!  We actually thought he was behind us, but he apparently got ahead of us while we were in Waynesboro a couple days ago. We all caught up for a few minutes and then went inside. Wow! This outfitter has by far the most hiker friendly setup I have yet seen on trail.  In the back of the store, you pass through a curtain, and there is a whole hiker “lounge” with sofas, television, laundry, kitchen and a shower! The outfitter is partnered with the hostel, and the clerk at the outfitter was going to give us a ride to the hostel when the outfitter closed at 6pm, so we had the whole afternoon to kill.We left our stuff at ATO, and popped over to a pizza place and chowed down heartily.    Both types of music, Country AND Western were playing on the restaurant’s sound system.  Across the street was a Dollar General, so we also got most of our resupply completed as well. In the upcoming miles, we will continue to be in Shenandoah NP, and will be passing by a number of “waysides” which supposedly have a good supply of hiker foods, but I have seen conflicting reports on whether they are open this early in the season, so I’m not 100% banking on them for my food supply.  We all then went back to the outfitter and hung out in the lounge for a couple hours.  Showering and laundry were accomplished, and a trio of non-smelly hikers hung out and watched Hustle (with Adam Sandler) for a couple hours.  Frodo was then off to his hostel (different one than mine), and Nav and I headed to a burger place down the street for round two of town food.  The food was fine, and I also got a milkshake, which was just OK….twice the price and not as good as the ones at Cook Out a few days ago.   The ATO clerk, Esther, then shuttled us back to the hostel. The hostel is actually the home of Esther and her parents.  It’s a beautiful property, probably 10 acres off the end of a winding dirt road.  They have a two-story out-building which they have converted into a hostel.  It was probably the nicest property and building in which I have stayed on the trip.  It’s their first season of attempting to be a hostel, so Nav and I were only the 8th and 9th guests that they have ever had.  There was a massive game room with foosball and air hockey on the second floor, along with 16 deer heads mounted on the wall, a stuffed Black Bear, and two black bear rugs.  The place was perfectly decorated, and you could tell that they put a lot into the space. Unfortunately there are few things they will have to get ironed out if they really want to be a hostel: there was no Wi-Fi or cell service, no kitchen, and no refrigerator, and no easy way to get the 20 minutes back into town for shopping and/or restaurants.  Anyway, they were a super nice family, and for sure will get it figured out.  Since it was already 7:00 when I got there, I only ended up being conscious on their property for about 90 minutes before it was sleep time.","Pinefield Hut

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662436,"I had a good night sleep at the Skyline Bunkhouse hostel, and as a nice treat, the owner Chris cooked up a sausage egg and cheese bagel sandwich which was tasty.  She makes the sausage herself.  Our shuttle guy Wayne picked us up at 7:30, and we were at the trailhead by 8:00.
The terrain continued to be quite easy compared to earlier parts of the trail, and the miles accumulated very quickly.  I made the first stop of the day at Lewis Mountain Campground, which had a camp store that was open.  As I walked through the campground It looked like the place was probably only 20% occupied.  Not surprising on a Tuesday this early in the season.  The guy running the store was friendly and helpful, and I hung out there for a half hour or so, fueling up with another egg sandwich, and some other foods.  As a side note to my New England friends and family, all the retail and food services operations in SNP are operated by Delaware North, the same company that owns the Boston Garden and the Boston Bruins.  Looking forward to seeing the Bruins continue to steamroll towards the Stanley Cup in the next few weeks!! After the very relaxing rest stop, it was time to continue rolling down the well maintained trail.   In fact, I encountered a pair of trail maintainer volunteers from Potomac Trail Club out working on a section of trail this morning.  They do a great job with maintenance around here, especially with this section being located in SNP, it gets a lot of foot traffic.   I thanked the folks for doing the volunteer work, and then continued on down the trail. The terrain continued being quite moderate, and soon I had reached a SNP wayside, Big Meadows.   Here I ran into three other hikers: Cruz, who lives in the same town and on the same street as some family members of my wife, and who is doing big miles every day by starting hiking at 4:00 in the morning; and Camel and Scapegoat, two brothers from CA who have already hiked the PCT and CDT.  The two brothers are also doing huge miles…they started 10 days after I did.  All three were super friendly and we hung out and chatted for a while.  They were planning to all push on another nine miles down the trail to the one restaurant in SNP that was open, and I was tempted to join them, but that was more mileage than I really wanted to take on today.   Navigator and I stayed at Big Meadows for close to an hour fueling up on the convenience store foods that they had available.  The wayside was also adjacent to Big Meadows Campground.   The Canadian couple we met a couple days ago had invited us to stop by their site At BMC when we passed through, so we walked over to their spot, but they were still out hiking for the day, so we left a note and continued along the trail.  We only had another three miles, and we arrived at Rock Spring Shelter by late afternoon.   It was a very picturesque shelter site, and Nav and I were joined by two section hikers as the only four at the site for the night.  The two section hikers were both from MA, and one is currently a school guidance counselor at a high school in Maine, a bit south of my hometown. All in all, with the multiple stops during the day, and the relatively forgiving terrain, it was a pretty relaxed 20 mile day.","Elkton, Va

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662590,"I had a great night of sleep in my tent at  Rock Spring Shelter. The last couple weeks as I have waked further north into VA, I keep getting surprised by how close I am to population centers.  Several evenings, including last night, I enter my tent before it is even dark outside, and looking down into the valley that could be seen through the trees, it just seemed like empty woodlands.  However, when I step out of the tent later in the evening for a moment of relief, I suddenly see hundreds of lights illuminating the valley from homes and streets.  I’m guessing that this is probably going to be the norm as I continue moving north up the mid-Atlantic states, which are not exactly known for their desolate stretches of unpopulated areas.
I got up and rolling pretty early this morning, continuing my way northward through Shenandoah NP.  By 8am, I was passing by the Skyland area of SNP, and I saw the tents of Camel and Scapegoat set up not too far from the restaurant.  I’m guessing that they probably had a late dinner there last night, and are probably staying for the breakfast this morning.   The terrain ended up being quite a bit rockier than I had expected, and I was not making quite as good time through the section as I had thought I might. I stopped by Mary’s Rock in the late morning to eat a bit of lunch, but then pushed onward without hanging around for very long.  I knew that today was going to be a 23 miler, and that the forecast called for some pretty toasty temps in the afternoon.  That’s exactly what mother nature delivered, and the afternoon ended up being a bit of slog just to ensure that I reached the Elk Wallow wayside before they closed at 5.
It’s amazing how much of a motivator a cold drink and an ice cream sandwich can be on a hot day, and that was the primary thought keeping me pushing through the heat of the afternoon.   I reached the wayside at 4:15, and some wonderfully chilled sodas definitely were refreshing (or maybe I just have been programmed to believe that after having watched a billion Coke ads in my lifetime). It was then a steady parade of through hikers emerging from the woods to get the same refreshments that I did.  Navigator came first, with plenty of time, and shortly after him Camel did the same.  Camel told me that both his brother Scapegoat and Cruz were a ways behind, and it might be close to see if they made it before closing time.  Sure enough Cruz came hustling across the parking lot within a few minutes, but Scapegoat was not yet to be seen.  Camel was nice enough to go in and buy his brother some cold drinks, but just as the workers were about to lock the door, Scapegoat came sprinting out of the woods, dripping in sweat.  Even though it was technically a minute or two past closing, the nice gals who were staffing the wayside let him go in and make a couple extra purchases.  We all hung out at the wayside for another 45 minutes or so, having some good laughs about the day, and letting the food and drinks do their restorative work.
I was only planning to go about another mile to a stealth site just past the wayside, and Nav was doing the same.  The two brothers and Cruz were heading another few miles beyond there to a shelter.  I reached the stealth site in no time, and soon had my tent set up in a really cool spot underneath some pine trees.  It’s pretty rare that I’m sleeping near pines, as most of the trail has been passing through deciduous forest this far, so having a bed of soft noise-dampening needles under the tent rather than crunchy dead leaves, or just mud, was a really nice change of pace.  Since my belly was already full from the wayside, no cooking needed to occur, and I was able to relax and fall off to sleep after a pretty tough day of hiking.","Rock Spring Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662761,"I had a very manageable day planned for today, with a reward at the end in the form of a hostel night with the promise of a cleansing shower and a trip into town for some good food.  The only question was whether the terrain and the heat were going to make a bit more challenging than I had planned.  The answer in both accounts was fortunately, “no”.  I had a short climb in the morning up Hogback mountain, and got some nice views for my effort, but from there onward, the trail was both relatively flat and quite devoid of obstacles as well.  I got a nice sunrise view from a crossing of skyline drive. There was even a fair number of water crossings, so I could keep the amount of water I was carrying to a minimum.  And since I had gotten out of camp quite early, I got most of the mileage complete before the heat of the day really set in. Sometime in the late morning, I passed through the northern boundary of SNP, and for the first time in a few days, was no longer on National Park lands. I finished with a long descent down to US route 522 which is the highway into Front Royal.  The hostel for the night was right there by the highway, so no additional walking (or shuttling) was required.
This hostel was Mountain Home B&B and Hostel, and it’s definitely in the upper echelon of hostels that I have sampled along the trail.  I talked extensively with the owners while sipping a cold lemonade that they had squeezed. They had bought the place about 10 years ago when it was a dilapidated set of buildings on an overgrown property.  The poured a lot of money into the buildings, with the end result being a pair of structures that are true to their Civil War era time period, yet fitted out for modern living. The property is listed in the National Register of Historic Places , and they even have a diary from a young girl that was living on the property while the Civil War was raging around her.
After getting checked in, I got showered up, cooked up and ate a frozen pizza, and then Lisa the owner shuttled Nav and I the short distance into town.  The downtown area of Front Royal has a really cool vibe, with a lot of historic buildings and many businesses oriented towards visitors. We first stopped at the local outfitters which had one of the bigger inventories of goods that I have seen along the trail. I really didn’t need much there (navigator was grabbing some mountain house meals). The building which housed the outfitter also was home to a bake shop, and a restaurant/brewery. And one other really cool feature. Those three businesses had chipped in to convert a previously unused ~500 square-foot space into a Hiker “Basecamp“ which is free of charge to hikers. In the base camp there are laundry machines, showers, lockers to store your gear, sofas, and a hiker box. Again, all free of charge to hikers. I actually ran into the owner of the building who is also the owner of the restaurant/brewery, and she was very excited about the space, as her daughter had through hiked the trail two or three years ago, and provided a number of inputs into the details of the Basecamp. It’s a really fantastic resource for hikers, and I would encourage any hikers who might be reading this who are visiting in Front Royal to spend your outfitter dollars, your bakery dollars and your brewpub dollars at one of these three businesses because they are looking out for us.
So, with that in mind, Navigator and I proceeded into the Vibrissa brewpub, where we found Camel and Scapegoat. When we had last talked with them a day or so ago they had said they would probably stop at the basecamp so it wasn’t totally shocking to run into them here.  They were finishing their lunch, so Nav and I had a quick beer with them and then we needed to head a few blocks over to the grocery store for resupply.  With that chore completed, we went back to the brewpub, this time to get a meal. We had some tasty food, and made a couple calls, and then it was time to get shuttled back to the hostel.  Staying in the same building with us was Dr Who, a young guy from Delaware that was just starting his flip flop hike, and a section hiking couple, Jodi and Oliver, from MA. Jodi is planning to thru hike next year, and I have no doubt that she will successfully do the entire 2200 miles.  After some time chatting with all these folks we all headed off for bed.","Stealth Site - SNP

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662881,"So, you ask what’s the difference between a hostel and a B&B? One way to tell is your 6:30 AM experience.  If you walk into the kitchen, and the hungover caretaker hands you a box of Costco pancake mix and a spoon, you are in a hostel.   If, on the other hand, the Owners themselves lay out three types of fresh brewed coffee, serve up platters of freshly sliced fruits, offer juices and five selections of fresh cooked breakfast, all on nice china while engaging in interesting conversation, you are in a B&B.  Mountain Home is supposedly both, but the experience is wonderfully 100% B&B.  It was actually quite interesting to hear some of the details of how owners have to navigate the ever shifting county by county regulations that cover hotels, hostels, B&B’s and AirBnBs. After finishing up breakfast, I quickly got packed up and underway with a far heavier backpack than I needed to have.  I had significantly over purchased during yesterday’s supply run, and had enough food for probably six days when I only needed maybe three.  Oh well, time to start eating. My initial plan was to do a relatively short 15 mile day into Whiskey Hollow shelter, but the miles were flying by pretty easily in the morning.  I passed by the Ray’s Rhino tree, a wonderfully deformed tree that kinda looks like, yep, a rhinoceros.  I reached a nice stream which was only about a tenth of a mile before Whiskey Hollow shelter by early afternoon, and it seemed much too early to end the day.  My legs felt great, and of course my hiker brain wanted to push more miles, but my stomach was not feeling 100%, so it was decision time again.   Brain/Legs beat out Stomach on this one, and I decided to push another 8 miles to Rod Hollow.   Within about 20 minutes of that decision my stomach let me know that it was a sore loser, and wanted a recount in the recent election.  I’m pretty sure I was just a bit acidic from having had both an apple and an orange in short succession while walking briskly a couple hours prior, but whatever it was, it made for a less than enjoyable final few hours of the day.  I finally reached Rod Hollow in the late afternoon and was happy to have the day complete.   Nav was there, and shortly after I arrived, Camel and his brother Scapegoat came in as well.  There were several other hikers: most names I didn’t catch except for Bad Idea, who was an active duty Army officer out doing a section hike with his Swiss Mountain dog, Willow.  I cooked up dinner and chatted with the assembled group for quite a while.Just as I finished dinner, my phone rang with the best news of the week: my son had just accepted a job offer for employment in his chosen profession, and will start this spring a couple weeks after his impending college graduation.  Congratulations, Jason!!!Food bags were hung on the provided bear pole, which is a tall metal pole with prongs at the top where you can drape your food bag for the night out of reach (theoretically) of creatures small and large.  To get the bags up to the prongs, a long metal stick is provided, and you first drape your bag on the stick, and then raise the stick up to the top of the pole.  It’s not quite as complicated as getting a tin of Dapper Dan down from the top shelf of the Woolworths, but almost.  I then hit the tent, and allowed the soothing forest sounds of Airbus 320’s on final approach to Dulles lull me off to sleep.","Front Royal, VA

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662884,"I got a nice early start to the day, since I knew there was a line of thunderstorms that were inbound to the area that were going to arrive a bit before noontime.  There was a hostel at the ten mile mark for the day, and I wanted to reach it while still dry.  The trail had quite a bit of rockiness, making the pace a bit slower, but the elevation changes were still pretty moderate. A couple miles into the morning, I entered a stretch that is nicknamed the “roller coaster” because of its frequent sharp inclines and descents.  I personally didn’t think the bumps were any more significant than what I had been encountering all along, but it’s a cute nickname.This morning, however, I did get to celebrate crossing over a Big Round Number: the 1000 mile mark of the journey!  A southbound thru hiker that I met early on this trip and who was almost at the end of his 2200 mile journey told me that his best advice was “find reasons to celebrate….like every hundred mile mark, take a moment or two or ten”.  I like those words, and I did exactly that at this otherwise nondescript spot in the woods.  I’m pretty happy that my body is still intact and functioning after 1000 miles. I still have another 1200-ish to go, but I’m feeling great about having 1000 in the books already.On this particular Saturday morning, even though storms were inbound, there were dozens and dozens of day hikers out enjoying the trail.  One of the last set of hikers I encountered prior to reaching Bears Den hostel was a group of Boy Scouts that numbered well over 30.  Once I reached the hostel, I realized why.  This particular hostel is owned and operated by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, and the grounds are available for multiple uses, and on this particular day, there were 100 Boy Scouts with dozens of tents milling around the place for some type of outing.  While I am honestly happy that they had the opportunity to enjoy the location, since these young men and women will hopefully develop a great appreciation for these trails like I have, I wasn’t sure I wanted to stay there for the night with all the activity going on.  I was already planning that, if the line of storms was brief and cleared out by mid afternoon, I would push on a few miles to a tentsite, and this gave me a second reason to hope for that weather outcome.In the meantime, I was able to use the hostel shower to get cleaned up, and I decided to walk with Nav a half mile over to the Bear Chase brewery to get some food and a beverage.  This was by far my best decision of the week.  For some reason, I had thought this was a tiny little place, but when I got there just after opening (and just before the storms) there were already 100 people there, and the place was hopping.  A band was playing and people were having a great time indoors…especially once the skies opened up.  We ended up being joined by Bad Idea and his dog Willow, as they had left the shelter not long after I did.  I had a great time getting to know BI a bit better, and Willow was super-chill, enduring the dozens of people who stopped by to give some love to the 100 pound pup sitting in the middle of the space.   We were also later joined by three other section hikers, and then by a thru hiker from Luxembourg trail named Logan, and his partner, a woman trail named Squeaks who is from Wisconsin.  We all had a blast listening to the music, enjoying a couple beers, and being off trail for a couple hours when we would normally be making miles.The line of storms did in fact roll through in good haste, and the rain had stopped by late afternoon.   I decided that I was going to go ahead and hike another 3 miles or so to a tentsite that was listed in FarOut.  I went back to the hostel and gathered my stuff and moved on out.  The illumination in woods had a really interesting glow with the post-storm, early-evening light playing off the early-spring tree leaves and undergrowth that had been fattened up by the water dousing that they had just received.   Along the way to my tentsite, I passed by a sign indicating that I was leaving VA and entering WV.  Yee-hah! Another reason to celebrate.  I have been in VA, which is home to over a quarter of the trail’s miles, for quite a number of days, and State Lines, much like Big Round Numbers, are a good reason to celebrate.  I reached my planned site, and it was a great spot at the top of a hill near a communication tower that I had all to myself.  It was dark by the time I set up my tent, and so I closed the curtain on one of my best days on trail.","Rod Hollow Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662888,"Today was Harpers Ferry day for this NOBO hiker.  This small little town in WV is important for a few reasons. It has a ton of history, especially from the Civil War era.  The town is situated at the confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers, and had much strategic importance early in our country’s history, so quite a number of battles happened in the area.  For an AT thru-hiker, it is the psychological halfway point of the trail.  The actual halfway mark is another couple days north, but the Appalachian Trail Conservancy has a headquarters and visitor center here in town, and it’s tradition for hikers to stop in and register their progress on the hike, and to get a photo in front of the sign on the building.The hike this morning was honestly a little boring; it was probably because I was more focused on getting to HF rather than focusing on the trail itself during the morning, but overall it was a bit underwhelming.  When I got close to the Shenandoah river crossing though, the interest level picked up a bunch.  I first descended down into the river valley, with the roaring of the water getting ever closer.  I then popped out into the bridge crossing the river, with a cacophony of noise from both the river itself, but also a ton of traffic zipping back and forth across the bridge.   After getting across, there was immediately a sharp hill that needed to be ascended to get up to HF’s streets.  The ATC building is accessed by a side trail off the actual AT, and it first pops you out in the middle of the National Park Service’s Storer College, which has a really interesting history in its role of providing educational opportunities for freed slaves after the civil war.  This little corner of HF was one of just many that I want to come back and visit when I have more time post-trail.I continued onwards the additional block or two over to the ATC center, and it was abuzz with activity.  This weekend they had hosted the annual Flip Flop Festival, which draws a lot of the folks planning to do a flip flop hike (start in HF, hike north to ME, come back to HF by car, then hike south from HF to GA) into HF for the weekend and a mass start up the trail.  I hadn’t realized until a couple days ago that my current pace was putting me on a collision course with a bubble of new northbound hikers, which will probably create a bit of crowding at shelters, but there is nothing I can do but hope for the best.  Typically the new hikers (including me at the start of my hike) are quite a bit slower than the folks (like me now) who have had a few weeks to get their trail legs under them.  With that, I’m guessing that I will push through any bubble within a couple days or so. The visit to the ATC center was a welcome diversion, and I enjoyed seeing their exhibits, and looking through the photos of other hikers that have recently passed through.  I mentioned in one of my earliest entries that thru hikers carry a numbered tag which helps the ATC keep track of trail usage.  Mine is 282, meaning that I was the 282nd hiker to start a northbound hike from Amicalola Falls in GA in 2023.  According to the numbered photos in the ATC office, I am only the 50th northbound hiker to come through HF, so I guess I’m moving at a decent pace.  I hung around long enough to take in a couple refreshments, and charge my cell phone batteries, and while I was there, I felt a bit like a zoo exhibit.  The volunteer (a super nice and helpful guy by the way) working at the desk would welcome every visitor, and inevitably would mention that I was a thru hiker, which would then trigger a barrage of questions.  All the visitors were friendly folks, so I had no problem whatsoever engaging with them. After a while, it was time to move on. Navigator had arrived a half hour or so after me, and we were going to go grab some pizza before walking out of town.  By the time we had eaten our food, and stopped at an outfitter for a few resupply items, I had been in town for close to three hours and my motivation for continued forward movement was waning a bit. We started down the pathway leading out of town, and I additionally started feeling some digestive effects from the not-so-great pizza I head eaten.  With that combination of issues, I decided to calm it a day, and I pulled off into a motel for the evening that was just off the trail.","Tent site 1009.1
",Harpers Ferry - motel,"Apr 23, Sun",18.50
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663017,"I arose out of my cheap roadside motel ready to roll.  The shower last night, and a good night sleep in a bed had me feeling strong. I was ready to go before 6am, but I held off leaving until 6:00, hoping I could grab a breakfast sandwich from the convenience store across the street.  I showed up there at 6:10, and even though the opening hours sign said 6am, there was nobody home.  The thought of hanging around for an indeterminate amount of time so that a surly teenager could microwave me an egg sandwich did not seem particularly attractive, so I pulled out another energy bar from my food bag and marched onwards.I did almost immediately face another Trail Purity test. The road that the hotel was on was approximately a quarter mile from the Appalachian trail, and paralleling the Appalachian trail for about a mile and a half before they rejoined up ahead. I could either go back down to where I had gotten off the trail yesterday and walk the actual AT, or I could stay on the roadway and just join up in 2 miles. I chose the latter. I’m not pure. Forgive me Benton McKay. I immediately crossed under a super busy highway and then started climbing back up onto a ridge, pretty much the only significant climb in the entire state of Maryland from what I could tell on the trail map. But, it was early morning,my legs were fresh and I was feeling good and soon I was up on the ridge-top.  Navigator had stayed at a shelter up on the ridge last night, and did not get a very early start, so soon I connected up with him and we walked north together. The terrain was moderately rolling although fairly rocky under foot so I was able to maintain decent speed. Soon we were passing through a number of Civil War monuments, as there were many battles in this region, and there is a lot of history to be told. Similar to Harpers Ferry, I think I would like to come back here after my hiking is done and do a little bit of historical tourism. I stopped at one of the sites, a monument to a pair of generals (one from each side) that died in the same battle, and I ate my lunch. What better way to celebrate the Civil War then with a tunafish sandwich. While I was there, Camel and Scapegoat caught up with me. Apparently they had been in Harpers Ferry with a relative who had been visiting. They are throttling back a bit right now, because Camel’s wife is flying in from the west coast to visit with them on Saturday, and they were on pace to over shoot their planned meeting location. Otherwise those two speedsters would have left me in the dust two or three days ago.After chasing my tuna fish sandwich with an oh-so-tasty handful of trail mix, I was on my way as well. Since Maryland is a small state with a large population, it seems like their semi-rural areas need to serve a lot of purposes. The Appalachian Trail passed through several state parks with picnic pavilions and swimming pools and other infrastructure. I also had the opportunity to fill in my admittedly week grasp of US history, because the trail passed right through the Washington monument. No not that one. I did not suddenly veer 70 miles south east, but apparently there is an “original“ Washington monument up at the top of the hill in Maryland. The trail leading up to the monument had some nice interpretive signage about Washington’s life, capped by a nice stone mini tower at the top of the hill. I believe the structure did duty at one point as a signaling beacon of some sort but sometime in the 1800s, it was re-purposed as a Monument to George himself. At some point, folks down in DC way, decided that something a bit more grandiose was needed in the new capital city, so the monument that we know today as the Washington monument was erected. Anyway, enough about monuments to great Americans. As the day progressed, I passed by a steady stream of fresh faced northbound flip floppers who had started at Harpers Ferry this past weekend. Like me nine weeks ago, most were carrying too much weight in their backpack, and probably a little bit too much weight on their bodies. Give them another 2 to 4 weeks and they will be hardened trail walking machines heading towards Katahdin. I wasn’t 100% certain where I was going to finish for the day, there was a shelter that would have made it a low 20s mileage kind of day and a shelter that would’ve made it an almost 30 mile day, but I decided to split the difference and stopped at the Pogo memorial campsite, which made a 25 mile day. The campsite was carved into a fairly large swath of forest, and had several tent pads that volunteers had cleared out and leveled off. I cooked up my dinner and finished off a very satisfying day on the trail. I let the sounds of the woods send me off to sleep.","Harpers Ferry - motel

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663250,"For the last few days and for the next two or three days we are having an absolutely perfect stretch of weather for hiking. High 30s to low 40s first thing in the morning maxing out in the high 50s to low 60s in the afternoon with some mixed clouds and sun; just perfect for hiking. The weather is supposed to turn less favorable starting on Friday and lasting for three or four days. As such, I was hoping to make hay while the sun shines, and get in a lot of miles today.  For some reason, my legs and body did not agree with what my mind wanted to accomplish.  I’m not sure if it was from putting too few calories into my body or the wrong kind of calories into my body, or perhaps the moon was in retrograde while in the third house of Venus. Whatever the reason, I was just plain sluggish all day. It wasn’t that I wasn’t enjoying my hike, my legs were just not cranking out the miles at the speed and intensity that I had hoped. Oh well, that’s OK, I still moved northword 22 miles today and still enjoyed a great mix of solitude and camaraderie on the trail, and I’m still having the journey of a lifetime. Not every day is going to be perfect!The trail continued to be quite moderate as far as elevation change is concerned, however there were fairly long stretches of rocky footing that made for some slow going. I passed by some additional state park infrastructure, and finally hit the Mason Dixon line, finally leaving behind the land of “y’all“ and entering the land of “you guys“. As lunchtime approached, I was looking for a good spot to rest for a bit, and I knew the High Rocks Ledge area was coming up, which sounded perfect. As I got within about a quarter-mile of this feature, I was horrified and saddened to see that every other rock on the Appalachian trail had been tagged by graffiti artists. As I approached the high ridge rocks, it was like something out of a bad adaptation of Fantasia; this beautiful rock structure had been defaced with graffiti that had accumulated for probably 40 years. There was graffiti on the rocks, graffiti on the trees, graffiti on the ground, and trash strewn everywhere. I’m not sure what could be done to reverse this damage or stop it from spreading, and probably local town and forest officials have grappled with it for a while unsuccessfully. But it was really sad to see. I suppose, in some people’s opinion, the crappy collection of initials and other graffiti paint is a beautiful work of art, but to me it’s just a crime. Nonetheless, I did stop here for lunch and did my best to orient myself so that I could enjoy the spectacular view without having to take in the graffiti view. I also pulled my tent out of my bag, to let the morning’s ground condensation evaporate off in the bright sunshine. I am always amazed how quickly the tent dries when it’s spread in direct sun like that. It was probably less than five minutes and it was completely dry.After having my fill of lunch, I continued onwards.  It was a fairly steep and rocky descent off the ledge area, and it took a bit of concentration to stay upright.  It was an uneventful afternoon of hiking and I reached the Tumbling Run Shelter by late afternoon.  This was a very impressive shelter property, and it was obvious that the local trail club took a lot of pride in maintaining the facility for the hiking community.  Thanks again to all those volunteers!!  There were actually two separate shelters side by side, along with some very well graded tent sites.  I was glad that it was such a large site, because there were quite a few guests for the evening.  As mentioned a couple posts ago,  a lot of flip-flop hikers started from Harpers Ferry this past weekend, and there were many folks fitting that description this evening.  I had a nice conversation with a young lady from New Zealand who is over here for a 90 day sabbatical from her teaching job, and is doing as much of the northern section of the AT as possible during that time.  She was giving a great description of some of the adventure racing events that she and her friends were doing back home….kayaking, mountain biking, orienteering, and trail running all wrapped up in one package….sounds fun!  I also ran into Wildflower, who I met a couple weeks ago when she was hiking with her friend Cat Herder and Cat Herder’s kids Butterfly and Stink Bug.  Wildflower had sustained some leg injuries and was slowing down her pace pace in order to recover.   There was also a volunteer from the local club who was spending the night in camp, as he had been been out all day clearing brush from the trail up on the ridge.  Super nice guy.   He also advised us that we might want to sleep with our food this evening, since there was a particularly ingenious super raccoon in the area who had figured out how to shimmy up the bear poles, and defeat the baffle mechanism that had been installed to prevent access.  I need to see video of that. I’m picturing that Rocket from Guardians of the Galaxy must have McGivered up some apparatus to make it happen.  So for the first time in this trip, I snuggled up with my energy bars and tuna packets, and drifted off to sleep.","Pogo memorial tentsite

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663383,"I was trying to decide if todays entry was going to be a think piece about a mid level band struggling with their own limitations in the harsh face of stardom, but I instead decided to go with a description of my hiking day.The plan for today was to get to US route 30 sometime in the late morning and then go into Fayetteville PA for some supplies.  Depending upon how long that process took, I would decide how far I was going to push in the afternoon.  I broke camp and quietly got moving fairly early, before many hikers in the campsite were stirring.  The first several miles were very manageable, and I passed by Camel and Scapegoat who were packing up their tent site that was a couple miles past where I had stopped for the night. I reached the roadway that leads to Fayetteville by mid morning, and started walking/hitchhiking my way to town.After roughly 10 minutes of walking, I was picked up by Steve, a retired guy whose kids had been involved in scouting and enjoyed hiking the AT themselves. Steve drove me in to the local convenience store where I was going to resupply. This particular convenience store was a hikers paradise: there were hot prepared foods, tables at which to sit, Wi-Fi, recharging capability for my batteries, and a cornucopia of the staples I needed to refill my backpack. I lounged at the store for 90 minutes or so, made calls back home, packed my bag full of my purchases, and then set out hitchhiking/walking back to the trail head. This time it only took about five minutes, and Augustine, a local agricultural worker who had some history delivering blueberries from Maine down to the Mexico border, gave me a ride the short distance to the trail head. Thank you Steve and Augustine for making my day easier!With 3000+ calories of refuel in my system, including a tasty ice cream sandwich. my energy level was sky high, and the miles accumulated quickly.  I had one interesting encounter shortly after getting back on trail when I was overtaking a slower hiker from behind.  When this usually happens, I try to make enough noise with my trekking poles scraping across rocks as I approach so that I don’t startle anyone. However on this afternoon, apparently I didn’t make enough noise, because I scared the crap out of this guy that I approached from behind. I felt really bad about it, and I apologized, but he also seemed really annoyed. He said something about you should slap your poles together from behind, however I had done the equivalent of that and it had not worked. I am not sure what the right protocol is for approaching someone from behind like that, but usually I have no problems but this time it did not work. If anyone has any suggestions about the technique that I should be using in these instances, I am all ears.After an hour or so, I saw Camel and Scapegoat again, who were relaxing by a nice stream, taking a long lunch break. As mentioned before, they are “only“ doing 20 mile days this week because they are timing their arrival into a Duncannon to meet Camel‘s visiting wife. Along the way, I passed by the 1100 mile mark, and paused to snap a few pictures of the rocks spelling out 1100 that someone had arranged on the ground. Soon, and not surprisingly, the brothers caught up to me, and we walked the remaining miles of the day together chatting about trail life in general. These guys have done a ton of long-distance hiking, and Camel even had the opportunity to summit Kilimanjaro in Africa earlier this year. These two would be stopping out of the miles anyways, but they have added incentive since Camel is recently married and they are leaving for a delayed honeymoon in late June when his wife finishes her school teacher year. They are on schedule to finish the trail in well under four months, much faster than I could consider doing.As we crossed a roadway, I saw two familiar faces coming into view. Logan and Squeaks, the Luxembourg couple who I had met at the Bear Chase brewery a few days ago were coming up the road after blue blazing down to a nearby lake for a change of scenery. We chatted for a couple moments, and then resumed our trek for the afternoon. Soon the brothers and I reached Tom’s Run shelter, where there were only two other people currently occupying a massive, very well maintained tenting area. I got my tent set up, and about that time Logan and Squeaks arrived in camp as well, so I had plenty of company for dinner that evening. This shelter was also situated next to a flowing stream, so it was great to be able to plunge my feet into the cold water for a few minutes. After a nourishing dinner and some great conversation, I was definitely satisfied with a good day of work, and it was time to shut down.","Tumbling Run Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663526,"I knew that I had a deli coming at lunchtime today, so I left camp this morning with a spring in my step.  I ended up leaving at the same time as the two brothers, and we were walking together at a quick pace early in the morning.  After just a few minutes, we passed by a structure that marked the the halfway point of the hike. We had celebrated the real halfway mark of the hike yesterday, because the trail length gets modified every year, but they don’t move the marker every year.   But, it was a cool marker for us to use as a backdrop for a few pictures, and it made me reflect on how far I have come over the preceding 68 days.  It’s been a great journey so far, and I’m looking forward to the second half of the hike. We were soon descending down off the ridge, and passing through a set of cabins that lined the side of the trail.  I later found out that these cabins were part of Fort Michaux, which housed German and Japanese prisoners of war during WWII.   The descent dropped us into Pine Grove Furnace state park, which had a couple interesting elements. I first passed by the IronMasters Mansion Hotel, which is an old mansion from the steel making days that now operates as a hiker hostel.  I didn’t pop inside, but the outside looked pretty cool.  Right next to the mansion was the General Store. This store hosts a famous Challenge for thru hikers, called the Half Gallon Challenge, where if you can eat a half gallon of ice cream in less than an hour, you get some sort of momento. Unfortunately, as has been the case with many things along the trail, it was too early in the season for it to be open.  It was however, a good spot to take a break, and they had a good hiker box from which I was able to grab a granola bar.  Next, about 200 yards down the trail, was the Appalachian Trail Museum, but guess what…it wasn’t open, and it was locked, so I really don’t know what they had to offer inside. I continued on through the length of the huge state park, and t seemed like it would be a really nice spot to have a picnic on a summer day, with acres of flat grassy lawns and flat, paved walking trails that crisscrossed the space. As I walked this morning, I also had to work on finalizing my logistics for getting off trail next week.  I am taking my first multi-day zero of the hike to go to my son‘s college graduation, and figuring out exactly where I’m going to be located in order to figure out the car rental location has been top of mind. I ended up reserving at two different locations spread by about 75 trail miles. Right now, I think that I am going to be getting off trail in Port Clinton Pennsylvania and picking up a rental car in Hamburg Pennsylvania for the 10 hour drive south. As the morning progressed, my legs seemed to be a little bit heavy, and the two brothers buzzed right on past. By late morning, I was getting close to the grocery store/deli, and my pace quickened a tad. When I arrived at the store, not only were the brothers there but also two faces that I was not expecting: Navigator, who I had not seen in a couple days, and Cruz. There were a few other hikers there as well, some new faces who had recently started their journey at the midpoint of the hike. I quickly ordered a cheesesteak sub and also loaded up with some other goodies, and had a great 90 minute lunch break on their outdoor picnic tables ob a warm afternoon. Navigator headed out shortly after I arrived, but Camel, Scapegoat and Cruz and I all hung out for quite a while and had some good laughs. The cooler full of Häagen-Dazs ice cream was beckoning to me, so I quickly ingested a wonderful pint of butter pecan goodness. As much as I would have liked to stayed there for another few hours, I had miles to do.
I headed on down the trail, and then shortly had an interesting experience: I started hearing a helicopter off in the distance. That’s not a particularly notable thing, however the helicopter seemed to be hovering and really not moving anywhere. I couldn’t see it, because it was still quite a ways away through the trees, but I could definitely hear it. I wondered why it might be just hovering, so I pulled up Google maps to see if perhaps there was a small municipal airport close by: there wasn’t. I did see on the maps that there were some fields off in that direction, and I wondered if I was mis-hearing the noise and perhaps it was some farm equipment that just sounded like a helicopter. As I continued to progress closer, I determined it was definitely a helicopter, but I still did not know why. I was approaching a roadway, and I had a second thought: perhaps there was a bad automobile accident and the helicopter was there to transport injured victims. I soon reached the road, and I saw no evidence of an accident, and the helicopter sound was still a ways off through the trees. After a half hour of this mystery, I began to think that perhaps I was just having a paranoid Henry Hill Goodfellas moment; dreaming that there was helicopters when there really wasn’t any. Finally, as I descended down into a valley a very real helicopter began to appear through the trees. Moreover, not only was it a helicopter, but it was a helicopter dangling a 50 foot long chainsaw on a cable. It turns out that there was a brush clearing team working on the power line that I was about to cross. When I reached the edge of the powerline, I could see that the helicopter had already come through, as there were piles of freshly cut limbs blocking the Appalachian trail. I picked my way through the fallen brush, and peaked my head out of the woods into the clearing. So, do you know how, when you reach a busy intersection as a pedestrian and you really make sure you are looking both ways to ensure that there is not a Greyhound bus coming along to splatter you on the pavement?  Well, I gotta tell you, that the level of caution is exponentially higher when there is a helicopter with a 50 foot chainsaw operating near you. I paused for 30 seconds or so and saw that the helicopter was remaining pretty much fixed in place about 300 yards down the hill, so I scurried like a little mouse across the powerline and made it safely into the woods on the other side. Another couple hours of challenging, but much less eventful, hiking allowed me to reach the shelter for the evening. Camel and Scapegoat and Cruz all joined me there, as did Hansel, a German northbound hiker who had started in the Shenandoahs. Hansel had been hiking with his girlfriend Gretel for the first couple weeks, which makes the nicknames a little bit more fun. Gretel, however, needed to return home, but Hansel is doing some more solo mileage before he returns as well. I was quite exhausted from the day, so I had a quick bite to eat and off to bed it was.","Tom’s Run Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663565,"I had a super easy day planned today, which was good for two reasons: 1) my legs were feeling it a bit after pushing hard for a few days, and 2) we were supposed to start having some heavy rain in the late morning. I intended to get most of my hiking done early in the day today, and then arrive into Carlisle Pennsylvania, where I would grab a hotel for the evening. This decision was made even easier when I got a text from Navigator in the morning: he was ahead of me, however, he had injured his knee a bit and was spending two nights in Carlisle, meaning that I could split a hotel room with him this evening if I wanted to. So, that definitely became the plan.
I started with a short 4 mile walk down off the ridge and arrived at the edge of some beautiful pastureland.  As I strode across the pastures, I realized that the farm buildings and houses and pastures all reminded me a lot of my home region in Maine. I was, however, not in Maine, but on the outskirts of Boiling Sorings PA. I had been very much looking forward to this arrival, because one block over from where the trail entered the town center, was a café with a great reputation where several of us hikers had planned to meet and load up on a nice hot breakfast. I arrived, and Cruz was already there, since he usually starts his hiking day well before sunrise. I joined him by ordering the “backpacker breakfast“, and got to work loading the carbs and protein (aka French toast, and eggs) into my system. Three other hikers who I had met at the grocery/deli yesterday also joined in the feast.  I was great to just sit around in a normal cafe with a coffee and a pastry and relax for a while. I couldn’t stay there all day (well I suppose I could have, but I wasn’t going to) so it was soon time to load the backpack on and layer on the rain gear, since the skies had opened up while I was inside dining.   The trail first took me through some of the streets of Boiling Springs, and I took time to read some of the historical markers about the steel industry furnaces that had been built there back in a prior century as well as the tourism around the “boiling” (actually just bubbling) springs that rose up in town from deep underground.  Interesting stuff.  I had entered the dead flat Cumberland Valley area of PA, and so my remaining 8 miles over to Carlisle, were extremely easy, albeit soggy.   I got there and met up with Nav, took a quick shower and hit the diner next door.  It was typical diner fare, although they had an impressive dessert case, and I availed myself of a tasty coconut cake.  Yummm.  The rest of the afternoon was spent doing laundry, making a few calls to family, and generally relaxing in a dry environment on my “nero “ day.  We made a second run over to the diner for dinner, since any other location choices would have required a much longer walk in the rain.  The presence of Nav and I dropped the average age of the patrons by a decade or so; the early bird special effect was in full swing for the grey-haired crowd. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Red velvet cake topped off my diner fare this time around.  Two cake slices in one afternoon…yee hah!  Then it was back over to the hotel to pack up for the morning and shut it down for the night.","Alec Kennedy Shelter 
","Carlisle, PA","Apr 28, Fri",11.90
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663571,"Long hiking day today.   I hit the breakfast buffet at the Quality Inn early, as did several other hikers, and I got rolling out of the hotel by just after 7am.  It was no longer raining, but the ground and the grasses that made up the morning hike were definitely wet. I still was able to enjoy several more miles of the dead flat terrain of Cumberland Valley, and the miles accumulated quite quickly.  I was pushing the pace fairly aggressively, because I needed to complete a lot of miles, and I also needed to stop for a resupply in Duncannon, PA.
The first five miles of flatland were soon replaced with a quick 1000 foot bump up to a ridge, followed by an 800 foot drop, then back up onto a ridge overlooking the valley where the Susquehanna river was flowing.   There were a view breaks in trees that afforded decent views into the valley despite the gloomy weather of the morning.   Soon I was descending down into the town of Duncannon.  Amusingly (to me) the last tenth of a mile down into town was a jumbled mess of mis-marked trails that cross-crossed the area. I could see the parking lot where I needed to be, but I just couldn’t seem to get there.  Ultimately, I decided that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, so I bushwhacked down the last couple hundred yards of descent. That accomplished, my first task after the 17 mile morning was to grab lunch and resupply at the 7-11.  They had a surprising selection of prepared foods, and a nice seating area over in the corner where smelly hiker trash could hang out to eat and recharge electronics.  I unfortunately had a front row seat to watch what is probably all too common in our country….a twenty-something kid sat for 45 minutes in front of a video lottery machine feeding money that he probably couldn’t afford into the beast.  He then switched over to the massive paper lotto dispensing machine and bought an astonishing quantity of tickets that he probably also couldn’t afford.  I hope one of them hits for him, or better yet, I hope he finds more fruitful ways to invest his hard earned money. I loaded up my backpack with my resupplies, and headed out the door.  While I was able to get 90% of what I needed at the 7-11, I did need to stop at the local “outfitters “ for a couple items. I put that in quotes, because honestly the outfitter, Kind of Outdoorsy, was a weird little place.  It was a very run down storefront on Main Street, and they ran a hostel in back. I wasn’t staying there, but from what I saw, I was pretty dreary and spartan.  The store area was a dimly lit, really bizarre mishmash of oddly specific items for sale.  They had a few of the hiker staples (mountain house food, tuna packs, etc), but then there was a whole pallet of dishwasher detergent siting in the middle of the store, and about 1000 packs of Huggies lining a shelving unit.  I wasn’t sure if they were trying to corner the eastern Pennsylvania market for Huggies, or just ensure that Nathan Arizona Junior had enough supply if his dad stopped by. As I left the store, there was a bit of a goodbye to be done.  I had been hiking with Navigator on and off for the better part of two months, but he was staying in town to rest his knee and I was pushing on.  A few days later, I will be getting off trail for four days for a family event, and he will surely pass me by during my time off trail.  Being as closely matched in speed as we are, it’s doubtful that I will see him again, and he will probably reach Katahdin a few days before me. Good luck, Nav, it’s been fun!! 
I had another ten-plus miles than I wanted to compete before the end of the day, and this next 10 wasn’t going to be as breezy as the first 17.  The first couple miles were fine, basically a stroll down the lengthy Main Street of Duncannon as it paralleled the river.  After crossing the Susquehanna on a super busy bridge, it was time to climb.  A surprisingly steep ascent away from the river reminded my legs that strolling through pastureland isn’t going to get me to Maine.  After huffing and puffing to get my overloaded pack re-elevated by 1000 feet, I was soon back up on the ridge looking down into the Susquehanna valley.  Frustratingly, I was probably only a half mile from the ridge that I was on three hours earlier.  The straight line distance that I complicated by descending, walking upstream to a bridge, crossing the bridge, walking downstream, and re-climbing could have been done by a crow in 30 seconds of flight time.  Oh well, I didn’t design the AT, I just hike it.  Eventually, as the evening drew closer, I finally reached Peter’s Mountain Shelter, having competed just under 29 miles for the day, my longest on trail thus far.  Of course, usually the first course of business upon arriving at a shelter is to go fill up water bottles from the local spring, and tonight’s spring required a descent down 300 stairs to get the water.  A perfect frosting on my 29 mile cake. My legs were barking. Three other hikers were at the shelter: Deep End, a flip flop hiker who had been in trail for just a couple days; Cobra, who had previously hiked the entirety of the trail northbound several years ago, and was now back for a second bite of the apple, this time flip flopping from northern VA, and finally Inferno, who had only two days remaining to complete his flip-flop hike that he had started last summer.  He had started at Katahdin in June and reached central PA last fall before getting off trail for the holidays (and winter), and then starting northbound from Georgia earlier this year.  True to his name, Inferno started up a fire, and so we all enjoyed the flames for a bit before it was time for me to shut down after a tiring day.","Carlisle, PA

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663576,"This was in my top three worst days on trail. The forecast called for torrential rain all day, and I was positioned at a point on the AT with just about the longest gap between shelters that exists:18 miles.  I suppose I could have hunkered down for the day in shelter where I slept last night, but that doesn’t get me any closer to Maine, so I ventured out into the 45 degree downpour. The rain had been coming down long enough and hard enough that the mountain just couldn’t absorb it any longer, and for at least 15 of the 18 miles I slogged through a river that was theoretically a trail, but was mostly just an ingenious system to efficiently drain heat from my body through cold wet feet.  I had never seen a trail draining that much water off a mountain in my hiking experience.  Pretty much the only thing keeping me moving forward throughout the miserable day was the thought that I would be climbing into a dry, toasty sleeping bag inside a shelter once 18 miles was completed.  For a while, I was trying to rock-hop the entire length of the trail, but it just became pointless, and I had to walk right through the middle of the river/trail.  At one point, Inferno (see yesterdays entry), came blasting by me.  He was clearly on a mission, and he just splashed on through with a determined look on his face. As I was nearing the shelter area, the roar of the mountain “stream” that was nearby was actually a bit frightening.  There was massive amounts of water cascading down the hill.  I was just hoping that some portion of the hill itself was not going to cascade down as well.  I finally reached the shelter, and the cascades continued. The was a set of five stairs leading down from the trail to the shelter, and so much water was gushing down that I had to find an alternate pathway down.  I, Cobra, and Inferno all reached the shelter at roughly the same time.  There was a young couple already there, two ICU nurses from Ohio out doing a four hike.  Their stuff was soaked because they had attempted to ride out the storm in a tent last night, and picked a spot that got totally flooded. As I began to unpack my dry stuff to change, I was suddenly horrified: something had gone terribly wrong with my packing system, and my sleeping bag was totally drenched.  There was no way it was going to dry out in this weather.  I did at least have hiking pants and long johns that had stayed dry, and my puffy and sleeping pad were dry as well.  After getting some food in me, I settled in for a long damp night of sleeping in just my clothes on top of my sleeping pad in weather that was in the low forties.  Sleep was not long and continuous to say the least.","Peter’s Mountain Shelter 
",Rausch Gap Shelter ,"Apr 30, Sun",17.80
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663605,"Last night sleeping in only my clothes on a very wet and chilly night was not fun, and is leading me to a big decision point this morning. I am getting off trail on Wednesday to attend my son’s graduation, but I am thinking that I may have to get off two days early because of my wet gear. I am not sure that I am really interested in slogging another day through ankle deep water, and then having no sleeping bag in the evening.
When the sun rose this morning, even though the forecast was calling for clouds and occasional sprinkles all day, we actually got a 90 minute window at 6 AM where the sun was shining brightly. I hung my sleeping bag on the outside of the shelter on the side facing the sunrise, and the rays did their work and got my bag 75% dry. I decided that I would see how the trails were doing this morning and then make a decision about getting off trail when I reached the first road cross. By the way, I don’t mean off trail as in quitting the hike, I just mean off trail as in taking a six day zero instead of a four day zero.
Inferno was bouncing around the campsite like a little kid; today was his final day on trail, as he had only 6 miles left to complete his entire through hike. His sister was scheduled to pick him up at a road crossing later this morning. I can’t imagine what I will feel like when and if I make it all the way to Katahdin. I suspect I might be bouncing around the campsite myself that morning on my last day.
Anyway, I packed up my gear and headed on down the trail. The nearby mountain stream was still roaring this morning as a full-fledged cascading river, however the trail itself was surprisingly dry. The rain had stopped sometime after midnight last night, and with only a few hours of drainage time it appeared that the trails were perhaps a bit more passable today. After about 30 minutes, I encountered another decision point. My FarOut app had warned that there was beaver dam activity in the area, and that part of the trail was flooded, even in dry times. There is a side trail, actually a dirt road, that adds an extra mile, but routes you around the wetland area. The comments on far out indicated that there were logs and such that could be used as footbridges across the Beaverdam area, but those comments were posted several days before the deluge that we got yesterday. I made the choice to do the dry extra mile rather than the potentially submerged direct route. Again, as I progressed through the morning I was surprised how dry I was able to keep my feet. Even after I descended the ridge down into some lower lying areas where I expected it to potentially be flooded, I was able to find dry pathways through. This finding, along with occasional appearances by the sun through the clouds significantly brightened my mood after last nights misery.
I reached the road crossing where I needed to make my go / Nogo decision, and I decided that I would stay on trail. Whew.  Existential crisis averted.  After another half hour or so, I passed through a trail head parking lot, and met two new hikers. It was a father and son, Charlie Brown being the dad, and Abe was the son. Charlie Brown had a dog along for the trip named, come on you know it already, Snoopy. They were super nice folks who had just returned from resupplying and had too much of everything, so they were offering me food left and right. I accepted an apple, but I had plenty in my backpack already so that was about it. After I climbed back up onto the next ridge, It was late morning and once again the sun had made an appearance, and based on the spacing between the clouds it looked like I might have sun for 45 minutes or so. So, I decided to take a break and pull my wet gear out of my pack and lay it in the sun for more drying. I had a nice lunch and sure enough with the powerful sunshine working its magic I had reasonably dry gear for the rest of the day.
Another factor that had influenced my decision to keep going this morning was the fact that tonight‘s destination was actually an enclosed shelter, with four walls and doors. The “501” shelter is maintained by the local hiking club, and is situated close to a roadway, with a caretaker living in a house next-door. In fact, it’s close enough to a town that you can actually order pizza to be delivered to the shelter and have yourself a feast that evening. Thoughts of greasy pizza in my belly fueled my footsteps throughout the afternoon, and I was definitely enjoying the hike and putting yesterdays mess in the rearview mirror. I passed through quite a long area where fire had burned the ground and some of the trees. I wasn’t sure whether this was a controlled burn, done by forestry management officials, or a wildfire. There had been a wildfire in this area about a month ago, that had a section of the Appalachian Trail closed for a few days. I have passed through a few burned areas in the past four or five days; I’m guessing that one of them was the wild fire and one or more of them was a controlled burn, but I’m not sure which was which.
 I reached the shelter, and Cobra, Charlie Briwn, Snoopy and Abe all arrived at roughly the same time.  There was another guy there, I didn’t catch the name, but he was an older guy, and has hiked the AT seven times, and was now working on his eighth.  That’s a lot of walking. Even though I’m enjoying the heck out of this hike, once is going to be enough for me. As I got settled into the shelter, I was reflecting how much happier I was compared to the same time of day 24 hours prior, and really all it took was being dry and having dry gear.  The only minor bummer for the evening was that it was Monday, and both pizza places that served the area were closed for the day.  But still, overall a good day, and much better than yesterday!!!","Rausch Gap Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663621,"It was a good night of sleep at the 501 shelter, and I awoke in really good spirits. Mostly, the good spirits were driven by the fact that I was only a day and a half away from taking some time off trail to go spend with family. I am very much looking forward to attending the major mile stone event of my son’s graduation, and the fact that my wife, daughter, parents, and in-laws will all be there makes it even better.  I didn’t make many notes throughout the day today, so I don’t have a lot of journal fodder, however I did pass by the 1200 mile mark, meaning that I have less than four digits of mileage remaining in the 2200 mile journey! I also passed by a marker indicating the site of a lookout post “Fort Dietrich Snyder” that was used during the French and Indian war.  So much history is scattered through the woods if our Appalachian region.  The other note for the day was that late in the afternoon I unfortunately was not paying close enough attention and I scooted on past the side trail for the last convenient water source, and I arrived at my campsite with just a few ounces of water left in my bottle.  This was not a super big deal, since I had enough food in my pack that did not require rehydration to ride me over until morning.  I am only going four miles in the morning before I get of off trail, so I don’t exactly need to be operating in peak form at daybreak.","501 Shelter

I packed up my gear and broke camp without the benefit of any water, (see yesterdays post).  Most of the 4 miles was a descent down off the ridge down into the valley that is formed by the Schuylkill river. The final half mile or so was actually pretty steep, and required some care getting down the scree rock.
I popped out into a bustling railyard, where there were trains being loaded up, and the clanging of bells indicated that they were ready to pull out of the yard. There was a pretty cool kiosk with a graphic that was near and dear to my heart given Sunday’s deluge: it provided details on how much water typically drained off the mountain versus getting absorbed by the mountain and its aquifers.  I’m not 100% sure that the math they used for the graphic was accurate for last Sunday, but I’m sure it’s correct in the general sense.  The AT route went right through the heart of the rail yard, and then crossed over the Schuykill river into the little hamlet of Port Clinton.  I will need to remember to mention the river to my son when I see him tomorrow, since he rowed crew on this river two or three times during high school when they participated in the Head of the Schuykill in Philly.
As I walked towards the PC post office, the shuttle driver from Enterprise rental car pulled up at the exact same time, and so, I was now officially off trail.  I was driven a couple miles to the car dealership where the rental agency was co-located, and the check out process was seamless. I did get a few stares from the people having their cars serviced at the dealership; I guess that smelly hikers don’t wander into there all that regularly.  I now had a vehicle and controlled my destiny for the next few days. Step one: Dunkin’ Donuts breakfast sandwiches and coffee right across the street from the dealership.  Heaven!  Then it was on the road for an eight hour journey south to Charlotte. Pretty much the whole day was spent undoing all the northbound progress I had achieved over the prior several weeks.  Combustion Engine + Pavement is a tad faster than Hiker Engine + Rocks.
Soon I was just north of Charlotte for the night; I ran some errands, get some food, and actually got to watch a Celtics game.   Good guys won….go Green!  Then it was lights out at my hotel.","Stealth site four miles before Port Clinton

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663671,"Family time starts today! I picked up my parents at the CLT airport, and after a quick stop for some breakfast (they had left their house in Maine at 3:30am to make their flight) we headed down to Columbia. I stopped quickly at the REI store; I was hoping to replace the tips on my trekking poles, but I stuck out. It was then over to the hotel we would call home for the next two nights. My parents and I arrived in one vehicle, my in laws in a second car, and my wife coming from home came in a third. It was a bit chaotic as we all got unloaded and sorted into the correct rooms, but we got it done.  My son then came over, and he took me and my parents out for a car tour of campus.  While I have been to USC’s campus several times, it was a first for my folks, and I was glad that they got to see a bit of the area where their grandson had spent the past four years.  I’m sure that 99% of his time was spent in the academic buildings, and not a single moment in the Five Points bar area that we drove through. We then joined the rest of the crew for lunch at Market on Main near the hotel where we were staying.  I had two entrees and half of another one that was mis-ordered.  Gotta load in those hiker calories while the getting is good!  Everyone then chilled out at the hotel for the afternoon, although Kristin and I got a chance to walk around the block and see the area a bit. Since it was May the 4th, there was Star Wars activity everywhere (may the fourth be with you).  There was a big screen TV at the lunch restaurant playing Empire Strikes Back, and Kristin and I got an awesome treat during our walk around the block: there is a plaza outside the downtown museum of art, and they were setting up for some kind of public event.  During the setup they had a DJ, the kind with two turntables and a microphone, and he was spinning mixmaster versions of all kinds of Star Wars music.  It was hilarious and definitely entertaining.
The evening was dedicated to a dinner at a nice Italian restaurant.  My shrimp scampi was almost as good as my typical trail ramen with a packet of tuna. Almost.  Lots of laughs were had, we celebrated and toasted Jason’s impending graduation, and then we called it a night.  My king bed on the seventh floor was almost as comfortable as my air mattress / sleeping bag combo on the trail.

Soon we all migrated across town to the graduation ceremony, most of us by car, but my Dad, who is the Rambler 1.0 OG hiker in the family, (even at age 81) and I walked the mile over to the stadium.  USC does the old school version of graduation, and reads every single graduate’s name aloud.  Thousands of grads…OMG it was excruciating, but still rewarding to be there for my son.  We followed the ceremony with a trip to Jason’s off-campus house and we got a chance to meet the family of his roommate….great times. Another family dinner…fantastic fried flounder at Mr. Friendly’s, and the evening was a wrap.  I’m not putting them all into the journal post, but those of you with older kids know the emotions that come along with having a child complete a milestone like this.  I couldn’t have asked for a better day, or a better son.  Truly blessed.","

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663886,"Wow, it’s back to trail life after four days in the real world.  I had one last high calorie breakfast buffet before I headed out for the remaining 100 miles of my northbound drive. I reached the rental car location on time, and was shortly met by Brian, the shuttle driver who was rocking a 1963 Ford Galaxy Convertible 500 for the two mile ride back to the trailhead.   I arrived in style back to the Appalachian Trail!  Brian dropped me at 10am at the Port Clinton post office, where I departed the trail back on Wednesday. Over the weekend, I had switched out my trail runners, and was now wearing a brand new shoe.  It was the exact same model and size (Topo UltraVenture Pro) as my prior shoes. My old ones had 750 miles on them and needed to go. I have been reasonably pleased the the Topo’s…most importantly, my plantar/Achilles issue has been held at bay, and I developed no more than just a couple minor blisters.  The tread felt very sure on rocks, although they did seem to wear down quite quickly, and the traction in mud and leaves was not great after ~400 miles or so.  The toe protectors also started delaminating from the front of the shoe within the first couple days of wear, but fortunately never went further than a few millimeters of delamination.
 I was a bit worried about how the day would go today: you never quite know how your feet are going to adapt to a new set of shoes, and on top of that, I wasn’t sure how my body was going to feel after four days of cushy hotel and restaurant life. After a short walk along the Schuykill river, I would have my first test for the day with a 1000 foot climb out of the river valley.  I was ecstatic that my feet, legs, and lungs all felt great during the climb, and I was off and rolling for the day.  I was also a bit worried that the worst of Rock-Sylvania was about to present itself….that concern was unfortunately well-founded.  For most of the day once I got up in the ridge, my feet pretty much never touched the ground at a normal angle; they were always wedged sideways or rotated in between some lovely sharp-edged rock.
I eventually passed by The Pinnacle and Pulpit rocks, both of which had lots of day-hiker visitors on a beautifully sunny Sunday afternoon. I did run into one NOBO through hiker, Stats.  He had just completed his engineering studies at UVM in December, and was hiking the trail this spring before joining the working world.   He is getting off trail in a few days so that he can go walk in UVM’s commencement ceremonies, and then will get back in trail.  That sounds familiar.  While at pulpit rock, a very friendly group of day hikers offered up some trail Magic in the form of a fresh banana, which I gladly accepted and consumed. I had only planned for a short 15 miler since I got a late start and I wasn’t sure how my body was going to react, and I reached my planned destination, Eckville Shelter, by late afternoon.  It was a setup similar to the 501 Shelter in that the shelter was a four sided structure (although much smaller than 501), and had a caretaker living in a regular house on the property.  The six person shelter was filled by: Jeff and Maila, NOBO’s who had started in January.  I had briefly met them when I passed them on trail prior to my four-day zero. Mike and Vanessa: a couple from Greenville SC who are doing the trail in sections, 100 miles at a time.  Super nice couple, Mike is retired from BMW where he was the chief  facilities manager, and was one of the first employees hired when BMW came to Greenville.  The sixth person in the shelter was Ultra, a lady from Rochester, NY who had started her flip flop hike a couple weeks ago in HF. Ultra’s husband did a thru hike last year, and it’s her turn this year. They took turns supporting each other with the logistics that are needed to get through a hike and still have a functioning home to return to.  When Kristin does her through hike next year, I will be sure to be as supportive for her as she has been for me!  Also at the shelter site, but hammocking outside due to space limitations was Tank, a young NOBO who started in Springer on the same day as me. It was great to see his familiar face coming into the shelter, as I had not seen him for a couple months.  We spent time catching up , and figuring out where various other NOBOS were scattered along the length of the trail. There may be a few familiar faces that I see in the next few days, but for the most part, the folks who I spent the most time with are either too far ahead or too far behind for me to be seeing them anytime soon.  Anyway, food was cooked, and sleep came soon enough.","Interstate 81 - nondescript exit

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664137,"I wanted to put in some good mileage today after knocking the rust off my legs during yesterday‘s hike. I was up early, as were the rest of the shelter occupants, and packed up and rolling by 630. The elevation profile for the day didn’t have too much significant gain and loss, however this is Pennsylvania, so it’s all about the footing not the elevation. As advertised, rock-Sylvania had plenty of bad footing all day. The landscape was dominated by sharp pointy rocks that clawed at my ankles. Pennsylvania is pretty much one long ridge walk, which means you’re getting the exposed rock pile that was pushed up during the last time the continental plates crumbled. It also means that there is very little opportunity to refill your water bottles. I had to carefully plan how much I was carrying and make sure that when I did hit the water locations that I drank a lot while sitting there, as well as filling up the bottles. I was the first one out of the shelter so for much of the morning I really didn’t see anybody on the trail, until I took a break for lunch, and Tank came walking by. Not too long after, Tank was stopped for his lunch, and I returned the favor by passing him by. The day progressed up on the ridge line without anything of significant note; however towards the end of the afternoon the landscape changed a bit and there was a really long walk through an overgrown field up on the ridge through a section that had recently been rerouted by the trail volunteers. It was notable because you could now see down into the Lehigh River Valley, which provided some interesting views.  This particular stretch was dominated by some old industrial infrastructure that had been built along the river; I’m not sure but I am assuming it had something to do with the steel industry. The river made its twists and turns and eat at each bend there was another hulking factory building.Eventually it was time to call it a day, and I arrived at the shelter, and I was currently the only occupant at 6 PM. A day hiker walked by almost immediately after I arrived, and we had a prolonged chat as he was quite interested about this stretch of the Appalachian trail, having just recently moved to the area. He told me that only about a half mile away he had just encountered a black bear along the trail. I decided to be extra careful about hanging my food from the trees this evening. After about 30 minutes Tank also arrived at the shelter and for the evening it was just the two of us. We both used the shelter for sleep space, since there really wasn’t any great tenting sites around the periphery of shelter. Food was cooked, bags were hung (with care!) and hiker midnight arrived.","Eckville Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664139,"This morning’s hike was good old fashioned hiking fun. After getting out of camp reasonably early, it was a quick descent down into the Lehigh River Valley. After crossing over a set of busy roads and the bridge over the river, it was time to, of course, climb back out of Lehigh River Valley. The climb out was what was fun. It was super steep with lots of rock scrambles, and some ledge hopping. I definitely needed both hands and both feet working in coordination to get up and over some sections. Good fun, can’t wait until I get more of this up in New England.
Unfortunately most of the rest of the day was a return to the rocky Pennsylvania marching that has been the norm for the past several days. It was just different variations of how densely clustered rocks were going to be at any given time. It was also another day of really managing water supplies carefully. Thankfully at one of the road crossings there was a water cache that had been left by local trail angels, and I was able to refill my bottles from it. Thank you much Trail angels!
Tank and I leap frogged each other several times during the day, but other than that I did not see too many other hikers on this midweek day. I did run into Spokes, who was slackpacking southbound after just recently starting his flip flop hike.
Tank and I ended up pausing for a rest at the same shelter in the early afternoon, and we both quickly determined that it wasn’t a shelter, it was a snake pit. There were three different snakes all coiled up in various corners of the shelter walls, waiting for their next mouse meal to walk on by. All three were black snakes, which are generally pretty docile, but that said, I was glad I was not spending the night at this shelter. I continued to push on for another few hours, but eventually it was time to wave the white flag and call it a day. I selected a stealth site near a water source and set up my tent. Wonderfully, the water source was large enough and deep enough that I could plunge my feet into the cold flowing water and soothe those dogs that were barking. I cooked up a backpacker meal and then off to bed with the quietness of the woods around me. I double checked the walls of my tent to make sure that there weren’t multiple snakes hanging around and then drifted off to sleep","George Outerbridge Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664140,"Today is the last day in Rocky Pennsylvania! After 10 days of long ridge walks without significant scenery, and annoyingly rocky footing, I am ready to leave the state in the rearview mirror. That said, it’s still hiking, and it’s still more fun than working! I packed up my gear out of my stealth site and off I went down the trail. I had called yesterday to arrange a room for tonight at a hostel in the town of Delaware Water Gap. The mileage to get there was a very manageable 17, so I was very much looking forward to an easier day and was looking forward to getting a good solid dose of town food this afternoon and this evening.
Early in the morning I passed by a trail sign showing that I had only 913 miles remaining to reach Mount Katahdin in Maine, which was a fantastic visual reminder that there are three digits, not four digits, left in my mileage for this adventure. I know that I will hate for the journey to eventually come to an end, but at the same time it’s good to know that progress continues to be made and I am drawing ever nearer to the finish line.
As I have been continuing northward, it has been fascinating to watch the various signs of spring appearing and moving through their growth stages. Whether it’s new types of flowers, or fattening leaves on trees, or even seeing the green creeping up in elevation from the valleys up to the mountain tops it has all been signs of spring’s inevitable arrival. Today I was treated to a really beautiful ridge top landscape where the trees had been thinned out at some point in history and there were tremendous quantities of yellow wildflowers growing up where the light reached them.
As I drew closer to Delaware Water Gap in the late morning, the landscape changed somewhat with sharp rocky outcroppings providing interesting vistas down into the valley. The noise level also began increasing. In this particular valley, the noise of the rushing Delaware River is unfortunately mostly masked by the noise of the rushing participants of interstate commerce. Interstate 80 passes through this gap, and is a tremendously busy transport lane for trucks moving east and west. That said, the noise from the interstate, and the visual of the interstate itself didn’t actually seem to spoil the scenery…. in my mind, the flowing river of trucks just provided an interesting contrast to the rugged natural beauty of the flowing Delaware river.
I soon reached an area where local trails from the valley were crisscrossing the AT, as this is a National Recreation area and has quite a bit of infrastructure to support daily visitors. Soon I was dropping rapidly from the ridge down into the valley, crossing several streams along the way (agua, finally!). One of these streams had a beautiful waterfall and a deep pools, and there was a young couple enjoying themselves hanging out on the rocks. The guy asked me if the water was safe to drink. While I was flattered to be potentially considered a water quality expert, I am not (and I didn’t stay at Holiday Inn Express last night) thus I really had no idea.  I told him that I filter everything no matter what. Eventually I dropped down to the last natural feature of the day, a pond on the edge of town in what apparently was historically a resort area back at the turn of the century.
I was soon on the streets of Delaware Water Gap, and arrived at the front door of my home for the night. I had to chuckle, because the comments on FarOut were spot on. The property is a really old house, that was and is falling apart. I was welcomed by the owner, Marty, who is a contractor and builds obstacles for the Spartan races during race season. His local project is rehabbing this historic property. He has owned it for five or six years, and apparently the buildings were quite dilapidated when he purchased them.  There were power tools and other construction materials everywhere.  The set up for hikers was a bit different than most places along the trail, in that he was offering really just places to sleep on the floor, with access to a shower included in your stay.  I was staying in the outbuilding, which was basically a barn, but he had recently built an apartment inside the barn for his son, but the son had moved out.  As a result, I had a whole bedroom and a kitchen and a bathroom to myself.   There was no hot water, though, so I had to head over to the other building for that.   All in all, it was actually a pretty good place to stay, as long as you didn’t trip over the power tools on the way in. I got cleaned up, and since it was still early afternoon, I headed to a pizza place for a Stromboli the size of my head.  Within minutes, there was twelve pounds of mozzarella cheese, dough, and sausage sitting in my belly.  I’m so proud.  I then headed across the street to a highly recommended bakery, where I got some tasty items for tomorrow’s breakfast, and then over to a convenience store to pick up a few other resupply items.  I walked back to the hostel to hang out for a bit and make some calls, and it was great to touch base with family.  Finally, I headed over to the Sycamore Grille for a dinner, since it had been at least two hours since I ate the 12 pounds of Stromboli.  A much healthier spinach salad with chicken and pears capped off my evening, and then it was back to the apartment to drift off into a food coma for the evening.","Stealth site near 1280.1

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664143,"After a breakfast featuring the bakery items I bought last night, I packed up and said goodbye to the cool little town of DWG. I was also about to say goodbye to the state of PA in just a few short minutes.
The trail routed me through the maintenance depot for the Bridge Authority, so I passed by the guys working on dump trucks and other assorted gear needed to maintain the bridge and the toll systems that sustain it.  I was not wearing my EZ Pass transponder this morning, so hopefully I didn’t get charged as I trudged by.  The bridge over the Delaware River and the nonstop lineup of trucks and cars that looked so fascinating from 1000 feet up yesterday….didn’t seem so fascinating as I walked the span of the bridge on a sidewalk separated from the traffic by only a waist-high concrete barrier.  Trucks doing 75 as they pass your elbow with about three feet of separation will make you question what the heck you are doing there at 7:30 in the morning.  Halfway across the bridge, there was a NJ/PA border marker painted on the sidewalk, so I was officially in the Garden state.  The Sopranos theme song was stuck in my head for the next two hours. As I reached the parking area on the other side, I thought that the startling traffic scene, the concrete parking lots, the porta potties, and the signs warning you not to leave valuables in car all were an unfortunate greeting to northbounders arriving in this state.  Fortunately, the concrete jungle quickly gave way to a scenic climb up the other side of the valley, and I decided that New Jersey is actually Two Jersey.  There is Department of Commerce NJ, which is all trucks and concrete, and then there is Department of Tourism NJ, which encompasses a really picturesque northeastern corner of the state that features rolling hills, and very few man-made structures visible for miles from the tops of those hills.
As I climbed out of the valley, I was mentally preparing myself for the onslaught of sharp pointy rocks again, as the ridge from the last 100 miles of PA continues another 30+ miles into NJ….state boundaries don’t mean much to geologic features. Fortunately, however, the early morning parts of the trail are used by tens of thousands of day hikers during the busy season, so the trails have been cleared and widened over the years to support that traffic.  I also noticed that at various points the rocks seemed more rounded off, meaning that I was finally getting far enough north to where the glaciers did their work on much of the terrain a few millennia ago.
My morning destination was Mohican Outdoor Center, which is a sprawling complex run by the AMC that has cabins and kayaks and other support infrastructure to enjoy the DWG recreation area.  My reason for stopping was not boating, but bacon.  The MOC also runs a grill/deli, which meant that I was going to get another “real” meal before returning to backpacker food.  I ordered up a couple breakfast sandwiches and spent an hour or so relaxing and recharging my phone.  I chatted with a family who was doing a section hike there.  They were a couple about my age along with an adult son who was seriously developmentally disabled.  I was so glad to see that they were making an attempt to expose him to the joys of backpacking.  They were pretty new to hiking, however, and had backpacks that were just enormous.  Hopefully they cut down the weight a bit as they move along, as it will surely aid their enjoyment of the trail. The woman had just recently downloaded FarOut, and had lots of questions that I was happy to answer as best I could.
When I departed, I decided to follow the Rattlesnake Swamp trail for a mile or so, since it parallels the AT and provides a slightly different landscape and view than the ridge waking of the last many days.  I was happy to find that there were no rattlesnakes nor even really any swamp in the trail, and the brief foray was a nice change of pace.  In this stretch I encountered the single largest hiking group I have seen on the trail….a youth group of some sort with a couple adult leaders. They must have had 50+ kids out for a day hike. Good times.  I also passed by and circumnavigated Sunfish pond which is a local glacier carved lake.  It was a great change of scenery to just see a pond, as it feels like I have not seen one in weeks.  The footing around the pond was unfortunately a return to the sharp pointy stuff and made forward progress difficult.  I also passed by the first honest to goodness active beaver bog that I had seen in a while, with lots of telltale conical carvings of tree stumps.
As late afternoon arrived, I was again impressed by how far out into the “wilderness” I could see with virtually no signs of human activity.  It felt much more remote than being just a couple dozen miles from the sprawl of north Jersey.  My legs were eventually ready to call it a day, and I found a stealth site near a water source to set up camp.  It was quite buggy, and I think it might be time to add a head net to my gear for those occlusions.  But, it was a really enjoyable day of hiking in surprising Two Jersey.","Delaware Water Gap

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664152,"When I started the day, I didn’t exactly know how far I was going to get, but I knew it was going to be a hot day, and I wanted to get a lot of miles done early before the sun really started cooking. I rolled out of camp just after 6, and was treated to some very nicely illuminated vistas on the ridge during the early morning hours.   It was still rocky on the ridge, but the footing was much more manageable, and didn’t disrupt my stride too much.  By mid morning I had reached Culver Fire Tower, and what a treat I had in store! The tower was paired with No Trespassing signs, and there was a truck parked next to the tower. I saw that there was a fire warden actually manning the tower up above. I shouted up to him to see if it was OK for me to climb up, and he enthusiastically invited me to ascend.  When I reached the top, I was treated to a great conversation with Chuck, who has been manning this tower and others for 30 years with the NJ Forest Service.  He spent time pointing out the features in the surrounding mountains, and let me know that there are 21 active towers in NJ, with a 22nd being built somewhere near the shore due to a newly constructed water tower blocking the view of an existing tower.  The towers are manned from 10am to 6pm throughout the fire season.   He had both old school maps as well as a pretty good array of electronics at his fingertips.  Chuck is also the fire chief in one of the local fire departments, and you could tell that he loved his line of work.  It was truly an honor to have met him, and I thoroughly enjoyed the conversation.  It was time to push on, so off I went into the hills that Chuck knew like the back of his hand. I decided around that time that I was going to crank out some miles today, and see if I could reach Unionville, NY by this evening.  Unionville has a village green where hikers are allowed to pitch a tent for the night.  The town has a pizza place, a general store, and a grill restaurant, so it seemed like a perfect place to try to reach. As I hustled through the hills of NJ, I passed through High Point State Park, which encompasses the highest point in the state of NJ. I paused for a few minutes rest at an elevated deck that provided nice views over the surrounding terrain.  I also stopped into the park’s visitor center for a few minutes to get out of the sun and buy a couple cold drinks. They didn’t have the normal Pepsi/Coke brands, but instead had something called C&C cola. It was fine, but I would think that company might be better served by opening a Music Factory.  I don’t know, either way, today’s heat was just Gonna Make Me Sweat. While there, I chatted with a visitor who said it was actually quite a bit cooler up here in the hills than just a few miles away where she lived, so I was thankful that the day didn’t turn into too much of a scorcher. I continued plowing onwards, and finally around 7pm I reached the town after putting in a long 29 mile day.  The grassy area for tenting was very nicely maintained, and was adjacent to a playground where some kids were playing. There were a few other hikers there, including Stampede, a section hiker from Calgary who I had first met back in Carlisle. I also met Oz and American Frodo (not the British Frodo), who are both NOBOs like me, and had started after me, so they are cruising along quite quickly.  I grabbed a cold soda over at the general store and then got my tent set up in the grass on this Norman Rockwell type evening in small town America.  There were families enjoying ice cream from the store across the street and people just generally relaxing on a beautiful Friday evening. I headed over to the nearby restaurant, a tavern that was very bustling with Friday night patrons. It was surprisingly loud, which was a bit of a shock to the system after the quietness of the woods, but I enjoyed my burger and spent some time texting with friends and family back home.   I finished up my meal, and then it was over to the park to crawl into my tent for some sleep after a long day.","Stealth near 1319

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664194,"I woke up with my legs feeling sluggish from yesterdays long miles, and also with an accompanying stomach ache from the burger and fries that I had last night, so I dawdled around Unionville longer than normal on a gorgeous Saturday morning.   Horlers general store made a fine breakfast sandwich, and I sat on their front porch facing the Main Street and watched the town wake up and get active on a weekend morning.   I ran into Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and Abe for the first time since before my graduation break, as they had taken a zero yesterday and were starting their morning here in town. I picked up some additional provisions at the store, including a sub sandwich for later today and then finally headed out of town around 9:30.  The morning featured really easy walking, which was great to ease myself back into hiking.  The route included a circuit around the flat wetlands of Walkill National Wildlife Refuge and I shared the trail with local folks out running or taking a leisurely stroll to identify the local bird population that made their home in the Refuge.  The area also included an almost mile long walk through a (different) wetland along the Pochuck boardwalk, which again made for very easy walking and provided different style of scenery than the typical elevated ridge lines of the area.  There was even a really cool wood and cable pedestrian suspension bridge that spanned over an open water section.  All good (flat) things must end, however, and soon it was time to get back to the business of climbing.  It was only a modest rise, however, so my legs responded reasonably well to the challenge of shaking off the weariness from yesterday. There was a looming challenge, however, that I would be facing in the mid afternoon.  A popular local climb named “Stairway to Heaven” was incorporated into the upcoming section of trail and would need to be summited.  With such a challenge forthcoming, I thought that it was only prudent to fuel up with some additional calories, and lo and behold, I arrived at Heaven Hill Farms and Bakery, which had fresh made ice cream, cider donuts, and other delectables.  I sat outside at one of their picnic tables and watched the parade of people coming and going.  The place was first and foremost a garden center, and there was a lot of spring spruce-up business being transacted today.  It also looked like a lot of folks were getting flowers…probably for tomorrow’s Mother’s Day celebrations. With a belly full of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, I felt like I was probably ready to tackle the Stairway.   I’m sure that Page, Plant, and the boys would have been proud as I Rambled On up the incline. I had a spring in my step that almost felt like a Misty Mountain Hop.  Soon enough I was at the top, and I continued on down the trail.I had one final challenge for the day: I rounded the corner at a bend in the trail, and I abruptly stopped short, because there was a 200lb black bear sitting in the rocks next to the trail about 50 yards ahead.  I had heard that NJ had one of the densest populations of bears along the trail, and here was evidence of exactly that.   It seemed like this one had a bit of a Jersey attitude; even when I clanged my poles and shouted, he stayed put, seeming to indicate “if you want to walk through, you are going to have to take a piece of me”.  By the same token, he was not making any aggressive moves or postures, so I decided that we would call it a draw.  I let him have that particular piece of trail, and I circled way around him in the woods.  He watched me the whole time I was bush whacking, but never moved off his throne.  The encounter was not particularly unsettling, but it was a good reminder that it’s not just us humans out here claiming the woods for ourselves. i continued hiking on to my destination at the Wawayanda shelter, which was only another mile or so past the bear. When I arrived, it was quite a busy scene as there was a good sized Boy Scout troop located there, and several other hikers as well. I caught up with Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and Abe, and also Stampede. I got my tent set up into a somewhat unoccupied corner of the tenting area, and chatted with the gathered  masses for a while. Then it was time to get some food, and let hiker midnight draw the day to a close.","Unionville NY

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664203,"What an enjoyable day! I was at a spot in the trail where my shelter choices called for either a 14 mile day or a 28 mile day, and I knew I didn’t want to do 28. As such, I decided it was going to be a leisurely low mileage day. The trail set up perfectly for me today: by mid morning I would be reaching a side trail that I could descend for about a mile down into the town of Greenwood Lake, and enjoy some town food. There was also going to be an opportunity for my second helping of ice cream in two days in the mid afternoon as well.So, I departed out of camp, stopping by at the Wawayanda Park headquarters building to use their water spigots and restrooms. Then it was off for a nice ridge walk on a gloriously sunny Mother’s Day morning. I took some time to reach out and wish my wife and my mom a happy Mother’s Day. Thank you Kristin, for raising two wonderful kids with me, and for supporting me while I’m doing this crazy journey up the trail. Thank you, Mom, for everything you’ve done for me over 50 some years and for being everything a kid could hope for in a mom! Mid morning I crossed the state line from New Jersey into New York. Technically, I had hit New York a couple times yesterday, including the town where I slept last night, because the trail zigzags back-and-forth across the border for a while. Today’s boundary was, however, the final departure from New Jersey. I hit the side trail to Greenwood Lake shortly after the border, and a half hour later I was down in this charming lakeside town.I set up shop in a bustling bagel store, which was abuzz with people getting bagels and baked goods for their Mother’s Day celebrations. In fact when I arrived there at about 10:30 the store had almost no bagels left. Kind of like a cheese shop with no cheese. But, there was one or two left, and I quickly ordered a couple bacon egg and cheese sandwiches, and relaxed at their tables while recharging my electronics. I chatted for a while with a guy who could tell that I was a through hiker (surely from the stench and grubby clothes) and he let me know that he had worked as a volunteer in past years to build some stairs along the trail up in Maine. Thank you once again to all the trail volunteers out there who keep these pathways maintained and functioning well for all to enjoy. After hanging out there for a bit,I made my way over to a local convenience store to get some resupply items for the next few days. Finally I wanted to have one more round of high calorie town food before I left the town, so I popped into the local pizza shop, and had a slice of chicken masala pizza, tasty! Then it was time to take my full stomach back up the hill and get onto the Appalachian Trail to work through the day’s mileage.When I arrived back onto the trail, I ran into two familiar faces: Bath and Moon Pants were hiking together. I had briefly met Bath back at the Mohican center a few days prior, and Moon Pants and I had hiked near each other for a few days back just before entering the Smoky mountains in North Carolina. It’s always interesting to experience the ebb and flow of hikers back-and-forth along the trail. The three of us walked together for an hour or so, until we arrived at Belleville Farms creamery.This place is clearly a local institution, and with good reason. It sits high up on a ridge with beautiful green pastureland rolling like a carpet down from the shop into the valley below, and you could see forever on this sunny Sunday from their picnic tables. We were not the only ones with the idea of getting ice cream on a Mother’s Day Sunday, and there was probably 50 people in line ahead of us. That was just fine for me, however, because I was in no particular rush this afternoon. Shortly after the three of us arrived, Tank also came strolling in and joined us in line for the 20 minute wait for cold creamy goodness. While we were snaking our way through the line, one of the other patrons began chatting with us; he had done quite a bit of hiking in the white mountains and enjoyed discussing thru hiking with us. He wanted to deliver us some trail magic that day and offered to buy us all ice creams, but he was 10 people behind us in line and it seemed pretty awkward to just take money from the guy, so we politely declined his gracious offer. I eventually got my cone full of chocolate chip cookie dough (yes, I went for the same flavor two days in a row), and the four of us hung out for a bit finishing up our messy treats. While I was talking with the three of them, I realized that I had missed the fact that there was a good stealth site option listed in FarOut that was beyond the 14 mile shelter but well before the 28 mile shelter and would make it a very reasonable ~20 mile day. So, I decided that even though I had burned quite a bit of daylight with my Greenwood Lake visit and my Belleville farms visit, I had plenty of energy and plenty of daylight to get to the stealth site. That decided, off I went with a bit faster pace in my step than this morning. It was a pleasant walk through this section of New York State, with good footing and manageable elevation change. I arrived at the tent site by 7 o’clock, and got my gear set up. The site was located adjacent to a stream that was feeding into a nice pond, and there was plenty of wildlife running around the area. Interestingly, the water was actually quite warm, probably the result of a few recent warm sunny days, and also a stream path that was not protected by shade. Tank, Bath and Moon Pants all arrived into camp within a half an hour or so after I did, and we all chowed down our dinner in the quiet forest. In dwindling daylight, I ate only a small amount of food since I was still pretty well nourished from the earlier meals in the day, and I crawled into my tent and called it an evening.","Wawayanda shelter 
",Little Dam Lake Inlet Tentsite ,"May 14, Sun",19.10
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664311,"As the sun rose in my little corner of the Appalachian wilderness, otherwise known as Orange county New York, it was cool and damp due to my proximity to the lake I camped by last night, but I knew today was supposed to be a bit on the warm side with highs reaching close to 80°. With that, I wanted to get an early start and get as much hiking done before the heat set in as possible. I did, however, break from my recent tradition of just eating bars for breakfast, as I have been carrying a couple oatmeal packets ever since my trip to South Carolina, and they needed to get tossed or get eaten. I chose the latter. I quickly packed up camp and was off and moving for the day. The 1st mile or so had me circling around the little lake that I camped near and it was a beautiful early morning scene, with fog rising off the water, and various birds dipping in and out. I even saw a beaver chugging along through the water on his commute to his morning work site. Pretty soon, however, my attention was focused on my feet rather than the scenery because the terrain turned very rugged, and I was needing concentration to get up, over and back down all of the sharp rises and dips that the trail layout presented to me today. I could tell that I was probably going to be plenty tired at the end of my planned 16 or 17 mile day today. I always wondered who got the privilege of naming the various trails, and more interestingly, the individual features along the trail. It always seems like those with that responsibility are trying to out to do each other with the naming structure. Everything from Dragons Tooth, to Pinnacle Pulpit, to Stairway to Heaven, to Fat Man’s Squeeze. Today’s winner was the Lemon Squeezer. It was definitely a challenging little piece of the trail. First there were two massive rock formations side-by-side with a really narrow channel in between the two of them, and the trail of course went right through that narrow little channel. I actually decided that it would be easier for me to navigate this little 25 yard stretch with my backpack in my hands rather than on my back, and so I found myself throwing my trekking poles like a javelin 30 feet ahead of me, and then tossing my backpack up onto the rocky ledge above, and then fitting myself through the squeeze. All in good fun, and it made for an interesting diversion for the day. Immediately after the squeezing part of the lemon squeeze, was a scrambling part where some de devilish trail layout genius sent of the trail up and over a little cliff which was more like a rock climbing wall than a backpacking path. Again, all in good fun, but it did take a little bit of time to get up and over.
I then transitioned into slowly descending down a section of the trail in Harriman State Park nicknamed Agony Grind. I’m not sure if the name is a bit overblown, but my knees were indeed grinding a bit on the decent down. Hopefully there is still some cartilage left in those knees when I finish this little trek in the woods. The downhill dropped me into a valley where interstate 87 and Route 17 run parallel to each other. Both roadways needed to be crossed: 17 was crossed at surface level, without much problem, and of course for the interstate there was an underpass where I could safely trod. I have driven both of those roads plenty in my past, and I have probably spent time in a vehicle going more slowly along the roadway then I was making progress with my backpacking just then. I am very happy that I am spending most of my time these days on foot rather than being trapped like lemmings in shiny metal boxes. Of course, any long descent into a narrow valley must  be rewarded with a rigorous climb out of said valley, and that’s where I really started sweating to the oldies that day. Even though the terrain throughout the day was challenging, I love it! It is definitely reminding me more and more of the New England hiking that I have enjoyed for the past many decades. The constant up and down, the rocky yet passable pathways, the mixed hardwood and softwood forests, all are hinting about my impending New England arrival. I have also been pleasantly surprised about the scenic views that are available in this stretch of New York as well. Having lived in this area for a brief time back in the 90s, and having driven through here many times in the ensuing years, I never fully appreciated how much spectacular scenery there really is in the area. Even though the hills never reach much above 1500 feet, the frequent drops into valleys accentuate each rise visually from the next. The interspersed rocky outcroppings, glacier carved lakes, and blooming Hudson Valley, all make for a very iconic landscape and visual treat. Of course, your legs have to pay for that scenery with its constant up and down, and that’s what I was doing today.
It was definitely becoming a struggle as the miles mounted and the heat index rose this afternoon, and I really had to pay attention to where water was available at stream crossings. Eventually, I had a bit of a problem with exactly that. There is a section of trail that has been closed by state park officials since spring of last year. This stretch of trail leads the hiker to the edge of the Palisades Parkway, which is a major thoroughfare leaving out of New York City up into Westchester and Putnam counties. I have driven that roadway enough times that I agree with the officials’ decision to not have hikers playing live Frogger to scurry across that roadway.   The detour added an extra mile to the hike, and unfortunately also skipped over two critical water sources, and I misread the water information in FarOut. There was no other available water until climbing up and over the 1300 foot Bear Mountain.  I had been thinking about trying to find a stealth site for the evening on the south side of the mountain, but I quickly determined that this plan was not going to work, since Bear Mountain is a major local tourist attraction and is covered with cross crossing trails and loads of day hikers. At this point in the late afternoon, with beat up legs and empty water bottles, I decided I was going to summit the mountain, and then go grab a room at the Bear Mountain Inn at the base of the mountain. When I reached the summit, I was ironically happy to see that it was very much built out for tourists, because there was drink vending machines at the top, meaning I could slake my thirst.  Chugging down a coke gave me enough hydration to get ready for the descent.
I passed by the tower monument at the top, which had several day hikers enjoying the scenery and quickly started down.   It looks like the park service has recently completed a major construction project, because there were hundreds of granite stairs that have been put in place.  After an already long day, the hundreds of stair steps required to descend to the bottom of the mountain, beat up my knees pretty thoroughly.  When I reached the bottom, the beautiful Lake Hessian laid out in front of me, and quite a number of families were enjoying picnics by the shoreline.  I checked in with the clerk at the inn, and bought a couple additional cold drinks to bring over to my room.  The Inn unfortunately did not have any food service, so I ordered up a pizza for delivery from a local place.  That gave me enough time to take a relaxing shower and wash the trail off of me.  The pizza and garlic knots that arrived a while later were absolutely heaven for a hungry hiker.  Not much time elapsed between the last morsel of pizza and the first minutes of sleep.","
",Bear Mountain Inn,"May 15, Mon",22
Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664315,"I had a good night’s sleep in the hotel last night. I think I pretty much have the building to myself, as it is still very early in the season, and it’s mid week. I think this hotel seems to be part of the overall Bear Mountain State Park system, but may also be geared for conferences and such.  This definitely was not the typical hiker hostel that I have been staying in for the past three months. I was feeling some weariness from pushing hard yesterday, and I promised myself that today I was going to keep to a very manageable mileage. With the terrain of New York being a little bit more rugged than I had expected, it has been hard getting my head wrapped around the fact that 25 mile days are not going to be typical in this section, and that I need to be thinking sub 20 most days. Today I was tentatively planning for a 15 miler over to a campsite that I saw listed on the FarOut app.
I took my time getting ready in the hotel, and even took a second shower, just because I could. I took the time to re-organize and re-pack all of my gear, as I had taken all of it out of my pack last night so that the dampness of the trail could air out of it a little bit. And unfortunately, my $175 room rate did not buy me any included breakfast, so I was left to eat my normal trail breakfast of energy bars and Pop tarts. I finally got ready to leave at about 830, and headed out the door. I will say, that the grounds of Bear Mountain State Park are quite spectacular with Hessian Lake sitting at the bottom of the rocky face of Bear mountain, and walking trails circling around. The grounds were pretty much deserted at this time of the day on a weekday morning, but I am sure it is normally overrun with people during the summer months and on weekends. My very 1st mile on the trail was to take me through the lowest elevation point on the entire Appalachian trail. Part of Bear Mountain State Park is actually a zoo, and the Appalachian trail passes right through the middle of it. It is right along the shores of the Hudson River and sits only 150 feet or so above sea level. This zoo presented me with my first decision point of the day: the zoo did not open until 10 AM, so I needed to decide whether I would take the alternate Appalachian trail pathway which circles around the zoo, or wait the 90 minutes for the zoo to open. I decided that since I could probably come back anytime and walk the quarter-mile through the zoo if I really wanted to see animals in captivity, and because I wanted to ensure I could walk at a leisurely pace the rest of the day, I decided to do the walk around. At the spot where the normal through-the-zoo Appalachian Trail exits the zoo, it dumps you right at the crossing point of the Hudson River on the West Bank of the Bear Mountain Bridge. When I reached this point via the alternate route, the back service entrance to the zoo was actually open. I decided to walk in 100 yards or so and look around, and was in there for just a few minutes before a worker politely informed me that the zoo was still closed and that I would need to exit the grounds. No harm no foul and off I went. The bridge itself is a quite impressive piece of architecture, especially given the fact that it is almost 100 years old. There was quite a bit of interpretive signage along the pedestrian pathway across the bridge that provided details about the bridge construction and a other facts throughout the years. It had been quite a number of years since I had driven across this bridge, and it was pretty neat to now walk across it. Of course, any time you cross a river it means only one thing: a climb must be coming. Those rivers tend to carve quite a little hole in the ground over a millennia or so. With that, it was time to ascend the east side of the Hudson River Valley. And up I went. On my way up I passed by a woman who was section hiking, after injuring herself during a through hike pre-Covid, and then having an aborted hike at the beginning of Covid. After the initial ascent up the valley wall, the terrain became quite reasonable and my pace was quite rapid. Once again, as is often the case, food was a big motivator. There was a trail-side deli that I was going to reach at about lunchtime, and I was looking forward to another dose of real food. I reached the Appalachian Market at 11:30 and it was a great set up, with picnic tables outside, and a huge selection of hot and cold foods at the deli. I went with a chicken cutlet and bacon hot sub and was extremely pleased with my choice. There was quite a crowd of hikers there, in addition to the hustle and bustle of normal every day deli customers. I feel like I might be in a little bit of a bubble of hikers, because it seems like there are definitely more folks on the trail these days. Joining me at one of the picnic tables was Curly, the woman who I had passed earlier in the morning, and Cat in the Hat, a flip flop hiker who had started in Harpers Ferry in the beginning of April. Also arriving at the deli just as I finished, were Oz, American Frodo, Moon Pants, and Bath. They had all slept near the top of the mountain last night in a stealth site near an abandoned ski jump. After ordering an extra cold sub to take away for my dinner later this evening, and a few extra food supplies, it was time to leave the comfort of the deli and push back into the woods after my nice 90 minute break. The rest of the afternoon continued with the typical New York terrain of sharp but short ups and downs on fairly rocky surfaces with some occasional easier walking interspersed in between. I reached the Dennytown Road campsite around 5 PM, and it was a really great set up. On one side of the road was a small field that adjoined the road, and this was the spot that Appalachian trail hikers were supposed to use for camping. On the other side of the road set back about 100 yards from the road with a nice stand of trees separating it from the roadway, was a nicely mowed field with picnic tables and fire rings and porta johns. Since it was a Tuesday in the middle of May and no camping groups were around, I and several other Appalachian Trail hikers decided to make use of this side of the road. 
By dinner time, occupying the campsite were Rooster, Bleeder, Oz, American Frodo, Bath, and Moon Pants. I had several phone calls to make this evening, so I didn’t socialize an awful lot tonight, and soon my tasty Cappy ham deli sandwich was eaten and hiker midnight was here.","Bear Mountain Inn

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664324,"I had a great treat coming this evening: catching up with an old work buddy from my days at IBM East Fishkill back in the (gulp) late 80’s / early 90’s.  But first, I had some hiking to do.  I had arranged to meet Paul at the trail intersection with Old Highway 55, which was going to require a 23 mile day. Fortunately the weather was perfect, and the scenery was fantastic. Early in the day, I was treated to the scenery of Canopus lake, as the trail traced along the shoreline for most of the entire length of the lake.  It was really quite beautiful this morning with the early daylight bouncing off the still surface waters.  I also passed by a plaque near a dirt road crossing. It provided a brief history of the site where a smallpox inoculation station for George Washington’s troops during the winter of 1776 was located. The army used a barn that was previously there at the site as a shelter to accomplish the task.  Imagine that….a commander in chief who was in favor of vaccinating folks…hmmmm, seems very well informed to me. An hour or two later, I summited a short rise that had a nice ledge area with great views throughout Putnam county.  Also on this particular ledge, someone had painted a nice American flag with a remembrance message about 9/11. I’m generally not in favor of any “graffiti” in our natural areas, but this one was very tastefully done, and since you could almost see NYC from this spot, I actually thought it was appropriate and well done.  Soon, I rounded another corner, and I could see down onto Interstate 84, and I could see the massive complex where 10,000 IBMers, including me used to work.   I continued through the ups and downs of the mid-Hudson valley, and quickly accumulated the day’s mileage. I soon reached the road crossing where I was going to meet Paul, and he arrived within a couple minutes to whisk me away for an evening with his family.  I had a wonderful time catching up with him and his wife, and even had the opportunity to connect with another old work colleague who also lives close by.   Paul whipped up burgers, chicken, and dogs on the grill, and my body enjoyed the protein bonanza.  It was a fantastic day of hiking, and a perfect evening of connecting with old friends.","Dennytown Campsite

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664396,"After a fabulous evening with Paul and his family, this morning got off to a great start as well.  Paul cooked up some omelettes, and I had another great feast.  We then headed off back to the trailhead, and he was kind enough to stop in to the local grocery store so that I could resupply as well.  With my bag suitably loaded with calories, it was time to start walking once again.  It was also serendipitous that last night was chosen to spend indoors, since it was below freezing for the first time in quite a while. There was still some frost in spots when I got back on trail. After getting dropped off and saying goodbye, I was soon traversing the shoreline of Nuclear Lake….it wasn’t glowing, so I guess that’s a good sign.  The NY style of sharp ups and downs continued throughout the morning, and my legs got a good workout.  Eventually I came down into an expansive boggy area that was a preserve of some sort, and it had a really long boardwalk built through it.  About halfway through there was an expanded area of boardwalk, kind of like a dock into the marshes, and there were two Adirondack chairs sitting on the structure.  The one on the north side was labeled “Maine” and the other was labeled “Georgia”. Love it!   It was also the perfect time and place to grab a quick bite, so out came the sub sandwich that I had bought at the grocery store this morning. After the short respite and food intake, I continued onward, and shortly arrived at the famed (in the world of thru hiking) Appalachian Trail Train Station.  It was pretty bizzare just sitting there at the edge of a field, and seemed like it probably doesn’t get a whole lot of loading and unloading going on, but nonetheless, I understand that you can get a direct train to NYC from here.  I have been to NYC enough times in my life that I didn’t opt for that little side venture this time around. The whole scene also seemed to really accentuate the juxtaposition of rural and suburban/urban landscapes that are in play throughout this section of the trail.  NY, NJ, and CT are all pretty densely populated states, yet most of the time the trail is routed such that you don’t get the sense of being in the thick of humanity….with the occasional exception, like a train platform, to remind you otherwise.  To further enhance that concept, immediately after crossing the road next to the train station, I was literally walking through the middle of a herd of dairy cows.  My stomping trail runners did not seem to interrupt their grassy lunchtime even one iota, and I just smiled as I did a nimble two-step to avoid the cow pies along the trail.  As I reentered the forested section, I unfortunately had to navigate through a long stretch of under-maintained trail.  There were quite a few blow-downs, and lots of overhanging branches.  At one point the top of my backpack had been grabbed by branches so many times, that I could have sworn that I heard “I’m Groot” from the side of the trail.  Anyway, it slowed my pace a bit, but it was mostly just an inconvenience. At the end of this stretch, it was time to say goodbye to yet another state as I passed over the NY/CT border.  Final thoughts on the NY stretch: I really enjoyed it!  I was surprised by how difficult it was, but it also seemed to be a first taste of New England style hiking, and the scenery was superb as well.  Two thumbs up!  I continued into the Ten Mile River section of CT, which was quite picturesque, and saw several people on the shore casting lines into the rushing waters.  The trail had saved up a final 1000 foot climb for the end of my day, but I was rewarded with fine views off the top of Schaghticoke mountain.   (I still don’t know how to pronounce that).  A few additional miles brought me to Schaghticoke campsite, which is where I hung my hat for the evening.","Paul’s house

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664800,"Today was one of those days, when the (literal) ups and downs of the AT wore on me just a bit. The scenery here in western CT was quite nice as I progressed along the Housatonic River valley, but I was feeling sluggish all day, and it seemed like I was only focused on eating my way through my heavy backpack. I think my body was reminding me that thirty pounds have disappeared, and it is prodding me to keep shoveling coal into the fire or the locomotive is going to come grinding to a halt on one of these uphill stretches.  The day also had a surprising amount of up and down.  I’m not sure why I use the word “surprising”. I used to live in this area, and have driven up and down this valley a number of times, so I certainly know that the terrain exists, but I have never hiked along this stretch of the AT, so I guess the fact that its route seems to hit every little peak caught me off guard.  I passed by Kent, CT which has some significance for my son, as his high school crew team used to row against Kent School multiple times per year during the fall and spring rowing seasons and during the championships season as well. In fact, I’m not sure I ever heard the word “Kent” without the verb “beat” just before it; or perhaps a more colorful preceding adjective that might not be appropriate for my gentle readers. A good indicator of my tiredness throughout the day, is that I had almost no notes scribbled in my phone for journal fodder, and only two photos snapped during the day.  There was a prolonged flat stretch along the Housatonic river that gave my legs a break for a couple hours today, but then it was right back into the hills for some more ups and downs.

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664801,"Today was going to be one of the better days on the Appalachian Trail. I had an event to look forward to at the end of the day, because a good friend of mine from my high school years and her husband were meeting me for dinner in Salisbury Connecticut.But first I needed to hike through more of Western Connecticut to get myself to Salisbury. I had a very reasonable day planned, so that I could get into Salisbury and get into my hostel room and get showered and laundry and re-supply done before Amy and Chris arrived. I also had a nice diversion coming in the morning, as I would be stopping at a very highly recommended cafe for a mid morning meal.  My day had a bit of a time crunch, as there was rain forecasted to start by early afternoon, and I was ideally going to get to Salisbury before it started.With all of that on the horizon, I hit the trail early (about 6) and my feet were flying along terrain that was much more forgiving than yesterday’s slugfest. Again, I never cease to be amazed how I can end up having a really energetic set of trail legs the very next day after having a weary and sluggish hiking day. I was treated to several nice overlooking views of the valley throughout the early morning. I could also hear the sound of automobiles accelerating and decelerating pretty harshly, and I thought to myself that Connecticut drivers seemed really aggressive on a Saturday morning. As I progressed along the ridge however I realized that I was overlooking lime rock racing track, which had some events going on that morning. I couldn’t see it very well, but I could see the cars occasionally zipping around the track. I don’t see that every day on the Appalachian Trail! Shortly thereafter, I descended down off the ridge in to the edge of the town of Falls Village. I crossed over an attractive bridge with an Appalachian trail logo emblazoned on it and continued up the road to my morning food Mecca. The Mountainside Café was only about a quarter-mile off trail, and as I was walking towards it, I saw Moon Pants and Bath coming the opposite direction, having just finished their meal there. Both gave it two thumbs up, so I was ready to bring my hiker hunger to the table. When I arrived, Atticus, a hiker I had not seen in several weeks, was sitting at a table, so I joined him. I had a wonderful streusel French toast meal and some other sides and I don’t think I’ve had a better breakfast along the Appalachian Trail. It was absolutely top-notch. It was also great catching up with Atticus. He has been hiking at a very similar pace as me, but we always just seem to be off each other’s schedule by a day or two. even today, I will be stopping at Salisbury , whereas he is going to continue on an extra few miles since he has no business to conduct in Salisbury. Before I finished my meal, yet another hiker, Tank, arrived and joined  me as I was finishing my meal. I was torn between staying and hanging out for a while longer or continuing to move down the trail so that I could beat the rain, but I eventually chose to move on.The trail basically stayed on a nice flat grade down along the Housatonic river for the next couple miles, and I passed into the center of Falls Village. There was a cool old dam and power producing station there, and this morning a group was launching about 20 canoes into the mildly rapid waters of the Housatonic for a day on the river. I paused for a moment or two to watch them launch and go down through the rapids, and everyone seemed like they made it just fine. I passed a pretty cool sign that said “welcome to Amesville“, which appears to be a section of Salisbury. I also passed by another sign that was meaningful to me, which indicated a big round number: I had logged 1500 miles since the start of my journey in Springer Mountain; the miles remaining just keep getting smaller and smaller, and I can almost see the end of the journey on the horizon. Soon I reached the thundering set of waterfalls that gave Falls Village its name, as the Great Falls were cascading down quite a volume of water this morning. I dropped my pack and scooted down a little side trail for a moment or two to get some photos down near the riverbank, and it was a pretty cool sight. I also enjoyed seeing a lot of the old revolutionary era homes that dotted the roadways along where I was walking, definitely a old Connecticut vibe to the area.Eventually the trail routed me back up into the hills, and I continued along the ridge up above the Housatonic. soon, I was getting close to Salisbury, and the skies were darkening. It was going to be a race. Was I going to get to the hostel in time to stay dry, or was it gonna be a wet afternoon for Jeff? The answer: it was a wet one. I missed it by 10 minutes. I was walking the final couple streets of Salisbury to get to the hostel and the downpour started. Oh well no worries, I didn’t melt. The set up for the hostel was a bit different than most: there was a 90 something year old lady who lived in the home, and not in very good health. Her grandson who doesn’t live there takes care of the reservations and arranging where everyone is going to sleep. I was let into the house by the woman, and got into my room just before my roommate for the evening, Spider-Man, joined me. I had actually run into Spider-Man yesterday on the trail very briefly, but had not had a chance to chat very much. We hung out for a while and talked, and I really enjoyed his company. He is a younger guy from Wisconsin, on a leave from a teaching assignment, it is doing a roughly 300 mile section of the trail that will be ending in a few days.I showered up, and ran over to a nearby bakery, to get a little bit of early afternoon food before my dinner this evening. I got pretty wet on the trip there and back, but it was worth it for the tasty calories. I hung out for a while longer at the hostel and got my laundry done and caught up on a few phone calls with family. Then it was over to the White Hart Inn, to meet up with Amy and Chris. it was a fantastic dinner together, with each of us having the rabbit pot pie special that they offered. Tasty! I was stoked to hear about Amy’s new job getting the Sing Sing prison museum up and running in the next 18 months or so. It’s going to be a fantastic facility for visitors and I am sure she and the rest of the team will put together a world-class exhibition. It was also great getting to know her husband Chris a little bit for the first time as well. We finished up our meal together, and said our goodbyes, and it was back to the hostel for hiker midnight.","Pine Brook Swamp Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664804,"After having a great time dining with friends in Salisbury, this coming week is all about the timing and logistics of meeting a different set of friends on Memorial Day weekend somewhere in western MA. Actually, the “somewhere” is going to be Williamstown and Mt Greylock, which means I know exactly how far I need to cover over the next few days.  Fortunately, it’s a very manageable distance, and I can take the foot off the accelerator for a few days early this week. With that, I had a relatively lazy Sunday planned for today.  I headed over to the bakery again, and got a nice cup of coffee to get the day started, where I met three other hikers: Speedy from NH, Long Walks from ME, and Peepers from Germany.  It was then over to White Hart’s “provisions” section, where they had breakfast sandwiches….perfect.  I also grabbed a sub for today’s trail meal and popped over to the grocery store for a couple other resupply items. When I got back to the hostel, Ed was working to get his VW Vanagon started up to volunteer shuttling runners at a charity road race later in the day.  I don’t see Vanagons all that often any more, and he has two of them.  After chatting with Spider-Man for a while, it was time to get moving down the trail.  Spider-Man is taking a zero today, but hopefully I get a chance to connect with him down the trail somewhere; he’s a good guy.
I strolled out of town with a relaxed pace, and the Eagles “peaceful easy feeling” playing in my head.  As I started climbing the hill out of town, I ran into a troop of Boy Scouts who were descending down from a wet night in the hills.  It was a good night to be inside! For much of the morning, I had great views down into the valley, especially over to the lake on which Salisbury School rows crew.  I had been on that lake a couple times watching Jason’s team, and the Salisbury parents were fantastic hosts who actually brought the visiting parents out on pontoon boats to motor alongside the race and cheer for our kids.  Good memories.  There was quite a goat path along the edge of the ridge in this section, and I had continuous views throughout the valley for a long stretch. Eventually I reached the summit of Bear Mountain, which was popular with the day hikers, and had a massive pile of man-placed rocks on which to sit and enjoy the vista.   I lingered for a while and had a snack, and then continued on my way. Soon I passed another milestone:  The CT-MA state border.  Ten states down, only four left to go!  After just thinking earlier this week that it will be nice to get back to New England trails that follow streams for a while as opposed to Southern trails that just seem to only cross over and then diverge from streams, I came upon Sages Ravine, a wonderful brook running down through a spruce forest into the valley.  Very picturesque.
I shortly arrived at my destination for the evening: Hemlock Shelter, which sat in a gorgeous stand of, you guessed it, Hemlocks. An older couple, Maple and Birch were there for the night while section hiking for a couple weeks during their break from teaching and administrating at American University.  We were later joined by three friends from Ohio who have been doing week long section hikes for years, and are working to eventually complete all of the AT.  We all enjoyed some conversation, cooked up our meals, and then hiker midnight shut us all down.  A Peaceful Easy Day of Hiking.","Salisbury, CT

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664805,"A relaxed week doesn’t mean zero mileage, and I had a choice today between 19 or 21 miles depending on whether I wanted to go to North Wilcox or South Wilcox shelter.   I figured that I would see how my legs felt when I reached the first one and then make a decision.  I was not in a particular hurry to get out of camp this morning, but since everyone was up at sunrise, I didn’t exactly dawdle around either.  >span class=""apple-converted-space""> We will have to get Watson and the meteorological teams working on a suitable answer for me, ‘cuz I need to know.  

As I marched north, eventually the Taconic ridge that dominates the area was coming to an end, and I began a quite rugged descent down into the valleys.  I then spent considerable time walking through some flat pastureland, and paralleling along the Housatonic river for a bit.   I encountered a section hiker named Tumbles from TN who was headed my same direction. I also passed by Grinder, who had stayed in the same hostel back in Salisbury, but had left early in Sunday for a full day of hiking.  Grinder is finishing up the AT this year.  He is probably 15 years older than me, and this guy can seriously move down the trail.   He started this year back in PA, and is going as far as Gorham, NH, which will complete all the sections for him that he started pre-Covid.   

I moved out of the pastureland and into a really beautiful spruce forest.  >span class=""apple-converted-space""> It seems like, even though I have certainly seen walls throughout Appalachia on the journey, they seem much more prevalent in New England. One in particular caught my eye; there was some great dappled sunlight striking a wall that was covered in moss that was almost luminous.  Once again, I wish I was a better photographer to capture and do justice for scenery like this. The beauty of the scene aside, this particular forest was also home to a hellacious swarm of mosquitoes who were super excited to have a mid morning snack waking through their cafeteria.   Stupidly, I had not yet put bug repellent or a bug net into my backpack, so my only defense was to pick up the pace and flail my arms at the well organized air assault. Was I Godzilla to their Tokyo?  I don’t know but I wasn’t hanging out long enough to find out.  Once out of the forest, I continued my walk along the Housatonic, and as I reached the end of that section, I realized that it looked super familiar; in fact I had parked my car there a few years earlier when I had hiked a short section of the AT in western MA.  This time around, there would be more than just a two-day hike…how many?  140? 160?  Still a lot of distance left between me and Katahdin to find out.  
After a short road walk, there was a fairly sporty climb out of the river valley, but I was rewarded with a great lunch spot on a massive boulder overlooking the area.  I even had cell coverage, so I used the opportunity to check in at home as well.  
I eventually pressed onwards, through some unspectacular wooded sections and soon ascended upwards to South Mt. Wilcox shelter.  It was still pretty early in the afternoon, and my legs still had some spring, so I decided to go ahead and do the additional couple miles over to North Mt Wilcox shelter.  At the shelter were a section hiker from Charlotte (never got his name), and another section hiker from Germany who did not really speak much English.  I was also greeted by a million mosquitoes and black flies.  The Charlotte guy shared some of his Picardin which partially helped to keep the flying nasties away.  He also got a smoky fire started, and that helped as well.  We were soon joined by the group of three that I had met in Salisbury a couple days earlier: Speedy (lady from Canada), Long Walk About (guy from MA), and Peeper (a lady from Germany).  The guy from Germany was ecstatic that Peeper arrived, because he now had someone who could translate a bit for him.  Anyway, while the chemicals and the smoke were good half-measures against the swarm, I quickly decided that the best move was to crawl inside my tent and zip the mesh closed so those suckers could go pick on somebody else.  It seemed like all the hikers had similar thoughts, because the site was pretty quickly silent, and hiker midnight arrived.","Hemlock Shelter

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665385,"What a fantastic day in the Whites!  Mother nature delivered a great day for hiking, and it coincided with a section of trail that offered fantastic views throughout the day.  This, combined with my anticipation for seeing my parents this afternoon for a much needed zero mileage day tomorrow had me in a great mood.  
But first, I needed to get my day started.  I rolled out of bed at 5:00, since I wanted the opportunity to meet up with my parents at a decent hour this afternoon.  I needed to be a bit careful during my morning pack-up as things were a bit slippery from the wetness of the area.  We had a few showers overnight last night, and even after they ended, the air remained saturated at nearly 100% humidity, so the tent and the tent platform were soaked this morning.  I had a healthy breakfast of hostess glazed donuts (breakfast of champions!) and got packed up. I had been a bit worried that the tentsite was going to be completely jammed on a summer Saturday night in the Whites, but while it was certainly busy, it was definitely not full to capacity.  As I got ready to head down the spur trail back to the AT, I took a few minutes to enjoy the awesome viewspot that was accessible by climbing a small ladder up onto a rocky outcropping.  It was absolutely spectacular as the sun rose over the spine of peaks (South Twin, and the Bonds) that form the eastern edge of the Pemigiwassett wilderness.  As I got rolling onto the AT, I was greeted by a brutally sketchy descent from Garfield.  Basically I had to drop about 500 feet of elevation by rock scrambling down a flowing brook, since it had been filled to capacity by the steady rains of the past week.  While this scramble was surely White Mountains kind of “fun”, I hoped that I would not have to have this level of challenge all day long, or I was going to soon be a spent puppy.  Fortunately, after the first half mile or so, the conditions eased up a bit into just the “regular” kind of boulder and root-strewn pathway that is typical in the Whites.  By 8:00-ish I reached Galehead hut.  By this time, the sun was gloriously visible for the first time in days, and my spirits were high.  At the hut, there was a sizeable throng of weekend hikers who had just finished breakfast and were getting ready to start their hiking day.  I wanted to pop inside for a few minutes, and as I made my way up onto the porch, I suddenly heard my name being called.  It was Atticus, who I had not seen in over a week.  He had spent the night as a paying customer at the hut (something which I immediately filed away in my memory banks, as I might be doing the same thing in the next few days or so).  It was great to see another Georgia-starting north bounder, as we are relatively few and far between these days, especially in comparison to the numbers of weekend and section hikers that are out enjoying the Whites.  While there at the hut, I also encountered Mishap, another NOBO.  He had started from GA jut two days after me, yet somehow, we had not met until now, 1800+ miles into the journey.  After filling up my water bottles and scrounging a few scraps of free leftover breakfast, I got back on trail at the same time as Atticus.  We climbed the 1000+ feet or so required to get to the top of South Twin Mountain, and were rewarded with spectacular views of the Pemi, and all the way over to the Presidential range.  Mt Washington summit was actually visible this morning, and the snow and ice winked at me from across the range.  I’m hoping that the frozen wonderland has evaporated before I get over there in a few days.  My computer’s screen saver photo for the last few years was a snapshot that I took during a hike over South Twin a few years back; that particular day when I summited, all the spruce trees were coated in rime ice, and were glistening spectacularly in the morning sun.  Happily, I was not treated to that same visual this particular morning, and I was very content with conditions that enabled shorts and a t-shirt as my hiking attire. From South Twin summit, it was a short jaunt over to the edge of Mt. Guyot, where the AT then heads off toward Zealand Mt.  The rock field on the edge of Guyot this morning also delivered the goods in the form of wonderful views of the Bonds and back over to yesterday’s playground of Fraconia ridge with its progression of summits (Lincoln-Lafayette-Garfield).  The late morning was capped off by lunch on Zeacliff, where a short side trail spur leaves you perched on an overlook down into a cavernous valley, while still affording views over towards the Presidential range.  Wow! 
A journey of another mile or so brought us to the Zealand hut, where the cascading Zealand falls provided a visual and audible backdrop for a relaxing break from the hiking.  We went inside and enjoyed a few tasty morsels, and listened to the banter of the young “croo” who work there.  Ah, to be 20 and full of energy…those kids are having a summer that they are going to remember forever, and they all seemed to be completely enjoying their jobs and the situation.  Who wouldn’t!?

After filling up water bottles, it was time to get moving again, and we headed down the gently sloping trail towards the end of the day’s journey.  There was one additional cool sight for the afternoon, and that was the Whitewall Slide, where a massive slide pile of boulders is strewn down the mountain from some ancient landslide (or perhaps multiple ancient slides).  It honestly looked like what I imagine a war zone would look like after a bombing run…the length, depth, and overall scale of slide was really impressive.  
The remaining 6 miles or so was a fairly unspectacular descent down from the majesty of the Whites, into a very boggy (and buggy) area around Ethan pond, with the eventual runout into the Ripley Falls / US Route 302 parking area where I was going to meet my parents.  During this last part of the day, I had a minor equipment issue…I normally keep my Crocs hanging off the back of my backpack, and today was no different.  Unfortunately, as I was bushwhacking around a fallen tree, one of the crocs caught on a branch, and the plastic rivet that holds the back strap to the shoe tore apart from the shoe.  I stuffed the shoe inside my pack and compartmentalized that repair job for my upcoming zero day tomorrow.  
It was about this time that I also decided to take my foot off the hiking gas pedal for the afternoon.  I had given my parents a range of estimates for my arrival much earlier in the day, and I was running significantly ahead of the earliest ETA that I had communicated.  Unfortunately, I had no cell coverage the entire afternoon, and I could not provide any updates, so I figured I might as well back off.  With that, it was a relatively relaxed stroll through the woods, and I got down to 302 just before 4:00.  There was quite a crowd of motorcycle riders hanging out at the trailhead.  It is Bike Week in Laconia, and really all of NH, so the state is currently awash of motorcycle riders. I plunked myself down over in a (relatively) quiet corner of the trailhead, pretty close to the highway so that I could hopefully see my folks coming.  Sure enough, after about 10 minutes, they came driving along.  I bent over to grab my backpack off the ground, and as I did, I could see them continuing on down 302.  I ran out into the road and waved my arms as they disappeared down the highway, but to no avail.  Hmmmm, next move?  I had no cell coverage so I couldn’t call them.  Nothing to do but wait, and hope they figured out that they missed the pickup spot sometime before driving halfway to Massachusetts.  So, I sat back down and watched the parade of cyclists (and other drivers) motoring along.  Finally, after about 20 minutes, a familiar green pickup truck appeared on the horizon, and this time they were not going to sneak past.  They pulled in and we had a lovely reunion.

After loading up, we headed down the road to Conway, so that I could stop at Eastern Mountain Sports and pick up a few supplies.  I had not been happy with the performance of my Marmot rain jacket during the last few sustained rains, and with another week of rain in the forecast, I decided to upgrade.  We shall see whether my new investment makes any difference in the next few days as I am humping it across the Presidential range in the wet.  
We then stopped at a local outpost of a national casual dining chain (rhymes with Snapple Peas), and I knocked the edge off my hiker hunger.  It was then a somewhat longish drive back over to my hometown, where a hot shower had me ready for bed about a nanosecond after my arrival.  Is it still called “hiker midnight” if you are not technically on the trail?  Who cares…it was bedtime, with a zero day awaiting me tomorrow. ","Garfield Tentsite

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665387,"A relaxing day back in my hometown.

What to do on a day with no mileage planned?  Step 1:  Sleep really late.  OK, I failed step 1.  It’s almost summer solstice, and Maine starts getting light at about 4:00 AM.  I managed to stay in bed to 5:45.  But, soon the smells and sounds of bacon frying downstairs had me wiping the Pavlovian drool from my chin, and I jitterbugged downstairs to get me some of that.  It was a great morning of relaxing with the company of my parents at their quiet hilltop house.  I peeked out the second floor window to see if I could see Mt Washington 50 miles to the west, but the treetops were a bit too full this time of year to allow the view.  Oh well, I am pretty sure the mountain has not moved since yesterday, and it will be awaiting my arrival back in the Whites on Tuesday.  
Zero day unfortunately means “chores day”, and the day was basically a series of tasks related to preparing me for the next section of my hike.  That included a re-stocking trip over to the Super Wal-mart.  A happy fact that I realized while I was making my purchases:  Since I am planning to come back to my parent’s place in about a week for a Nero day, I was not necessarily prevented, as is normally the case, from buying food choices that have annoyingly large packaging.  I could simply take what I need for this section, and then next week I can consume the remainder.  As such, the shopping cart was pretty full, and I was able to add a few items that have not appeared in my food bag for a while; like dried pineapple, and some different granolas.  
I also decided to pull the trigger and commit myself to a bit of “platinum” thru hiking for the next few days.  I’ll admit it, the weather situation in the Whites has gotten in my head a little bit.  I have hiked in these mountains enough to respect the hell out of the potential weather in the Presidential range, and the snow and ice that accumulated up there just a couple days ago has me thinking very conservatively.  With that, I am going to be spending nights this coming week in two of the AMC’s huts: Mizpah hut on Tuesday night, and Carter Notch hut on Thursday night.  I have stopped into these huts often for a midday hike break, but have never actually a spent a night in one….I always thought of the huts as destinations for novice weekend hikers from the city who want a backpacking experience without really doing the hard work.  I’ll need to knock a bit of the smugness off myself now that I’m committing to staying in them because I don’t want to endure another 5 day stretch of wet gear and wet body.  The kicker for me was that the night’s stay includes a full dinner and a full breakfast.  With that, I don’t have to carry nearly as much food, and I am going to be able to go six days without an off-trail resupply.  So tomorrow, after making the 2+ hour drive back over to Crawford Notch, I will “only” be doing a 7 mile hike up to Mizpah.  Granted, that includes about 3000 feet of vertical gain, and its going to be pouring rain the whole time, but still, it’s only going to be 7 miles, and then I can dry off, not set up my tent, and have someone else cook me food that doesn’t come delivered in powdered boil-in-bag form.  Sounds like a good plan.  
I spent the rest of the day taking care of some things with my folks, and enjoying their company and mom’s chocolate chip cookies….yummmm.   I also completed two repair jobs. My crocs now feature some lovely red duct tape accents on their sidewall, which will hopefully provide enough structural rigidity to keep the rivets holding the straps in place. All the fashion forward thru-hikers will surely be sporting similar designs at the Milan runway shows this fall.  Second, for the past couple weeks I had been dealing with a slow leak in my air mattress.  It was slow enough that I could usually get through the night without major issues, but slow leaks don’t typically heal themselves; they typically become not-so-slow leaks, and I definitely did not want to be dealing with a repair job on the trail.  So, after a long process of finding the leak (it was small enough and slow enough that I could not see it or hear it, even after finding it with the “dunk it in the tub and look for bubbles approach”), I patched it up.  Hopefully when I come downstairs in the morning, I will still have a nice fully inflated pad greeting me. 
I then got most of my food repacked and figured out for the upcoming six-day section between Crawford Notch, NH and Grafton Notch, ME. It required a lot more mental math than normal since I needed to account for the food that I will get at the huts, and also at the Mt Washington visitor centers that I will pass during the journey.  Anyway, its not rocket science, but it consumed more time than I expected.  
It was then time for a hearty pasta dinner…it reminded me of the days back in high school when we would host pasta parties at our house before cross country meets…”carb loading” a pile of spaghetti was the epitome of high end nutritional strategy back in the 80’s.  Michael Scott was not wrong to eat that bucket of pasta primavera before his 5K race.  Have we found a cure for rabies yet?  Let’s hope.  It was then time to (finally!) start attempting to catch up on some journalling.  Having access to a full-size keyboard, full-size screen, and fast internet makes this process so much easier and enjoyable.  Back to the Whites tomorrow!","Crawford Notch

Rambler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665527,"I started the second morning of my day and a half break waking up to the smell of bacon sizzling downstairs at my parents house.  I jumped in the shower and then went down and started loading up on food. The creature comforts of home are super-addictive!  We were planning to leave to head back to the mountains around mid-morning time; my parents needed time to run downtown and cast their vote in the red-hot town council race that was occurring that day.  I finished packing up my supplies and my backpack, and even took the step of weighing in. With a liter of water, and roughly 4 days of food, I would be carrying 35 pounds up the trail today.  We got rolling down the road, and after a quick stop at Subway for an early lunch, I was dropped back at the Crawford Notch trailhead at 11:30. I was ready to start getting some miles accumulated again. Today was just going to be a short stretch, however, since I was going to make my first ever stay in an AMC hut - Mizpah hut to be specific. It was a pretty steep climb out of the notch up Webster Cliff trail. I had been looking forward to this climb, because there are dozens of spots along the way that offer spectacular views down into the valley; but as has been the case a lot recently, there would be no views for me today, other than down to my boots splashing through the wet trail. I was completely socked in by fog and clouds, and there was no more than 100 foot visibility the whole way up.  The clouds dumped rain on me a few times during the ascent, and I was glad that my destination was going to have a roof other than my tent for the night. Eventually after about three or four hours of climbing , I reached the hut.  I had stayed at this site previously, but only at the adjoining Nauman tent site, never in the hut itself.  I had to get over my hiker prejudice that huts are only for city people who want to come dabble in the mountains, but not really leave the comforts of home behind.   I checked in with the staff and got assigned into a bunk for the evening.  The place was only going to be roughly 30% occupied, so it was a relatively comfortable setup.  I changed into dry clothes and hung out in the common room for a while, looking at maps and reading up on trail descriptions in the white mountain guidebook. I also chatted with some of the other guests.  There were two guys who were doing a 175 mile section, but were probably going to have to cut it somewhat short; the slow going due to weather and trail conditions caught them by surprise.  There was also a family of five (two young girls, mom/dad, and grandpa) who had flown in from Chicago and were spending a couple weeks checking out New England‘s sights.  Two sisters from CT were out doing their first hike without parents; the older one was getting ready to go off to college at Colby in the fall and major in environmental policies.  Soon the hut crew was summoning us all for dinner, and I sat down to a feast of soup and bread and potato salad and pizza and mixed veggies and brownies.  It was awesome to have this much food (and such tasty food) and not have to carry it or cook it!  Now I see why people pay the money to do this hut thing.  One of the crew also gave a talk about how they bring supplies in and out of the huts (mostly the crew members carry it in on backboards, other than a helicopter assisted delivery that occurs before the season gets started).  An AMC volunteer also gave a talk about all things Moose related.  Basically he just read a bunch of pages from a “moose facts” binder, but it was entertaining for some of the guests. Soon my body clock told me that hiker midnight was approaching, and it was off to my bunk room to get settled in for the night.","Crawford Notch
