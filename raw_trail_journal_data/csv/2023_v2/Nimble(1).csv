Nimble,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625335,"My name is Jack Spurrier and I have wanted to walk the AT for many years. Now that I am retired I now have the time. I have worked outside my entire life and love being outdoors. My main motivation is to honor the legacy of my firstborn grandson, Lincoln Spurrier, who was only with us for 8 short months.  I hope to raise awareness to neo-natal liver disease and possibly make a difference for some other children in the future. There will be more on this in the near future. Looking forward to seeing you on the trail.
I am in the process of acquiring my gear and have been taking extended hikes for a couple of months. I am 68 years old but really feel that I can do this. Though hiking is new to me but am looking forward to the challenge.",,View Entry,"Dec 18, Wed",0
Nimble,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625339,"Now that my time frame for starting gets shorter, the excitement grows.  Would really like to thank my wife Deloris for all the positive support she is giving me. When I think about being gone for 6 months and what this means she will have to do to make up for my absence makes me even more appreciative of the good things in my life. As we come into the holiday season it is good to reflect on all the positives. See you on the trail.",,View Entry,"Dec 19, Thu",0

Sent out flyers to friends and family            today to let them know how to support me and to follow along Trailjournals.                           Am getting more excited every day. Will spend three or four days totally outdoors next week practicing my camping skills. Figure if I can do it in January, March and April will be a piece of cake.                                                                For those of you who are here in response to my mailing, thanks for your support.

This is a shake down to learn how to use things like the water filter and just generally living out of a pack.                                                      Want to give a special shout out to a couple of folks. First to Lane Hunt my hiking “guru”. If your in the Bowling Green, Ky. area look him up. He has been hiking extensively for years and is very knowledgeable.  Also want to thank Kurt & Becky Radtke for their generous contribution to my grandson’s charity. Mostly I would like to thank Kevin Miller of MPC for his more than generous donation. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

My main course I have laid out is 1.55 miles and I had time to do one more. But due to the dampness I was pretty sore and my hands were really cramping. Made it hard to adjust straps on pack. I am so glad I stopped when I did because it started raining pretty hard. Was able to get everything in tent before it got soaked.                                                        Really disappointed I have only walked 24.68 miles in three days but with learning how to load pack, filter water out of lake, and keeping myself hydrated and fed I guess it’s a good start.                                                            Will camp out at least one more night or maybe two and then walk the next day.

Nimble,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626014,"11.55 miles today!  Started breakfast at 7:30 this morning and got back to the house at 3:30. Eight hour day, ate breakfast and lunch and filled water bottles out of lake. This is much more like it. Still cold and damp today but I seemed to handle it better. Must have been all that vitamin “I” Taken last night and this morning. (Ibuprofen). Slept like a log last night until I had to “water the lawn”. Got out of the sleeping bag, found my camp shoes and went out in the cold and wet.  Came back in and got back in the sleeping bag all zipped up and comfy when I became very hungry.  Since there are no bears where we live, the food bag was in the tent but down at my feet covered up somewhere. What a dilemma. All I can say is that Snickers sure did taste good. Have to get on my “honey do” list tomorrow so am taking a day or two off training. 36.23 miles in four days is not going to cut it. But I guess since I only saw the sun for about 45 minutes the whole time it’s a good start. Catch up we me next week.",,View Entry,"Jan 30, Thu",0

About 3 miles of this was continuous uphill climb. I have to admit the continuous uphill about killed me. Don’t know what, but must lose some weight out of pack. Just feels too heavy.    Also learned water source in camp can be straight down hill for 8 or 9 hundred feet straight down a hill. Makes for a nice walk after walking all day.

Lot of hill climbing today, but it seemed easier than yesterday.     Light rain started about noon. Am having discomfort in my left foot. Had to stop and tape foot. Walked over 100 miles in these boots before starting. Walk 10 miles on the trail and my left foot is killing me.     Foot pain slowed me down some.  Goal was Gooch Mtn. Shelter, but when I got to Cooper Gap freezing rain was coming down. Although 3  miles short of my goal, I decided to stop.

Cooper Gap was on a road so I called for a shuttle. Tent froze to the ground with half inch of snow on top. Some moron really couldn’t get this all back in the pack. Decided to get room and thaw everything out. Last night and today were real learning experiences. Of course once I got in room, sun popped out and it turned gorgeous. Will take off again tomorrow.       One other thing, hanging bear bag in tree for the first time in freezing rain and wind gusting 40 to 50 mph was an exhilarating learning experience.     Also posted Feb 25th and 26th today.

Could not get shuttle back to trail until then. Got to Woody Gap at 3:30 PM. 8.3 miles in 6 hours. Two major mountains to climb and one nasty rock strewn trail. I am very happy with today.      Temperature going down to 20 degrees with high winds. Another hiker and I are sharing room to keep down expenses. Supposed to warm into the 50’s starting tomorrow. Of course that will bring rain. I believe today was a sign that things will get better.     My trail name was bestowed on me yesterday. I am now Nimble.  As in Jack be nimble. Got that when I slid down a slick rock and somehow caught myself with my trekking poles. (You were right Lane).

     Tomorrow will be short day. Have to send some things home and have my pack rebalanced and next camp is either 5 or 12 miles out. I don’t think I’ve got 12 miles in me, especially with a late start. 
      The climb up Blood Mtn. was long and the south side had a lot of snow and ice on the trail. The decent side was solid rock and rather slippery. It is the tallest mountain on the AT in Georgia. The view from the top was breathtaking.

Out of the 6 miles today, 5 of those were uphill. Unable to find water on the trail. Where we stopped was over a mile to the next water. After passing two dry water sources and darkness coming on we called for a shuttle into town. We did not want to take a chance the next water hole was dry.     Next three days is supposed to rain. Hopefully it won’t be as heavy as predicted. We plan on walking anyway.       Want to once again thank everyone for their support.

So for all intents and purposes the AT is shut down.    However, they have amended their rules a bit. When the CDC or Federal Government gives the OK to resume normal activities, a hiker may resume where they left off and have 12 months from their start date to complete their hike instead of just a 12 month period.     This will give people a chance to complete without having to hike in Maine in December.

That is where I was on your birthday.     Pretty rocky climb up Whitetop Mtn. To Buzzards Rock. Picked up 1500’ of altitude in about 2 miles. Took me over 2 hours due to the high rock steps. Some were over 18 inches high. Going down the other side was almost as bad.     Unable to get to next shelter but still had a pretty good day.     Some really impressive views on the top of Whitetop Mtn. Beautiful sunny day and you could see for miles.     Well thanks for keeping tabs on me and I’ll see you down the trail.,"Lost Mtn. Sheltet

Nimble,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/634511,Climb up Mt. Rogers from Deep Gap was very difficult for me. Lots of loose rocks and high steps. Took me two and half hours to go two miles.     The 5 miles at the end of the day were in Grayson Highlands State Park. At one point I had thought I had rebroken my left foot. Quite a bit of daylight but my foot was pretty sore and I was afraid to push it. As of this writing my foot seems OK.       Rocky is not the word for the last 5 miles. Climbed over solid rock formations and the trail was like walking down a path littered with   rock footballs. Footing for me was terrible.     I was hoping to have a really big day today and hit some big miles. But it is probably better to rest up and be able to continue walking tomorrow.     Well that’s about it for today. Thanks so much for all your support and encouragement.     See you down the trail.     The pony must have thought I was eating hay.,"Deep Gap

This is probably the best day of hiking I have done with all the ups and downs.     Foot seems to be doing OK. I don’t think it’s broke but I have gotten a sore on my foot. Am treating it aggressively and keeping it wrapped. Think it will be okay for now.       What really amazed me about today was that I had a full food load. However I had no water fo the last 3 and a half miles. That probably was the reason I was able to make the distance I did. I was surprised to walk that far and not even see a trickle coming down anywhere.      I also went up a very steep grade to see Comers Falls. Not as big as some but a very peaceful place to take a break. I was there all alone and had it all to myself.     Like to thank my wife Deloris for all the meals she dehydrates and sends to me.

The shelters are either too close or too far. Camping areas and water sources are sort of spread out too. That probably means you will have to carry more water.

They started doing section hikes together in 2019 and are northbound.         They plan on doing this until they go all the way to Maine. I want to wish them the best of luck.     Just remember in 10 years or so you’ll probably will have to invite a girlfriend. They grow up faster than you can believe. Good hiking!     Am now 1.1 miles from having the Smokies hiked. Other than my clear morning at Clingman’s  the rain kept this from being a great hike. Don’t think I’ll do the whole trail again but there are a couple of views I would like to see on a clear day.      Deloris is picking me up in the morning so I can make my dental appt.  Don’t know when I’m headed back to Shenandoah but I’ll keep you posted.     Thanks for hanging around and lending your support.

     Most of the climb is a boulder climb with a ladder rung and some metal studs for footholds thrown in. I get real slow in these situations due to the tenderness in my left foot. The placement of my left foot is critical in not injuring it again.

     Due to the length of my ascent I sent word down the mountain to my wife Deloris to meet me at Abol campground because the trail was 1.4 miles shorter.
     By the time I started my descent it was totally socked in. Visibility was less than 10 feet. It was raining making a very steep descent very slick.
     I was following a blue blaze trail down a boulder debris field. I could not see the blazes. I attempted to follow the discoloration of the trail but ended up at a dead end.

You go along the shore oh Nahmakanta Lake for quite awhile. (Picture above).

I said they felt really good but I might be getting a blister on the outside of my left foot. I wasn’t, it was the start of a stress fracture.  Bad, real bad.
     February 25, 2020. Torrential rain all night. Started hike under overcast skies and very cool temperatures. Second night out and I camped in an ice storm with about 50 mile an hour winds. Had never really been cold in my life. Thought I was going to freeze to death as wind whipped through tent. On the trail less than 48 hours and already headed to town to dry out and my left foot is starting to hurt.
     Alpert Mtn North Carolina. First real rock climb on AT. Poured down rain all the way up and all night when I got up there. Went up abandoned fire tower and almost broke glass to get out of driving rain. Decided to set up tent in driving rain. Everything got soaking wet including sleeping bag. For the second time in my life I am really cold. Remember, I fixed broken water mains in below zero temperatures and had never been this cold.
     Next morning went to scenic overlook and could see maybe 15’. About then my most favorite hiking hat blew into the mist. Thought this was the most stupid thing I had ever done and I decided to quit right then and there. Two hours later the clouds broke and the sun came out. The view was breathtaking. Decided to hang on.
    When I got to Fontana Dam,  the start of the Smokies, the skin peeled off my stress fracture revealing a nasty infection. Knew I had to go home, but now I didn’t want to. Knew if OK with my wife I would be back. 166 miles on a broken foot had made me more determined.
     Fast forward to 2021. First day back in Hot Springs, NC. Said good-bye to Deloris and set out with a new determination. Six hours later a wooden step broke and dropped me about 8 feet on my ass. More specifically my right hip. Hip was throbbing and I was walking with severe limp. Went to hostel and rested then set out with more determination.
     Throughout the rest of my hike I either had pain in my left foot or right hip. Sometimes both. I couldn’t sleep on my right hip and for some reason l now became more determined.
     Southern Virginia! Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee are behind me. Although I would suffer tendinitis in my left knee and spend the night without a tent and loose my glasses, I thought things were looking up. My mileage started going up. This is more like it. Then I tripped over a rock and peeled all the skin off my forehead. It really hurt and it made me push on.
    The placement of my left foot so I wouldn’t step on a “tomahawk” rock and rebreak the metatarsal took about a mph off my pace, but I still had a pace. This was not as planned but I continued on.
      You all know the Katahdin descent (Aug 5th). After that I started having real problems with my right knee. Actually had knee start collapsing and not supporting my weight. Really, really bad! Made the 100 Mile Wilderness really slow. I did finish however, but decided it was time to go home before I sustained a serious injury.
     Not re-living these events got sympathy or pity, but to convey the need for complete mental participation to even think about hiking the AT.

Nimble,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643401,"Yesterday was to show how taxing the AT can be. It is my sincere wish that the following remembrances be more uplifting. They won’t necessarily be in order they will be in the order they pop in my head.               Blood Mtn. Georgia:   The highest point in Georgia and a pretty good climb. It had snowed the night before and the ascent had some pretty slick places. When I got to the top it was my first 360 degree view since the weather had been so cloudy.  When I got up there it was just what I needed. Would not have another view like this until Albert Mtn. In North Carolina. To say it was uplifting is a great understatement. Walking up the next mountain you look back and realize what you have just climbed over. It gives you a great feeling of accomplishment.               Albert Mtn. North Carolina: Already told you about ascent and night spent on mountain, now the good part. The only real view prior to this had been Blood Mtn.  As I said yesterday I had decided to go home. Still soaking wet and the wind began to howl. Thought more rain was coming. Instead it blew the clouds out even most of those in the valleys below. Almost 100 miles in and I had my first totally unobstructed view of my surroundings. People ask me often if I don’t get tired of walking mostly alone. At this moment I was glad no one else was around. The vista was totally awe inspiring. I knew at that moment I would continue. Alone with my own thoughts and thinking of why I hiked I knew I would continue. For those who don’t think there is a power greater than ourselves, if you ever stand on a mountain top with a vista all around you and still feel that way, you need to examine your whole being.               Wayah Bald, NC: There is a stone observatory which surveys the valley below. Wayah means wolf in Cherokee and he was a great chief. His domain was this mountain and the valley below. The view below once again totally enthralled me.                The Smokies: Unfortunately it rained most of my hike in the Smokies. However I had a clear morning view at Clingman’s Dome. The sun had just risen in the east and the valleys were full of clouds. This view alone made the trip worthwhile.                Max Patch, NC: Hit this spot when I went back in June 2020 to try and continue my hike. Wanted to camp here but it got dark before my arrival. Arrived about one hour after sunrise but the sun had not cleared the mountains. As I stood there the sun appeared between two mountain tops. As the light splayed across the meadow I realized it was in full bloom. It then dawned on me that sometimes the vista was right at your feet.               Roan Mtn, Tn: First day I attempted this hike, rain was blowing horizontal to the ground and actually blew me into the bushes.The next day was gorgeous. You walk along a rock ridge for quite awhile and the view is breathtaking. So glad I waited a day. It was definitely worth the wait to see the mountains and valleys spread out below.     Ivy Creek Overlook Shenandoah: This is another of those “Did I just do that?” moments. You cross Ivy Creek in a deep valley then climb the next mountain. When you get up there you realize what you just did and you are sort of amazed. Did I mention the view of the valley is overwhelming?  You also have amazing views of the Shenandoah Valley from many locations in the Park.             Harpers Ferry, WV: When you get to the descent south of town it is straight down. The view of the Shenandoah River joining the Potomac River are breathtaking from the mountain top. Walking through the historic parts of town just warmed the cockles of this historian’s heart.             Maryland: Wanted to mention Maryland for all the historic markers they display. Some very nice vistas, but the state’s emphasis on its history was really pleasant for me. To realize I was walking in the footprints of some great Americans and some not so great, was inspiring for me and shows the importance of knowing how we got here.             Katahdin: Tough, tough ascent and really rough descent. By the time I got to the top it was pretty socked in. I contemplated a lot of things as I sat on the summit. How my wife and children mean so much to me and I don’t think I show it. How I wish they were here with me to share this moment. My living Grandchildren that they will have good and Happy lives. And my late Grandson who helped inspire to get here.     I also had another thought. I was trying to help my mother move a piece of furniture one time when I asked her to move and just let me do it.   In her most vocal tone she said “Just because I’m 70 don’t think I can’t do things. I sure wish I could be around to see how you’re doing at 70”.     Well Mom I don’t know if you noticed, but I climbed a 5,268’ rock pile and sat on the summit.Oh by the way, I’m 70.             Maine: With my knee not wanting to work this became an even more difficult hike. The north 30 miles of the “Wilderness” were absolutely spectacular. You are almost always near a mountain lake or stream. Even though I was struggling this was still a great hike. I have no regrets about flip-flopping up to Maine.             Overall Thoughts: There were so many moments like the ones above they are just to many to enumerate. Gorgeous sunrises and sunsets. Vistas that almost overwhelm you.     Walking the first three miles in Maryland along the Potomac River which at this point is a mountain river strewn with huge boulders. Or watching a hawk in Virginia ride the thermal currents higher than the mountain you are on and then glide back to the valley. Only flapped his wings twice to make the turn.     Like I said before I really don’t know what keeps you going sometimes. But I feel really blessed that it found me.     Until tomorrow I’ll see you down the trail.","N/A

Nimble,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/643474,"First my motivation to get off the couch and start this hike was my Grandson above. As many of you know he only lived 8 months. A charity called “Lincoln’s Legacy” was set up to help fund Liver research at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.     Since I walked a total of 1300 miles I am asking those who have not contributed to give me .01 cent per mile. That would be a donation of $13.00. Any amount above that would be greatly appreciated.     Please contact my son at: John.lancaster.spurrier@gmail.com or call him at (513) 400-2225. Your generosity will not be forgotten.     Secondly, I went to the doctor this week and found my knee problems stem from arthritis. No permanent damage, no need for surgery or other invasive procedures at this time. For this I am truly thankful. All other test were excellent. My biggest problem was loss of weight and muscle mass. Once I gain a LITTLE weight back I should be in pretty good shape.     Now about the hike. It is only fair to say this adventure was a real journey. Since I spent most of the time walking alone due to my slow pace, I had much time to contemplate many things.     As John Lennon said: “Life is what happens while you are making other plans”. I really can’t say I have a lot of regrets about my life, but there are things I would change if I could. The biggest of these is I would work less and spend more time with my wife and children. Ah! The universal lament.            If transference of experiences were an option, I would wish to convey to anyone who has never experienced solitude on a mountain top the depth of soul searching that you can achieve. To push yourself to climb a mountain just to go down the other side becomes your way of life. And believe it or not, each becomes an experience on to itself.     The trail community is like no other I have ever encountered. For the large majority they exist to revel in the hike. There are a few real weirdos out there, but for the most part they are really good people in search of an adventure which most people will never know. I place myself in this category. Moving outside the lines to achieve a sense of exhilaration that you won’t get in very many situations.     Once again, there is no way to explain the unrelenting desire you obtain as you hike the AT or any other major trail for that matter. I really wish I could, but this endeavor must be done individually to understand the motivation. You either get it or you don’t.     Ranking my AT travels in my life’s important moments is sort of difficult. It is definitely in my top 5 but not near as important as the 42 years I have spent with my wife. Nor is it more important than my children and my grandchildren. I truly hope that the things in my life I most cherish will remain in my focus from now on.     Once again there are so many people to thank for supporting and encouraging me to carry on. At this juncture I had planned on thanking a few individually. I decided not to. For if you contacted me many times or just once, so many times it was that little touch that kept me going.     The Appalachian Trail! That phrase will hold for me many cherished memories that will last the rest of my life. People I met, new friends, vistas that took my breath away, and the knowledge that we are truly insignificant in the overall scheme of things.     It is still my hope to finish the AT one day. At this point in time I am not sure of the process that will make this happen. Only time will tell. Thanks once again to all who took the time to support and encourage me.     And until I figure out a way to continue this adventure I’ll see you down the trail.","N/A

Enjoy your holiday season and enjoy your family and friends.          I have tried to focus on one great memory but there are so many it just wasn’t possible. Isn’t it great to have such a dilemma. I hope all of you have such feelings about your journey.       To those of you who only followed along and lended support, thank you for your time and consideration. As I have stated many times before when I felt defeated there would be that text or email that helped me continue on.     Thanks again to all of you and may the New Year bring you great happiness and joy. Truly the greatest gifts anyone can receive. See you down the trail.","N/A

Heat is just sapping me,      Have decided to let heat break a little before coming back.     Nobody is more disappointed than I am, but I would rather wait than head to Pa. and not be able to accomplish anything.     Keep checking here for updates and I’ll see you down the trail.","N/A

I just wish I had it in me to do more but I don’t.      Still hope I get to see more of you somewhere down the trail.      Thanks again for all your support and know how much I have enjoyed this experience.,"Swatara Gap
