gbolt ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666968,"Said goodbye to the Green Mtns. as we passed the LT/AT Trailhead on Rt. 9 to head to Millinocket Maine. Of course when pulling out at 7:30 a.m., our bellies were full with coffee, over easy eggs and bacon cooked to perfection and buttered toast!  The eight hour trip with stops for rest, coffee, and gas went so smoothly as we travelled the interstate.  Soon traffic slowed as we got further north. I am sure Recon thought, ""Is this guy ever going to shut up!"".  It was truly out of joy and excitement to be hiking this final section of the Appalachian Trail with Recon.  I already am in a better mindset than in 2021. The last rest stop before Medway was almost empty, had heavy lids to keep critters out of the trash cans and a No Potable Water. A sign that we were close to our final stop.  The Appalachian Trail Hostel.  I am sure the drive was hard on Recon, but I am glad that I haven't done that for over a week.  It is one of the major tech advances to lose in order to slow to the hikers pace of travel. Recon parked the car for the final time and I checked us in. A quick tour of the bunk options and rules of stay and we were left to our minimal camp chores.  Mainly pulling out a clothing bag and using it to claim a lower old guys bunk.  They are comfortable and the place is a little warm with 86* outside weather, but fans or roar sting and they are trying to push hot air out. Quick nap by Recon gave us both a chance to elevate legs for better hiking tomorrow. I believe I am truly Keeping the Faith and am so honored to be hiking with Recon.  Without a doubt, he is a stronger hiker than I and so knowledgeable on trail that I learn from him and am inspired by him daily.  Next to my wife, I am sure he is the only one that can put up with me long term. I can't believe that I have been blessed to have shared the trail with him since the hundred mile mark at Albert mountain, five years ago.  He saw me through Sickness in Pa, self doubt after a fall in after the Lemon Squeezer, Restored Hope in the Green Mtns, Pulled me through the Whites, and finally turned me over to RTK (Return to Katahdin) to send us both to the finish when he couldn't, not out of weakness but out of strength to one day claim his rightful finish. If the hiking boots were switch and I faced what he did, I would have never come back once, much less twice to get it done!  So it is a huge honor to get invited share in Recons AT Hike.
Additional Story:  on the way out of the hostel for dinner, Recon came across another hiker laying on a bunk. The usual Nobo, SoBO type of talk led to this hiker discussing that her had a myocardial infarction earlier in his hike that had forced him back to Texas. Pass military service meant he had to go through his VA there.  He's up here to provide trail magic in the HMW for his brother that continued hiking and is probably set to finish his journey. Recon thanked him for his service and you could tell he was a humble yet strong individual that couldn't believe that he was off trail and the doctors urging him not to hike at all!  Recon shared his very similar Avib story and I was blessed to witnessed a God Moment; were these two individuals crossed paths at just the right moment to impact one or another at a higher level of shared commonality or humanism!",,View Entry,"Jul 17, Mon",0
gbolt ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667009,"Up early in the Millinocket AT Hostel, Honeymoon Phase for the start of this Journey with Recon!  8:00 departure for Stratton Maine couldn't come soon enough. However, at 8:07 I began Praying to the Good Lord to Lead the way and make things go smoothly. Shortly thereafter, our Shuttle Driver Sammy pulled up and popped the trunk, for our packs.  So it began! Well after a brief stop at McDonalds for Recons coffee and breakfast.  Sammy drives a 2006 Subaru much more stout than even my 2010.  Conversation flowed and it was a relaxed trip, although the 3 hour drive seemed like 5.  Finally, we passed the Hostel of Maine where our last attempt was cut short by a family emergency.  Soon we pulled in the Rt. 27 Trail Head.  After, PayPal, a small Tip and our good byes we headed NoBo across the road. Adrenaline carried us the1st mile quickly and we felt like pros when we passed a summer camp of very young hikers.  When asked where they were headed for the day, one girl told me Georgia!  One day I am sure she well do just that.  Another, after hearing Recons story told him, ""You Got This!"".  We were hiking so well we thought we may even get the other side of Avery Peek.  Silly me, forgetting that Maine will humble you quickly!! The uphill climb actually became a Rock Scramble, using hand to hand pull ups more than poles.  On top of that, the rain started.  Solid drenching rain.  Yet, it caused me to focus and forget hiking speed or any pain moving up the mountain. Just about the time we had enough, the sky would lighten even so lightly as if God were saying, ""Keep the Faith, I've got you!""  The. Just to ensure we knew, a few rumbles of ending Thunder would roll as an exclamation. We continue to climb, hit the top of the trail but skipped the summit. Headed for a sharp down,  slight up and then it flattened out. Finally, got to a lean too that had 3 side benches but no center floor.  I was a little depressed, don't know about Recon.  Turns out, it was built in 1936 and now serves as a day use facility. Recon headed on back deeper and finally we came to not just one but two Lean Toos. Got water as soon as the packs came off, in order to beat the next round of storms worse than the first.  Thunder rolled as I finished filling the dirty water bag.  Of course, Recon was already done and heading back, but it gave me a moment for a silent prayer of thanks and the realization that God's Timing is always correct.  Recon had a clothes line stung so we started getting dry, dinner and set up for the night.  SoBos slowly wondered down of the mountain telling harried stories of the storm on the peak of the biggest mountain that we can see from our shelter for the night.  They all took the second lean to, which is great for us!  We, will actually Recon figured milage and we created a plan for tomorrow and possibly the next two nights with better weather in the forecast!  It's off to bed according to each individual age, with Faith and Hope for a great tomorrow! ","Maine Rt 27

gbolt ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667133,"I don't know what it is about our first night on trail, but at Seth Warner we had torrential downpours.  Wouldn't you know it, last night at Horn Pond Lean To we also had major torrential rain!  Luckily the forecast for today was a good one.  We needed it to get above tree line and cross about four peaks.  It is awesome to be on top of a mountain and Loki g all the way around in a 360!  We were in the clouds but waited for a clearing  before the view disappeared only for a different on to open up.  We really didn't want to leave but forced ourselves to the next and next.  Avery Peak was great because of plaques honoring this pioneer AT Forefather!  The other cool thing is to look backwards at the peaks you've just crossed.  Recon hiked out to a view for lunch that did just that as well as being able to see off the cliff below to the Flagstaff Lakes!  What a way to dine!  We felt great but Maine would humble us in the afternoon.  Up, over, around, down, back up to repeat the process to get over little bigelow, the lowest elevation of them all.  The dreaded .7 left to go took for ever! The worse milage of all!  Yet, we were blessed with some awesome views, especially over to Sugarloaf Mountain. It is also fun to get a break from the ups or downs with granite slabs to hike on.  Spots to find blueberries as well although. Recon said it was still a little early and the taste isn't quite right.  Finally we hit the top of little Bigelow and it was just a sign in some trees with no view at all!  Then the long, long, descent down to the Little Bigelow Lean To. It has a  Flowing river to rinse off dirt and soak sore bodies. It is also so gong a lullaby to lure us to sleep.  Tough day but what views! Pictures just don't do them justice.  We are hoping to make miles tomorrow to set up a Hostel on Friday.  Trying to Keep the Faith because Maine is tough.  Yet by saying Bye to the Bigelows, we have hiked the toughest mountains until Mama K.","Horn Pond Lean To

gbolt ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667135,"Todays weather was perfect but it brought out the bugs. We made good time down hill, leaving the Bigelow Lean To, until we hit a two mile uphill Slosh Fest. Can't complain, for Maine this was awesome terrain. Soft pine needle stretches until you get close to a pond and then it's a three for one special: Roots, Rocks and Mud. Recon's second trail name could have been Zip, the way he handles the special for the day. Zip-Zip-Zip and he is off and up the trail. While I am back there with the Trail Name Snap, Crash, and Splash. Even with wonderful Bog planks and even Boardwalks, I struggled along.  I also had Fall Number Three when I Slipped on a plank, right trekking pole into the mud and I could get my Rt hand out of it or pull it out of the muck.  Luckily, I was on the left side of the plank so only my legs and thighs went for a swim. I laid across the board, keeping my pack dry and safe, I until I could beach myself like a seal!  The only thing that came out of the pack was a water bottle and the only damage was to my trekking pole that was bent sacrificing itself for me.  Although, if my hand hadn't been threw the strap I do t know if that would have made it better or worse. Usually, my left is the one I strap. Oh well, must have been a sight for Recon!  I joked that I couldn't wait till the beach to swim!  The trail is pretty busy with a couple of NoBo's that blew past us. Some SoBo's that are usually going after miles and can't really talk. Although we had a couple that stopped and asked how long the special was going to last going South.  They also congratulated Recon on being so close to his finish. I ignored it because I don't want to think about it until Monson.  The other cool thing worth noting was a group of Girls hiking South. The leader stepped to the side and called out to the others to do the same.  Recon started chatting and asked what the group was doing. We recounted our experience with a similar group five years ago at the NH/Maine State-line.  The leader said she was on that trip (probably 12 or 13 and look at her now)!  We quit at 4:00 thinking why push it when we have this lovely stealth sight with flowing water to put us asleep again.  Although the bus were a little bad, Recon took care of me by sharing aerosol bug spray that works better than my pump bottle. I'm lucky he is carrying my rear up the trail with him and never saying a word!  So excited to be sharing his journey with him!  We are staged will for the Kennebec River Crossing and a Nero into The Sterling Inn Tomorrow. Not even dark and I'm beat and ready for sleep.","Little Bigelow Lean Two

gbolt ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667144,"Restful night sleep and up before the 5 am alarm.  The Stream provided white noise that we didn't realize the volume of until we moved farther north up the trail. Although we did wake to the Vermont state bird - The Hermit Thrush. I had tried since 2018 to figure this bird from its song. It sounds like the old carnival tubes that we swung around as kids to make a whistling, whirling sound.  I mentioned it to Recon and he understood my insane description immediately!  Now my favorite bird in competition with the Cardinal of course!  Hiking started the way it ended, with alternating pine soft tread (plus roots) with water logged rocks and mud.  Recon is so keen eyed that he did find Fresh Moose Tracks instead of the usual Weeks to month old signs! Really Cool! We made pretty good time to the Pierce Pond Shelter which was busy with activity. We took a break but moved on to get to the Ferry. We took a look at the Dam Crossing but it was more like a huge waterfall with two separate flows. We and everyone we talked to went the blue blaze to the Harrison's Pierce Pond Camp with a bridge over the Pierce Pond Stream. Once across, we followed that Raging Stream all the way down to the Kennebec.  They call them Cascades, but they were roaring and thundering, waterfall after waterfall!  We had one swift Brook feeding into this river that was difficult to cross but we made it with only one shoe wet.  There was also one portion that went along the stream but was under water long enough for another trail to start forming slightly uphill.  Locals say that this is the highest water levels since the North Kennebec River dam was built. Finally we turned a corner and saw the river below.  Slight set of steps and we were at the river edge, waiting for the Canoe delivery to paddle over to us.  Legal waivers, life jackets, and packs into the canoe followed by Recon in front and me in the middle. Recon paddled with our ATC Maine Guide who went up river in slower water to ride back south to the pullout spot on the east side, safe and sound. 200 Hundred feet up the trail and we were at US  201 and waiting on a shuttle to Sterling Inn. Nothing like a shower, laundry, and restaurant food to make a person feel human again!  We shared a ride and a meal with NoBo Hiker from Belgium. Yet we all seemed to order Fish and Fries at Three Rivers  Trading Post.  Boy was that place hopping!  The rest of the day spent off feet, chatting to other hikers and thinking of resupply for the next section. Most important of all, a phone call to the home front.  Can't imagine how much I miss my wife but so glad she let me go for this adventure.  I know Recon feels the same!  Stayed up too late, splitting a pizza with Recon then Ben and Jerry's 
mice cream while chatting with a Columbus Hiker that Graduated with an Engineering Degree from University of Dayton. Small world. He hiked the PCT, moved to Colorado and is now experiencing the AT. Good time sharing stories. The next section could be difficult...we meet a SoBO named Hendricks (Like in Jimmy, with a Buff to match) that talked about a work around to a river 4x's higher than normal.  With off and on showers this afternoon, and more expected tomorrow, it doesn't seem to be lowering any.  I am just trying to Keep the Faith and Keep HikN^ with Recon.","Carrying Place Stream​ Mile 150.2
",US Rt. 201 Sterling Inn,"Jul 21, Fri",7.50
gbolt ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667289,"The Day started well for me.  Coffee, followed by Toast, Cereal, Banana and washed down with Apple Juice.  Recon didn't slept all that well and then had Brace problems.  But we got off ok on a shuttle back to the Trailhead with three NoBo's that we will never see again. Sterling Inn was a great Nero, timed out just right. Love when time just flows and the trail (God) provides. We started off great, knocking of miles.  Then we hit a mile and a half straight climb!  Recon was gone, except one spot where the trail cut back to the left. He shouted from above to make sure I didn't miss it. Bless him!  At the top, I joked that the tortoise was faster than me, but I did beat the hare because I didn't stop!  Getting a little stronger, or maybe just the Nero helped a great deal.  Recon was picking Blueberries at the top, so I joined him.  Some are getting good.  Then the views were excellent, as we peaked over the top of the rock summit.  Decided to eat lunch and Recon said, ""Bet Mountain Goat (Columbus, and UD) well come bounding along any moment"".  Darned if not more than two minutes there he was, asking if he could lunch with us.  Cool time but when we finished and put the packs on, he was gone forever.  The afternoon took forever.  Portions of the trail were good, followed by muck, mud, rocks, roots and water. Just hard to get any type of tempo going. Plus, water that was so plentiful on the other side of the mountain in the morning, was now non existent. Recon finally cupped some flowing trail water while I watched. Then I thought better and said I should have gotten some instead of standing around.  He said, ""Stuff is still out if you need it"".  So patient, and the 1/4 bottle did save me.  Plus the Tannins give me my daily minerals. A little later, Recon prophesied the rain and said we should put on pack covers to drive it away.  Sure enough it started before we got them put on.  I Told him he is more correct than the TV weather man.  The rain would continue on and off until we hit the shelter with intermittent bouts of Sunshine. Just the good Lord playing hide and seek with the Sun behind clouds. We hit a road at a huge pond and turned right.  The pond was being feed by a river up above.  Two ladies, waiting on a friend that was completing a twenty mile SoBo, gave us the low down on other hikers and Boy Scouts that had crossed the river previously. I just followed Recons lead and enjoyed the water rushing at knee level. That got the adrenaline going but again short lived. Finally we heard the scouts and trekked up to the Shelter to get out of our wet cloths.  Would have maybe Camped out but the sites are so limited. A group of NoBo Thru's showed up so we are sharing the shelter now. One girl, Bambi is from Belgium and the one guy is from Sunbury Ohio!  Small world.  There conversation. goes and goes, while Recon and I are ready for bed.  We well rise early before them if we continue the rule of age.  Hoping the mosquitoes go to sleep and the mice stay away from things. We need a good nights sleep for a couple of more deep River Crossings Tomorrow.  ","US Rt. 201 Sterling Inn
",Bald Mountain Brook Lean To,"Jul 22, Sat",14.70
gbolt ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667290,"Got the earliest start out of the shelter that we may have ever had. Bambi and Bear Bait had just woken, the difference between youth and age.  Bear Bait said he slept better than he had previously in a shelter.  He said, "" You know what to expect when you chose to share with two old guys!  Why the nerve of him! Lol. We started a climb and I was just flat out struggling.  Not in a good mood at all.  Recon said he had a great sleep and was ready.  Good thing I thought.  Needed him to balance me out.  We hike through ""The Cave"", a short but cool rock feature.  We had views of the pond below and mountains in the distance that I should have appreciated more, but the climb, which was much shorter and easier than yesterday.  What a day makes. Finally, we hit rock slab signifying the Summit is just ahead.  I started to see the sun shining over cairns that shown around Recon hiking ahead!  When we got close to the top, there were packs and people from the camping area below last night, sitting and watching the finish of a sunrise. Recon chatted with them a little later on, which was cool to witness. I decide to put an ear bud in and listen to music to keep my bad mood to myself. As we walked up to the Moxie Bald Sign, the first song was The Old Rugged Cross!  While taking in the 360 degree view, Carrie Underwood sang, How Great Thou Art!  Right then and there, I had the best Sunday Sermon in quite awhile.  Recon stated he didn't want to leave and I was in agreement.  But leave we must, yet the Service continued a little more down the hill until we dropped far enough to leave the slate Rock. However, my attitude had been changed.  Once we got down, the path was smooth and we  hiked at a good pace until hunger kicked in right at the Bald Stream crossing even though it was just a little past 10:30 we decided on Sunday Brunch in the sun on the rocks watching others cross the calf deep stream. Finished eating and packed, soon it was our turn. A little easier than yesterday's 1st crossing. A stream is always I. A depression, so you go down and then back up.  On the next down hill I had Fall Number Two. Wet left foot on a long downhill root, with my right in stride and no way to stop the slide, until sitting on my butt and pack. Luckily not brain injury!  Picked myself up continued on to catch Recon. I think he slows up the pace for me, at times. Much appreciated and such a humble man in the way he thinks about people and issues in life. Mid afternoon we hit the 3rd River crossing, second of the day.  This was one that had swept people away, a week ago and was chest high, 4x what it should be. There was a 7+ mile work around and a choice to hike into Buchannon and road walk all the way to Monson from there.   Early on we were told about this being a good choice.  But recent SoBo's and Kelly from yesterday convinced us that they were all doable, and the two earlier had worked out well. We prepped by putting away phones and Fanny backs, while also unbuckling our pack straps. Recon led the way and talked me through it, stressing three points of contact with poles and one solid foot. Down stream a little then back up against the current sideways and across to an island that cut the flow into two upstream.  Taking a break on island land and then back into the upper thigh water to finish the Crossing. The water was warm and letting back on it with Recons instruction, it was a cool experience.  We hiked up and over, following the W Branch Piscataquis River to our right all the way to the canyon below.  When I started the late afternoon drag, Recon stopped and pointed to the other side of the Canyon too a beautiful Waterfall tumbling and flowing down to the River below. A mile from camp we both listen to music to get us home, cutting our hike short.  Nothing to gain, because it will be a quick 7 mile Nero into Monson tomorrow.  There is still the E. Branch of the River to cross as well.  We pulled in and set up camp next to the family of six that we chatted with at Sterling Inn. Hopeful made us afternoon Coffee as we shared some more stories. The. Recon and I headed down to the river for a dip. Of course Recon went all in, while I just soaked mud thighs. The biting horseflies chanced me away and probably cut Recons swim short. Then up back up to filter water from an upper small Brook for the night.  We were invited to share dinner at the shelter with our Michigan to Virginia new found family.  They are Thru Hikers, Hostel Owners and very familiar with the Appalachian Trail. It was an awesome time of fellowship that included the youngest to Recon, the Oldest!  The family is a well rubbed machine with everyone pitching in and great attitudes all around. The oldest is a sixteen year old that just learned to drive. Unusual to see a teenage flow from adults down to her siblings and never miss a beat.  The oldest son has a Warbonnet Hammock that he bought and outfitted himself.  He has learned all the knots in order to get an awesome hang.  Soon  enough Hopeful gave the command to brush teeth and we were on our way to our hammocks and tent. Recon said it was one of the best days on trail ever and I wholeheartedly agree.","Bald Brook Mountain Lean To

gbolt ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667291,"Morning was a relaxing pack up out of Camp.  On Trail at 6:20 thinking Seven miles into Monson was quite doable and we would make good time. Of course Maine had other ideas. We saw a Beaver Hut that had the damn situated so that water was backing up nicely for the  Leave it to Beaver Family.  Then we had the climb for the day.  Nothing major, a four hundred footer I think.  I just couldn't get the energy going. Couldn't find a gear and slowed to step by slow step. The mosquitoes were faster and relentless, making matters even more tough in the hot humid morning Sun.  But you can't complain about the weather we have been having. Finally, crested the Top and drank the rest of my water, with Lunch at a view that Recon - Reconned again!  Then we started downhill through a maze of blown downed trees.  None of which you could step over or under, but had to belly crawl under one and limbo on your buttocks for the others. The hardest part was getting back on the feet to stand up.  Looked like a turtle rolling over from its shell!  However, we flew down the downhill from there!  Fastest slalom ever!  By the time I caught Recon, he was already pulling out his Sawyer and Bag to fill up for the last time.  Luckily, he filled mine because I had run dry trying to make it the last three+ miles but fell a mile - mile and a half short!  It was nice and cold!  We tried to keep up the good speed but another slight up took it out of me. Recon could run circles around me with his stride and bionic Knee brace, but he waits patiently and insures I'm doing well. Just a great guy.  For example, last night a hiker was having knee issues, so Recon gave him the knee sleeve that he occasionally wears. Didn't think a thing of it and didn't care if he got it back.  This evening, I see a note that said, ""Recon, Thanks for the brace and help!""  Our last mile to Rt 15 was smooth to the road.  Arrived at 11:35 for the 12:00 Shuttle.  Got the tour, instructions and found our beds in the bunkhouse.  Showered and I found some loaner clothes that actually fit ok and look good enough. Hunger was next and we ended up in a Country Store that had great deli sandwiches. The All American Thanksgiving Turkey on sour dough bread won the day for both of us!  We looked over and here is a hiker with a huge double scoop ( more like triple) on a cone.  It was all in his beard and across his face but it sure looked good.  So we hit that up next.  I put mine in a cup no cone though. In between lunch and ice cream we went to the ATC headquarters because they close mid week. Boy that lady knows her stuff but don't stop her, or let her lose her place because she will start that section of speech all over again!  And NO Disparaging Remarks!! We have a good understanding of what to do to get stay at The Birches prior to climbing Katahdin. Still a ways off though. She gave us our 2023 Bag Tags as well. Walking back past the Country Store, I walked past a Ram Van (Life) and saw two people in it.  I took two steps and said, ""Hey Recon, that looked like Hawk. Recon turned around and walked back while the driver come around the front. Recon goes, ""Hey Hawk, Hi Kathy. Turns out the two stayed a night at Recon's house in Shaftesbury.  Small world for sure. Finally, back at the hostel we had to wait about 15 minutes for the washer to free up and then kill an hour to complete laundry with the drying. I made the mistake of going to the Gear shop!  Replace my DIY bottle and tubing system for a strap bottle holder.  The old system served me well, but is not as efficient as Recons techniques.  I also gave in and bought a pair of Green Feet Insoles that Poet cut to size for me.  I am hoping that some of the foot conditions and soreness will improve with the better support in my trusted Solomons.  We went back to the store for Salads and Sour Cream Chips for me. It was so filling I didn't even finish the last little bet. Conversation was good with a Father / Son (30yr old) team that started March 1st and are about to finish.  The father was the same one that enjoyed the ice cream in his beard earlier. Now it's time to call Joanie. Recon had a good conversation when he had reception and I didn't, early this morning. She had sent a pic of 2 quarts of Raspberries from the yard that look delicious!  I know neither of us would be out here if it weren't for the loving Support of these strong woman at home. So today has been a day of Blessings. Tomorrow we stay for a Zero Day before the HMW.","Horseshoe Canyon Lean To

Of course Recon got up with age as usual and was chatting with another older couple. We ended up eating the breakfast with them and a gentleman named Ace from Yellow Springs, OH. Three eggs (instead of my usual one), 2 Strips of Bacon and Fried Potatoes, washed down with Juice and Coffee was almost too much to eat. However, I did force almost a complete Blueberry Pancake down. Recon could have put a hurtin on those but no Vt Maple Syrup. Once you have the best, you can go back!  Lazy morning watching everyone part, giving way to relatively more quiet time.  Then a trip to the gas station back up to the Country Store for Resupply items. Sat drinking coffee and prepared a card for home that I mailed later at the Post Office. Back to Shaws to finish the Resupply but Hippie Chick was closing it to get time with the kids.  They have to keep to a schedule or they will never have a life.  Stayed off feet for an hour until Rueben Sandwiches and Chips called our name. Sat at a Gazebo and Chatted with a guy that did part of the CDT and was actually in some YouTube's by Spielberg (Former AT Thru Hiker). Finally, returning to Shaws in a brief rain shower.  Finished our Resupply and tried to figure out how much to pack out and how much to put into a food drop so we don't have to carry the weight. Planning the Drop date is difficult, but they can make adjustments when you text from the Top of White Cap Mountain.  The last significant one till Katahdin.  Squared up our Bill to avoid the rush in the morning (all necessary but expensive) to insure our shoes, gear and food get us to the end. HMW at 6-8 Days is one of the longest sections without a stop. There is one called The White House Landing across a Lake, but most hikers just keep passing thru. Got my Bent Leki Pole repaired under Warranty.  It did snap as we tried to straighten it.  All good now and it collapse, which is nice when not using or traveling.  Finished the Town Chores by Back Flushing the Sawyer Squeeze Water Filter.  It takes time to flush three times, bang the sides to work dirt and grit loose and flush three times, repeating until clear water rushes out backwards.  Time spent her doing this, saves time and increases flow at a stream on trail!  Finally, Dinner at a nearby Pub. Huge Burger and Fries. I skipped the Caesar Salad and of course Recon raved about the dressing and shredded cheese.  I hope he appreciates the sacrifices I make. If I had ordered it, it would have sucked! Place was busy but great WiFi so we didn't care.  Then a walk back to Shaws watching a Thunderstorm roll in, hoping it rolls out just as quick for our departure in the Morning.","Monson Maine

The real kicker was when he thrw a shirt over the fan blocking air movement in both directions and increased the noise to a deafening level.  Some one that knew him, told hi and he took it off with Recon Shouting Thank You! I think Recon had a special place for his flashlight though! Lol.   We walked to the Country General Store for Breakfast Sandwiches at 6:30.  That place has been awesome for food and Drinks.  Chocolate Milk was cold and good! Back to Shaws to wait for the Shuttle.  They ended up having 3-4, with us snatching the 2nd one.  Poet does a nice job sharing some knowledge for day one hiking and some inspiration for the last of the Journey Northbound.  We hit the Warning Sign, Registered and entered the HMW.  It is different than the other side of the road.  More Rugged and the rocks changed.  I had Fall Number 3, I think, but I am going to quit counting because it's almost daily.  Foot slide down the rock face and the only choice is to land on the right or left butt cheek!  The rock is very similar to the brick color of our fireplace.  Now I can sit at home and think of ""The Pain - In the Buttocks - of Maine! It was a rolling trail with Roots, Rock and Mud with no way to get a rhythm going.  I feel energized enough and well fueled, but my knees are and lower legs are the issue.  My left side is worse than the right, but both are swollen, even after a Zero.  Recon gave me the brace that he had used before he settled on his high quality brace. I did t put it on today but plan to use it tomorrow.  I need to get support for hopping down and trusting the foot will stay where it's placed.  It's frustrating because 1 mph isn't going to cut it!  That's about what we averaged today and cut the day way short of the intended target lean to. We did get to experience Wilson Falls down through a Gorge.  It's the Tallest Waterfall on the AT and is pretty cool.  We had to Cross the Wilson Creek down below and that felt good on the lower legs.  The. Up and over a small mountain with a couple of nice views.  Down to another Water Crossing to get to the first Shelter. It was here we decided to call it a day.  So we went for a swim before the crossing.  Wonderful water hike with the rapids massaging our backs!  It was rejuvenating.  Then the climb up to the shelter following a Summer Camp of Boys. They were all at the shelter and told us that they were moving to the next road crossing for the night.  That's the site we had debating going to but now glad we stayed behind in this area shelter.  No real options for Tenting, Sadly enough. Our Spielberg Guest hiker from Yesterday is also in here for the night.  Sad that we got here so early.  Dinner and chores are all done so Recon has resorted to watching a Shelter Ground Squirrel for entertainment, trying to stay awake for awhile.  I am trying to get advil to kick in and planning on sleeping with my head towards the shelter opening to get blood flow out of the legs.  Hoping tomorrow is a better day with longer miles to make up for the 4 miles we didn't complete today.  As Recon says, Tomorrow is another Day! I just keep praying my knees, shins and feet hold out for this second trip through the HMW.  Have to really Keep the Faith and Keep HiKN^!","
",Wilson Valley Lean To,"Jul 26, Wed",10.40
gbolt ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667660,"Up and on Trail at 5:30 Ready to make some miles.  Maine had other  ideas.  Crossed a cool Talus Field (Rock Slide basically) and worked our way to a couple of river crossings.  My left leg is really swollen and tender. At the second stream crossing we had to take off shoes so Recon soaked his knees and I soaked my shins. It really help, along with the knee brace, to get me through the day.  Recon also gave me Vitamin I and Tylenol at Lunch and it worked well too!  But the day was the. Filled with ups and downs. Of course more ups, but either direction was rock scrambles! We passed a beautiful water fall that was smaller than yesterday's but still awesome. Then we hit the SoBo's 100 mile sign!  Shortly there after, we discovered the two 2100 mile markers.  One in stone and one in sticks.  This is huge for Recon!  That many miles on the AT needs to be celebrated!  My word for Recon reaching this point is ""Tenacity""!  His Journey is one that he has stuck to through so many obstacles, especially being the strongest hiker I know!  We climbed up to Barren Ledges and had a view below.  Cloudy and sprinkling lightly so it would be the only one of the day. There was a new section that was very well laid out. It worked over to a small aircraft plane crash.  The two men made it down the mountain and lived so nothing morbid about it.  We ate lunch and Recon mentioned that the forecast called for Harder rain mainly between 2:30 and 4:30.  Sad to say he was right.  Probably about 3/4 of an inch too!  We just sloshed our way through.  Trail was a stream i parts and puddled ponds  in other!  Nothing easy about it. Had to embrace the Suck of it, but it wasn't easy!  I slowed to a snails pace and Recon would wait up ahead for me to catch up.  It truly was misery!  One of my toughest days on a trail ever.  Soaked to the bone and although the rain has stopped for the night, it's still dripping all over everything.  The shelter was full so we set up a little distance away by ourselves.  We cooked in our Vestibules and now its immediately to bed.  Hoping tomorrow is a brighter easier day. ","
",Chair Back Gap Lean To ,"Jul 27, Thu",15.70
gbolt ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667661,"1st thing Recon discussed this morning was a need to reconsider our Resupply and move it from Sunday to Saturday at a closer location. He had it all worked out, just need to contact Shaws.  We climbed up to finish the Chairbacks and we had awesome morning views. He also had cell service so he was able to make the changes. Shaws was very accommodating and we were set at that point.  Now it was just a matter of splitting the milage over two days and insuring we ate at the drop off point by 3 pm.  The descent down Chair Backs was grueling.  I remembered the Turn Left sign from 2018.  One of the few things I did recall. However, Blueberries were plentiful below and we gorged on what we could. We had a River crossing early on. Wide but not fast and we both had to find a place to soak lower legs. Most of the day was spent in The Gulf Hages  Region that includes the Hermitage (a group of 100 year old White Pines). The place Trail is beautiful and the one are two waterfalls we saw, were Gorgeous!  But the. The day dragged on as we climbed Gulf Hages Mountain which of course had no view.  We dropped into Sidney Tappan Campground at 3:30. Check FarOut because it felt to early and decided to tack on miles, even though it meant a water carry to dry camp. The spring was really flowing through a pipe so it was easy filling up. However the added miles were tough, over West Peak and Hay Mountain. Again no Views.  I must admit the trail was well laid out with switch backs and steps. Someone even said it was Maines version of Amicalola Falls back at the approach Trail. In true Mai e fashion, I would say these are tougher. We did make it to a camp site and during dinner, joined by another hiker that is flipping Southbound now. He read the same comments in FarOut for this place. Glad to be here and in bed. Tomorrow we climb over White Cap, the last Mountain until Katahdin!  Moving closer with each step!","
",Stealth Spot 2124.5,"Jul 28, Fri",14.60
gbolt ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667662,"Day started Early, with a climb to White Face.  Some beautiful views back SoBO, but wasn't expecting much on top.  I was Wrong.  The view to the Southeast was wonderful. Sat for awhile and had just enough signal to text Joanie. Then we decided we had had enough and ended around the mountain. Suddenly, Recon shouted, ""What's That?""!  Off to the East was one Mountain so much Taller than the rest. The cloud back was wrapped like a Ribbon below it.  The profile of its peak, unlike any other!  It was the great and my ghetto mountain - Katahdin!  I'm sure pictures won't do it justice but hopefully they turn out in the background behind us!  We didn't want to leave but our food drop was our concern for the day. The hiking was just that, hiking!  Beautiful trail and once I took meds, my legs got into a rhythm for the first time this trip.  We had an early lunch at East Branch Lean To!  Beautiful Spot right on trail. Then it was off for more miles. Moving along and occasionally chatting with SoBO's including a guy that is doing the triple crown and Started on the International Trail to the Appalachian Trail. He told us that after the next mountain we would have wonderful Trail for fifteen or more miles.  The next mountain was Little Boardman and while it was a .8 tough uphill, Recon buzzed up it and I was my usual 2-5 minutes behind.  Like the other Mountains today we were treated to Ripe Blue Berries so good straight off the plant.  Best day of all for eating these energy treats. Short break to check weather and we were headed back downhill to the road, arriving a good hour ahead of time. Nice to have a midday break, but the bugs by our ears and occasionally landing on us is driving us crazy!  Ten minutes before Three and here come Poet in the Truck.  Had everything Recon Ordered and then some.  Our Resupply lid popped open for us to grab a spur into our packs. Plus a Coke for me to guzzle!  Everything we could ever want, plus he took our trash for us!  We discussed the Ribbon Laced Katahdin from this morning and then discussed or stopping point at Coopers Brook Lean To, 3+ miles away.  Soon he was driving out of sight and we were hiking down the trail.  Such a smooth accommodation and we are set to hit Abol Bridge next! We put it on Cruise and did a little over 2.5 MPH.  Fastest we have done yet!  Hit the shelter at around 4:30 and are staying inside due to rain from 7-10. It's 6:30 and already started.  So we are set for bed and ready to Hike on in the morning!","
",Cooper Brooks Falls Lean To,"Jul 29, Sat",14.20
gbolt ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667663,"Rained Last night, so while we were happy to be in a Shelter, the moisture makes for a damp night when everything is a little soggy from previous use. Also, it is just up from Cooper River and Falls so lots of moisture in the air.  It's always a mental challenge when putting on damp clothes in the morning.  Underwear and Socks are the worst for some reason. We get through somehow and on the trail!  The Trail to and after the shelter was good enough that we called it Ventura Highway. We cruised to Mary Jo road and were there by 8:00. If Recon hadn't adjusted the Resupply, we would have been waiting there until 1-3 in the afternoon. A real blessing to keep hiking. We made stops at a shelter and then again at Antlers Campground, a popular place that never seems to match our daily hiking milage.  So we used it for a second Lunch and forgives out miles to Abol.  Recon read great reviews about a spot called Mahar Landing. Four miles away and then there was a shelter seven away.  Recon said, ""Let's check it out and if good, call it a day at 14 miles"".  The mosquitoes became relentless as we left Ventura Highway and got into a little bit more roots and mud. One Fly bit me on the back of my neck, I thought it was a yellow jacket!  Left a welt that burned whe Recon sprayed my back with Bug Spray! When we hit the peninsula campground with two water entries on a Lake side and a cove side, we were stopped for sure.  Treated it like a Nero at Recons Resort! Set up camp, best hammock hang of my life!  Recon even tried it out. Then Came laundry - clothes on a clothesline.  Hung Quilts to dry and fluff back up, so they won't be cold like last night!  Socks and shoes hit would good sanitary Sunshine and then into the lake for a bath.  Recon went under, I just couldn't do it, choosing dry hiking shorts for tonight and tomorrow!  Although my black pair dried as well.  It's really the waistbands that never seen to dry completely. After swimming, came foot repair with duck-tape.  Still having a few spots of rubbing and sores. Gathered water and had time to cook the Knorrs Mexican Rice Dinner with Pink Salmon. It takes at least 15 minutes to get the rice soft instead of the seven on the package. Even had a cup of hot apple cider to top off the evening.  I had cell service so called Joanie because tomorrow is our 41st Anniversary!  2nd Tome I have been gone on the AT!  She got a card that she won't open like I put on it!  However, home life is Ruff!  Thunderstorms brought down branches in the backyard and the bathers shower doors are out of line and bent off the wall. She told her best friend Ruthie, she was going to redo the bathrooms to teach me to ever go away again!  That's on top of an Air condition Repair last week!  Oh well, I am in such a peaceful place enjoying the time following Recons Journey to Finish Katahdin.  Speaking of which, we had two awesome views of Mama K today. Full sun, no clouds, and compared to early yesterday morning, it so much closer!  Almost like you can reach out and touch it, but still 45 miles away!  We didn't rush today and took full advantage of the camping spot. Now a sunset beyond the lake and mountain trees!  Will get the milage and to Abol Bridge in a couple of day!","
",Mahar Landing,"Jul 30, Sun",14.50
gbolt ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667714,"Woke refreshed and ready for the day.  Started ok to first Lean To, but needed Vitamin I and Tylenol to even get moving a little. Thank the Lord, Recon had a supply because mine from Shaws had already run out.  Felt good and the trail was ok to start.  But by 10 it was getting to be nothing but roots and rocks as it made its way around Lakes and ponds.  We entered and saw two boats with people fishing.  We walked North and around the corner of the pond and then Circled back to them on the other side!  The. Came the climb up  Nesuntabunt Mountain.  Hopefully the last of even the low Mountains before we Summit Katahdin. We had a partial view of Mama K with clouds covering the top twice.  Only 15 miles as a Crow Flies, but we have 30 plus left to go.  We also didn't have any Blueberry Patches either!  Then we started the trek to get at least the Lean To if not further.  Yeah - Right!  The trail became even more work. Occasional rain spit on us and twice we stopped to avoid a hard wet under an outcropping and then trees.  Nothing long and hard like we have endured previously, so can't complain. It was enough to make rocks treacherous and slow us down by the technical hiking we didn't have the past two days. We followed Rainbow Stream for ever it seemed. The Rainbow Cascades were beautiful to our right, but the hiking was demanding g full attention.  I hit my right knee on rock faces twice and so I had blood trickling down my shin. Yet, it was my left shin and knee causing the pain once the meds wore off. I thought Recon was feeling no pain and hiking like crazy until he stopped and said, ""How far is this shelter! I keep thinking it's just ahead and we just keep going and going!  I'm spent!"". His phone and died and I didn't have enough juice in my Battery to give him a charge so his was shut down.   I pulled up Far Out and it said .18 miles luckily.  Still that last little Tenth did me in totally! Decided for ease to sleep in the BatFloor lean to.  Hopefully the last 15 to Abol go smoother than today!  Just have to Keep the Faith and Keep HilN^!","
",Rainbow Stream Lean To,"Jul 31, Mon",15.20
gbolt ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667715,"Slept pretty well on the baseball bat floor of the Lean To.  Off early and used two down trees to cross the river in front of the lean to that created white noise all night.  Then it was time to finish off the HMW!  We basically followed the trail around the lake all morning, just like yesterday's hike.  We did have a cool interaction with three Loons that got as close as I have ever been to them. Recon said the same.  We stopped for water from a spring at Rainbow Springs Campground.  It was nice and Cold.  However, we were happy to be doing these miles today rather than yesterday.  Finally, after what seemed forever, we turned away from the lake and started a climb up and away from the lake.  I knew it would be the last climb to get to Baxter.  At the top is Rainbow Ledges.  The view at the sign was back the direction we came from.  We could see White Cap and then the Bigalows further beyond that.  We had lunch there, even though it was just a little after 10:00 am.  Picked some blueberries as well!  Then headed around the top and met a guy heading south called Matador. Very friendly and very talkative but enjoyable. Will they were talking, I said, ""Hey Guys, Look to your left.""  Standing in front of us was Katahdin from this side of the mountain!  Soon enough we parted ways and headed down hill. Met a guy heading SoBO that talked about leading two Princesses.  Sure enough, here came Foxy, a Flip Flopper trying to become the Oldest (67) Black Female to Thru Hike the AT.  Next came the Second Lady that was too winded to give much information. However, we gathered from the other two that Last night was her first night backpacking and sleeping in her own tent!  We took pictures of a homemade 25 To Go Sign, but I think the Calculations were off.  Doesn't matter, at some point we had 25 to Go, so we took photos anyway. It spit rain at us, like a dark cloud overhead; so we put in pack covers to make it stop and it did.  We hit Hurd Lean To, the last HMW Shelter with only 3 miles to go. A guy named Blitz asked us questions about the Baxter Kiosk sign up and the. Raced ahead to beat us there (I think).  He also mentioned two of his friends still behind us all.  We had one girl pass us this morning, but other than that, I think we are in our own little bubble. We hiked on, trying not to twist anything at this late hour.  I said a prayer about summit plans coming easy and did they ever!  We spilled out onto Golden Road and headed to the Bridge with Blitz still leading the way.  Took the picture everyone has, of the big mountain from the middle of the bridge!  Seems even bigger today than in 18'!  Then onto Abol Bridge Camp-store for Two more Breakfasts-and Lunches and one more Dinner. I made the mistake about asking prices for bunks in a cabin while Recon was paying for his Resupply.  We took there bunk prices and he paid!  Cabin number 3 is all ours this afternoon and tonight!  Typical Nero stuff, like charging in the store (everything limited and on one big generator so nothing in the cabins and no Wi-Fi. When we stepped outside, A Ranger was talking so we moved up close, while he figured out the order we came across the Bridge to the store.  We talked about Blitz being ahead of us and the couple said that was true and then us and finally them. Ranger Don (Donald Duck), said, ""Ok so he is number (points to Recon) you're 6, (points to me, you're 7, and (pointing to the couple) you two are 8 & 9"".  Just like that, we are secured at the Birches tomorrow night and Summit on Thursday!  Of course we have to sign in in the morning, take a picture and then return here to eat the breakfast that comes with the cabin. So smooth and easy, praise God!  Eat the last
Sandwiches in their freezer with a bag of chips while they said they would make more. Ate then started laundry $5 dollars to pay $2 for washing, $2 for Drying and a $1 for Detergent. Got it all done while sitting in rain gear and eating ice cream. Then it was a hot shower, totally awesome and relaxing.  Back into clean hiking clothes and a walk up the road to see about cell service. I got a bar and had to confirm Reservations with the AT Hostel on Thursday and it's done now.  Teased Joanie in a text but it barely sent so gave up.  Recon never did get service so we walked the mile back down the Road, catching one Shot of Katahdin through the road opening.  Then it drifted out of sight behind the trees to our right. Stoped in to get fresh sandwiches for dinner this time (meaning we both bought one to many dinners and breakfast) and more chips waiting for external batteries to charge.  They didn't completely charge but hopefully enough to get us through. Back in the cabin, we arranged packs, took meds, filled water bottles and prepared fro sleep and a Ten Mile hike to the Birches tomorrow! Easy Keeping the Faith because God is taking care of all the fine details so easily!","

gbolt ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667716,"Recon woke me at 5 making noise and leaving the door open with cold air coming in.  He later admitted that he thought we had to be at the Kiosk at 6:00 and only had an hour to get ready!  We didn't need to be anywhere until 7, plus he was in a good mood so I fought off the Benadryl from last night and got ready fairly quickly. When heading up the road to sign the sheet, Recon said, ""Look who it is gbolt!"".  I didn't have glasses so I had to get close and suddenly realized it was Iceman!  He is back at it supporting an FKT Hiker that left Katahdin at 4 am in the morning.  It was great to share time and later we met Maniac who had the 2nd Fastest time after Tim Horton back in the day.  His son was going run with the hiker and Iceman is providing the Road support. All pretty cool.  We went to the Kiosk and the Ranger showed at 7 and had us go through the sign in and said we were good to go for the Birches tonight!  We headed back to the Campground Store for the free Breakfast.  Turned out to be items in heat pans.  Still built a double egg and sausage muffin with side of French toast strips plus coffee and OJ.  So not bad!  Took the shortcut back to the Kiosk, chatted with the Ranger and headed into Baxter.  Almost immediately we were bombarded by Mosquitoes so aggressive and in there standing water habitat.  Bug spray work slightly but both of us were running low and kicking ourselves for not purchasing some at the Camp store.   I even resorted to the Bug net for ears and face for only the second time on the AT. Soon enough we walked along the Penobscot River and gained a little elevation for a breeze to give us some relief.  We turned away from the big river and headed through pine forest and soft trail.  The only issues came when the mountain stream was flowing down from our right side.  Slowing our pace as we still have ti be careful that we don't stubble or fall and end it a day early!  We had one stream crossing where Recon handled it easily and I of course got one foot wet.  Recon said it goes with my one eye glasses!  We followed a stream up hill to what is called Niagara Falls for Lunch. Halfway point of today and a beautiful spot.  The rest of the trail followed Darcy Pond to the left and then Grassy Pond to the right. Finally hit the Katahdin Stream Campground Sign and AT .1 to Headquarters.  Signed in, paid $10 and got Plastic Permit and Exit Slip for tomorrow. Had to gather water and walk .4 to the Birches.  Four people were setting up so we went towards the back to find a spot for a tent and hammock.  Good hang again for the last night. Recon built a fire to smoke the mosquitoes away.  Sat around the fire ring with the other nine hikers from this morning.  Relaxing afternoon getting things ready to pack for tomorrow and things to leave in the headquarters lean to for hikers. At 5 pm. the Ranger came to register the rest of the group and two more people were added.  One hiker has a boyfriend (Blue Grass) that also hiked the AT in 18'.  She also was from Brooklyn New York, about a 20 minute bike ride from my daughter.  Had a Group Pic taken , which was kind of cool and created even more community and story sharing. All ate dinner together and then laughter started growing.  The quiet guy from this morning became the Funniest comedian tonight. Him and his girlfriend told the best bear story ever.  It even became an article that Recon had actually read! Suddenly a little after 7 pm Recon joked about making coffee early in the morning to get more trail stories!  Soon everyone headed to their tents to get a good nights sleep.  All knowing that each personal story and Journey is going to come to an end at the top of a mountain, touching a sign.  I am just so thankful and blessed to be here at this moment, being allowed to share in Recons finale that has been so many years in the making.  It is truly filling a gap in my already great Appalachian Trail Thru Hike Experience.","
",The Birches,"Aug 02, Wed",9.80
gbolt ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667717,"Last night in the Hammock I slept well.  Can't say the same for Recon!  Possible Mouse issues over an exploded bag of Potato Chips!  Did t really matter, we both were, ""Ready to Climb!"".  Dropped our unnecessary pack items in the Small Thru hikers lean to, but on our much lighter packs, got water and grabbed our poles. In my case, just one pole. I knew what to expect today!  It starts out uphill but easy.  Soon you hit more root and rock. The noise of Katahdin Falls starts to build and soon you cross a bridge over the stream that marks the end of a pleasant walk.  You climb up to the upper falls and the climb never stops. It is like NH and the beginning of Maine with stepping from stone to roots to grabbing trees rub smoothed by som many hand pulls. The noise of the falls quickly fades as you keeping climbing up through the narrow space between trees that get smaller as you climb higher.  A few long strides on granite rock and then back into a narrow path with only 6 foot trees, then four and suddenly you step up above tree-line and see the bouldering ahead.  It is best to follow the white blaze as it is usually the safest path chosen.  Even with that, you hit a steel hand spike that becomes a foot spike along with bolt to use anyway your body sees fit or needs to.  You breath a second until you come to the next metal rung that is again used by multiple body parts to get leverage up and to the next set of boulders. Finally you see the summit and slide over it to get to a standing position and maybe 50 yards before the second set of boulders blocks your view of the next false summit.  It was at this point Recon had signal and called Kathy after days without be able to check in. My Verizon wasn't as good , plus I needed to keep moving because Recons pace is so much faster than mine.  So I gave Recon some Privacy and continued to work laterally, up, over around and back laterally the opposite direction to keep gaining altitude.  Finally after hours, not minutes, you reach your next false summit.  But this time you are on the tablelands and can look up and see the top and barely make out a sign post over a mile away.  The pay off is that all along the way you keep getting better and better views. This time looking back from Katahdin in the direction already travelled versus the days spent looking for Katahdin.  Your mind is filled with so many personal and private thoughts, you fight to make sense and order from your brain, and you continue to climb at a more controllable rate. Suddenly, the sign is there as if the rocks are parting for you. I started videoing as Recon took his long awaited final steps and touched the sign!  I was overjoyed for him!  To overcome so many obstacles and stay committed to this completion. It was an honor to take summit photos.  It is such a personal journey that cannot be put into words!  Next came the chance to hand our phones off to other hikers and get both us both touching the sign!  Having travelled so many miles and the attempts shared to complete this journey, it was moving to be in this moment.  Recon then let me climb the sign and took some summit pics of myself as well!  It is so cool for me to be doing this a second time and on the 5th Anniversary of our 2018 Hike.  Soon we gave way to Jeff and Miya, as well as Blitz to have there time at the sign.  Fortunately, we ended it all with a group pic for the Birches last night and Summit today before slowly giving way to other hikers. We had a celebratory Snickers that Recon carted up, that we devoured while Recon messaged all of his family that had supported him through the thick and thin of things.  Soon enough we needed to retrace our steps back down the mountain to catch a shuttle out of BSP.  The journey down isn't much easier than the journey up.  One time I was following another hiker and Recon stated that we had lost the white blazes.  That hiker continues on while we backtracked and moved laterally. Before following blazes back down.  Recon played Marco / Polo or actually called out ""gbolt"" to get me headed back down in The correct direction. We prayed that the hiker made it out as well because we never saw him again. Recon twice saved me from having to pull out my Xbox bag and filter water by just grabbing my bottle and filling it with his.  I needed to stay hydrated and keep the Vitamin I flowing.  My knees, both now, were aching!  But prayers were answered.  Neither of us got stretchered out and the weather was picture perfect!  They are back calling for rain for the next three days!  Matter of fact, while finishing the last mile and then organizing packs while waiting on a shuttle, it constantly sprinkled raindrops here and there.  Yet, we never got caught in it. Either sitting in the shuttle or restaurant later!  God is Good!  Prayers are Answered. So tired and ready to sleep that I will have to gather my thoughts post summit day.","

gbolt ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667718,"Woke a little later -5:30 am. and immediately knew I had no more miles left in my bodies Tank.  Very sore and slow moving.  Sipped on Coffee and watched the rain fall, so happy to be indoors and not in the elements!  Recon rain to McD's and picked me up an Ice Tea!  I took Advil and Tylenol to try and get my aching under control.  Recon found the Bear Article in the Trek so I was able to see the polished story from two nights ago.  Very well written and interesting.  Soon we were packed up and had our stuff thrown into the back of the car and were on our way.  Rather than go the way we came on the interstate, Recon is cutting back through Maine on the same path that we shuttled to start our adventure.  It is nice not to be going slower than the chaos of a freeway.  My mind is free to wander and reflect. Definitely feeling Blessed to have had great weather, safe hiking despite the rigors of the section and the past wear and tear on the body, as well as being a part of Recon's Journey. I truly appreciated the beauty of the trail and enjoyed the views, flowing streams and being enveloped by the Woods more than any other time.  While I still hated the Uphills, I did enjoy the pace of life on the trail.  It is very freeing and allows a peace and calm to bath the body and the soul.  I really enjoyed knowing what to expect and what laid ahead both going up and coming down Katahdin.  It was like visiting a distant, yet familiar friend.  As for the sign, it is still a place of Honor and Reverence. It was thrilling to Video Tape Recon's walk up and the ultimate touching of the sign.  That's special in so many ways that words can't explain.  The actual climbing on the sign for the typical Summit pic is actually anticlimactic and the moment has passed. However, it was very special for me to walk up and touch the sign while fist bumping Recon!  A shared Journey and Experience that has come full circle since a chance meeting all those miles and months ago on Mt Albert at the 100 mile mark of the AT.  Recon was always the strongest hiker I knew and had a gear that could easily leave me in his dust.  Yet, he always backed off and allowed me to catch up and usually with a sly grin and a one liner that would get me laughing inspire of the discomfort I was in at the moment.  His tenacity and ability to stay committed and overcome so many obstacles put in his way is truly inspiring. He truly Reconned the best outcome of all.  It was very special for me to be able to climb up on the sign on the Fifth Year Anniversary of my Hike. I feel totally fulfilled, without any void or uncertainty. The Trail (and God) provide. In this case, a chance to reset the speed of life. Our world and new technologies are wonderful; but it can bombard our mind and soul. Surrounding us with such commotion that are senses become dulled and we are just washed down the stream into rapids and shallows not of our choosing.  I am grateful that once again, I will get to choose my speed of life, taking with me the idea that it truly is the smiles not the miles.  It's the people brought together by the common thread of humanity that we all share.  Finally, there is no place like Home, wherever that may be.  I can truly relax and know that as long as I Keep the Faith and Keep Living,  it is well with my Soul.  Thank you Recon for allowing me this ending to the Appalachian Trail Thru Hike.",,View Entry,"Aug 04, Fri",0
