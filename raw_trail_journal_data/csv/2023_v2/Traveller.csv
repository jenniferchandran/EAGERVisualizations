Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666412,"Because I thrive on a plant-based diet, it takes a little more planning to get the right foods and the right quantities to keep me going. Experience tells me that if I stay on the trail long enough I will lose weight no matter how hard I try to keep the daily calories up. It's always a question of balancing the volume of food you carry against the weight on your back. But the food planning is done and I know I'll eat well on the trail. I just finished reading a great book by Colin O'Brady entitled ""The Impossible First"". Here was a young man who planned and accomplished an unsupported and unassisted walk across Antarctica via the South Pole. The minor planning effort for this last leg of my AT adventures is absurdly simple by comparison. So much has changed about the AT since it was first conceived and laid out to make it easy and accessible. We should never underestimate the difficulties we might encounter with any endeavor, but my personal challenge has always been to overcome those fears and start moving.",,View Entry,"Jul 04, Tue",0

The good news is always that the rain will stop...eventually. The facts of life on long-distance hiking adventures are that you have to accept whatever weather shows up. My start is still on track for tomorrow as long as we can get to the trailhead. I suspect there won't be any shortage of water on the trail through Vermont for drinking; another silver lining in the clouds I see right now.",,View Entry,"Jul 10, Mon",0
Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666768,joani and I have had to do some serious travel planning on the fly due to the torrential rains the last few days. But the skies cleared this morning and we drove at Kelley Stand Road. This gravel road through the heart of the Green Mountain National Forest survived the rains very well. There were a few minor washout but we made it to the trailhead and Joani sent me off as she has done a few times now. I am having difficulty uploading photos from my phone but as soon as I can I'll catch up. My first day back on the trail was very tough. I had gotten away from my hike-training and I could tell. Each year we age it gets harder to do the things we took for granted. But I planned to start out slow this week and so I got to my first nights destination. I wound up sleeping in the shelter instead of tenting. I had what is advertised as Vermonts largest AT shelter all to myself. The other irony of the day was that our gravel forest road got us to the trailhead while the hard-road access was closed due to flooding. It's been tough for our intrepid Vermonters.,"Kelley Stand Road Trailhead

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666769,"Another beautiful day of hiking that contrasted with the muddy, wet, waterlogged trail and woods. Since starting out yesterday I've just accepted completely soaked shoes and socks. As soon as you wash them off in a clear stream or gravelly section of trail that has water running in it, the next bend is a deep, muddy quagmire. I know Vermont is notorious for its mud season in the spring but these rains have made a soupy mess of the trail. Just keep on slogging through it. The little log cabin that is tonight's shelter is a welcome stop. The neighborhood chipmunk is not happy with my presence at the picnic table.","Stratton Pond Shelter

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666793,"There is something slightly off when you see a ski area in the summer. Bromley was no exception and since it doesn't operate any summer activity at the summit that I could see, it was strangely out of place. But thank you Bromley Ski Resort! You open your ski patrol Hut to AT and Long Trail hikers. There's no water so I had to carry the extra weight up from down the mountain, but having a shelter for tonight when rain is in the forecast makes it worth it. The hut isn't exactly set up for overnighter like me but it will do. They have entrusted hikers and backpackers by leaving it unlocked. No vandalism, it was clean when I got here but I swept it out anyway. There is even a privy nearby. I only hope hikers continue to respect this gift so it can continue to be used.","Spruce Peak Cabin

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667023,"After the wild night of weather on Bromley Summit, the dawn broke peacefully but still ominous. It was a cloudy, muggy hike to what turned out to be a nice, large shelter. Further evidence of the damage caused by the week of rain was the footbridge right in front of the shelter, which was tilted precariously, and officially ""closed"". But the Vermont structures are so solid hikers crossed the little bridge anyway, avoiding a bushwhack alternate trail to continue our way north.","Bromley Warming Hut

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667024,"A sunny day in the dark, dense woods of Vermont can have a tremendous effect on your morale and mood. After gloom and wetness just the hint that things could possibly, maybe, dry out a bit makes for an upbeat day. But arriving at Greenwall Shelter and checking the weather, it looked like rain would return overnight so I opted not to set up my tent. Like all weather guesses, I was wrong and would have had plenty of time the next morning to pack up dry. But the shelter was reasonably quiet with just two other hikers and few mosquitoes so I didn't mind foregoing my little tent cocoon.","Peru Peak Shelter

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667037,"each day you calculate what the weather, your body and your mental state will allow you to do. The weather report from my Garmin InReach unit indicated rain this morning and light rain throughout the day. So knowing the goal for the day was only about 9 or 10 miles, I took my time leaving Greenwall Shelter. It paid off because once the morning rain let up and I got on the trail, the rest of the day was rain free. It was a muggy, overcast day of walking but I was still able to take in the sights and take my time getting to Clarenden. Once there I enjoyed a cold stream for washing up, the company of a nice young hiker, and a flat, grassy spot to set up my tent. Why my tent instead of the shelter? The promise of a rain-free night and a respite from the mosquitoes ( which have been surprisingly few...but still annoying.","Greenwall Shelter

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667038,"The long climb to reach Killington Peak was something of dread because I have been really feeling the fatigue of a first week's effort. The legs and back were feeling stronger but the heart and lungs are still feeling their age. It takes me probably twice as long to ascend a couple thousand feet as the normal, younger through-hiker. This is made worse by the punishing design of this older part of America's eastern foot trail; straight up and straight down, then repeat. Fortunately the trail leading up to Killington was a bit more gradually but it was a tiring day for me nonetheless. It never really presented any views other than the ""long green tunnel"", which doesn't improve morale. But I made it to the shelter near Killington Summit. An old stone cabin so decrepit and leaky it literally dared you to spend a night inside. I didnt. There was just enough room for my tent nearby. A 0.2 mile scramble up a VERY steep and rocky trail to the open summit offered a sunset view but more smoke from Canada made for an underwhelming visit to the top. I still enjoyed the evening with 3 other tenters and slept well through the cool, breezy night at elevation with the Spruce and fir trees adding a freshness to the air.","Clarenden Shelter

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667039,"Nothing spurs you to action like an anticipated meetup with your loved one. Yes, the hot shower and comfortable bed, and the cold drink and hot meal are big motivators but it was so nice to see Joani's smiling face and supportive presence. It made a long and tiring day of hiking all worth it. I don't think I have ever gone 8 days without a town-stop, hostel or break in the action until this starting stretch of my 5th AT section hike. I was clearly fatigued and absolutely OUT of gas (food)! What a welcome sight to walk out of the woods around Kent Pond and see the grassy meadow leading up to the Inn.

We are taking our time Checking out this morning and enjoying afew hours together before I head out for a short mileage day to tonight's camp spot. Everything about Killington has been relaxed but a bit quirky. It is oddly inactive, I guess because the village is built around winter skiing. We still enjoyed some good meals and even some live entertainment at Mary-Lou's on a Tuesday night. I'm resupplied, cleaned up, rested and hopefully ready for some big days ahead that will challenge these old lungs and heart. So it's on to New Hampshire.A footnote, after writing this entry I ended up taking advantage of a good weather day to walk extra miles.

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667169,"Today I woke up to rain, which let up some before I left the shelter. But it was a drizzly, damp day throughout the hike. This part of Vermont varied a little bit with the trail winding through valley farmlands and vast meadows that would be the envy of every butterfly gardener. Of course, there were no butterflies out on this day. I crossed several roads that showed the evidence of the big floods. Washed out footbridges and trailhead parking area filled with mud and debris. Even with the farmlands, there were multiple wooded hills that the trail went up and down, a long, tiring rollercoaster. I made it to a very nice shelter fronted by open woods, but the heavy thunderstorms were closing in just as I got settled into the shelter. It poured well into midnight. Today the sun broke out, the virds are happy and I am about to step out. It looks to be a good day.","Winturri Shelter

The storms passed sometime in the night, and the sun broke through the trees and into our faces, which promised a good day ahead. And it was. The trails were still soggy and wet with the new accumulation of rain (clearly the ground is well saturated in Vermont by now). But I had made the call to make it an easy day and pull up after about 9 miles at Happy Hill Shelter. Probably because it was only 7 miles from Hanover going north, the shelter site was empty and I had my choice of tent sites. One other late stragglers stayed in the shelter, arriving after I had turned into my tent. The nearby creek was loud enough to provide just the right volume of white noise for sleeping.

This is the home of Dartmouth University. It was a planned and yet serendipitous stopover. Thanks to the generous help of Bill Young, one of Hanover's Trail Angel's, I was able to get some groceries and essentials, have a couple slices of pizza, and get a ride out of town to the old-style Sunset Inn Motel. The laundry is getting done! The shower was awesome! The air conditioner is drying out most of my soggy gear! The Hanover free bus system will whisk me back to town and the trail in the morning!

That's how I felt about Hanover, NH as I was riding their free bus from the motel ba k to town at 6:30am to get back on the trail. It was a long day of hiking but a beautiful, sunny day and the woods were brighter and full of birdsong. I spooked a porcupine that scrambled up a tree with its posterior all a-quiver. Insurance that I would make no attempt to pursue it! Reaching Trapper John's Shelter, a passing thunderstorm briefly interrupted the camp routine. But this storm passed quickly, so I set up my little tent for a night's rest without being troubled with the occasional mosquito.

There is an old fire tower and fire wardens cabin at the summit that made a great mid-day stop and offered some panoramic views from the tower. Hexacuba shelter was, indeed a hexagonal design structure with a central supporting post and two sides for the opening. The privy was called the Penta-Privy but it didn't seem to have any geometrical connection to the name. The mosquitoes have become more troublesome so I set up my tent in front of the hexagon on a little narrow shelf of flat ground and slept comfortably.

The big climb up to Mooselauke however wasn't nearly as tough a climb as I feared. And the reward was a first look at Alpine habitats above treeline. A bit of a shock at the summit though because 3 or 4 trails come together there and the sunny skies at the top brought out lots of people. Unfortunately the hike down the other side of the mountain was unexpectedly steep and damp. About a mile out, the rains commenced and when I got to the shelter it was almost full.

There is no electricity or hot water but plenty of drinking water, very clean composting toilet systems and wash sinks. The highlight of course was a massive dinner served family style, and a similar huge breakfast the next morning. They are warm, cozy places in the forest with friendly and energetic staff.

It was open and exposed walking so I ducked under a large Boulder until the thunder gradually moved off.

A clear morning! A wonderful hike through an alpine zone loaded with delicate looking groundcover plants and flowers. And then, the summit just as quickly disappeared in a cloud. It only added to the special feeling of being in a unique and forbidding place. At the summit was the usual hustle and bustle of tourists, cog train arrivals and departures and scores of day hikers with their packs and poles. The State of New Hampshire manages the mountain park and thoughtfully provides a backpacker lounge in the basement. It was quiet and clean and a break from all the commotion upstairs. I enjoyed the real bathroom with hot water at the sinks, and ate some high calorie snacks from the Cafe above. In fact I lingered at the summit facilities for almost 2 hours. Even though I had miles to go before reaching Madison Hut, it was just too much fun hanging out. Even after I headed down the path away from the top, the first mile or so heading back down from Washington was a happy parade of fellow hikers and chugging cog trains going up the mountain. Everywhere you looked were deep ravines and Gulfs. More presidential peaks loomed ahead, ducking in and out of the clouds. The sky was blue and the sun was warm. Windy? Very. There was a steady 20-25 mph wind blowing, enough to keep me a bit off balance in the Alpine rocky paths. The rest of the day was an exhilarating traverse of Mts. Clay, Jefferson, Adams and maybe one or two others I can't name right now. The day ended almost as dramatically with a steep downhill hike into Madison Spring Hut at the foot of Mt. Madison.

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667907,"When your morning starts with a very steep, rocky climb over a big mountain, it can either set you up for a great day once the hard stuff is out of the way...or it tuckers you out with miles more to go. I found the early morning climb to the Summit of Mt. Madison steep but less difficult than I feared. I've started experimenting with making the steep climbs over rocks without using my trekking poles. It seemed counter intuitive since my balance on the uneven trails has been precarious. But by freeing up both my hands, it was actually more secure to take handholds at boulders and low-growing conifers along the trail. I realized how I used to clamber over obstacles when I was 10 years old and it was a good feeling. It also lowered my center of gravity...essential to avoid falling backwards with 25 pounds strapped to my back. A fellow hiker snapped a photo of me at the top, and then I quickly saw that the hardest part of the day would be the very steep and rocky descent towards Pinkham Notch. I still kept the trekking poles packed away which also seemed better for securing handholds and focusing on placing my feet where they needed to be. Eventually the trail gets a little less steep as it approaches the ""Notch"". Notches, gaps or passes...they all mean the same thing; usually a steep drop down followed by an equally steep climb back up to surrounding mountains and ridges. At Pinkham Notch however I knew I had a bed, a hot shower and some good food waiting for me.","Madison Hut

It was a walk through a storm at cloud level. Later I heard that extremely high winds were forcing hikers off the higher elevations of the Presidentials.

The Barn is no different and made for a comfortable stay with an extra day to rest and resupply.

I also got to try out the wooden tent platforms using cup holder screws instead of tent stakes. Someone at the last hostel stop suggested them, and they worked like a charm.

It's basically a mile long ravine with steep rocky Cliffs on both sides. Over time, thousands of large and small boulders, many the size of cars or larger, tumbled down into the ravine where they make for a difficult but fun maze that the trail snakes through. Right after that is completed you have to make a long, steep climb up Mahoosuc Arm. It took me 8 hours to go this 5+ miles. I got through the notch accompanied by 2 fellow hikers and we all helped each other up, down and through the maze. The encouragement of friends was a big help.

We helped each other through Mahoosuc Notch and strategized together to get into Rangeley and avoid some coming weather. After sharing a cabin in Rangeley it became obvious that Smoke had a painful knee and he decided to get off the trail and get it checked out. In my several section hikes of the AT, I've encountered lots of times and places where injury has unhappily ended someone's adventure. The foremost in my mind was the flip flop hike Joani and attempted in 2015. It was a very sad, disappointing day when her knee grew so painful we had no choice but to abandon our dream. I am fortunate so far and grateful to be able to continue hiking. Just a bit more and I can be at Katahdin. Watching every step, taking as long as it takes, listening to what this old body is telling me. So this day I made a very long walk to get back on my schedule. It turned out to be the right day to make up some miles because the trail was kind. Lots of level ground or gentle grades, minimal mud, and great weather. It was a day of seeing the first of Maine's big ponds and hearing the eerie call of loons. Ending the long day at a nice campsite before rains returned overnight was the nightcap I needed.","Rangeley

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668290,"Another rainfree day but one that started out wet and overcast after raining all night. Winding my way up a rocky but ""reasonable"" trail today. Western Maine has a number of ski resorts I Remer hearing about back in my college days and the early days of our marriage. Joani had skied in Maine and Vermont when she was in high school. When we met she still had a nice set of skis, and it all seemed exotic to a south Florida boy like me. We were pretty poor during our first few years of married life in Maine, so hitting the slopes was really out of the question. She sold her ski equipment and we satisfied ourselves with road trips around Maine. Places like Saddleback and Sugarloaf resorts were passing spots on a road map. Today I hiked that reasonable trail up and over Saddleback Mountain. Only I never saw the actual ski area. It was on the other side of the hill. Not that I would have seen it anyway...another morning in the high alpine zone amongst the heavy clouds. But some mountains are a series of greater and lesser Peaks along a Ridgeline. Such was Saddleback. It made for a windy, exposed and wet walk among the blueberries and the dainty little alpine plants. And then the cloud level lifted, the sun came out and as I reached Saddleback Junior it was dry, sunny, cool and windy. Among the difficult days of hiking, even a few moments in the lap of raw beauty makes this trip worth it. And I got dry out my tent! Thank you Legs and Double H for encouraging me to join them at the summit for a gear drying festival. I could sit and soak in the scenery as all that water weight disappeared with the alpine wind.","Piazza Rock Shelter

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668292,"in order to get back to my original schedule laid out for this trip (after the early stop in Rangeley), I needed to hike another long day. Get an early start.. And keep moving. Hope for good weather and easier trails weather. It all worked. It wasn't a particularly memorable day in the woods but that was no fault of the woods; more an issue of walking with mental blinders on. I feel sorry for hikers who are compelled or forced to hike long miles every day. You miss a lot. Getting older has that advantage at least. Hiking lower miles allows you to see the multitude of mushrooms in their bizarre shapes and colors. You wonder if the bluebeads on the Clintonias can possibly get any bluer. You hear the birds of the  northern conifers that sing strange new songs. So today I confess I did miss all that. But I slid down into the Carrabasset Valley, heard the water rushing down to meet the South Branch of the Carrabasset River, forded the river that was, weeks earlier, impassable to hikers,, and eased into my night's campsite.

Another beautiful day and I was happy to behold the morning sun come over the mountains in that classic golden glow. Great views on South Crocker, then another sharp drop and climb to North Peak. The AT will always find a way to go straight up, then down, every mountain within reach. Got to my pickup and was astounded by the upscale hostel.

One starts to get a real sense of the remoteness of Maine, especially when viewed from atop Avery Peak. The vast area below of Flagstaff Lake with almost no developed shoreline seemed peaceful and inviting. Other lakes begin to appear to the north and east, foreshadowing Maine's long history of canoe passages and portages.

Traveller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668423,"Getting into the Safford Notch Campsite was interesting for its maze-like trail through giant boulders and narrow passages between house-sized rocks. The site itself was spread out and pooy marked but I had found a level spot for the tent. Rain was forecast to return this night after a marvelously clear day over the Bigelows. And it did rain, all night long. What can you do. In the morning I listened for a letup, then hustled everything that was dry into my backpack. I rolled up my sopping wet tent, hitched it to the outside of the pack and started walking. It was also colder than usual so walking was the best way to warm up and put the rain out of my head. The goal today is to finish hiking over Little Bigelow Mountain and find room at the next shelter location, for rain was forecast to continue well into that next night. Not heavy downpours, but enough drizzly cold rain to take the fun out of anything related to walking through the woods and over exposed, rocky, alpine ridges. And climbing Little Bigelow meant reaching an elevation where the general malaise of a gloomy day turned windy, and intensely threatening. The trees as you approach the higher alpine ridges are stunted and misshapen. When you hike through rain clouds in 25 to 35 mph winds and stinging rain, it's easy to see how the trees have been beaten down. Krumholtz. That's the term applied to these dwarf forests. On a nice day, they are strange and interesting but on a day like today they offer no shelter, and the occasional outcrops of bare rock are downright scary.","Safford Notch Campsite

Today's path followed the historic Great Carry Path between West and East Carry Ponds. A sign along the trail explains the portage route and its use by Benedict Arnold and his troops as they tried to take Quebec City during the American Revolution. No doubt it was already an established route used by native Americans, French trappers and early colonial explorers. I couldn't imagine dragging canoes and bateaux through this muddy corridor but it might have been a much better path back then. It was even more difficult to imagine a thousand of his troops working their way through these woods with all their supplies and tents. The ponds themselves are all clean and clear. The chain of lakes and ponds in this remote part of Maine are a reminder of a glacial epoch that left an indelible mark on the Landscape. The surprise ending to this wonderful day was arriving at Harrison's Pierce Pond Fish Camp. My new hiking partner Zip and I split a cabin there and enjoyed the hospitality of owner Tim and his group of neighbor friends for dinner. The lodge and Cabins are a throwback to the early 1900's. Indeed Tim said the lodge was well over 100 years old (and it looked it). But what a great stay in the deep heart of Maine next to the noisy Pierce Pond Stream among the cedars, white pines, and a host of coniferous and deciduous species.

Crossing the long, flat tablelands it crosses your mind that this is not the place to be in a thunderstorm. And then I heard thunder rumbling off in the distance.should I go on? Only 2 miles of exposed ridgetop and I will be at Baxter Peak. By the time I got to Thoreau Spring where another trail leads back down to treeline, there was no more thunder. Just biting rain and some sleet and steady 35mph wind. So on I went. Honestly, being so wet and now cold, I just wanted to be done. Several hikers coming back down from the summit urged me to keep going, which really bolstered my spirits. So on I trudged and then, suddenly the rain let up, the sky lightened a bit and I was at the summit. Alone. Nobody but me.
