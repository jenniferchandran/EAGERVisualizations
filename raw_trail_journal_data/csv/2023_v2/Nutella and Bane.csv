Back in 2015 we enjoyed every single step on this trail and befriended so much lovely people we HOPE to meet again this year.
We were helped, fed and last but not least saved by people we consider friends since then.
Guys... if you read this... we look forward to see you again :-) <3",,View Entry,"Jan 10, Tue",0

Nutella and Bane,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659917,"Today is question time. We get A LOT of questions online but of course also in real life from former co-workers, managers, friends and family. Iâ€˜ll gather a few and the most asked ones here in no particular order except the first one.


Q 1 : How do you guys afford a 3 year long hiking trip doing 5 thru hikes on 3 different continents?


A 1 : Well, the answer is easier than I initially thought. Both of us worked full time for multiple years, earning different but always good amounts of money AND fixated an amount weâ€˜d both save together monthly. So just for example, imagine you save 50-100â‚¬ a month, at the end of the year you gonna have either 700 or 1400â‚¬ in the bank (Austrians get 14 paychecks a year). So whatever your goals in life are, set yourself a amount you can afford to save monthly and stick with it. We did multiple trips throughout the years and nonetheless we were always able to save up.


Q 2 : How did you guys choose your gear ?


A 2 : Itâ€™s a combination of try&error and research. With so many years of hiking and miles under your belt you know exactly what u like and what u donâ€™t. You know exactly what u need and what u donâ€™t. BUT our gear is still changing all the time. We had a lot of different boots, backpacks and other stuff. What we can guarantee after all these years,â€¦ the most expensive isnâ€™t always the best, but the cheapest isnâ€™t very good most of the time.


Q 3 : How does it work out to hike 22.000km as a couple ?


A 3 : From all of our hikes we know that there a good days and bad days. Itâ€™s crazy to think that a couple will never argue or disagree while thru hiking together. In my (Bane) opinion there are 2 key factors.Â 


First, give each other room to breath. Nobody needs or wants to talk all the time and nobody likes or is fascinated by the same things. Hike or own Hike, but hike it as a loving couple, together.


Second, respect each other even on bad days. Sometimes you will disagree or argue, but itâ€™s important to see behind all this fuss that you deeply love the person next to you.


Please let us know if you want to know anything else :)

Nutella and Bane,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660064,"Everything is on its way now.
Nutella and I are arriving in Atlanta on the 18th of February, which means our Start Date on the Trail will be the 20th of February.
In contrast to our ThruHike in 2015 we want to have a few days to do ""arrive"" properly, do our shopping (Gas, Food and Co.) and do the Approach Trail.
Our gear is set, the packs are packed and we are more than thrilled our 3 years journey is finally starting.
Looking forward to all of you guys out there",,View Entry,"Feb 05, Sun",0
Nutella and Bane,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660196,"Arriving in the States


We had our flight early in the morning going from Salzburg to Frankfurt and it was a 55 minute breeze. Super easy flight.


From Frankfurt to Atlanta was also a great flight BUT 2 things were nervewrecking.


Some a**ho*e was smoking in the restrooms. I meanâ€¦ how stupid can someone be ? Thousands of feet above the Atlantic Ocean and Someone is smoking ? I canâ€™t unterstand thatQuite a few babies keeping me awake with their crying. But alright, I got to watch quite some movies because of thatÂ ðŸ˜…


Arriving In the US and experience with Customs and Border Security was great. Super understanding and supporting us the best way they could. Thank you Neill, Alberta and 3rd guy. Super sorry I didnâ€™t catch your name. We got a longer visa than we probably will need because the guys understood the nature of long distance hiking and itâ€™s Chance of taking longer than expected.


We had a taxi bringing us to our hotel, awesome Mexican dinner (our time would have been 1am, but who cares) and felt into a food coma afterwards.


Today is shopping day to get the goods and supplies we werenâ€™t allowed to bring into the US before we get picked up tomorrow morning by our shuttle driver Claudia.
See everyone out there. Enjoy your Hikes.
We will

Nutella and Bane,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660259,"And so, weâ€˜ve made our first 5 days on the Trail and hit Neels Gap early in the day today.
Day 1 : Approach Trail.
Â Itâ€™s not even close to be so hard as a lot of people say. I (Bane) enjoyed it, Nutella didnâ€™t like the stairs up the falls but the rest was fine.
Day 2 : Springer to Hawk
Easy hike in awesome weather. We are getting used to carry a pack again made quite some new friends along the trail early.
Day 3 : Hawk to Gooch
Nice attack on Nutellaâ€™s Sleeping Bag but not too bad. The hike itself was nice and not too hard.
Day 4 : Gooch to Slaughter Creek
We had planned to stay at Lance but started early in the morning because of the weather report. So we arrived at Lance Creek at around 1pm and decided to push on, closer to Blood Mountain. The hike wasnâ€™t too bad but the campsite was wet and muddy. So we need to clean and dry our stuff tomorrow.
Day 5: Slaughter to Neels Gap / Cabins
We conquered Blood Mountain in the morning with awesome weather and views as a reward. Devoured pizza at Neels, resupplied and right now clean and dry our stuff.
We will attend the Kick off tomorrow at Neels and hike on from there. Until next time,

Nutella and Bane,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660321,"We made quiet some progress in the last days with both of us doing exceptionally well. The Ups are still slowing us down significantly but we are getting better and better.
The â€žView Godsâ€œ werenâ€™t so kind to us the past 3 days but we enjoy it nonetheless.
We can recommend the Cheese Factory Site for camping.
The next time we will be writing here probably will be at Franklin, NC.
Yes, we are close to be finished with Georgia and go on into State number 2, North Carolina.","Neels Gap

Nutella and Bane,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660583,"I apologise for being super lazy writing a journal but we were busy hiking ðŸ¥¾.
Quite something happened since Dicks Creek Gap and Iâ€™ll try to give some insight.
We did close to 100Â miles since then and we are now at Fontana Dam right before entering the smokies.
In Franklin we hitched down before the big storm hit and had decent Mexican lunch and a visit to Outdoor 76 (we replaced our Hang Bag with a Bear canister and are still getting used to it).
We climbed down and up to the NOC (not without a nice little stay at a hostel with a hot tub) and did decent miles day after day.
Itâ€™s amazing to know we already did 166,3 miles without any bigger problems and we really look forward to the smokies. Even tho the weather isnâ€™t looking super amazing I am sure we will have a nice 7-8 day time up there.
Thank you all for following along and greetings to every lovely person we already met and befriended while doing this.

Nutella and Bane,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661258,"We went up into the Smokies in beautiful sunshine but everything afterwards was just ridiculous.
We had rain, snow, freezing fog, a trail turnt into a ice slide, forced Zero Days in Gatlinburg because the temps were below freezingâ€¦ it was crazy.Â 
Nonetheless we did it, made it out of the Smokies a few days ago and the weather changed, also because of the lower elevation.
We did our first 17.1 mile the yesterday and arrived in Hot Springs today.
We will have a Nearo today, eat Town Food, do laundry and hike on tomorrow.
275 miles downÂ

We love the mountains, the trail, the woods, the people.
We had awesome trail magic multiple time and the Virginia Triple Crown was outstanding.
Some hikers around us did quit and we do miss them a lot, others are still here and we love to have em around us.
Itâ€™s another 130 to the Shenandoahs and we look so much forward to itâ€¦. But everyday on the AT is great, fun and awesome.

Nutella and Bane,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667713,"Hello Followers, friends and family.
Iâ€™m terrible sorry for not posting here in such a long time. We are 2 days short of going Into New Hampshire and enjoyed everything south from here so much.
A lot has happened and this text could be a mile long with all the stories.
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and now Vermont for 2 more days. We are sitting at 465 miles left to Katahdin.
We enjoyed Mt. Stratton, Mt. Greylock, awesome Ponds, nice citys and so many loving people.
We had our fair share of bad weather and are back on our coldweather gear (sleeping bags and clothes) which makes the backpack a little heavier but the nights more comfy.
Again, terribly sorry for not posting in a long time, itâ€™s just so much more convenient to post on Instagram (@hikerwin) or in the Thru Hiker Groups on Facebook.
I try to do better.
thank you to everyone following and also every kind soul who we met along the trail so far.","Port Clinton
