It promises to be a beautiful start to a long anticipated adventure   I will miss my beautiful wife and my family","Harper's Ferry

Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662410,had a grand start to my adventure   It was a beautiful day warm but not hot. Theresa Peggy and Tim were with me. Tim and I have jointly agreed to take the first week easy. We plan to average 12ish. That leave a lot of time at camp but this is a marathon so we will start slow and see what we can do later. Looking forward to a hot shower at my sister Claire’s on day 7. It was great to start this hike with my wife   She has shown me that we can do more than we think we are able   As Nike says just go out and do it  I am looking forward to her joint us again   Maybe at Katahdin or again at Harper’s Ferry for the southern leg,"Harper’s Ferry

Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662477,Another beautiful warm day. It’s great to be out in the spring sunshine. Had breakfast with my friend Tom. He is working south. Our plan was to stop at Pine Knob shelter but after looking at the rain we decided we wanted to be at Ravens Rock as early as we could on Saturday as the rain is due at 2  Stopped at the original Washington Monument  it was built 60 yrs before that other one   Was running a little low on water when lo and behold an Angel appeared.  Pick (Pick of the Litter) was out dispensing Gatorade  this was a great pick me up and got me though the extra mile and a half,"Crampton Gap
",Annapolis Rocks,"Apr 21, Fri",14.10
Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662513,"The goal today - avoid the rain.  Ravens Rock is 11.9 miles away and we have been managing 2/hr including stops  We are concerned that it will fill up before or arrival so we got an early start
I left Tim at about mile 2. It was a tough day as it had three climbs the hardest at at end. Started spitting when I was .2 out  Tim arrived about 20 minutes later  
ten minutes later the rain came  
the only mishap being that I cracked the screen of the Kindle that Ian let me use  I was looking forward to a couple of hours of reading. Guess I’ll just have to nap","Annapolis Rocks
",Raven Rock,"Apr 22, Sat",11.90
Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662634,"The run in to Raven Rock was hard.  We were pushing the speed and there was a final steep long climb up to the shelter.  I was worried that the trail was going to wear me down after that day. Fortunately today was easier, the weather was cooler and I felt good. 
Completed our first state when we crossed the Mason Dixon line into PA. One state done 13 to go.
 Tim and I leapfrogged the day and arrived at the shelter mid afternoon.  We decided to stay in the shelter as it was promised to be a cold night. Had my first equipment failure today. One of the extra tough bags Tim and I use to collect water had a leak. Not to worry as I carry a spare","Raven Rock
",Tumbling Run Shelter,"Apr 23, Sun",13.20
Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662637,"I guess the best place to start is while asleep, or while trying to sleep.  Went to bed around 6 just to get out of the cold.  You basically endure the night when you are not warm. We normally get up at 6 and do breakfast and break camp and get on the trail by 7:30-8. At five am I formulated a new plan. Get up skip breakfast and get hiking to warm up.  At six I crawled out of the warmth and put on my cold hiking clothes and two extra shirts and my winter coat and my rain gear.  Nope still cold. 
Tim was going to follow his morning routine despite the cold 
Went to grab my food bag which was hanging up to keep away from the bears and other critters. It’s up about 15 ft in the air  When I got over to my bag it was sitting on the ground with scrapes and scratches all over. No sign of bear prints so I figured a raccoon had figured out how to jump over to the pole and unhook the bag. No matter at this point as I just wanted to get moving
Fortunately the trail out was an uphill climb.  That warmed me right up. 
When I stopped at and nice sunny shelter for breakfast I found that the raccoon had punctured 4 out of 5 of my special odorless food bags. Luckily they only damaged a few bars and my powdered eggs.  I bear bag didn’t stop it’s claws from puncturing the bag but they couldn’t cut it and open it up. So it worked as advertised!
went down to fill up on water and found my second (spare) water bag developed the same leak!  I can manage the leak by holding that spot closed while using my other hand to squeeze the bag to filter the water  hope it doesn’t spring another leak 
Aside from the climb out in the morning it was a pleasant day cold but short sleeves and gloves were all that were needed  passed through Caladonia State Park  Remembering family hikes while at Nawakwa 
Arrived at Quarry gap shelter through a tunnel of rhododendrons  this would be a beautiful walk when they are in bloom 
Met Tom x the caretaker of the shelter  he keeps it lick  a luxury accommodation  there are pansies and Lillie’s and hanging plants  he had just freshly painted the floors  there is a hanging chair a bench in the sun and a spring ten yards from the entrance 
One can easily see the care and time Jim had invested over the years  We hikers would not be able to do what we do without the support of Jim and the thousands of volunteers up and down the trail
oh and it’s going to be freezing again tonight  sleeping in my tent in the hopes it adds 5 degrees of heat  
I’m planning g on an early exit tomorrow","Tumbling Run Shelter
",Quarry Gap,"Apr 24, Mon",13.20
Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662750,"So I slept in the tent and yes it was warmer.  Tim said it was generally warmer and he slept in the shelter. I read the thermometer (yes the finer shelters have a thermometer) it said 30 so I don’t believe Tim’s assessment.  I went to bed with my socks my long PJs, a tee shirt a long shirt a button up long sleeve shirt my winter coat my sleeping bag liner and of course my bag.  Other than my rank hiking attire I had no other clothes to put on. So yes it was warmer. I slept till 4:30 before the cold work me. 
On waking Tom was still planning on eating in the cold  Like yesterday I set out  Again thankful for a long uphill out of camp to warm the bones (Hah the Body).  
The day steadily improved. Was hiking in a tshirt and pants after an hour. 
Had thoughts of The Last if the Mohicans and dad as that was one of his favorites. I felt I was one of the Iroquois (yea I know it’s the wrong state) walking the ancient pathways. But they would not have taken us up and down every hill between here and there
Or original plan had been to hike to Tom’s Run shelter, about four miles shorter, bit both Tim and I were running low on cooking fuel. As there was a general store at Pine grove we decided to go the additional miles    This store is the site of the infamous midway point where NOBO thru hikes eat a half gallon of ice cream  We we’re concerned that had store would close sooner than the 7pm time listed in the AT guide so I pressed on alone.  Upon arrival I found the store to be closed but fortunately the owners daughter was there making preparations to open and she let me buy the last canister of fuel  
We camped at the state park on a beautiful grassy patch.  More importantly the sun was shining and the temperature was pleasant.  It was the first time in the trip that I was relaxed at camp  
Although it was going to be cold at night the temps were going to be in the low 30s and I had learned to wear everything, the night did not hold as much dread as the last two nights","Quarry Gap
",Pine Grove Furnace State Park,"Apr 25, Tue",17.30
Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662769,"Woke up to a light rain but the cold snap is over.  Tim decide to skip breakfast and get on the trail. We headed out separately but I gave him bum directions. I planned to hit the pavilion and the big bathroom by Fuller lake. As I needed water and a bathroom that’s were I headed first and made coffee figuring Tim would be by shortly.  Tim went to the pavilion and had a bar breakfast figuring I’d be by shortly.   When I was done I thought I had missed Tim so I headed out. Well after five miles of not catching him I realized I was ahead and not behind. The day became sunny but slight cool. When I got to Tagg Run I decided to sit at the bridge and wait
Claire picked us up around 12:30. I was great to get off the trail and get a hot shower and sleep in a bed   She had prepared chicken and Ailsa/Brad’s famous giant sweet potatoes for lunch and for dinner.  After relaxing with a couple of Guinness and Paddy’s, Bob cooked a roast in the Sous vide with asparagus and baked potatoes. Excellent diner accompanied by Aja and Holly. 
We couldn’t have had a much welcoming and accommodating hostess and host. 
Thank you again sis","Pine Grove Furnace State Park

Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662802,"After the wonderful evening and dinner Claire had hot breakfast for before dropping us off at the trail. Wish she could be at every trail stop
Headed to Boiling Springs for some needed supplies at the outfitters. 
Camp is a nice grassy nook just outside of town with a picnic table. We are the only ones here at 6:45. It’s amazing. I’m not even wearing a coat. To bed early as we are setting a 4 AM alarm to get on the trail. We have a flat 13 m run across the Cumberland Valley before the final mile and a half with a climb of 1000 ft. Oh and it’s supposed to rain starting at 9 all day. Hence the early start to minimize the rain exposure 
First Snake sighting. Tim spotted it and yelp like a child  oh Yeah tim has been giving nothing it Sh**about not having a bear vault  I had to put some of his food in my bear bag because it wouldn’t fit in his vault!","PA 34
",Boiling Springs,"Apr 27, Thu",10.10
Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662897,"Woke up at four AM to get an early start. It’s supposed to rain the next three days. If we can get to the shelter(a three sided building with a roof) today we will spend the next night in a hostel (a multi bed room for cheap. Comes with a shower) and get a hot showers and a warm bed before spending another day in the rain on Sunday. 
Tim and I decided to split for the day so we could each go at our own pace. Began the mornings hike at 5:15 with headlamps. The breeze is picking up but the hike is 12 miles of flat across the Cumberland Valley. I kept up a 3 mph for most of the day
Not much to tell about the hike as I had my head down and just focused on speed. Made it just past RTP 81 before I had ti put on my rain gear. The rain was light but the combination of wet and a 15 mph wind quickly chilled me. At around mile 10 the rain started. So 2 miles more across the valley before hitting the 1000 for climb up to the ridge 
When I arrived at the shelter it was empty. Unfortunately the floor was made of six inch boards with gaps between the boards. The wind was coming in the open side and up through the floorboards. 
I immediately got out of my damp clothes and put on my dry set and every dry piece I had. Since we skipped breakfast I made oatmeal coffee and hot chocolate. This helped to counter the chill I had gotten but now completely banish it. Pretty much curled up in my sleeping bag and took a nap. 
Found a tarp in the shelter that was big enough to cover the open side   This helped cut the wind   Later to hikers Scape Goat and Mule pulled in.  They stated in GA in March and are planning be done by June 1. 3 months - they are averaging 20 m a day
the wind dropped around ten PM and I finally got warm

",Darlington Shelter,"Apr 28, Fri",14.80
Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662899,"Woke up to a weather surprise. It was supposed to rain but the updated report was for no rain all day. Yippee!
Took my time with breakfast as there was no rush for weather. Tim not feeling all that well. 
Easy start to the day but around mile 7 the rocks started. These are the type of paths that you have no choice but to walk on the rocks -  and no they are not flat. Most times it’s the edge of a rocks or a jumble of rocks   It’s hard to step in between because there is no In between 
The hostel in Duncannon has a rack of bucks in one room with a couple of chairs and sofas. And most important hot showers heat and a bed. 
We are contemplating or hike tomorrow. The weather is calling for 1-2 inches of rain","Darlington Shelter
",Duncannon,"Apr 29, Sat",11.40
Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662926,"Took our first Zero Day (hiked zero miles) as Tim was not feeling well yesterday. The benefit (and I think Tim secretly planned this) is that we didn’t have to hike in the pouring rain today. No worries that day will come. 
The hostel gave me a chance to recover from the stolen credit card number we experienced on my third day. 
We are already planning on how to make up for this day. 
We were planning a zero next weekend. Zeros are good for your body and mind to recover from the rigors of daily long distance hiking. 
In the next five days we have three consecutive 18 m days. It will be our next challenge","Duncannon
",Duncannon,"Apr 30, Sun",0
Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662997,"Today is about setting us up for the next three days. We are only planning 11ish miles because the following three days are 18 milers. This is our next test of what we can sustain. Our 12 mile average leaves too much time at camp. We are hiking 5-6 hours. I’d like to get it up to the 7-9 hour range. At 2 mph that’s 14-18 a day. Our trek to the schuylkill will take five days of 10.9, 18, 18, 18 and 8  
What governs our stops is the availability of water and shelters. In general we try not to sleep out in the pouring rain and only tent 1-2 nights in the rain. It’s important not to let our sleeping gear get wet as it is still dropping into the thirties at night 
Daytime highs are only in the 50s with sporadic rain. Tonight in the valley the low is 39. Up here on the mountain I expect low thirties and rain. So a shelter makes life much easier
Left the Susquehanna Valley this morning. It’s incredible how much noise mankind makes with its highways. I heard trucks and trains for 6 miles after crossing the river 
Met Katelyn and Thermal at the shelter.  They were just having lunch before pushing on to Clark’s Creek. They left HF in the 15 so I expect to catch them again in a day or so
Hansel and the other German kid stoped in as well before pushing on
Tim had a better day today   He is currently taking a nap because he can
Ran across an interesting seed pod that I’ve never seen before. If anyone knows what it is please let me know","Duncannon
",Peter’s Mt Shelter,"May 01, Mon",10.90
Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663162,"Peter’s shelter was a huge place. It had a loft and a picnic table inside. It could sleep about 30 if it was raining hard enough 
When I arrived Thermal and Katelyn were eating their lunch  they are also flip flopping. They are from Phoenix and Thermal has his name because even in AZ he wears thermal base layer. He must hate the cold here. 
As big as the shelter was it still felt cold. There was a wind and the temperatures got into the low 30’s again. 
I skipped breakfast again and decided I would stop at Clark’s creek about mile 7. As we were planning an 18, stopping for a break would be a good idea 
Walking is a great way to warm up even when there is light rain.  Sitting in a shelter you get no heat from moving as you have no place to roam. 
Passed Katelyn and Thermal just before the creek. After a long wet descent, there were multiple springs with fresh flow from the rains running down the trails. They are headed to the same shelter as us for the night 
While walking down the trails you could hear all the water running underneath the rocks   It would pop out here and there
Almost couldn’t get across the creek due the flooding from all the rain
leaving the creek I passed remnants of the old coal and iron mining operations   The creek was stained orange from all the iron and coal littered the rail line we walked for a bit.  
The day was on and off rain but seemed to be improving ever so slowly. Arrived at the Rausch shelter after a long 18. Tim and Thermal and Katelyn joined shortly thereafter 
I now have a trail name thanks to Katelyn. After telling my bear bag raccoon story she first suggested Bear Hang bit after some back and forth Raccoon seemed to have a  ether story
oh and I almost forgot. Micheal Dresser was the winner of name that object in yesterday’s picture. It is a GALL. A fall is an incubator for a type of wasp. If I had better internet I’d have more info. As with getting a new car after finding one gall I started to see them everywhere","Peter’s Mt Shelter

Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663190,"yes another cold night. I had planned to sleep in my tent for a little extra warmth but the threat of rain keeps me in the shelter. It’s just less hassle because I don’t have to pack a wet tent. 
Hiked most of the day with Tim. I felt out of rhythm because I had to keep taking clothes on and off   We keep hoping for a bit of warmth from the sun but it never happens. 
I stopped with about 6 to go. Sitting on an outcropping looking west towards Harrisburg. The N-S run of the Appalachian mts makes a sweeping curve to headed east across PA. As I was sitting there in the feeble excuse for a sun, I could see the rain marching in from the west. Tim passed and did stop. I put my full rain gear on And proceeded onward. 
I put it into high gear and made good time. And wouldn’t you know it, the rain never came  passed Tim and a few section hikers .  
Kevin and Chris you’ll appreciate this. Two miles to go and I meet the Beer Angel in the form of Applejack a through hiker from 2016  he was about 400 yards from his car and was happy to meet me  he had come out for an overnight hike and had brought Troeg’s Double Bock beer to dispense to any through hikers  I grabbed one for Tim as well and packed it up to the shelter. Needless to say it was most enjoyed after our s conf long day
this shelter had four walls, seats with backs and games  Alas it didn’t have heat and it was another cold night","Rausch Gap
",501 Shelter,"May 03, Wed",17.50
Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663192,"well we are starting our third week   The two long days didn’t kill us. We will step back a bit the next few days. 
It was cold again even in four walls. I have decided to up my sleeping bag gear. Saw a minus 20 degree bag. That should do the trick 
A througyhiker by the name of Atticus spent the night I. The key to a short hike duration is to hike many hours as he is not a fast hiker. To this end he preps his breakfast the night before. In a large Gatorade bottle he fills it 3/4 with water adds instant coffee and a carnation instant breakfast w protein and he pours in a pack of oatmeal.  Not sure that’s for me
The good news is that the forecast for tomorrow actually includes the sun. Let’s hope","501 Shelter

Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663315,"i actually slept well last night. Still bundled up as it gets to the low 40s. 
Met Candy and SimCard.  Candy suggests a 25 degree bag liner. We are stopping at Canbellas when we r in town. 
The day was wonderful. Had sunshine all the way into port Clinton. The trail was fairly easily annd we only had a short 8 miles to town.  And the the rains came (figuratively ).
Arrived town about 11:30. The post office where we were picking up our supplies was not open till 12:30. We were planning on catching a shuttle to cabellas a little after one. So we went to the hotel and got a beer. Now 12:05. I called to verify the pickup location and time and the woman told me 12:15!  Downed our beer and walked cross town. No shuttle. I call again and this woman says no not 12:15 1 and it’s always been 1. ok more time to kill
we run up to the post office and my box is not there. Of course I don’t have tracking number. I cobble together enough supplies for my leftovers and Tim’s oversupply and what’s in the hiker box so cover that issue 
 Kw I try calling the next PO to insure this is not a bigger problem. I’m automated phone hell for half hour till I get through. Good News. My next box is in position 
on to Cabellas where they only have one item on my ten item list. Good news is that we bump into Lost and  Stampede. Two guys our age who started the same day. We had crossed paths a couple of times but they were decidedly ahead.  It both of them were out of action due to shin splints
They are planning to rest a few days and jump ahead to NJ to avoid the PA rocks. As they will the restart slowly we are likely to catch up to them
Made our way back to the hotel thanks to a trail Angel who spotted us at cabellas and offered us a ride 
had a great dinner and more beer at the hotel before hiking up the 1000 foot climb to the tent site.  We decided on the extra hike to shorten the following days hike
If I can ever get it loaded I saw a newt at our campsite. It reminded me of the time I took my son Ian the the Delaware water gap to hike. We stayed up towards Sunfish pond but never got more than 1/4 miles because he became occupied with the newts and frogs.","Eagles Nest

Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663318,"Had our first fire last night. The night was calm and comfortable to start   Went to sleep with just PJs and until 4 in the morning it was fine. Then it got cold. Nonetheless it was a good night of sleep  and the day will end with a spaghetti diner. Friends Dirk and Sherri and brings us diner tonight!  The shelter is on a road so it works. What’s best is we don’t have to hike after eating. It’s all I will be thinking about 
Passed Pulpit Rock and The Pinnacle just east of Hawk Mountain. Ran through some rocky stretches but a lot of our hike today was through state hunting forest so we were on dirt roads. Got into the shelter around 2:30 and spent a pleasant afternoon in the sun. I even got to stomp on my dirty hiking clothes while I took a dribble shower in the not warm solar shower. At least I feel like my clothes got a little less dirty
Liam is trying to join us for an overnight hike. Tying to figure out the logistics. He only has three weeks for shipping out to Seattle for an internship with  Boeing. We’ll see if we can manage the logistics will everything else on his plate. Tonight should be a warm night. Looking forward to it.

Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663334,"This section is the where I have hiked most with Theresa. When I first met her I was excited first by the fact that I met her on a bike ride. I told her about my hikes with Tony and she was game to go on a hike. We did a day hike on this section and I was further impressed by her outdoorsyness (is that a word). I know I had a great time and she stuck around so I guess she did too. On this first hike I told her about my wish to hike the AT. She supported my desire and liked a guy who had goals. My timing could have been better but. . .
As the years went by we returned to this section. hiking Hawk Mountain and the areas around Port Clinton. She brought me up to Lake Placid and we hiked and snowshoes the mountains there. I was so glad to meet and fall in love with such a caring and energetic and beautiful woman who shared my athletic passions
Today we leave Ecksville and have a 1000 ft climb up to the ridge. This section becomes very rocky. Passing great views on rock outcrops known Adams The Pulpit, The Pinnacle, Dan’s Pulpit (got a religious theme going here) the Knives Edge, Bear Rocks and Bake Oven Knob 
Turns out each of these and in many places in between there are just a jumble of rocks left over from the ice age. PA was the southern limit of the glaciers.  They carried all the rock on the leading edge and deposited them in PA","Ecksville Shelter
",Bake Oven Knob,"May 07, Sun",17.40
Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663462,"All I could think about this morning was Jamberry Jam 
Spent the night in a shelter with American Fido and Oz while a newcomer Jkwim tented   I may have his name wrong today but I’ll get it right soon. He is from Athens GA and is section hiking to CT. He worked at the CertainTeed plant in Athens the same time is was doing the rebuild there. Small world!  He plans to finish in CT about the same time we will pass so I expect we will be seeing him several times 
after leaving the knob I kept thinking of the time Tony and hiked from the Lehigh west. When we crossed over the Northeast Extension in it must have been July, we sat down in the wild blueberry plant and just ate blueberries. This then brought to mind that bears like blueberries. So then I connected Jamberry Jam. It was a book that both Katelyn and Ian had to be read many many times. I think there was a cassette tape where the bear read the story. I couldn’t get out of my head the way he said Jamberry. Stretching the an out so it sounded like Jaaaaaambery Jam! Yeah!  Couldn’t get any more than then but since it was a glorious sunny spring day and trail became relatively easy after the first mile of rocks I had a most enjoyable morning hike. 
The trail was rerouted since I was last o. It. It now runs on the north side of Blue Mt and one gets to look out over the Lehigh river and palmerton. This is the only spot I have run into that is covered with wild blueberries. Sorry I’ll be missing them 
Meet Jkwim at the water spot before heading 1000 feet down to cross the Lehigh. Yes and then go up 1000 feet to get back up to the ridge. I think over the four rivers in PA this is the most difficult. Up the other side I kept thinking of the time Theresa Liam and I hike it. Of course Liam was capering ahead and all we could do is worry that he might slip. At what age does one stop doing that?
Two more nights and two more days and we are in Delaware Water Gap for a zero day.  Looking forward to washing my clothes, a good shower and maybe a Phil’s game on TV
Looking forward to next week as Liam May be able to join us for a couple of days the photo is the wild blueberry fields","Bake Oven Knob
",Tent Site near Little Gap,"May 08, Mon",12.90
Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663511,Rocksylvania. Yup that is how the hikers refer to our fair state. Let me explainin My experience hiking across 225 miles (15 more on our last day tomorrow) there are four general types of rock formations lect over by our friends the Ice Age. Type 1. The large car and refrigerator type boulder formation. I like this type. It makes me feel like a kid. You get to clamber from boulder to boulder   Sometimes you feel it’s a bit risky like the Knives Edge or the east side of the Lehigh Gap. It’s fun in an adolescent sort of way Type 2 these areas are just chock full of rocks. The saving grace is that there are big rocks mixt in. You cross these like you are crossing g a stream. Albeit a stream of rocks. These can go on for 1/4 or more.  It you get to step from big rock to big rock avoiding all the smaller stuff i between. I like these. Again it’s like crossing a stream but you are actually just walking down the rock stream Type 3. This is where it starts to get tricky   There are  bunch of small rocks and larger ones mixed in. You try stepping from one big one to the next but you always fall into the rock stream. You start to curse Type 4. Type 4 challenges your every footfall. These are Rick stream without any large rocks   Every step is a decision. Do I step on this pointy rock? Do is squeeze my foot between these two rocks?  Invariably you miss and you step on the pointy part in the middle of your foot.  Or you miss and get jabbed in the side of your foot or your ankle or you stub your toe or your trip etc etc etc. And now you are really cursing and just focused on getting out of the rock stream. Everyone is looking dory to the end of Rocksylvania The light at the end of the day is Dietzi’s tavern in Wind Gap. He allows hikers to set up tents in the back yard of the bar. Beautiful grass lot. He will give us coffee in the morning and drive us the mile back to the trail. All he asks in return is that we have a few beers at the bar and maybe a burger!  What a deal!,"Tent Site near Little Gap

Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663627,"Well PA didn’t make it an easy exit   We had a longish 16 mile hike to the Water Gap to finish the state and take our zero day. But it was more rocks. About the first 10-22 miles was more of the same. Thankfully the last few miles were a bit better. A little disappointed that we never got a good view of the gap
We have been seeing more ticks about. In fact a meet a woman who had one crawling up her face. Yes I did her the service of removing it. 
Spent the night in Marty’s Old Yellow House it’s a hostel or B&B in progress. He is a carpenter and home builder by trade. How he did that I can’t imagine. He has a million things in progress but nothing is finished. He was painting exterior, putting in a brick walk, rewiring, wallpapering, remodeling the kitchen, refinishing wood floors, building a staircase in the barn etc etc etc. nice guy and maybe worth a trip there in 3 years.","Wind Gap

We had planned to hike a 15 and a 10 but we want to trim some days in anticipation of going slow over the mountains up north.  So a 25 is in the cards. What a mistake. I spent 11:30 to make that distance. That includes the stops. There were enough rocks to make it still challenging. Not as bad as PA but bad enough. I think 20 would have been just fine.

Today was a challenge. Up and over Killington. A 3000 ft climb. The saving grace is that these trails generally wind their way up. We had about 5 miles of ups and downs and a gradual rise of 1000 ft. Then up the last 2000 over 4 miles. Not a steep climb but it did take hours of constant climbing. It slowly wears on you. 
At the top we skirted the summit and then down 200 ft to a shelter and water. At this point we could have take a side trail to see the summit but it was 0.2 miles and 350 ft up.

Our destination was the On theEdge Farmstand. I got a strawberry rhubarb pie - individual size and yogurt , local cheese and pepperoni for lunch   The place was beautiful and for sale. The owner really took care of us hikers. She had a portapotty , fresh water, trash cans and picnic tables. 
After that the VT flat terrain started again. VT flat is just 400-600 ft climbs and descents. One after the other. When you look at a map you think it’s flat because you compare it to the 4000 ft killington Mt and these seem flat. The total ascent today and yesterday was more than when we climbed Killington. 
Yup and our sunny day had two rain events. The last one before camp had big raindrops. Still not wearing rain gear though. 
Into camp and the sun came out again. You just get used to the constant moisture 
And I can’t forget the Pink Girls. Don’t know their names but I passed them about halfway here. The first one I passed had pink hair. She must have been 70. The second one had pink everything on.

Slept in our tents and it was dry all night. The night was comfortable. I slept without my 25 degree liner for the first time!  
The trail was easy for the first two miles and then downhill for the next four. Mostly soft earth. 
Had a quick break at the Blue Barn. The family accommodates hikers and I had a hard boiled egg, an apple and a cupcake! 
Leaving the barn in West Hartford we had a hill to climb. It was generally easy. After a couple of up and downs we started the big climb. Again easy and mostly sunny.  
We passed through several pine forests. They leave a soft carpet of needles to walk. Did get rained on twice. Enough to put the pack cover on but neither lasted for long. 
Passed several open meadows that were full of blackberry bushes. We have been seeing these since MA. They are all in flower so no berries for a couple of months. Just bad timing on our part 
Eager to make time as we headed for the NH border and Hanover. I was fantasizing about stopping at the Connecticut River. Dunking my head and soaking my feet. Unfortunately it didn’t happen. The river was unapproachable as i crossed the bridge over to NH. So I stopped and the way into town, took a cat bath and changed my shirt. Dartmouth was right in town. I went to Starbucks, got a coffee took my boots off and sat on a bench and just watched the people go by. Tim showed up about 1/2 hour later and we just relaxed until our hostel shuttle arrived. Stayed at the Hanover Adventure Tours Hostel back in Norwich VT
At the hostel Tim’s brother in law brought us beer. He was motorcycle touring New England and happened to be in the area
Our plan was to slackpack on Saturday because the hostel offered this as a service. The management was a disaster and couldn’t find a driver even though we had scheduled it. We got lucky. A section hiker, Heather, agreed to be our driver. 
A slackpack is when you carry a day pack 5-10 lbs instead of your 30 lb pack. Often you get driven up the trail and you hike back to the hostel. The next day they drive you back to the same spot and you continue in normal hike mode. It allows you a bit of a break.

Since we can’t afford to loose a day because we have a firm date in the Presidential Mountains at a lodge, we decided to slackpack in the rain and stretch the distance to 20. 
The hostel was supposed to drive us to the spot but they failed to get a driver. We got lucky as a section hiker, Heather, was willing to drive us. 
It had rained through this night but the drive out was just misty. Alas when we started hiking the rain started with us. I donned my jacket and walked the first flat two miles past a metalworker who fashioned Easter Island Statues as lawn art
Then the climb started and off came the jacket. Lo and behold the rain slacked as well. 
Made good time as the climb was long and not too high. I kinda got lost in my music as there was nothing to see. Everything was just dripping and the rocks and roots were slippery. I just focused on footing and trying to keep my feet dry. 
Did great on those fronts until I can to a couple of open fields. The grass was wet and hanging in the trail so it pretty much soaked my socks which then ran into my boots. To add injury the trail was the drainage for the field. There was nowhere to step but in the puddles. Came out of the fields thinking I could manage another eight miles without to much trouble 
Next came to lowland streams. Swollen. The rock and wood bridges were just enough to get across. But the approaches were swamped and you had to step through some of it. Still managing ok until the wood “bridge”.  Sometimes they cut a half dozen logs and lay them parallel to make a bridge across a muddy or wet area.  When I stepped on the third log in in was a floater. My left fort went in up to my calf. My entire boot was soaked. I had to stop and put the water out. 
As I was moving fairly quickly and got to town after two hours in that boot I figured I had gotten through the day pretty well
Back at the hostel hikers who were coming from VT said they had gotten a lot of rain. I was telling them that I hardly had any and we got 20 miles in. A good day in my bookThe photo shows the stream err I mean the trail at one point.","Hanover

When we got to the top it was just down the backside to the start of the next climb. Limited shelters in this area so we planned to camp wherever we could. The guides indicated a spot with a privy and water but the reviews were bad. The shelter at this location burned down some years back. 
It was a long day. I was tired of going up hills in the fog and mist and damp and mud etc etc etc. We had a nice first summit.  Nothing to take photo of as it was listed in   We had quite a few rocks to climb, some like the page photo were pretty slick  
While hiking up the last mountain I stopped to get something out of my left boot. Turned out there was nothing in it. Just the beginning of a blister.

Also this might be the highest climb in New Hampshire. Not by absolute elevation but by elevation gain. And that is what is most important to a hiker. It has a 3000 ft gain followed by a 3000 foot descent. While Mt Washington is taller it only has a 1500 ft gain. 
We got dropped at Kinsman’s Notch. From there we started up. Very steep. Rocks and man made stairs.  
The trail goes up alongside the beaver falls. It is a stunning hike. The falls go on for about a mile   I was stopping every 100 yards to marvel at the views. I was dreaming of sitting under the falls but they were very steep. It took me an hour to go a mile. Partly due to the terrain but also due to the number of times I just witnessed the beauty of nature. 
4.5 miles to the top. Our first bald mountain above the tree line. Sun was out. It wasn’t cold. Still a bit cloudy but the view from the top was the most spectacular so far. A preview of the White Mountains.  That is if we get any views. I am making a list of climbs that I would like to come back a do with Theresa  this is a definite.

Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666076,"Leaving Kinsman’s Notch the trail went right up for about 800 feet before turning into a gradual climb of another 500 feet before dropping us down 500 feet so we could start the climb up Wolf Mountain
This climb covered 900 feet up and 1000 down. It was challenging. But nothing compared to South Kinsman. 
South Kinsman was 1500 feet. Steep. After the first 900 feet of Rick to rock climbing I had to put my poles away and clamber or scramble up the rocks.    The most challenging climb so far. 
About halfway up Kinsman, as I was crossing a small one step east creek after a marshy area, I was standing on a rock when I lost my balance. I spun backwards and landed on my shoulder ending up on my back in the marsh.  I was a turtle who could not right himself or get up. Unclipped my pack and was able to get up and asses the damage. Wet pants wet boots wrenched shoulder. But otherwise ok. 
About 3/4 of the way up I noticed that my garmin transponder was not on my pack. I keep it clipped to the front shoulder strap. It was gone!  This is the device that lets my friends and family see where I am. This is the device that allows me to txt When I have no cell service!  This is the device that will allow me to send an SOS if I have an emergency!  
Luckily I was high enough on the mountain to have cell service.   I was able to track myself and see where the device was. Great to give my a general location but not sure I would be able to pinpoint the exact spot if my cell service didn’t hold. 
Now I dropped my pack in the woods and headed back down the rock trail. After about 0.1 miles I ran into Seadog who picked up my garmin!  It was hanging on a branch near the spot where I fell. It would seem that somehow the carabiner unclipped and it landed in this branch, or the branch slipped into the carabiner and unclipped it. It’s a mystery how this could have happened. It’s amazing that Seadog found it on the tree and decided not to leave it for someone else to find. 
We had a great view behind us. We could see Mt Moosilauke.  It’s always great to be able to see where you have been. It’s not always easy to look ahead to where you are going without having a map.  Mostly we only is an app called Far Out which doesn’t give one a sense of the surrounding area. 
Dropping down a few hundred feet brought us to the climb of North Kinsman and another steep decent down to the pond and the lodge.

Leaving the shelter this morning we immediately descended. I lost the trail as we crossed over a creek. I was standing in the woods and the trail just disappeared!  Turned around and went to the creek. Actually a waterfall. Not big but tumbling down the mountain. All along the trail there have been white blazes. A 2”x6” white strip of paint on tres or rocks.  When there is a turn there will be two blazes which will generally indicate a turn and in which direction. The Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) doesn’t seem to follow the apple of these blazes like everywhere else we have been. Also side trails are marked by a blue or other color blaze. 
I backtracked to the trail just before it crossed the waterfall. No double blaze!  I looked down the waterfall and sure enough there was a blaze about 100 feet down the waterfall. So down I go. Scrambling down this creek/waterfall for about 500 ft.  Left the creek but kept going down and often scrambling down rock faces for about 1000 ft. 
After descending two miles we arrived at the Lonesome Lake Hut, the first of the AMC run huts. These are hotels in the woods for hikers. You get dinner, a bed with pillow and two blankets and breakfast in the morning.  Great place to stay except.  Except for the fact that you must reserve in advance which is difficult sometimes for us the predict more than a few days in advance and we often don’t have cell service. Oh and the cost is $150/night per person non-refundable non-transferable. 
But the huts are fabulous. The leave the leftovers out for hikers to eat.  They also have fresh baked goods. For $2 and they have some hiker resupply stuff 
After such a slow start, I think it took Tim 2 1/2 hours to get down and it took me 1 1/2, we were questioning if we would make it through the planned 15 miles. Continued on down. We started at 3750 ft and went back down to 1500 ft to cross under I 93. 
Headed straight back up to 4755 ft for the summit of Little Haystack Mountain. A challenging climb withe some scrambling it boy was it worth it.  It was a beautiful day, not a cloud in the sky and we were above tree line again. Looking ahead we could see our first presidential mountain, Mt Lincoln.  A clear walk across relatively smooth path. Stopped on Lincoln to take in the views. Clear view of Mt Washington, the highest peak until Mt Katahdin. All around all one can see are mountains. The look like waves rolling out in all directions. Photos just can’t capture to complexity and depth of what you see up here. As humans walking or driving around down in the valley you just  can’t comprehend have vast this are is. 
Luckily for us the hiking was easier up here so we made up some time. Of course we dropped off these ranges so we could fit in one more 900 ft climb over Mt Wolf.  Descending Wolf I had my head down watching my footsteps and just trying to get to the shelter just as quick as I could. As I was going down it wasn’t very fast. I know I should have been close to the shelter but wasn’t seeing any sign. It felt wrong.  Sure enough the next blaze I saw was BLUE!  Now I had to go back up the f’in mountain 0.2 miles.

Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666169,"The AMC predates the AT. I don’t know how long. The AMC was granted the authority to build the hut and trail system long before the AT was conceived by the US Forest Service. The entire White Mountain area is covered in trails and huts. The Crawford Trail which goes up to Mt Washington was created in 1819. The AT not until the 30’s I believe. 
The AT has shelters and tent spots that are free to hikers.  It so in the Whites. You are very limited in where you can stay that doesn’t require a reservation and $150 a night. The tent sites are all wood platforms. Great if you have a free standing tent which many people have. Thru-hikers tend to have tents that must be staked out. But you can’t drive a stack into a piece of wood. 
These limitations, plus the threat of rain and thunderstorms for the next week are making it difficult to pick our next site. 
Coming down the mountain we had no reception so could not even try to make a reservation at the next Hut. 3 miles down we go to route302. The AMC  visitor center was up the road 2 miles. Tim got down a bit after I so we started up the road. Luckily we got a ride. 
At the center I was able to make a reservation for the Mizpah hut, only 3 miles from the center. The rain was rolling in. Clouds concealed the mountains. Not knowing how difficult a climb we had ahead, Tim started out. I had to wait for Seadog so I availed myself of the breakfast buffet 
Just as I was leaving, the rain let loose. Donned my rain gear. Got about 1/4 mile and the rain slackened and the climb started. Off came the rain gear. 
The climb was not too difficult and the hut was dry. 
Tomorrow we have a 5 mile hike to the Lake of the Clouds hut which is at the base of Mt Washington. This will leave us a short 1.5 mile climb to summit. 
My son Ian and my friend John Broshard were planning to meet us at Lake of the Clouds and hike two days with us. Due to the weather they both decided not to come. As much as I am disappointed, I am glad they did not come and have to deal with such crappy conditions. 
When we attempt the summit we will be above treeline for 8 miles. Should we be exposed to lightning we will be in danger. The have called for thunderstorms all day today but so far nothing. Not even that much rain. We will be tracking the weather to see if we can cross safely. 
Our destination is a tent site about 11 miles from our hut. Would have been a magnificent view if the weather was in our favor. Now it’s just miles we have to cross to move forward.

Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666230,"Today we were planning to do the Presidential loop.  From the 8 o'clock position at Lakes of the Clouds, the plan was to hike to the 2 o'clock position and stop at the Osgood Tent site about 11 miles.  Forecast - rain, wind, but not thunderstorms until tonight.  If we were feeling up to it at mile 11, we were going to continue down to the 4 o'clock position and stay at the Joe Dodge Lodge, about 15 miles.
Tim started at about 7:30 and Seadog and I followed about 8 or so. I left the hut in shorts and a T-shirt but as soon as I turned the corner of the hut the wind hit me.  Back inside to down rain gear - pants and jacket.  As we were already at 5000 ft, the climb to Mt Washington at 6,293 was not that high.  The trail was not bad, a little rocky but generally easy to get up.  We were in the clouds so there was a constant moisture in the air even when it wasn't raining. The rain came and went periodically up the mountain.  The trail was full of running and standing water.  Just water everywhere.  There apparently was 4 inches of rain last night with the full thunderstorm/lighting package.  I never heard it.
On top of Mt Washington I was to meet Tim.  Visibility was 25 ft.  A local hiker we were with, John, had said that the top was closed for renovations.  Three of the buildings i could find said closed for renovations.  The fourth, a gift shop and hiker lounge should have been open 15 minutes ago.  I tried using my phone to see if I could find out anything about the visitor center, but everything was wet so I couldn't get the phone to do anything.  Couldn't even take a picture.  I didn't see Tim anywhere so I assumed he just went forward.
Leaving the summit we went down the north side of the mt.  Had to cross over the cog-railway track.  The trail crossed the track at what seemed like the track's highest elevation from grade - about 4 ft.  I learned here that the metal tip of my pole had come off.  The track was supported by several stacked rail ties.  As i planned my tipless pole it skidded off and I fell off the track. Hit my quad on the rail ties but fortunately landed on my back on my pack.  The pack saved my back.
Picked myself up and moved forward.  About 1 mile down the trail I was able to find a leeward spot.  Dug out a dry cloth from my pack to dry the phone.  Noted Tim had been waiting at the Visitor center on top and was wondering where we were.  Apparently I didn't search in the right place.  He made the decision to skip the rest of the hike and take a shuttle bus to the Joe Dodge Lodge since he did not want to tent in the rain and he knew it would be difficult to finish the hike to Joe Dodge.  I was able to make a call to Tim and review the strategy.  Hopefully Joe Dodge would be my finish.
At this point I told Seadog that I was going to put the press on so that I could make it to Joe Dodge, or at least had the option to try after we got to the Osgood tentsite.  Almost immediately Seadog was dropping off.  He was spending time talking to John instead of hiking.  I would periodically wait for him to catch up.  Luckily it did because I did not secure the raincover on my pack after talking to Tim and it blew off without my knowledge.
Seadog fell so again I was waiting.  He was ok but taking his good ole time.  I decided I just had to go at my pace.  Pushing up and around Mt Jefferson (sometimes the trail avoids the peak - rarely but this time there was no point in making the summit as you couldn't see a thing) the wind was blowing at about 50 mph with a driving rain and mist.  Luckily it was off my back right shoulder.
Made it 7 miles to Madison hut at 1:00.  That was a long 5 hour hike for 7 miles.  The hope was that after the Madison descent, the trail would become easier.  Waited till 1:30 and messaged Seadog.  No response.  John did make it to the shelter and he told be that Seadog had fallen again and broke the handle off of one pole.  He stopped to fix it and told John he would be slowing down.
So up the boulder Mt Madison.  I had to put my poles away and simple scramble up the 1/2 mile to the summit.  Somewhere in there, as i had stretched my arms above me to pull up I heard a pop and felt stabbing pain in my left shoulder.  I quickly pulled my arm back and heard another pop and the stabbing pain went away.  The shoulder was a little sore.  I figured I must have dislocated my shoulder, not the gruesome dislocation I imagined where you have to go have someone relocate it, but only partially (I had no idea if that was possible, only what I imagined).  My choice was to go back to the hut where they would tell me I had to hike down the mountain to get attention since I was not incapacitated in anyway, or continue on.  So on I went.
At the top of Madison, I was again in the driving wind, but now I had turned the corner and was headed into the wind.  Down the eastern side of Madison it was bolder hopping in the rain and wind.  Still worried about lightening and thunderstorms (even though not forecast) I wanted to get down below the tree line.  One and a half miles to the tree line - stopping at rock cairns waiting for the mist to move so I could see the next cairn, I finally made it to the tree line about 3:30.  I figure I was hiking at around 1 hour per mile.Out of the wind finally, fewer rocks on the trail, I was able to go a little quicker.  Made it to Osgood around 4:00 leaving only 5 more miles to go.  Still no word from Seadog.  The 5 miles to Joe Dodge was relatively flat as it went along the contour lines through the woods.  Other than two angry stream crossings, the trail was good.  At the stream there was no way to get across by rock hopping.  At this point you just decide to step in the stream and soak your shoes.  Anything else is just adding risk.  Sloshing out of the stream I made Joe Dodge at 6:30 - 5 hours for 8 miles.What a please Joe Dodge was.  It's more of a hotel than a hut.  They had HOT SHOWERS!  A boot dryer (really for snowshoeing) and hot food.  Met up with couple, Strider(?) and Songbird, whom we have crossed paths with before.  They are in their 50 I'm guessing.  They had made the same hike from Madison in 7 hours.   Songbird had decided to end her hike as she needed to get back to work in July (see was allowed 4 1/2 months off) and she didn't see the point in hiking in the rain for another week.","Lakes of the Clouds Hut

Forecast - rain! 
Didn't really feel like hiking today.  Tim left early as always, I lingered another hour so didn't get out the door until 8:30.
Todays hike featured not one, not two, not three, not four, but five mountain climbs.  The first being the longest at 3000 ft.  The remaining were from 500-900 feet.  Somewhere during the second descent, as i was lowering myself down another rock face, my shoulder popped again.  It quickly popped in again but at this point I decided I needed to see a doctor. While my shoulder was a little painful it was not prohibiting my movement.  My fear was that it would become fully dislocated while hiking up or down a rockwall or that I would slip on a rock or a wet board or a root.  There I would be without the ability to use my shoulder.  I decided to go off trail and get it looked at.
My googling of a shoulder separation, even partial, was that I would be in a sling for 4 weeks and then a course of rehab.  The reality being that I was done for the season.  The idea of not finishing even the northern half was disappointing.  The idea of not hiking in the rain for two more weeks was a relief.  My bigger concern is that I have just gotten my health back after the cancer and now I may be incapacitated for another month or two.  Hopefully that's not the case.
Arrived at IMP shelter, a nice four sided shelter with an open door.  Diner was in the rain sitting on a low log.  Didn't linger over dinner.  Had a conversation with Tim about my leaving the trail in Gorham.  He is of a like mind and understood that I need to stop and see what up with the shoulder.","Joe Dodge Lodge

Raccoon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666234,"With rain in the afternoon forecast we both left the shelter around 6:30.  Eight miles with some small climbs and a long downhill.  We wanted to beat the rain before getting to town.
Trail had a climb to start then several smaller, more gradual climbs, kinda feels like the mountains are getting more gentle.  Still wet but not a lot of running water.  Arrived at Rattle River which also was heavily swollen.  Not way around or over so we committed to fording the rivers (3 crossings).  Cleaned our boots off, but now our feet were soaked - a recipe for blisters for sure.  Only another 1 1/2 to the road to Gorham so not too bad.  
Was hoping to get a shuttle ride, but none of the services were responding.  With a 3 mile walk to town and rain just starting, we began the road walk while trying to hitch a ride.  Two bearded old guys aren't usually gettin a ride, but we got lucky and caught a ride.
At the post office, Tim's box had not arrived - apparently it was in Maine, I picked up my resupply and the replacement pack that Osprey offered after the squeaking noise I had reported 6 weeks ago.   Right next to the post office was a liquor store.  Store celebrate/commiserate my last day we got a bottle of bourbon and some bitters.  Off to the bar for a beer and pulled pork sandwich.  At the bar I asked the bartender for a couple of slice of orange.  She did even better by giving me a whole orange.
We drank a bit that afternoon.  Had dinner and in bed by 8.  My outbound bus is at 7:50 to Boston.  From there I will stop at Ian and Jackies house for a few days, and then a train to home.  I have an appointment on Thursday.
As of now I am planning one more entry as I believe I will not be hiking more this year.  Once I have a prognosis I will make one more entry.","Imp Shelter
