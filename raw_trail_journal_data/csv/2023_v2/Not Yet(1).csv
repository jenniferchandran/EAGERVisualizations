Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660231,"Just a short note here. Things are becoming real. I've booked my plane tickets. Luckily, my start point which is Catawaba is near Roanoke and that small city has an airport with reasonable-priced flights in. I've booked a hotel for the first night - my plan is to go to the Dick's Sporting Goods in town and get some camp fuel and anything else that TSA confiscates or the airline loses and then the next morning see if I can get a cab or Uber to the trailhead which is about a dozen miles away. It's a heady first day - I'll be on McAfee's Knob (google it if you don't know, it's probably the second most famous picture you've seen of the AT, the first being the sign on top of Katahdin) and I might hit the other two sites on the Virginia Triple Crown that first day.About me, I've got about 600 miles of the AT under my belt already, still have a scar running down the left side from rib to belly button from Mahoosuc Notch, so I figure that this section should be enjoyable and very doable compared with the Whites and Southern Maine. I'm starting in mid-April which hopefully puts me ahead of the bubble, but doesn't have me starting in freezing weather (hopefully). I'm looking forward to having Spring happen around me as I head North.So, that's it for now. I'll probably post a couple more times before I start.",,View Entry,"Feb 23, Thu",0
Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660905,"So I figured I'd go over what I do physically to prepare for one of these hikes as a reference point in case there are other folks my age who want to look and then see the results as I progress on the trail. The main exercise I do is to carry a weighted backpack. I've been doing this for years. For this hike, I've been walking with a Rucker backpack from GoRuck (https://www.goruck.com/product...) with the hip belt attachment, a 30 lb ruckweight and a 10 lb ruckweight. I walk about four days a week for about two hours a day on terrain that has some steep hills. They're probably comparable to an easy day on the AT, something like the Cobble Hill trail in Massachusetts if you need a reference. When I did this last year, then put on my backpack to do the real hike, the backpack felt pretty light in comparison. It really helped me hit the ground running.
I'm also taking some trainer-supervised gym classes this year. I didn't do that last year, no time, now that I'm retired, it's easy for me to slot these into my schedule. These are pretty intense for an older (65 years old) guy like me and I'm definitely near the bottom of the class in what I can do. The classes start off with a warm-up: yoga-type stuff, some strength movements with light weights, core stuff and stretches. Then there's usually a weightlifting component - deadlifts, squats, bench press, that kind of thing. And then there's the aerobic section, often an AMRAP style thing working through as many repetitions of a few exercises as you can do in 20 minutes, e.g. a 400m bike / row / run, a bunch of plank pull-throughs, burpees, box jumps or jump ropes, and then some sort of lifting movement. It has me beat afterwards, but I think this year, I'm better-rounded physically, maybe 5 pounds lighter and I have good stamina compared to last time. But proof is in the pudding, we'll see how I do. The goal isn't just to do 1/3 of the AT, it's to do it as easily and enjoyably as possible for someone in my age range.
I practiced packing my bags for the plane. Dixie, if you've seen her videos, has a great resource for this (link below). Long story short, anything that is pointy or a liquid goes in a check-in bag, anything that has a battery in it or is vaguely flammable (for instance a lighter) is a carry-on. My plan is to split my stuff between a duffel-bag that I don't feel bad about throwing away (checked bag) and my backpack (carry on). My trekking poles, tent poles and penknife go in the checked bag as do any fluids (olive oil, hand soap, sanitizer, toothpaste, bacitracin ). My Anker battery, phone, electric lighter (a gift from my son), In Reach and headlamp go in the carry on. The rest of the stuff I can split between. I'm going to put my clothes and sleeping bag in a compression sack and put that in my backpack. The duffel can hold my sleeping pad (one of those closed-cell ones, very bulky), my bear canister with the smellables  and my first-aid / personal items. I'll put my camp stove in the carry-on too. I figure that it's a little less threatening in there - TSA says it can go as either carry-on or checked though. There is a Dick's Sporting Goods in Roanoke and I'm hoping they have isobutane fuel canisters, otherwise I'm cold-soaking for a while. You definitely don't want to bring one of those on the plane, checked or carry-on. I may bring one of those Talenti gelato jars that so many people used in 2022 for that.",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Sat",0
Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661453,"It's less than two weeks until I start - I'm posting this one mostly so I reach the three-post milestone which makes my posts go public. Kate and I drove down to Winchester, Va. to help my son and his wife to move into their new home. He has a view out his bedroom window of Hogback Mountain and the whole ridge from Front Royal north through the Shenandoah Valley. I'll be staying with them after I finish the Shenandoah National Park.We drove about 1/2 of Skyline Drive. I have the senior National Parks lifetime pass, so it was a no-brainer to do it. It's late March and we are on the cusp of Spring. The weather was a little cold and overcast, with occasional showers, but we were able to take in the great views. There are pull-offs every couple of miles and unobstructed views. We were even able to put our feet on the AT in places - it was a great way to bring my son, Daniel and Kate into my hiking life. The park was ours to enjoy - there were very few other cars at this time of year, there were a couple of groups of day hikers, no noticeable thru-hikers. One rest stop in the park was open, but campsites still have their gates closed. I've heard that they don't open until May 2.The cold weather and rain gave me pause. The oaks are all bare - not even any flowers yet. The understory has just begun to green up. We saw three deer taking advantage of that. My last hike was in June and July and it was short sleeve weather the whole way, even on Mt. Washington and in Maine. I'm going to be a few thousand feet above sea level with nighttime temperatures in the 30's. I've been out overnight in colder weather, but not for such a sustained period of time. There's always a bit of fear at the start of a new adventure and the mind tends to try to find something palpable to attach that fear to. For me I guess it's the cold. My plan is to bring my puffy (only for camp), a decent shell to shed rain, wool cap, light gloves, a long-sleeve baselayer, some lightweight long underwear bottoms, and a lightweight hoodie fleece. My sleeping bag is rated to 20 degrees and I tolerate the cold well, so at worst with the long underwear and the puffy, I should be good in camp. I'll have three layers if it's raining - the long-sleeve shirt, the fleece and the shell and having the gloves and hat will add comfort.I may be overdoing it when it comes to bringing clothes. We will see. I can always send stuff home after Shenandoah.The other fear is the trek through the Shenandoahs. That's a bit over 100 miles from Waynesboro to Front Royal and at this time of year, there's no resupply along it. I checked and it seems like campsites have bear poles, so my plan is to bring a bear hang bag and my bear canister and just for the Shenandoahs to put food in both (my canister is a Bear Vault 450 which holds about 4-5 days of food). Hopefully, I can do 15 mile days and make it through in six nights. I looked it up and that would be about 3000 feet of vertical gain per day which is well within my capabilities, even so early in the hike.Oh well, if not, I'll just call in a favor with Daniel and get him to pick me up on Skyline Drive. Is that cheating?",,View Entry,"Mar 31, Fri",0
Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662059,"So it is the first day on the trail and it had to be a short one. There is no shelter between here and Daleville so it was either 20 miles and another night in a hotel or here. It has been a hot day with a still wind. I am more than fine with stopping early.
The day started at the Mainstay Suites in Roanoke. I had flown in yesterday and lugged my stuff the mile to the hotel from the airport. This morning, I woke up early (3 Krispy Kreme donuts for breakfast) and got a Lyft from Dave whose daughter and wife had done the hike to McAffee Knob early enough to be there at dawn. He had never hiked it himself and I was his first client to the trailhead so it was new for both of us.
A friend of mine had suggested that I begin my hike by asking the land for permission and  see what happened. This filled me with trepidation. There are so many reasons why I would not receive permission. I am walking on dubiously ceded land walked by native American ancestors. The land itself could deny me. But I did it anyway, holding the thought in my mind. When I looked down, there was a blue flower. It was beautiful and I have said before that beauty is an instinct that allows us to know what is good. So land showing it's beauty to me, I took that as an open gate and went up.
It is the cusp of spring here. Down below, the oak and birch are just starting to leaf out. I saw two times, a squirrel with a sprig of birch leaves in its mouth. What gives? I will refrain from making a guess. There were also two deer and much later a small black lizard. The understory here is mostly leaf litter. Some moss is there but it has that dormant olive color it takes in winter. Above, there are mountain Laurel and some bush that my app said was Andromeda. It had small white bell shaped flowers and shiny black-green leaves, just a little smaller than mountain Laurel. There are a lot of flowers, dandelions, even some daffodils. There were flowering trees including dogwoods.
So the climb to McAffee's Knob is pretty easy. There are two paths up, the AT and a blue blazed forest road which is supposed to take less energy to do. I did that AT to get up there. At the top, it winds around large boulders, either sandstone or limestone, I can't tell. Then there is a simple sigh saying ""overlook"". This is for the AT's most iconic view, you could easily pass it by. The view is spectacular, mountains across from you with the cuts from streams in them looking like the ribs of some giant beast. The thing is set up with two precipices. One person stands on the left one and takes a picture of the person on the right one and inevitably you get one of those heroic photos that highlight the subject. I have met a gentleman and his 17 year old son and took that picture for them. We are staying together tonight with about 5 ridgerunners who maintain the shelters and instruct the hikers.
After McAffee Knob, I descended to a point where you can see it from below. It is a knob. The rock of it just out from the mountain. There was one beautiful view on the way to Tinker Cliffs, a lake hidden among rugged mountains. Then you go up. It was the hottest part of the day and it kind of wore me out. Tinker Cliffs is a mass of gigantic blocks with 50 or 100 foot faces and the AT goes along the top of it. There are nice views along the way.
So now I am at the shelter hanging out. Maybe I will stop typing and be social now.","McAffee Knob trailhead

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662062,"Today was a short one, finished before 1:00. The weather report was not good. It is going to rain most of the afternoon and it will rain heavily tonight with thunderstorms. Daleville was about 10 miles from the Lambert's campsite, so when I reached it I just called it for the day. Call me a wuss, I don't care, I am out here to enjoy myself.

The morning was gorgeous though. I woke up well before dawn, even before the birds. They started in on me as I was eating my breakfast. I think there was a Hermit Thrush in the mix but I thought his song was a little lacking compared to the ones in Vermont. Still, they are some of the best singers, even this middle of the road guy had the most delicate and graceful melody and he did some improvisation on it as well. By the time I had packed, dawn had started and there was plenty of light to go on.
There were a lot of overlooks today. The first one was as dramatic as McAffee's Knob. There were mountains to the East, big ones, possibly the Shenandoahs or at least big mountains leading up to them. The sun was rising over them, with today's clouds, they were orange. Also orange were the mountains to my west, the morning light picking at their hollows with dramatic shadows. Later overlooks featured ledges and shelves of the stone here, either sandstone or limestone I am guessing. Some of the structures were precarious and striking.
More spring. I walked along a rocky ridge for much of today and I think there are lots of blueberries in the understory, just leafing out with white and red bell shaped flowers. If they are blueberries there will be a lot of happy hikers and bears in July. Near the end, the trail dips down into a glen filled with small trees with purple flowers and something whose flowers look like honeysuckle but smaller. They smelled amazing. Shortly after, I crossed some train tracks and entered Daleville. They have a nice outfitter. I bought new trekking poles - the old ones, a gift from my son Ryan, were beat to pieces and the tips were worn down to nothing. Thank you Ryan, thank you old trekking poles. Next door is an Asian food place, they were very nice to me, especially considering that with the rain (I had got caught in a very refreshing shower), I probably smelled like a wet dog.

One last thing, the trail here is extremely well maintained by the Roanoke Appalachian Club. Lots of steps, a really well thought out placement and often a very soft surface, sand or leaf litter. Thank you guys and gals.","Lambert campsite

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662125,"First a shout out to the Roanoke A.T.C. The trail today was beautifully laid out with switchbacks and a really nice read of the terrain so that you had a gradual and almost imperceptible climb throughout the day. Last year, I met a hiker whose trail name was Never Better (he meant it ironically: coming into the shelter, bleeding from one leg, out of the freezing rain, his lips blue, you'd ask him ""how are you doing?"". He'd answer ""nnnnever bbbetter"".) Anyway he had a theory that it wasn't the miles that you did but the elevation gain for the day that determined what was possible. Today was a 4400 ft elevation gain, for reference, the average through the Shenandoahs for me will be about 3000 a day. Yet, I did not feel it.. so much.
The day started with intermittent showers, not bad, through farmland at sunrise. There were some of those nice orange early morning mountain vistas from the top of one of the fields. There are flowers everywhere, that fragrant one that looks like small honeysuckle, violets and today some azalea bushes. The rain last night was hard and washed all of the leaf litter off the trail leaving the orange clay. There was not much mud. The rain has also brought the moss and lichen alive. The moss was spring green and the lichens were prominent and pliant. Both plants respond quickly to any moisture and they sure got that last night.The trail winds up into the mountains. There are a couple of glens with nice brooks running through them and there are some fantastic tent sites next to them. You would spend all night listening to the water. There were minnows in the brook, go figure how the poor things swam all the way up here.I forgot... I passed the 1/3 of the way to Katahdin sign today. No surprise there since that was my design for the hike: to do the middle third.
The trail leaves the Roanoke A.T.C. jurisdiction and enters the Natural Bridge A.T.C.'s. It quickly comes up to the Blue Ridge Parkway which is a scenic route through these mountains. The trail pretty much parallels the road this afternoon and tomorrow. There were some nice wide open vistas with dramatic views at the turnoffs. There's not much water on the parkway except at the shelter I am staying at tonight, a nice boxed spring which is a concrete box that sits around a spring with a pipe out the side for the water. Best water source ever!","Daleville

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662201,"I woke up in the middle of the night and went outside. The night was clear and the stars shone like individual suns on a pitch black background. I couldn't make out constellations; trees obscured much of the background.I got an early start today and pushed pretty hard to make it to two shelters down the line. The weather report predicted a bad thunderstorm between 2 and 4. The storm hasn't materialized yet.Today started out on the trail along Blue Ridge Parkway again. There are pulloffs and at these pulloffs there are trash barrels. Thank goodness. Your trash gets pretty stinky after you carry it around for a couple of days. It was great to unload it. The trail eventually descended off of the parkway onto a ridge with azaleas and other flowers in bloom and stunted oak. What I have been seeing is predominantly oak and when I say ""predominantly"" I mean that's pretty much all there is. There may be a dogwood in the understory or birch or maple no more than 10 feet tall, but any tree of significant stature is an oak. There are acorns everywhere. This was to change later in the day when I ran into a grove of statuesque maple and then at the end, a glen of tall white pine with an understory of club moss.
One highlight of the day was running into the singing sisters. These women are day hiking sections, parking a car at each of two trailheads in the morning then walking between. When they meet a hiker, they sing their ""hello"" song in harmony. What a fun idea! I had heard of them from other hikers so I knew immediately it was them. I hope they don't get caught in the rain. If they parked where I think they parked, it will be a short section for them.I am spending the night at a double decker shelter. It is somewhat famous down here for being so large. I don't have the heart to tell them that Stratton Pond Shelter in Vermont is bigger.
I forgot... Reptile roll call. Lots of sand-colored lizards and one garter snake black-gray with yellow racing stripes.","Bobbets Gap shelter

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662225,"I may be starting to get the hiker hunger. I had two dreams last night. The first one, a number of women on roller skates with pink wheels wearing elf hats came by singing songs carrying plates of festive cookies. Obviously the Singing Sisters if I have to draw a reference. The second dream, a mini fridge with two kinds of broccoli inside.It never rained yesterday afternoon, but it poured last night. I had the shelter all to myself. That has its advantages, you get to call Hiker's Midnight and don't disturb anyone if you wake up early. Anyway, the storm must have been followed by a cold front because the morning was brisk. Be bold, start cold is the advice I have been given and I did. I had so much energy! Today would be a long climb of several thousand feet to the top of a 4000 footer and it felt easy the whole way.I spent the day leapfrogging with two thru hikers, Hellmann's and Cookie. Easy to remember if you visualize an Oreo with mayo in the middle. Cookie's parents did the whole AT in 2021. They say they are a vanguard of perhaps 20 hikers who are travelling in a pack. The rest zeroed at Daleville and are maybe a day behind me.Plants. There were a lot of wildflowers today, most notably a little pink trumpet shaped one. There are also strings of heart-shapes flowers, maybe four to a string. In this one section of the forest, the whole understory was full of nothing but them, very dramatic. I have forgotten every day to mention the mayapples. We don't get these up north. They are about four inches high and have droopy oak-like leaves. They too can dominate the understory. There have been a lot of overlooks today and downhill, the oaks, maples and birches are leafing out. The color of them is emerald, again, makes the heart sing because spring is here. Did I say yet that I am happy out here?The climb today was apple orchard mountain. There is a radar dome at the top. My wife Kate sent me an article about it and it used to be part of a military installation but now tracks commercial traffic. It is grassy at the top and you can easily imagine the time when it was an apple orchard.So I am at a stealth site for the night, actually it looks to be a well-used dispersed camping site. I have a feeling I will be alone again although others are welcome, there is still some room. Tomorrow, I should be in Glasgow VA by early afternoon so socializing may have to wait until then.","Bryant gap shelter

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662296,"I woke up late today, it was already starting to get light outside, the predawn gloaming. Last night was cold in a good way, good sleeping weather if you have the clothes and the sleeping bag for it and in the morning, there was a cloudless orange sky to the East, the peak of a pyramidal mountain interrupting it. The sun rose brightly as I prepared breakfast. Once again, I am alone at a campsite.
Today, hikingwise at least, is a short day into town and mostly downhill to boot. It was cold starting out. I slept with my Sawyer filter last night just in case it went below freezing. If that happens, the fibers inside will be broken by the ice crystals and it will let everything through. I wore my hoodie and long sleeve shirt but quickly ditched the hoodie when I felt myself starting to sweat.
The trail enters the James River wilderness about eight miles from Glasgow. There's a sign there telling you that you are forbidden from jumping off of the James River footbridge. Now they wouldn't have put that sign there if people weren't doing it and they wouldn't have put that sign eight miles away if it were more than one or two that took the leap. It is practically an advertisement. It puts the idea in your head and there it sits. I will tell you later if I did or did not jump off the bridge.
So, the deal with Stanimal's hostel is that it is first come first served and that you call them at exactly five miles from the trailhead. Any sooner and they will ignore you, any later and you will have no cell signal. So I walked through the woods, checking my phone periodically to see how far I was along. The trail here in Virginia is almost always dirt pack or dirt mixed with pebbles, no roots or rocks, so the trip down, on a narrow winding path was easy. I reached the five mile mark and texted the driver, he texted me back telling me that I had three hikers that were just a little ahead of me. It turned out they were Cookie, Hellman's, and OG. I met them as they were filling up on water a little way down the trail. Later, I asked OG if he was older than 65 and when he said ""no"" I said I was going to steal his trail name from him (OG = old gangster mom and dad).So, more flowers. We went past a brook. At least I say it was a brook. Down here, a brook is a creek. Different language. Anyway, the brook was lined with small purple iris, lots of them. I also saw my first rhododendron in bloom. That is a big deal. One of the things the AT is famous for is the green tunnel and the epitome of the green tunnel are the rhododendrons. They form deep thickets, maybe 10 feet high and often the trail is cut right through the heart of them. So, green tunnel.You leave the brook and there is the James River. We were able to see it from above as we hiked down. It looks to be one of those wild rivers, with rocky rapids and stretches of placid water outside of human control (but it looked like there was a dam below the section we traversed). So, a walk, perhaps a mile along it on flat trail with people walking their dogs going in the other direction. Then the James Footbridge, a handsome steel structure with a wooden footpath.I did not jump.I caught up with Cookie, Hellman's and OG at the trailhead, we sat a while, waiting for the shuttle, then got taken to town. Our shuttle driver, Charlie, had a Red Sox mug for his coffee, he was from Danvers which is about 15 miles from Arlington where I live. He gave us a tour of Glasgow, it lasted about 20 seconds because there are only two stores and the diner here. Stanimal's is an old house, just fine and comfy with sleeping space for about 15. I am out here on the porch listening to the birds while I type this. All you can eat spaghetti tonight, I am not yet up for the challenge though. Salad and a sandwich and fries I think.","Stealth site at mile 775

I am here with Kamakazi, Wolfy, Odin and others. I have to admit, I am a little tuckered out but I am in good position for making it to town four days from now.
If you read my journal last year, you might have read the drill. There is a relentless climb of the shoulder of the mountain, then you are on the ridge and from there climb whatever peaks present themselves. There were great views of the James River from the top of Little Rocky Row and from the top of Bluff mountain, a view of the valley below and mountains beyond. Bluff mountain has a story and maybe you can look up the details on the Internet. A child, just short of five years old wandered off from their house and walked seven miles to the top of Bluff mountain and was found dead there. There is a monument to it at the spot they were found.The second half of the day was a relatively easy cruise, but a long one. Two flowers were prominently in bloom today, a stellate flower with five white petals tinged with purple and pink and another stellate flower with ten white petals. They covered the whole understory in places.So pushing it, I did not pay as much attention to my surroundings and still I saw oak and pine growing to heights of a hundred feet and a dammed lake that took on the contours of the land around it. At mile 17, I passed the sweetest campsite by a brook but it was a stealth. The campsite here is also by a brook and I tented down there and am up at the shelter now waiting for my food to cook.","Glasgow

It is funny how dreams are a mash up of what happened the day before. I must have had that child on Bluff Mountain on my mind.The through hikers have two and a half plans. There are the ones who want to be in Waynesboro on Saturday in time to get to the post office before it closes. A second group has this plan that involves a brewery and being in Waynesboro by Saturday. Then there are myself, Odin, Pigpen and Bad Bat who will be in Waynesboro on Sunday. I think the post office is just an excuse, they are the fast ones and we are the slow ones.So, a fifteen mile day, not so tough except that it seems like we are going against the grain. Instead of following the ridges, we have to go up and down them and there were three today. The first landed me on top of Bald knob. My navigation app says ""Walk across the wooded summit of Bald Knob"". In other words, not bald. The next one was Cole Mountain. Was it ever a bald! There was a meadow on top with views in every direction.The third ridge was nothing special, but afterwards, my first trail magic. A couple, ""Happily"" and ""Ever After"" had just finished their thru hike. They'd missed a section and needed to finish it by the anniversary of their start date in order for it to be a thru hike.They were there in a pickup truck with a table and camp chairs with one of their tramily, Fuzz. I had an avocado sandwich with hummus a ginger ale, a bag of chips and a tangerine. Nice! Kind people.I try to keep this light, but there is something that kind of got to me today. The campsite I stayed at last night was originally a black sharecropping community. The National Park Service took their land by eminent domain, probably giving the sharecroppers nothing for the land they improved - the money surely went to the landlord. It is tough to stay on land that was stolen from them and this kind of dispossession of the wealth of Black people is a shameful and ongoing part of our history.","Brown mountain creek shelter

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662495,"Today was The Priest, the last 4000 footer until Mt. Moosilauke in New Hampshire unless you go up the blue blaze trail to the top of Killington. The Priest is also the name of a shelter and in that shelter is a log book. Since it is called, The Priest, you are supposed to confess your sins, the format is ""Father forgive me for I have sinned"" followed by your confession. Most of them seem to revolve around petty or accidental theft. The most common one is that people have stolen toilet paper at the hostels. Speaking of toilet paper, the second category deals with bathroom infractions and I won't repeat them because my parents are reading this.
So the day was easy, if hot. We started pretty high up, beyond where the oaks are leafing out so the sun comes straight through with no shade but for the thickets of mountain laurel which are dark and dense. I passed by what must have been an orchard. There was an apple tree in bloom and what I am hoping are raspberry. I am starting to see ferns in the understory, little delicate things now, but soon they will take over the forest floor.
I have been travelling with Pigpen, Odin and Bad Bat. We leapfrog each other and stop in the same places. The first stop was the Priest shelter where we got water and ate snacks together, then we spread out to go up and over the Priest. Most of the work was getting to the shelter, then from the Priest, it is a long way down. There are two overlooks to the East with mostly farmland below. Maybe we are at the Eastern edge of the range, it seems like we have been walking largely in that direction.So we descended to a brook and by that time we were below the level where the trees are leafing out. There was a breeze, the cascades of water and the shade. Tomorrow, there will be rain and maybe I am looking forward to something besides direct sun. At the bottom of the hill, a 2013 thru hiker, Bubblegum, was handing out trail magic. I had a Gatorade which was very welcome. From there it was a two mile hike uphill to the shelter where we are staying tonight, next to a cool brook and, despite the climb up, we are shaded by maple, birch I think and some oak.

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662521,"Today was a pretty dramatic day. First of all, I have lost all my friends. Pigpen did a few extra miles yesterday. She has a plane to catch in 19 days in Harrisburg Pa to get to her graduation so she has to book it. Odin left early in the morning and has outdistanced me. Bad Bat went to a trailhead to meet her husband and will probably remain behind me.
So, the weather report showed a heavy storm that would hit us between 10 and 11, taper off and last all day and I had 18 miles to do. Bad Bat had a plan to wake up early, get to the first shelter and stay there until the worst of the storm came through. I piggybacked on that and we made it over Bee Mountain and down into the shelter in time. There were views off of ledges on the way up Bee Mountain. I could see that the cloud ceiling was below the peak of the Priest. As I ascended, the cloud ceiling descended and I was in fog with maybe tens of yards of visibility. There were intermittent showers as if I was just running into the rain that was in the clouds rather than it descending.It was kind of funny, when we got to the shelter, there were about five men in their fifties, clean shaven or not so dirty, sitting around chatting. It turns out, they take a little hike, set up their tents and party in the woods all weekend. Well, that's fine, they really didn't seem the type and they went to their tents before the rain hit. Two section hikers came in wet out of the rain. One of them is doing sections with a car camper and he gets shuttles back to his camper every night and stays there. He just has a day pack.So after an hour, the worst blew through and there were only light showers. I don't mind walking in that. The rain is cooling and you can manage your temperature. It's pretty, the green forest in the diffuse light. Eventually the showers ended and I wended my way just below the ridge. I think the Blue Ridge Parkway was up on the ridge. I heard the cars. I reached a ledge with a spectacular view west over farmlands below. There were many day hikers there and I found out why after walking perhaps 300 yards. There is a place to park your car. Talk about best view for least effort! Good for them though.The last part of the day was the climb up and down humpback mountain. There is a ledge at a false peak and I could see clouds to the west approaching. If weather could have emotion, these clouds would be malevolent. Totally black, with a squall line below them. Luckily, no flashes of light ing. To be safe, I headed for a saddle before the main peak and waited for the storm to pass. I was surprised. There wasn't much rain and the sun appeared afterwards. I headed downhill on an easy winding path to the unofficial campsite where it looks like I will spend the night alone.Easy nine mile day tomorrow into Waynesboro.","Harpers Creek shelter

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662573,"This morning, I was at my campsite. There were azaleas in bloom and two old oak trees. One of the first things I do is fix breakfast and as I did, five deer happened by. Now last night, I heard little feet kicking up the rocks in camp. I was hoping it was not a bear. Most likely it was these guys. The largest one, a female, faced me while the smaller ones, possibly her children, grazed on leaves behind her. She'd take a bite, look at me and chew, then take another bite. I was doing the same. She was not more than 10 yards away from me. This went on for quite a while. I savor my breakfast. It was sweet of her to trust my good intentions.
Just a short note about the mayapples. Now each of them has one flower on a stem between the two leaf stems of the plant. I don't know if I will ever see the fruit, though.
I really didn't need to travel far to get into Waynesboro. It was a nine mile walk, only the morning and mostly downhill. I have been walking on flattish rocks the last few days. I hesitate to call them slate, but they do have that blue color. I have seen them used to build a wall in the woods and the chimney and foundation that is all that remains of a house that is no longer there. I also passed the Lowe Family Cemetery where the same stone, unhewn formed the markers, the names of the dead scratched onto the stone. There were also daffodils, come and gone as well, blooms now brown. How nice to be buried in the woods.
So off the trail, down into town. I bought two pair of injinji sock liners, a tactical error to only carry a single pair, then off to the Quality Inn for a shower. Beyond Burger at the River (yum!). Laundry and resupply. Apparently the wayside stores in the Shenandoahs have opened, so I am going to bring four days of food and resupply as I go, not so bad.","Stealth site at mile 855

There are no Uber drivers in Waynesboro and the taxi service has a one star Yelp rating, so I texted Kevin off the list. He picked me up in his pick up truck with his dog in the way back. He is retired. I suggested that being a trail angel might be his hobby and he kind of agreed. In any case someone driving to pick up a stranger and drive them several miles is quite the act of charity.It was cold today. Many of the plants had done what they could to protect themselves from frost, draining the water from their leaves causing them to droop. I like the cold and with the exertion, I was   down to a t shirt soon after starting. The first thing you do in the Shenandoahs is to fill out a hang tag for your pack. You can do this online, but I did not, so I have no idea what you do in lieu of wearing the hang tag. There are two climbs straight off to peaks with telecom equipment on them. The second peak also had tractor seats on poles stuck in the ground for hikers to sit on. It is not quite meadow there, or maybe it once was. It's like the land has never decided what it wants to become, vines and brambles are all over the place.
There is that kid's song:The bear climbed over the mountainThe bear climbed over the mountainThe bear climbed over the mountainTo see what he could seeTo see what he could seeHe saw another mountainHe saw another mountain He saw another mountainSo the bear climbed over the mountain(Ad nauseum)It's a song that can be used to drive parents crazy with the repetition and today was much like that. At least there were switchbacks, but I went over about eight peaks today, the last six viewless in the trees. Oh well, you can take Skyline drive instead and spend times at all those overlooks. There were some beautiful elements of forest: small birch trees newly leafed out forming a low canopy over me, lots of azaleas in bloom and every plant on the forest floor has grown a new set of leaves since yesterday (except for the mayapples whose leaves just get bigger).

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662691,"Last night, I was camped out on a rocky tent site and I feared that I would have a restless sleep. Boy was I wrong! I put my head down at 7:30 (my hiker midnight) and went out instantly I woke up at 2:00 having dreamt that I was at a BTS concerte. I know nothing of their music, luckily my dream music was Sufjan Stevens ""Words are futile devices"" from the  Call Me by Your Name soundtrack, a beautiful song and perfectly reproduced inside my dream. I fell easily back to sleep and woke up refreshed at 5:30. Part of it might have been the exhaustion of a long day but the other part was the cold temperature (I slept with my Sawyer to keep it from freezing) combined with being zipped completely into my warm sleeping bag with my puffy jacket on.Onto the day. I couldn't be more wrong about the views if you read my post yesterday. The views today were spectacular and many. The first was at Black rock Mountain which has at its peak a jumble  of dark grey squarish boulder piled haphazardly somewhat like Mt. Madison or Adams in the Whites. It was a half hour after sunrise, the shadows and light of the soft early morning light starkly defined the shape of the mountains.I saw more very tame deer, two that came almost close enough to touch and a larger group grazing on grass. I guess without hunters in a national park, they have nothing to fear. I reunited with Odin who Ilike a lot. He is constantly cheerful, I think the result of 900 miles of quietude out here. I did pass the 900 mile marker today. I also saw OG again, but he has gone ahead.I am staying here tonight with Big Dog, Fearless, Hero, Truck and Blaze.

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662772,"I spent yesterday evening with Fearless, Hero and Big Dog, talking mostly to Fearless. She has MS whose main symptom is the demyelination of the axons in the brain. In my former life, I worked imaging human and mouse brains, so I am a bit familiar with the subject. It's as if you have a jumble of wires and remove the plastic shielding from them, worse than that really because the shielding around the axons helps keep a strong long-distance signal in them. Anyway, she is giving it a go - MS isn't who she completely is and she has strength and endurance that will serve her well.Today is a bit of an experiment. I am taking a trail Nero (nero=near zero) of only 13 miles with a 22 mile day planned for tomorrow. I took today extremely slowly and that was enjoyable and maybe some of the hurting parts of me will be thankful for that.I learned the name of my favorite flower out here: the trillium. It is called that because it has three dark green leaves and three petals to its flower. I don't believe I have ever seen one up North but here, they are everywhere. There is even one sitting beside me now as I type this. Anyway, the day started out climbing Hightop and on the other side, the understory was filled with them. They have slightly different colors ranging from pure white to pink to a pastel purple hue. There were some views on the ridges descending Hightop, but most of the day was a leisurely and mostly flat walk through the forest. When you get on high, you can see the patterns of the trees leafing out. I think below it is mostly maple which are now a dark green and on top, the oaks have leafed out a little or at the very top, still not at all or just buds. There are a lot of small birch and these guys have leafed out although only the small plants have branches where the deer could eat them. I think the first six feet of everything is bare because of the deer which makes it easy to see longish distances across the forest floor.So, the logistical challenge of the day was to resupply at Lewis Campground. The camp store is open, but the choices were so slim! They had a display of Mountain House dehydrated meals which for me is disappointing because they are very meat forward and not imaginative. They had one soy ramen and some chicken and beef ones (I got one chicken but won't use it's flavor packet). Very few breakfast choices (pancake mix - could I make that work?) Lots of bars and chips and candy and wine and beer. Oh well, I have enough calories to eat but will be so grateful to see my son, Daniel and daughter in law, Nadia in a few days.I spend a lot of time in solitude and it gives me time to work things out in my head. I am working on a novel, don't know what it will amount to, but today I spent some time working out a crucial part. I think writing a work of fiction can be a puzzle. There is a straight line through, but you have to weave threads so that a bit in the beginning prepares the reader for what is ahead. It is kind of like hiking this trail, no?By the way, the other plant we don't have up North is the hickory. The husks of its nuts, split into quarters are everywhere.","Hightop Shelter
",Bearface Shelter,"Apr 26, Wed",13
Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662801,"Today might be a short one because I did a long day. I got up early this morning and was on trail before dawn. This section of the trail skirts the western side of the mountains and because of that, there were great views into the Shenandoah Valley. At one point, I could see a farm way down below me and perhaps a mile or two away and I could hear the roosters crowing down there.
The trail maintainers have done quite a job here. There are two features in particular I will mention. The first is the signage. There are a lot of side trails and short paths to Skyline Drive and these would normally cause confusion, except for the signposts. These are three foot long concrete posts. They must weigh 100 pounds each. I have no idea how they got them into the back country. They also have the best label maker ever. It embosses trail directions on a one inch wide tin strip which is woven into a groove in the post. So you get clear directions at each junction where the AT goes, you get mileage markers to everywhere and you find out about the turnoffs and overlooks.
The second is the way they have hardened the trail. As a trail winds its way along a slope, the downward side erodes. Here, they build stone buttresses on the downhill side which prevents the erosion and leaves a flat, if rocky surface.
Today, I also passed the two lodges. The first, Big Meadows is as its name indicates, a grassy meadow under oak trees. The lodge's rooms face out west, having a beautiful view of the valley. The second is the Skyline Lodge which has horses to ride. The trail north of Skyline Lodge is pretty easy and within one mile there is a dramatic view from the top of a cliff.","Bearface Shelter
",Byrd's Nest,"Apr 27, Thu",22
Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662874,"Today's synopsis, to give away the punchline, is that I am double zeroing at my son's and daughter-in-law who live close by.
The forecast was for rain, starting in the night, so last night I bedded down in the Byrd's Nest Shelter to stay warm and dry. They have a fireplace there and the section hikers there built a roaring fire. So we started off the evening toasty warm, but as the night wore on, the rain started and the wind was blowing a bit of the rain into the shelter, not enough to get us wet, but enough so that my backpack, which was hanging on a hook at the shelter's entrance would get wet. So I took it off the hook and put it on the floor. Rookie mistake! In the middle of the night, I hear little scratching noises. Now mind you, I am very careful not to leave anything remotely edible in my pack. But perhaps my notion of edible...? Anyway, when I woke up, I found that the shock cord that holds my  sleeping pad to my backpack had a small piece chewed off of it, the zipper on the left pocket of my pack belt had been chewed off and two holes had been chewed in the pack's top in a futile attempt to eat my reading glasses that were stored there. Go figure! All flesh wounds although my pack is so beat up at this point that I will get a new one for the next hike.So out into the rain. It was really pouring! I had been cursing bringing my winter wool cap and gloves with me but today, I put them on. Warm head! Warm hands! So glad I had them. Walking keeps you warm, even while wet and I did the first ten miles to Elkwallow Wayside in record time. The wayside sells little trinkets and such, but also a lot of hiker supplies. You can get isobutane fuel, ramen and Snickers bars, so it is pretty much one stop shopping. I go to get inside and there in the window of the store was Odin. He was dry too! It turns out he slept in an alcove near the bathrooms in the parking lot. Likely not an authorized use, but he got away with it. He was waiting for a ride from a friend who he called to bail him out of the rain. I told him, well my son lives even closer than your friend and he asked me the fateful question, ""Why don't you call him up and get to sleep someplace dry tonight?"" The more I thought about it, the better the idea sounded. I do have dry clothes and a dry sleeping bag in my dry bag, but... So I am eating my snacks and looking out the window of the wayside and River and Stickers show up. They are from the younger set, strong hikers but also just nice people. They heard that Odin was bailing and began to talk about the possibility themselves. Eventually, we all talked each other into bailing and I called Daniel and Nadia and they came and got me.Standing still, the chill began to seep into me. I got to their house, jumped straight into the shower with the warm water quickly restoring me. They fed me dinner and I am in their warm house, in clean cotton clothes so comfortable.The rain will extend through Sunday and I am on no schedule, so I will take a double zero and go back out on Monday, you will hear from me again","Byrd's Nest

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663018,"I left Daniel and Nadia's (my son and daughter in law) this morning. Nadia fed me tortellini and tacos and we had Chinese food the other night. They offered me so much comfort, it was two days just sitting on the couch with the two of them and maybe one of the cats too. Quite a change from the trail, they were so kind and it was restorative.
I had arranged for a shuttle to take me back to Elkwallow Wayside. My driver (I never did get her name) was one of those people that you correct with at a telepathic level, a kindred soul. At one point, she looks at the landscape and says, ""I like the way the morning light brings out the contours of the mountains"" which you have heard from me. She says that the squirrels hang out on the road to lick the salt off of it. It was an enjoyable, if long, ride. There is the monetary aspect to it, but it felt more like she was doing something nice for me.
So off to Elkwallow. You are going out of the Shenandoahs so it is mostly downhill. It was a very easy day with some views into the valley on an overcast day. Often, a break in the clouds would shine a beam of light on some part of the landscape that you otherwise wouldn't have paid attention to. The last overlook of the day was at a point where I think I should have been able to see Daniel and Nadia's house. I will be closer to them tomorrow.I spent some time trying to parse the forest floor. Now that spring is here in full force, I am seeing how things fill in. Almost all the plants are deciduous, either woody or not. There are some areas where it looks like ferns dominate, but they are sparse and unpredictable. The small flowers are being overshadowed by more leafy plants. Small birch, oak and maple complete the understory picture. There are moss, but so far, most of them have the indecisive yellow-green color rather than emerald or dark green of the ones that have committed to try and flourish.
Speaking of oak, they are finally leafing out everywhere. The leaves are still yellowish, small and shriveled. I am rooting for the oaks to get their full leaves in time for the tannins in them to give them some protection from the gypsy moth caterpillars.
So, I was planning to stay at the Tom Floyd shelter, but I was already there by 3:00 and that felt too early to stop. I saw that the Mountain Home B&B was right on the trail, maybe two hours ahead and on a whim, I called them up. They had room for me in one of the communal rooms, so I was able to put in some extra miles and as a bonus, sleep indoors for the fourth night in a row. Am I cheating?","Daniel and Nadia's

It was just flurries and it melted as soon as it hit the ground, but nonetheless, snow in May. Just in case you are afraid that I am freezing, I hiked most of the day in a t-shirt.The second thing is that after being on that slate-like rock since Waynesboro, the rock underfoot changed twice. The first was to a brownish possibly sandstone and the second, according to a park sign is basalt. It is black and green and smooth with very few cracks or sharp edges. Interesting. Basalt is volcanic. It has been a while (many hundreds of millions of years) since there were active volcanoes on the east coast.So, last night, I went to dinner with some of the people who were staying at the B&B. One of them is a flip flopper, the other two just finished up the Shenandoahs. It was one of those $20 entree places, not fancy, but the bill adds up and more importantly, the calories don't. The portions were more than enough for the average adult, but a thru hiker? I thought...$30, that could buy maybe 1500 calories of food at McDonalds? 2000? 3000? There is a chart somewhere in hikerland of calories per dollar at McDonalds, I remember seeing it.Then, well the owners of the B&B served me a very nice breakfast and told me the history of the house. It is on rte 522 which was a road back then too and the Union soldiers stopped at the house and took all their food. Food again, a theme today? Anyway, as nice a breakfast as it was, there were only two pieces of French toast. Now again, enough for a regular person, but... I was kind of crying inside. I needed at least four more.
So enough about food. The day was overcast with intermittent showers, in the 50's. Actually good hiking weather. The trail goes to the east and up and the forest is mostly silver maple, huge 100 foot trees leafing out only near the canopy. The forest floor was green and lush. At one point it was blanketed with Trilliums. They are almost done, some of the petals are broken or withered but beautiful nonetheless. The trail follows the ridge, level dirt or pebbles, very easy walking, then it descends to Manassas Gap where you go under interstate 81.. You can hear the whine of the 18 wheelers' tires from miles in either direction. Then you ascend the western ridge and continue. I was hoping to see Daniel and Nadia's house from the ridge but there were no views today. I was deep in the forest.Anyway, the trail next crosses route 50 which is a busy 55 MPH highway between Winchester Va and Washington. I was dreading it, but the AT crosses it at a place where there is a knoll between the east and westbound sides and there are long views in both directions. It just took a bit of patience to find a break in traffic. I could have easily sauntered across but of course I ran.
I am staying tonight at an undeveloped campsite by a brook, very nice, right now snug and warm in my tent in a light rain. I had a Ramen Bomb for dinner: instant mashed potatoes, ramen, olive oil and a tuna packet. Well over 1000 calories. I am a happy boy.","Mountain Home B &B

The tall trees I have been calling silver maple are not.I started the day by the brook. A Hermit Thrush woke me up. He sang his song and then improvised a minor variation on it. Amazing bird. My tent was wet outside but everything inside was dry. The rain has stopped during the night. Today would be overcast or partly cloudy but there would not be any rain. As I started hiking, I ran into that bane of rainy nights: the car wash. The shrubs at the sides of the trail lean in wetly and you get kind of soaked. You can ward them off with trekking poles which I did successfully.
The mystery of the morning were these green and orange petals (or bracts or whatever a botanist would call them). The pattern on them was striking, but no matter how hard I looked, I could not find the tree or plant that they belonged to. Three women with Southern accents happened by,. I explained that I was not from around here and I asked what they were. They had the same question. So it continued to bedevil me until I found the flower whole, attached to the branch with leaves of the ""silver maple"" also attached. Now, maples have tiny yellow flowers that beget whirligigs, so this was definitely not a maple. I took a picture of it with my plant app which solved the problem. It is a tulip tree which does grow to incredible height.I soin reached a sign that said I was entering the rollercoaster. I had heard of it and thought, well the whole AT is a rollercoaster, how hard can it be? So I w.ent up the first hump and down the first hump, crossed a brook and then up the second. By the fourth brook and fifth hump, I figured I would be writing you that there are six or so.There are 12 humps, quite a strenuous trek.

In any case, if you hear the Hermit Thrushes singing the guitar riff from it, that is on me.
So it rained last night and I was in a cabin sponsored by the Potomac ATC. The caretaker came in late. He asked me if I wanted a soda or hot cocoa but I had brushed my teeth. Then he proceeded to start a fire in the cabin's wood stove. What luxury!!!
The trail went along the ridge, very easy walking, a gradual downhill to Harper's ferry which is up on a promontory above the Shenandoah and Potomac. I made good time and was there by noon. Coming in, the NAACP has a plaque honoring John Brown and his band and the millions of Union soldiers and freedom slaves who fought for justice. It was very moving for me.
There is a bus that goes to Walmart, maybe five miles away, so I took that for an easy resupply. Lots of snacks, fresh fruit (Instantly consumed) and the usual suspects.I then went to the ATC office to get my hang tag and get my picture taken. Harper's Ferry isn't as busy an office as Munson Maine or Springer Georgia, so I was #113, I think. I could see in the book who came through when. Pigpen is long gone, four days ahead of me.

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663260,"Maryland might be the smallest section but it is packed full of surprises, some of which I will relate. Dawn is coming about a half hour earlier than when I started. The sun was just starting to rise as I packed up my tent and I was on the road before 7:00. Maryland is the flattest state. There are hills (3400 feet of ascent in 20 miles) but they are gradual and often swichbacked. Much of the day was walking on ridges on soft, manicured, often wide trails. There weren't many views but the ones there were were spectacular, into the wide valley below the ridge to the west.I am definitely moving north and a combination of it being later in spring and the difference in plants here has changed the forest floor. On one side of the trail today, the mayapples blanketed the ground, on the other, delicate ferns were taking over, clearly to cover the entire understory, but not quite there yet. I saw a lady slipper and one mountain Laurel that had almost bloomed. All of that new.One surprise is the way the trail has been routed through historical areas. We walked through Crampton and Fox gaps. In September of 1862, general Lee marched North after a victory at Manassas to directly challenge the Union troops. He planned to break his army into five sections and secure them strategically to give him an advantage when the Union troops arrived. However, a copy of the plans fell into Gen McClellan's hands and the Union was able to win the battles. At Fox Gap, both a Confederate and Union general died on the battlefield. I have to say, I feel a sense of rage that the Confederates could have believed their cause righteous, the whole gentility thing being based on the stolen labor and brutality of slavery just below the surface. Sorry, that is just my perspective. Anyway, there are monuments and the whole thing is very moving. Another surprise (I actually knew about) is Washington's monument, the first one, not the one in the capitol. It is a round stone structure about thirty feet tall with a winding staircase in its middle. The best view of the day is from the top.Another surprise awaited me at lunchtime. Now normally, I find a log somewhere to sit on to eat, invariably somewhat rotten and wet. I can't wash my hands before eating. Invariably, they are dirty. So I was walking and I saw through the woods some picnic tables. Much nicer than a rotten log to sit on. Getting up there, I saw there was a bathroom. So I go in the bathroom and there is a big trash barrel. I have so much trash I have to pack out and after several days, it can get pretty disgusting. So great, I get to throw away my trash. I go to wash my hands, of course there is soap in the soap dispenser. I turn around... There are shower stalls with shampoo in them and there is both a hot and cold water faucet. I turn on the hot one and hot water comes out! So, no towels, oh well, I just took a shower (so much salt in my hair I could taste it as the water came down) and put on some quick dry nylon shorts. Let me tell you, I am a happy boy. Caps who I am travelling with says that Maryland is his favorite state.One last thing, there is a lot of marble up here.

I am staying at the Zero Day hostel which is a great place (hint, the rooms are doubles, so come in with a friend). Hoodie, the owner, opened it five days ago. I heard about it from word of mouth. More about my stay later.
The day started once again at dawn. The tent sites at the Pogo campground are very spread out. Somehow they found dirt to pad the floor, the rest is this silvery flat rock that is all over this part of Maryland. Rock is a theme today. Sometimes the trail was soft and flat, others very rocky. Nobody said anything about rocks in Maryland.
So there is this thing about rocks and ridges. Often, you will be walking on a ridge, especially here in Maryland and you are not quite at the top. You think, ""If I were only 100 feet to the right, there would be such a great view. I am just below the top and can't see anything (the trees have fully leafed out now and you couldn't see, even if you were up there, unless you were at a cliff edge). The truth of it is that the absolute top is almost always impossibly rocky. There is nowhere for what soil that accumulates to go but down when it rains, so the rocks are washed clean and are bare and jagged up there. Sometimes you will pass from ridge to ridge and have to climb over that area. OUCH!
Speaking of rocks, the best view of the day was at High Rock. Let me tell you, if something has ""High"" in its name, it is going to be party central. There is spray paint over everything for half a mile around. Somebody even spray painted a mountain laurel blue. I suppose it seemed a good idea to whoever did it at the time after sharing a fifth of Cossack Vodka with a friend. The rocks from a cliffy promontory with a view west over the valley to other mountains maybe thirty to fifty miles beyond.
So the hostel. I am staying here tonight with Boston and an OG who is not the OG I was travelling with before, Taster's Choice, and some others. Hoodie drove us to Applebee's and Walmart in his vintage Plymouth station wagon. It had seats facing the wrong way in the way back. Applebee's has an impossible burger which was mind blowing and we all got a chance to compare trail food recipes. I haven't told you but I have upped my snack game. Four snacks a day = 1000 extra calories plus about 750 at lunch. It's insane, carbs to carbon dioxide and water makes the fuel that runs my little engine. I think I will end it there today.

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663376,"Well, first day in Pennsylvania and it was an easy one. I set a minimum goal of 15 miles, a reasonable goal of 18 miles and a stretch goal of 21 miles. I am at the stretch goal and it is only 4:00. I am stopping anyway.The day started at the Zero Day Hostel. Hoodie made me waffles for breakfast and I was off by 6:30. By 6:45, I had crossed the Mason/Dixon line into Pennsylvania. It is close to my halfway point on this section I am doing and also pretty close to the halfway point of finishing it all.
So as I said, easy peasy. Most of what I did was flat and most of it was dirt pack trail, soft on the feet. Most of it, more on that later. Anyway, having the luxury of easy trail, I spent a lot of time looking at the forest. Most of the big trees were oaks, but the forest floor was pretty densely covered by white pine, balsam fir and hemlock. You could see some mother trees, big pines competing with the oak but rare. I think this might be new forest. The oaks come first, growing in the easy daylight of an overgrown meadow. They form a uniform canopy which unfortunately block out the light of their children. The second generation are the conifers and that is the apex forest. I know that is the way it is in Massachusetts. All the old growth was white pine.So, yesterday, I wrote about why the trail never runs along the top of the ridge. Today, I thought I would document it with pictures, dramatic photos of giant jumbled boulders. Of course, I am hiking along as I did this and I saw a double blaze which signals a turn in the trail. The top baze indicates the direction and it was to the right which was the side that the ridge was on. OK, so the trail is going up and over the ridge and down the other side.
No.
The trail went up on the ridge, amidst those giant purple grey rocks. You did see some nice ones, stacked improbably, but there was a lot of almost scrambling up there. Now, a thru hiker takes about 4,000,000 steps between Georgia and Maine. It's very important that a vanishing fraction of these be ankle twisters or leg breakers because even if it were one step in a thousand, that would still leave 4000 ankle twisting, leg breaking steps to take. It was fun doing that section, but was it a good idea to put the trail up there? I leave that up to you.
I am at the Quarry Gap shelter. It is pretty entertaining, like being at your aunt's house, the quirky one. There are gnomes, pansies, stone turtles and frogs and a bench swing. The spring is engineered so that you can fully fill your water bag just by opening it, deep and cold. It's raining at the moment, but the picnic table is under an awning and my tent is up and dry inside.","Zero day hostel

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663459,"Well, today was a long day, my longest yet. Many milestones too, 400 miles this year, mile 1100 and the halfway point.
Last night it was raining. Conversation had died down and my tent seemed dryer than the shelter, so I said my goodnights and settled myself down. You can't really sit up comfortably, so I laid down. I didn't have anything to rest my head on so I blew up my pillow and used that. It was sliding around and there is a pocket in my sleeping bag that holds it in place. So I set up my sleeping bag. Next, my clothes were salty and wet so I put on my dry sleeping clothes, climbed in the sleeping bag and put my head down. The next thing I knew, it was 3:15 in the morning. My hiker's midnight was something like 6:30.
So I woke up early, maybe 5:15 or 5:30 and before sunrise I was out. I had heard that it was going to be hot (but it was a cool enough day) so an early start made sense. Once again, the trail was easy and the forest was beautiful. The mountain laurel looks like it will bloom within a week. I will send you pictures of walking through tunnels of blossoms when it does.
There was a pine grove of mature trees, dark and cool with only needles and moss covered logs on the forest floor, the trees densely packed together. I also walked through a controlled burn site. They had lit the forest floor on fire, the bark on the trees was scorched, but most of them and all of the pitch pines were still alive.
Now being the halfway point, I would be passing the store that hosts the half gallon challenge. Now, most of us have been gluttons in our lifetime, eating half a pint of Ben and Jerry's right out of the container. This is eight times that. You buy a pint and a two liter size ice cream and try to consume it all. The results are predictably disastrous. Now I am upping my snacks game, so I was looking to buy a pint. I am no fool and only twice the glutton you are.
The thought of that pint occupied me many times during the morning. What flavor to buy, what other snacks to get. There was even a discussion of what flavors to get in the logbook of the shelter prior to the store.
But
When I got there, there was a sign, ""closed on Mondays"". Oh well. Anyway, there was a bulletin board with a leaflet from a hostel in Duncannon. They said that they could order any brand of shoes you wanted and get them in time for you to stop by. I need new shoes. The right one has come delaminated and the toe will come off soon. I also need a new pack after the mouse incident. I can't really blame the mouse, the poor thing was on its last leg anyway. So I called them and booked for two days from now, then asked about the shoes. I was told they don't do that anymore but there is an outfitter in Boiling Springs where I will be tomorrow. So Plan A is to get a pack and shoes tomorrow, plan B is to get shoes there or at a place near Duncannon that I can Uber to and plan C is to hike a few more days and get both at the world's largest Cabela's.
Anyway, after I hung up the phone, I realized Duncannon was 44 miles away. Oh well, that is a stretch and I had to do something to make that possible. Hence the extra miles today. Really, it wasn't so bad, as long as it is mostly flat, I can go forever.","Quarry Gap shelter

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663517,"Last night, I spent some time talking to Robert who is doing a flip-flop north. He is from South Carolina and a hunter. He is really attuned to the habits of animals. He was able to pick out two owls calling to each other and some turkey hens in the woods, among other things. People hone these sorts of skills without realizing they are remarkable, but they are.
Before bedtime, I checked my trail app (Far Out) to see what today would bring. I was surprised to see that there is a stretch through the Cumberland Valley that is 15 miles long and there is no camping anywhere between Boiling Springs and the end of that stretch. It would take a 26 mile day to reach the other side. That would mean walking until around 7:00pm which is certainly possible, but not pleasant. Right at mile 20 (mile 1132 going north) the AT crosses rte 11 and there is a Quality Inn there. It seemed like an uncanny coincidence, 20 miles being my target lately, so I booked myself in.
I started out early as usual. The trail was easy and flat going towards Boiling Springs until it wasn't. You have trails like the Pacific Northwest trail that require you to bushwhack with map and compass and others like the Continental Divide Trail where there are many alternate ways to get from the southern to northern terminus. The AT, however is curated. You follow from blaze to blaze and whatever Appalachian Trail Club that handles the section will lead you to a cliff with a vista or to a shelter by a brook and that is where you go. Well today, the Maryland club sent me on an adventure. One of the clues that you are on an adventure is when, instead of a blaze, you see an arrow. It usually indicates that the trail maintainers want you to do something very particular.
So, the white blazes led up some switchbacks to the top of a ridge (clue #1 that something was up) and between two gigantic boulders, there was the first arrow. It was a tight squeeze. Anyway, they had set me up an interesting path through that mess of boulder giants. There were many arrows. There was even a part that qualified, at least for me, as a scramble where I had to use my hands to hoist myself up onto a rock. At one point, I could see a detour where some hikers had gone off script to take an obvious shortcut. But what is the fun of that? If someone sets you on an adventure, take it.
The rocks are interesting. I saw a conglomerate with small ancient pebbles buried in a grey matrix. The normal rock varies from dark grey to almost white with some having an orange tinge to them. If you put a gun to my head, I would say it's schist, but you would be a fool to believe me.
After the scramble, I could see the town of Boiling Springs below me through the trees and by noon I was there. The trail goes around a pond and in the pond are the fattest geese ever. Not our skinny Canadian Geese, these were white and brown with orange beaks. Wow. Anyway, first order of business was to eat. I went to Caffe 101 which is just off the trail. There was outdoor seating which means I have less chance of offending guests by being in close quarters with them after three days without showers. It looks like the place is popular with the luncheon crowd, think of your mom with her two best friends getting dressed up for their weekly date. And there I am, some animal, wandering in from the woods. I had the veggie quesadilla and a mango smoothie, both really good, but really, it was only 1/2 a quesadilla, a semicircle of deliciousness rather than 360 degrees. Sigh.
TCO outfitters was a disappointment. They don't sell packs and they have two kinds of shoes, Oboz, which I liked until they stopped making them in wide sizes and Saucony. Oh well, onto plan B.
The last eight miles to the hotel were interesting, through still-unplanted cornfields and the sort of interstitial wilderness that you see in the suburbs, a strip sometimes only 100 feet across of weedy untamedness mixed with honeysuckle in bloom, robins, blue jays, cardinals and sparrows. There were two cats and one fox. The trail was flat and dirt. Sometimes I wish the whole thing was like that, mostly at the end of the day.
Good news. The Middlesex Diner next to the hotel serves big portions of perfectly good food and they have lots of desserts too, all for a reasonable price.","James Fry Shelter

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663570,"I'll start today with trigonometry. As I came out of the forest yesterday at Boiling Springs, I could see hills in the distance across the Cumberland Valley. They looked a lot closer than 14 miles away. There is an angle from the horizontal, if you were to survey it, to the top of those mountains. The distance to them forms the base of a triangle and the height of them forms one side. The tangent of the angle from the horizontal times the distance to them is the height of them. So the measure of that angle is worrisome because if it is at all big, there is a lot to climb. I spent much of yesterday and the first two hours today walking to them.
I needn't have worried. It was only a 15 minute climb. I guess it was a small angle. There was a great view of the valley and the trail maintainers have built a nice bench seat out of the rocks nearby.
Frankly, most of the day I spent worrying about replacing my pack and shoes. Both were on their last legs. But the forest was shaded and cool with fairly gentle ups. I went through a field planted with some sort of grass. There were few winged blackbirds singing. When you go through a field, there are no trees which means they have to use posts to put blazes on. I think there was a red winged blackbird on every post.
There are a ton, hundreds of reddish brown millipedes today everywhere.
Before Duncannon, there is a cliff with a view down into the town and of the Susquehanna river next to it, way down below. It is only a mile from there to town, a somewhat perilous mile, many stone steps leading down. It must have been a lot of work, fashioning that descent.
So, onto my pack and shoes dilemma. I saw last night that there was a local REI. This was not plan A,B or C, it was plan R. I arranged a ride there with a shuttle driver, we talked the entire time, again, just a pleasure to have someone take you someplace and chat. REI was fantastic. I brought my pack, intending to convince them to let me try stuffing all my stuff into one pack or another until I found one that was suitable. The staff was into it, clearing a table for the project, offering helpful suggestions. Did I say I liked REI? Anyway, things being what they are, I got an Osprey which is a bit heavier than the Mariposa that failed me, but a comfortable pack. I also got another pair of Keens, but not the ones I was hoping for. Supply chain issues still bedevil everyone and some things just aren't available, but what I have will more than do if a mouse doesn't eat them.
Went to dinner at the Doyle's hotel which is a famous hiker hangout with Tommy who is an older hiker like myself. Curt and Blaze were there as well. That is it for tonight.","Quality Inn Carslile

I am also writing this while eating dinner, not having finished my day, a little experiment. I am next to a small stream and I can fill up on water before going to a dry tent site.
I left Duncannon today on a long road walk that took me over the Susquehanna. The river winds it's way through the hills here, cutting into them deeply, leaving steep inclines in them, not quite cliffs luckily. I left the road and made my way up through switchbacks to high above the town and river. The day would be filled with views down to the Susquehanna and into fields below and mountains across. After the climb, there is a long ridge walk. Improbably, a mountain road makes it's way across the ridge and there is a parking lot. Some kind soul had put their tailgate down with a sign advertising trail magic. I took a Gatorade, some cookies and a stroupwaffel. Nice. Anyway, the spot is popular, even on a weekday and many day hikers walk along the easy path at the top after letting their car do the climbing. There are lots of mayapples and the forest is shady and cool.  Eventually, the ridge ends, you climb down to a road and then go up again.

I got up early and was soon walking on the flat dirt path through dark green mountain laurel and hemlock, so peaceful and cool. The highlight of the day would be the beaver pond. There is a sign before you get there saying ""dry alternative: 1.5 miles"". It is rare that the AT gives you a sanctioned alternative. There are some bad weather paths for when rocks are slippery and wet. Offhand, I can only think of one. What would the fun be in not trying the official route, though?Beaver ponds are one of my favorite things and I have not seen one yet this trip. This is a new one. It has only been several years since the beavers did in the trail. The pond is still new. Dead, waterlogged trees still stand upright in it and the dam is not one of those six foot monsters I have seen. I think the beavers are playing a long game, waiting for the trees to fall before dragging them off to patch the overflows.Anyway, I took off my shoes and put on my sandals and waxed through. Large frogs were jumping out of the way and small creatures were zizzing through the water which was so cold and soothing on my feet. Really, it is not so deep but I did not want to get my waterproof shoes wet.I found coal. It was just sitting there on the ground. I passed the site of an abandoned coal mining town, but no sign of any structures.The trail goes a long way down, under the interstate, then all the way back up again.

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663737,"Today marks a number of milestones for me. I crossed mile 1200. I have finished 500 miles. More importantly, I have less than 200 more to go. I can feel the end and I can feel the tug of everyone back home. In a couple of weeks, more or less, I will be back on Spy Pond with Kate, both of us sitting in our Adirondack chairs. I will be doing mostly nothing, not walking 12 hours a day.
But it was a good walk, on mostly flat, mostly still rock-free trail. Here in Pennsylvania, the forest floor is often blanketed with the young ferns, uncurled but not yet fanned out. Today was overcast with very occasional drizzle. If you know me, that is more than fine, a reasonably cool day in the forest.
I ate lunch today by a brook, a small white and small blue flower keeping me company. I had taken my shoes off and put them in the water. It was so frigid that I could not soak them for a minute, but it felt good. Afterwards, I did trail laundry, taking off my quick dry shirt, rinsing it thoroughly in the brook, wringing it out and wearing it until it dried.
Towards the end of the day, I went through a controlled burn site. This wasn't the first I passed through but it was the largest. I think I walked a mile to cross it. The forest is covered with dry leaves. I imagine they do the burn to consume them and prevent an uncontrolled fire. The large trees seem unaffected. The bark on their trunks is a bit singed. The real winners are the ferns which seem to love the charred soil, their rhizomes protected, being underground, they seemed to flourish. Unfortunately, the losers are the small birches and shrubs such as the mountain laurel which are reduced to red sticks.
I am camping at an unimproved site a bit into the woods. I did pass a shelter, but it was only 4:00 and there was no water at it. So here I am, sleeping tonight, my tent on top of soft dry leaves. That is it for now.

I had to hike to Port Clinton, then resupply, then hike some more to get to the Eckville shelter so I will be good to go to my B&B tomorrow. So once again, I woke up before the birds and was going by sunrise and was in Port Clinton by 9:00. There is a Walmart a mile and a half down a busy road, and when I say ""down"", I mean it was at a much lower elevation which means that once I was down there, the direction back would be ""up"". I had a plan A, a plan B and a plan C. Plan A was to call Steve who is a shuttle driver that will take you. I called Steve, his phone message was that he wasn't doing it today. So onto plan B. Get an Uber (well a Lyft but nobody calls it that). Amazingly, there was somebody in the area, Ashashe, whose specialty is ferrying hikers. Great guy a real lifesaver.
Now there is something that happens when you go into town called the Vortex. You get sucked in. First there is the resupply, then a meal, then maybe some window shopping, then another meal and so on until the day is gone. I could not afford a vortex, so I went to work, throwing my backpack into a shopping cart and going through the aisles. Now let me tell you, everyone at a trail town Walmart has seen it before, a stinky hiker with his backpack in a shopping cart piling it full of candy and ramen. So... Four breakfasts, that is a 20 pack of Quaker oat single servings, four dinners, that is a box of couscous, a knorrs side, two large ramen bowls, a box of stuffing, two packs of mashed potatoes and a bag of cranberries. Snacks, two oranges and a mango smoothie drink. Done. 
I am walking out the door with my purchases and this woman walks up. ""You're a hiker."" I always have time to talk, so I did, then as she went in, she said, ""If you are still here when I get back, I will give you a ride back to the trail. Well, I had a lot of work still to do, so I hurried. There is all that packaging, you have to break it down and get rid of it or you may be carrying it 60 miles. Five packs of Quaker oats into one quart ziplock four times, the same with the other meals, drink the mango drink and there she is coming out of the store. Let me tell you, some people are so nice. She is a hiker and hopes to do some big sections someday. Well anyway, she asks me if there is any other place I want to go.
BIG WIN AT the SNACK GAME
She asked, so I told her. Burger King. Everyone seems to love to hate Burger King, but if you are vegetarian, not. It was 10:58 which will be an important fact. It took us two minutes to get over there and just as we were pulling into the drive up lane, the menu magically changed from breakfast to lunch and there it was. The Impossible Whopper, 670 calories. I asked for two of them. Now 1300 calories is about 2/3 of what you need in a day, but not me. My trail angel drove me back to the trailhead and I ate both of them. Now having not eaten beef for over 45 years, I had long since forgotten what it is like to eat meat roasted over a fire. Let me tell you, I experienced the joy today that our distant ancestors did when one of them dropped that leg of venison into the fire by accident. Indescribable. And there were pickles and mayonnaise too.
Ok 1300 calories snack. It gave me energy all day. Again, the AT is a curated experience and the trail maintainers wanted me to see Pulpit Rock. Let me tell you, it was far from a straight line from here to there to get to it but it was worth it. The view is from the cliff top, through these two rugged hills and into the farmland below. Pictures do not do it justice. There were all these girls in full length dresses, their hair done up under a net, with trail runners on, shepherding their misbehaving little brothers. I am guessing Mennonites? Anyway, they were more than amicable and chatty.
THEORIES OF PENNSYLVANIA ROCKSPennsylvania is known for its rocks and how bad they are or so I was told. When I asked again, they said, Northern Pennsylvania. When I got there and the rocks weren't bad, it was the 501 shelter. When I got there and asked where the rocks are, it was Port Clinton. Well, I am past there. So where are the rocks? THEORIES:1) Xero Shoes, who make the sandals I carry, derisively call the kind of shoes I wear ""foot coffins"" because they deaden all sensation and keep you from feeling the ground under your feet. Maybe that is not a bad thing in Pennsylvania and I just haven't noticed the rocks.2) Frog in boiling water. The rocks have gotten worse and worse and since it happened gradually, I didn't notice how horribly bad they are.3) The rocks are still farther north. Maybe I will report on them tomorrow, but there are only 80 more miles of Pennsylvania to do.4) The rocks in Pennsylvania are a bit worse than elsewhere, but not by much.

There is a shed which counts as a shelter, but the place was packed. By the time I got there, ten tents had been set up as overflow, so there was a crowd. One surprise was OG was there, not the OG traveling with Boston, but the first one that I met. It was nice to catch up and it was fun hanging out with the new people.
One advantage of hanging with OG is he has a You Tube channel and fans, two of which provided us a trail magic lunch. PTL (the husband of the team) had hiked the trail in 2020, the COVID year and had a lot of stories about that. He had a trail angel, Iceman, follow him the whole way including five days of trail magic in the 100 mile wilderness.
The hike today was a short one, ending at 1:00. There was a fantastic view of what we saw on the Pulpit yesterday, but from a different angle. There is a section ahead called the knife edge, you are up on the rocky ridge with nowhere to go but forward. PTL said that THAT is where the rocks start.
That will have to wait for Wednesday because today and tomorrow I am taking a Nero and a zero at the Shanty at Blue Mountain which is a B&B amidst the farmland I have been looking at.

I also made out my plans for the end of the trip. Friday, I will be at the Delaware Water Gap, just short of New Jersey and I will be done on May 25.Two section hikers, Brian and Kevin were staying at the B&B, so we loaded the three packs into the trunk of the car. They just barely fit. We drove up to the trailhead and headed off. Today is windy and pleasantly cool and my plan today was a short day ending near water which is scarce in this section. I had been told that the rocks start at the Knife Edge, a few miles north of the starting point. I passed one nice ledge with a view east and then we were on it.Really, it wasn't a big deal, a fun scramble on boulders, nothing too precarious, about 75 yards long. There was a point where I went down backwards with my hands on the rock, but that is just me being cautious. While at the B&B, I did some reading on the rock I have been traveling on. The Knife Edge is sandstone, part of the Tuscarora Formation if I have it right. The rock dates from the Silurian period which is about 400 million years ago. It was part of the sandy coast of an ancient ocean. Anyway, it is a handsome gray stone that I have become very familiar with the last couple of weeks.There are more rocky stretches, intermingled with dirt and pine needle trail further along. There are many lady slippers and the understory is mostly young fern. Near the end of the day, we passed over a tunnel for Interstate 476 that goes under the ridge we are walking on. I guess the ridge is too long for them to route it through Lehigh Gap which is upcoming. After the tunnel, you come out on the western face of the ridge which is totally exposed and today very windy. It is easy trail with great views down into the Lehigh river valley and the small towns along the river.I finished the day at 3:00 at a campsite below the shelter.

The first stop of the day was down to the Lehigh river where a road crosses it. In front of me was a rough mountain with exposed rock across its face. Now on the AT, when there is something in front of you, it usually means you have to climb it. That is hint #1. I still had hope the trail might go around it though. Anyway, I crossed the road and followed the trail a little further until it diverged with a sign that said ""winter bypass"". That is hint #2. If you see a sign like that, you know there is something treacherous ahead. And there was.I quickly found myself on the loose rock at the base of the rock slide with blazes frequently spaced to show you how to do it. Much of the rock was this handsome orange and grey conglomerate with white stones embedded in it. They might have been marble, but I am unsure because limestone would have to be metamorphosed for that to happen and limestone I think is composed of shellfish and I am not sure that there is enough geological time from their inception to the rock's formation 400 million years ago. Anyway, I was about to be intimately familiar with that rock. The ascent reminded me of Webster Cliffs in the Whites, an exposed ascent that at times seems almost vertical and is hand over hand. You keep your weight forward and try to maintain three points of contact as you push or pull yourself up. Anyway, it was a spectacular climb and a lot of fun. I do it old man style, slow and on the downhill portions, backwards.
Once you are up there, the trail goes from side to side on the ridge, giving you either clear views south and east or north and west. Bleeding heart flowers grow in the crevices of the rocks and there are many small paper white birches, the first I have seen. Notably absent, the mayapples appear to be in my past. Ferns dominate the forest floor. It is as if I passed a line and the mayapples can't grow north of it, the change was so sudden.
Much of the rest of the day was spent in cool forest. The rocks have increased in number and have taken on that small pointy nature I was warned about. Apparently, the last 40 miles of Pennsylvania is what people remember. I leapfrogged with a nice couple from Pittsburgh who are flip flopping from Harper's Ferry, Twist Tie and Spreadsheet. I think I saw them on Pulpit Rock several days ago. They were supposed to show at this campsite but haven't. They may have decided to stay at the shelter before which is nice and has water.So, as of a couple hours ago, I have less than a week left. I find myself walking slower, not because I am tired, but to savor what I have left. Nevertheless, I miss all of you at home dearly and can't wait to see you again.","George Outerbridge shelter

It looked like it might be a bear, but I convinced myself that it was a black dead tree stump. But as I got closer, it moved. It was an adolescent, probably born last spring. I spoke in a loud voice, just to keep its attention and to not surprise its mother in case she was around. That is the real danger, getting between a mother and cub. Anyway, I was telling it that I didn't want any part of it and that it didn't want any part of me, moving confidently away from it. I did not take a picture. It's not fair to the bear to interact with it at all. All in all, a fantastic encounter that went well.
The rocks continued to get worse through the early part of the day, but the forest was beautiful. In contrast to Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, you can see forever through the Pennsylvania forests and the ferns or huckleberries in the understory go on forever. I met a hunter in full camo in the woods with his shotgun, hunting for turkeys. I had heard from my hunter acquaintance last week that turkeys are the hardest to hunt. Talking to them both has given me an appreciation for the mindset of a hunter, at least these two. There is a lot of respect and appreciation for the animal and intimate knowledge of them too. There is a certain honesty to it, being responsible for where your food is coming from. Nevertheless, I am not going to do it.
Anyway, I eventually came to a sign for the Wolf Rocks bypass. There it is again. You know something is up when there is a bypass. The trail goes up on a rocky ledge with lots of boulder hopping and views to the west. Anyway, the big surprise was that after you get down off of Wolf Pass and cross some power lines, the rocks end and there is smooth trail for two miles. Also, there is new rock, a maroon color, like those used in brownstones. I passed over a gas line. They cut the trees there as well and there was a view of the Delaware river and New Jersey beyond. Now I know how the Israelites felt, looking over the river Jordan and seeing the promised land.
There is a big drop, maybe 1500 feet to the town of Delaware Water Gap. It's popular with day hikers. I guess they come for the views, but it is a pretty challenging climb. You go through tunnels of rhododendrons which are beautiful and cool.
Anyway, I am staying in the local Presbyterian Church basement which is set up for hikers for a donation. Sort of an any port in a storm situation. Onto New Jersey.","Tent site at mile 1280

For me, these salamanders are emblematic of the AT. You see them all the time in the summer and there they are, like you, making their way slowly down whatever rocky or smooth path we all follow. None for a month, then four in one day, wow.
I guess I should start at the beginning. I headed out of the church with Prophet before dawn. Prophet must be at least ten years older than me. He's gentle and entertaining and quiet. He is also an incredibly strong hiker. He started on March 15 at Springer. That is more than two weeks after the young fast guys and he has almost caught them. Wow.
Anyway, we went over the toll bridge at the Delaware Water Gap with cars whizzing past at 70 MPH or more and after the road walk made our way into the forest. It is still rocky, towards the end of the day, it looked like the rocks were petering out, but I am not convinced. The trail goes around Sunfish Pond which is a glacial pond. The rocks there were bad, big pointy things and you had to hop from one to another.
There were some ledges, which probably had good views, but today is rainy and we were in the clouds. But there was a well-developed beaver pond. The beaver crew had built an impressive dam and a perfect lodge right in the middle. There was evidence of beaver activity all over the place. They even chopped down a tree with a white blaze. I had to laugh. Definitely the high point of the day.
The mountain laurel is so close to blooming. I hope I see some in bloom in the next couple days. Also, about the mayapples. The scientist in me has to admit when his theory is wrong. I saw some yesterday just before going into town. They were pretty sad and dishevelled but there nonetheless, so there is no one line beyond which they do not grow.","Delaware water gap

I am rejiggering my schedule a little so that I have a Nero on Tuesday where I will be staying at a nice B&B on Greenwood Lake. It meant a long day today and another one tomorrow, but it is a sacrifice I am making so that Future Lee can put his feet up for a spell. After that a longish day, another Nero and I see Kate who I miss so much. Right now, I am kind of like a horse that smells the barn.
So today, New Jersey is more gentle ups and downs rather than steep climbs and flats like Pennsylvania was. To the west, there is nothing but trees and hills, to the East, some lakes, some summer cottages and a couple of farms. There are nice views along the way. Today started out cloudy and cold, but with a high cloud ceiling, so I could see everything. The rocks however have not abated. This afternoon there was a stretch that was relentless for perhaps ten miles 
One interesting thing about today, there were all these teens and almost all of them were Black. First, the girls, then the boys on the trail. There must have been 75 of each, hiking in groups of ten. I mention that they were Black because there are so few Black hikers. There are some day hikers, especially around Maryland, but I've only met one Black backpacker on this section. Getting teens to have a sense of ownership and mastery in the outdoors is an important way to get them to enjoy it later in life. I do know if one organization, Outdoor Afro, which does this kind of thing if you are interested in supporting them.
I have noticed that the tree leaves aren't getting as chewed up by caterpillars as last year. I have seen some gypsy moth caterpillars on the ground, but the oaks look like they are in good shape.
One thing about where I am staying tonight, it is called high point shelter because it is just below the highest point in the state. There is a monument on top. I didn't go there. It was getting late and it was uphill about half a mile.","Tent site at mile 1317

Not Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664239,"Today was a day of contrasts, walking through fields, swamps, marshes and meadows but also some steep climbs. There were some views but there were more flowers, buttercups, white and purple asters, even a yellow iris. I am constantly accompanied by the smell of honeysuckle in the woods. There were even some mayapples, so much for my theory.
The day started with walks through fields with great views. The redwing blackbirds were out. They would be with me much of the day. Then, well, I am not sure what the difference between a swamp and a marsh is. I think a marsh, you walk around and enjoy while a swamp you walk through. Anyway, there was this swamp. They put puncheon boards which are two boards nailed to a log at either end. I start on the boards and as I go some of them are floating, just a little, the logs being like pontoons. You step on them and they go just a little bit underwater. Well, ok, that has happened to me before. I get to one, it is kind of floating there, not where it was supposed to be. I stepped on it anyway and it predictably sank. Anyway, to make a long story shorter, eventually they started sinking shin deep. My shoes got very wet, my feet nice and cold. I get to the end and there is this sign, ""No, no, don't even think of going through the swamp, it is flooded"". I didn't see the corresponding sign on my end.
The trail goes through two marshes. The first is audobony with a hut to hide in to look at the birds. It was somewhat engineered. You walk on this berm with outlets every once in a while to control the water level. The second is a boardwalk. It is the only wheechair accessible part of the trail. Lots of wildflowers, lots of blackbirds. Lots of people just out for a stroll.After that, there is a garden store that sells bakery items, ice creams and drinks. I had a double scoop, pistachio and coconut and a Gatorade. Good idea because the next thing to do was climb ""stairway to heaven"" and I needed the energy. Stairway might describe it. The trail maintainers have built steps out of rocks. But there are other rocks as well, so my Pennsylvania PTSD kicked in. But I got up it anyway. So I am here with JB, Echo and hot sauce slinger. Tomorrow is a Nero.","High point shelter

The first part of the trail was easy enough so it gave me time to contemplate as I end this. There are the trees. They are my constant friends. Trees are selfless, both in that they have no consciousness (I think) and they only give. An oak provides food and shelter for so many small animals and its leaves compost into the dirt in which everything grows. When they die, animals hollow them out to live in them and when they fall, insects eat them and the moss and fungi grow on them. A tree, fallen across the trail, you can take it as an impediment. I make sure to touch the fallen tree and say to myself, ""I'm sorry you lost your life"". It was a living thing, sometimes for 60 years or more and it deserves that sort of respect.
Anyway, second part of a short day, the terrain started getting rough. The rock here is the maroon sandstone that I described earlier with white rocks embedded in it. I am thinking now it might be quartz. Anyway there are ledges that you have to hike on top of or climb. One indicator of the difficulty: there was a place where they had cemented rungs of rebar into the rock because you couldn't get up it any other way. So there are rocks. There were views though into Greenwood Lake where I am staying.
One great thing. I check into the motel I am staying at and go up the road to get something to eat and there walking down the road is Odin who I had last seen in Elmwood Wayside in the Shenandoahs. Wow! That is how it is, someone may be just a day ahead or behind for weeks and then you see them.

He didn't bat an eye when I said 6:00. I can't say enough good things about the place. It is nothing fancy for sure but has everything a hiker needs and Jim is eager to please. I woke up at 5:00. There is a dunkins right next to the motel so I stood in the drive up window and got two egg sandwiches, home fries and coffee which set me up well for the morning.
I started off strong. This area is rolling hills. There was almost a mile of elevation today but it was mostly up and down with the occasional scramble. On one of the first scrambles something bad happened. My water bottles go into my pack at an angle, I guess so they are easier to pull out. On my old pack, they were vertical. Anyway, when doing the scramble, sometimes I am on all fours with the pack on my back like a turtle shell. One water bottle slipped out, bounced once on the trail and then went over the edge of the precipice falling into a crevasse from which it will never be retrieved. So much for leave no trace. Vintage 2023 Greenville Lake Lodge Motel water will be there in that mess of rocks for eternity unless the water freezes and expands, breaking the bottle.
You improvise in these situations, so I spent the day with one water bottle and my dirty water bag half full. No biggie. Except I feel guilty for leaving the other behind. I still think of a Gatorade bottle that slipped out of my pack without me noticing somewhere on Franconia Ridge in 2017.
Oh, I saw another bear. Same result. It didn't want any part of me and kind of shuffled away from me.
I saw the first Mountain Laurel bloom today. I have timestamped evidence that May 24 is when they first appear, at least here.
I am in Harriman State Park. Things here look, well, curated. The trees are too far apart and the forest floor is grass. The trail here is pretty tame, except for the lemon squeezer which is a tunnel under some humongous boulders the size of houses. It was too tight to go through with my pack on. There was a ledge above so I threw my pack on the ledge, then clambered up to get it.
So tomorrow I see Kate who I miss so much. She is only 9 miles away from me, so little distance. I am going to wake up early tomorrow and go all out to get there.","Greenwood Lake

I'm back home in Arlington, Massachusetts right now, looking over Spy Pond in the early evening under a cloudy sky. Today was great, just a little nine miler, but still.I wanted to meet Kate with plenty of time to re-enter the civilized world, shower and change and all, so I made up my mind to start as early as possible. It was a good decision. I was up at 4:15 am and walking a little after 5:00. There's always quite a bit of light before sunrise, so although I needed my headlamp to pack up, I didn't need it by the time I got going.I'd heard that you could see the New York skyline from somewhere in the area, but I hadn't yet found the place. As the sun started to rise, I found the place, a bit of a scramble to get up there, but there are some ledgy cliffs and a view and there it was, orange and white with the rising sun reflecting off one or another of the spires. A short distance as these things go, but there I was amidst the rocks and early morning birdsong and that is so much different from being in Manhattan. A little further and I could see the Hudson River, Croton Point and just beyond that, Ossining where I grew up. I'll leave the metaphors to the reader. I've been told that's what authors should do.The next adventure is the new trail reroute to keep hikers from crossing the Palisades Parkway. The AT used to cross there. I think the speed limit is probably 65 and it sees heavy traffic. So now, they've got detour signs on the trail and to dissuade you from taking the original route, they've piled some big trees sideways to block off the old route. The new route is tame and easy until you cross the parkway, then it goes up a trail with both blue and white blazes, rough, rocky and scrambly and then it reunites with the old AT. Just another day walking.You cross a road, start walking on some old paved but abandoned route, then start climbing stairs on your way to Bear Mountain. The trail on Bear Mountain is a demonstration of best practices for trailbuilding and they've done it to the nines. There's a fine gravel base where it's flat and where it is not, there are nice, even hewn steps, sometimes winding their way through gaps in the rocky cliffs. Pretty impressive and a lot of hard work and it felt like they'd rolled out the red carpet for my last two miles. At the top, there's an observation tower. You can even drive up there, Kate's waiter told her, ""no judgement"". I agree on that one. It's a great view from the top and perhaps a good introduction to the AT.So down the same well-manicured trail, to the Bear Mountain Inn to connect my footsteps from last year and then off to the Overlook Lodge where Kate and her friend Sue had spent the night. I was there by 10:30, so the shower and clean cotton clothes and, well, here I am, suddenly one of them, once again leaving the world of hiker trash behind. Feels so odd that something like that can happen so quickly but it did.To the AT class of 2023, good luck and hoping to reunite in the Maine woods in a couple months.","Brier Shelter

Next Wednesday, I'll drive up to Rangely, Maine with Kate and the day after, I'll get dropped off at the trailhead. It's only a couple weeks of hiking, but I am getting thrown in at the deep end. It's the tail end of Southern Maine. The first three days are the Sugarloafs, the Crockers and the Bigelows. It's been raining the last couple of weeks. Today is a dry day and we need that. I've been following the reports of trail conditions. There is a trail advisory for the Piscataquis River still because the water was higher than you'd like it. As always, there's a plan A and a plan B and a plan C. Plan A is to get there and find it's knee deep and not running too fast, which is my guess on the conditions today. Plan B is to get there and see that it's higher or faster than I would like and take the road walk around it. Plan C is to ford the East branch and then discover that the West branch is too difficult at the moment, camp in between and check the next day to see if it's receded. It's a similar plan for some of the other fords between Rangely and Katahdin. I'm following some of my friends from the first section I did. OG, Gummy Bear, River, Stickers, Cookie, Hellmans and Odin are doing the last section right now. They all made it through to Monson which is the gateway to the 100 mile wilderness and in worse conditions than I'm expecting to encounter. Bad Bat and Pigpen are making their way through Vermont and New Hampshire right now and I think they will be behind me at the start.I've tried to stay in shape, but I think I will hit the 4000 footers in front of me without real trail legs. I'm going to try and compensate with lighter weight. Despite being further North, it should be hotter and I'm going to leave my long baselayer bottoms and my hoodie (which I'll miss for sentimental reasons - I've had it with me on every hike since the Long Trail) behind. I'm thinking of ditching the bear canister too and hang my food. I did that through New Hampshire and Maine last year. It's a savings of more than two pounds and I can actually carry more food in the bag than I can in the canister. I just hope I don't get the line snagged in the fork of a branch - that is always a pain. Also, I'm going to resupply in Carabasset, Caratunk and Monson which means less food and less weight.On the plus side, it will beautiful and more remote than anything I've done before. I'll visit the alpine with good old granite and lichen and ponds that go on forever. It will be an adventure. And, it's only two weeks. And it could end at that sign, with the dramatic climb up Katahdin to the top and end of it all. I will still have 700 hundred miles to go, but there's some significance to standing at my first terminus.Talk to you later. I'll be journaling nightly, but it is likely that I'll have limited signal, especially in camp, so the reports may come in a little late. I will be keeping in touch with Kate using the Garmin which uses satellite.

Today was a bit of a challenge, three mountains, Saddleback, the Horn and Saddleback Junior, two of them over 4000 feet. It is Southern Maine still (although I crossed the 45th parallel in Rangely) so  there are steep ups and downs. Luckily today I had planned for a slow day and I needed that. From Saddleback to the Horn is alpine, small plants, lots of small flowers. The views were hazy today, but the cloud ceiling lifted when I was on top and I got good views of Rangeley and its lake. The mountains ara all bare granite. Granite is a plutonic rock, I alway think of it coming from Hades. It is like there is one single rock in New Hampshire and Maine and all the mountains are fashioned from it.

My knee started hurting pretty badly coming down off of Saddleback Junior last night. I pretty much limped into camp yesterday. Today, I started off descending poplar ridge and I could tell the problem wasn't going away. I can walk about four or five miles before the knee gets to the point where I have real problems walking. Going downhill is a big problem, uphill not so much. That isn't going to work, so I am getting off trail tomorrow at Sugarloaf and Kate, who is such an angel, is going to pick me up.
It is more than a shame. I guess I was lucky to do 700 miles earlier without incident, but it only took ten to do me in this time.
Anyway, the woods are beautiful. Luckily, there was only one downhill section at the beginning, then it was mostly flat walking through woods lush with moss. It was wet. It rained last night and anything that could be running was doing so with gusto. There was this one section on boards and the water was flowing under the boards like a stream, not in one place but for several hundred feet  When I made it to Orbeton Stream, the first rock hops were submerged so I just decided to ford it, walking straight in in my sneakers. There is a waterfall there which was gushing furiously. In Orbeton Stream, there are some rocks in the middle, perhaps 20 feet high and there was a crushed aluminum row boat up there. So I guess the water can get even higher.

The ridge between Spaulding and Sugarloaf was especially beautiful. It is all spruce and fir with an understory that is emerald green with lush moss, small firs, club moss and bead lillies. It is so wet here, but in a good way. That is where it all comes from.
It was only three miles and it seems like I can do that without too much pain if I take it slow. And there are advantages in going slow, time to take everything in. The side trail is listed as steep, but it was what you would expect for going up a mountain and not much more than that, not bad at all.When I got to the top of Sugarloaf, it was completely socked in with strong winds, but the clouds soon blew away giving views North and East. Sugarloaf is a ski resort, so there was a hut to control the ski lift at the top and they leave it unlocked. I surprised this thru hiker, Lizard, who had been up there 12 hours without seeing a person so she jumped when I showed up. This is her second backpacking trip ever and she has almost made it to 2000 miles. Her first was hiking the AT in 2020.
