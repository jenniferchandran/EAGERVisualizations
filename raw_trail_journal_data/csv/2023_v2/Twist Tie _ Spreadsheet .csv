Twist Tie & Spreadsheet ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661997,"In 10 days Kevin and I depart for Harper’s Ferry, WV, where we will attend the Flip Flop Festival and then head north on the Appalachian Trail. Having looked at lots of journal entries, I can’t help but wonder: are we starting way too late? My husband assures me the ATC schedules the FFF, which is a kick-off event, in late April for a good reason. The goal is to avoid the mud season and the black flies in New England, while still capitalizing on the favorable weather in the northern states. If all goes as planned, we’ll reach Katahdin by early August. 
Meanwhile, we have been carefully training and planning. In my next post I’ll share some images of our gear and some thoughts on food. 
By the way, no trail names yet, so I’ll leave that part blank for now.

Twist Tie & Spreadsheet ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662549,"Arrived via Amtrak, a slow but pleasant roll, in Harpers Ferry WV yesterday before noon. Neither of us slept much the night before nor on the train. 
Checked into the hotel and then attended  a Q&A session with past flip flop hikers. One of them managed to bring her knitting with her! Maybe she knitted replacement socks. 
Then we rested at the hotel and returned for the dinner event, where we met a wide range of fellow flip floppers, Including a 50ish couple of recently retired civil engineers from Florida, who plan to live on their sailboat after the hike. We had a lot in common! It is definitely an older crowd, Although not entirely, with many people who have just retired. 
Check out is at 11 today, after which we will do a short day to the Ed Garvey shelter.  Our plan is to take it easy for the first couple of weeks. This was some thing yesterday’s panel greatly encouraged to better avoid overuse injuries.","Harpers Ferry
