My oldest son is10 and the other is 6. He has Autism and no functional speech. We have hiked many trails over the past few years and have just started the AT. On Jan.1. The mild winter has made our average hikes of 6-8 miles possible. I have kept a paper log of the trips and will try to inpu as many as I can in the near future. Thank for reading and keep hiking.

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/378711,Left Cascade Lake and hooked up with AT in 1.13 miles. Went north and enjoyed the great views of Greenwood Lake and beyond. Boys are amazing troopers and really had no problems with outcrops and the ladder. Took wonderful video and even got one of all of us taken by a very nice couple. I even cut my knee against a tree while reading guidebook. Trail to village vista is tough and slow going. This is a great section to assess a persons ability and is overall the most challenging section from the Water Gap. We ended at 17a and went to creamery for excellent ice cream with a nice view. Our trail angel (Mom) came with a days worth of garage sale treasures. (Flippertree is the name of our retirement antique store look for us in about 15 years depending on if Christie is reflected or not). Anyway we may not be thru hikers but the sections we do are pretty good for a 7 and 10 year old. We only see kids on the short easier sections.,"cascade lake

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/378840,Walked on Mcdade Trail in Delaware Water Gap. It is a 31 Mile trail that goes parallel to Delaware River on PA side. We completed trail last year but had a special needs gathering to attend so we got out early. Route 209 had been ravaged by hurricane Irene and we wanted to see damage up close. There was a landslide that destroyed the section of the trail and we had to do a quick vertical woods walk to closed road. Sat in shade by Raymondskill Creek and pulled off a couple of ticks. Really is a beautiful area and hike and would like to someday come a straight circular hike using the AT. If you are ever in the area there are many great waterfalls and day hikes that are more than worth it. The boys are exhausted their stamina is great not quite as good in the broiling sun. We will get our summer legs soon. Back to school for all of us with a lake house trip planned for Memorial day as wheel. As tackling Agony Grind.,"Milford Beach

Finished at the creamery and enjoyed every lick. Nick ate ice cream (we gave him some even though he has many allergies and really should not have dairy). Our plan is to finish from Bear Mountain Bridge to Wind Gap PA by summer. The boys are in incredible shape and Tyler proved it during spring soccer. Nicks 7 birthday is Saturday the 2nd (trail day).

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/380270,"Today was a snow day. Our last day is the 22nd no matter what so the distict gave us Thursday Friday and Tuesday off. As much as I love the kids it is nice to have some down time. After yardwork went to Mcdade Trail in Delaware Water Gap. The boys and I finished the 31 miles of the trail last year as well as the Paulinskill and Sparta Branch Trails. Anyway I have always run biked and kayaked for fitness. The boys kayak with me Tyler in his own and Nick with me. He keeps his hands in the water the whole time and he loves all water as we travel to family lake house many times in the spring summer and fall. We kayak swim and hike dirt roads when we are there. Back to today I am thinking of entering a sprint triathlon in Sept. tat substitutes kayking for swimming. Ran 3 miles kayked 2.7 and biked 10.4. My stamina was excellent for the first time this year as I can only atttribute it to our winter hiking. I am trying to figure out how to put Nick on a bike, he will always remove his feet. Brutal heat and nature is truly a test and I am always impressed with all of the thru-hikers who brave and perservere such conditions. I did 16 with a bike and kayak and these people do more than this daily. Went to an early dinner date with Mom as this very rarely happens and it ended a wonderful 90 degree snow day.","North of Eshback Trailhead

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/381916,Today was awesome. We passed a huge group of people who were really working on the trail next to Fitzgerald Falls. They were all very nice and let us pass. These people do a great job and their cars were still ther when we picked up our car around 6. This section is really tough. All the ups and downs givevabgreat workout and really tested us. There were some nice views although we did feel cheated because the camera went on the fritz. We passed various hikers and they are always surprised to see us if we are far from a street/trailhead. Two men and their dog were really surprised that we had hiked from the Water Gap and you should have seen their face when we told them that Nick has Autism. At the top of Agony Grind we met two men who also were really surprised to osee us up on the top. We made good time time and mom picked us up at the perfect time(she had a great day picking up all the treasures. We ate at McDonald's and can't wait to hit the hay. Took long showers to get rid of any unwanted parasites. Go figure we found one on Nick after playing in the backyard not very often after long hikes with lots of Deep Woods Off. Sun.

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/383659,Started at Seven Lakes Drive and went the wrong way for a short stretch. Turned around and saw some very nice views. Harriman is tough with all of the ups and downs. The boys really do not complain and Tyler is always happy if he can douse his hat in a stream. Passed some thru hikers and some serious section hikers. Also passed a group that arrives in a van and really moves when they hike. We have passed them before. I am always impressed with the eclectic mix of people who hike it really is wonderful. Passed Brien shelter an it was filling up at 4. Felt good after only afew conditioning hikes last weekend. I had horrible flulike symptoms missed some of the last days of school and even though I tested negative for lime the specialist put me on antibiotics just to be safe. We are really prepared for hiking I worry more about our backyard. Will head up to lakehouse and do conditioning hike.

It was hot but not so bad with the shade. There were plenty of brooks to dunk hats in. We passed Fingerboard shelter and connected with the Long Path and came back to Lake Tiroti. It was nice as we passed a metal shelter that Nick ran back and forth in like a wild man. We got icecream at the vending machine and swam in the lake for a while. We got Nick some gluten free fries on the way home and really had a good time. Tomorrow we take our version of a zero at the lake hous and swim swim swim.

Perkins Tower is nice and Nick kept saying ""tower"" right after he saw it. The steps down to the Inn are great and the Trail Conference did a wonderful job. Took a break next to Hessian Lake and spoke with Dog Whisperer from Indiana. He was extremely nice and answered many of Tyler's thru hike questions. Thentrip back up is tough but as usual the boys were up for the task. Nick has been sleeping and it has to be attributed to all of the hiking. My father is a history buff and I think I will take him up to the tower to see the foliage and read the history. The weather was very nice and we appreciated the entire hike.","7 Lakes Drive

Nick was running back and fort but not for long. When the manager came into our room I was cleaning Nick up because he had an accident in his pants. We explained and he showed us his Autism Awareness bracelet and tat was the last we heard of it. Went swimming and Nick slept the night. I am posting this at 2 am waiting for him to go back asleep. This used to be nightly but thankfully it is just a few times a week. 5 miles may not be a lot to some but when your dealing with bathroom issues, crying for no reason and operating on little sleep it may be like 15 -20. Anyway, we hiked around the park for 3 miles one day and 4.65 on the fourth. We were introduced to Rocksylvania but did enjoy the wider it seemed trails. Planned to swim in the park pool but realized the immense crowd would intimidate Nick. All of the lots were full and not even half the day before. Decided to take our time on the way home went to Gettysburg and stopped at Bass Pro Shop. Want to go and try it again on a better weekend and have Mom pick us up for more miles. Will finish short section Friday and push on in NY. Have to figure out how to camp with Nick. Every time we stop at a shelter he runs back and forth like he is on a stage.

Swam in the crowded lake and ate icecream from the vending machines. Nick goes to farm camp next week to work with animals. There really something about the way an autistic child relates to these animals. Tyler and I will bike and kayak. Then we go to Cooperstown and to Oak Island NC for a week.

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/390195,"White Blaze Fever hits and it is understandable even at our small level. We have been everywhere in the last month hiking, biking and kayaking. Exercise has been the theme of the summer. The other day we were kayaking the Wallkill River in NJ and took a break at a launch at Oil City parking area in the refuge. Seeing the blazes motivated me to try and finish the NY section of the trail. My wife found a flea market Elephant something not far from the trail and with the forecast for excellent weather off we went. Decided to work our way back from CT border to Bear Mountain in a bunch of day trips. Went to Wiley Shelter tried the pump to no avail. Kept moving at a good pace and reached the Pawling preserve where we saw many day hikers. Met up with some thruhikers and as always they were very pleasant. Chatted with Traveler who was really moving. He is from Florida and is very impressed with NJ/NY. The reputation that these states have is really interesting and funny the AT helps show the true people and area. The reality shows really have ruined it and although I have met these types they are few and far between and more than likely not on the AT. (Maybe at Sunfish Pond my son is still amazed that we encountered a woman in high heels there in the spring). I sure wish him and his companions luck as they hope to summit October 1. The spaceship silo is cool and Nick likes climbing the ladders over fences. The Metro Station is neat if not a sore thumb. We actually met two women who were from the city and were waiting for the train. They were very nice and they took our pictures in front of the stop. The boys Mom picked us up after a good day of treasure hunting. Nick is running back and forth as I write and I cant figure out where he gets the energy.

We live 4 miles from High Point and traveling with the price of gas is not easy. We went to Dennytown Road and traveled to 301 and then back on a well marked and maintained blue trail. Nick is either moving quickly or dawdling along. On the blue trail we stopped and had breaks by two lakes and really enjoyed the weather. Last week went to the Walkway over the Hudson where they took an old rairoad bridge and made it into a walkway for all types of exercise and it connects to an old rail trail. We passed an older couple and the wife didn't seem very enthused. The husband pointed to the boys and commented that they were able to walk the trail then she should have no problem. I mentioned a few rock scrambles and on the went. We met them later on their way back and couldn't believe that the kids traversed the trail. I didn't even mention that Nick is Autistic. We will keep hiking and hope to finish NY this calendar year. Soccer for Tyler and various activities for Nick may slow us down in these cases we'll hike closer to home. The AT is our favorite and Nick will on occasion stop and look at a white blaze. It's so strange he has passed thousands with no reaction and out of nowhere he points one out.

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/392979,Today was beautiful. Mom dropped us off on 55 where we left off last time. We started with a hill walk and then felt as if we were on a roller coaster with all the ups and downs. We made great time and even stopped at the Morgan Stewart shelter. It really is funny as you come closer to a trailhead you start meeting all kinds of people. We met a father who was very surprised to see us as there was no car in the parking lot. He asked how far we went and he was in disbelief. I didn't even tell him about Nicks autism. When we ran into him later he was making excuses for his kids not going very far. It would be great to tell everyone why we do this. It is necessary for a feeling of normalcy as a family. Nick was up 4 nights this week from about 12 to 3 and that is better than what it used to be. We have about 23 miles to go to finish NY. Soccer and other activities will get in the way but we should finish very soon. We want to do some more kayaking before retiring them for the winter. I love the fact that the AT takes us to places we would never go. The plan is to do Conn. next year and a big chunk of PA.

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/393450,Went for a shorter hike because the weather seemed iffy and we didn't get started until after Tyler's soccer. It was really cute seeing Nick run around the field in a yellow Penney that I put on him after the game. He participates in various activities for Autistic children but it is really hard to bring him to games because he is difficult to keep him under control. Autism is really a puzzle. Sometimes after hiking he will sleep other times like tonight up at 1until 4. Very weird there is no rhyme or reason. Anyway the hike was tough with many rocks and ups and downs. The views are probably nice but with the leaves not down hard to see. We will try and finish up in Oct. our big problem are activities and trips to the shore and lake house and the availability of Mom for pickup. I Can in a very small way relate to the big hikers in that I just want to finish. We are so close about 15 miles.

Views of Hudson are probably really cool without leaves. Turned around at Appalachian Deli, after boys chowder down on chips and slush puppies. Looked forward to coming in from other direction on Columbus Day after we spend a couple of days down the shore. With only 13 miles left of NY we should finish by end of month. Will try to finish to Wind Gap PA before end of 2012. Almost at 400 miles for year and will try to push for 500. You can't imagine the kind of shape these guys are in.

There were many people hiking the area on this beautiful Columbus Day. We sent pictures to Mom and she loved them even if she got nervous about the elevation. We are planning to finish NY on Sunday and really are getting that feeling of accomplishment. By the way we spotted two other Autistic hikers who were older than Nick but exhibited many of the tell tale signs.

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/395097,"We did it! We completed New York and let me tell you it ain't easy. This may be our favorite section that we hiked from the Water Gap to Connecticut. There are two really nice views and easily the best shelter along this part of the trail. Mom met us as Nick was climbing up and down the bunk beds. The view over Canopus Lake is really nice as well as the one on Shenandoah Mountain. The only other shelter in this 150 mile or so trek is the Murray secret shelters. Tyler thinks Anthony's Nose is the best view I happen to think its Pinwheel Vista. There really are so many great views it is awesome. We also passed 400 miles for the year using our GPS watch. We are going to try to finish from Windgap PA. And pass 500 miles of all trails before 2013. Next year we will add PA and Conn. A.T. Miles. One strange thing did occur, during the late winter we were hiking the A.T. Near Greenwood Lake. We were hiking a flat section on what may have been a old tote road. Anyway Tyler asked if I had just seen a man walking perpendicular across the trail ahead I didn't see anything as I was probably paying attention to Nick. Tyler said he was pale white and wearing a pin stripped suit and carrying a briefcase. We talked about it being a ghost etc. and dismissed it as being the mind of a 10 year old. The other day Weird New Jersey came out with anew issue and it had sightings of a similar individual doing the same walk. The only difference was the man was wearing a hat in the stories and the stories were more from Sothern NJ.. The was a story of an insane escapee with a stripped shirt in the same general area.

We hiked quite a bit during Hurricane Sandy with a week off of school and no power. Gas was a bit hard to get so we stayed closer to home. We started PA and let me tell you this is a really great hike especially northbound. It really has everything the trail that we have seen has to offer. Several scenic overlooks as well as a lake, some streams old tote roads and the Kirkridge shelter. We ran into many unprepared day hikers as we descended Mt. Minsi. Mom picked us up and we went to Red Robin where Nick ate gluten free fries and a hamburger. The temperature was around 48 with bright sunshine that really made the views spectacular. Mom found several treasures so we will be back before the new year and hope for a clear winter to eat up big chunks of this and many other trails.

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/397078,Well we finished what I thought might not be possible Wind Gap to Connecticut border. The boys are really conditioned well and speed through 8 miles pretty easily. This section has a steep climb at first and then is relatively flat. The only problem is that it is rocky rocksylvania rocky. We got a later start and finished in fog and darkness. This was spooky and Tyler said that Nicks continuous giberish calmed his nerves. If anyone else was on the trail I think seeing their outline would have taken years off my life. We will try to get to the middle of PA and all of CT in 2013. That is at least the plan. We are very close to 500 miles for the year and will finish that up very soon.   On the 15th we hiked Sams Point in NY. Let me tell you it is really worth it. The Long Path travels through there and there are great scenic overlooks. Vanderkill Fall advertises that it is one of the last great place on earth and they are right. These falls may be the best in the area and we have seen many of them. I read where the cliffs remind people of the southwest almost out of a roadrunner cartoon. They are very right the biggest problem was Tyler and my fear of Nick near the edge. If you ever go there you will know exactly what I mean. If you live within a 50 mile or so radius of Highpoint Nj you have visit this preserve. Part of the hike you feel like you are at the beach near dunes. Anyway visit if you can we will be back.

We made it back to the white blazes after a good bit of eclectic hiking this winter and early spring. I mention the seasons because that is the song Nick seems to sing over and over during our hikes. He has an IPad and really does some impressive things with it. Tyler has informed me of every aspect of Minecraft and I now know much more about it than any man my age should. These are some of the benefits that occur during 5 or so hours of hiking. Mom dropped us off and went on to score many treasure finds at Elephants Trunk Flea Market. The hike itself was not that easy. There is a long switchback climb that seemed to last forever. This was followed by many ups and downs. The campsite area is really nice with the brook really babbling. We finished just as the mosquitoes were coming out. To do Connecticut and PA to Swatara Gap this season will take some planning but I think we can do it. The boys are great in the car and the family time is awesome. We live about 4-5 miles from the High Point Monument so you know how far we must travel to reach trailheads.

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/420518,WET!!!!!! With all of the recent rains the trail was quite flooded everywhere we went. Just after Lynne dropped us off we had to immediately ford across Macedonia brook and then walk uphill. Our boots were soaked but after some walking dried quite a bit as we traversed Caleb's Peak and St. John's ledges. These were great views and we were really moving. We passed many scouts and Nick was singing Wheels on the bus the whole way down. Tyler is the best older brother who deals with Nick extremely well as we hike. He pushes him when needed and casually corrects him when he seems to take the more difficult routes on rocks. Nick fell because he tried to run on a flat stretch. He has a nasty bruise on his side. He whines a little and then keeps moving. This is only the third time I've ever seen him fall after over 1000 miles of hiking over the years it is always on flat stretches. Amazing!!! Anyway after doing Miles in Rocksylvania Connecticut was nice. We spoke to a thru hiker Gummy Bear briefly and she asked Nick if he likes hiking of course he really didn't respond but did wave goodbye. We made it to the river and really moved our now almost dry boots once again were soaked as it was unavoidable the mud and floods were everywhere. The Houtatonic river was really flowing. We saw a kayaker moving so fast he didn't need a paddle. When we finally finished Nicks boots were heavier than both of ours he really is a warrior. My wife originally was going to meet us on river road but the GPS had her too far north. I decided we could make it to route 4 and hoped she got the message our last communication was cut off because my cell phone died. Another hiker had told me the reception was not great and trying to locate reception drained the battery. I did jot down her number I haven't memorized it never have had to. Because the exta mile and a half is up and over it took longer than we thought. She drove up and down fom Mohawk Trail back and fort looking for us. When we saw her it was like Xmas morning for the the three of us. She is really our trail angel. Funny thing about Autism Nick probably wasn't worried he just was wondering how much further well never know. Learned a couple lessons in preparation for the future and I guess that is what life is all about. With school closing we ae right on target for our goals. We hike somewhere every weekend but there really is something to the AT. Oh yeah mom we to super yard sales in Storyville ny and scored a lot of stock for her store. All in all a great day!

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/425653,"Since my last entry we have hiked, biked and kayaked for many miles. Nick was at a camp with farm animals where he feeds them and tends to them in any way necessary it really is incredible how the animals can sense his gentle nature. There are also bounce houses and water slides etc. for a really full fun day of camp. During this time Tyler and I biked and kayaked for a total of about 40 miles each. Mostly in the Delaware Water Gap we drop off the kayaks drive down the river and bike back up to the Kayaks and switch. If I ever am able to do a kayak triathlon this is part of the training regiment. We can't really bike with Nick but did get him out there many times with mom picking us up at our down river destination. He really loves being in the same kayak as myself with his hands in the water. For anyone hiking the AT in NJ you can see some of the river we have done when on the trail between sunfish pond and Catfish Fire Tower. Anyway as always the white blazes come calling. Mom will be with us later this summer so we connected a small area between Hoyt Road and Bulls Bridge in Connecticut. It had may ups and downs both figuratively and literally. 10 Mile hill was especially tough for Nick on the way back. He balked and took impromptu breaks. on the other side it was if nothing happened and he made great time. We stopped at the shelter doused our hats and heads and made our way. It looks like we are sweating quite a bit mor than we really are although it was about 95 degrees with higher humidity. The trail shade made it bearable as well as the decent breeze at the top. We ran into and chatted with a few through hikers and a group that was building/repairing steps on the hill. Everyone is so pleasant on the trail and when I mention Autism they are always understanding. Near the end there were drinks in a creek that Tyler was excited about and he drank a can of Pepsi. He now wants to leave something for hikers closer to home as we live close to High Point New Jersey and do have the capability. I actually pass over the trail in Culvers Gap every day on my way to school. Nick is running around the room as I write and I really do not know where he gets the energy. I just want to thank everyone for their kind words and please keep them coming. We have had a very active summer and we will surely have more to come.","Hoyt RoadConnecticut

We just kept spraying and if I have to admit it I was probably the most bothered. The guidebook said this area is well known for mosquitoes. We really moved today and after an initial climb it was just ups and downs I think they are called PUDs. Nick does not like hills, who really does? He becomes whiney at times but after the climb he really moves. Tyler and I must sound like drill officers sternly berating him saying ""come on, no sitting etc."" believe us he can do it. This combined with whininess can look like an unpleasant experience. Believe me it is not. I do at times feel like Pistol Pete's or Todd Marinovichs fathers but with autism this sometimes has to be done. Anyway, this hike was a good AT hike. Hang Glider view was nice as well as Belters Bump I really dislike summer hikes the most. Foliage blocks too much. The road walk going beside the High School was a little strange and a tad uncomfortable. We enjoyed ending at the wheel chair flat pathway and walked over the iron bridge went back and settled in front of the power plant while waiting for Lynne. There is a spout and shower right there.

At about the halfway point of the summer we have biked, kayaked and hiked other trails more than even I thought. Getting to the AMC cabin trail was really neat and rural. We drove by Bish Bash falls and that really looks like a place to check out in the future. Hiking into Sages Ravine reminded me a little of Rocksylvania. It is a beautiful area and it really reminds me of the Delaware water Gap. The gap is my home turf and I do not think there is a trail or waterfall, road or part of the river that the boys and I have not traversed. Anyway if all you have ever seen is the AT part you may not agree but if you have gone to Adams Creek, Adams Falls, Van Campens Glen, Raymondskill Falls, Dingmans Falls the trais at PEEC just to mention a few you can relate to what I am saying. Check it out I know you will agree. We went to the campsite and turned around for a nice hike we probably would have gone further but it is a long drive.

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/430543,We did the Blue Mountain Loop and ended with a walk across the bridge. We have hiked over 150 miles this summer but there really is something to the AT. When you walk and finish a hike in other places you get a feeling of accomplishment it just isn't the same as the AT. We liked the views and the fact that we walked over the Turnpike Tunnel. The views are really nice from the blue trail and Devils Pulpit. I think the rocks give PA a bad rap these views are really good and right up there with some in Nj NY and Connecticut. I actually am a tad partial to the views in the Catskills they really are spectacular. Some of the hikes there are really worth the trip. With our action adventure summer winding down we are nearing all of our goals. We want to kayak ten more miles of the Delaware by Hawks Nest. Tyler and I have biked quite often and just finished a 20 miler that had him smiling like he just hit a home run. Tomorrow we will be hiking Connecticut and are really getting close to finishing that state. Next year the plan is to section hike various interesting AT spots that I have read about while checking out some of the great prose the thru hikers contribute on a daily basis. I guess tenting would be the ultimate goal but as of now Nick isn't even easy in a motel. Whenever there is a journal entry from the places we have been Tyler and I read it and almost always agree with assessments etc. these people are impressive.

We passed a few thru hikers and even passed a vacant tent on the side of a cornfield. The hike itself was nice with an ascent initially and then small ups and down or PUDs if you will. Anyway we got Billy's view and couldn't help but want to be there in another season with no leaves. Nick was singing a Halloween song on the entire route, We reached giants thumb and although impressive it didn't exactly live up to the hyperbole that had proceeded it. Rands view is cool in that there is a field in the middle of the woods and you can see mountains for what seems like forever. Nice but still not the Catskills. Prospect Rock was a really nice view and had a couple of nice break spots. Nick was moving and singing and Tyler was pushing the way he always does. Nick suddenly stopped, bent over and wouldn't move. When he has to go he goes. Luckily he hikes in Depend type underwear and I always have extra. Of course we were going down and there was no great place to change. I changed him and Tyler was lookout. Tyler has coped very well but he is still 11 and would have been embarrassed if someone had come along. We finished we no further incident and Nick took off like nothing had happened. Later Tyler said he saw a shadowy figure and reminded me that Not Finding Bigfoot had done an episode on the Connecticut AT. We reached The Great Falls quicker than expected and took a nice long break. We have a lot of falls in our are and these are really nice and unique. If we lived closer I know we would hang out there on the rocks. We reached the hydroelectric plant and 5 minutes later our trail angel Mom showed up with beverages in hand. She was happy even though her day was not successful. We did stop at a junk bottle guy on the way home and she did pretty well ther. We have on small section and a 7 miler and we are done with Connecticut. It really is a nice state and I thank them for letting us hike. One thing about the AT everyone is nice. They will always smile and say hi and that is really wonderful. Today I went to school and realized the real world is calling. The only good thing is that I do look forward to eating something other than peanut butter sandwiches and pasta.

Last Friday we hiked Peekamoose mountain in the Catskills and let me tell you it was not easy almost 4000 feet in elevation. The views were worthit though as a matter of fact the Catskills and surrounding areas are we're we hiked in August. Minnewaska State Park is awesome with spectacular views, waterfalls and great trails. We set a record with a 12 mile hike. It's a shame we have to go back to school but you know we'll be out on weekends when soccer allows. Today was hot and humid and we would have probably kayaked but the newspaper nj herald conducted an interview and took some pictures. We decided to climb Culvers Gap with its nice views and have Lynne pick us up. She was on time as usual and made money so we celebrated the end of summer at Jumboland. Thru hikers always write that they are pleasantly surprised by the Jumboland experience. We still have 8 miles to complete in Connecticut and that will come very soon. I used poetic license and told the paper we finished so I really want to get it done. For those of you who have written me about autism and different situations well I have a story for you. First embarrassment goes out the window there are just too many situations to worry about. When we went to Peekamoose mountain I forgot Nicks cup and my emergency straw. Well, he drank from a water bottle spilled a tiny bit on his clothes and removed them. Tyler and I tried in vein to get him to wear them. Of course I forgot extra clothes so we hiked from 3500 feet in his special underwear, socks up to his knees an hiking socks. Tyler was nervous about being embarrassed and that is something we are very aware of and do not want this to happen. Luckily we only passed one couple and when we did I wrapped a ground cloth around him. Once we passed he unwrapped and played with it like a cape. He looked like a pro wrestler coming out of the locker room. We made it to the car and everything was ok as I had extra clothes. Anyway an amusing story once its over.

We started with a short rock climb and ha to take a break not a quarter mile in. Nick started crying for no apparent reason but after a drink he was fine. Go figure. We made great time even with the rocks. They are not horrible they just never stop. I had to get back on the trail because I do get white blaze fever. The local sussex county paper did a front page article on our exploits and other than getting my last name wrong it was very good. Many people from near and far have contacted me for various reasons advice etc.   We really do feel normal when we are on the trail.   Pennsylvania gets a bad rap. It is rocky and somewhat boring but the views are nice. A blue blazed side trail led to a spectacular view of farmland with mountains in the distance.

After the newspaper did an article on us we have been recognized by a few people out on the trails. We will probably do NJ again in reverse since it is close to our home. Next summer we will surely travel further to possibly do some miles in every state. If anyone knows of a flea market somewhat near the AT in any state please let me know. Anyway, Lynne dropped us off and proceed to Elephants Trunk Flea Market that is not close. The GPS took her a different way that was treacherous and she was not happy. She had a very successful day of picking so all is well. The start was a nice little woods walk that was very different looking than when we were last here this summer. The climb up Bear Mountain was fun and slow, but by no means impossible. When we arrived there were quite a few people enjoying the great weather and wonderful views. From there it was gradual downhill until we are to the shelter and the stream where we had a nice lunch. Lyons Head is a really cool view and we enjoyed it very much. Later we made it to the trailhead but only after some wrong turns the foliage obscures some blazes. The problem we have is backtracking with Nick is sometimes tough.

With the holiday break and no snow we hiked all over mostly local but had a few longer trips. We hiked much of the AT in New Jersey again as we'll as a few new areas and of course many trails in the Water Gap. We are all decked out in orange and even had a lady wondering if we were hunters. The Pinnacle and Pulpit are popular destinations and we did see quite a few people on the trail. Nick started out whining and giving us a hard time. Tyler and I force him to move and it does not always look good when we do so. I was contemplating turning back but at least wanted to get to the Pulpit. When we did he was like a new kid the rest of the way. We moved over Rocksylvania rocks and then really moved on an old woods road until we broke off on a blue trail to the reservoir. The Pinnacle was spectacular and Tyler commented that PA gets a bad rap this was one of his favorite hikes with some awesome views. We went to Wendy's and Cabelas afterwards and had a great day. Nick was great for the entire trip and you would not realize he started out so badly. We did over 50 miles during the break and want to do as much in the new year. As of now I would like to hike parts of the AT in every state. That will be 2014 goal we shall see if logistics will allow this. Tomorrow we will celebrate the new year with the boys buying boots. I got anew pair og Merrils for Xmas and the have been great. I also got a boot dryer and that is working out well. Another entry I will report on our rather strange Superfund hike.

In December we got to the top and couldn't find the white blazes to continue on they were covered with snow on that side of the mountain. It was humbling and considered a waste to travel that far and have Lynne pick us up at the same spot. It became a ""White Elephant "" of sorts and became even more pronounced after the tough first three months of 2014 forced us to wait until spring. Now we hiked all winter on snowmobile trails or paved back roads. This has actually put us well ahead of last years 500 mile total. Our conditioning is great and we decided it was time to come in from the other direction to connect as an out and back. Well today we connected at a very good pace. Nick was great except for the climb down and back up from what I will call the apex. There was an American Flag that was totally covered in December. We shouted a few choice words and proceeded back. Murphy's Law the only time Nick balked was in front of the only people we really saw all day. People must think that we are torturing the poor kid but after the ascent he literally started running on the grassy section. This was awesome for us, we now have almost finished every section up to Port Clinton and we have plans to do it.

Bake Oven Knob is extremely nice with wonderful views. We ran into only two people during the day and none at the knob. The bake shelter is not that nice. It is one of the oldest on the trail and it shows. Tyler said it was almost as bad as the couple in Harriman state Park in NY. We spoke to a group of section hikers about to embark on a long hike. What was interesting was that after returning home I google the Knob and found information on it being haunted,creepy etc. when I showed Tyler we started filling in the blanks just as all imaginations do. When we arrived at the shelter we thought someone was there but there was not. The same thing happened at the knob. I thought I heard voices and kept looking behind us more often than usual.

He was right on the money with the relative ease and Tyler stated that it was easier than at least 20 other areas that we have encountered in our previous hikes. I will state that it is not something that I would care to tackle in the rain. After that we took a break at the campground and enjoyed all the views throughout the hike especially at the power cut. We made wonderful time and met up with Lynne with energy to spare. We did run into quite a few people mostly Boy Scouts and a few others. We had a brief conversation with a trio of women who were also section hiking and we're interested to learn that we have hiked from this point to Massachusetts..

The temperature was in the 60s and perfect.we hiked over Mt Everett with nice views and then down on slippery rocks from rain the previous night. Next it was on to Race Mountain with fine views and a lot of people. We hiked down to the we Laurel Ridge Campsite. We took a quick break an back up to Race. The hike on the ridge line reminded us of th Kittatiny Ridge here in Jersey. We have hiked that ridge many times and it is very nice with good views. Race is probably even better. The climb back up Mt. Everett was not easy. That is always the problem with an out and back you know what's ahead. Anyway, just as we started to ascend we ran into Crazy Bear, a Minister from Georgia who was on a 10 day hike connecting what he had done in previous years. He has hiked from Springer to Mass. He hiked with us and we had very nice conversation about many different topics focusing mostly on the AT. Tyler was very impressed with him and we were both impressed with the fact that Nick's Autism did not phase him one bit, that is not always the case. Time flew and we were at the parking area before you knew it. We shared a cold water from the cooler and said goodbye. Crazy Bear is a very nice man and Tyler, Nick and I really enjoy nice people. It was a hard hike day that taxed the kids but winter conditioning was able to help us. Crazy Bear commented that we were real hikers with fine pace. This thrilled Tyler to be considered a true hiker. Seeks it had said this area has no easy trail and he is right. I thought getting out of PA was going to be better, it wasn't.

If you are section hiking you should really check out Seeks Its 2012 thru and section hike. He documents ares that come in very handy when we go out. He has commented that the rocks are bad for stretches but are supplemented by old tote road walks that are very welcome albeit somewhat boring. There are some nice views with balanced rocks being a great lunch spot with the lush green Lehigh Valley farmland below. Dans Peak is also extremely nice. PA gets a bad rep it has view it is just that the rocks do take your eyes and demeanor off the views. We are in the process of doing Parts of NJ for the thIrd time with some sections for the fourth or fifth. When you pass Sunfish Pond there really is a wonderful view that being from NJ does make me proud to show that this state is not just urban blight, Jersey shore and Goodfellas. I cross the trail everyday going to work by Joe to Go in Culvers Gap.Jersey rocks are not that much easier than PA it is just the mental aspect that the state is over. After High Point State Park that is really when the trail starts to become more friendly and humane. There are two places where Nicks favorite activities come together in NJ. Kayaking and hiking. One is the Water Gap bridge that feels very different from the walk over it. The other is the bridge next to the Oil City Road in the Wallkill Wildlife refuge. I do think it is technically in NY. These activities connecting are two very fun things for the three of us to do. Our mileage for the year is way ahead of any year previous and the boys seem to be in the best shape ever. Our plans for summer are to kayak in heat and hike somewhat local with AT advancement trips intermingled. Nick has summer school and various treatments specialists etc. have severely limited funds especially for gas. Tyler and I road and mountain bike when we are without Nick so the adventure summers continue. One thing Tyler is really into is leaving trail magic. Whenever we can we leave water at the Rutherford Shelter as there is no water source and it is close to our house.

We have almost all of NJ a few times and have really gotten to know the trail both north and south, especially in the Crater Lake area. Anyway, Kelogg road parking area is a little rough and Tyler always says you have to have four wheel drive to park along the AT. We parked next to a cornfield and the mosquitoes were really bad. We quickly sprayed and went on our way. Of course we went the wrong way and turned around after checking my phone gps. We really had a nice hike that was flat and quick. The only real problem was there weren't any really great break spots without mosquitoes. What was nice was there were all types of woods , swamps and road crossings that kept thing nice we stopped at Shays Rebellion Monument and Tyler and I discussed the historical significance for much of the hike. We turned around at Jugs End Road and made good time this vein an out and back is the reason for choosing flat terrain. The we all types of hikers that we walked by and trail magic near the Monument. Another conversation we had was what type of store we would open along the AT. Antiques is probably not what a thru hiker is looking for and Tyler wants to open a supply store that sells things that are cheaper than they cost. I do not think he will major in business anyway we moved quick had a great low humidity day and were glad to be out of the rocks. We are hoping to get to the Mass interstate by the end of summer maybe staying in a hotel with a pool that Nick loves. One thing we love are the trips to and fro.

The previous Saturday we had a Family Reunion not far and hiked a short 2.5 miles out and back to cut off any extra miles for this hike. Anyway, we really did not want to hike back on all the rocks so we bushwhacked to the game road a mile away. We made it even though Nick balked at the last section with prickers. This was a good idea because the road was flat and pleasant with cloud cover overhead. We hiked at a wonderful pace and reached the Sand Spring Trail that lead across the AT and down to the parking lot. The trail was very rocky(it is PA) after all. It ended up being a figure 8 hike with a record for us 14 miles. After that we ate like pigs a Long John Silvers and went to Cabellas. We got home late and walked a few dirt roads at the Lakehouse and relaxed. Monday we did a local 7 miler in our favorite AT spot the Wallkill Wildlife Refuge. Now we have hiked there 15-20 times in all seasons. After being on the AT we went off to the rail trail section and were shocked by a bear 5-10 feet away in the brush. The bear ran the other way but we did have to return this way. Tyler's hat flew off his head and we couldn't find it on the way back. I knew there was no way a bear had taken it and we finally found it. On our way back we saw another bear cross the trail near the junction with the AT.

It started sprinkling right after the hike and Lynne was able to pick us up under the cover of the picnic shelter. We later went to Antietam Battlefield and had a good time on the driving tour and at Burnsides Bridge. The next day was a totally different story. Stay tuned.","Snowy Mountain Road

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/471895,"Wow, what a simple 6 mile hike that was very eventful. It called for overcast conditions and 50 percent chance of rain. At home we would not have hiked but this being vacation we had to do it. I shortened it to not include part of Maryland. Things started badly GPS had us in woods where there was supposed to be a flea market. After some driving we found it and bookmarked it. We then set off to find Keys Gap. After a small wrong turn we found the trailhead. The sky looked ominous but what the heck. We left Mom and hiked for awhile. Lynne called and said it was pouring buckets where she was. The market because of rain was a washout and she was heading over to Wal-Mart. I should have heeded her warning and gotten prepared suddenly it came. The trees that had been providing decent cover but not in this. We quickly stopped and got out our ponchos. Mind you we had not used them and you get what you pay for. Nick would not keep his on. Tyler ripped his and mine stunk. The backpack was soaked as was the guidebook. I did have the foresight to bring along the waterproof cover that I use for kayaking to cover my phone and watch. Many hikers have written that the trail turns to a river and yes they are not lying we were soaked in what seemed to be a minute. Well we were about a third of the way into it so no use turning around we pushed on. I am sure many can relate but once you are wet, Oh Well! We made good time over some PA type rock sections. We encountered 3 trail runners just before our decent into Harpers Ferry. Their dog scared Nick but all was well. They were nice if not crazy to be running in this monsoon it did seem like they were experienced. Finally the rain started to subside and we passed a couple on their way up and a family also going in the same direction. After we exchanged pleasantries with a section hiker we received a call from Lynne saying she was at the ATC headquarters and it was cool. I said we would be right there and we crossed the bridge over the Shenandoah and came to the detour to the AMC Headquarters. This hike would never end and we finally made it after a relatively long detour. We put our stuff out front and took some pictures with my camera. I did not officially register us as section hikers because we are not sure about Nicks picture being out there yet. Maybe next year when we return from the Maryland side. Anyway Lynne spent money and bought all types of AT paraphernalia for all of us for x-mas. I did put a ""I would rather be hiking the AT"" License plate cover on the adventure vehicle. I spoke to the really nice guys about the trail, hiking Katadin and other info. but Nick was quickly expiring so we had to leave a lot earlier than I wanted to. Oh life with autism. Went to Red Robin and Antietam the next day in what was a great mini vacation. Although we literally hike every weekend the summer is coming to a close and new parts of the AT are getting farther away we will be out there probably more in the Catskills for now.","Keys Gap

On a beautiful day sunny, low 60's Lynne dropped us off at the trailhead on Route 183 and we progressed southbound. Immediately we passed the fort marker we were following the usual PA tote road type trail with annoying rocks but nothing that slowed us down. We stopped for lunch at a beautiful overlook and had it all to ourselves. Later we went by other great views and it got crowded with what appeared to be a church group possibly Quakers who came to the overlook from a different route. PA really has nice views and relatively easy ridge walks. There is always a quarter mile or so that slows you down with rocks etc. Nick also slowed us down for a quarter mile stretch or so by suddenly pointing out and touching every white blaze. He does this periodically and then stops. The day before we hiked the Wallkill Refuge close to our home and he pointed out blazes for a while. Autism really is a puzzle. Later he removed a branch across the path just the way you and I would do it. The puzzling part is why he decided to do that one in so much that it was not obtrusive and he has walked around and over literally thousands over the years. We met Lynne and went to Red Robin in Hamburg next to Cabellas. They have gluten free fries and are extremely accommodating to our request for a booth in a corner with no one behind us for him to bother. Lynne has been on alert because of the recent human killing by a bear in a preserve not far from our house. We actually hiked there this time last year. Tyler is always talking so I am really not too worried. We are hoping to do more AT miles soon and really do some hiking throughout the winter.

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477977,A hike that I had wanted to do for quite a bit. Our goal is to go from the Virginia border to Vermont. This hike has now enabled us to box in the gaps and fill them in. Here in NJ we have teachers convention and two days off. I used to attend but once you have children it is time to keep them occupied and we hike. Thursday was rain but Friday looked good. At least around here. We got an early start and the three of us got off. We went up the NY Thruway and exited in Albany. Tyler commented on the big buildings and how he likes nature so much better. We found the trail crossing easily but were confused about parking. After driving around a bit we parked in the back of the Stop and Shop parking area. Was not really sure if we were allowed but tried anyway and upon returning everything was good. We walked down the road with our fall bright orange on crossed the two walking bridges and were on our way. Driving up it started to drizzle and there was impressive frost on Mount Greylock and others with quite abit of fog. As we hiked the drizzle turned to sleet and then snow. We were impressed and well prepared especially we a blue blazed trail called Bad Weather Bypass. We used that on the way down but did the rock scramble Northbound. It was not anything horrible but being wet was a slow go. After that we passed two side trails and the snow was really coming down. I got a tad worried that it might get bad and getting down and driving home might be treacherous. Well we did not come this far so Tyler said we must carry on. Nick was wet unhappy and giving us a hard time. We finally reached the border in the middle of the woods. The often photographed sign area reminded me of the intersection of the Long Path AT in Harriman State Park. There is just nothing around in the middle of the forest. I signed in the book in the journal and mentioned this site as I never know what to write and couldn't dawdle. We took a quick break and headed back down the mountain. It snowed maybe an inch or so and the blazes were somewhat difficult to follow. On the way back we just followed our previous trail. Nick was very difficult probably because he was uncomfortable we hiked locally every day this weekend and he was fine. We finally made it to the car in the darkness. The views on the way down were surreal and lookin up from route 2 was neat as darkness fell. We spent about 15 20 minutes heating the car and changing. Nick looked so happy under his blanket. The drive home was in snow showers with the temperature hovering near freezing. When we hit the Thruway it was as if there was a proverbial wall with no more rain/snow and dry roads. We stopped at the Taco Bell/Long John Silvers in Hudson NY and ate like kings. Nick ate his special food and was now very happy. We arrived home after a treat for Tyler at Dairy Queen at 930. I gave Nick his bath and Tyler and I showered and we went to bed feeling very satisfied that we had done a step of the AT in another state.

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479777,We took Nick to a Hotel with apocolyses as part of his X mas present. This led us to Chambersburg with antiques for Mom and hiking for us. Actually hiked SOBO and really moved. Much like other parts of PA it follows old tote roads and well worn trails for good speed. There were relatively few rocks compared to northern parts of PA and it was mostly downhill. Quarry Gap Shelter is a wonderful place and very well maintained. It was as good as reputed. Two days before we had hiked Harriman in NY and stopped by some of those early shelters so what a difference. Nick had an accident but we were able to take care of it with very little problems. We ended at Calendonia and met Mom who had a successful day. Nick then got his gluten free fries at Red Robin and really seemed to have a great time. He swam in the hotel pool and really loved it. Today's haircut was another story. I will try to do more new trail soon but it now takes more planning. Pennsylvania is a good possibility in 2015 as well as Massachusetts. We will see. We did over 700 miles in 2014 and have done almost all of NJ and some of NY on the AT. We love the trail areas close to home and use many side trails that lead to it. It also keeps us in AT shape. I seriously doubt there is any trail within a 30 mile radius of our house that we have not done. Other trails are good but there is nothing like the AT. We went up to Mombasha high point and through the Lemon squeezers and it is really neat to go back a couple years later to get a different appreciation when you are not as pressed for time and not meeting a ride. I will submit new entries when we do new AT trail.,"Caledonia State Park

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/487226,"For the longest time Swatara Gap had been a goal. It seemed to be the middle of PA and something that was not obtainable. Well we did it we a relatively flat hike that started in a dusting of snow and had cold wind chills to boot. We stopped at the shelter and have really been impressed with PA shelters. Our pace was really quick and we noted that there were some nice views with no leaves. PA as noted by ""Seeks it"" is really a series of tote/woods roads with short but sometimes tough rocky sections. The roads can be boring and there are not as many lakes and ponds that break up other areas. Anyway we descended to Swatara Gap and went under Route 81 to the old iron bridge where we met Lynne and went to Cabellas and Red Robin. Nick has had more Turets type outbursts lately that can be embarrassing but most people are understanding. Nick looks perfectly normal so I think it is surprising to some. On the trail he sings but overall makes very little noise at all.","Rt. 501

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/487382,"For the second Easter in a row we hiked. First time in shorts as the weather was excellent. There really is not any hiking weather better than hiking in the 50s. We drove down to Chambersburg after my fathers surprise 80th birthday party. We all swam in the pool and got an early start even though Nick had a bad night. We always say that we do not come all this way to let something like lack of sleep stop us. Lynne dopped us off at the intersectio of Canada Hollow and Ridge Road. We hiked northbound with the topography promising to be flat with a final downhill. This would help accomplish the miles. As stated in previous entries we hiked all winted and our stamina is good. Much of this hike was just like much of PA wide old tote type roads almost railtrails with rocks and roots strewn in. The rocks are not like the ones that give PA its reputation north of Swatara Gap. Anyway, we took abreak at the first shelter Birch Run and had a quick snack. I keep track of our pace using my GPS watch and we were making great time. We later stopped at Toms Run Shelters and snacked at the picnic pavillion. Really nice job repairing the shelters in a very nice open area. Not far after that we reached the official halfway point of the AT. I ttok many picture trying to get Nick to look at the camera. With Tylers always welcome help I accomplished this. We passed the site of Camp Michaux a WWII prisoner camp that thrilled Tyler. We reached Pine Grove Furnace and found Lynne already there. She struck out somewhat but did find a few treasure and had reached there early and went into the museum already buying stickers and postcards. Lynne stayed with Nick who was pretty spent in the car and Tyler and I went into the museum. The store was openingnthe next weekend so the Half Gallon will have to wait. The museum is cool and I will visit again. We really are spoiled wiyh modern hiking paraphernalia compared to the early trail pioneers. Chuck Ts for 2000 mile I probably couldnt get 2. The man and woman in the museum were wonderful. Lynne had already filledmthem in on us and they even gave a pin for Nick. They both had Jersey ties and we could have talked for hours. Nick was expiring so we left with the promise of another vist. We went to Red Robin and Nick got his fries and only made small commotion. The next day we had to connect ashort section from route16 to Old Forge Picnic area. The weather was awesome 70 and sunny. We moved quickly and had time so we hung out at the Antetam shelter with Tyler wading in the brook. Lynne picked us up with success and we proceeded to the Army Heritage Museum Trail in Carlisle. Lynne found some good shops etc. and Tyler loved the museum. We are going to come back and the promise of finishing PA is now reality. One last thing Michaux State Forest is acool area.

When we arrived we crossed the Mass. Pike and signed the register at the top of a relatively short climb. Tyler threw rocks through the remaining ice on Upper Goose pond and we made good time getting to Goose Pond Road. We took a short break on the telephone pole bridge and contined our way back. We detoured on the blue blazed side trail to Upper Goose Pond shelter. It is a really neat place and even though it was closed we were impressed. We went to the dock area and took a snack break with Tyler wading. From there the fun really began. Nick started balking and really seemed tired like he wanted to sleep. We kept picking him up and he walked for a short bit and then flopped down. This is really unprecedented so we pushed him to the top. He balked for the better part of a mile and then out of nowhere leaned over and vomited. He had not eaten much and I found residue of a rhododendron leaf. We have a really hard time getting him to eat vegetables so this was a complete surprise. He got to the car and immediately fell asleep. We stopped at Taco Bell Long John Silvers and I went in to order. Nick awoke but wanted to do with his special diet food. We got home showered him and he fell asleep. The next day it was as if nothing happened. We did a local hike on the McDade Trail for flat miles and actually set our personal group speed record. Autism is really a puzzle. We did not see him even pick a leaf although we had seen it in the past. Overall we did have a good time and would like to get PA and Mass.

We went to the Cumberland Valley and stayed in a hotel with a pool for Nick. Lynne had her destinations mapped out and she dropped us off on route 94. Not a good place for drop off or pickup. The hike was beautiful with wonderful temperatures and scenery. We pass quite a few hikers and took a break at the shelter. We made it to the Pine Grove General store and Lynne was not there yet. We went inside to get the lowdown on the ice cream challenge. The three people inside could not have been nicer. They explained, warned and accepted the fact that Tyler was going to try it alone. Once I explained that we are section hikers the challenge was accepted. Tyler started out great as he did not eat anything all day. After he broke the spoon Nick and I got him a new one and ordered some fries. Lynne showed up after a good day and we decided to eat. Tyler was slowing but still moving. There we a few thru hikers the but we usually keep to ourselves because we are not even close to being in their league. The food is great. I highly recommend eaten there. Tyler slowed and was very close to finishing. I pushed him and he called me a ""wrestling"" father pushing for success. He finished and then got his extra cup to complete the challenge. He finished said he would never eat ice cream again and looked sick. Five minutes later he wanted fries. Teenage metabolism!!! We wrote in the log book that he aced it and wanted fries, really just tongue in cheek.

On Sunday Lynne dropped us off on 94 and we quickly hiked north. Not long after we came to a rock maze that was really cool. One of my favorite places so far on the AT. Later after some ups and downs we took a break at the shelter. I always sign in because you would not believe how many people do not believe that we have been there and done that with a severely Autistic child. We passed the former mid point of the trail and descended to fields. The week before we had hiked elsewhere and picked up some ticks. Tyler had his trepidation but we sprayed and moved through the hot sun. We the passed a very holiday parade crowded children's Lake we sat at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Regional Headquarters. I got water and Nick was swing on the porch swing. Lynne was running late so I went inside and looked around. It is a really nice place, smaller than Harpers Ferry, but nice. The woman was pleasant and busy. Later a woman and her young daughter came in inquiring about hiking both thru and section. The staff member brought her out to hear about our somewhat unique section hiking. I explained Nicholas and his Autism and how Lynne drops us off and finds antique deals. Also how we have completed three states and have done three quarters of PA and Mass. She was interested thanked us and left.

Signs for the AT are on both sides and there was a parked car right next to the trail. Research showed that there was no pull off and parking but there really is room for quite a few. Not sure if it is allowed. This was our type of hike. We walked through fields with lots of bug spray and gnats circling around our heads. After crossing Route 850 into the woods and eventually up. Nick always balks at up hills because he won't look down. This always makes it seem longer for all of us. When we reached the top there is a nice cut out with a short walk to views. PA has views it is just what is in between that is well boring. The next stretch from there to Hawks Rock is bland. Relatively flat and rocky with nothing to really see that has not been seen before. When we do not travel we are hiking locally and there is much more to see just in High Point where we were the day before. Humid and cool the miles went quickly and we reached the Cove Mountain Shelter blue trail. Guide books etc said 500 feet to .10 of a mile downhill. We started down but Nick would have been a problem coming back up. We skipped up and continued along to Hawks Rock. Really nice view after strange trail jut that we had to redo because we consider ourselves purists I guess. We passed a nice couple who asked about wher we had come from. They said how far does the trail go and I responded Georgia and then explained how we got dropped off and how there is not much to see at least immediately. We went down and passed quite a few day hikers who commented on how steep the trail was. When we reached the bottom we street walked into Duncannon. We got a little lost but saw some thru hikers and followed them to The Doyle Hotel. Lynne met us there. We got a picture and left stopping at Cabellas on the way home.

Of course Nick was up at night and we got a later start. We also hit road construction traffic. Murphy's Law is usually the rule when dealing with Autism and plans. Anyway, it was hot and humid but overcast. We hiked up second mountain and were sweating profusely. We passed some camp kids and day hikers as well as thru hikers. The heat stunk but I was really proud of our conditioning. Tyler is becoming more mentally strong as he matures. His motto is""we didn't travel this far to turn around or do only 3 miles"" and the quote here that 7 miles in a city is not the same as 7 miles on the AT. Nick balks at hills always looking up he continues but gives a little bit of a hard time. The other side is more of a gradual slope like a slide on a playground. Going back Nick did not balk and we made good time. We came to Rausch Gap and the ruins of an old village . There were signs explaining how they were reclaiming the polluted stream. Tyler is a real history buff and he loves deserted things so this was right up his alley. We went to the shelter and it has the best access trail that I have encountered. Usually it is up or downhill and the mileage does not match. This is on an old flat road. The shelter is cool. It is built on an old foundation and has a spring that leads to a gutter. I wrote in the book and a fellow came up. He has hiked for a few weeks many summers and is going to our haunts High Point State Park. We wished him well and visited the old cemetery. We troweled of and changed at the car and went to Wendy's and Cabellas before getting home late. Great day and really has me thinking about finishing PA before the end of the year.

When we go to Highpoint State Park we stop at the lake near the end and grab a snack at the concession stand. We have talked to thru hikers before but today we spoke to three and gave some preview of the trail that is yet to come. One of them Airlock is on Trailjournals and she mentioned our preview being spot on and Tyler was really impressed because he has hiked the trail with me all the times we have done it. All three were extremely pleasant and we really had so many more questions. Anyway, because Nick is not the camping type so far we have to do daily travels to do new trail. Today we went by Finnerty Pond near Lee Massachusetts. We parked on county road and actually went the wrong way because I was looking for a flat section. Realizing my mistake we continued on because we had to do this section anyway. There is something about New England that is different in a good way and I just can't put my finger on it. Tyler spotted what he thought was Moose scat that he had seen on North Woods Law. I was skeptical but the area does have the look of areas that you see Moose in. We did not see one but, sure enough I looked it up online and they have been spotted in the area. Maybe not recently but, you never know. The hike was beautiful and the weather perfect. We passed at least 15 thru hikers who are always nice and I never feel that I should slow them down by chatting. We have been hiking quite a bit of PA and let me tell you Massachusetts is not easy. Sure there are rocks and mud but, the real culprit are the roots. We stumbled multiple times and our MPH time according to my watch is slower than PA. What Mass doesn't have are breather areas or many of them. In the other states that we have done there are tote roads or railroad beds that allow you to make up time and even look at a map/guidebook without stumbling. Even with this it is still beautiful and our conditioning is excellent. We drove with Nick singing and stopped to get food at Taco Bell/ Long John Silvers in Hudson NY.

Gas always takes up a big chunk. Anyway, I checked the forecast for Lee and it was supposed to rain in the morning and then a window with rain late afternoon. There were clouds the ride up and some signs of rain. When we got to County Road there was a spritz on the windshield. We hiked anyway because when you travel you can't just go home. Well we were about ten minutes in heard thunder and the heavens opened up. We had this happen last August in Harpers Ferry and learned a lot. We had everything covered and had learned from a fellow at the AT Headquarters in HArpers Ferry that when it's warm just embrace the rain. We did and Nick loved it. We were passed by a few hikers who we met up with at the October Mountain Shelter. The rain had subsided by the time we reached the shelter so we continued on. Our original goal was to go further but all things considered we stopped at Pittsfied Road and turned around. Sometimes it is nice to do the trail again in a different direction. We took a picture of the shelter. I didn't sign the book and continued on. While walking we encountered a hiker ""All the Way"". He was a hiker who we met in High Point State Park a week and a half ago on one of Our biking trips while Nick is in school. He was just as surprised to see us. Nick didn't stop so our conversation was short. He is a very nice guy who seemed just as curious about our section hiking as anything. Tyler seemed to think it gives us validity. I do not know about that but it was cool. After we returned to the car we stripped off the wet clothes and went to Old Country Buffet. It seems a bit pricey but is fun once in awhile and headed home. A fun day all around. One thing Tyler hates are crowded areas. Maybe it is spending so much in the woods. We stopped at a NY Thruway rest area. And it is like a mini Grand Central Station.

Had a great day, Lynne started with trepidation that she would have little to do and even though there is Pittsfield nearby 5 hours of retail with no money equates to wasted day. On our way up the Thruway we made great time passing so many huge RV type trailers from Quebec. They really seem to know how to live up there. Anyway, we passed a antique shop and a tag sale that I bookmarked. I later found out that Lynne had success at the Salvation Army and Goodwill and wants to go again. This is crucial for our finishing Massachusetts. The hike itself was fun. For the second time in three weeks there was a downpour early on that stopped as soon as we got to Warner Hill. There were great views and we saw Greylock. We also met Thru-hiker Paradox who chatted with us briefly. She was impressed with Nick. You really do meet many great people hiking. The hike was relatively easy and we came into town and stopped at Sweet Peas ice-cream shop. It was good. We hiked down the sidewalk and Tyler noted that it is like Duncannon. Nick actually slowed up. I really think that he has an aversion to streets. Lynne picked us up and we quickly changed because the mosquitos were horrible at the trailhead. We chowed at Wendy's and was home by 8. Nick was limping slightly. It must have been nothing because he hiked 9 miles on the McDade Trail Sunday. A great family day! On a side note: Tyler and I have been bike riding 3 times a week while Nick is in Summer school. Once a week we bike High Point State Park and eat at the stand next to Lake Marcia. I have spoken to all kinds of Thru Hikers there and since we have hiked the NJ AT so many times given some advice if they wanted it.

The stile at the end of the field was not only unique to us but dangerous to a child especially an Autistic one. The barbed wire was rusty and exposed and Nick almost caught himself on it. After this the boardwalk is nice if not a bit dilapidated and rickety. We climbed Bald Mountain and were sweating. We took a break at the marked spring and even filtered the water with our Lifestraw.

It cleared up when we got to the trailhead. It was humid on the climb and I realized we forgot a straw for Nick. He won't drink out of a bottle but Tyler cut the end of a pen and we had a straw that worked well.

The funny thing is these rocks are well known as the ones that AWOL sprained his ankle on. The forest got dark and the temperature lowered. The lightning flashes illuminated the woods. The situation in kind of cool exceptI am responsible for two kids one Autistic. In all my years of camps and class trips as soon as you hear thunder you head for cover. Not an option as the storm lightning wise was never really near but the rain started. We are well prepared for this. After the rocky section it was relatively easy hiking as long as you kept up with the blazes. We arrived at Pen Mar where we had been a year and a half ago. Lynne arrived after pulling into a driveway by following the GPS. She thought the owners were going to get a shotgun. Later we went to a Quiznos , one of our favorite places.

We encountered quite a bit of history both on the trail and on our visit to Monocacy. Lynne had a wonderful trip that was very productive.   She dropped us off at Gathland State Park in front of the War Memorial and we started southbound. The bugs in the park were horrible but non existent on the trail. The trail had rocks but not the type that slow you down. We made great time and stopped at the shelter for a quick break. Nice shelter funny hiker graffiti that had Tyler laughing. We make great time and made it to Weaverton Cliffs. There is a nice view similar to Mount Tammany in the Water Gap and Anthonys Nose at Bear Mountain. We made better than 3 mile per hour pace on the CO canal then over the bridge into Harpers Ferry. We got momentarily lost but made it to Jefferson Rock and then the ATC Headquarters. I did not get our official picture last year but I did this year. Lynne picked us up and we went to Golden Coral.

This is huge because this area to Rausch Gap is our last in PA. She is interested in going again.   We stopped at the convenience store by the Doyle. You have to buy something if there is a store on the trail. After meeting Lynne we went for great ice-cream at 3B. Big portions for reasonable price.

We are really getting close to completing PA and Mass.. I am hoping to have these plus Maryland completed by this time next year. I brought my old Ford Explorer all the way out to Cold Spring Road through Fort Indiantown Gap. Everything I had read said rough road well it was. As we started to descend there were big rocks and large washouts. We only went a short way and I got nervous so we turned around and parked at the top. The hike down was steep and I was glad I did not drive the whole way. After a mile and a quarter we reached an old railroad Trail/ Carriage Road. We turned right and proceeded to the junction with the AT toward Rausch Gap Shelter. Where we had left off July 6. We loaded up on water at the shelter in the rain gutter spring. Then we hiked and made great time. After visiting Yellow Springs Village we took the trail down to the RR trail. The guidebook said the trail was not recommended but we found it to be a PA trail with rocks, rock fields and streams. It was cool because out of nowhere came a stream the had rust colored water or really at the base. Then it would disappear and reappear clean. Really neat and it kept Tyler's interest. We completed the big rectangle and finished with the big walk up. Our time for 13.5 miles was excellent as we were in the 3 MPH neighborhood for much of the trip and even under 2 on the way up.

The 3 of us kayaked over 70 miles of the Delaware River and of course hiked. We were going to the lake house for the weekend so we wanted one final big trip to culminate the summer. We chose Mount Greylock and a southbound ascent of the mountain. I was really surreal to think that the previous Friday we were in Harpers Ferry some 500 miles south of where we were hiking. The weather was wonderful and we knew that the first 2 miles were the especially tough ones. Tyler and I put our heads down and would not let Nick balk at the steep ascents. We pushed and made it to the first view relatively quickly. When we went back later we realized how steep it was. The great views were awesome and we quickly made it to Notch Road. From there we moved at a good pace and then climbed the final steep ascent to the summit. We looked at the great views and took some nice pictures then went to the lodge. It was expensive (2.25 for a 12ounce can of soda) and not the most inviting. Older people really have very little tolerance for severely autistic. There we plenty of people on the mountain enjoying the beautiful day . When we do an out and back hike we want to go back the easiest way possible. In this case it was the road. We made good time and got back to the initial great views and took a break. We got back to the car quickly and really had a wonderful sense of accomplishment.

As we defended it lightened up and the forest is really beautiful. The leaves were just starting to change. We took at break at a great overlook that had been cut out with a chainsaw and ate lunch. After that we decended some more and made it to the bottom. We passed a flip flop thru-hiker named 3 bears and we chatted briefly about Katahdin and summiting. We passed the cheese press and went to Diane's Twist. The lady there was a character and told us that Sunday was to be the last day that they were open. Tyler ate ice-cream and we met Lynne.

We are really getting near our goal of PA and Mass. We got up early and left even earlier than usual because it now gets dark by 5 and hiking with an Autistic child in the woods of PA with the rocks is not inviting. Anyway we arrived at the big parking lot with only one other car. as a matter of fact we did not see another person on the entire hike until we were back at the lot. The trail rose about 1000 feet in the first couple of miles. It used old tote mining roads to make it very pleasant. The leaves were fallen and in such rapid succession sounded like rain. The reservoir came into view and it was extremely nice to see. We stopped at the terminus of the Horshoe trail and sat on the cool seats by the old fire tower. From there we really moved until we came to the Yellow spring trail. We took a nice break with a great sense of accomplishment.

Even though we wear orange and hunters are not going to shoot on purpose. I never feel comfortable when seeing hoards of orange and hearing gunshots. During rifle season we try to go to local preserves and places where hunting is not allowed. Anyway we got an early start and got up to Mass. and Jerusalem road. It was chillier than we thought , but we were prepared. We met two overnight hikers being dropped off at the same time and we chatted then left. The cobble afforded a nice view of the surrounding area and we saw two other hikers in the distance. After passing the Shaker campsite the AT started to climb. The problem with this time of year is the blazes are easy to see, but the path is covered with leaves that make the roots and rocks slippery. We trudged up with some slipping a little annoyed because mentally I did not have us as prepared as I did recently in PA. Tyler and I have the look down and move hard up and over mentality. Nick on the other hand, balks. One of us has to push him both literally and figuratively. The trail leveled out when we reached the border of Beartown and we had a nice 51 degree overcast fall walk to Beartown Road. It was exactly 5 miles and we turned around and took a nice break at the footbridge in the picture. My students love these hot chips called Takis so I show them pictures from our weekend adventures with Tyler eating some. We spoke with the guys again and headed back.

Many rocks, lots of rock overhangs and nice views on both sides of the ridge with no leaves on the trees. We made decent time as I was worried about my shin. The previous week we were near the Catskills and hiked to Rainbow Falls in Minnewaska State Park. It is very wet near the falls and my boot slipped. The nub of a branch was on the log and ripped my shin. I stopped the bleeding with all the paraphernalia that Tyler stocks the backpack with. He was as proud as a peacock when the doctor stated that it was such a clean cut. I could see tendon and bone, but could not panic as we had 5 miles to hike back to the car.

Lynne met us at a recreation park just on the other side of the Route 81 bridge. It was a good thing because we were nasty. The last part of the hike from the Scott Work Center is through a cow pasture. It has rained a lot lately and we had to be purists and hike the trail. It was not pleasant.

There is very little about the AT in NJ that I do not know. if anyone needs some info let me know.

I always strike up a conversation and inform them of what is coming up etc.. Anyway, we have hiked not only the AT, but twice every weekend throughout this winter. Only once were we able to bring the sled and snowshoes and do our winter stuff. We did not get a lot of snow in Northern NJ in January when the area near the coast was bombarded. We we up towards the Catskills and hiked because they had no snow at all. There also was one frigid Saturday that we sat out, but with Monday off we hiked twice that weekend. We did start out at one degree on that Sunday we do however, have all of the paraphernalia and were not cold at all. I was extremely cold on Surise Mountain on one trip that We left quickly or I am sure frostbite would have set in.

The trail was great and Lynne was able to pick us up after successful shopping, The AT Parking website is wonderful and we have and will continue to keep using it as we journey on. The history was amazing with many monuments and signs all along this section. On the way home we stopped at Gettysburg, but this lesser celebrated area is less commercial and more impressive. Tyler commented on the fact that Maryland had both Revolutionary ties as well as Civil War. The trail itself is probably the easiest of the 6 states we have traversed. This is not to say that it is a rail-trail. It has great views and some nice forests. There are a couple of sections that are Rocksylvania type and some nice tote roads that make travel rapid. The history is second to none. New Jersey is probably next for easiest trail and these are the two states that a person planning a big hike should probably train on. I am hoping to do some of Virginia in the spring and summer and Vermont in August. We would like to complete exactly 1/3 of the trail and then hike the borders in all the states.

Lynne dropped us off a Keys Gap where we last left off over a year ago. She went to the outlets and shops in Leesburg.    Hiking all year round is really helpful. We passed quite a few people of all types and Nick was cranky which happens especially as we pass individuals. On Sunday he was awesome. Anyway, we were getting near the end and we encountered quite a few emergency workers who were dealing with an injured individual. We descended to the Trail center and there were more individuals and emergency vehicles all over. Later we saw a helicopter performing the emergency rescue. At the center we met two extremely nice ladies who are the caretakers. The gave us cold sodas and water and after talking to us were very interested in our story of hiking with a severely Autistic child. One of the ladies was actually from my old haunts in NJ close to the city. There is a chance that I pumped her gas back in the eighties. Small World!!! We took picture and I left my information and we walk d down the dirt road to meet Lynne. We knew that it would be a madhouse when the rescuers were about to leave. Lynne is a veteran of dirt rough trailheads, but even she was surprised by the rough parts and the fact that she was being pushed by a rescue worker behind her. After the pick up we went to 5 Guys and ate. It was good Nick did not digest the fries very well. We went to the hotel and swam in the pool. Nick and Tyler loved it.  On Sunday I decided that with the heat we would hike a little flatter trail and save the ""Roller Coaster"" for the future. Lynne dropped us off at the Trillium Trailhead in the Thompson Wildlife Preserve and hiked to Ashby's Gap. We stopped at Dick's Dome and chatted with a nice hiker named Doc. The hike was really good and as I said before Nick was great. We flew and after a tough highway crossing( Nick does not always want to run when there is and opening and it can be a bit harrowing) we hiked up to the trailhead and waited for Lynne who had a successful day in Winchester and Strasburg. We swam and made our way home the next day. Our plan is to return for a weekend this summer before our vacation to Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire.

Had a problem finding county road and then found it but turned around about 100 feet before the AT crosses it. We were determined so we finally found it and I retrieved the car and parked in the little area by the crossing. The last half mile or so was rough, but not impossible. Next time we will know. Anyway, the hike south was easy except Nick was not happy. He was whiney and at times Tyler and I felt like we were marching a prisoner. it is not unprecedented and we had the same situation last week in the Catskills at 4000 feet. Well we do not travel far to let Autism stop us so we trudged on and on the way back he was fine for the most part. We took pictures at the border took a break and hiked back.

Today we hiked a local 7.5 mile out and back from Deckertown Road to Sunrise Mountain. We went to Sunrise in February and the wind was whipping. It had to be -10 degree windchill and I was worried that Nick would get cold and not let me know. He refuses to wear gloves or a hat. I have two extra large sweatshirts and jackets that cover his hands and he will put the hoods over his head as long as they are not tight. I also cannot look at the pavilion and not think of the suicide that Odyssa encountered in 2005. The rafters built by the CCC could hold an elephant. They are not high. Maybe I am morbid. Anyway we encounter a few day hikers and tru-hikers as well as a mother/daughters section hikers who were extremely nice. We gave them cold water and after talking asked about Rocksylvania. Tyler had mentioned that todays section really reminded us of PA. Our heads are always down and it is a Green Tunnel. For those of you that may not know the rocks stop after the High Point shelter and it becomes flat, easy open field trail for many miles. We have now hiked this state so many times we are becoming somewhat of authorities on the subject. My goal this summer is to see if Nick will sleep in a tent or at least hang out in one. This would really change our whole strategy as we are really at the limits of new trail day hikes. Vermont has two sections that have no access. One 21 miles the other 17.

She dropped us off at County Road at the spot before it got rougher. We hiked down the road and hit the trail with a steady vertical immediately. It was humid and the mosquitos/flys etc. came out. We had Nick carrying a small backpack that held extra shirts, water and sandals. We want to have him start pulling his weight. Except for one time where he put his bag down for no apparent reason he wore it and did not really complain. We passed two Beaver Ponds and stopped at Consultation Peak. the bugs got bad so we left and Tyler put on his head net. We made great time and spoke briefly to a very nice Thru hiker ""Verge"". The shelter area was full , but other than packs and hiking paraphernalia no one was around. Tyler thought it was a Zombie Apocalypse and all they ate were hikers. We took a break at the stream down from the alive hikers and made our way up to Harmon Hill. We stopped and signed the falling apart register and looked at the nice view of Bennington. We could not find the Bennington Monument , but saw it later on our drive out. We then made our way down the mountain. At first it is a nice easy woods trail, but then it gets steep and slow for at least a half mile. Phone reception was non existent, so I thought we would be early for our pick-up time. Well, we were actually late it was slow and steep and a killer on the knees. We kept looking up and rewarding on how we were happy not to be a SOBO today. It reminded me of Pinwheel Vista/Stairway to Heaven near our house. This is harder and it must be murder in wet weather. I spied our car in the lot before the bottom. We passed a person giving out trail magic. I always feel awkward about these situations because hikers really need the food and beverages and we do not because we had cold drinks etc. in the car 50 yards away. Lynne had a decent outing and would like to return in August. Our big dilemma is the next section is 22 miles or so and the most we have ever done is 16 and that was a lot flatter than Vermont.

This helps with nick because the on thing you can count on is inconsistency.   Lynne dropped us off in the crowded Route 4 parking lot and we proceeded north. Not long after a nice and easy ascent we arrived at Maine Junction. Then the fun began. Soon after passing the old junction we passed by thru-hikers Castaway and Turtle. She had fallen, but we found out later that she was O.K. As we started going down. We encountered a father and son blocking the trail and looking at something in their hands. This guy was probably younger than me and out of shape with new paraphernalia that showed of no use. After the normal greeting I had to say excuse me and this guy answered ""well I guess we should move it is not like we won't pass them in 10 minutes"" He then proceeded on moving an foot or two literally and i passed. As Nick went by with Tyler he slipped and pushed into the guy. The guys face looked to kill. I quickly apologized and his response was "" well it is not like we are on the edge of a 1000 foot cliff or something!"" It was high, but not treacherous. We moved on and after about 100 yards Nicked balked and sat down not wanting to move. As this happened here came Mr Happy and his embarrassed looking son. We MOVED to the side and he had a look like why are you bringing a retard on the trail. Humbled and infuriated they went by and seconds later Nick wanted to move. Nick is recovering and he really moves on downhills, so we were catching up. Not wanting to get near this moron we took a break. That is when Castaway and Turtle stopped by and we chatted. They were really nice and remembered High Point New Jersey where we live. They liked NJ and I explained that I grew up near the city and did know Goodfella and Jersey Shore types the majority of the people are not like this. The part of the state that the AT goes through is really similar to the first half of Vermont. I think the Water Gap and Green Mountains were established at the same time. We continued into Gifford Woods, over a nice bridge and around a nice pond. Later we went by a waterfall that was not flowing fast since there had been no rain and across a wonderful boardwalk . Lynne arrived and was excited about a couple of places in the Rutland area. The day was awesome and really had everything a short hike could have. One bad apple should not spoil the whole bunch and we did not let it.","Route 4 near Killington

We wanted to do a short hike to start working our way from the other end of Vermont. It was an absolutely perfect day. Temperatures were in the 60's and we wore sweatshirts which we love. Lynne dropped us off at the top of Elm Street and we road walked down and under the highways to the border on the Connecticut River. Then a short walk later and we were in a different world. The hustle and bustle of Hanover made for a surreal AT experience. We got a little lost and hung out in the Green to get our bearings. Then when we got walking we stopped for a soda and walked next to the football field. We met Lynne at the COOP where she reported a good yet short day. She wanted to come back on our way back in a couple of days. After this we drove to Gorham and stayed at the Royalty Inn. We ate pizza. I got in a workout at the gym and the boys and I swam in the indoor pool. After that the boys swam again in the outdoor pool even though the temperature had to be 50. The water was warm, but not when you get out. People were good-naturedly commenting on them being crazy etc. We saw many hikers who also commented. These two are like fish. I doubt a day goes by in the summer that these two do not swim. Either river, lake, creek or pool they are always in. They quickly once inside the room and went to bed.

Lynne dropped us off and we road walked down the road, across a bridge and down the road. While we were walking a fellow shouted at us from his porch. He warned us that the cars move fast and there is a blind spot so we should stay far to the left of the white line. This is actually good to know because I have to hold Nick's hand on roads. I thanked him and he asked if we were from Chicago. I said no, New Jersey. He responded that we had a very good-looking group. We were flattered and continued on. One thing Vermont does not have is easy trail. This wasn't hard, but you were sweating. We stopped at the shelter for a short break and met an extremely happy Lynne who found some great places and stated we need bigger car. Well that is the goal for next year. We stopped at Dan and Whits and passed Brave Turtle and Castaway who were leaving in a group. They did not see us. This place is what is advertised it has everything.

Now was the time to go a little shorter and tackle a climb. During the year we literally hike every weekend. I record all hikes, but only write journals for new Appalachian Trail. We hike favorite parts of Connecticut and New York with Lynne when she goes to two favorite spots Elephant's Trunk Flea Market and Stormville New York. We also Hike Northern PA when she goes to Saylorsburg Flea Market.   When she does not come with us we hike trails on our own within an hour or so of our house. We like to do loops instead of out and back type hikes. Therefore, there are parts of the NJ AT that we have hiked over 25-30 times. The Catskills are really nice also. Anyway I don't journal about these hikes. When we hike I like to go between 6-10 miles with 5 being the least. I have gotten a glimpse of what it is like to hike everyday many days in a row so I have been adjusting our mileage.. Nick has held up well and is getting stronger. We went by a thru hiker on Mad Tom Notch Road and Lynne asked if she wanted a bottle of water on the way back. She appreciated it, but said there was no garbage at the top of the mountain and had no way of disposing of it. We hiked uphill a passed a fair number of hikers going north. I asked if they were going to Maine and they responded Canada. I forgot that we were also on the Long Trail. We passed a group of about 20 kids and teachers who stood to the side to let us pass. What a difference from the jerk we encountered the other day. At the top we took pictures and admired the view. Our last name is Brahm so there is the extremely creative Brahm's at Bromley. I do have an english degree) When the students arrived coming northbound was another group and they all were together. There was a small bus on either end , so I figured maybe a key swap hike. From the side of the bus they were from a local private school out for orientation. I may be wrong about all of this the people were very friendly, but we did not converse.) We stopped at Bromley Shelter and admired the view from an overlook and met Lynne at the parking lot. She had a good time in Chester Vermont and we started I wanted the kids to swim. We drove over to Grout Pond near the AT crossing of Stratton Arlington Road. When we arrived it started to rain, so in true hiker fashion we went swimming. The two fish boys enjoyed it and so did I. Swimming in a Vermont mountain pond in the rain was cool.Tyler later mentioned this was proably his favorite part of the trip.   Later we went back to the condo, cooked dinner and watched a movie.

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547685,"Really nice hike. Hot and humid because of the previous day's rain. Lynne dropped us off in the Route 140 parking lot. There was an old camper with garbage galore in and around it. The initial uphill with switchbacks was really not that difficult, but the humidity made us sweat profusely. We took a quick break at an overlook and moved at a good pace. It was stung by a small yellow jacket on the sam shin where the stitches are from last fall's hiking accident. I barely felt it and it did not slow me at all. It did start a weird day. We reached the top of the third and final Bear Mountain on the AT. We have hiked them all.    We moved quickly and Nick's pace was excellent. Any effects from his limp were no longer apparent and he flew even though it was wet and slippery. The Red Efts were out in full force. Later ahead of us Nick crouched down and had an accident in his pants. No big deal and not unprecedented. We moved off the trail and found a tree lowdown that Tyler Assured me would be the perfect shelter in place location in case of emergency. After the clean up we moved along at the previous fast pace. The smell of the garbage in my pack was occasionally overwhelming, but we trudged on. After passing people and quickly looking at the airport view for a second, we stopped at another view for a quick break. Then the fun began. Going down the steep decline toward the gorge I fell, three times on wet rocks. i was not hurt at least not physically. We had earlier passed a family of young kids and they were not action impaired. Anyway, I really can count on one hand the number of times that I have fallen. Tyler and Nick were fine and Tyler was shocked by me. With everything OK we stopped at the suspension bridge, took pictures and admired the gorge. It really is cool and a short walk from the parking. While waiting briefly for Lynne I love noticing the license plates in the easy to reach AT parking areas. They come from all over and as a matter of fact in Gorham I noticed 11 of the 14 states of the AT represented in the lot. I might have mentioned this before, but I have plates from all 50 states adorning my classroom,so I tend to notice them on cars. Lynne had a wonderful day near Rutland and we went to Qu's Whistle Stop. Awesome place. The food was great with a good price and extremely friendly people. Hiker who came in was treated so well as we were there. The owner spoke to us about special needs children and her granddaughter. Nick was making loud noises and she said that if anyone complained they would be kicked out. No one was there, but it was nice to hear. We noticed from a model they had there that the sign to High Point New Jersey was 350 miles away. We lie maybe 5 miles from there as the crow flies and been to the monument umpteen times. Alas, she informed me that this was her last season and they were stopping in late September. Oh well you just have to wish such nice people well and move on.

Lynne dropped us off at the Homer Stone Brook Trailhead and we hiked up the well marked trail on old tote roads etc. The trails in Vermont are well marked. It had a steep last section and it reminded me of hiking up to Sunfish Pond on a side trail in the Water Gap. When we got to the pond we went left and walk around a passed by the shelter and tenting platform. We found a beach area and swam. The bottom did not seem choice and Nick had not yet wanted to go in so we went further around. We found a great spot near the island and Tyler swam across. It was neat to be swimming at an elevation that was 50 feet higher than our home High Point. In our area you are really not supposed to swim, however we do swim in the Delaware and Raymondskill Creek quite often. Nick finally put on his bathing suit and swam across the channel with Tyler. I was right there and all of that swimming with a lifejacket and without on in pools really paid off. He did great. We stayed for over an hour and wanted to stay longer, but got no cell reception. We had to leave which was OK because quite a few day swimmers/hikers were coming gathering around the cliff and it was about to get crowded. We circled the pond again and headed on down to the parking. One of the books had said this was a popular spot. It sure was. Just like Sunfish Pond there were tons of people young and old, families etc. I love passing people on the trail and getting a whiff of perfume. It is better than hiker stench. We arrived at the full parking area and found Lynne up the road at another area when the road becomes dirt. She did not have a super successful day so she was a bit morose. We went back to the condo and finished our eclectic eat everything in the fridge meal and watched a movie. This vacation was awesome. Kim and John said we can come anytime and we are going to. The plan is to now come next summer with a bigger vehicle and start connecting the Vermont dots. In the meantime, we are planning a four day weekend trip in early November to Virginia. Maybe again at X-mas and then deeper south during Easter. Our immediate goal is a third of the trail in the middle and hike some in all 14 states. I think we can have that done soon. We will be hiking more locally every weekend with longer trips to Lynnes markets and the Catskills. The foliage is really beautiful up there.

Lynne had to work so the 3 of us took off and even though it is a drive we have fun and stop at sights, stores etc. The initial climb from the lot was cold. We had our cold weather gear and it was a far cry from the heat we encountered in August. After a half mile there was an overlook and we could see the car and the mountains in the distance. Hiking was no leaves on the trees is somewhat surreal. We passed a shelter that we visited on the way back and went up the usual ups and downs. We passed two SOBO thru hikers who were pleasant and we chatted for awhile. Later a NOBO hiked passed at a good clip and told us he was headed to Maine. We reached Cold River Road and turned around after taking a break by a nice brook. I mentioned the cold and wind and how it was not snowing, suddenly it started to sleet. Not for long and we made it back down with just enough light to spare. Unfortunately Qu's Whistle Stop is closed so we stopped in Hudson NY at our favorite Long John Silver's/ Taco Bell. This is after we got Nicholas a hamburger and fries at the McDonalds in Manchester Center. If you happened to read the Appalachian Train Conservancy Fall issue you read the Autism article of how Nick loves to hike and he just got in the car and went.

I, as always, will journal all new hikes on the AT. Happy Trails!!!

We finished and it had just a little bit of light. Tyler had the flashlights ready (he has all the survival gear in both of our packs.

We did short hikes for 3 days as Nick was not feeling well and had a loose tooth. Autism is a puzzle. He had not been eating much because his tooth bothered him, He also had a sinus infection that we were medicating. It really is amazing he hit the trails and swam in the pool with a smile and enthusiasm. Go figure! Anyway, Lynne dropped us offat the bottom of a dirt road after we turned near a weather station. We passed a Golden Retriever chomping on a deer leg with the spinal cord still intact. Later at drop off the dog walked by not paying attention at all. We knew tis was the ""roller coaster section"" and it was not quite as fun as an amusement park. This section reminds me of the NJ border to Bear Mountain. We had been hiking that area recently so our conditioning was fine. We saw a small waterfall and climbed to some nice views. Winter hiking is fun because you are rewarded with views and I could see this being a problem at other times of the year and it would create drudgery. Recently we encountered a coyote in the Delaware Water Gap. Today we saw no wildlife and very few people. That is until we reached Bears Den. The overlook was filled and there was a group of teenagers hanging out by the kiosk playing music. They were blocking the trail at the kiosk to the parking lot. They did move and were pleasant. The Den itself is nice and we sat and snacked at a picnic table. Lynne picked us up at the AT lot and we ate at Cracker Barrel. Lynne had a successful day picking and the boys swam for almost two hours. All this and Nick had a bad night of sleep. Go figure! We left the Blackburn Center connection for next time.

Even though it was in the teens weather wise and near zero windchill we have all of the gear to stay totally warm.

If you look at previous journals we usually hike at both ends and then the middle until we are finished. This helps with boredom etc., but really gives Lynne a chance to check out new places and either visit them again or cross them off her list. We entered the park at Swift Run Gap and the lady Ranger was a little flustered. There were quite a few bicyclists and I guess it can be chaotic. It was raining and I asked if it was going to rain all day. She responded, "" I hope so!"" well when we said we were not bikers she lightened up and gave us directions. The bikers were out and we passed many, many of them. We parked in the lot for Bootens Gap and started getting ready. It was cold and after the previous days 80 degrees I hadn' considered 51 and I thought I saw flakes. Having Nick makes you panic a little. We had all of our gear so that was no problem. I said maybe we should cancel and Tyler responded ""no this could be epic!"" Right up there with some of our favorite hikes the Mass/Vermont border or this winter's Prospect Rock. These two come to mind and are the kind where you wonder should you really be doing this and then when complete it becomes epic. Well listening to a 15 year old we set out and Lynne left us. Our Under Armour sweatshirts are good in light rain ,but it poured at times and they were decently soaked. Of course we had Frogg Toggs in our packs. Anyway it was fun, Bearfence area was fun and the Shenandoah mist was cool. I was a little cold at Lewis Mountain campground, but the rain stopped and we made good time and took our break at South Falls picnic area.

I wanted to bushwack to get a view, but felt it might be a waste.  When I reached Tyler he also heard it.

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570944,"Went to Vermont for the Fourth of July.  Really want to finish Vermont by the end of summer and with the August vacation we may just.  After driving up and the long ride up dirt stoney brook trail, I did not want to do too much to start especially with Killington the next day.  Th funny part about our hiking and it really is me, the planner, is that I jump around and hike both North and South depending on the topography.  This is partly because of boredom and mostly because I have to keep Lynne happy and give her different areas to pick.  Anyway,  StoneyBrook is a dirt road that gets progressively worse and creepier as you travel.  We passed many cabins and homes and finally had to stop and hike about 3/4 of a mile for fear that our little Jeep Patriot may not make it.  ( when we got to the trail crossing there was a Subaru Forester parked in the parking area braver souls that is for sure, my neighbor is a Subaru guy so a feather in his cap).  Once we got there we saw a great stealth site and a nice bridge.  We were going southbound today so up we went.  One thing we realized is that Vermont really has no easy trail and you have to adjust mileage.  Part of the problem was that the weekend before we hiked 13 miles out and back of the Houstatonic River in Connecticut, probably the easiest section on the AT.  (Harpers Ferry Canal and the boardwalk area here in Jersey are also easy)  We passed quite a few thru hikers and none seemed happy, forlorn would be the look.  The difference was apparent the next day on Killington.  We climbed the ladder in the picture and remembered the one that was on the NY border that was replaced with rebar.  Later we finally got to the top of Quimby Mountain and started our descent.  There were no views and the Vermud was everywhere due to recent rains.  This is where the hikers really looked forlorn.  I have read that this section, after the LT and AT split is a real pain and now I was seeing it.  As a matter of fact, we just finished the famous ""Roller Coaster"" in Virginia this spring and this section to Hanover may be worse.  When we arrived at the road, we walked a little on the boardwalk and went back down the road to meet Lynne.  There were cars everywhere as the falls was gushing because of the storm.  We went to eat at Denny's of Rutland.  They are always accommodating to special needs children and that is the most important thing to our type of family.  Then we went to the hotel and had the pool to ourselves for over 90 minutes.  Nick was in heaven.  He fell asleep and fireworks started right next to the hotel, so we vividly saw them and remarked that we had not seen any for many years since we had Nick.  It really was a great way to start our trip.  Oh yea, Tyler also told me of a girl he likes and wants to take out, yep hiking and communication are the best.","Stoney Brook Road

As we climbed I noticed nice well used trail and it started to get chillier.  Soon after Jungle Junction we put on our sweatshirts and this was perfect for the breeze and what was yet to come.  We hiked at a good pace and reached Cooper Lodge where I took a couple of pictures.  Nick had balked a little on the ups and now came the .2 extra to the summit.  It was steep and we were passed by a few people.  Nick really had no problem climbing, I just think that he cannot understand why you would ever want to go here when there is perfectly good trail down below.  The views were great and there were about 20 other people on top.  Most came up by Gondola and many were chilly in t-shirts as there was a chill.  The descent down was fun and we started down the mountain SOBO.  A hiker asked about the lodge and how he could not wait to get food.  I thought he meant Cooper Lodge and I tried to let him down easy.  Later, I looked up at the summit and saw the building and read about the food etc..  Oh well missed opportunity. We stopped at The Governor Clemente shelter and then forded the stream where our crocs came in handy.  I almost lost a croc in the raging stream.  My feet were really cold and Tyler took a dip.  I was surprised because I put my feet in either the Delaware River or Raymondskill Creek all summer and this northern stream was certainly colder.  After this we walked a short way on a dirt road and then down to a waiting Lynne on Upper Cold River Road.  We were 40 minutes late and she was starting to worry.  We had reception at the top, but no service down below.  We went to the hotel and swam for over 90 minutes by ourselves.  This is extremely awesome to people with a special needs child.  We went to sleep early and ALL slept through the night!","Route 4

The field was overgrown and we sprayed again before entering.  I took a few pictures and passed some cows then went over a stile and through a gate.  We were about to go to the stream when Lynne pulled in.  I gave the hikers water and told them of our hike and about Nick.  One of the hikers commented that he had worked  with children with Autism.  I told them that we live 5 miles from Highpoint State Park and they remembered the lake and concession stand.  Tyler and I bike and stop there at least 20 times a summer.  I also commented that it was reopened today after our great Governor closed all the parks for 2 days.  You know what I loved, these barely 20 something hikers could care less about politics, they just wanted to rest in a flowing stream and drink unfiltered water on another beautiful day.  Isn't that the way it should always be?   We drove Lynne to her antique place in Chester after she had already been to Quechechee Antique center.   We drove home and made it by 8:30 and got ready because summer school starts on the 5th.  On a side note, Vermont is as beautiful as it gets, driving around you are awed by its grandeur.  New Hampshire and Maine are like this too.  Now the problem is distance if you live in my area the Catskills are really comparable.  I know this is blasphemy, but go to where the Long path and other trails go and or Minnewaska State park and you will agree with me.  We will spend the rest of the summer Kayaking,Biking and Hiking until our Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine vacation at the end of August.","Lookout Farm Road

We always look, but never take. We do pack out garbage if there is any. There was a wire crossing the brook, but it was not needed as the water was low. This area is really a roller coaster and we moved at a good pace. It reminded of Pochuck mountain in our area. We hike there the previous week for Vermont Training. We met Stringbean, a speed record hiker and had hoped to see him in Vermont, but we didn't. I hope he makes it, because he was so upbeat and was rooting Nick on as we were going uphill. Anyway, we made it to the parking area on Route 12 and saw our first hiker of the day. We gave him water and met Lynne. She had had some success at Quechee Village not far away. We drove to our friends John and Kims condo in Manchester Center. I teach with Kim and we use their condo for base as we hike the state. With Vermont almost over letting us use their condo has been wonderful. Many thanks.

I have license plates from all states adorning my classroom at school so I always check them out. There were plates from all over Colorado an California really stick out. Lynne went to a flea market in Wilmington and then a couple places in Bennington. When she picked us up she was happy after a good day of picking. We got moving and climbing at a good pace through mud and over roots. We did not underestimate the climb so it wasn't horrible and we passed a few people coming down from the mountain. We got to the top and boy was it crowded. The weather was nice and there were people all over. We took a picture near the fire tower and went on. We have two towers near our house Culver and Catfish and Nick has balked at climbing them so we were not going to take a chance and make a scene. We did get views and pictures through the trees on both the way up and down. Later we did get great views of Manchester Center from Prospect Rock, so we really were content. Anyway, it was down and on at a good pace to Stratton Pond. We took the well known picture and moved down the shoreline where Nick and I sat in the sun while Tyler swam. This is always fun because in our area you are not supposed to swim in lakes/ponds. We do swim in the Delaware and Raymondskill creek all summer. But we would like to swim in Sunfish Pond and Hemlock Pond just to mention two. New England ponds offer a lot of fun. The trail after that was relatively flat and we moved quickly. Not thru-hiker fast,but still pretty quick. We got to Old Rootville Road and made our way to Prospect Rock. The views are really nice and this was the second time we were seeing them. We then went down to the parking lot where Lynne was waiting. We went to Manchester House of Pizza and ate. Very nice place and friendly/understanding to Special Needs. Went back to the condo and Nick fell asleep quickly, only to awaken at 2. That story is for our next journal entry. One small note Nick was stemming and I told a few people that he had Autism.

I did not feel good and actually vomited on the way up the steep hill. I felt much better after that, but I was hiking slower than usual. We passed the rock garden that reminded me of Sunfish Pond. We passed quite a few hikers and finally made it the pond. Of course the area that we swam in was being used so we found a little spot near the island in view of the little beach on the AT. Tyler swam, but saw a leech and that was it. We looked for the eclipse and kept looking. We never really saw anything, so we left and went down the Homer stone brook trail. On the way down we stopped in the stream and took a refreshing dip. This is something we do all summer in Raymondskill Creek in the Water Gap.

One guy was listening to his radio and singing the praises of life while slack packing. I got my boot caught under a root and fell right to the ground. Everything was ok, but it tore the tip of my boot. Those darn New England roots! After Lynne picked us up we took her to Chester to an antique mall an the on to Gorham. Rain was forecast for the night and it did look ominous for much of the day. We had just fixed up our old Ford Explorer and I informed Lynne that I wanted to go up Mount Washington. She had her worries, but agreed. Fifty dollars later we were on our way through fog like peanut butter or pea soup if you like. The transmission was humming and the road was difficult to follow. We probably should have hiked it, but that is for the future. At the top it was late so everything was closing. We walked around and took quite a few pictures. It was 60 degrees which is warm for the summit. Down below it was 90. The beginning of the drive down was treacherous, then it lightened up and the views were great. We got to the bottom, went to the Royalty Inn and the boys swam for quite awhile. We ate at Mr. Pizza and got Nick Burger King. Interesting that our two bases Manchester and Gorham have many businesses closed even in just the past year. Funny story was my rally cry for driving up.

She was ok when we returned an hour and half later. The hike was steady, but not difficult. The mud is what made it annoying. Vermud really made its name on this trail. We passed Journeys End camp and came to the marker and the northern terminus sign. A border patrol hellicopter went overhead as we were taking pictures. Verizon sent us a message about international minutes. We took tons of pictures and admired the view. After returning to the car, we drove the beautiful back roads of Vermont to Lake Champlain.

Not that Virginia was easy, but all the hikers we saw in this section never seemed to be happy. We passed a guy who we had encountered earlier in the week. He was a little older and moving slow. He said it was a bad day and he asked me what the large animal scat was. I replied Moose and he said he had been seeing it since Massachusetts. I said yep that is exactly where we first stared seeing it. I did not catch his name, but he was wearing something that said Puerto Rico and had an accent. He was a very nice guy.

I pull them down as much as he will let me and periodically check to see if his face is OK. The closer we got to the wayside the more people we saw. Many not really dressed for the weather. We cut through the campground and I went inside to get food as the boys waited outside. Inside was a madhouse. The restaurant was full and there was a line.

We were talking and I mentioned that we were in ATC magazine and she stopped. She said that she had shown many parents the article or the one from the online competition about us. She said many have no idea what to do with their children after the diagnosis and she uses us as an example of possibilities. She said we have inspired many. I am not really sure about that, but it is nice to hear. Meeting in the middle of the woods has at least shown that we practice what we preach. We met Lynne and took off shoes etc. in the parking lot. I mention this because after looking at pictures we figure that Nick lost his ankle bracelet here. Nick wears a tracking device provided by the Sussex County Sheriffs Department. (They understood and provided us a new one when we got home) We went to Rangeley and ate at Pine Tree Frosty while feeding ducks. We took a picture at the ""Halfway Between The Equator and North Pole"" sign and left for Gorham NH through very remote woods checked into the Royalty Inn, swam and called it a wonderful day.","Rout 17

There is a railroad bridge going over the river and route 2 that is easy to spot. We walked over the lower bridge after ducking and climbed up to the old dirt railroad trail. We encountered a few ATV riders as we hiked and made a right at an AMC sign to a trail that lead to Hogan Road. After we hiked on the dirt road we came to a well marked intersection with the Mahoosic Trail. We stayed on the road and encountered a few washouts that have made the road impassable. We had hiked here before, but the flooding must have been horrible. The boys hung out by the river that was now very low and we came to the junction with the Centennial Trail. We continued the walk past the power plant and the hostel to the trailhead. It was a nice simple hike and the weather was great. We went back to the hotel and swam for much of the afternoon.

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601847,"Beautiful day after a full day of rain. We have been doing relatively short hikes in preparation for Vermont and the finish of that state. We stayed in the Quechee Gorge area. This area is really nice and has quite a bit to do and see. There just isn't enough time. Anyway, Nick balked a little at first, of course in front of a young hiking group on a break, but the he was off. We moved very well and were at the south peak quickly. There were a few girls there with their dogs, so we took a crummy picture and moved on. Nick does not do well with dogs , which is surprising because he does well with the animals at his farm camp, Country Arc Farms, every summer. We encountered a few hikers and enjoyed the scenery. I took the picture on the North peak or where I thought it was. We backtracked to try and find a sign, but never found it. We hiked on some trail that I would compare to the Shenandoahs and Nick flew. The entire time Tyler and I spoke of our next big hike the 20 miler on Glastenbury Mountain. Lynne picked us up after a decent picking session and we went by the houses on Goose Pond. We ate and continued to our fiends condo in Manchester Center to prepare for the epic hike of this trip. Next year we will continue our journey from here.","Three mile road

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602064,"Finally, after almost exactly a full year we finished Vermont. I had wanted to come up last fall to finally finish, but the price for rooms because of the leaf-peepers was obscene. My friend Kim’s condo was booked so I figured finishing could wait the trail will still be there. During research I think I saw that this 20 miles over Glastenbury Mountain is the longest stretch on the AT with no road service at all. There are even dirt roads in Maine that are closer. We had hiked 16 miles once, a 15 miler and quite a few between 11-14. All of these had incorporated some sort of level dirt road/ rail trail etc. that sped things up. There was none of this where we were going. 
Add to this the fact that Nick had gone through quite the year. He fractured his foot in March and we pushed him in a wheel chair on the back roads of Sussex County NJ (Sunrise Mountain Road is always a favorite see pictures) The Jones fracture healed and we let him walk at times in that black boot brace that many are familiar with. The doctor said he had never seen one so beat up in his entire career. I don’t think he realized what kind of hiker Nick really is. After that his boots were too small but we did not know that they were hurting him. He would not wear them and would only wear crocs. We hiked many miles in crocs and he was not slowed at all, but I was worried about the winter months that always arrive quicker than you think. We had a tough time getting to try the bigger boots with many unpleasant standoffs on the trail. Eventually it worked and he was flying again. We hiked every weekend, as always, and did many double digit hikes. I wanted to do a big local training hike, but it got hot and humid. We hike/kayak on the Delaware River in the summer. This is where we lock up the kayaks and drive down to a boat launch. We then walk up the McDade Trail 3-5 miles and kayak back down river. We stop at campsites and swim. It’s fun and cooling. It really isn’t the best long distance training. To add to my trepidation was the fact that on our vacation Nick balked at putting on his boots once and was hopping around from a small cut on his foot. 
So here we are in Manchester Center ready to go on this epic hike. I wanted to get up early and get started so we did not have to contend with darkness at the end of the hike. I pushed it back a day to Saturday because Nick did not sleep well on Friday. We got up at 5 and hit the road for the 45 minute drive to US Forest Service Road 71 off of Keley Stand Road. By 6:45 we were on the trail. We moved really well even through the mud. Nick is amazing when he ended the hike he had a splatter or two of mud on his legs ad boots. I had caked on mud that looked like I was wearing boots twice their size. He analyzes the situation, steps on roots and rocks and keeps on going. We got to 5 miles quickly and took a short break at an unnamed highpoint. I was also able to text Lynne so this was good news. I had told her that 11-12 hours was about right. We always leave a time to meet in case of bad cell reception etc. The next 5 went well and we saw a few hikers. I figure that no beard is a Long Trail hiker and a beard a Thru hiker. We reached the fire tower and Tyler climbed to the top. I stayed with Nick at the bottom. It was weird we had seen a steady stream of hikers and during our 15 minute break no one and no noise. It was then that I remembered the Bennington Triangle. The Glastenbury Area has been a paranormal area with people disappearances, Bigfoot and UFOs sightings etc. I was a little creeped out, but soon realized it was probably the power of suggestion. 
We started off full of a renewed vim and vigor and went by the shelter that had a nice view and seemed to be very crowded for the middle of the day. We moved quickly for the next 3 miles and then hit a proverbial wall. It started to get hot and we started to go slow. Nick was actually the best and kept on truckin’. We were really slowed by the ups and downs and were really tired of the mud/roots and rocks. We took a break at Porcupine Overlook and realized we still had over 4 miles to go. We were able to update Lynne as to our progress or lack of and reached the stream and power cut eventually. Our descent down at the end seemed like it took forever. This was the only time Nick balked a bit. We arrived at Route 9 parking lot with a smiling Lynne handing us cold drinks and congratulating us for finishing Vermont. We peeled off the mud, grabbed some fast food and drove back to the condo. We took showers and were asleep quickly. I love accomplishing what we set out to do. 
This fall we will continue to hike every weekend. This will probably lead to doing New Jersey AT again as well as other trails both locally and in the Catskill etc. We will spend any vacation time adding to our mileage down south and back to New England next summer. Watch out Whites here we come!!!","

Nick flew and he stops and waits for us. He is now trained to move to the side when a hiker goes by.  Nick just loves being out there and some hikers will stop and talk.  We finished just as it got dark and brought food back to the hotel.  It was a good start for the next couple of days.","Jewel Hollow Overlook

Check it out it is really awesome, detailed and accurate it has really helped in so many ways. (rohland.homedns.org)  Anyway,  I thought I had read good dirt road well, this was not it. Basically it ended and became weedy.  I knew there was a brook nearby and I did not see one.  What had happened is that the GPS brought me to Andrew Road that must have led to the same area and been a complete road a long time ago.  The GPS just read a shorter route and sent us there.  We just turned at the road and did not even think of identifying the road.  We have permethrin clothes and sprayed twice before we walked through knee high weeds for about a mile and then we came upon the good dirt road and that it was.  We pulled off umpteen ticks and even more later when we got to the hotel.  After some map reading I figured out where the gate was mentioned on the site and we got to the crossing of the AT.  It was hot and humid.  Our demeanor was weak as we climbed to Eastman Ledges.  We took a break and the views helped us quite a bit.  All three of us felt kind of gross, but we trudged on.  We started to make good time at the log crossing near the intersection for the Hexcuba shelter, Tyler shouted that a log had broken.  Now down to one Nick I precariously crossed on one log.  I pulled it further to make it more obvious that it was broken.  A female hiker came along and she asked if the stream was the water source for the shelter.  I told her about the log and we left, climbing up Mount Cube.  It was tough, but we could handle it.  We made it to the signs and spoke with two gentlemen, one of which is the Southbound hiker we had passed yesterday.  I called Lynne and said we we running behind and all was good.  We started to desend and another female hiked asked if I knew what time the thunderstorms were starting.  I said about 3, but did not hear or see anything.  Sure enough 10 minutes later we heard the rumble of thunder.  Then it quickly started to rain cats and dogs and make a river out of the AT.  We went slowly with all the rocks and passed another woman.  She appeared to be a thru-hiker and then she passed us.  We were really late and there was no way to hurry up.  We met the girl at a side road and told her that 25A was a little further.  She inquired about a ride, but Nick will strip as soon as we get to the car and Lynne had the truck filled so I begrudgingly had to deny her. ( She did seem to find a ride or make other arrangements later.)  When we hit the parking area there was no Lynne.  We were an hour late from our revised late time and the only thing I could think of was that she was at the wrong 25.  There is route 25c/25A and 25 all in this area.   I tied to call, but had no reception.  Nick developed a Charlie Horse and I tried to calm him and that was not easy.  Tylers demeanor had diminished and every car that passed was not Lynne.  I decided to go the the summer camp across the street and use their landline.  I left Tyler with Nick and stared up the driveway of Camp Moosilauke.  I got halfway and realized I had no wallet.  I walked back and wouldn't you know it along came Lynne.  She was  annoyed and happy I am sure everyone knows the scene. She was here for over an hour and drove to 25c right before we arrived.    She then laughed at me calling from a landline because she still would have had no reception.  The one saving grace is that Nick has the ankle bracelet from the Sussex County NJ Sheriffs department and that could have been activated if things got worse.  We went to the hotel, swam and showered and still found a few more ticks on each of us.  We slept good that night and hiked a short two mile section the next day from Lyme Dorchester Road to Lyme Dorchester Road on our way home the next day.  I did learn a lesson about being more diligent about identifying roads etc.  We have since hiked parts of NJ this summer and have done quite a bit of hike/kayaking in the Delaware Water Gap this season.  The water temperature has been between 75-80 for awhile and mostly 80 during the recent heatwave.  More new miles will come in August and all of us can't wait!!!","Quinttown Road

I am looking forward to our longer August vacation.  I had read that markings were not great in this part of the state and that I found to be true.  I am used to seeing clearly marked white blazes at intersections etc..  This was unfortunately not always the case.  Sometimes the sign denoted the AT others not.  I have now learned that I ned to know the exact name of the trail that the AT traverses.  Not really a big deal just an adjustment that needs to be remembered, because Nicholas is not always the most patient when he is in the hiking ""zone"".  We are still hiking closer to home and getting ready for vacation.  Did NJ again over last few months and am now doing parts of NY.  For those hikers who are not there yet.  The trail from just before the NY/NJ border to Elk's Pen in Harriman is also known as little Maine.  The guidebooks show relatively flattish terrain, but believe me the PUD's make it annoying and wet weather makes the long rock walks extremely slick.  We got caught in a t-storm the other day and it was not easy.  Please enjoy your hiking it really is a great activity.","

As a matter of fact, we had tried to finish this in July, but ran into a huge road closure that limited our options of reaching the trailhead that did not take hours.  Quintown Road leads on a good dirt road to the trail crossing between Smarts and Cube mountains.  Last summer we had an epic hike up Cube that included us walking through the remnants of a road that parallels Quintown Road. It was and is covered in high grass and we had ticks galore.  When we saw it this year Lynne couldn't believe we walked through it.  She remembers pulling multiple ticks off of us last year even though our clothes were permethrin treated, we sprayed multiple times, got drenched in a thunderstorm and swam in a chlorine pool.  Ticks are a pain in the rear.  Anyway, after our drop off we walked past the open gate, over a bridge and up to reach the J trail.  Knowing the name of the trail that you are hiking in NH can be helpful.  A logging truck came flying past us as we started to ascend.  The hike up Smarts Mountain southbound was pleasant.  We past a few Thru-hikers and arrived at the firetower and cabin.  Tyler and I took turns climbing the tower and enjoying the great views on a spectacular day.  The descent was steep and there were many steps and rebar.  We were extremely glad that the trail was dry.  We reached the cliffs and took a break admiring the view and realizing we could just make out the tower behind us.  We spoke with a friendly hiker, Due North, and he filled us in on his hike.  It is always fun to tell hikers that we are from NJ and can see the High Point Monument from our house.  Pretty much any hiker that has been through NJ knows the monument.  We saw a few more hikers and met Lynne only a little after our agreed upon time.  We left and ate at the White Cottage Snack Bar in Vermont and the boys played in the river.  It was a great hike and a great day on the Appalachian Trail!!!","Quintown

We met many Thru-hikers and made our way to the super misty top.  The wind was whipping, but it wasn't that cold. (we had sweatshirts/coats/gloves/hats etc.)  We took a picture for a LASHER and he disappered into the mist.  It was whiteout type conditions.  Then, as we always do in NH, we got a little lost.  The trails always change names and Tyler and I weren't sure.  The large cairns weren't readily seen.  When we quickly rectified the situation we made good easy time to the Glencliff Trail and then it became slow go again.  It is steep and the roots and rocks slippery.  It remided me of the hike up to Killington's view, but much longer.  Anyway, we made it to the pickup point where Lynne had cold drinks and a smile.( She had a productive day and trip picking) We went up to Gorham after that and did some more hiking that I will journal soon.  Mt.

We originally had wanted to go to the BRP and hike along that, but because of the storm it was gated.  The boys and I alternated plans and park at the bridge lot.  It was solid climbing with good views.  The only people we saw was a hiking group taking a break at Matt' Creek Shelter and two guys staying the night at the shelter on the way back.  We turned around at Hickory Stand Trail and will connect there in the future.  We went back to the hotel swam and ate pizza again. (can never eat too much pizza :) Another great day!","James River Footbridge

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660269,"The mild winter has allowed us to pretty much do NJ again and some other trails. We did our sled hiking in December and haven't since.  Although, they are calling for some snow next week before the season is over.  Today we got about an inch of snow here in northwest NJ and are about to head out to either High Point or Sunrise Mountain.  I remembered I had to write up this hike from our December trip.  The weather was wonderful and we hiked up and over cove mountain to the shelter for a quick out and back before we headed home.  We saw one other hiker from the shelter, but did not converse.  Nick was awesome, he tenses up like a little kid going swimming, when I tell him its time to put on his hiking clothes.  His singing and sounds he makes( we call it his Gregorian chant) are so indicative of contentment.  I wish we all could have the level of contentment he exhibits on the trail, it is extremely liberating for all.  Anyway, we finished went to Sheetz and drove home.  It was a long trip, but we saw 41 states license plates along the way.  We, of course, will still hike every weekend and more. We are  on target to get down south during Spring Break to keep matriculating along the trail in quest of our ultimate goal.","Bearwallow Gap

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662169,"The spring break finally came.  We had already hiked every weekend in 2023, but we were chomping at the bit to get in some new AT miles and connect some dots in Virginia.  Lynne was unable to come on this trip, so it was going to be all out and backs.  We started at Petites gap and hiked southbound to where we left off in December.  It was perfect weather, about 61degrees, sunny with a Nice breeze.  There were climbs mixed in with some very flat, almost rail trail type sections.  The boys really move at all times.  Nick makes noises on climbs, but keeps moving, almost like complaining.  I let them pass me on climbs and take my time, eventually I get there.  When we got to our turnaround point we reminisced about December 29th, the last time we were here.  There had been an ice storm before that date and the ice was still prevalent.  As a matter of fact the trail was covered and would have been treacherous(much of the BRPW was even closed then), so we had turned around at this point.  Well, that was not the case on April 11th, it was perfect.  We noted everyday how spring was a couple of weeks ahead of NJ and how the green tufts of grass really mark the trail, just follow the green this time of year!  We finished went to Pizza Hut and ate it at a  picnic table next to the James River.  Then we went to the hotel, swam in the warm indoor pool and slept great.  A great start to a fun trip!","Petites Gap

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662585,"Just finished(4/22) an annual Pennsylvania hike from Route 191 Fox Gap to the DWG bridge. Lynne shops at the Saylorsburg Flea Market and we go to local Red Robin after.  It was awesome and the Rocksylvania little pointy rocks were ""rockin"".  I bring this up because Tyler and I have found Virginia to be no joke. There are rocks, roots and climbs. We can see how hikers get the ""Virginia Blues"". The beautiful views are wonderful, but redundant.  Nick won't even follow us down a short side trail because it will be somewhat uneventful. It always seems to be hugging the side of a ridge or cone.  We do like the area and are enjoying our matriculation.  The day was perfect and 78 degrees with extremely low humidity.  We passed many hikers, some thru hikers and some section hikers from near our home.  We finished and ate Papa Johns Pizza by the river at a picnic table and swam at the hotel.  A wonderful day!!!  ( Oh a reenactment of the boys from over 10 years ago is today's picture)","Petites gap

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662777,"This was a good hike.  Our week of perfect weather came to an end somewhat.  The temperature was in the 80's and the low humidity was over.  We had seen the Guillotine in pictures many times.  We were a tad underwhelmed, but I have to say that The Lemon Squeezer in NY is a little underwhelming and we have been there many times.  We actually enjoyed the strange orb on top of Apple Orchard Mountain more.  We only have about 20 miles left and will have connected the two 4,000 foot mountains Apple Orchard to Mount Moosilauke. We were going southbound at first and then descended.  We passed many people saying we were going in the right direction, then we said we had to come back and they weakly smiled.  We got to Cornelius Creek Shelter and turned around.  It was getting humid and somewhat unpleasant.  We decided to use a dirt road that paralleled the trail somewhat, after Parkers Gap Road.  It was hot and in the open sun, but something different.  For hiking demeanor that is sometimes most important.  For the record, we have made sure we hiked every blaze from Virginia to NH, but once we've done it we will Blue Blaze as much as possible. We got back to the car went to Sheetz, swam and had a great nights sleep.  It wasn't perfect, but it always ends well.","Upper Blue Ridge Parkway

We hit the connection at the shelter from December and turned around.  We went by a few thru hikers on the way and spoke to two back at the parking lot.  We love hearing their stories and wish we had more time to speak.  We left straight from there, went to Chick-fil-A ,Cabellas and Sportsman Warehouse on the way home.  We will continue to hike and kayak every weekend in the spring and then go north in June to continue in that direction in both NH and Maine.  We may even redo a few sections in Vermont that we liked.

Flippertree for Autism,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666378,"Went on a short trip to New England after school let out.  Had plans to do a couple of new hikes, but alas, many various reasons cut the plans and trip shorter.  It rained and rained both in Manchester Center  on our way up and when we got back.  We stayed in North Conway and hiked up from route 302.  It was slippery and sloppy, but no rain, just damp.  After we finished we went to the Highland Center and had lunch.  We had to leave the next day and went back to Manchester and hiked there.  Kim's Condo is like a home away from home and we really enjoy the hospitality.  Funny thing about Vermud, it was very wet, but unless you stepped in the boot sucking mud it wasn't the nasty mud, just wet.  We then returned home and hike two of our favorite AT sections here, so it wasn't a total loss.  As of now we have big hiking plans in August down south, but with our life we shall see. Life is really the rollercoaster and not the one in Virginia.","Crawford Notch Route 302
