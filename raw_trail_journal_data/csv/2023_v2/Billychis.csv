Billychis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661718,"On a flight from NY back to CA and getting inspired by looking through the entries of others like Purple Haze who are already out on the trail!  Have now purchased the majority of my gear and tested a bunch of it - I am a relative novice backpacker, having really only done a couple extended overnights (Grand Canyon Rim to Rim to Rim and Mt Lassen trip, both of which were guided), so getting ready is a bit daunting.  Still waiting on my tent which could prove to be a challenge.... Did prepare a delicious freeze dried Pad Thai meal with my new Pocket Rocket stove which my wife and son declared ""good enough for off trail eating!"".

Billychis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661837,"Got out to Monte Bello park down in Palo Alto to put in some steps with some good hills with my pack this morning as the sun was rising and the birds were chirping! Did about 12 miles pretty quickly and was pretty tired after - both affirming but also daunting - i am sure I could have easily cranked out another 5-7 (which would have gotten me to my targeted daily average), but also was pretty tired and not sure how I will feel tomorrow!
Been thinking about what my trail name might be - I really don't want to let too much to chance lest I end up as Bear Bag or Fritos or something like that (no offense to anyone with those names!!!!). I am hoping for something inspiring like Sporto or The Kid...

I walked with my pack again, and other than some hip and butt soreness it went ok.  I have a game of pickle this afternoon which might be my waterloo at this point, but so far so good.  
Started reading A Walk in the Woods (Bill Bryson's account on the AT) and I am pretty sure that at least i will be a bit more prepared than Katz!  hahahahahhahaha... Need to get to REI today or tomorrow for some missing pieces (including ""piece"" of mind), but otherwise all good!  
In addition to thinking through potential trail names, i am also dedicating a few cycles to jokes for the trail - ideally some meta-type stuff that summit all up nicely

Only 9 days until hitting the AT and this 13 miler up and down skyline with my full pack was a good confidence builder. It was a challenge, but then again completed it in under 5 hours, so take that!
I have decided that I am going to do a couple novel things on the AT to keep my mind occupied and not get too bogged down in the basement of my brain - first, do some French learning. And second, keep track of all of the flowers I see out there. Who knows, maybe I will run into a few botanist  Frenchies on the trail to further my studies at the intersection of things.

Been getting questions about why doing this and also why the AT. The first one is kind of layered - def a part of me that wants to put myself in a different ""place"" and see what happens.

Got in about 18 miles today so basically on track, although my legs are barkin'! 
Highlights included rhodos the size of trees (Burt's dad would be so boned up), some trail magic when a shuttle driver at a crossroads gave me a lolli, setting up my tent (nailed it), eating Murray's cheese. 
And for those following at home I made it 3.01 miles before having to use the poop trowel.  
I am in a real pickle wrt tomorrow though - either I do a paltry 10 miles and stop before heavy bear country (where I need a bear tin to stay over night that I don't have) or I blast through and do 21 miles including the leg churning blood mountain.... hmmmm.

I was pretty sore yesterday and the grandpa calf was teetering and wasn't sure how things would go today - but my body seems to have really adjusted to the ups and downs and mileage pretty well (famous last words I suppose!). Am I getting my trail legs day 3?
It seems like my ""religious"" moments mostly happen in the morning when I am still really fresh and today was no exception. Was in the middle of a copse (look it up Gigi) of trees and Shrike came on my Spotify - so perfect. 
Also found myself laughing ou loud to myself about how amazingly silly yet perfect my trail name is - skittles! Basically can be anybody out here and to hear people call me that and to intro myself with the name is so funny. 
Oh and I saw a freakin bobcat on the trail today - about 50 yards ahead, just cruising along...
looking forward to a potentially big day tomorrow - another 19 miler if my body is still willing!

Billychis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663273,"A big day on the trail today. Phone basically dead so not much music, and a lot of time thinkin' over 19+ miles. 
first, thought about the puds concept (pointless ups and downs) and get it as I am climbing or descending but in the end that is the Point - the ups and the downs...
second, had a really cool experience going up Kelly Knob (which btw at mile 16 definitely wasn't a knob). Tried something different where I put my head down (literally), pulled my hat down and never looked up. Then I concentrated on my breathing, and sped up or slowed down only based on my breathing. I stayed right at the top of my aerobic zone and felt really good, almost spiritual (weird?). Wouldn't have had that experience on the flats btw. 
third - seems like there are four groups on the trail - (I) the mid to late 20 somethings who have just quit their first job and are trying to sort out their next steps / life (ii) the over 60 retirees finally able to take the walk of their lives (iii) the mid 30s recently left the military and (iv) me. 
Many other thoughts too but will leave you with this - top 3 irreplaceable items (aside from the obvious) 
- poles - unless you have the knees and hips of a 20 year old these are a must
- stove - a hot meal at dinner or coffee in the morning are so special
- camp sandals - let the dogs breathe

Billychis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663394,"I will probably end up being that guy (and embrace it) that says - ""well... on the trail..."" to most anything. Like when Aidan complains about me parking the car too far away from the store : ""well on the trail I would walk that distance with a 40 pound pack 2000 times a day, uphill"""" or when quentin says he is tired : ""well on the trail we would walk up Albert mountain hand over hand with a 40 pound pack after 20 miles already done - that's tired"".... get ready people 
Today was a good day after a great night sleep at the holiday inn express (stayed off trail in hiawasse ga last night to get electronics recharged, watch Celtics etc) and a large dominos pepperoni pizza (the thing I have been craving more than anything (and I mean anything...), cinnamon twists, 2 pop tarts and 3/4 of a party size bag of bugles. Only did 16 miles because didn't hit the trail until 10, and even then still had to hike until 745 to get to a campsite (and really tested my setup capabilities including food bag hanging as the sun was setting).   
Another observation - Turns out pretty much everyone on the trail does the wacky tabacky (except me - little k own fact but I was k own as ""wholesome bill"" in high school) around campfire etc. 
Last thought - I have done some of best thinking in recent memory on this trip - not claiming that I have had any truly original thoughts perse, but at least have really examined some concepts that I normally don't have the time or the focus for. Having the time is an obvious driver, but there is something about walking that helps me focus and think bigger and better - having something in the background like hiking really helps (kind of like doodling helps too). Anyway, chew on that one if you can focus for a minute

Billychis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663397,"Went nuts today - 24.2 miles including a grueling climb up Albert Mountain (see photo). Felt so good until miles 21 when I started flexing a bit on some macho 20 something's and crushed them up a tough uphill - then felt my Hammy Davis jr... serves me right - so unAT of me. 
A couple things to mention. First - bears! I hung my bag last night for the first time by myself and because I was rushed (didn't get to camp until late) , chose a pretty sketchy tree and fretted all night about it. I was up from 2-4 listening for any sound (not sure what I expected to do about it).  Turns out i just got lucky. Unfortunately, my hiking friend Bugs (a few of us want her to switch her name to Cat since she likes cats) didn't. The bear knocked her tree over (it was also apparently sketchy) and then went nuts. Only left her ""gummies"" and her coffee. We all rallied and gave her a bunch of stuff (that is what we on the trail do) but still pretty big bummer (but an exciting story). 
Also was cataloging all of the cliches you hear on the trail - ""hike your own hike"", ""great day for it"", ""it's a marathon"", ""how far you going?"", ""you a thru hiker or a lasher?"" (long ass sectional hiker - which is what I am btw), (on a downhill) ""I'm not sure which is worse.."" the list goes on. 
Also need to talk to dr. Huberman . There is some really nutty physiological stuff going on with me on this hike. I think I am having ""runners highs"" multiple times a day (gulp) - if I keep my heart rate in a medium to high aerobic zone (not going anaerobic though) on an uphill, when I get to the top, straighten up and my heart rate quickly drops (which is happening lickety split now) I get a crazy euphoria feeling - I have had a runners high before but it is always elusive and unpredictable until now - so who needs to ganja afterall! 
Last thought related - talking with Kimberly last night crystallized something for me - the whole mind body connection that comes out of hiking long distances like this - and it is probably a lot like why people like yoga. I find myself multiple times a day checking in with my body (even vocally) and doing a full scan - out loud ""ooh the plantar fasciitis is something I need to keep an eye on today"" or ""how are you doing today mr shoulder, you seemed a bit out of sorts yesterday"". Wonder who is listening 
And today I crossed over 100 miles! By Tuesday or Wednesday should be crossing into the Smokies! Queueing up the Ronnie Milsap already...

Billychis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663466,"My friend Bert is apparently obsessed with my journal (so nice!) and pointed something out to me re the locations on the AT that I have been referencing
- Lick Log, Ramrod mountain, Woody Gap, Young Lick, Kelly's Nob, Dicks Creek, Showbird Gap, Rocky Nob, Swinging Lick (although the sign as seen in attached seems to look like ""Dick"") Gap, and Chunky Girl (seriously). 
And these are only the ones I have passed so far...
As I wrote in a text to a friend who was criticizing (playfully of course) me for texting from the trail today, today I lolligagged a bit, which was nice! I only did 16 but given 25 yesterday and a big day tomorrow it seemed fine. Hike your own hike skittles! 
Now that I have been on the trail for almost a week I am starting to feel like I can dish out some advice to the novice hiker out there - and so my first piece of advice is: when you have a choice, avoid camping at a gap when there is road access and parking and instead go that extra bit up the hill to the campsite up there - if someone wants to shiv you, make 'em break a sweat. And on that note... Shiv : hot or not hot? 
and I will leave you with the insightful words of the rapper Latto from her new hit single ""Lottery"": ""you gotta work for this, you can't purchase this"" - that about sums up life on the AT

Billychis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663530,"Big day on the trail today -  26 miles including 4k of elevation gain in last handful  of miles. Also much warmer today so feel like I drank a lake. At the NOC actually picked up a Monster energy drink - haven't had one of those in forever!  Also could no longer avoid the rain and got pretty wet as I headed out of camp.  But I don't melt!
Definitely feel like I have my trail legs now - doesn't really matter how much / how long the uphills are. Kind of crazy. Bring it.

Billychis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663573,"After a long 26 yesterday I toned it down a bit and did only 16 and arrived in one piece at Fontana Dam - in part also because it was either that or head into the Smokies for another 5 miles (which would have put the hurt on me). Want to get into the Smokies fresh (ie tomorrow)!
Cravings are front of mind of the trail. A perfect example happened yesterday. I have been craving a foot long in me for about the last 50 miles. So i called a guy named Jason from the trail, and he picked me up at Stecoah Gap and drove me to Robbinsville NC. We chatted in the car and then he dropped me off at Subway where I got a foot long teriyaki chicken - so good. 
On the food front I have been having a trip down memory lane here on the trail. Food that I thought I would literally never want to, or be able to, eat again (due to heartburn, weight mgmt., general common sense) has been on tap 24/7. To list a few of the delicacies I have eaten with gusto and in volume: pop tarts (brown sugar cinnamon are by far the best), ramen, krackel bars, slim Jim's, corn nuts, dill pickle lays potato chips, pepperoni slices, bazooka gum, pizza (stuffed crust no less) and of course skittles! It all gets burned so quickly that it doesn't have time to reel havoc on the stomach and bowels - what a treat! And it tastes so so good now! 
Also I had my first ""low"" moment today - my dogs were really barkin, I was low on battery for music and had a long day still ahead - but then about 2 minutes later I came to a big hill - crushed it, got my endorphin rush and was great again! 
Looking forward to a hot girl walk tomorrow as I head into the Smokies!!!

Billychis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663630,"It was bound to happen, but for a variety of reasons, today was a real grinder (and I don't mean the foot long variety). I really struggled today and just really wasn't ever in the flow like I have been pretty much every other day.  Oh well. In terms of why, a bunch of reasons. First, the guy last night that rolled in around 1130pm and set up right next to me definitely compromised my sleep - I gave him a few choice words I must admit (no swears though). Second, there was a serious amount of vertical ups today - I started at Fontana at about 1500 feet, but had to get up to 5000+, and then had a number (4-5) 1k+ ups and downs from there. Third, i covered a lot of distance - I started at 745am and rolled into camp at 815pm and did 24 or so miles - the reason I did is because I will be out of food tomorrow so I need to get to a resupply point (gatlinburg) by end of day - that is just bad planning by me (should have gotten more than the pepperoni slices and pop tarts at the Fontana marina - I. And lastly and on a related note, the food I ate today wasn't right. I am pretty in tune with my body right now and I just didn't have enough long acting carbs - so when I needed to dig deep for the uphills my legs felt so heavy and weak.

Billychis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663661,"A nice bounce back day for skittles! I went out with a really positive attitude today and a mindset of hike your own hike, and it worked. You really can't rush your hike out here or have expectations. One step at a time - left right left right. Even the smoky mountain afternoon rain couldn't dim my spirits today. I'm headed into gatlinburg today (apparently a must see) and treating myself to a night at the holiday inn express! And maybe another stuffed crust pizza ?
Regarding my dome - I actually was referring to something that happened yesterday (I didn't report lest I worry the worriers out there) but really got a smack down from an overhanging tree that caught the top of my done and literally knocked me off my feet onto my back - I lay there for a 2-3 minutes, initially in shock and then to take stock of my possible injuries - and I ended up fine miraculously - but the reason I mention it is that even though I was having a really tough day, my first thought when it happened was ""oh no, if I am concussed I can't go on!"" - a good sign and confirming my love for it out here, regardless of what hits me.

Billychis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663701,"Hi everyone! I am taking what we on the trail call a ""zero day"" today. Farting around at the holiday inn, checking out the dystopian town of gatlinburg (it is the sweet spot for Ripleys Believe it or Not - I feel like there must be a Margaritaville around here somewhere), doing laundry, eating pancakes... it is so strange that there would be a boardwalk-like town as the gateway to the Smokies.
Anyway, about that photo. Turns out the Skittles are now outlawed in a bunch of countries and a handful of states are considering as well. So basically I am now an outlaw! Bad boy, bad boy, whatcha you gonna do, whatcha gonna do when they come for you...
Yesterday as i descended from the viewing tower at Clingmans Dome (there is a touristy viewing spot there that you can basically drive to) a woman came up to me and told me she was going to do a section of the AT in June.  She asked me how the rest of the trail compared to the paved half-mile walk from the parking lot the the tower...

Billychis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663814,"Great to be back on the trail today after lolligaging in gatlinburg yesterday. Knocked off 16 miles, which is kind of light but it was really the only option - the next shelter was closed due to a bear attack and the next after that 14 miles more which would have put me at 30 after a somewhat late start.
on the topic of the bear attack, apparently purple haze got nipped in the buttocks on her return from the privy at Cosby Knob Shelter. She had to come off of the trail, so when she comes back she will be a bit behind - that kind of bites...
Apparently there are 2 bears per sq mile in the Smokies - I took at poll at tri corner and pretty much everyone has already seen a bear - except me, unless you count Build a Bear - he is Belgian! 
One more thought on the Smokies - I wasn't really getting all of the hubbub until today. There has been alot of fog so the views haven't been evident - but then this morning as I came around the corner and saw the view in the picture attached I got it - it reminds me of a painting from the Hudson River School (look it up Gigi). The combo of the fog and the shaft of sunlight ejaculating through a gap is stunning. Tomorrow I exit the Smokies - that will be something to spout off about for sure!

Billychis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663820,"Another slightly awkward distance day today - came into the hostel around 3pm having completed about 18 mostly downhill miles and was on the fence about continuing on - the next shelter was 8+ miles - but then good old Mother Nature intervened and decided for me as an old fashion downpour hit, and I decided to stay put. I am staying in a bunk room today - for someone of my advanced age and proclivity for high count pima cotton sheets this should be quite novel - I am sort of excited / nervous / sketched out all at the same time. I sure hope the bed bugs don't bite! 
but I digress a bit from the title of this post!  the drama unfolded as follows... I woke this morning pretty early and headed over to get water and get my ursack food bag down from the bear cable system. As I was getting water I noted P (full name withheld!) was headed out. I then went over to get my food sack and something was amiss. First of all, it was on the wrong cable, and second, it looked very empty. I took it down and lo and behold it wasn't mine. After polling the remaining group it became clear that it was probably P that took it. So I hustled and got all my stuff packed up and headed down the trail after him. I knew I had a shot at catching him - I had noted as he left that he was wearing long underwear under his shorts. He had at least a 20 minute head start - and as I jogged ahead I realized I didn't know if he was heading north (like me) or south! Oh sugar! Since I was meant to be going north and at worst I had his bag (but it was a very lopsided trade - in mine I had a bunch of ""gourmet"" prepared meals, food snacks after a restock in gatlinburg and all of my meds ) while in his all there was was 2 tuna sensations packets and a snickers bar.  well, I thankfully caught him about an hour later and sure enough, he had my bag!

Billychis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663882,"Got a decent mileage day in today for my penultimate hike - did 21 miles. The hike was kind of wacky though (a tale of two cities if you will) - the first half was a very challenging uphill grind where I sweat like the dickens - over 3000 feet of gain in 5-6 miles (and then a series of uphills for another 5-6 miles), while the second half of the day was flat and winding alongside a series of creeks through a deep forest - a lovely walk in the woods... i certainly prefer them in that order fwiw
I am sure you are all on the edges of your seats with respect to my experience at the hostel - the waking experience was great, while sleeping not so much. There was a resupply ""closet"" that had good snacks and soft drinks (I got a grape soda) and beer and Hard seltzers (i abstained), and then they made a group meal which was delish. There was also a campfire and music too (bluegrass)! So that part was great. The sleeping in the bunk room was a problem. I simply can't sleep when others are snoring, even if I am wearing earplugs. I basically knew I was in trouble when I saw B (name disguised!) - he had a thick neck and overall girthy proportions, and I knew this meant snoring (sorry to prejudge). What I didn't realize is that it also meant farting. Apparently it is ok to indiscriminately rip loud farts in a bunk room? Anyway, by 445 I was done trying to sleep and basically was up for the day and headed out onto the trail by 630. When I introduced myself to someone today as Skittles, he said ""hey I heard about you""!!!!!
One last thought... when I got to Max Patch Summit and looked back at the Smokies (see photo attached), i must admit I got a little of that smoky mountain mist in my eyes. It has been an incredible two weeks, and while I am ready to go home, as Ronnie Milsap, he of ""Smoky Mountain Rain"" fame, would say, ""I wouldn't have missed it for the world...""
