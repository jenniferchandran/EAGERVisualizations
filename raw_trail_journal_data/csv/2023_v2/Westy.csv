Westy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659812,"My name is Rob Potvin and I’ll be hiking the Appalachian Trail starting in early February. I completed a thru hike of the AT in 2016 and made thwarted attempts in 2019 and 2022. The 2019 attempt was ended by injury after 109 miles and the 2022 ended by illness after only 32 miles. On all three hikes I used the trail name Westy and I will use it this time as well.
In 2016 I wrote a daily journal which is still on Trail Journals. I did summary journals weekly in 2019 which has been deleted and an introductory and final journal in 2022 which is also still on Trail Journals. Both of these journals contain information about my trail prep, gear and resupply strategies which are pretty much the same as this attempt so I will not rehash them here.
When I completed my thru hike in 2016 I was 68 years old and felt my age many days. That I managed to complete it was due in equal parts to not really knowing what I’d gotten myself into until well into the hike, incredible support from my wife Kathy and good old fashioned doggedness on my part. This time I’ll be 75 and I do fully understand how truly difficult it will be so I’ll need equally incredible support from Kathy and even more doggedness on my part.
I’m asked a lot why I am hiking the trail again and, like my two previous hikes, have no real sensible answer. If pressed I have given three somewhat sensible answers. The first is that want to more fully experience the social aspect of a through hike. In 2016 though most of the hike I was not sure how my body would hold up so in many instances I passed up socializing with other hikers around the evening campfire or the trail town pub in order to relax and rest up. Also all the time I spent in towns working on my detailed daily journal limited the time I had to socialize. This time I plan to enjoy the company of other hikers more.
The second somewhat sensible reason for hiking the trail again is a desire to complete it “end to end”. When I did my 2016 hike I did a “flip flop”. I hiked north from Springer to Duncannon, Kathy then drove me to Katahdin where I hiked south to Duncannon. I know this was a perfectly legitimate thru hike; I passed by each and every white blaze but somehow finishing up at the Doyle Hotel wasn’t the same emotional rush I want to experience at the summit of Katahdin. I’ll admit that’s a pretty lame excuse for hiking another 2,200 miles but it’s one of three reasons I can come up with.
The third reason is simply that I really, really want to do it again. I missed the trail and wanted to do it again soon after I completed it in 2016 and that desire still burns within me. I realize this is a younger person’s endeavor but I’ve just got to give it one more try. 
I won’t be doing a daily journal but will do summary progress reports when I an have internet connection. I’ll try to make them interesting and informative and, while my target audience is family and friends, everyone is welcome to join me in my journey along the Appalachian Trail.

Westy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659879,"The Trail Journals website doesn’t publish/display journal entries until there are three entries so this and the next are to meet that requirement. 
My first real entry will be from the trail, probably from Hiawassee, Georgia around February 15th.

Westy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660087,"Hello all,
I have reluctantly decided to end my through hike attempt.
Day two was a real test and it didn’t go as well as I expected. It was only 7.6 miles long and only climbed 900 feet. During my previous through hike this section of the trail was hard but this time felt much, much harder. I was more winded than in previous attempts and needed to take more frequent and longer breaks.
Although I was able to complete this section by early afternoon I was tired enough that I wasn’t looking forward to going again the next day. I thought I was well prepared but I guess my old bones and muscles simply aren’t what they used to be.
When I reached the trailhead I sat and talked to Kathy and reflected on my situation. I decided that if I continued I would almost certainly make it out of Georgia (78 miles), probably be able to hike to Franklin (109 miles) and maybe, just maybe, struggle to get to Fontana Dam and the start of the Great Smoky Mountains (166 miles). But, being truthful, I seriously doubt I’d make it through the Smokies and beyond.
I decided that my ultimate goal to complete my though hike was, at my age, simply out of my reach and that it made little sense to keep trying with no hope of completing it. 
While hiking I chatted with a couple of through hikers and both were really excited about hiking the trail and, despite the cold weather and difficult terrain, having a great time. I felt none of that. I realized I wasn’t having any fun but was plugging along just to get to the next trail head. The Appalachian Trail is terribly difficult at best but darn right impossible when your heart isn’t in it. 
So, I have decided another through hike isn’t in the cards for me. I’ve completed it once and will forever cherish that experience. I have no regrets at all.
I hope all of you that may have planned to follow me on my journey will search around this site to find others to follow. Everyone journaling has a tale to tell and some may keep your interest for many more months.
Thank you all for your well wishes and support. I cherish that as well.
