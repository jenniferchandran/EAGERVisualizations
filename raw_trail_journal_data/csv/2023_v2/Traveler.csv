Traveler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660229,I had planed an 8mi. walk today. When I looked outside I saw that winter storm Olive had arrived. With -4 wind chill and 25mph. wind. I decided to stay inside  drink some hot chocolate and eat cookies. Maybe I can find a good backpacking movie.,,View Entry,"Feb 23, Thu",0

Traveler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662023,A very warm day in Michigan. Left my home at 6am so I could catch the sunrise over Lake Huron. It was a prefect day for short's and tee shirt. (First time this year). Walked for 2 1/2 hours. I have packed and unpacked my pack taking things out and adding things. I guess everyone goes through this no matter how many you go on the trail.,,View Entry,"Apr 13, Thu",0
Traveler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663660,This will be my last pre hike post.The next post will be from the trail. Maine has very limited cell service so there may be some long gaps between posts. I will do my best to post every day. I do not know how far i will get but it matters not.I will cherish everyday I get to spend in the beautiful outdoors and all of the wonderful people I will meet. To borrow a line Mary Oliver  maybe our real job is to look and listen and maybe the world without us is the real poem.To my family and friend's that have wished me well may the peace and love of all that is good be with each and every one of you.                                                                    TravelerP.S. The oldest person to hike the trail was 82. Hummmm that would give me about 5 years. Never stop dreaming. Whatever one's mind can dream and conceive one can achieve.,,View Entry,"May 12, Fri",0
Traveler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664345,Short day today. Went over one mountain range and half way up Bigelow Mt  and put the tent up. Only people we saw was aan bigging a drainage ditch and we a crew that just cleaned the camp site . The privy was spotlessly they did a very nice job. Two people were on a section hike up Bigelow and that was it for people . I know we are a little early to start a hike and there still snow on top of sugar loaf. To day we are held up between two mountains waiting for a storm to pass.,"
