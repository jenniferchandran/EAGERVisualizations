Tracey Lewis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663855,"Today I am setting up my new trailjournal. We are getting all our gear together and trying to determine how much to carry. CPAP machine, batteries, and charging equipment will be heavy, but we can't leave home without it.","Home

Tracey Lewis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665155,"Today I went through all my gear, old and new, and made a spreadsheet of what each of us will carry. I wanted to get our base weight to no more than 30 lbs, I am close to 32 lbs each. We are not ultralight hikers, so not all our gear is lightweight. We did invest in a MSR Hubba Hubba 3 (3 lbs 8 oz) so that we have enough room for the CPAP machine and us with gear. I also purchased a two person down bag (3 lbs), I will post my decision about how we like it when I receive it. I am worried that it will be too short as my husband usually buys long bags, and none of these come long. 
Due to the bear issues at certain locations on the AT, we decided to bring our bear cans. They weigh a lot, but we have to hang 30 lbs of food potentially (10 times 3 people). The ropes required would weigh quite a bit as well as the hassle of hanging them each day. I have got food bags caught in trees before, so although the bear cans are heavy (2 lb 10 oz) it is less stressful for me. 

Michael finally finished his CPAP solar charging system! We are bringing Milwaukee batteries to power a portable CPAP machine. The charger system had to be custom made to charge them and to use them with the CPAP machine. I will post pictures of that soon. Although we could stop at different places to charge, we don't plan on spending lots of time in town. We will also be hitting Pennsylvania about the time the Northbound thru hikers arrive, so best to be on the safe side. The solar charging system weighs a total of 3.8 lbs including the large solar panels. The CPAP and hoses weigh 1.5 lbs.

Tracey Lewis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665187,"Today I started the process of treating all our outer clothes with Permethrin. It is a spray treatment to kill ticks and biting insects. When hiking in Virginia, we used it and for about 6 weeks, mosquitoes, ticks and gnats wouldnt land on us.

Tracey Lewis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665553,"Today we started our 2023 sectiin hike. After 24 hours of car and plane travel, we were not really on our ""A"" game this morning! 

We started with a trip to Waffle House, Jessica's favorite breakfast place. It was good as usual! We then went to Walmart for food and stove fuel. That took a while. We dont normally eat a lot of processed food, so finding something we both like was interesting. We both also had different ideas on what to get for the daily meals. We worked it out though. We then had to get a new power cord at best buy for the CPAP machine, check out of the motel, return the rental car and get a Lyft to the trailhead. 

We got to the trailhead at 1:30. By then we realized just how kuch of a toll the travel had on Jessica. She has been recovering from a cold, so had a very hard time hiking today. We went slow and took breaks. We got to the shelter at 6pm. 
Usually that means the end of the day, nope. The spring was 0.4 miles down the mountain, and very steep. We left Jessica at the shelter to rest and went to get the water. At least the spring was flowing well! We filtered 4 gallons and hiked back up the mountain. Had dinner and went to bed. 

Overall, it was a beautiful day.","Frederick MD
",Ed Garvey Shelter,"Jun 15, Thu",3.80
Tracey Lewis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665798,"We woke up to cloudy skies. By the time we were done with breakfast, it had started raining. After hiking for about an hour, the sun came out and we arrived at Gathland State Park. At this point we found out that we were hiking part of a Civil War Historic Trail. The park is a memorial to Civil War Correspondants. It was the home of George Townsend, a famous civil war journalist.


A hiker with the trail name ""Sir Stops a lot"" had brought food and snacks for the thruhikers and section hikers. We stopped and chatted for about an hour and a half while charging a battery. 

One obvious change to our hiking style that will have to happen is stopping during the day to charge batteries. Usually we hike the morning taking hourly breaks, stop an our for lunch, hike thw afternoon with hourly breaks, then stop around 4, and relax. But the charging system we have needs full sun for at least 2 hours so that Mike can use his CPAP machine. We also can't always find full sun, which slows things down. That means more daytime stopping and less time in camp at night.

The hardest part of the day was the last mile to the shelter. It was mostly downhill to the shelter, but it was the first incident where the trail was all rocks. There wasn't really anywhere to put your foot between them, so lots of rock hopping, with a 45 lb pack.

We stayed at the old shelter. It was so nice to have the water source so close. No hiking 0.4 mi down another hill to get water.","Ed Garvey Shelter
",Rocky Run Shelter,"Jun 16, Fri",8.80
Tracey Lewis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665806,"Today was a great day. It was sunny and warm, and there was trailmagic at the Washington Memorial Park. The park is located in Middletown MD and is the site of the first Washington Monument, built in 1827.  Honestly I thought it looked like a old style milk bottle made of stone. 

The trailmagic was more interesting. The cubscouts, and parents, had set up a hiker spread - hamburgers, chips, energy bars, fresh fruit. It is called trailmagic because it is all free if you are willing to sit and chat with the people providing the food. 10 or so thru hikers came to relax, eat, and chat.
It was a great place to sit and charge the batteries with the solar panel. We stayed about 2 hours.
After leaving, we traveled across the ridgeline of South Mountain until we reached Pine Knob Shelter. There were lots of people there so we tented. We ate dinner with some thruhikers and chatted about our trail experiences.Very nice day!","Rocky Run Shelter
",Pine Knob Shelter,"Jun 17, Sat",8.20
Tracey Lewis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665828,"Today we decided to eat breakfast at Annapolis Rocks. It was a beautiful sunny day and the overlook had a beautiful view. We were able to set the solar panel in a sunny spot while we ate and collected water. There were lots of people who had hiked up from the parking lot as well as loys of thruhikers.

Leaving the overlook the trail was beautiful, no rocks, and very easy. We made great time. We collected more sun at our next break and were really enjoying our time together. 


In the late afternoon, the rocks appeared again.

As you can see, the trail turns into a rock pile. We spent the next 3 hours struggling over the rocks until we reached the last descent into the shelter area.
We had dinner then descended to the road at the bottom. From there we hiked a half mile to Ensign Cowell Shelter.
When we got there we saw 15 Outward Bound Camp kids. We decided to tent, thinking they would use the shelter. In the morning we found that they just ""cowboy camped"" (no tents) around the shelter.

We set up the tents and were asleep by 8 pm.","Pine Knob Shelter
",Ensign Cowell,"Jun 18, Sun",8.40
Tracey Lewis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665830,"We thought we had enough sun to eat breakfast at the shelter and charge the battery. NOPE. So we had to spend time later in the day charging.After eating, we went to fill up our water bags for the day. We had 3.5 miles before the next water source, so we got 2 liters for everyone. When it is hot and muggy I tend to drink a lot.
Let me explain our water filtration system, the MSR Gravity Works. The water source is in the concrete box on the left of the picture. I scoop the water into the bag that I hang from a tree. I have a tube that connects the bag to a filter, that connects via tube to a clean water bag. The red bags (clean water bags) are 20 year old MSR Dromlite bags. MSR never changed the size of the fittings on the Dromedary bags, so they fit on the filter system. The filter system weighs 12 oz and each bag is 3.5 oz. Mike makes the picture look good.

The day started beautifully. We found a sunny field to have a break, so we sat in the shade while the panel did its job. Within a half mile, the terrain became very rocky and continued that way all day.

We hiked through boulders, big and small, tough on the feet and joints. We stopped at Warner Hollow Creek for lunch. 
Jessica was having a very hard time with her ankle by this point. In 2019, she broke her leg hiking. When it healed, it formed a bone spur and the nerves were damaged in her ankle. Now when she walks over rocks, she cannot heep her ankle straight and her leg in the correct position. By lunch it was very swollen, and we had the hardest climb just ahead of us.After crossing Antietem Creek, we started our steep 700 ft climb. The trail builders had put in many uneven rock steps to help with the steepest parts. It was a slow climb, but not like New Hampshire at least. Jessica was crying by the top.We arrived at the shelter by 4pm and set up at the tent area. We had dinner (teriaki noodles and teriaki jerky). I was surprised to see how well the jerky rehydrated. It made perfect beefy chunks.Michael and I then hiked 1.2 miles  (there and back) and down and back up another 250 ft for water. It seems that anytime the a shelter is up high, we have to go halfway back down the mountain for water.Not many miles, but a long day.","Ensign Cowell
",Raven Rock Shelter,"Jun 19, Mon",4.40
Tracey Lewis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665831,"Last night we had severe thunderstorms and lighting. We woke to a very wet tent. It didnt help that I didnt get the vestibule zipper closed correctly, so rain dripped in.Jessica had a similar problem. She hadnt slept much and her ankle was still swollen.We packed up and headed for High Rock for breakfast.High rock has a rock and concrete structure at the top that is completely covered in grafitti. There is everything from marriage proposals, birthday greetings, and memorials written there.We set up the panel and broke out the cook gear. Oatmeal was the meal of the morning. We also set up clotheslines to try and dry out the tents.The climb down from High Rock was another rock field. Surprisingly enough, we met an old blind man heading down the mountain alone. He was going so slowly by himself, I wasnt sure he was going to make it (oddly enough I saw him in walmart 2 days later). He was listening to other hikers going by to find the trail. That is one brave guy.We hiked down to Pen Mar Park and had lunch. We called a shuttle and went to the Cobblesrone hotel for showers , laundry, and to resupply. Very comfy! I feel so much better after washing off 5 days of sweat and dirt!Jessica decided to go home. We managed to change her flight and she found a bus to the Baltimore airport. She will leave in the morning.","Raven Rock Shelter

Tracey Lewis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665832,"Today we got Jessica to her bus and packed up. We have to go to a different hotel because the Cobblestone is full for tonight.
We did have fun walking the main street of Waynesboro PA. They have a very active shopping area and mostly all historic buildings.
We found the best pizza place I have been to in years, Frank's New York Style Pizza. They made it perfectly!

We are also dealing with another problem. We have the solar system to charge batteries, bit it doesnt work in the rain. We have a power cable for the CPAP machine, but the charger we brought for the battery (charge via wall outlet) has broken. We spent most of the day trying to find a solution. We have ordered a new charger but we have to spend another day in town waiting for it to arrive via Amazon. In the end, Michael found a solution and charged the batteries using 5 paperclips, the guts from the solar charger and a laptop charging cable! It pays to marry an electrical engineer.

We bought some playing cards because I forgot to have Jessica leave the cribbage set with us.We had lunch at Waynesburger. It is a burger place that also sells BBQ, gyros, falafel and desserts. It was delicious!!The Amazon package came in at 5:30 pm. We will be back on trail tomorrow.","DAYS inn Waynesboro

Tracey Lewis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666003,"Had breakfast at Days Inn and were packed up to leave when Denis got there. Denis shuttled us back to the trailhead at HWY 16 for 7:30 am. Had a pretty easy hike up to Deer Lick shelter. Unfortunately the waffles didn't do us much good, so we ate breakfast again. We then walked another 2 miles and were surprised to find more trail magic! A family that had hiked the trail was putting on a bbq. Luckily they had use of the pavilion because within 20 minutes of our arrival a 30 minute thunderstorm happened. We sat and chatted with the family ( husband, brother in law, and daughter thru hiked) and other thru hikers for an hour and then headed out. The next shelter was only a mile away. When we got there is a beautiful shelter, well maintained with clotheslines and separate areas for tenting and groups. Beautiful spring too. We didn't have 7 more miles of hiking in us so we just stayed at Tumbling Run Sh for the night. We spent the rest of the day playing cards.
Later a PATC (Potomac Appalachian Trail Club) volunteer (Oggi) arrived and told us that the water was bad at the next shelter. We decided to hike the 10 miles into Caledonia State Park the next day instead of breaking it up into 2 days. A few hikers showed up later in the evening.","Days Inn Waynesboro
",Tumbling Run Shelter,"Jun 23, Fri",5.60
Tracey Lewis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666004,"We stayed in the shelter due to the rain. Didn't sleep much. The wood floor was very hard and Michael's sleeping mat kept losing air. We will have to see what Walmart has as a replacement. From now on we will just use the tent on the leaves or tentpad. We were up ay 5 am and out by 6:30 am. Rainclouds threatened rain, but it was a beautiful morning. The fog was moving slowly between the trees, the birds were singing, and the sun was trying to burn through. 
Our first mile was a very steep climb. At the top was Chimney Rocks. We took some photos. The sun came out enough to charge the battery some.

We hiked along all day over fairly easy terrain. The challenge was carrying a whole day's worth of water for the 10 miles. That is an extra 8 lbs of water.

After navigating the rocks
The trail got progressively rockier as the day went on. At about 6 miles, the trail went over rock outcrops and boulder fields. That lasted for 2 miles. It really slows the pace down. The last 2 miles were downhill and had fewer rocks. I only tripped and smashed my knee once. 

Michael heading into rock field

When we got to the State Park, we headed for the campground. I had a reservation, but didnt know where to check in. After wandering around, and following some poorly done signage, I took out my map and found the office. In the end we found that I didn't need go go to the office, just to the campsite! 
We went to the site and set up. Michael was pretty wiped out. He had been tired all day.","Tumbling Run Shelter
",Caladonia State Park,"Jun 24, Sat",10.50
Tracey Lewis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666007,"Today was a resupply day. Last night we took showers and washed our clothes in the sink. This morning they were still wet, so we wore our ""clean"" clothes. In case you were wondering, we carry 3 sets of clothes, 1) sleepware, 2) hiking clothes ""clean"", 3) hiking clothes ""dirty"". We wear the dirty clothes every day. Wet, dry, smelly, it doesnt matter. When we get to a town, we shower, put on the clean clothes, and wash the dirty ones and the sleepware. Then, the ""clean"" clothes become the ""dirty"" clothes, and the freshly washed stuff becomes the ""clean"" set. That is how it goes.We got up, and called for a shuttle. I had forgot it was Sunday, so the shuttle couldnt help us until 11:00 am. So to pass the time, we went to the PATC bbq that Oggie told us about. We met some more hikers and spent an hour eating and talking. I may not lose any weight on this trip! Denis (not the Waynesboro one) came to get us. He was the BEST EVER!  He picked us up at the campground and drove us to the sporting goods store, then picked us up for the Walmart run, then back to the campground. He charged us half of what Uber would have done. Great guy!We portioned out all our food for the week and spent the afternoon talking to family and journaling. It is supposed to rain tonight so packing up tomorrow will be wet. We are still having a good time though so onward to Boiling Spings!","Caladonia State Park
",Caladonia State Park,"Jun 25, Sun",0
Tracey Lewis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666105,"Today we woke up a little late, 5:20 am. We ate, packed up, charged the battery, and left by 7:30am. Today I tried making sure I got lots of different foods in for breakfast - protein/oatmeal bar, fruit, some jerky, some nuts, and coffee. I think the combo really helped to prevent the leg fatigue and muscle burn first thing in the morning.
The map showed a steep climb out of camp, then a more gradual climb for a total of 1000 ft. It was a beautiful climb. The trail was lined with blueberry and laural bushes. It is interesting how the blueberries in the shade seem to be about a week behind their neighbors that are in the sun. We did find some blueberries to eat - yum!
We arrived at Quarry Gap Shelter 2.1 miles in. It was a beautiful place with a whimsical feel. The maintainers in this area really go all out making the shelters feel welcoming. We took a break and refilled our water. 
The next 5 miles were more of the same. We found more trail magic. 5 women who were former thruhikers were holding it at Millburn Cabin. They had cookies and cold drinks. The cold drinks were especially good as it was such a hot day.We filled up our water and continued the lasr 2.5 miles to the shelter. 
We walked through a large stand of replanted pine trees. It was a bit weird as it was dark and there was no undergrowth, except for some blueberry bushes. Later we walked through an area with no living trees that was completely taken over by blueberry bushes. It looked logged but never replanted.
Eventually we got to the shelter. We spent the rest of the evening talking to other hikers. The expected rain finally came but we stayed dry in the shelter. When the rain let up, all the birds started singing. A nice way to end the day.
It was a long day and I am now going to sleep listening to the sound of a very persistant bird…well the rain quieted him down.","Caladonia State Park

It is hard to be quiet on a crinkly sounding mattress! Everyone was up by 5:45 am. Michael spent some time fixing my hiking pole. The strP came off. They are useful when you sweat so much. Your hands get so slippery that you cant hold on when descending a mountain.
The hike today was very gradual. There were some climbs, but mostly the trail ran flat ridges. Much of the area we passed through today was part of a reforestation project. The areas had lots of mixed trees and the plan was to destroy that forest and replant all pine trees. I guess that is what was there before. What is there now is a meadow area with blueberries and laural bushes, mini pine trees, and dead standing trees that werent harvested with all the others..","Birch Run Shelter

Tracey Lewis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666369,"…so I wasnt able to finish yesterday's post due to cellular issues. We hiked into Toms Run Shelter at 1 pm. It is a pretty shelter with lots of tent pads, picnic tables, and adirondak chairs. We ate some lunch and got more water there. We decided to hike down to Pine Grove Furnace State Park. They have an AT museum, store that hosts the ""Half Gallon Challenge"", a hostel, and a campground. Everyone was staying at the hostel and complaining about it. We decided to save some money and just stay at the campground. It is cheaper for 2 people. We did not try the challenge, half gallon of ice cream in half an hour. We had bacon burgers and fries. Much better than ice cream. We met up with Tennesee, a 74 year old who has been section hiking the trail, like us, for years. We had a good time catching up with him again. 
We went to the campground and found an electric site so we could charge the phones and batteries. Showers were so great! Hung the clothes on the clothline and were in bed by 9pm.
This morning, I didn't want to get up. It was very comfortable in the tent and my legs had bothered me all night.  Ut we got up, enjoyed the nice ahower house, ate and packed up. I knew we were going up for several trail miles, so I had lots if calories at breakfast. I ate bacon jerky, a protien bar, dried cherries and coffee. We didnt finish packing up until 9:30 am.
We left the campground and went back to the Appalachian Trail Museum. It was very nice. It explained the idea of long distance hiking, had info on the other 20+ long trails in the US, and the history behind the formation and legislation required to protect the trail. Saw a cool t-shirt I wanted but didn't want to carry it for the next 6 weeks.
We left there at 10:30 am. By 1 pm we had hiked 5 miles. We had lunch at 2 and were in camp by 4. The trail looked the same this afternoon as it did this morning. No notable changes.
We met a family Wooley, his son Rally, and his nephew Snowman. They were doing a week-long section hike. It is nice to see people out with their kids (11 and 15).
We were so tired after two 10 mile days and today's 8 mile day that we went to bed at 7 pm. Good night.","Pine Grove Furnace State Park

Michaels knee has been bothering him. He has been wearing a knee brace to help his kneecap track better. Halfway to Boiling springs I pulled a muscle in my calf. We were so tired too. Today I had all my energy back! 
We had a very pleasant, and mostly flat, hike north today. We passed lots of day hikers and beautiful scenery.

 Unfortunately about one mile into the hike, the muscle pulled again in my calf. It feels like a knot that I just cant stretch out.
We filled up on some water, had an early lunch,  and climbed 1000 ft up in a mile.

We got to the shelter around 1 pm.  We decided to stay, to rest up my leg. Unfortunately, the water is almost dry. It took me 45 minutes to scoop out 4L. But I got it! 
Several thruhikers came by headed for Duncannon.  Eventually we were joined by ""Double nickle"" and her son ""Goose"" and ""Hiking for Charlie"". We talked with them and shared stories of our trip.
Later, a day hiker, Christian, came by and asked if we all wanted a beer. He brings beers up to the shelter every 4 th of July fir the hikers. We all said yes and enjoyed the beer together.","Quality Inn - Carlisle PA

Tracey Lewis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666478,"So last night everyone was talking about the rattlesnake living in the Alec Kennedy Shelter Privy. There wasnt one in the Darlington Privy...until this morning. As i was opening the door to leave said privy, a rope like ovjefy fell out of the roof onto the floor. At first I thought it was a millipede. Upon further inspection, I realized it was a baby ring neck snake. Much better than a baby rattlesnake any day!

We left camp at 7:10 am. We had an easy trail for the first 4 miles. Our biggest challenge was finding water, which we did at the 4 mile mark. It was the last water for 8 more miles! We drank as much as possible and filled the 4 liter water bags. It was supposed to be 90 degrees today. 
We climbed the next ridgeline and followed it for most of the day.

 The rocks of ""Rocksylvania"" started today and really slowed us down. We have about 100 miles of rocky trail, so we will see how it goes.

On the way down the ridge, we ran into the most steep set of granite steps i have seen since New Hampshire. It took us a long time to get down the 1500 ft. On the way we ran into a Dad and a trio of cops who were looking for a missing boy. We hadn't seen anyone matching his description all day. I hope they find him and he is ok.
Tonight we are staying at the hostel at the Assembly of God in Duncannon. The provide food, showers, and a place to sleep, all for free or donation.

Today we stayed in town to resupply and do laundry. Last night we met so many thruhikers, there were 30 of us at the hostel, quite alot. Besides being free and having food for us to cook, it also has air conditioning. The Duncannon Assembly of God has been running this hostel for 4 years now. The pastor says that thousands of hikers have been through here. It is a pretry nice place. Everyone sleeps on the floor, but there is a kitchen, showers, fresh food, and shelter. 

This morning we went to the post office to get Solar's new sleeping mat. He loves it! Then we went to the coffee shop in town while we waited for the laundry to run. It was so nice to have a good cup of coffee. We then went to the grocery. We had to walk up a busy road, but a local stopped and told us how to get to the store safely. So we walked through some neighborhoods to get there. 
Dollar General had almost everything we needed. We saved some money bs going to the grocery. However they did not have bacon jerky or gatorade, so off the the grocery we went! Solar has been having problems finding Gatorade powder with sugar, but he did find electrolyte replacement for kids at Rite Aid that will work just fine. We sweat so much that we need at least 2 a day.
When we got back almost all the other hikers had left. There were just 3 hikers here and 2 left in the afternoon when it cooled off. So just the 3 of us tonight.
After sorting all the food, we played cards and had eggs and hashbrown potatoes for dinner. Solar didnt sleep well, so we went to bed early.","Duncannon Assembly of God Hostel

We met up with a hiker we met at the Hostel and her dog Tilly. We started the 1100 foot hike out of the gap. The temps had started to rise and it was a very hot climb. We did well, approx 1.5 mph, and enjoyed a break at the top. We were very worried about water as the next few days had long water hauls (8 miles +). It ended up being 90 degrees today with very high humidity.

Due to the heat, we struggled to make the 10.5 miles to the next natural water source. All natural sources were dry. Luckily we have been using the Far Out app, so we had read that they were dry ahead of time.

Solar has a hard time going downhill, so the end of the day was rough on him. We got to Clarks Ferry Road at around 5 pm. There is a big creek here so we camped on the banks. 
We saw something I had never seen today. While fixing one of our tent poles, Solar heard a thump. He looked and a king snake had fallen out of a dead tree with a baby squirrel. It proceeded to eat the squirrel, and then climbed the tree next to the one it fell out of, crossed the gap between the trees, and look for the other baby squirrel. It was very cool to see.

Soon after though, it started to rain. At first, it was light, then it became torrential. The trail filled up with water and soon was 4 inches deep. We slogged through the water for another 7 miles. It was cold rain too. I had to put on my rain jacket, not to stay dry...too late, but to stay warm!We met another hiker and Solar asked how he liked the swim down the trail. The hiker laughed and started doing the breaststroke with his arms. It was raining so hard, it looked perfect!  We managed the last 7 miles in 3 hours. When we got to the shelter, it was already full. We had practiced putting our tent up, in a rain situation, in a hotel room. The plan worked well enough. The fly could be set up without the body, so that went first, and the body went up under the fly, protected from rain. The foot print was the ony issue as it got wet befoe we got the body on it, but it turned out fine. We were able to get dry clothes on and warm up. We played some cards, ate some cold food, and listened to the rain on the tent.","Clark Creek

Tracey Lewis,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666723,"Today we actually walked 10 miles including the off trail miles to town. We got up and everything we had was soaked. We were a day behind so our planned Pine Grove resupply was too far away. So we packed up and decided to head to Lickdale to dry out our stuff and get more food.
The first part of the morning took us over Raush Creek and a Rail Trail.

Then we got to cross a beaver pond that the trail crew decided not to build puncheons over. We hopped from log, to branch, to grass, to rock untill we had crossed. We then climbed a 500 ft hill and passed through a previous wild fire area.

we then descended into the gap and connected with the Susquehanna Rail Trail. It brought us to the area with hotels and a KOA campground. We got a hotel room at the SureStay, which is a Best Western, spread our stuff out to dry and did laundry. We went to another Italian restaurant (they all spoke italian too) and had another fantastic meal. So far this is the best Italian food I have had since leaving Chicago. Thank you PA!

Tomorrow is a zero day for reaupply and to find something to fix our tent pole.","Raush Gap Shelter
