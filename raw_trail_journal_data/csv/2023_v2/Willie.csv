Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646232,"Many years ago, I had a therapist suggest that wanting to camp alone was somehow a symptom of some unnamed mental pathology. As I never returned to that therapist, I never learned an official name for whatever pathology it is that makes me desire to sleep in the woods. Perhaps had I been able to communicate to her how peaceful the lovely, dark, and deep woods are, I might have influenced her reading of DSM. Even so, I plan on exploring this ""pathological"" need in 2023.
My actual backpacking experience has been limited, though the 2021 survey of thru-hikers suggests that I am in good company. As a kid growing up in Kansas (and then southeast-ish Texas), my family spent many a weekend fishing on lakes, rivers, and occasional mucky beach. I have very strong memories of poison ivy and sunburn. I can only imagine the moaning and whining my parents might have had to endure had we actually had to hike. Packing and unpacking the car . . . egads! You would think my brothers and I were suffering child abuse not seen since children were first sent into coal mines and sweat shops.
Regardless . . . at some point someone, somewhere (ahem...husband #1), introduced me to three things for which I am eternally grateful: 
Our sonBackpackingNorth Carolina
We actually did not do much backpacking together (one single night trip in Big Bend). But really, that's all it took. When we moved to North Carolina, I discovered trees. Not those scrubby, stubby wind-bent mesquites or lonely willows punctuating horizons. Nope. Claustrophobia-inducing tunnels of trees. Horizons are notably absent in western North Carolina (which I suspect is why people get so darned excited about reaching the top of a bald). I also found eventually that schlepping into the woods with a tent and a sleeping bag and a bag of nuts is surprisingly peaceful--possibly downright pathologically so. Much later, I signed up for an Outward Bound trip in Montana. I'm not Catholic, but ""holy mother of God""! After that, well, my future was set.
So, in exactly 1 year, 50 days, 5 hours, 28, 27, 26 ... seconds I will be officially retired. As will my husband (not #1). And about 6 to 8 weeks from then, I will start hiking. Everyone needs a retirement project, and this is my first (hopefully not last) post-retirement project. My husband, Dale, will join me for sections of the hike. But he is still looking for his post-retirement project, so until he finds it, will help me with mine. In exchange, he gets a *BAT*--Big A$$ Truck--from which he will be running support and laundry services for me from a travel trailer/personal rolling ""hostel."" He will be able to hunt, perform post-retirement consulting, dog care for two elderly pups, and periodic trail angel duties.
Of course, this is all 16 months out. A lot can happen in 16 months. In the meantime, we have embarked on our ""experiments in dehydration."" So far...turkey jerky delicious, dehydrated bananas (ick).",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Wed",0
Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646391,"Much as I would like to claim this entry is about my extreme training regimen, I offer fair warning that the truth is more mundane: it is about food. (Side note: Having read through a number of these journals, I would be remiss to ignore the sheer volume of entries devoted to food. Food fantasies--food obsessions. I am just getting a jump on the topic.)
Since my husband will be running my concierge support service, I am not overly concerned about food on the AT. I spoke with one local thru-hiker (class of 2019), who said he did zero food planning. But, looking forward to future Western trails where the hiker economy is less mature, I thought the AT would be a safe training ground. Add to this the impending breakdown of all social and government institutions with the forthcoming civil war and social anarchy . . . I digress.
I pride myself on meal planning capabilities. Not the 100 meals pre-cooked and frozen variety of planning. The ""I know what I'm going to cook on Wednesday"" level of planning. What I am not given to knowing is what I am going to cook on Wednesday a year from now. So I did what any right-thinking person in this day and age would do: I searched the internet and bought a book---""The Appalachian Trail Food Planner Book."" I was impressed and amazed with the logistical feat of maildrop resupply described in detail with recipes and instruction cards in this book. And then I said to myself, ""Hell, no.""
Nonetheless, I purchased a dehydrator--technically two since the first, depending on whether you ask the US Postal Service or the vendor, was either delivered to an address across town or held up in COVID Customs. I then set out planning meals. ""What do I eat? I like chili. Chili sounds good and is on this week's menu.""  So I doubled my chili prep, added breadcrumbs to the meat per internet recommendations, and set about dehydrating.
A mere 20 hours later: ""Well, that's 6 dinners down. Just 174 more to go.""
Fortunately for me, my husband LOVES vacuum sealing things: food, bullets, anything that needs to be kept fresh. So we persisted: 10 lbs of vegetables, canned chicken, Prego, pasta (see pic). Lessons learned so far:
Okra takes forever (ours went moldy)Peas don't rehydrate well--who eats peas anyway, eh?Angel hair pasta will suffice and doesn't need dehydrating (again, see pic)Dehydrating stuff is a pain in the butt
We now have a collection of 22 homemade MRE's--having added a baggy of quick oats w/granola or dried fruit as breakfast fodder to each vacuum pack. We'll keep on with the effort, but just as with the gear I carry, compromise may be necessary. I know I can't do well on junk food--much as I enjoy an occasional Lance's ""Cheese/peanut butter"" cracker packet, too much and I feel like I've come off a weekend bender minus the fun.
So . . . we'll keep experimenting. Would really like to test dehydrating the jambalaya from one our local shops. Otherwise, I'll learn to be content with crunchy pea soup.

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646556,"I recently finished reading Grandma Gatewood's Walk, by Ben Montgomery. It's an inspiring story of endurance, and for those of us who have reached a certain age and aspire to creating our own adventure in the natural world, it answers the question, ""Am I too old?"" Those familiar with her story know that she puts to shame the ultra-ultra minimalist lightweight backpacker of today. She had a very short ""gear"" list. Her description of bedding down in piles of leaves was notable. Who doesn't have at least one memory of leaping into a large pile of leaves as a kid? (Okay, could be a couple of urbanites out there....) I am not sure of the ""R"" value of a pile of leaves, but I daresay it's superior to dirt, and in a pinch.... So, seems like a great idea. Except . . . ""Ewwwww. Ticks!""
I don't like ticks. On our last hiking trip in Alabama, I snuggled up on a chilly night into my sleeping bag. Just as I began to drift to sleep, I began picking on a piece of debris stuck to my stomach. Could be a random piece of leaf, dirt. ""Stuck pretty tight there,"" I told myself. ""I'll check it out in the morning."" A roll to the left. A roll to the right. Knees curled up. Legs out straight. Like an earwig medley of Kansas tunes it just would not go away.
Five or ten minutes of fixation and double checking, ""Holy Moly! That thing got big. Wake up! Wake up!"" 
My husband, roused from his nice, comfortable sleep, ""What? What is it? What didja hear?""
""Nothing. I got a tick. Get it off! Get it off!""
Groping around ""Big Aggie,"" we found a headlamp and confirmed that nasty, bloodsucking arachnid was indeed celebrating a Thanksgiving-level overindulgence on my soft underbelly.
""OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"" I keened!
Too big for a credit card removal, not that we had one at hand in the tent, the Sipsey Wilderness famously devoid of ATMs. Pulling out my handy dandy Swiss Army knife, my husband--rejecting the knife option and the toothpick--used the pliers to pluck off the offending creature and disposed of it promptly outside the tent, where it scurried away in the dirt laughing maniacally. 
""Tick check. Tick check."" Examining each other and finding ourselves--with about 90% confidence--free of further infestation, we made like bears and returned to our nocturnal hibernation (but not without a few shivers of squeamishness).
So, while I like to keep my options open and survival is goal one, I will say that burrowing into a pile of leaves will be a sleeping arrangement of last resort.",,View Entry,"Jan 27, Thu",0

I account it high time to get to [the forest] as soon as I can.” *
Mardi Gras parades have all finished rolling for the year and Lent has started. No alcohol until Easter, not even on Sundays, though I have been assured that “Sundays don’t count.”  
Assuming we’re not in a nuclear winter come next spring, I will start my long saunter in the woods at the numerical age of 60. My daily perusal of the local obituaries indicates that my peer group is shrinking—fairly rapidly at that, though that’s a purely visceral estimation on my part. In other words, I am no spring chicken and while I am “spry” for my age, I am by no means the picture of fitness. I am in good health, but there is certainly room for improvement, hence the annual 40-day hiatus from demon alcohol.  
A year out, but experience has shown that improvements in fitness take longer and declines in fitness occur faster the older you (or I) get. I remember as a child how the uphill walk each direction to school in snowstorms would ramp up my overall fitness level in a week. Nowadays, it takes 6-8 weeks to accrue much noticeable improvement in strength and stamina, measured largely by how tired I get carrying groceries in from the car. Realistically, I am counting on an innate stubbornness to get me the 2,200 miles, barring tendonitis, Lyme disease, hantavirus, or psychotic break (either my own or someone else’s). 
My husband and I have been doing HIIT/TRX classes twice a week and we run periodically with a local running group (shout out here to Varsity Running). As the light extends, so will our frequency and distance. I always figured if I could run 8 miles, I could certainly walk it. We’re saving the shakedown hikes to next spring, likely as we make our way eastward to the jumping off point of Harper’s Ferry (or environs). 
We live on flat terrain at or below sea level, so training on hills will mean walking up and down the river levee. But my hike is a year away, so I’m saving that effort for closer to “go time” when I am no longer burdened by the daily grind of paid employment. 
I hope to be strong of both mind and body when I set out, but I think the more important accomplishment will be moderating my expectations to meet my capabilities. A lot can happen in a year, but each night I ease into sleep with thoughts of walking on trail through the woods. I think I can. I think I can. I think I can.

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651757,"""Let’s go camping.” 
My husband looks up from his coffee, “Okay.” 
“We can drive out and look at the travel trailers at that place in Round Rock to see if it will be worth the trip out west in September. Take the dogs and car camp.” 
Two hours later, I Skype my husband at work. “There’s one spot open at Enchanted Rock. Everything else is in that area is completely booked.” 
We pulled our hurricane supplies/camping gear out of storage (it’s about that time of year anyway) and sorted. Boy scout mess kits, stay. Nalgene water bottles, stay. Battery operated portable fans, go. Thursday evening we loaded a canopy and half dozen Rubbermaid tubs into the rear of my husband’s BAT*, and early Friday set out with our two elderly dogs.  
As this was our first long-distance foray in the new vehicle—selected for its towing capacity in preparation of our post-retirement role as road wonderers—we spent a lot of time pushing buttons. “Why’s it keep picking up your Pandora?” “I have no idea.” “How do you enable the Wifi hotspot?” “What’s the password?” “What’s that icon on the nav screen?”  
“Traffic ahead.” Sudden braking. “Why’s it telling us to take that road? The map shows this road. Google maps says turn on . . . .” “Recalculating. Recalculating.” 
Several hours and 600 miles plus later we arrived at our destination. 
From the photo you might note that this was the antithesis of ultralight. I recall a time when I could car camp with two boxes of gear, an ice chest, a child, and a dog in a Nissan Sentra. 
“Let’s just put the inflatable mattress under the canopy and ‘cowboy camp’.” 
My husband pulls out the bug netting and asks, “How can we set this up?” 
“There aren’t any bugs.”  
A look. . . .  
“Ok. Fine. Just tie it to the corners. What about this tarp? The wind is picking up.” Picking a side that would provide the least possible impact, we hammered more stakes into the ground. “How do you tie a bow hitch?” Randomly wrap paracord, pass end, create knot. “You have any idea how these tensioners work?” Absolutely not. 
Night one: wind storm. Tarp and bug netting flapping like trapped bats. Awakened at 6:30 am by vigorous bouncing as my husband slips into shorts on the inflatable to avoid exposing his underpants to the rocks. Plan to get up and jog the 4.5 mile loop trail aborted due to a night of tarp chasing. 
“You do realize Round Rock is 90 miles from Enchanted Rock?”  
“No,” I said. ""I didn’t actually realize that. Oh, well. It’s supposed to be hot. Might as well spend the day in the air-conditioned truck. By the way, weather forecast is calling for thunderstorms tonight. Maybe we should put up the tent.”  
“Will the mattress fit in it?” 
We set up Big Aggie: “nope.” But, the tent fits on top of the mattress. We hammer more stakes into the ground then set out to look at travel trailers. 
It so happens that the model of travel trailer we are interested in is sold only in the west. Round Rock is the eastern-most location of a dealership that handles select models from the manufacturer. The actual model we want was not listed at this niche dealership, but it did list a couple from the manufacturer, so our intent is simply to take a look at one made by the same company to get a sense of quality etc. Our plan is to check out a couple of trailers including a used one that is a second choice, grab a hamburger, and head back to the camp site. 
We walk through a couple of trailers, are suitably impressed. As we head to the back forty lot to see the used one, lo and behold: “Wait. Is that our trailer?”  
We ask the salesman if we can take a look at THAT one. “Just got that in a day ago. That’s why they’re not on the website.” 
We leave for lunch, return, and then arrange for a return trip in two weeks to pick up our new travel trailer. 
“Weather radar shows a cell of serious thunderstorms due west of Enchanted Rock. Maybe it’ll skirt north.” Ninety miles later. “Weather radar shows a large line of thunderstorms with quarter-sized hail moving from the southeast right toward our camp.”  
“Where should we hang this other tarp. Wind’s blowing from that direction.” We hammer in more stakes. We hang tarp. “Wait. Wind shifted."" We rehang tarp. “Wait. Wind shifted again.” “Ah...screw it.” Our portable solar crank weather radio says significant chance of damaging winds and hail. 
“Weather radar shows the thunderstorms are dissipating.” 
At 6:30—hiker 8:00 pm—I crawl into the tent and pass out. My husband stays up and enjoys the 15-minute light rain shower. 
Critters: 
5 wild turkeys (I saw 3 out the flock of 5) 3 fawns (all serving as buzzard chow) 1 grey fox (my husband, not me) Various and sundry fenced-in exotic quadrupeds waiting to be shot by monied sports hunters 
Lessons Learned: 
Practice your knots Learn your gear BEFORE you have to use it Setting a tent up on top of an inflatable mattress is AWESOME!

 Everyone who plans a thru-hike plans that hike in the context of a life. Hikers invariably plan around common transition points—graduations or retirements or divorces mostly. A few brave souls uproot themselves entirely and carry their lives upon their backs. But most have parents or children or pets or friends that will share the hike from a distance. And for most, this web of relationships and obligations matter as much or more than the choice of tent vs hammock, quilt vs sleeping bag. 
As envisioned, my hike would include a husband travelling along in a travel trailer with our two elderly canines (a 16-year-old Chihuahua inherited from my mother in 2014 and a 15-year-old Sheltie). Every 4 or 5 days my husband would pull up at a trailhead or road crossing, and we would travel back for a shower and a good leg shave and a resupply. While I pursue a dream down the trail, my husband would be brewing beer or working remotely or finding his own adventures, and we would come back together to share our stories. 
But here’s the thing. We exist in a far more complex context: 
My husband has two living parents in their 80’s, both recently diagnosed with cancer. We discovered last week that our Sheltie has a mass growing on his right buttock. And during our recent (mis)adventure to take possession of our travel trailer, our formerly 8-toothed Chihuahua ran into a chair leg and is now a 6-toothed Chihuahua struggling to eat enough. And while the story of my Chihuahua bleeding on the finance officer’s desk during our paper signing and transforming the gleaming white of the ladies' powder room into a bloody crime scene is—only in retrospective—a little comical, it presages seven months of navigating grief and loss for which there is no app. 



For now, we will continue to hand feed the Chihuahua and help the Sheltie up and down the stairs between naps. The parents are hanging in there. We will continue an ongoing battle with a plague of rats and encroaching bamboo and record heat and, fingers crossed, hope that no hurricanes blow in from the Gulf.

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658896,"Stranger! these gloomy boughsHad charms for him; and here he loved to sit,
It would be fair to say that my first real shakedown hike was unsuccessful in that the weather was perfect (sunny with highs in the 70’s, lows in the 40's). As such, I did not get to test my raindrop avoidance technique or set a misery-trip index value. That’s not to say I didn’t identify areas needing improvement: As a pre-bedtime cathole digger, I forgot where I dug my hole one time, a 33% failure rate.
A small group of 7 from the Louisiana Hiking Club decided to hike this 30ish mile AT section of Northern Georgia, and I saw it as nice opportunity to test my gear and hiking capabilities over multiple days with a genial group of enthusiasts, including one who has thru hiked both the AT (2015) and PCT. While we kept a close eye on the path of Ian, as experienced hurricane survivors and amateur meteorologists, we calculated correctly that at worse, north Georgia would be on the weak side of the storm and get a little wind, and so set off on our planned trek while Florida residents mopped up and mid-Atlantic folk hauled out umbrellas and sandbags.
We hiked 4 days, 3 nights. Distance wasn’t much, but I consider this to represent what I intend as a typical section period: 2 full days sandwiched between two partial days. Shower, shave, repeat. While I was traipsing in the quiet peacefulness of the woods, my elderly Chihuahua babysat my husband at the Helen, GA, Oktoberfest and even took him on a couple of day hikes.
We had been forewarned about yellow jackets and timber rattlers, but maybe the cool weather kept them tucked away in their holes because the only critters I encountered were squirrels and “ba-ar” hunters (two syllables). On our first evening, a lone hound wondered into our camp decked out in radio transmitters and other hunting pack bling. One of our members was able to call the number on the collar, and rumor has it that the owner made it up to Poplar Stamp Gap to retrieve her, but not before she had charmed us out of a bit of rehydrated rice and a couple of pieces of jerky. I say rumor because I was sacking out at hiker’s 8:00 pm (if 8:00 pm is hiker’s midnight, then what’s 6:00 pm?). I’m glad the lady made it home safely.
Though hiking with a group, I usually found myself walking alone, moving as I told one person on my early exit from camp, on “Janet’s Time.” I rather liked hiking alone but meeting up with a group at a lunch spot and in the evening (kind of like a human slinky), so I got a general sense for the whole “tramily” phenomenon. As an introvert, I’m not always comfortable in a group, but I found sleeping in close proximity to other hikers reassuring, even if I did not hang out in the evening around their nightly campfire. 
In terms of equipment, I thought I had packed well. I did carry a bear cannister, which was the subject of some pooh-poohing among my cohorts. We ran into a trail runner at Indian Gap and the cannister started a discussion about the ongoing conversation within the ATC about requiring cannisters along the entirety of the AT. The cannister added weight (2lbs 9oz to be exact), but I didn’t find it onerous. It was certainly easy to stash at night since we were not staying at shelters and did not have cables or bear boxes. My luxury item was my Kindle, which I used daily at bedtime and in the pre-dawn hours before I could decently emerge for my morning constitutional. 
I don’t like hunting and filtering water, which on this section usually involved a .25 mile jaunt down a hill, so I probably carried more water in a pack bladder than most people would. I am short and stubby, and I find reaching around to grab a bottle to drink from awkward, so I prefer being able to walk and suck water instead of stopping, dropping my poles, and struggling to reach a water bottle. For the most part, I would collect and filter water before stopping for the night to use for evening and morning cooking. (One evening, this involved carrying an extra 5 lbs of water for 2 miles to the planned campsite, so this is a process open for improvement.)
My one great discovery was powder milk + protein powder (unflavored) + shredded wheat. I should have pre-tested this combination, but figured I would need to learn to live with poor decisions when the live run starts, so made the decision to “test in production.” It tasted good, the protein boosted the staying power of the breakfast, and shredded wheat does not crumble even while it provides good fiber. Plus, I didn’t have to boil water for oatmeal in the morning. Will definitely be a standard.
So, shakedown hike 1.0 was good. Husband hiked in and met me on my last day and had a nice beer and ribs waiting for me at the end. He IS my trail angel!

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659639,"“Still thou art blest, compar’d wi' me! / The present only toucheth thee: / But, och! I backward cast my e’e / On prospects drear! / An' forward, tho' I canna see / I guess an' fear!”It’s done. Almost. My final day at the office was last Thursday. All physical manifestations of 24 years have been purged. Signs of my existence hidden in code comments and file metadata. I still have two month to burn up all those vacation days I never took over the past 20 or so years, and I do owe “the company” a couple of days to work remotely. But I’m done.
Today is Monday, December 26. My son’s 35th birthday. The first day of my 14-week training plan to get me modestly prepared for the physical vigours of trail. The goal is to build strength and hopefully drop weight. I’m not unfit, but at 60, is it possible to achieve my prime? Let’s just say that as a bookish sort, I mostly deferred my athleticism to my 40’s mid-life crisis when I took up jogging and soccer. My 50’s were marked by a cursory and passing nod to the need for an occasional jog recovered with beer or wine. So now, I am literally setting out to reshape myself into my 60’s.
The plan will be 2 to 3 days a week of full body functional strength training at a local gym followed by moderately long walks (6 to 8 miles). I would like to run at least twice a week (only about 5 miles or so each run) with walks tacked on at the end like punctuation marks. And at least one 10+ mile walk a week. At the end of the 14 weeks, I hope to be putting in 50 miles +/-, though 30-35 is more likely. I don’t plan to train with a loaded backpack; I figure I will have plenty of that on trail. 
My other goal is to establish a post-employment routine that works for me. At the moment, that means getting up at 4:00-4:30 to write for an hour or so while the house is quiet, workout between 2 to 4 hours in the morning, lunch, and then nap. The afternoon hours are tough. As a “lark,” I have a hard time with afternoons. Still working on this one. I have a dentist appointment set to get all my routine dental work done. Can’t help a broken tooth on trail, but can certainly be pre-emptive about any emerging issues. 
We have our first three campground reservations set: late March at Shenandoah River State Park, mid-April at Hosack Run Campground in Caledonia State Park, and mid-July at a campground in Medway, Maine. I charted out campgrounds every 100-150 miles along the AT corridor from Northern Virginia to Maine, though these are the only 3 I have confirmed, as many farther north are not yet open and I have no idea what my pace will be. My husband plans on hiking the first section from Front Royal to Harpers Ferry with me (or at least some of it). We have an elderly dog that requires hand feeding due to a lack of teeth and will need special doggy care.
In short: Plans are coalescing. “But, Mousie, thou art no thy lane / In proving foresight may be vain: / The best laid schemes o' mice an' men / Gang aft agley, / An' lea’e us nought but grief an' pain / For promis’d joy.”",,View Entry,"Dec 30, Fri",0

Three weeks before launch. The last two and a half months have been a daily routine of walking punctuated with two to three weekly HIIT training classes (shout out to Walker and Amber). I didn’t lose any weight, but I certainly got accustomed to the tedium of walking. 
My husband’s mother has become gravely ill, so we are weaving our final trip preparations as best we can into the tapestry of the more consequential work of arranging for the end of a parent’s life. We are still hoping for the March 31 start from Front Royal. We'll delay if circumstances change. (Both of my husband's parents have been ill for some time, so their deaths will be neither a shock nor unexpected. We have already discussed how we'll handle if we need to return home.)
I was not planning on an equipment entry but had an explicit request from an old friend for one. So here goes. Most of my equipment dates from 2016 or earlier. I’ll replace when/if needed, but I like to stick with the familiar. My pack weight in October with food and water came in around 30 lbs. and was completely manageable. Because my husband will be supporting me along the trail, I will be able to swap equipment out as needed, so my planning really only has to be for each 4-5 day section as I will be able to adjust gear during each resupply:
Osprey Aura 50L pack (heavier than some UL packs out there, but comfortable. I even like the noise that reminds me of the sound of a saddle). I have made some modifications to allow me to carry the bear canister. Should this pack need to be replaced, I will take a look at the Mariposa.Big Agnes UL2 Copper Spur (spacious and easy to set up)BV500 Bear VaultEnlightened Equipment quilt. This is new. I absolutely hate mummy bags and wind up unzipping them so I can splay out on my stomach and usually wind up kicking myself out of them. The quilt is fractionally lighter than my current bag (an REI Joule, now discontinued).Thermarest inflatable.I will start with my existing Altra Lone Peak boots (now discontinued), but also have Altra 6 Lone Peak trail runners to swap to when necessary.Sawyer filter with CNOC bag (worked great in Georgia)Titanium trowel and Kula cloth (which I carry on my trekking poles)Stove with small fuel canister, 16 oz pot (used only to boil water), 1L Smart Water bottle, 16 oz jar for cold soaking and/or eating and drinking. Rain jacket, two pairs of “Darn Tough” socks, shirt to sleep in.Depending on season and weather forecast and conditions, I may carry rain pants, insect net, pack cover.Phone, Garmin InReach mini (at least for some of the more remote sections of trail), possibly the Kindle (I found in Georgia that I did actually read every morning and evening, and the phone version is both difficult to read on and uses up the phone battery).
All said and done: I don’t know what I’m doing, but I plan on having a great time. When I was a child, I used to imagine that I was old and on my deathbed and that my reality as it was then was, in fact, my life’s memories. As I am now within spitting distance of my deathbed, I want to make damn certain that I have some interesting things to think about as I lay dying.

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661289,"My husband and I left Louisiana on Saturday in the wee hours to our first waystop: Roan Mountain State Park.  En route, we overnighted in the back field of a local boondocker host in Chattanooga, where we had a restful evening punctuated only by the occasional sound of gunfire (though to be fair it sounded like the gentle pop pop pop of a .22).
We will be doing some dayhiking here at Roan Mountain State Park, and plan on hitting the AT at Carver's Gap on Wednesday. I hope to meet some thru hikers, perhaps even a couple whose journals I have been following. 
All of this sounds so lovely. Bucolic even. Two (ahem) elderly folk travelling the country, living for the next several months in the forests of America as itinerate hikers. And of course this endeavor is the culmination of a lifetime of work and a year's planning and plotting and prepping.
And yet....
If you've read some earlier entries, you will recall that my husband would be protected from the beast of loneliness by two elderly dogs while I seek some horizon point in the woods: Sadly, both pups have died (tumor and kidney failure). 
And a short week ago, we were pulling together the funeral for my husband's mother, who, while 84, became unexpectedly ill and died. His father is also ill, and we are travelling under the cloud of his impending death.

The art of losing isn’t hard to master.

Then practice losing farther, losing faster:
places, and names, and where it was you meant
to travel. None of these will bring disaster.

I lost my mother’s watch. And look! my last, or
next-to-last, of three loved houses went.
The art of losing isn’t hard to master.

I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,
some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.
I miss them, but it wasn’t a disaster.

—Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture
I love) I shan’t have lied. It’s evident
the art of losing’s not too hard to master
though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661451,"Shuttled to the trail from the state park, we got started on trail bright and early (actually, kinda gloomy) at 7:50 from US 522 outside Front Royal, VA. The day started cold (in the thirties) and never really warmed up much (40-45).  Forecast called for light rain and then  wind storm in the night and through tomorrow, so we elected to forego a night of ""flap flap flap"" and make use of a shelter.
We made it to Jim & Molly Denton shelter at 10:19--about 5 miles in--and had an early lunch.
The next shelter, the one we're at, was another 5 miles. Our first day a long one: Sure, why not?
We got here at 2:00, collected and filtered water, and now are waiting for the weather. The day is gloomy and chilly, but we both feel good and are not exhausted, which is a nice surprise. The gunshots in the distance remind us of our recent stay in Chattanooga. The only injury is the grapefruit-sized bruise on my right buttocks from a fall on the icy lagniappe hike we took to Roan Knob on Wednesday.
The trail has been mostly well-maintained but we anticipate a lot of blow down tomorrow.
Not a lot of people hiking: a trail runner, some day hikers, and a couple of SOBO thru hikers trying to get off trail for the same reason we were pushing to the shelter.
Low temp: 32
High temp: 45
Critters: Gray squirrel, a couple of dogs, and a buzzard we frightened in medius lunchus. (We found the buzzard's noonday repast a few yards down the trail: a raccoon head. A few feet away was the tail of a bunny.) We then dodged scat for the next 20 yards or so.

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661640,"Rain & storms are in the forecast for tomorrow (Thursday) and it's move day for us, so I slackpacked 10 miles south from Gathland State Park back to Harpers Ferry. And boy am I glad I did so. That climb to Ed Garvey after the tedious canal walk: I don't think I would have made it going north.
It was very warm today (low 80's) but a nice breeze kept the sweat factor down.  It was a perfect day to walk in the woods. Today was also the first time without my chaperone (husband). It was peaceful and I was able to move at my own pace. The trek southward was either mostly flat or down and despite getting a late (10:15) start, finished up around 3:00, including one short blue trail to Weverton Cliffs. I was eating an apple and came across a doe. We both stopped and stared, almost as though she wanted my apple. She trotted a short distance down trail. I followed her until I could get a picture. She seemed okay with that.
The hardest part of the day was the stair climbing through historic Harpers Ferry. Lots of day hikers out and a few long distance hikers, but most were pretty intent on getting up the trail.
The evening was spent on laundry and food shopping and cleaning, so not sure how my plan to get my husband to handle all the tedious chores is working out in reality. 
I want this hike to be enjoyable. It's a challenge, sure, but I want to enjoy the time in the woods. I'm not approaching this as an attempt to get in touch with my inner wilderness woman, so testing my mettle in extreme environments is not on this old woman's bingo card. I am amazed at the story of all those people who say to themselves, ""I want to hike the Appalachian Trail. Sure I'm old and haven't hiked much and I'm not in great shape, so why not start during a time of some harsh winter weather on very tough terrain?"" Everyone has his or her reasons for walking this trail--mine is to enjoy the journey--but I'm old and haven't hiked much and am not in great shape. Those are three challenges I can't do much about, but I certainly don't want to compound my risk of failure by adding extreme harsh conditions, some of which I can avoid. One day on Roan Knob literally put me on my a**, which is still sore thanks for asking. The idea of doing that same hike with the weight of the pack is daunting to say the least. As a project manager in a former life, I do my best to mitigate risk.
All the above is my way of saying I'm taking a zero tomorrow. Storms and having to move the trailer to Caledonia State Park are part of it. I don't need the zero to recover, but why be miserable if you don't have to. And I won't lie, I do like the bed after a hard day's hiking.

I did pass a group of what appeared to be a church youth group, the girls all in calf-length dresses with leggings and the boys very serious. I would conjecture that a young man walking alone with a young girl in a couple of instances were brothers. They were all very wholesome. There was one other tenter at Pine Knob when I woke up, and Raven Rock is shaping up to be just as empty. I would set up the tent but why bother. Hardly need it for privacy. A NOBO Flip-flopper is a solitary business. It's too early for trail magic there just not that many thru-hikers in April here.

I eat 2 Tums each night. High in calcium, they supposedly prevent leg and foot cramps. I haven't had any cramps to date, so I will continue the practice.

The park itself is huge and we were able to visit only a small fraction in the hours we spent, but we wanted especially to honor the dead laid to rest in the cemetery. The visit was a somber reminder of the fragility of our country.

Random thoughts and observations:
North of Pine Grove Forest, I walked through sections of forest that had burned recently if the smell of char and lack of green undergrowth is an indication. Received an alert Wednesday that Peters Mountain north of Duncannon is closed due to wildfire. I hope today's rain takes care of that since I was planning on hiking that section on Tuesday. Much of the AT is under fire restrictions. Fine with me. I don't actually like the smell of smoke in my clothes and hair.Much of the forest hiked so far has been hardwood interspersed with sections of pine. The hardwood leaves have not emerged so these warm sunny days result in the odd situation of walking entirely in a forest with little shade. This phenomenon is why I hiked the 17 miles: I arrived at a nice campsite at mile 13 at 3:00 pm, but it was hot, nowhere near water, and completely in the sun despite being tucked into a grove of trees. Had it been nearer sundown when the temperature drops or even had there been a shady cover, I may have stopped there, but elected to go for a shelter 4 miles away with water access (mostly to soak my feet).Large sections of forest have appeared wrecked: disease, insect infestation, fire, ice and wind damage. It can be disheartening at times to know that while the trail will persist, the forest may disappear in places along the way.The beautiful flowers carpeting Virginia and southern Maryland have disappeared. There have been very few flowers in the Pennsylvania forest. Only in the past couple of days have I seen some wild violets emerging.With the exception of the areas of pine forest, the trail hasn't really smelled of much. On hot days, you can smell the dusty leaves from last fall. The 3 mile walk along the canal outside Harpers Ferry (BTW: ATC has a ""rabies nearby alert"" for this section--be on lookout for strange raccoons) smelled of creosote and dust. Sometimes I catch a strong scent of ammonia. That could be my pee rag.Speaking of pee rag, girls: don't leave home without it. When your only  choice of leaf is dry and crusty, you may find your shorts filled with itchy leaf debris and a hint of diaper rash. It's a ""will-only-make-that-mistake-once"" mistake.There are two dominant birds that I hear regularly: woodpecker and Canada goose. Cardinals, eastern towhies, brown thrashers, and the ever-popular Carolina wren make appearances, but there doesn't seem to be a ton of spring mating going on yet. Or, I'm just so hard of hearing that I'm missing it. (I'm really just going by what Merlin picks up.)NOTE: My husband says he was able to elicit an actual destination of Maine from ""Down the Trail."" I hope she made it safely through/across the rock maze.","

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662168,"Today's ""gravy"" hike can be described in a single word: bucolic. It was an easy stroll through flat countryside, over field, through small forest buffer zones between fields, alongside fields, and finally a mile along a large creek. Yesterday's rain softened the trail without making it muddy. And the flowers that were missing were apparently only waiting for the regenerating power of an April shower, as the forest bottom exploded with purples, white, and yellows. Even the birds sounded cheery.
I did the day as a slackpack so started around 8:30 and finished up around 2. The day started shrouded in fog but sun began filtering through the new growth around noon. About 4 miles into the hike, I heard ""blam blam blam blam"" sound of a shotgun followed up by ""pop pop pop pop pop pop"" of a handgun. The sound of this gunfight was disconcerting to say the least. My perfectly fine walk interrupted by the persistent blasting away of masculine transference. What I found, of course, is that the AT runs adjacent to a gun range. I did check and saw that the direction of fire is away from the trail, so the chance of an errant bullet is slim.
Farther along I passed a house with what can only be described as interesting signage. I don't know if this person has had problems with delinquent hikers, and the trail does follow the property line on two sides, but could be the owner is . . . paranoid. ""Notice to burglars, carry ID so that your next of kin can be identified,"" ""Pitbull can reach fence in 2.8 seconds. Can you?,"" and then ""If you burglarize this house the only thing you'll get is a bullet."" I would have gotten pictures, but the 70 something owner and his wife were doing yard work and I didn't want them to think I was casing the place.
The forecast calls for more storms tonight, but I will be back on trail tomorrow and hope to get through Duncannon on Tuesday. On Wednesday, we'll move the RV up to Auburn, PA, outside Port Clinton, where we will make a point to visit the nation's largest Cabela's (I would like a second light fleece mid-layer to swap out).

While planning my approach and snacking on a cuticle, a couple of slackpacking overachievers leap past and over and disappear like a couple of harried mountain goats. Slowly I crossed said boulders (and not to spoil the end, likely left behind my tent poles for those forest imps to make merry with).
Getting across the boulders was an interesting challenge on a day that was staying stubbornly gloomy. The rest of the hike was viewless and uneventful on trail that was relatively smooth and easy. Crossed across Peters Mountain that suffered a wildfire last week. The AT blazes survived.

My husband hiked in and met me, and by 11:30 we were on our way for lunch and, finally, ice cream. The sun even came out.
When we got home, we discovered my poles had become dislodged and are somewhere between the Susquehanna and PA 225. As recompense, I found one glove and $0.50 on trail. The tent is 7 years old and Big Agnes says they'll check the warehouse for an old set of poles and get back to us in 7-10 days. Lucky for us, there's a really big Cabela's in Hamburg with our tent in stock (current version). Since we will be moving the trailer north tomorrow, we will be getting a new tent along with a new midlayer.

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662479,"The day started early after a night spent repeatedly climbing up my mattress on the less than level stealth camp. Per usual AT fashion, the day started with a climb; this one lasting for 3 miles. Near the top, I met Dry Bones, a LASHer who started in 2020, derailed at Fontana Dam by you know what, 2021 to Pine Grove Furnace, 2022 off, and this year aiming for Vermont. A few minutes later, I was passed by Mark from Rhode Island, a fellow Flip-flopper who started 8 days earlier in Harpers Ferry. The meeting was brief and left me with a mouthful of dust. 
The next 8 miles were completely without views and consisted of a long stroll through two organic green walls.
My destination was Rausch Gap Shelter, but the flat, mostly smooth trail, meant I would get there at 2:00, too early to stop. Given the long tedium of this section--yes, you all know that the trail can be tedious at times--I was eager to get farther, and realized I might finish the entire planned section in one day.
I must confess that the area around Rausch Gap was a beautiful, cool pine forest and would have been a nice spot to camp. It was refreshing after the previous 8 miles. As I approached the flooded I beaver stream, I envisaged cooling my feet in a nice stream fording. Instead it was an interesting challenge walk on small logs and balancing climb and walk on a larger log across a 4"" deep bog. A diversion from the previous 6 hours.
I climbed out of Rausch Gap up the wildfire-blasted Second Mountain, where I called my husband to let him know I could finish my section. The hike down of course involved lots of rocks, a few missed turns, and the lovely sight finally of my husband who acted as Sherpa and carried my pack the final half mile of my longest day.

I'm no ornithologist, but the size of that hole suggests a very large woodpecker!Because I pushed extra long yesterday, I finished my planned miles in two days instead of three days and converted my NERO (""near zero"") day to an outright zero. The extra time allowed Dale and me to find some KT Tape. My right arch and ankle usually start to ache and then downright hurt after about 4 hours of hiking. (To be honest, I had the same issue walking around the neighborhood in preparation so it's the walking not the terrain.) The pain goes away over night with rest, but I want to stave off the development of any chronic ""...itis"", be it Achilles tendonitis or plantar fasciitis. We'll give this expensive miracle tape a shot.

This sanctuary is apparently on the raptor migratory path. A storm is coming through, which is why I wanted to get off trail early today.

As a bonus, the storm may also prevent the campers next to us from firing up their firepit and blowing smoke into our camper. Karma WILL be served, bucko!There are 114 miles left in Pennsylvania. The next week will be highs in the 50's, lows in the 30's. We have plotted out the necessary strategy to finish off with day hikes from road crossing to road crossing. Dale will be able to hike in southbound and meet me when/if he likes, or he can just drop me off and pick me up. Shelters, water, and camping in this section are oddly spaced forcing either very short or very long days, so we opted for day hiking the rest of Pennsylvania and saving the camping for more congenial weather.

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662584,"Today was the first in a series of slackpacking days that will allow Dale to ""yo-yo"" hike from a destination point, meet me, and transport me to a bed each night until we get out of Pennsylvania (and the weather warms a bit). It was a relatively short day, so we got in no hurry getting out. The storms of the prior day actually knocked out the power (and water) to our campground. Our RV is set up to boondock (solar w/generator) putting us in a better situation than most our neighbors--including fire pit guy (never doubt Karma)--though we had actually drained the fresh water tank so was scraping the bottom of the Berkey canister for filtered water for coffee and to carry on trail. 
I taped both ankles. There may have been some cursing involved trying to contort my feet into the correct position, but I did get some added ankle support taped in place. I started 24 days ago hiking in a pair of Altra Lone Peak boots (now discontinued) that I had purchased in 2016 after a painful loop hike from Clingmans Dome in a pair of ankle-killing leather boots. Mostly they had gathered dust in my closet, but they served me well in Georgia last October and on our initial section from Front Royal to Harpers Ferry. Anticipating some foot swelling and ""growth spurt,"" I had also bought a pair of backup Lone Peak trail runners 1.5 sizes larger than the boots that I had been alternately wearing to break in. When I went to put on my boots, ""What the heck! (*not the word I used). These frickin' boots are too small."" My toes were uncomfortably smashed into the front of the boots (and I am already in the position to lose two toenails). In 24 days I have developed clown feet. (I grieve the time when I wore a size 7.5.) There is no Port Clinton tree in which to throw these boots. 
I hit trail at Swatara Gap at 9:30. Dale drove to PA 501 and started hiking from there about 30 minutes later. The morning was clear, sunny and cool in the 50's. Per AT requirement, my first hour was spent climbing from 450 feet to 1380 feet. So invigorating. In transit, I passed a young woman alone with 3 children all under the age of 3. I would have stopped and spoken, but she was busy breastfeeding the youngest. Houseless? Hiding? Hiking? Then I came upon a man resting. 
""Hey, NASA cap. I think you know my husband.""
""Dale?""
""Yeah."" 
His trail name is Viking, bestowed upon him by Mark ""Roadie"" from Rhode Island; the hiker who had left me two days earlier in a cloud of dust. We chatted for a bit and then proceeded on our separate ways, acknowledging that we would likely meet again down trail.
[On the subject (sore) of trail names: I still don't have one, mostly as there are just so few social interactions. When asked, I refer to myself as ""Nope, Just Janet"" but am toying with ""Rocinante,"" as I seem to be responsible for giving my backpack an adventure. My husband stopped in at the Doyle and the proprietor asked why I didn't stop in last Monday. I guess the ""Closed on Monday"" sign was more a suggestion than a fact.] Perhaps I should be called ""Signs.""
The trail today started rocky and ended rocky--what I envisioned as ""Rocksylvania""--but the vast majority was gravy. The forest was open, and to the east you could catch glimpses of the valley towns far below. My husband met me about at midpoint, and we stopped at 1:00 at the William Penn Shelter for lunch and privy inspection. By the end of the hike, the day had become cloudy and chilly and grey, but hiking with my husband is always a mood lifter (for one or both of us). There were no awe-inspiring views, but every Sunday should be spent worshipping in the God's first cathedral.

Today, like yesterday, started clear and cool in the mid-40's. The sun was bright and warm when it reached the forest path. Also like yesterday, the sky darkened as the day wore on and you went from warm to chilled in a matter of moments.
Unlike most days, the AT did not present with an invigorating climb. Instead, you met with the ubiquitous stones, so if you weren't ""goatin'"" it over boulders, you were river dancing over a trail of cobblestones. Early in the hike I made a gruesome discovery (picture in my picture gallery). I had just read about some cow mutilation in Texas. It couldn't be the same group attacking poor wee forest mice. Could it? Perhaps an owl lost its midnight snack. Don't know, but the sight was disconcerting. I relocated the corpse off the trail. Perhaps some scavenger species will say to itself, ""Well...it's my lucky day. And already skinned.""
""Hiya, Dick,"" I said, as I came upon the man himself--last seen climbing down into Duncannon--as he picked slowly and carefully over the large boulder field. 
""Hey, dayhiker,"" he said. ""This is horrible."" He stepped gingerly onto the next boulder.
""I agree. But I'm more concerned with reptiles."" Let's face it, these rocks are prime reptile real estate.
""They're not out in this weather,"" he assured me.
""I certainly hope not,"" I called as I bounded away. 
I would post a picture of the rocks, but they would look suspiciously like yesterday's and the rocks from the day before, so I'm sparing you the repetition. The sole view encountered was at a spot called ""500 Steps."" But who would notice the valley below when what I was met with was a coven of buzzards? What am I to think? They are gathering and no doubt up to no good.
Otherwise, the hike was uneventful. More miles logged. More forest traversed.

The day started in the mid-30's, sunny and cool. Dale got me to trail early, 6:55 and after a short walk up the game commission road, I re-entered the trail where I had left it yesterday. The entire day from PA 183 to Port Clinton, I saw only two hikers: Viking and Dry Bones (who bestowed upon me my new trail name, ""Willie""). Except for the first mile and the last 3 or so, the trail itself was perfect, smooth and flat. The weather was cool but sunny and it was as pleasant a day overall as anyone could ever wish.
When I met Viking, we chatted about the usual: trail conditions, start, destination, etc.
""Have you seen Dick?"" I asked, having expected to see Dick on today's section.
""I don't know Dick, but I did see an older guy, tall at one of the road crossings waiting for a ride. He's off the trail.""
""What happened?""
""He fell and busted his knee on a rock.""
""He off for good?""
""Looked pretty bad.""
""Sorry to hear that. Easy to do on these rocks."" 
We spoke more and I offered my husband up to slackpack him from Port Clinton, but he was planning a zero. So off I went as he continued to pick his way through the rock field.
The rocks only lasted the first mile or so and then disappeared. Not long after, I came upon Dry Bones enjoying a break. There is a large section of controlled burn area between PA 183 and a game commission gravel road, and Dry Bones had found the first non-sooty log suitable for sitting. We had first (and last) seen each other on Friday. I lamented that I still had no trail name. He confessed that the pigtail braids reminded him of Willie Nelson, so he dubbed me ""Willie."" I'm good with that. Beats TBD. 

I made the same slackpacking offer, and we exchanged contact information. He might just give Dale the opportunity to perform his first real trail angel act. 
Light rain is in the forecast for tomorrow, so I will get out early tomorrow with rain gear just in case. Sounds like nothing more than drizzle. I don't have any weed, so will have to simply channel my inner Willie and chill my way up and out of Port Clinton.

Not unlike Father Mapple, I was pelted by sleet just as I reached the Pulpit today, and then hail, cutting short my view of the far below valley. Anticipating showers, Dale got me on trail by 6:30, where I set up on the long climb out of Port Clinton. As climbs go, it was not as bad as anticipated and was a pleasant divergence from the prior days' rock dancing. Two hours in, light showers fell for about 30 minutes and then the sun pierced the sky and set the forest to sparkling. If you've never walked in the forest after a rain shower when the sun comes out, then put it on your bucket list. The leaves, the rocks, the air: they all glitter. 
I digress. Contrary to the trail maintainers' assurance to Viking that the worst of the rocks were south of Port Clinton, there were rocks. (Never believe the superlatives of other hikers.) The sunshine lasted until I hit the ridge. I was eager to see this celebrated AT overlook. But the spiny ridge was covered with boulders like bristles on a wild boar. As I got nearer, the sky turned grey again. Because of earlier showers, the rocks were wet, and I was not eager to go goatin' across the boulder field. Getting to the Pulpit requires some (read: a lot of) boulder scrambling. Generally speaking, I like boulder scrambling. It's easier than stone dancing. But once I reached the protruding rock and pulled out my phone, I felt the gentle sting of sleet. My rain mitts were doing odd things to the phone's touch screen. Then the hail started.
Janet/Willie, rocks and ice don't play well together so I moved as quickly as possible down the wall of stones. They don't end of course. Not for two miles until the Pinnacle. By the time I reached the pinnacle at 10:50, I was footsore. Frankly, a pile of rocks, large as it was, was not that exciting. (I'm sure there's an interesting story behind the pile of rocks.) However, the sun did come out again just as I was leaving, mirroring my mood.

Just down the hill from the Pinnacle, the AT became a nice clear road--just a few stones--at an easy graded descent for nearly 5 miles.

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662808,"Despite the long planned hike, we didn't get started until 8:00 after a 45 minute drive down some one-lane farming roads and a couple of missed turns to find this remote gravel road. We set out together this morning. I didn't want to cross the Knife's Edge at the end of a long day, so we hiked SOBO in order to start the day out with a bang on fresh feet. Besides, at the other end of the trek was a 3 mile uphill from Hawk Mountain Rd, so we opted for danger over effort.
When you do this section--it is short but dramatic--put away the trekking poles because there are places that will require 4 points of contact. The hike from the road was deceptively rock free, so the climb up and across these rocks comes as a bit of surprise. (Northbound, you will be warned by about a quarter mile of boulder jumping before you get to the Knife Edge.) We made it across unscathed, and my husband enjoyed it so much he went across again so he could drive back to Hawk Mountain Road and do that that 3 mile climb. (Masochist!)

I went forward about a quarter mile and the rocks disappeared for a blessed 6 miles. Power walked through the forest like I was headed to a half-off sale at the local REI. The morning was gloomy but the trail was smooth and clear. I stopped for lunch at the Allentown Hiker Club Shelter--about 8 miles in--and texted my husband about how nice and rock free the trail had been. He responded that the same was true on his end. Yeah. Right. 
That didn't frickin' last. Food in my belly, I set off southward to meet me northbound husband. The sun came out. And then came 6 miles of boulder jumping and rock dancing. I met my husband about a mile or so south of the shelter, and he liked those rocks he had just crossed so much, he did it AGAIN southbound! 
Yesterday, I saw exactly zero hikers between Port Clinton and Hike Mountain Road. Not so this morning. We saw ""Roadie"" (or ""Rhodie""? as he's from Rhode Island)--the marathoner cranking out 20 mile days coming out of the Knife Edge, and Relax, who we ran into in the middle. I also saw a hiker with a dog, passed half a dozen or more backpackers, and even saw Dry Bones. The hikers I met coming NOBO through the extended boulder fields south of the shelter were to a person a dispirited group.

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662876,"Today was about racing rain. Forecast is for a wet and chilly weekend, which does not abide my schedule. We move our RV next Wednesday in our next jump north, and the plan is to be out of Pennsylvania on Tuesday. But rain. 
My original plan was to hike from Bake Oven Knob Rd to Lehigh Valley and do the climb out on Saturday. But poring over the bar charts on the National Weather Service website, I saw that rain today should not hit until 3:00 pm so decided to accelerate my schedule to accommodate two days of storms. (Which I hear developing as I type.) Therefore, assuming I could get to Lehigh valley by or before noon (9.7 miles), I would add 5 more to get up the other side and hike out at Blue Mountain Drive. 
A few observations are in order:
Pennsylvania in generally is pretty flat. But flat does not mean easy. Because hidden in those topographical charts are, of course, the rocks. And traversing rocks is slow business. (If you see the words ""pulpit"" or ""knob"" in the description of a waypoint in Pennsylvania, it means ROCKS.)The AT terrain must be approached like an investment opportunity: Past performance is no guarantee of future return. In AT terms, the condition of the trail you are walking at any given moment can change radically. In planning a section, it is difficult to make assumptions about difficulty simply by looking at the elevation profile. It may start clean and obstacle free, but odds are that in 0.25 miles you'll be rock dancing and then boulder goatin'.
So, southward from the parking lot at Bake Oven Knob Rd is an easy track, then 0.5 miles of Bear Rock and Knife Edge, a few boulder fields, then 6 miles of gravy trail. Northward is 2.5 miles of boulder fields, then 7 of gravy trail into Lehigh Valley. Please take note fellow travellers: the climb to or across Bake Oven Knob is substantively little different than Knife Edge except it's longer and there are no narrow ledges to slide across. Put away your trekking poles for this section. Once you get away from the horror of this section, you can power walk. Heck, I even did a little jogging in my ""trail runners,"" but my pants kept slipping down. With the rain threatening and places to go and valleys to climb, I power walked into Palmerton in just over 4 hours (pretty good time for me). And let's face it, a view in Pennsylvania is usually a view over a valley of farms and small towns and Amazon Distribution Centers. One valley view looks pretty much like every other valley view.
I did make a mistake today.  I asked my intrepid husband to scout the climb up while he waited for me to walk from Bake Oven Knob. He did so, being the great husband that he is. Then he told me about it: the rocks he had to hoist himself onto, the tenuous hand holds, the steep climb. I am not easily scared, but I did wonder, ""if he had problems hoisting himself, what would/could I do with my 5'2"" stumpy legs?"" NOTE: At no time did my husband even hint that I should not do the climb. He knows me too well. Besides, he needed to go find a barber shop to get a haircut. (Looks good, BTW.)
What has to be done has to be done. It's the AT. I said I would hike the AT. So climb I did. Scariest thing I've ever done--and I've hitchhiked in Texas!

I am not a rock climber. I tried it in Montana 20 years ago with a harness and made it 5 feet up. Not a stellar performance, that. But my shoes stuck on the toe holds. I was able to toss my trekking poles up and then chase them upward. For 900 feet. The pictures do not, cannot, do this climb justice. At one point, I thought it had started to rain only to realize I was sweating so badly I was dripping on the rocks. 
Once up, I gave a great whoop, ""Ayeeeeeeee,"" heard only by God and a buzzard. 
I only had another 5 miles to finish for day, now ahead of my schedule.

I'll be back on trail Monday & Tuesday to finish up Pennsylvania, the final 30 some odd miles. Then it will be back to backpacking, my husband dropping me off in Delaware Water Gap to continue hiking while he moves the RV farther up north. I had made up some extra miles on Friday, so I am still on schedule. It has been an opportunity to rest my feet, pick up a better day pack (my little Osprey is fine until you add in rain gear and try to stow trekking poles), and catch up reading my home newspaper (a real shocker: Louisiana government officials are still corrupt).
Pennsylvania is a beautiful state and the people have been friendly and helpful every place we've stayed (excepting that Duncannon campground I tented at, which I found a bit creepy). The hiking has been uneventful and occasionally painful (as I have documented repeatedly). The best view I found was Hawk Rock above Duncannon. The overlook from the top of Lehigh River might have made the cut had I not been mostly terrified. Most other views have been different valley, same view. The predominantly hardwood forests are serene, though beneath the white noise of singing insects there's usually the thrum of traffic from nearby interstates and roadways. This noise serves as a constant reminder that in Pennsylvania, at least, you are really never too far from civilization.
There have not been many other hikers on the trail, but I expect this to change as well. Some of this absence of people is the result of the fact that I'm not staying in hostels. And the past week has been a series of day hikes. On Wednesday, I'll be back to backpacking, though I know my husband wants to continue to join me on some of these hike. Marriage is compromise.
I live in Louisiana where food and drink are a way of life. Pennsylvania seems to thrive on 4 foods: pretzels, ice cream, pizza, and hamburgers. To economize we've limited our trips to restaurants, but many of the local places in these small towns have had limited hours, and the primary options have been national chain restaurants. We were craving junk food after Friday's hike and stopped at one of these chain restaurants, only to have to send the food back to be reheated. The trip to Allentown was in part a search for flavor. (NOTE: My husband visited with some co-workers in Mechanicsburg who took him to a great Indian restaurant hidden in a non-touristy part of that city. I got to enjoy the leftovers.) I would guess the options are more extensive in the cities. 
As a whole, I've enjoyed Pennsylvania. It's picturesque. I am looking forward to leaving it though.

Heading north out of Little Gap (Blue Mtn Dr intersection), first had to board walk over a flooded section, made more so by yesterday's rains. (There were a couple of other sections of trail today flooded just a bit, though the rain also softened up some of the hard pan trail as well.) This was followed by a short but steep boulder climb out of the gap and about 0.5 miles of boulder jumping.
The rest of the trail to Smith Gap was power walking country and made good time for the first 7 miles or so. Met my husband at Smith Gap, and we walked together to have lunch at the Leroy Smith Shelter. The sky began to cloud up, much like our mood. From Smith Gap to Wind Gap, you rock dance:

And flooded trail. I was at least mentally prepared. 
The temps started in the 40's, the sky overcast. Not long into the hike, the drizzle started, off/on/off/on. I donned my rain gear and tramped on. The water accumulated in low spots and in one place ran down the hills and trail from multiple direction into a drainage where it kept running down hill. In places like this, you are thankful for the stones that help to keep your feet above water. I was passed by a father and daughter southbound, but that was it for several hours.
At one point I stopped to water a tree and noticed sleet starting to fall. I hurried to put my rain jacket back on--a Packa that fits over the pack as well--and discovered I had been wearing it inside out. Sigh. With the rain jacket, you lose peripheral vision. So, focused on watching each step and unable to see around, I walked along in a trail tunnel of my own. Not until I got near Wolf Rocks, nearly 7 miles in did the sun break through. I realized the bypass trail was for wet weather, but too lazy to backtrack, I climbed up and across the 100 yards or so of boulders--some slippery. It was slow going and required some butt scooting in places. I thought at one point that I would need to shimmy down a tree, but walked back and found an easier path down. I managed to get off the boulders unscathed and headed to Fox Gap hoping to eat lunch at Kirkridge Shelter. The sun was still shining and I met an older couple headed south to Wind Gap. 
""The rocks are doable, but slick,"" I said. ""And after Wolf Rocks, it's all rocks all the way to Wind Gap.""
""I guess I'll turn around then,"" the wife said. 
""I'm headed to Wind Gap,"" the husband said. He didn't look thrilled at the prospect.
I thought about taking off my rain gear, but I hadn't gone half a mile when the clouds returned. By the time I reached Fox Gap, heavy sheets of sleet were coming down. I thought about the man and his wife and hoped he had taken the bypass. The shelter is half mile in from Fox Gap, and the sleet stopped as soon as I got there.
I ate my sandwich and chips and drank the last of my water. The final 6 miles were going to be long. Fortunately, the trail from the shelter to Delaware Water Gap was rocky for just a bit and then became road walking. The weather stayed grey and would occasionally spit just to spite me, but by the time I started the long climb down back on a trail--one that reminded me with its thick bushes of the Smoky Mountains--the sun had returned. My husband met me half a mile from the bottom and walked me to the truck. 
Tonight we celebrate. Pennsylvania is done. Tomorrow we move the RV up north near Port Jervis. (I was going to have my husband drop me off in DWG to hike on, but forecast is for storms to come in at about the time I would be starting to hike. It would be a short 5 mile day anyway to the Backpacker Camp, so will go north with my husband and start again on Thursday instead. There are also a number of road closures in DWG and navigating the town with the RV was going to be challenging.)

I opted for a zero to get up to Port Jervis area and will start hiking southbound back to Delaware Water Gap (DWG) tomorrow. For whatever reason, there are no shelters in New Jersey for the first 30 miles and lots of camping restrictions (unlike those Pennsylvania hunters who set up camps all over the state game land forest). With more rain and cold in the forecast tomorrow, I decided I would go southward toward DWG. I will have the ability to stay in a shelter for this first night of hiking instead of tenting.

I am currently alone at Brink Shelter, but I did pass a number of NOBO hikers early in the day. And one intrepid fellow carrying a monster pack chaperoning a group of 8th graders.
Today's forest and views were lovely and varied. Made it up my first fire tower (Culver). Will load video when I get bandwidth. The trail itself however was frequently channeling Pennsylvania, and I believe I crossed many a sister section of that stretch between Stamp Gap and Wolf Rocks.
Mist and drizzle dominated this morning--starting out at a brisk 40*. There was brief sunshine climbing out of Culver's Gap around 1:30, but otherwise the clouds have won. Had I been hiking with a companion, I would have stopped at a trailside tavern/restaurant, but, alas, passed it up, my Kindle being buried deep in my pack. Tonight is forecast to be the last evening with rain, and then this damnable meandering cold front is supposed to swirl itself out to sea, leaving us with warm and sunny (seasonable) weather.

After 15 miles or so today (campsite isn't marked on AWOL, so have to estimate), I am tented at the top of the ridge, so should be limited climbing tomorrow into DWG (~10 miles).
The closer you get to Pennsylvania, the more the trail is like Pennsylvania. Every through hiker I passed lamented the fact including two Springer starters, and we're disappointed in my northern trail report. There were a couple of miles near Culver lake that were nice.
Views not as good today, but first half was spent in a fog. The crazy off/on showers started up around lunch and each time you thought it was safe to remove rain clothing, the sky would darken and a deep voice would reverberate throughout the hills, ""Just what do you think you're doing, Missy?""
I thought I had lost my cap used to keep rain off my face. In all the many pack on/offs it had gotten misplaced. I was sorely bummed until I went to remove my pack again and found it tangled up beneath my belt and rain jacket. Forest imps strike again.

Was up early. Good thing too. At 6:15 a stream of 10 hikers passed my stealth site. Just a few minutes earlier and they would have been greeted to a full moon rising with the sun. Was out by 6:30 headed southward toward Delaware Water Gap. The weekend's beautiful warm and sunny weather brought out the hikers. The trail was busy. Probably the nice weather but the rocks--at least initially--didn't seem so painful. (Somewhere along Sunfish Pond bank, I was hoping for an airlift.)
I surprised a family of deer on trail. Youngster wasn't at all threatened by me. He and I chatted a bit while mom & dad watched from a safe distance, and then we all went on our merry way. I'm afraid the turkey pictured did not have such a good day, but the hunter was very happy. He told me he had walked 16 miles for that turkey.

After a heavy (and overrated lunch, IMO) at the Apple Pie Bakery, my husband dropped me off where I had started on Thursday (Deckertown Turnpike). From there, I hiked the 5+ miles to the High Point State Park Headquarters. Tomorrow, I'll head north from there to finish off New Jersey. My husband did a little recon on the northbound trail.

I'm not sure what's blooming--honeysuckle perhaps--but there was a sweet springtime smell in the air.
Much of the trail was flat and rock-free, though the 440' climb to the shelter was a reminder of days to come.
Early I passed a troop of young boy scouts headed up the rocks to High Point Veterans Memorial. One poor tyke was sporting an external frame pack too big for him and too loose. I thought he would topple over on his climb as he wheezed and grasped his knees.
A couple of locals warned me of the flooded swamp and bypass, which has been blazed. And my husband met me at a road crossing with lunch and cold water. What a trail angel he is!
The wet and warm has brought out the insects. Ticks are abundant. After each pasture crossing I picked several off my pants.
Most my exchanges on trail have been with locals, one of whom suggested the clear safety glasses to keep gnats out of the eyes. I am testing in production.

Of course that was only after a frantic body search for ticks. The fields are alive with ticks. And so was my buff and my pants. I picks, plucked, and scraped. Every mole and skin imperfection inspected for 8 legs. Every 15 minutes or so during the day I would remove the buff I use to keep my Willie Nelson-esque hair out of my face and pluck away the hitchhiking arachnids (rat b******ds!).
Once satisfied that all visible and reachable body parts were tick free, I started the typical AT day with an invigorating climb up Pochuck Mountain. Then down into a march alive with song of red-winged blackbirds, swamp sparrows, and warblers of various type. This boardwalk gave way to a field of cows, all at a distant. I did not approach. Across the road from the bucolic pasture redolent with the smell of organic cow waste, is the parking lot for the Stairway to Heaven.

A southbound LASHER couple gave me the advice, ""Take it slow. It's tricky."" 
I didn't find it was particularly tricky, but like the song, it did go on a bit. And at each switchback, a voice in the trees would whisper, ""But there's more!""

My legs were spent, so I plodded on, not far from my destination of Wawayanda Shelter. I saw on the Whiteblaze pdf that there would be the possibility of ice cream or hot dogs at the next road crossing with minimal detour needed. Didn't really put a pep in the step, but I did have the hot dog order all ready in my head. I stopped at a stream and soaked my feet, picked a tick off my ankle, and then climbed up to to road. Unfortunately, I had crossed the road with the ice cream and hot dogs BEFORE the climb to heaven. My rapture was short-lived.
On I trudged to the shelter to eat my tuna fish wraps. I did meet with Twister and Ms B, two section hikers I had given directions to two days earlier as the climbed out of Culver Gap. (They told me the chicken sandwich at Mountain View is quite good.)
I contemplated another evening of tick chasing, real and imaginary and opted to have my husband pick me up at a road crossing, a mere two miles hike away. I'll slackpack tomorrow. I like a good night on a small inflatable mattress as much as the next person, but as far as I know, the bed in our travel trailer is not infested with blood suckers.

We got started late (9:00), my husband dropping me off where he found me yesterday, tick dejected and foot sore. I will admit that I thought the day would be a slog. 
But the weather was cool, starting in the 50's and the sun bright. I retaped my feet to alleviate some soreness in my Achilles and started with a gentle AT warmup climb. At the top, I encountered the first of multiple rock climbs, even one requiring a climb up a rebar ladder. It was not long before I crossed the NJ/NY state line and was atop Prospect Rock, the highest point on the AT in New York:


Dale just wanted a butt shot

Hiking is more fun with those you love
Dale was hiking in from Lakes Rd and we were going to meet for lunch at the hot dog stand on 17A in Bellvale with an ice cream chaser. We had not packed anything but a few snacks. When we up the side trail to 17A, we discovered that for the second day in the row, my hot dog desires were thwarted. Thwarted! 
Ice cream for lunch it would have to be. Please note: the ice cream was delicious.
We ran into Twister and Ms Betty (you may remember her as the hiker dubbed ""Down the Trail"", since this was her only response whenever you would ask her her destination) also enjoying some dessert for lunch. I had met them yesterday at lunch at the Wawayanda Shelter. They were headed down the road to tent at the drive-in theatre.
Content with ice cream, we headed down the trail with some more pep in the step, but we decided to drive to Warwick for some Greek food that a local hiker had recommended to Dale. We would then return and I would add some bonus miles, as the hiking had not been as difficult as I had thought it might. By the time we were at the restaurant, it was already 4:00. The most delicious food and the beer were a nice finish to a day. Those 5 miles will be there on Thursday when I return to trail. (Tomorrow is laundry day and rest & recovery.)I might also add: not a single tick sighting. Perhaps they stopped at the state line.

We got started before 8:00 and walked in to see Fitzgerald Falls (ok). Then proceeded on to find a view (nonexistent). My husband turned around to start hiking in from the end point.
I ran into 3 couples of southbound LASHERS--somewhat spread out but travelling together. The first couple: ""Be ready for hitting some stuff. You'll run into 4 more people. Let them know you saw us."" The second couple: ""There's some tricky stuff ahead. I left a blood trail."" (True) The third couple, rearranging packs and gear: ""The climb ahead is tough. Be careful.""

The referenced climb was Buchanan Mountain. It did require the use of hands, but was likely worse coming down than going up. After lunch enjoyed on a warm rock overlooking trees, I attacked Agony Grind. The hike down was both. By the time I hit Harriman State Park, I was plodding on my sore ankles and feet.
I ran into Twister and Ms Betty lunching streamside. We chatted a bit and they, carrying full packs, were also wore thin. All three of us got up to attack the climb up. Just as we headed up, I saw my husband heading down. I waved him to stay, but he walked down to Twister & Ms Betty to warn them about the climb above the lemon squeezer. He warned me that he had had to lower himself down off a ledge and was not sure how to get back up.
We climbed together slowly. I was looking forward to this iconic site. Made it through without too much stomach sucking and approached the climb. There is a blue-trail bypass, but I opted for the climb challenge. 
I looked at the rocks. Cocked my head left. Cocked my head right. And grabbed hold of the closest stone hand hold and hoisted my left leg, then my right leg onto the slimmest of toe holds. Then just up I went. My husband watched, then followed. Then I made him go back around the blue trail so we could re-enact the climb since he didn't capture it on camera the first time.
He kept promising easy rolling hills to the 3+ miles to finish. They did materialize with about 0.5 miles to go.
We then drove what we thought would be an easy 30 miles to the REI in Paramus for a pack that would allow me to carry the bear canister inside. (I have been carrying the canister strapped to the top of my pack which is fine for walking up and down hills. But it changes my height from 5'2"" to 5'7"" and throws off my center of gravity, making climbing and navigating some these trickier descents a bit unbalanced.) Paramus is a traffic nightmare.

The ups were gentle; the downs were uncomplicated.For lunch, my husband stopped at a deli and brought forth two meat-laden wraps just oozing with protein, which we ate at the picnic table at the Anthony Wayne recreation area off the Palisades Parkway. As many AT hikers are aware, this section has been detoured to a safer route to avoid thru-hikers' being mowed down like possums trying to negotiate a road crossing.Overly sated, I set out to finish the detour and hook back in to the official AT. The topo profile was itself a bit of a mystery, as the AWOL Guide, from which I pull my mileage numbers, did not reflect the detour changes even though it noted it. I was aware, however, that there would be the need to climb West Mountain. And climb you do, ladies and gentlemen.

I ran into Drunk Dynasty at the top of West Mountain, where we looked across at the tower atop Bear Mountain and sighed. Our mood was buoyed by the discovery of two mandarins, left on a rock looking for takers. And take we did, gobbling them thirstily on this hot, dusty day. We hiked together and chatted and stair-mastered our way up Bear Mountain. My husband appeared just as we neared the memorial tower site, where luck held and the vending machines were stocked with COLD drinks. On our way down to the parking lot we passed Rod. I asked in passing where he was staying. He said a local inn. I asked if he needed a ride, which he accepted since his destination accommodations were uncertain about transportation. We had just dropped him off when I received a phone call: ""Do I know someone from Michigan?"" I asked my husband. ""Oh, that might be Betty.""Indeed it was. Betty and Twister were just down the road at the same picnic table were my husband and I had lunched; they  needed a ride to their hotel, as all the Ubers were unavailable.

It was no Audubon Zoo in New Orleans, but it was charming. We took our time and got pictures of various birds and probably (hopefully) the only bears I will encounter on the trail.

After a stroll across the Hudson, there was a hike up. It was the only climb of consequence in a day of relatively easy trail. Don't get me wrong. Canipus Hill threw in a few Pennsylvania nostalgia moments, but hiking today was enjoyable. My husband met me with lunch at the Appalachian Market. He was continually thwarted by restaurants with odd hours, but finally found a most yummy chicken mole and Mexican shrimp dish from La Hacienda in Highland Falls. (A Google search and phone call had indicated that a different Appalachian Market closed permanently, so he drove around searching for something other than a deli to bring for lunch. I christened him with the trail name: ""Above and Beyond"".) The REAL Appalachian Market, gas station, is in fact open and operating with a wonderful array of blessedly COLD drinks.
I took a wrong turn coming down the hill to the market. (I swear that blaze was a left turn!) I got lucky with some forest gnomes out rearranging stones who set me back on the correct trail.

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664169,"Returned to trail a bit late, 9:30, which was fine, since I ended early (3:30). The next campsite is over Bear Mountain. I am not confident enough to attempt the descent late in the day on fatigued legs. Some things are better tackled when you're fresh.
I intentionally planned this transition into Massachusetts to be short recovery days. The next week or two will see lots of elevation changes, and no point being miserable on dead legs. 
No one else is here at the moment. I passed a few day hikers. I expected to see more on a Sunday, but the sunny warm day materialized only in brief moments. The shelter has been dismantled and campsites are pretty dispersed. I found one reasonably level, but pickings were slim.
The hiking today has been peaceful if a little cloudy. The trail was mostly soft treading with a few interesting twists.
Tomorrow will be another short day summitting both Bear and Mt Everett. Will meet Above & Beyond at The Hemlocks Shelter to celebrate our 12th anniversary.

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664255,"Woke this a.m. and decided that I would prefer to celebrate my anniversary some where other than a tent sleeping on an inflatable mattress that sounds like crinkling cellophane each time you roll over. Since I called my husband and told him I would just consolidate the two short days I had planned and we could enjoy our wine and charcuterie in the comfort of our travel trailer. He took little convincing.
You know what Robert Burns says about plans. 
The morning hike started with a surprise encounter with a porcupine. I don't hike with my glasses, so it took me a minute to process the creature before me. I thought at first it was a small bear cub. I think the porcupine was also a bit short sighted so we stared at each other a bit.  I asked him politely if I could pass, and he ambled into the underbrush. He did not go in far enough for my liking, so I asked if he might just give me a bit more space. He accommodated my request and I went my merry way as I am sure he went his. It was the first porcupine I had ever seen outside of a zoo. He seemed nice.
The summit of Bear Mountain (CT) was not particularly difficult. The view was big. On top was a pile of stones. There was a stone plaque that you could just make out: ""This marks the highest point in Connecticut"" (2,316'). As easy as the climb up was, the climb down was nearly as precipitous and difficult as the climb down St John Ledges.
I soon crossed the state line into Massachusetts where I was struck with the beauty of Sages Ravine. One cascade of manyThe trail was flat though rocky in places. It soon (too soon) gave way to a loooooong climb up Mt Race. It looks innocuous on the AWOL view, but the climb to the summit was over long stone slabs. (If you are afraid of heights, there are a few spot that might give you the fantods.) That climb down was immediately followed by a harrowing climb up Mt Everett. This is a steep climb UP stone slabs (with a stream of water making certain options untenable). In a few spots (not enough in this writer's opinion), wood blocks have been bolted into the stone to help you up some of the smoother slabs. There is about 500' elevation increase in 0.7 miles. Luckily, the descent was not as harrowing, but did require some careful navigation down boulders reminiscent of Pennsylvania. 
You drop into a lovely hemlock forest with a carpet tread. Don't get complacent. That descent down to Jug End Rd is a veritable landmine of steep drops over boulders. Again, looks easy on paper, but Mt Bushnell descent is painful. 
By the time I hit the marsh walk to Sheffield/Egremont Rd, my feet and ankles were screaming. The long walks with a foot at 30-45 degree angle, the steep steps down, the arch bruising tree roots. I confess. Those 4 mountains kicked my butt.
But there were a couple of nice views. You just have to pay the toll.

It was sobering and moving.
My experience yesterday has convinced me that I need to approach Massachusetts like Pennsylvania: slackpack to protect my ankles. Farout has some recent reports of bear activity around Tom Leonard Shelter and Shaker Campsite. And--as we are currently camped 3 miles from the AT crossing of VT9--I can attest that the bugs are getting vicious. Mosquitos attempted to kidnap Above & Beyond near Sheffield Egremont Rd!

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664374,"The torturous terrain of the first day in Massachusetts gave way today to smooth trail. There were ups (nearly 3,000 feet of them), but there was also soft, rock and root-free trail. 
Above & Beyond drove me back to the site of the final battle of Shay's Rebellion where I set off--with just a bit of trepidation about what the day would entail--at 8:45. We planned on meeting for lunch at Tom Leonard Shelter (site of a recent bear box burglary attempt). There were two 500' mountains ascents before I could lunch on my PB&J. From the AWOL guide, you can only see the lines and numbers. What you can't see are the various obstacles on the path. 
Today, there were none. Easy peasy lemon squeezy. In the interim, I sent hubs in search of shoe inserts available--according to all-knowing Google--only at a running store in Pittsfield or a specialty orthotics shop. My current inserts have served me well, but have exceeded the 500 mile mark. I am committed to NOT developing any chronic ""-itis"" in my feet or ankles that would sideline me completely. To that end, I'm scaling back my daily mileage a tad (not that it's particularly exceptional) and taking advantage of the family shuttle services. Replacing the inserts will, I hope, add a few extra miles to my days, just as the KT Taping has done.
Did not encounter many hikers on trail today. Passed a LASHER (Lean To) headed SOBO on a leap-frog section. There was another hiker from Arizona at the shelter hiking to fill in some AT gaps. Otherwise, only met a few day hikers just as I was coming in to Beartown State Forest.
There were no notable views (except on the drive home). And we got off trail just before the forecasted rain and cold front moved through. The forest is redolent with the smell of this pink honeysuckle. I did take an obligatory photo of a valley from East Mountain, the second of today's climb.

We're not talking Pennsylvania annoying, but just enough to make your walk in the woods a practice in obstacle avoidance. And we know what that means: it was pretty exhausting for what looked to be a relatively easy section. There were two climbs: Bald Mtn (first thing in the morning) and then Becket Mountain. And of course random ups & downs. There was a lot of work to trudge through the green tunnel. You pass two ponds on this section. The first is Goose Pond. The second is Finerty Pond. Above & Beyond and I took the 0.5 mile detour to have a look at the red cabin in the woods next to Goose Pond. (This did look like a nice place to spend an evening.

Got on trail around 8:30 (late because there are no fast routes to trailheads in Massachusetts). Ran into Lean To [Two/Too] who was hiking from the Kay Wood Shelter. I had met him a day or two earlier travelling SOBO. He's leap-frogging himself up the trail. Spoke to a local hiker who said he had just returned from Northern Vermont and indicated that there's still snow on the ground in New Hampshire.
Headed up to Mark Noepel Shelter, which is situated about 3/4 of the way up Mt Greylock. Above & Beyond (Dale) was going to park and hike from an area on the mountain to make sure we had a space at the shelter. I made it to the Cobbles and stepped off to see what I could see. (Nothing.) I wound up losing the trail (like many local hiking areas, there are multiple trails radiating off of a designated view). I had hiked about 1/10th of a mile when I ran into Lean To coming down. Oops! I turned around to head back northward and hiked into Cheshire with Lean To. 
We stopped at Father Tom Campsite for lunch. He said he was meeting a hiker named MC Yogi, who would be staying at the campsite for the night. I said I hadn't met MC Yogi yet, but when we saw a hiker and called him over, I saw it was a hiker I had been calling ""Arizona,"" based on the fact that my husband had met him a couple of days earlier and said he was from Arizona. I had been passing him for the past 3 days and each time would call out, ""Hi, Arizona!"". He is in fact from Albuquerque, New Mexico, and so was understandably perplexed as to why I kept calling him Arizona.
I watered up and used to porta-potty at Father Tom but didn't take advantage of any of the other amenities such as charge station, bicycles, hammock posts, and then set off to the shelter. 
Mt Greylock puts the wild back into Massachusetts wilderness. It was not a tough climb, but the forest was unkempt. When I arrived at the shelter, it was quite the madhouse. I was glad Above & Beyond had gotten there earlier. The site was packed with a group of boarding school kids out of New Lebanon on an end-of-year hiking trip, replete with decks of playing cards and metal water bottles. We managed to get a spot at the picnic table--ok, the trip chaperone booted a couple of kids out--ate our dinner and then climbed into the tent to avoid the emerging bugs. Dale was out by 6:30. I managed to stay awake and finish my book.

The trail eased up a bit with roots and rocks that were barely noticeable. I passed my 7 mile jumping off point at 10:00 so moved forward committing to the full 18 to VT9. Crossing the stateline was a definite morale boost, and I traipsed up the trail with a bounce in the step (it was still morning; my afternoon gait has a bit more limp to it). 
And then I was laid on the ground. I was taken down by a stick.[Insert curses here.] I do hope the forest imps are satisfied with the little bit of blood from my knees.

My watch tells me I did a tad over 4,000 feet, but this section is not particularly difficult with two exceptions: the aforementioned rock climb and the steep rocky descent to VT 9 (there are indeed rocks in Vermont).

My husband--as concierge shuttler--spends hours poring over maps and Google satellite views to find the best route to the myriad remote pick up and drop off points. For those of you like me who are not familiar with Vermont, this state of 600,000 is wilderness with a few settlements. There are not many roads, especially running east/west, so to get to some small towns requires a long circuitous route followed by miles on dirt roads. We had found two access points to Stony Brook Rd: one from the south and one from the north. We took the one from the south, since it was near River Rd, which was a road that the AT would cross. Some of the roads we travel are better than others. This one was tucked up at the back of a business and was a single vehicle rocky track straight up Quimby Mountain. On the driver side was a sheer ravine. On the passenger side a sheer mountain cliff. Up up up we drove, taking full advantage of 4-wheel drive and high clearance. We came to fork and began zooming in on the nav system. Surprising us, another vehicle came up behind us. We told him our destination, and he indicated that the gate to one of the connector tracks (No Town Rd) was likely not open. 
Somehow, my husband got us turned around and down down down the mountain we went. We then drove a long circle north then back east until we found the northern entrance to Sandy Brook Rd, right off VT107. This end was in better shape and we noted that there were houses with mailboxes and powerlines. Obviously this road is in use.
We came to a closed gate and saw that we were about 0.5 from the trailhead, but a warm up road walk would not kill us. Donning our packs, off we set. At about 0.5 miles up, we checked and saw that we had, in fact, taken the wrong road walks. Down down down to the truck and then up up up the other fork of the road. 
We came to a footbridge over a stream with the white blaze, so across the river and up the hill we went. It was nearly noon. We were planning to stop at the nearby Stony Brook Shelter for lunch. We pulled out our phones and checks. Lo and behold, we had headed north instead of south. So down down down the hill we trudged, back across the footbridge, and then up the trail.
Having finally gotten oriented, we started what turned out to be a very long short hike day. Above & Beyond hiked up to the powerline (about 3 miles) to look at Mount Killington with its few patches of snow still showing. I continued on. The remainder of the day was uneventful. Passed some lovely falls off of River Rd (Thundering Falls)  and some more near Kent Pond. Was able to get some cool fresh water at Gifford Wood State Park and finally finished on Rt4 around 5:30 pm.

There were plenty of climbs the first half of this section, but the trail overall was nice and soft and easy on the feet. Took today slow. Met up with a LASHER, Heather, at the top of the Pomfret climb. Enjoyed the rest of the day in her company and had enough pleasant conversation to make the drippy day a non-issue. Only a few sections of trail were slippery. There are couple of pasture crossings--read: ticks (2), but the forest was lovely, dark, and deep.
Finished up in West Hartford at 4:00 just at the start of a Farmer's Market. Picked up some home-baked bread and scones (delicious!) and grabbed a cup of coffee to warm up after the hike.
Today was a day made for salamanders. Saw lots of efts enjoying the wetness.

We walked neither far nor fast, but a day spent in the woods among good company heals the soul (and soles). I had planned a zero for today, but Saturday is shaping up to be a gullywasher, so set out this a.m. on a last-minute hike. Met with Heather and Jane (working for the summer at the hostel in Norwich) at 3 Mile Rd. Above & Beyond joined us for the first 4 miles or so southbound back to Hanover. 
The weather, like the surrounding forest, was clear. (Storms are springing up in the late afternoons.) The forest floor was covered in emerald green ferns. The trail was soft, occasionally criss-crossed by tree roots, but the walking was easy. Conversation meandered from random topic to appreciative ooh's and ah's regarding the surroundings.  Several hikers sprinted past us northward toward Moose Mountain, but we kept to our leisurely meander southbound. Later, we met a day-hiker, Curt, in Hanover visiting his daughter filling time while she worked, and he joined us to the end, posing the parting question: ""Is a hot dog a sandwich?""
Crossing down the Velvet Rocks, it felt as though the forest had swallowed the sun on the dark cool forest floor. Popping out in the bright sunlight surrounding shining over the Dartmouth practice field was a system shock. We all went our separate ways. I met back up with A&B and we returned to Molly's to enjoy the $3 margaritas.

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665595,"Picked up Jane and Heather from the hostel and headed to where we had stopped yesterday. Heather had gotten someone to help retrieve her car, so it was sitting at our end point. Having the 2nd car meant Above & Beyond could hike the full section today. 
The 4 of us set out on the first climb up Moose Mtn. We did not see any moose--not so much as a moose pile--but up top we got a hazy view of the presidentials to the northeast. Down we went and then up a steep climb to Holt's Ledge.  There were more views and steep cliffs.  We ate lunch about half way up. Jane has a background in plants, so it was so nice to have someone along to do plant identification. The forest is full of flora that is novel to someone from down south.
The day was warm and all of us were out of water, so stopped at a stream and filtered 4 liters. With all the rain, you would think the streams would be full, which has not really been the case along this stretch. We finished up around two.
Tomorrow is a zero (lots of rain in the forecast). Heather is off trail to tend to personal business for a bit. It has been a nice couple of days hiking with other people. I proposed a trail name for Heather--""Podcast."" She is so good at keeping a conversation going over a huge range of topics. Plus, I don't have to fire up a podcast to power myself up a steep climb. She's thinking it over.

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665674,"After yesterday's rainy zero, tackled a double-header of Smarts Mountain and Mt. Cube. The day was supposed to be cool and partly cloudy, but the sun never managed to show itself for any length of time. We got started early--7:30ish--climbing up in a fine and dreary mist. The trail was muddy and the rocks were slick, making progress for the entire day pretty slow. Much of today reminded me of the slab climbs of southern New York. But because of the dampness, you had to find footing along the edge instead of goat trotting straight across the stones.
We reached the top of Smarts Mountain, but didn't bother to climb to fire tower.The atmosphere was very similar to the Smoky Mountains with the tops of the mountain wrapped in the clouds. We took a short break at the Fire Wardens Cabin along with TLC, Raccoon, and a third hiker (name missed). It was nice to get out of the damp, but sitting too long, even in a closed cabin, was chilly, so we headed out. 
Above & Beyond followed for a bit more up trail (until a mud hole pulled one of my shoes off my foot). At that point, he turned back and headed down the Ranger Trail (he does not recommend this path, btw). I continued forward.
The descent of Smarts Mountain was clearer than the ascent. No rebar needed. Other than mud, this portion was a nice gentle grade downward. At the bottom, you cross a footbridge over a stream, a gravel road, and then immediately start the climb of Mt. Cube. The rocks don't show up until near the summit. There's a small summit which likely would have had great views had the cloud not been sitting on the mountaintops. The real summit is about .25 mile farther up. You know you're there because at each of these, you have to climb across large slabs of stone,   following the cairns across a sparsely blazed trailed.  The views would have been lovely. 
Mt Cube had a few more rocks to navigate around/over on the descent, but they let up about a mile down and I just had to contend with mud. 
The critters were smart and stayed in today. Not even any efts. The closest I came were several piles of moose poop near the top of Mt Cube.","Lyme-Dorchester Rd (1772.4)

Doesn't even rate a mention in AWOL
Got on where I got off yesterday on NH25A. The weather was marginally better: dreary until the final mile or so when the sun managed to break free of the clouds. It was also somewhat warmer. Yesterday's high never made it out of the 50's. Today might have hit low 70's, though it was still in the 60's when I finished. (Locals swear that this weather is NOT typical.) Because it never got warm yesterday, the trail did not dry much despite being rain free. Mud was plentiful. The underbrush was not nearly so wet today, so did not walk out of the woods today soaking wet like yesterday, so another bonus.
This section was blessedly easy, a nice hike to follow yesterday's slog. The muddy parts had to be skirted, but until the final mile off of Mt Mist, the rocks and roots were easily navigated around. The only climb of any note is the climb up and over Mt Mist. As you can tell from the sign, it's hardly notable. The hike down this small mountain was steepish in parts with a few boulders. I was able to jog along the trail on all but this final descent section.
I passed 4 day hikers all SOBO up Mt Mist. Above & Beyond informed me that tlc, Raccoon, et al. were 5 minutes ahead of me out of the woods, but I never saw them at all. I was out before noon, resting up for Mt Moosilauke.

The climb up is steep and rocky (would not want to do this in the rain, and not certain I would want to come down this side). The first challenge is just as you start, a stream crossing requiring trekking poles and careful foot placement. Do not want to start with wet feet. Interestingly enough, 25 feet later you cross a bridge across a stream you could step across.
Heather returned to town and she joined me on this hike that I confess I was nervous about. (ALL the White Mountain hikes make me nervous because they are all notoriously tough.) We climbed steadily, making full use of the wooden steps and rebar where attached.  We hiked up at a smokin' 1 mile and hour. 
I did see a natural water fountain: water coming out of a rock. You may not be able to get blood from a turnip, but on Moosilauke, you can get water from stone. 
Water from stone
Once we summited, we did get some beautiful views in all directions. 
Moosilauke Summit
 And there were lots of people--most of them young, I should note--who had climbed up to eat lunch. I will say the effort was worth it. 
To climb down, you follow a stony trail for about a mile, move through a narrow trail surrounded by scrub, and then descend down steep rocks on the southern side. This side is not as steep as the northern side, but there were several places where water ran straight down the trail, so you were hiking in a shallow stream bed as much as a trail.

Only at about a mile from the end do you finally come to nice dirt trail and easy grade. 
I owe the AT 1 more mile. We didn't finish until 3:00 and the margarita discussion on the downside convinced us to head directly to Hanover for more $3 cold refreshment. It was 8 hours of hiking. The final descent killed my ankles and knees. So I skipped the 1 mile from High St to NH 25. Weather is supposed to turn iffy on Sunday, so might be a good day for a short trail run.

This climb was brutal and took from 8 hours to complete (the miles are AT miles; we hiked an extra mile to get to trail head). We decided to do this section southbound. Both of us find climbing easier than descending. I'm not sure it would have made a huge difference except going the NOBO would have meant doing the hardest section at the end of the day, so I'm glad we went this direction.
The climb to Lonesome Lake Hut was, well, just a climb really. Other than having to ford Cascade Brook early, we encountered the run of the mill AT rocks, roots, and mud. We stopped at the hut for water and bathroom break, enjoying the lovely view across the Kinsman Pond. 

Mostly what you see during this initial section are your feet as you trudge up, up, up. There were a couple of exceptions:

Trail magic or bear leftovers?
Once you leave the hut, then the hike gets real. REAL hard. We stopped at the super buggy Kinsman Pond Shelter for lunch. The gnats made it quite clear that we were not welcome, so we moved on, finishing the climb to North Kinsman (4,293') mostly up steep rocky boulders and slabs (sorry, hands were full so didn't really take pics). We didn't use trekking poles along here at all, as hands, knees and butt were the most useful tools necessary to get up and over the two peaks.
We then went down and back up to the South Kinsman peak (4,358') where we were rewarded with 360 degree views.

S Kinsman Ridge
The descent off S Kinsman was glacial. It took us 1:42:00 to descend a single mile. We finally hit Eliza Brook and followed a rugged and eroded trail into the shelter area.

None of what I have been reading has sounded pleasurable, though I do admire the sheer endurance of these folks braving deep mud, dangerous stream crossings, and harsh terrain. 
Today was the first day of sunshine, so Above & Beyond and I decided to drive up Mt Washington (a nerve-wracking experience on its own). (We've been checking the webcam on the mountain regularly to make sure we can see something. The road is privately owned and pricey to drive.) By the time we arrived at noon, the view was a bit cloudy from the tip top. We hiked the 1.4 miles down to Lakes of Clouds Hut to reconnoiter the trail a bit and enable us to claim we had climbed Mt Washington, as we, of course, had to hike back up. 

Day hiking Mt Washington
View of the hut & one lake
We climbed down (and back up) large rocks, with views emerging as we came off the Mt Washington summit. There were lots of day hikers and a few thru hikers. (I note here that none of the thru hikers appeared particularly happy; most look pretty exhausted and wrung out.) The views were great. The rocks at times painful and reminiscent of the worst of Pennsylvania. Despite our fresh legs and light packs, it still took us an hour each way. There was running water on the trail still, so two dry days weatherwise and it's clear the trail is still soaked. Heavy rain is forecast to return on Sunday. At the end of this easy 3-mile day, we were both pretty tired, and my right foot was hurting. The stop at a brewery in Gorham on the way back to our camper was a nice end to the day.
For the time being, we've decided to forego AT hiking as such, though we've identified some day hikes up to some of the presidential peaks. I would like to walk Franconia Ridge, but it's not going anywhere. Fortunately for us, we don't really have much in the way of time constraints.

So....left New Hampshire on July 15. Had been waiting out some early summer New England storms when I woke up July 4 with a pinched nerve in my right hip. I had spent two weeks in the travel travel slowly relearning how to walk upright when we got a not entirely unexpected call that Above & Beyond's father was slipping away. Three days later we were suffering the triple digit heat oppressing southern Louisiana. Let's just say that riding on heated seats in 100°weather is NOT on my list of recommended ways to enjoy a summer road trip in the deep South.
We had been back only a few days having made our rounds catching up with friends, when I started feeling poorly and started monitoring my blood pressure, which felt ""off."" On the morning of my husband's birthday, I woke with a migraine and nausea. Checked my blood pressure and decided a visit to the ER would be in order. Would seem rocking blood pressure of 263/127 is NOT considered a good thing, so bought myself two nights in chez ICU getting my blood pressure down from orbital to simply high where I was flagged as a medical curiosity.

""I didn't because I don't have hypertension.""
""Are you mobile? Do you exercise?""

""Hmmmm.""
Several tests later. No stroke. No heart attack. Blood work indicating great health. 
""I have had some pretty bad pain in my hip since July 4.""
That factoid elicited a doctor's shrug then, ""Here's a couple of prescriptions. Follow up with your primary care doctor.""

July was done, and I must say it sucked.
August has been funeral planning, my husband spending hours on the telephone with insurance companies and lawyers, performing repairs and maintenance, and me trying to regain the physical strength to walk around the block.
After 4 weeks, we are finally ready to set out again. Costco has been visited. Chicken has been dehydrated. Hitch repaired. Next week we will return to Virginia where we started and where we had planned to be after a trip up Katahdin. Sigh. We will start hiking south through Shenandoah National Park. We bought a small motorcycle so we can leap frog sections, my husband deciding that he wants to hike with me.

The trail was easy. The climbs were gentle. The downhills even more so. And the views were lovely.
I wanted to wallow in the dirt so happy I was to see no boulders, cobblestones, or granite slabs. I was uncertain about the amount of strength loss in the two months off trail. By my guesstimate, I'm down about 25%, which was not as much as I feared.
We will slackpack again tomorrow and then we have to take Sunday off to move the trailer. (When I originally planned this trip, I reserved campground spots for the major holidays, but it was not always possible to get 10-14 days in the same spot.

Our second day back on trail once again started out in the comfortable mid-60's. After getting all the vehicles in place, we were hiking by 8:00 am. We were soon passed up by Bear Claw, a southbounder who was heading out from the Gravel Springs hut about the same time we passed. We got to chat with him at our lunch stop at the Elkwallow Wayside. He had started in Maine in July and wallowed his way through what he described as a ""brutal"" 100 mile wilderness with chest-deep stream crossing. I'm beginning to think this wasn't the best summer to hike New England.
Anywho...the terrain along this section is mostly packed dirt interspersed with crushed rocks. While there aren't the ankle-rolling stones of the northern trail, there are enough rocks buried in the trail to stub your toe on. I am already on track to lose two toenails, one each on left and right feet--the same two that had just grown back from the first half of this trip! My shoes are not too small. It just so happens that when I trip over a small stone, the same toe on each foot gets jammed. Go figure.) We crossed two mountains of note: Hogback and Pass. They both had some steepish sections to climb that required a few rest stops on our still-developing trail legs, but when I compare the total ascents from yesterday, today's was a full 1,100 feet less. 
After Elkwallow southbound, there is a long, flat ridge walk that is everything you would imagine a hike in a late summer forest should be. Some trees are starting to carpet the trail with their yellow leaves that float through the air on sun rays. The smell of flora warmed in the sun is sweet and fecund. The only sound is the crunch of your own feet on the trail, the buzz of insects, and your own heartbeat.
With the exception of the two deer in the photo, we saw no animals. There were a lot of hikers out today, mostly day hikers enjoying the national park on a holiday weekend. Above & Beyond and I finished the day tired and hot. The trail is bone dry (Virginia in this area is under water conservation orders according to one local we met.) The heat dome apparently tracked us down. Next week is supposed to be brutally hot--highs near 100, and water on trail is scarce, so we are assessing our hiking options. We had planned 5 days starting on Monday, but we will likely stick with slackpacking until Wednesday. We didn't check the streams off trail, but all the streams listed as water sources that cross the trail have been bone dry except one, meaning there have been 2 locations directly on trail to get water between Front Royal and Luray--one piped stream and Elkwallow.

ATC posted a trail closure in the SNP for a search and rescue. I believe they found the 75-year-old hiker. It was a section we will be hiking through on Wednesday. I did a bit of Googling and saw that there have been a number of SARs in SNP. I was surprised.
Because of the brutal heat that has settled in, we're slackpacking the next two days. Possible rain in the afternoon is forecast for Wednesday, so fingers crossed because it is very dry out here. Ironic to be wishing for a rainy AT.

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668669,"Today saw more rocks and uneven stones. The effect was a slower pace and increased foot soreness at the end of the day. Our hike started with temps in the mid-60's, so a pleasant morning climbing. There was a refreshing breeze throughout the morning, and we were able to knock out all the major elevation gain before lunch and before the heat set in, which it decidedly did by the time we finished at 3:30. We reached Skyland, the highest point in the park, for a late lunch (technically we didn't climb the side trail to said high point). We ate what we carried, opting to skip the extra distance to the resort dining area as well.Right off the bat we missed a turn and found ourselves looking over an incredible vista from Mary's Rock (our happy accident of the day). Fortunately it was only 0.1 mile off trail and early so well worth the minor effort.There were not many people on trail overall, only day hikers. We could tell we were nearing an outlook simply by the sudden appearance of people, many in *inappropriate* footwear, including one with no footwear at all. (Yes, I am being judgy here.) I thought Labor Day would be more crowded but not disappointed in having a quiet hike.As we were approaching Skyland, we looked up to see a young buck, sporting a single small antler, trotting toward us on the trail. Showing exceptionally good manners, he gave us the right of way as were climbing up. Critter count: 1 garter snake spied by Above & Beyond, 1 aforementioned deer.","Luray, VA (1250.9)

Willie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668699,"A couple of AT hikers came across a grisly sight today in Shenandoah National Park. Just outside Lewis Mtn Campground, they discovered the decapitated corpse of a woodland frog lying prone upon a dead log. Ranger Rick Rowle was called to the scene to investigate. 
Above & Beyond, when questioned, said, ""It was shocking. We were making such good time and then this. You just can't believe something like this can happen in such a serene place."" 
Willie shuddered but was speechless, muttering only, ""Ewwwww. Ewwwww."" 
The bees, however, were all abuzz with curiosity.
Ranger Rowle left the hikers with some sage advice and a warning: ""Never gonna make you cry. Never gonna say goodbye. Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you. Also, don't hike in toad gear.""
No other incidents have been reported at this time.
Otherwise, no heart-exploding climbs or ankle breaking descents, just hot, dry green tunnel. One section of rocky trail. Should have seen it coming when we passed the intersection to ""Bearfence rock scramble.""
We're taking a couple of days to do some touristy stuff while close to DC.
Critter Count: 1 chipmunk, too many deer to count (no doubt enjoying the post-holiday exodus of camper).","Spitler Knoll (1265.4)
