TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659712,Greetings This is my first attempt at posting on the famous Appalachian Trail Journal.  I will be learning my way around this site for the next few entries. I do plan to start my hike in March so perhaps by then I will have a clue as to what I’m doing. I hope you can follow along and enjoy the journey with me. Let’s go hiking!Scott,,View Entry,"Jan 02, Mon",0
TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659716,"My 2nd entry of the three before they publish or post them whatever is the correct way to say that. I attempted to add a picture to this entry.  We shall see if I was successful. One of the things they (Trail Journals) has you do is list all your gear what it ways how much it cost amongst other details. Now this has been an eye opening exercise for me.  First off deciding what of the many things that could be included, what to include. Next, finding some of the stuff presented it’s own challenge. Then comes weighing everything so you will know how heavy the pack will be. As you can see by my list and the 40 plus pounds of the gear listed, and that’s before food and water, that I have discovered another challenge to work through. In addition to the unexpected weight of my gear is the interesting problem of how is all of that stuff going to fit in and on my pack. Maybe there is a video for that. I’ll work on that soon.I have begun walking in my neck of the woods with my pack filled with weights and water bottles to get me used to carrying the pack. I regularly walk 4 miles and have worked up to 27 lbs in my pack. Considering the 40 plus pounds of gear listed, I’m going to need to add some more weight soon. Hopefully I can begin adding more miles also.So much to do and such little time. Well, such is life! I better quit writing and get busy.Until next timeScott",,View Entry,"Jan 03, Tue",0
TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659729,"This being my third attempt at posting to my Journal I think it will be very interesting to see what it looks like when it gets published/posted. As you might expect when one decides and announces to others their intentions to hike the Appalachian one often gets the “Why?”. That is a great question and one I often think about and I can have different answers at different times. So, I suppose that there are several reasons at least for me that I want to hike the trail. Some of them include; I get to spend time with good friends, I will get to see parts of the United States in a unique way, and I will get to be on a huge adventure. That isn’t an exhaustive list but it includes those that cross my mind often. Sometime in the near future I will tell you the story of how it came to be that I learned of the Appalachian Trail and learned that I wanted to attempt it.Another question I get is why are you writing a trail journal? 1st it will be a record of what I saw and did for me to read after I get back home. 2nd it will give a few folks the chance to follow along with my hike and in some way participate in it with me from afar.Disclaimer time. If sentence structure, the proper use of punctuation, correct spelling, and the use of the right form of the word are critical for you, you probably will find this journal frustrating. I only know one language, English, and don’t know it well. So, now you know or is it no?More to come!TheOkie",,View Entry,"Jan 04, Wed",0
TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659774,"Greetings from the pre trail side of life. The picture is of a beautiful sunset we saw while in Botswana.  The giraffe was kind enough to pose for us. 
I'm continuing walking around my neck of the woods and have increased my pack weight to 30 lbs. My next goal will be to increase my mileage. I've noticed a thing or two while walking in my neighborhood.  The most notable is that I get my pack on and cinched up good and as I get a mile to a mile and a half in I need to re-cinch my pack again.  The time or to that I've ridden horses I've noticed that they do that to the horses saddle. Not sure why but you can learn an old dog a new trick. 
Speaking of pack weight.  I've heard from a few people close to me suggesting that I rethink some of my gear to get my pack weight down. They seem to think that a 40 to 50 lb pack will be to much for me. I'll have to give that some consideration. I did see a guy on YouTube that said his pack weighed in at 45 lbs. He started Jan 1 of this year. If you have any suggestions let me know. Stay tuned for more!TheOkie",,View Entry,"Jan 07, Sat",0
TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659828,"My sweetheart!
Anyone that has thought about or announced that they are hiking the Appalachian Trail should have paused early on to count the cost. 
For me the the hardest part to count was the separation from my sweet wife.
Let me introduce you to her. One of her trail names is Gorgeous. I may spell it differently from time to time but Gorgeous it is. She has another one that I'll tell you about someday.   Gorgeous and I have been married for 41 years and soon it will be 42. And in those 41 years we have never been apart more than a couple of weeks at a time.  So as you might imagine we are finding the aspect of being apart challenging to say the least. We've made plans to help mitigate this but neither of us find this part pleasing. She will be a busy lady keeping the home fires burning,  caring for aging parents,  watching grandchildren among all the other things she will be doing. 
Gorgeous has chosen to be my biggest supporter, encourager, and  helper in my preparation for this journey. And, this journey would not have even been possible without it.. I love you Gorgeous and I'm going to miss your sweet spirit each moment of the day. Thank you for your love and support!",,View Entry,"Jan 12, Thu",0
TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659890,"Break from Training 
I've put on pause my extensive training,  if that's what one chooses to call it, for a week of fun.
The 1st picture is of my eldest grandson Coen and I enjoying the Chili Bowl.  I can hear you just now asking,  what pray tell is the ""Chili Bowl""? I'm so glad you asked. It is a week full of indoor sprint car racing in Tulsa, OK. Loud noise, dirt, fumes, expensive food, crazy fans, fast cars, and late late nights, now you can see why I think it's fun. 



The 2nd picture, if it actually makes it in, is of my Dad, me, my son, and grandson.  Four generations getting to enjoy the races! So much fun seeing the next generation enjoying the Chili Bowl. The 3rd picture, if it happens, is of the usual crew. First row is my son, and younger brother. Top row is my dad, me my nephew and older brother. This group has been doing this for a time.


So, as you can guess, I did nothing that helped prepare me for a hike of almost 2200 miles. Body did nothing but the mind seems to never be far from thoughts of the trail. 
I very muchly appreciate you following me. More to come.",,View Entry,"Jan 18, Wed",0
TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660004,"Terms and definitions are nice to have when reading. So, from time to time I will throw in a term and my understanding of its definition.  Hopefully this will help any of you that have not read many trail journals to understand what is ment by the term. As you may have surmised today's term is Trail Angel or as the case may allow Trail Angels or even Trail Magic.
The term Trail Angel, as defined  by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy is, a term of endearment given to people who have provided Trail Magic in the form of direct kindness and generosity to hikers. 
The picture is of one of the most famous, in my opinion,  ""AT"" Trail Angels, Fresh Grounds and his Leapfrog Cafe. He is one of the many that I hope to have the opportunity to meet. The picture came from an article in thetrek.com. you can find more about him there.
I think these Trail Angels are some of the most wonderful people on the earth. Micah 6 verse 8 says ""He has told you, O man what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God. ESV. These Trail Angels of all people understand and practice this. They provide direct kindness and generosity to complete strangers that in most cases they will never see or hear from again and expect nothing in return. I know, your thinking that is crazy amazing! And it is.
These amazing people will provide full meals, drinks, fruit, trash disposal, snacks, rides, and even lodging to name a few. I've read of a few times that they have loaned hikers their car! Again, incredibly kind and generous people! I look so forward to meeting these Trail Angels and maybe someday getting to be one myself. 
So, now when you read the term Trail Angel or Trail Magic you'll have some reference of what I'm referring to. Those wonderfully kind and generous people that are looking for a hiker or a few to be kind and generous to.",,View Entry,"Jan 30, Mon",0
TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660072,"We had a shot of cold air visiting our area for a few days this week.  That gave me a chance to see how my cold hiking gear would work.  Previous to today I've been regularly hiking in 35 to 45 degree temperatures and my set up for that was good. However,  we now had temps in the low 20's and sleet falling nicely.  Who in there right mind could pass up on a chance to go hiking in that? Some time in the future we'll have to discuss AT hikers and right minds.
The picture is of me getting ready to test my cold hiking gear. Pre umbrella incident. 
So, out I went planning to test four things, water proof socks, warm layers, gloves, and a umbrella. I got in a eight mile hike and the water proof socks were very comfortable.  Not much a test of water proofness but no hot spots or blisters.  The warm layers were great. I even think they would work in temps a few degrees lower.  There was a brisk breeze out of the north and I was able to regulate my body temp well. The gloves consisted of a mid weight set of finger gloves with water proof mitten shell over that. I was able to go with the shells only after about a mile and my hands kept nice and warm. What a great surprise. The umbrella was my only failure for the day. While trying to open the umbrella I managed to break it. A big case of operator error! Hopefully my learning curve is over and that won't happen again. 
Overall I count it as a successful outing.  I'm still looking for that rainy day to see how hiking, setting up my tent and packing up in the rain goes and what my learning curve is. Until then I'll keep on with my training.",,View Entry,"Feb 06, Mon",0
TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660122,"What do you get when you combine hiking with 24 hours of hard rain and flash flood warnings? If you survive,  a great learning experience.  
McDuck and I had planned some time ago a trip to the Eagle Rock loop trail in Arkansas. As the trip approached there began to be a chance of rain. By the time we actually arrived in Mena Arkansas the chances had improved. 
We arrive at the trail head in a very light rain and began our hike. We hiked off and on in light rain until about 3:15 pm, then it got pretty heavy.  We were good with that getting to test our rain gear and hands free umbrellas. It got time to set up camp and we got to practice setting up our Zpacks Tents in the rain. More success. 
Thats when McDuck informs me that we now have thunderstorms rolling in and possible flash flooding. Not to worry cause we're on the top of a nice mountain. Well it proceeds to rain and pour and thunderstorms all night and continued all day the next day. I began to wonder if we needed an ark on top of that mountain. 
After checking the condition of the once little stream at the bottom of the mountain we quickly learned that we were in fact experiencing a flash flood. So, we then made the executive decision to hunker down in our dry tents and wait it out. 

The rain stopped about 8:30 pm woo hoo! Sometime around 6:30 am McDuck's crow alarm clock went off waking us up to a foggy but non rainy morning.  The packing up soon began and by 8:45 am we were tentatively on our way. At the bottom of the mountain we were more than pleased to see that the raging river of yesterday was now a rolling creek that was passable. We put on our respective water shoes and crossed our 1st of many water crossing of the day.
Soon the sun was out and we continued our way back down the trail wading, rock hopping,  sloshing thru, and slipping into the water crossings until we had made it back the 11.3 miles to the vehicle.  We were sure to thank our God for a safe return.  McDuck took me over to see the pretty falls at the trail head before we hopped in and headed back towards home.
After a flat on the way home a stop for food and lots of good discussion of what we had learned we made it home. So thankful McDuck gentley pushed me to go on this hike. I learned a great deal and have a good amount of confidence for the upcoming AT hike. Until then.",,View Entry,"Feb 11, Sat",0
TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660133,"As I ponder the many facets of our pre hiking trip to Eagle Rock loop in Arkansas, I've settled on what can be considered as the good, the bad and the ugly takeaways or lessons learned. 
The good would include things like my La Sportiva shoes, darn tough socks, and my water proof socks.  There were no hot spots or blisters, and even after hiking in the rain most of the 11 miles my feet were dry at the end of the day. Also in the very wet and muddy conditions hiking out I felt like there was good traction even on rock slab. The hands free umbrella functioned well. Our Zpacks Duplex tents kept us dry thru more than 24 hours of serious rain even as water ran under and at times pooled under our tents. My Therm-a-rest Neoair Xlite performed flawlessly. The Zpacks 10 degree full zip sleeping bag kept me toasty warm although the low of 35 degrees wasn't much of a test. Several other peices of clothing and equipment also worked well including my HMG 3400 Junction backpack.  I also include my overall body in the good. Please don't mistake that statement as my body is good. Feet, knees,  back and shoulders seemed to do well and hold up more gooder than I expected. The last thing I will mention in the good category is McDuck's and my communication and decision making. It seemed we came to similar conclusions from the information we obtained and as we discussed options we both had input and consider the others point of view.
 
Now on to the bad. 1st on the list is the InReach Mini 2. Not that there's anything wrong with the Mini 2 the bad was just my ability to use it. I thought I understood the basics but from the start it was a struggle.  I did finally communicate thru and with it. A close 2nd was the Farout and Relive app. Again there is nothing wrong with the apps. It was my inability and even my failure to use the apps. So the bad ends up being user interface issues or in other words I'm not so techno savvy. 
The ugly was me when it came to climbing the mountains. My training had been regular and somewhat strenuous,  but not even close enough for the steep climbs we experienced. At the end of the 1st day it was all I could do to set up my tent and lay down. I plan to continue with my training but we just don't have any mountains in our neck of the woods. The mountain training will just have to wait till game day.
All in all a great experience full of learning opportunities and successes.

TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660217,"The picture is of one of the Apollo launches I watched many years ago with a great deal of excitement and a bit of trepidation. I remember the man in the control room counting down the blast off with T minus 1 minute and counting.  Well, we are T minus 1 week for the launch of our Appalachian Trail hike and counting, and I am filled with a great deal of excitement and a bit of trepidation. 
Very soon we will start the 870 mile 13 hour journey to Amacalola Falls and launch our 2194.3 mile treck from Amacalola to Katadyn Main. Soon the gathering of gear will become the using of that gear. Soon all of the iconic sights and places will be sights and places we have visited.  Soon all the planning will become our new reality.  Soon!
One very interesting fact noted when putting this entry together is that on trail at about 870 miles we will be near Waynesboro Virginia and it will have taken us about 90 days to get that far. Whew! That sounds like a long way and it's still not half way.
So, until then I plan to continue my training walks and try my best to not unpack and repack my backpack over and over. I  can't seem to help myself,  I mean what if I forgot to put in that one thing I didn't want to forget to put in. I know, I know, I must stop the insanity.

TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660270,"For those planning an AT thru hike there are a few terms that we need to be acquainted with. The picture is of a white blaze. These white blazes mark the trail from Springer Mountain near Amacalola Falls Georgia all the way up Mount Katadyn in Main. I'm told there are about 165,000 of these white blazes which works out to about 1 every 70 yards. That's a bunch of 2 inch by 6 inch white blazes. 
Another one of the terms we needed to learn is a Zero. In trail vernacular a Zero means no miles hiked on the trail. Any day that we are in town or just don't hike on the trail is called a zero. We may still walk a few miles in town on zero days but those miles don't count in our trail miles.
Closely kin to the zero is the Nero day. It is any day that we don't walk many miles.  It usually refers to a day that we walk a few miles into a town to resupply. So, just how many miles constitute a few? I'm glad you asked, however,  that appears to be a number in the eye of the hiker, not specifically defined. 
The last term for us to learn in this post is Hiker Box. This is a very small box a hiker can get into and sleep when the weather is bad. NOT! A Hiker Box is really a container in town or at a Hostel,  into which hikers can place unwanted or unneeded food, clothing, or other items. Other hikers are free to take any of these items. One never knows what will be found in a hiker box. I'm hopeful that I will find treasures like Spam packets or even Sardines in some of those hiker boxes.
There are several more terms to be defined and I will try to be mindful of them as they are dropped into this journal and provide you with a definition.

TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660334,"We left the Phantom Buffalo Ranch about 5 am Monday morning and after two stops, one in Memphis Tennessee and one in Ellijay Georgia for fuel for both the vehicle and its passengers we arrived around 7 pm at the Amacalola Lodge.  You know, it seemed to take longer when we were actually doing it. Jeff, our third hiker met us in the lobby along with his sister Linda and they helped us get our packs and other luggage in. After a brief planning session we all scattered to our respective rooms. 
The next morning we gathered in the Lodge restaurant for breakfast at 8am before our adventures for today. After breakfast we made our way down the mountain to the Visitor Center for our intro to AT talk, get our packs weighed,  and get our official hiker number and tag. I am hiker number 589 and my pack weighed in at 33.5 lbs. We then took our pictures at the famous arch at the beginning of the approach trail.  The pictures are of the three of us Jeff, me, and McDuck and one of Gorgeous and me.  Next it was 600 plus stair steps to the top of the falls.  Wow! That was tough. All of the ladies made it up that far. Wow! Are they tough. 
Then Jeff, Jeff's sister Linda, McDuck and myself pushed on the 7 plus miles to Springer Mountain. Early in the day were 3 tough uphills that we had learned at our AT talk this morning were as tough as anything we would see in Georgia.  I hope he was right! I was sucking air and struggling to get to the top of them. We stopped a couple of times to let me rest and then once at Black Gap shelter. 
Soon we were on top of Springer Mountain which is the southern terminus of the AT. In other words its our starting point, woo hoo!
We took the mandatory pictures and signed the register being careful to not wax poetic. I will try and include pictures of this in my next post. Angela and Gorgeous met us there and brought us all back to the lodge after a brief stop at an apple stand store. And here I thought Georgia was known for her peaches?
Some of us cleaned up for dinner and others didn't but we got to eat the buffet at the lodge. We watched the sunset and then Gorgeous and I set by the fire for a while before retiring to our room.
Tomorrow we are planning a shorter day. Our goal is 7 plus miles to Hawk Mountain shelter. We will meet for breakfast at 8 am and soon after that will be the tearful farewell to my sweetheart so that they can start their long journey home and we can start our long journey north.

TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660354,"Our 1st full day on trail is considered a success! With our shuttle driver Linda we successfully made the trip from the lodge to Springer parking lot. Although there was one of us who was so nervous about the narrow road that it required two stops. About 10 we began the days journey.  The trail was great for most of the day, lots of flat areas and when there was uphill it was a nice grade. I was able to breath fairly well. I hiked 18,110 steps and the temps were in the 60's and low 70's. A beautiful day!
 
We made it to Three Forks road crossing and were greatly surprised and grateful to see and participate in our 1st trail magic.  Woo Hoo! Dale Johnson who through hiked last year was feeding hikers donuts.  Yum Yum! You better believe I participated. When we were leaving him I told him that we would always remember him because he was our 1st.
 
On we went with our sights set on Hawk Mountain shelter. As we journeyed we saw 3 Army Rangers come down the trail about a mile apart. One carrying a blue gun, one a sledgehammer and one with a backpack. Around 1:30 we rolled into the shelter and decided to take a spot in the shelter due to the predicted rain tonight. We are sharing the shelter with Pink, Happy, Cus Mustard , Freijy and another unidentified person so far. I got about my chores to get set up, get water, find the privy, and eat.We tried, really tried to eat all of our food for today, but, I failed.
About 4pm several more made it in and the shelter began to get crowded. Lots of activity with getting sleeping pads and bags and food out. I suspect it will be an interesting night. The group at the picnic table are enjoying some type of smoke, while we are enjoying relaxing in the shelter. The shelter is rated for 12 and we currently have 10 spots taken. 
About 5:30 I decided it was time to try to eat more of the food designated for today.  I made a dent but the hiker hunger hasn't hit yet. 
The people were very friendly and I enjoyed visiting and listening to the stories. There were interesting smells also.. Finally it was hiker midnight and we all almost as one mind started for our sleeping bags. First one to sleep gets the good nights rest.

Before I get too far on this entry I want to go back to yesterday's journal and the things I forgot. There were several 1st. 1st full day on trail,  1st trail magic,  1st Sobo ""South Bounder"" trail named the Mayor,  1st shelter stay,  and 1st privy used. Now that was quite a day. 
On to today.  Up early as I mentioned around 5:45 am but didn't really get out of the bag until 6:45. Did the morning chores of packing up, eating, privy and lots of visiting before setting off on today's journey.  
We took off and enjoyed being above the clouds in the valley.  It had quit raining for a bit and the trail was fairly agreeable until Horse Gap. Horse Gap is at about 2660 ft and in one mile we climbed to over 3660 ft and that my friends was tough for this guy. Not many views today but we did enjoy what we had. Yea for us smelling a rose or two along the way.  One interesting thing I picked up on today as it rained lightly is that I have a lovely rain suit and a umbrella,  yet for most of the day I didn't deploy them. Finally the rain got heavy enough that out came the umbrella and I was proud to have it.
Shortly before Gooch shelter we met Lilly and Sarah.  Lilly is a Ridge Runner in the Gooch area and Sarah works for ATC. Both ladies were super friendly. Lilly informed us that she would be staying at our shelter tonight.  I couldn't help but wonder if that would change the shelter activities for tonight. We rolled into Gooch Gap Shelter around 11:15 am and got us spots in the shelter again.  Two nights on trail two nights in shelters. I didn't see that happening. 
We're here at Gooch with several of our new friends again so looking forward to tonight's activities. We've already discussed thumb bootie dancing, whatever that is. We've also been promised another lazer light show with commentary.  Can't wait. Another unique thing I forgot to mention yesterday is tribal illumanesces, any guesses on what that is? Give up! Rubbing a granite rock against another making sparks. You wouldn't believe how much intertainment we got from that last night. 🤣
More rain predicted for tonight with a few strong storms and cooler.  We have another 8 or so mile hike planned to Lance creek for tomorrow that will get us close to Blood Mountain.  It's supposed to be a tough one but that's for another day.

His alarm sounds like a really bad cough. Yet again I managed to stay in my toasty warm sleeping bag until about 7am. Got busy with my chores, you know,  packing up, eating,  privy,  and visiting.  As each hiker left we checked where they were heading and wished them well.  It seemed that most were either getting off trail at Woody Gap for a Hostel stay or going bigger miles on into Neels Gap. We chose the more intelligent choice of 8 miles and tent camp, which is our 1st tent camp of the hike. Go figure. 
Before we got away we learned from Ridgerunner Lilly that what we experienced as shelter behavior from some of our new friends wasn't appropriate.  We just stood there in shock that what they were doing wasn't appropriate.  Whatever it was I  will remember it for a long time and still find myself laughing at their antics. 
Our hike began about 8 am in a lite rain lots of fog and soggy trail conditions. We managed about 1 hour hiking before the the real rain settled in and we deployed the umbrellas.  It rained off and on the rest of the day. We got our 2nd trail magic at Woody Gap while I was visiting with Gorgeous on Whatsapp. Then the climb started and we went up and up till I ran out of breath again.  
We have continued the tradition that HikingDancer started calling out River Crossing every time we cross a stream of any size. And with today's trail conditions we started our own tradition of calling out Pond Crossing every time the trail was flooded,  which was a lot today. 
We rolled into our home for the night about noon. Met our 2nd Ridgerunner Moxie and enjoyed our visit with her and the good information she shared with us.  We got our tents set up between rain showers gathered water and then back to the tents to get out of the rain bum bum bum. I ate a little lunch and unpacked my pack and started journaling. As I set in my tent it is coming down in buckets, but so far I'm dry. 
We'll try and weather the storms again tonight and plan to head to Neels Gap tomorrow about 7.5 miles ahead over the dreaded Blood Mountain. 🥴🧐 Not sure if we will take a Zero or a Nero there

We had set up our tents and Moxie commented how adorable our matching tents were. Did that ever make us feel manly. We were watching the weather forecast which was issuing severe thunderstorm warnings and tornado watches for our area. So we hunkered down in our tents to wait it out. When it hit it hit with a furry, heavy rain and lots of wind. Thankfully it was over in about 20 minutes no damage done. We agreed that our prayers were answered and God smiled upon us.
I slept great last night, only got up once and was warm and dry as we woke up to 40° sunny morning. A delicious breakfast of pop tarts and granola bars had me set and ready to go. We got packed up and on the wet soggy trail by 8:15 am. The hike out was pretty strenuous but we began to have some views and that makes hiking better. On our way we met a couple of former thru hikers Whisper and Bad Camel.  It was nice getting to visit with those ladies.  Both of them were very friendly and positive. We kept trying to guess which Mountain was Blood Mountain because it was the big one for today at around 4400 ft. The climb didn't disappoint.  When we reached the top we were greeted buy the iconic rock shelter and absolutely fantastic views.  We could even see the skyline of Atlanta. 
Ridgerunner Moxie found us up there and we enjoyed her knowledge and company.  We soaked up the sun and views,  made a few video calls, and took a few pictures then we headed off for Neel Gap. 
The climb down was steep, full of slab rock, wet and muddy.  There were also more views. 
We rolled into Neel Gap around 1 pm and were greeted by the shoe tree. Thats where those that have decided this hike is not for them discard their shoes. We are told about 25% of those that start quit here. We checked into our cozy cabin and began drying out and airing out our stuff. We made the short walk from our cabin to the store for laundry, resupply, and pizza.  While at the store we ran into our new old friends Pink Draggin' and Freajy.  By 6 pm we had accomplished each task and headed back to the cabin.  After organizing stuff and more importantly a nice shower it was hiker midnight. 
Tomorrow we have planned for about a 11 mile hike to Low Gap Shelter.   Several good climbs are in store.  Fun, fun. I think it is supposed to be beautiful!

You see today is Sunday,  the Lord's Day. So if you know the words sing along. This is the day, this is the day that the Lord has made. That the Lord has made. I will rejoice,  I will rejoice and be glad in it. And we were glad in it! I can hear you still singing sounds great! Yes I was glad and several other emotions during it.
We left Neels Gap on a 40° cool beautiful morning and I was elated at the beauty we were surrounded by. Soon after our start who did we run into again but Ridgerunner Moxie and two young sister we had sheltered with before from Ohio. Their trail names are OH and IO. Shortly after that I was exhausted at the climb we were on. By the time we reached the top my freshly washed body and clothes we sweaty again. Next we spent a good amount of time on a ridge amazed at the great views on both sides of us. This song kept running through my head, sing along if you like.  Oh beautiful for spacious skies for amber waves of grain. For purple mountain majesties above the fruited plain! America America God shed His grace on thee. And there I was looking left or right enjoying the purple mountain majesties! Awesome! 
 
Then we found ourselves at Tesnatee Gap looking up up up at our next climb over Wildcat mountain.  After a brief visit with the trail maintenance crew making the trail better we started up. There were many many switchbacks and I was breathing like a freight train and soaked with sweat by the time we reached the top. Exhausted! With Jeff in the lead we continued and as we got closer to Pig Pen Gap ( no I didn't make that up) we saw a water cache.  Thats where some kind person or persons leave us thru hikers water that we don't have to filter. Hear my heart go pitter patter for their kindness.  We cross the motocross road and spy someone setting up a canopy.  We asked,  could this be trail magic? We were anxious and hopeful that it was, and when we got closer they asked if we needed some food. Hear my heart go double pitter patter! We helped them set up and the four of the sweetest people you could hope to meet served us a smorgasbord of delicious food. Bob and Mitzi  Bary and Michelle not only fed us they loved on us and prayed for us. We stayed 1 1/2 hours and because of their kindness I was near tears when it was time to go. So so sweet! And they do this for several weekends every year. They get to bless a whole bunch of hikers. Amazing!
From there we had about five miles to our camp for the night and a good portion of that was on a fairly flat path, however,  it was about 1 1/2 feet wide and a 25 to 30 foot drop on our right side. Needless to say it was a little frightening for me. We rolled into camp around 2 pm and chose to tent rather than stay in the shelter.  Too much mice evidence. 
Today we covered 11.5 trail miles 30,449 steps and are now at mile 42.8. We have planned a 8 mile hike to Blue Mountain Shelter for  tomorrow. Todays temps started at 40° with a high of 63°

TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660469,"Before I get to the days journey please indulge me one moment while I talk to my Mom.
Mom, I know how you always stressed that we boys continue to learn new things.  So I know you will be proud of the new things I've already learned while on trail.  Things like,  Tribal illumanesces, which I've described as best as I can in a previous entry.  Thumbooty dancing, which is as I understand it a very localized type of dance that I wouldn't quite put in the same category as ballroom dancing but it seems it serves as a form of greeting to a Sobo hiker ( South Bound hiker). And the last term thus far is Fromunda Cheese.  Now as I understand it this is Cheese made from down under during warm damp conditions.  I'm still trying to get a better definition,  but so far that's all I've got. So, there you go Mom,  I'm still learning! Always striving to make Mom proud. 
On to today's events. I got up about 7 am after being amazed at McDuck's new found ability to snore only to find out it wasn't McDuck but a new guy to camp. Two things about the new guy. 1st he should see a doctor about his snoring.  It sounds like a bad case of sleep apena. 2nd he had a cute, friendly puppy named Atlas, and thats all I'm going to say about that. 
We started our days hike around 8 am needing to cover 7.3 miles to Blue Mountain Shelter.  McDuck had the lead as we rotate that each day. The terrain followed and old road bed and was really very nice walking. There were lots of places to see the other mountains as we hiked and as usual the sights are spectacular.  At one point I thought that McDuck's wife must be at our next shelter because he was flying up the trail. We got around 1 1/2 miles from our home for the night when our nice trail turned in to a very rocky trail.  Big bolders, big rocks, little rocks, rocks slanted in every direction.  It was quite fun trying to pick your path.  It was also quite exhausting on the feet and legs. One final push up hill and we were there. The shelter has a great view of the valley and next mountain. Beautiful! 
Of course once you get to the shelter its time for chores.  We chose to tent again tonight so investigating the possible tent spots begins and once selected the tent goes up. Then you get your pack unpacked and somewhat organized in your tent. Next you get the water you want from a nearby stream which today was about .1 mile down the mountain.  That chore done we got our food bags out and enjoyed our gourmet lunch. Mine was peanut butter and jelly on a tortilla, one small Snicker, a package of cheese crackers and a little beef jerky. Yum yum! With our early arrival in camp, chores done, lunch eaten it was time for a nap. Now that was nice! Dinner tonight was two, count them, two single serve packs of Spam, one cold soaked package of Creamy Chicken Raman and a sleeve of Lance Peanut Butter crackers.  Now thats eating high on the proverbial hog.
Lots of new faces this evening and some are  loud. Could be another interesting evening.  We reached a couple of mile stones today,  1st is that we've completed 2% of the trail.  Can I get a big woo hoo! 2nd is we crossed the 50 mile point, can I get another big woo hoo! 
So, 7.3 miles 18,376 steps, low this morning was 45° high was 75°. Another beautiful blue sky kind of day. Hopefully there will be another one tomorrow.

TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660488,"We started this morning with a beautiful sun rise. It was a great way to start a day remembering that God created the heavens and the earth.  
By 8 am we were on our way.  Tents packed,  backpacks loaded, pop tarts and cliff bar eaten and 1 litter of water consumed. Our day started with a mild climb and then 1000 ft decent into Unicoi Gap where we found Smoky Bear waiting on us with, you guessed it, trail magic! Cool Beans.  I enjoyed a Pepsi, a banana, a halo, and a honey bun. Smoky also is a shuttle driver for hire in this area and was good to visit with.  Next it was time to tackle Rocky Mountain.  1000 ft up in 1 mile. We met Susie, the trail maintainer, shortly after our start and had a informative visit with her along with a nice break from the climb. The trail maintainers in Georgia have done a great job keeping the trail in shape. We made it to the top of Rocky Mountain and I only went full locomotive on my breathing a couple of times.  When you're the lead dog you get to set the pace, so today we went nice and slow. 
From there it was 1000 ft down into Indian Grave Gap where we visited with a nice gentleman picking up his son. Then it was back to climbing. We climb up about 500 ft to Tray Mountain Road and met Jim and Grumpy doing trai magic for a place in Tennessee called Boots off Hostel.  Oh my, I had two chili hot dogs,  one cheese burger, a package of peanuts, two small snickers, a honey bun, a Gatorade and a coke. My my was that ever tasty. After eating and enjoying the chair and fire for a time, we literally had to force McDuck into finishing the day. He wanted to stay for dinner and breakfast in the morning. We completed the climb to the top of Tray Mountain which topped out at 4398 ft. Then we came down just a couple hundred feet to Tray Mountain shelter where we are tent camping right next to a rock ledge with a spectacular view.  We are anticipating another spectacular sun rise in the morning. 
Time to eat dinner and get ready for hiker midnight (dark).
We hiked 8 miles today 22,056 steps with the low 50° and the high 75°. Tomorrow we plan to hike 7.5 miles to Deep Gap Shelter.

TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660571,"Another beautiful sunrise this morning.  I don't know how many of those we'll get to see but they're beautiful! 
We got our packing up chores done,  breakfast eaten and started up the trail around 8 am. Jeff was lead today and the trail was kind early on. When we got to Addis Gap and it was time to climb. Kelly Knob stood in our path at about 4200 ft and proceeded to get me full on locomotive breathing twice.  Whew!  We then pretty much coasted down into where we will spend the night at Deep Gap Shelter. 
We arrived about noon set up tents and then stopped to visit with Harry from New Zealand.  He had passed us early in the day hiking in sandels.  A very nice young man and enjoyed visiting with him. We then ate lunch which consisted for me of a peanut butter wrap, two small Snickers,  and beef jerky.  So good. 

 
After lunch it was water gathering time so we hiked back down trail a bit to the pipe and collected and filtered water. Then we watched as McDuck planned out our next section of the hike. His great planning helps us in our resupply efforts as we plan to head into Hiawassee in the morning. As the afternoon moved along Plunger and Avery made it along with Ironcoss and his dog May, MB Militant Buddhist,  Andy and Melanie other wise known as the couple from Maine and several others that chose to remain unnamed. 
So, today we hiked from. Tray Mountain Shelter to Deep Gap Shelter 7.5 miles or  19,758 steps. Temps ranged from 42 to 75 before it cooled on down to 50° Tomorrow is from Deep Gap Shelter to Deep Gap road crossing 3.5 miles to catch a free shuttle into Hiawassee for a Nero and a Zero.  That means if plans hold together two nights in a hotel.  Woo! Hoo! Lots of opportunities for town chores.

TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660627,"Another 1st for us on day 10, a Zero.  A zero is a day with no trail miles hiked and most always is a town day. So, you ask, what does a hiker do on a zero day?  That is a fabulous question and I'm glad you asked.  I can't speak for all hikers but for me it involves lots of eating, resting, laundry, showering, more eating, doing my resupply, packing my pack, unpacking my pack, rethinking my food bag, eating and more resting. 
The picture is of a two lip tree at the hotel we're staying at. We chilled out in the room for most of the morning cleaning and organizing our gear then reorganizing it again.  Then a short walk back to a couple of stores for items we either forgot yesterday or decided we needed last night. We learned that hiker boxes are much like people,  it's not what they look like on the outside that counts, but whats on the inside that matters. After that it was back to the room for the rest of the pizza from last night.  Then when the belly is full and the body gets warm a nap happens.  Oh so sweet. 
For dinner tonight our selection was Daniel's Steak House.  Jeff and I chose the buffet and McDuck had a steak. After dinner I was able to visit by phone with my Mom and Dad and catch up on their comings and goings.  Got to visit with Gorgeous and Miss Betty, and then my daughter called and brought me up to date on Lucy and Rosco and all of their adventures. 
Back to the room for my final shower for a day or two and then off to sleep it will be.
Tomorrow we have a shuttle coming for us at 8 am and we think we will be on trail by 8:30. Planning on around a 12 mile day tomorrow ending at Muskrat Creek Shelter.

TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660602,"We were up about 6:30 packing up while enjoying another sunrise so that we could hike about 3.5 miles to catch the free, yes I said free, shuttle into Hiawassee for the next two nights. As I was finishing my packing up near the shelter, May the collie dog came over to make sure I remembered my training from last night. Sure enough I remembered just how she liked to be scratched.  I'm guessing that there was or were, which ever you prefer, 25 or so of us at this shelter so it was a happening place this morning.  
With McDuck in the lead we were on our way around 7:40 am with an invigorating uphill hike. I got very close to full locomotive a couple of times and by the end of the 1st climb it was time to shed the jacket. We experienced another couple of 1st today.  We saw a sign for a side trail that said Vista,  so we went and admired the view. The next one was riding the free shuttle.  Not as nice as Linda's shuttle service getting us on trail day one, but very comfy.  
While waiting for the shuttle who do you suppose we saw but Ridgerunner Lilly.  Again such a friendly knowledgeable young lady. Riding the bus going to town was McDuck, Jeff, MB, Yak, Rob, Christof, me and an unnamed young lady.  The ride in was about 15 minutes and they dropped us off at Ingalls grocery store and it was a short 2 or 3 blocks to the Holiday Inn.  Rooms weren't ready as it was 10:45 in the morning so we chilled out in the lobby. Around noon we headed over to the outfitters to pick up a thing or two, then to Tilted Cafe or Diner for lunch. We each got the two patty smash burger so named because you had to smash it to get it in your mouth. It was fabulous! However,  one of us couldn't eat all of theirs and it ""wasn't meeee"".
Next was a quick stop at the post office and then to Ingels for resupply.  It is obvious that I'm new at this based on the weight of the bags I came out of the store with. We made it back to the hotel and met another hiker Crossroad. She is also staying at the Holiday Inn.  We got checked in and soon got that much needed shower.  Oh so nice! Next it was laundry time and we found there to be a line,  so like good hikers we got in it. Laundry finished we chilled out and I worked on sewing on my pants. They started coming apart up at the top where belt loops are. Never fear, my mom taught me how to use needle and thread. Then it was time to eat. Jeff ordered us each a pizza and we ate real good. It is way past hiker midnight so lights out is soon upon us.
Tomorrow is a zero day and supposed to rain most of the day. I suspect there will be lots of resting and eating done when we're not messing with our packs. It was 3.5 miles today to Dicks Creek Gap were we plan to begin on Saturday morning.  The plan also includes a kick up in miles each day.
14,357 steps today, low was 40° and I failed to notice the high.

TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660658,"Up around 6:30 am the sky was blue it was about 65° and thats when I realized that I was still in the hotel. Oh well.  We soon were dressed and in the lobby for breakfast.  Biscuit and gravy, cheese omelet, sweet roll, and oatmeal down and I was ready for our shuttle.  
Ru, our shuttle driver, was right on time and the 3 of us shared the trip back to Dicks Creek Gap with Impatient and Granny Gear. As we got close to the Gap we could see trail magic. Woo Hoo! They weren't quite ready for us so I had some OJ and a honey bun then off we went.  
The day promised lots of climbs and it didn't disappoint. This was my toughest day of hiking as the up hills were relentless.  I was in full locomotive breathing on multiple occasions and it was my day to lead. The trail wanted to remind me that I'm not a real hiker just yet. We did have several green tunnels where the Mountain Laurel made really nice tunnels to walk through.  Very pretty. We also had some great views of the lake at Hiawassee. 
There were a couple of firsts for the day. Our 1st paid shuttle and we finished our first state. Cool beans! Woo Hoo! We forgot to stop and do the Thumbooty dance. Another oh well. Georgia was great! Good trail maintenance,  great people and a good start on making me a thru hiker.  However,  Georgia didn't let us off easy today.  Her last several miles were difficult.  North Carolina not to be outdone by Georgia just kept on giving us steep trails. Needless to say at the end of our day I was beat.
We found Muskrat Creek Shelter and commandeered spots in the shelter so we would not have to pack up in the cold rain. It wasn't long after that when Impatient and Granny Gear showed up and the shelter was full. We ate our lunch around 2 pm and began looking for warm clothes as the temperature dropped into the mid 40's and it was cold. We met several new folks, Bambi, Good, Danny Boy, Just Do It and Turtle Trax.
So we started today at Dicks Creek Gap mile 69.2 around 8:30 am temperature of 36° and finished at Muskrat Creek Shelter mile 81 with temperatures in the mid forties for a tough 11.8 mile day. Tomorrow we have planned a 12.5 mile day to Carter Gap Shelter. Another big day with lots of rain forcasted.

TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660674,"Today's best description is a tale of two days.  Yesterday a beautiful day and a very tough trail. Today a cold, foggy, rainy day and a pretty nice trail. 
Getting up this morning was a challenge.  The sleeping bags were warm and it was 33° and raining outside.  So we took our time and finally started getting around about 9 am. While packing up I noticed that a mouse had chewed holes in my Nylafume bag that helps water proof my stuff.  Grrrrrrr! After packing up and eating a quick bite we were off in our rain suits and gloves. It didn't take long for us to need to stop and take off a layer as we had warned up. It rained off and on while hiking but never got very heavy.  It had rained cats and dogs and any other small animal you choose to include last night so the trail was muddy, squishy and flowing with water or standing in water. We each had put on our water proof socks and were happy with that choice. 
We had a big climb up over 5000 feet today on Standing Indian Mountain, but as I have stated even that climb wasn't very bad. We rolled into Carter Gap Shelter about 3:30 pm quickly discovered the shelter was full and set up our tents gathered and filtered water ate our lunch and dinner,  brushed our toothies, hung our food bags  and went to bed by 7:30 pm
There have been a couple of first that I forgot to mention.  One was last night which was our 1st bear bag hanging.  Thats where we hang our food bags with all food, trash, toothpaste and anything else that a bear might think swelled good to eat. And 2nd was our 1st 5000 + ft mountain to climb. Yea! For more 1st.
So for today 12.5 miles to Carter Gap Shelter and we are at mile 93.5 and we took 29,251 steps. 33° low 45° high. Tomorrow the plan is 12.1 miles to Rock Gap Shelter. 
So, for my special reader Emmie, that's all for tonight, time to go night night. Sweet dreams!

TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660706,"Woo! Did I say Woo! Thats because our morning started at 28 cool degrees with a stiff north breeze.  Fingers began to be useless and toes were numb as we packed up frosty gear and I ate my cold soaked oatmeal.  Oh so good! 
We got away from camp about 10am and as usual it wasn't long before we desired to shed a layer. The trail was kind again this morning with fairly gentle ups and downs.  Once again we would have made the HikingDancer proud as we shouted River Crossing at each and every little trickle or full on creek crossing we came to. We enjoyed some beautiful panoramic views today even pryor to Albert Mountain. At one point we walked along a cliff edge with a couple hundred foot drop down a shear rock face. That puckered me up real good . We met a group of young adult hikers in that stretch, which was a nice distraction from the cliff and wet trail.
At one point McDuck stopped and said there it is! Your asking there what is? We didn't have to ask because we had been searching the mountain tops all morning.  However, before we discover what it is, let me tell you that the trail turned against us. All of the sudden with little warning we are hiking serious uphill.  Big log and rock steps up very steep inclines. Scaling up rock face at steep angles. I was in full locomotive breathing might near from start to the top. I can hear you saying just tell us what it is! It is Albert Mountain Fire Tower,  the official unofficial 100 mile mark on the trail. Can you believe it, we have walked 100 miles already. Now that calls for a celebration.  Some music please,  and join me in the Thumbooty dance! Ooooo, ahhhhh you are such good dancers. 
 
Once I had climb up as far as they allowed and admired the panoramic view we were back on trail headed north.  Once again the trail treated us kindly and by 4pm we were at Rock Gap and our shuttle driver Sherpa was waiting for us. He not only brought us to the hotel for the night but also educated us on the finer things in Franklin.  
We checked in did some unpacking,  walked over to KFC for dinner and then back to the room for more planning. Our current plan is to walk 9.5 miles to Wyah Gap get Sherpa to bring us back to Franklin. This allows us to avoid the high winds and frosty nights. 
Today was 12.3 miles from Carter Gap Shelter to Rock Gap starting at 28° ending at 38° which was 29,102 steps. Glad to be in out of the cold for tonight.

TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660755,"We woke up in the warm hotel instead of out in the 21° temps with windchill attached.  That along with the warm hotel breakfast instead of cold soaked oatmeal adds up to another good decision on our collective parts. 
Sherpa Al picked us up just before 10am and we were on trail with a brisk 28° around 10:30. The initial climb out of Rock Gap wasn't so bad but it didn't take long for us to warm up and shed a layer. The trail was mostly kind to us today. There were several places where we walked next to a stream which is one of my favorites.  We had more of the trail on the side of the mountain with a very steep drop off to one side or the other which is not one of my favorites. The trail was frozen much of the day which caused a very unusual and pretty sight, Needle Ice.  If my talents are with me tonight there will be a picture of Needle Ice right about now.
It was so pretty in the sunshine and I am told it sort of grows out of the ground when temperatures are accommodating.  I hope to see more of it tomorrow as temperatures are expected to be in upper teens in the morning. 
We hiked for some time in an area that had burned about 6 years ago. It is amazing how long it takes for the forrest to recover. The fire originated around Gatlinburg so it was a big one. I saw several birds today and enjoyed watching then flit and fly in front of us as we hiked. A major attraction for today was Siler Bald.  A bald, at least most of the time, is the top of a mountain with very few or no trees. Siler Bald is this type and is 5207 ft high and .2 miles off of the trail.  So those .4 miles, 2 up and. 2 back down  don't count for our total miles today.. It had 360° views and I wish I could include that video in this journal.  The views were spectacular,  beautiful and massive.  It was however,  very windy and cold so it didn't take me long to absorb the views. 
After that McDuck said its down hill the rest of the way so we husseled on down to Wayah Gap where Sherpa Al was waiting.  He took us to our luxury Sapphire Inn where we unloaded and quickly headed off to visit the 76 Outfitters.  McDuck had them on his must do list, so we must did. They recommended a couple of nearby eating places and we chose Mexican.  Another good choice. Then it was a brisk walk back to our Inn. It was comical checking in to this place. All the doors to the lobby were locked and the sign said call this number phone located to your left.  So  I punched in the numbers and nothing happened.  As I started to try again a young lady appears slides open small window and ask if she can help me. I said I have reservations for two rooms.  She says, do you have any pets? A couple of replies ran through my mind but I answered no. She said,  did you make reservations on line? I replied yes. She said,  what site did you use? I  had no idea but showed her my reservation confirmation email and she seemed happy with that. She then said, do you have any pets? Again, I filtered through my replies, but it was cold because we are standing outside so I stuck with no. She then takes my ID and credit card and goes behind the counter in her warm lobby and starts on the computer.  After a couple of confusing additional questions and clarifications she again asked me if I had any pets. One more time my mind raced through the possible answer but thankfully stopped on no. We eventually got the Keys to our rooms and were happy to get inside. Another portion of this incredible adventure. 
 Today we did 9.5 miles from Rock Gap to Wayah Gap 23,547 steps 28° low 34° high. Tomorrow is Wayah Gap to Cold Springs Shelter 9.9 miles and that will put us at mile 125.2.

TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660828,"The theme for today was slip sliding away.  Over the last couple of nights in the upper teens and low 20s the trail had frozen solid.  When today's temps warmed up the trail began to thaw, thus the slipping commenced. Jeff from Kansas won the longest slide with a 30 to 32 inch slide.  I'm very happy to report that there was no slippy falley!
We started this morning after a delicious McDonald's breakfast and after another excellent shuttle ride from Sherpa Al. He is mo better than most. Jeff from Kansas was in the lead and thought it best to take us up fast and hard, so I was in full locomotive breathing just moments from leaving the shuttle.  Lots of uphill this morning as we headed for the Wayah Bald Fire Tower at 5337 ft.  It was so beautiful up there. We could see where we had come from a few days ago at Albert Fire Tower and where we will be in about one week Clingmans Dome.  Thats pretty cool stuff! We also had a nice visit with some very nice sightseers who had lots of questions about us and our thru hike. And, if that wasn't enough I was even able to share that time with my wife Gorgeous by Whatsapp video calls. Thats more gooder than it gets!
Soon we were headed down from the Wayah Fire Tower and at one point we were walking down this old rough fire road when we heard sirens coming.  Then all of the sudden down this bumpy road comes an ambulance,  and it was going way to fast. It blows by us going down the mountain hits a big bump and wham, the back doors fly open and out flys a small ice chest.  It skids down the road as the ambulance keeps on going.  Not knowing what else to do we walk down pick up the ice chest and look inside.  There was a severed big toe! What to do now?  Well we thought the ice chest might be a good seat at camp tonight so we took it with us. Your asking well,  what did you do with the toe? We called a TOW truck! Tee hee hee hee! If your in that special class have someone esplane that to you. And no there was no ambulance or toe.
We rolled into camp around 3:30 pm found some really nice tent spots with most excellent sunrise views. Woo hoo! Got our camp chores completed met Scotty a nice young man from Scotland.  We visited with him for several minutes. Next we ate lunch dinner combination.  

It wasn't long after that the sun started to get low in the sky and the temps started down and it got cool. That means this hiker is wanting in his sleeping bag. 
Today was Wayah Gap to Cold Spring Shelter 9.9 miles 25,151 steps, low of 38° high of 54°. Tomorrow we head for the NOC which is the Nantahala Outdoor Center 11.5 miles away.  We need some resupply and if the mood strikes us we may stay the night indoors.

TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660870,"Brrrrr! Cold again last night with a low of 27°, but as the morning broke it started warming quickly.  We were up before 7:30 enjoying the sunrise but I waited to get out of my tent until about 8am. Morning chores and eating took us to about 9:30 and we were off. McDuck took the lead and never looked back. 
The trail was pretty good to us this morning and it took awhile before I was ready to shed a layer.  We had a couple of climbs including the one up to Wesser Bald Fire Tower. The views were awesome! Once again the sky was blue and clear and we could see for miles. We enjoyed visiting with a couple there after soaking up the views. After some snacks McDuck hollered, anybody not ready, which is code for time to move on you slackers. So off we went on a mostly downhill section.  Soon we had entered a section of forest that was full of dead trees and many of those trees had blown down across the trail.  I would say that at least every 100 yards there was a tree that we either had to step over,  climb over, go around, climb through, duck under or a combination of any of them.  My least favorite is the ducking under. It is a killer on the lower back and legs. This went on for miles, thus every time we had to step or climb over a tree it was a hiker hurdle. 
After a few miles we started hiking on a ridge. Beautiful views on our right and left and steep drops on our right and left. At one point I looked up and there was nothing in front of us. The ridge turned right and you were left standing on the point of the ridge with nothing on three sides. Very scary yet very beautiful at the same time.  My good friend said Scott let me get your picture there, and when I stopped he said take one big step to your left. I don't think so, there was nothing but air to my left. I can't wait to see my mom and tell on him. That ridge section continued on for a good while with some very challenging trail that at times required both feet and both hands to negotiate. There were lots of anxious moments for me in that section.  Not long before we reached the NOC here coms May (the dog) and her human. They were flying down the trail and May kept looking back like hurry up human.  Then it was more knee burning downhill until we came to the NOC.  
Once there we stopped at the general store to see about lodging.  They said they have a nice private room that sleeps 4, showers and restrooms are communal. We jumped right on that deal. Then we find out that it is at the top of the hill and when we opened the door we discovered that we had a 10X10 room with 4 bunks. However,  it is climate controlled. I'll give you one guess who is controlling the climate.  Give up? Wasn't me!I I choose to call it cozy. 
Then it was back down the hill to register for the Smoky Mountains only to find out that the store had closed at 5pm. We'll have to try again in Fontana in two days.  Next choice was to eat and we did. We got to watch some kayakers do their thing in the river which was fun. After dinner we went back to the general store because if you plan to take a shower,  and we did, towels are $3 to rent. Then it was back up the hill to get some clean or cleaner cloths and head for the showers, which lucky for us are just 1 building away. Now our chores are done. 
That means for today we hiked from Cold Spring Shelter to the NOC 11.5 miles 31,598 steps, low was 27° high was 68°. Tomorrow is supposed to be rainy and we plan to hike 13.8 miles to Stecoah Gap.  Lots of elevation gain I'm told. Yippee!

TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660895,"We were up and out of our luxurious accommodations at the NOC around 8:30 am heading up. Today's elevation gain was over 4700 ft. It was raining when we left the NOC and was raining as we pulled into the Wing and Hoof Bed and Breakfast in Bryson City. Now to be fair there were a few moments today when it didn't rain.
Not really any views with the heavy cloud cover but we did catch the clouds below us which was cool.  Right after taking a picture of the clouds I took off as it was my day to lead and Jeff from Kansas said, that's not the right way. I replied I think it is, so off we went. Then McDuck said I think we've already been this way. Well after some negotiations we headed the way I wanted and about 10 steps later there were hikers coming right at us.  I said,  what direction are you heading.  They replied North.  I immediately turned around and said wrong direction. That means I win the badge for being the first to go the wrong way. Yea me! There was another badge awarded today.  The badge for the 1st fall was awarded to Jeff from Kansas.  I didn't see it but I hear it was spectacular,  and no foul words were heard. 
We saw a few other brave wet souls today, one of them being Scotty from Scotland.  Man can he hike! 
As we got within a couple of miles of Stecoah Gap McDuck suggested the next time we can get out of the wind we should see if we can get a shuttle and make arrangements for tonight.  Jeff from Kansas connected with Amy from Wing and Hoof who came and picked us wet dogs up. She then proceeded to sell us on her Bed and Breakfast place. She really didn't have to try very hard because when she said hot showers, laundry and free shuttles for town food we were in. We get to her place and she insisted that we go in muddy shoes and all, escorted us to our upstairs room,  and told us to make ourselves at home.  We raced to see who got the shower 1st and Jeff from Kansas won.  After we were clean Amy drove us into town along with a couple of sisters and we enjoyed Italian food.  
Back at the Bed and Breakfast who should we find. None other than our friend Pink. He said Freya and Beans, formally known as Colby Jack are here also. Perhaps we will get to have breakfast together in the morning. 
We are trying to dry as much as we can for tomorrow. So, for today it was NOC to Stecoah Gap 13.9 miles 35,360 steps, low 45° high 52°. Tomorrow Stecoah Gap to Fontana 15.1 miles.

First off the stay with Amy at Wing and Hoof Bed and Breakfast could not have gone any better.  Amy is a hard worker and made it look easy to take care of 12 wet dirty hikers. And as a bonus I got to be serenaded to sleep by Pink's singing and harmonica playing.  Special memories being made .
We were dropped off back at Stecoah Gap around 9:30 am. Jeff from Kansas was in the lead and he safely guided us across the busy road to the start of our trail for today. Our 1st 1/4 mile or so was in the protective orange petting zoo fencing.  I felt so safe. Our 1st climb today was a doozy. They called it Jacob's ladder and at the top I didn't see any Angels but I was seeing stars for sure.
After that the trail mellowed out nicely for most of the rest of the day. There were not many real clear views, however,  we enjoyed seeing the big mountains all around us for most of our day. At one challenging section I put my left foot on a rocky crag and it just kept on sliding until my hind end was on said rocky crag.  Now I'm not a doctor nor do I play one on TV, but I don't think there was any permanent damage. That is why at the top of my page I now have my merit list. Any time I fall, go the wrong direction or some other worthy event I will award myself a merit badge and keep track of them. 
Again the trail was kind to us until near the end of our day. Up we started again on a long steep section.  About half way up McDuck said they should call this Esau's ladder. As we huffed and puffed our way to the top there it was in all its splendor and beauty.  Fontana Lake! It is really a sight to behold. Now at this first view point, we are still about 4 trail miles from the lake and it felt like it took hours to finally actually get to the lake. The bright spot in that 4 miles was getting to see the Trillium beginning to bloom. 

 
Upon arrival we went first to the Marina to get our Smoky Mountain Permits and some resupply for the next 3 days. After that successful exercise we called for the shuttle to the lodge and checked in. We then journeyed down the hill to the restaurant and I had a pizza.  We enjoyed sharing our table with Scotty from Scotland and learning more about him.  
After dinner it was back to the room to get organized for the next 3 days. Lots of miles to cover and we wanted to see how best to break it up.
Today we went from Stecoah Gap to Fontana Marina 13.7 miles 34,463 steps,  low 31° high 47°. Tomorrow we plan to go from Fontana Marina to Russell Field Shelter about 16 miles.  Should be a big day

The shuttle bus picked us up right at 9 am and we were walking around 9:30. It was a couple mile walk from the Marina to the Fontana Hilton,  which is reported to be the nicest shelter on the trail. It has charging stations and indoor bathrooms.  From there we made it to the Fontana Dam and walked across it. Next we deposited our permits in the appropriate box. Another of the things you always read about.  Then we started up and there was alot of that today.  We made the .1 mile hike up to Shuckstack Fire Tower.  Fantastic views all around. Then it was a march the rest of the day. We covered lots of miles and the sun was bright and the air was cold.  We enjoyed the early views this morning but by afternoon we were in the woods the rest of the day. 
There was another fall today,  wasn't meeee,  and no permanent damage was noted. We rolled into a very full Russell Field Shelter around 5 pm, set up tents,  completed our chores and ate. Brrrrrr it was cold. Now we're all in a sleeping bags finding warmth.  The rumor is that 15° is the low tonight.  More brrrrrrrr.

It got colder than a well diggers po po deeeeep in the Klondike last night.  We registered 16° as we were getting up and packing up our gear.  We chose to eat on the trail as we were just too cold. 
Today was a tough beautiful day to hike. Our 1st big climb was to the top of Rocky Top. So we sang what we could remember of the song, even though this is Rocky Top North Carolina,  not Tennessee. 
We saw lots of snow today along with freezing rain in the trees and when the sun shown on them it was beautiful.  Later in the day we were working down a tough down hill when my left foot slipped so I planted the right foot which continued to slide and I  started turning to my left which put my backside towards the down hill side of the mountain.  Well as you might guess over the side I went. Thank the dear Lord that about 15 years ago He caused a tree to grow right there cause that tree broke my tumble.  Yea tree! Again no permanent damage was noted, but I got another merit badge. 
We hiked hard and were worn out by the time we reached Silar's Bald Shelter.  It is warmer tonight but still plenty cool. We ate,  did our chores and are sleeping in the shelter tonight. 
So, from Russell Field Shelter to Silar's Bald Shelter  it was 14.7 miles 37,520 steps low 26° high 44°. Tomorrow we aim for Newfound Gap 12.2 miles. And then I get to see my Sweetheart! Woo! Hoo!

If you hadn't noticed the colder it got the shorter my journal entries became. The past two days have been mighty cold as both McDuck and my thermometer registered 13° two nights ago.  In a tent, that registers as cold! We did have some beautiful sections to hike those day with early views on both days. The views looking back to Fontana Lake were really nice and the sun shining on the ice in the trees yesterday was spectacular. Also the 360° views from Rocky Top left us talking about all the mountains we had hiked. 
After a cold night we packed up and headed off with Jeff from Kansas in the lead. Soon we were in a thick pine forest with moss covering most everything.  It was a really beautiful walk. We had that most of the way to Clingmans with the last couple of miles on a ridge with views back to the mountains we hiked in past weeks to our right and views of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge areas to our left. Then we saw it, Clingmans Dome. We new we were close and with the last big climb we were at the base of the tower.  And, drum roll please,  we reached the 200 mile mark! Woo! Hoo! And Cool Beans! We now have just less than 2000 miles to go. 

Coming down fron Clingmans Dome we were hoping for some quick trail to get us to Newfound Gap and Gorgeous and Big O and Iron Pants. Those are the trail names for my sweet wife and my Dad and Mom. What we did find was lots and lots of ice. The trail at times was a frozen stream which made goin down very difficult.  One of us fell twice, trying to not let the others of us get too many falls ahead. Once again much of this afternoon was spent in the pine forest and when we weren't eyes glued to the icy trail we were enjoying the pine trees. 

 
We saw lots of day hikers out since its spring break in this part of America and boy did they ever smell good.  I would bet you thats not what they said about us. Just before we arrived at Newfound Gap parking lot we saw this gorgeous young woman sitting on the side of the trail and as we got closer I recognized her to be my sweet wife.  What a lovely surprise! She guided us on in to the parking lot right into some trail magic.  Now thats a win win. 
After a couple of pictures we hopped into the car heading to Pigeon Forge and checked into our deluxe accommodations.  From there we went to The Old Mill restaurant and ate really really good.  Great choice Jeff from Kansas. Our waiter was very interested in our hike and what we would do if we encountered an a bear. Then it was back to our deluxe accommodations and time for a much needed shower.  Ahhhh, now that felt soooooo Gooooood! 
So, for today,  we went from Silar's Bald Shelter to Newfound Gap 12.2 miles 31,332 steps low 25° high?? Tomorrow lots and lots of rest and perhaps a town chore or two.","Silar's Bald Shelter

After a comfortable night's rest, in a real bed, in a climate controlled environment, in our luxurious accommodations, it was time for more food.  Gorgeous and I made our way down to the lobby for breakfast.  Gorgeous had a small apple cinnamon waffle, a piece of cinnamon raisin bread, fruit cup, yogurt, coffee and juice.  I had biscuit and gravy, scrambled eggs, cinnamon raisin bread, yogurt, lots of juice and some hot tea.  While we were eating in came McDuck and Jeff from Kansas with well rested looks on their faces ready for breakfast.  Not long after that my parents showed up so we all enjoyed breakfast together. 
Then it was back to the room to get started on town chores.  Laundry, cleaning my spork and cold soaking jar, back flushing my water filter, repairing my rain pants ( thanks Gorgeous), charging all electronics, working on damaged feet and hands, and taking inventory of food for a resupply run tomorrow and all of the other little things that need to be done.  In between all of those things our feet were up resting. 
Jeff from Kansas needed to mail something home so we all piled into the car and took him to the Post Office.  While we were out we decided to eat again.  We found Mel's Classic Diner a 50's style diner and all had a nice lunch,  well all but Jeff from Kansas,  he had a nice breakfast again. Some of us even had ice cream for dessert. 
Back to our luxurious accommodations this cowboy was ready for a nap and boy was it a good one. After naps we relaxed in the room till around 7 pm and then it was food time again.  I could get used to three square meals a day. The Local Goat was the choice for us tonight along with a large number of other people.  After a short wait we were seated and enjoyed our dinner.  
Back to our luxurious accommodations it was well past hiker midnight so we headed for a nice soft bed in a climate controlled environment. Today zero miles 1,566 steps.  I have no idea what the low and high was. Tomorrow more of the same.

Ahhhhhh! That's how nice its been to have a couple of zero days.  After another good night's sleep in our luxurious accommodations we headed down for what could be described as replay of yesterday's breakfast.  
Then around 10am we headed to the local Wally World for our resupply.  I think we might be improving at this resupply thing. My food bag is still heavy, but I came out $20 cheaper. That's improvement isn't it? While in the store there was a problem with things just magically appearing in my basket.  Jeff from Kansas,  do you have any knowledge of this hanky panky? After that we got petrol for the car and stopped back by the Post Office,  what is it with Jeff from Kansas and the Post Office anyway? Then it was back to the luxurious accommodations.  About 1pm we headed out for lunch.  Sushi was on the menu and boy oh boy was it good. Then it was a quick stop at the local REI for a few supplies and back to our luxurious accommodations. 
A nap was high on my priorities and was very nice.  We relaxed the rest of the afternoon until dinner time, when we went to Texas Roadhouse for a steak dinner.  Yum yum! I don't think it was a record for McDuck but seven rolls later he said that will do. The decision was made to head for the hills by 8;30am which should put us hiking around 9:30. 
Today was zero miles 3,269 steps and the low and high were not gathered, although it did get warm today. Tomorrow we plan a 10.5 mile treck to Pecks Corner Shelter.  Back to the mountains we go. I am so very grateful for my sweet wife and great parents coming out and providing us a couple of days rest. We were most definitely in need.  Thank you so much for your support!

After a two day rest in Pigeon Forge my Dad, Mom, and wife drove us back to Newfound Gap where we took a few pictures and said our tearful good byes and then began hiking. 
It was a warm beautiful morning and the trail was kind to us most of the day.  The first uphill section was very muddy and I was happy to be going up it not sliding  down it. After a little while we were back in the big tall pine forest with a carpet of green over everything.  It is so beautiful to see. Then we started walking a narrow ridge which led us to Charlie's Bunion. This is a rock out crop that drops off very steeply.  After a scary picture or two we were back on trail.  Then for most of the rest of the day we would walk through a tall pine forest covered in green, then round a corner and find a more open area with hardwoods,  then come out of that yo a very narrow ridge walk, the into a scrubby brushy area with a few small pines, then round a corner and the whole scene would start over again.  I'm not sure how many times it repeated but it was several and that kept the day very interesting.  Along the way were several gorgeous views of endless mountain ranges.  I continue to be in awe of the creation God has made. In one of the big tall green carpeted pine forest sections there was a bird or a couple of birds singing so pretty.  I couldn't help but imagine that they were singing praises to God.
Soon we were headed down the .4 mile trail to our shelter for the night.  Upon arrival we were greeted by a couple who informed us that they had six spots reserved in the 12 person shelter.  The also informed us that they would not be using any of them and that we could use them. That was very kind of them to do that for us as non thru hikers have 1st right to shelter spaces in the Smokies. Now we can claim a shelter spot and not worry about getting bumped out later that evening/night. 
Since we got to camp about 3pm we had time for a nice snack before supper time. We finished off supper just after 6pm and thats about when several other hikers showed up. I was so glad we had claimed spots. I was in my bag by 7pm ready for the night.

So thankful we were in a shelter last night.  As predicted a thunderstorm moved in around 3:30 and we had a little thunder, a little lighting, a little hail, a little wind, and a little rain. Yet we were warm and dry in the shelter.  Woo hoo!
The shelter was up and active by 7:30am so we started our morning routine and by about 9 am we had started back towards the trail.  The shelter we stayed in was .4 miles off the trail and we journeyed that .4 miles back. That .8 miles didn't count towards our AT miles.
Today was my turn to lead and away we went at a slow steady pace.  We walked most of the morning in the tall pines covered in the green moss, or what I call the Enchanted Forest.  I don't think I would ever get tired of that kind of hiking.  There were a few places for views but not many.  We hiked by a helicopter landing site and it was on a fairly narrow ridge making for a spooky landing.  Not long after that was the site where a military plane crashed in 1984. For a significant portion of the day we walked on rocks. Big rocks, medium rocks, small rocks, and more rocks.  Sometimes the rocks were in a rolling stream, sometimes in the mud, and sometimes it was just the rocks. My feetjust know they were tired of the rocks for today.
We rolled into the shelter around 3pm finding a group from Alabama out for weekend of hiking. I ate my lunch, gathered water and started working on Relive Videos, and this journal. Soon I started hearing commotion up at the shelter, I inquired as to what be happening and found out that the Alabama crew decided to go in tonight.  Now, there's more room in the shelter.  Tonight we have with us The Weatherman, Bambi, Waldo, and a few others that I haven't identified. 
 
After my gourmet dinner things started to cool down and I began to long for the warmth of my sleeping bag. I try my best not to get in it until around 7 but sometimes thats a chore. 
So until bag time I'll enjoy the view of the valley in front of the shelter.

Up a little earlier than we normally are this morning letting us enjoy the last part of the sunrise.  As we were getting around we had a morning mountain shower which lasted right up to the time we started hiking, how convenient. 
Today Jeff from Kansas was in the lead and probably for the 1st time thus far we started downhill instead of uphill. The day as a whole was mostly downhill and the trail was kind to us again today.  There were not many views as we hiked but as we got close to Davenport Gap 4 very energetic young people came upon us offering trail magic. Newfound, Blossom, Goodnews and Unfiltered were hiking up the trail we were hiking down giving out Capri Sun, oranges, chips, cheese sticks and other treats.  They were thru hikers from last year paying back the magic.  Not long after that we could see Davenport Gap and what appeared to be a table set up. Our hearts began to beat faster and our excitement level increased as we thought it might be more trail magic.  Sure enough Stan the Man, Monarch and Zoby (the dog) had a spread for those of us finishing the Smokies. Hotdogs, hamburgers, strawberries, grapes, chips, and cold drinks were available and I said yes to it all. Yum yum! Thanks to all of those that showed complete strangers kindness like this. It does the heart good to experience goodness like this 1st hand. 
After about an hour we finally drug ourselves away and hiked on. We soon had the pleasure of hiking next to a very pretty stream for awhile.  So soothing to hear and watch the stream. Next was the crossing of I 40. We could hear it for awhile, then we could see it and finally we went right under it. Shortly after that we strolled into Standing Bear Farms. We got the 1st class tour, decided to take the deluxe cabin that sleeps six for the three of us and there are showers available and we don't have to rent the towels. Yea! They serve a meal at night if you'd like or they have frozen pizza and an oven. Washing clothes is on a hand rub board  but they do have an electric dryer.  Go figure? The privy is being re-done so they have two port-ta-pottys and I would suggest you use them quickly, as they are at capacity.  Yuck! Lots of hikers we know are hear including..... you guessed it Pink. Waldo, Beans, Bambi, Oz, and several others perhaps I will meet at supper which is served sometime between 5pm and 7pm. We are clean and comfortable tonight. The dinner bell rang right at 7pm and we came a running.  It was a large plate of Mexican food, and it hit the spot. After eating we sat around the fire for awhile enjoying the conversation. When I started getting cool I retired for the evening. 
Final thoughts on the Smokies. First half extremely challenging, lots of challenging trail and lots of inclines and declines. Not the Smokies fault but we encountered some temperature challenges also in this half with the high one day of 21° and the low a bone chilling 13°. Clingmans Dome was cool and the high point on the trail.  The second half started out just as difficult if not worse with challenging declines and a icy trail that made hiking a big challenge. After that the trail began to be much kinder and easier on us old hikers. BUT, the highlight of the Smokies was getting to see my Sweetheart and spend a few days with her. Pitter patter goes my heart! I was also blessed to have my Mom and Dad join us and give us a couple days rest. So, the Smokies are in the rear view mirror now, one more thing to check off the hikers list. Cool Beans!

We were up around 7:30 taking care of morning chores.  It was a nice morning and the Standing Bear Farms Hostel was already working alive. If you wanted, breakfast was served for an additional $8 but I had already consumed my breakfast. Around 8:30am we were on the road from Standing Bear back to the trail.  Today the trail went up, two hours into the morning and we were still climbing up. However, before we get to the top of the first climb we must tell of the morning excitement. 
About a mile in my phone rings and, of course, I ignore it, and soon McDuck's phone rings on silent, then Jeff from Kansas phone rings and he answers it.  It was the head lady from Standing Bear Farms and she was trying to reach the guy who didn't pay out and she thought that guy was me. After Jeff from Kansas answered a few of her questions and wowed her with his command of the english language she recognized her error and we resumed our hiking. I suppose my dynamic personality was lost on her when I was paying out.
 
Back to hiking have I mentioned that we went up a lot today. It was another day of over 5000 feet of elevation gain,  and with McDuck in the lead that ment for a tough day. As we reached the top of Snowbird peak we encountered an aviation beacon.  Now thats not something you see everyday. Our big view for the day was Max Patch Bald.  There was a 360° view there of the big mountains in the distant, some we have climbed and some that we will climb in days to come. From there it was just a couple more miles to Roaring Fork Shelter our home for the night. We settled in and did our evening chores. After Todays effort, I predict an early bag time tonight. Tonight it is the three of us, Bambi, Waldo, Oz, Karaoke and a couple I didn't get names for.

We aimed for Deer Park Mountain Shelter today and we walked right past it. How did that happen, you asked? Let me tell you. We, as in all six of us in the shelter which included Karaoke, Waldo, Jeff from Kansas, Bambi, McDuck and I were in full get up and get going mode by 7:15am. By around 8am we were on the trail.  The hike this morning was very mild and we spent much of our time hiking by creeks, one of my favorites.  
We had a couple of nice climbs today the 2nd one put us on top of Bluff Mountain at 4680 ft. From there we spent several hours going down at a very nice decent, and by the time we were near our intended shelter we had decided that, since it was raining lightly and supposed to rain more during the night, and since the trail had been really nice today, and since it was only another 3.2 miles to Hot Springs NC where there would be town food and a real bed, it was easy to walk right past it. So we did just that. The trail was busy today, we saw several other day hikers on trail one of them being a large group of young adults. Not many views but beginning to see lots of little colorful flowers covering the forest floor. Also beginning to hear more birds singing and seeing lots of Robins.  Today I also saw a chipmunk and a grey squirrel.  
As we rolled into town McDuck said there was a Diner just inside town that we should stop and eat at and while eating figure out where we should stay. It was a great place to eat and the nice ladies there suggested the place we are staying.  Great idea McDuck! Also they have the ATsymbol made right into the sidewalk. Later we went to a brick oven pizza place which was packed and enjoyed a pizza.  When we walked in the place Freajy and Voodoo were there to greet us. I'm always amazed at who we see in the different places. After pizza it was time for the most important meal of the day.  Thats right, you know what I'm referring to. Ice Cream! Then back to the room to work on dirty bodies and dirty clothes. 
Today we went from Roaring Fork Shelter to Hot Springs 18.1 miles a new high miles mark for us. 41,148 steps. Low was 38° high 63° Tomorrow we will extend our originally planned NERO into a ZERO and take care of those town chores.

The birds sang me awake this morning.  It took me a second or two to remember where I was.  Another chilly morning as the temps were in the low 30s, yet we were in a toasty warm room. Ahhhhhhhh!
Headed for breakfast back to the Smoky Mountain Diner and again enjoyed their good food and excellent service. On the way back we visited the Dollar General store to see what they had for resupply.  Lots of empty spots on the shelves.  McDuck was able to find an item or two but I came away empty handed. Around 1pm we walked back to town to do some shopping, drop by the Post Office and eat. The store had a unique selection of items and we got a few items, Jeff from Kansas has a ""thing"" for Post Offices and visited them again, and I got to eat again. Afterwards we hit several possible resupply options and even though we didn't find all we were looking for, I'm certain that we will all carry food into Erwin TN. Back at our lodging we kicked up our feet and chilled out for the afternoon. McDuck spent untold hours plotting our next few days and thanks to him we now know what our plan for the next few days is. 
About 6pm Jeff from Kansas knocked on our door ready for more food.  Actually I'm not sure any of us were ready but at 7 pm most places close,  so away we went.  After dinner we stopped by the store with ice cream but the only flavor they had left was raspberry sorbet. I had it the night before and it wasn't good so we all passed on the most important meal of the day. 
Next it was get the backpack ready for an early start in the morning.  After that it was shower time,  journal time and night night time. 
Today was zero day 6,151 steps and tomorrow our plan is to hike to Little Laurel Shelter 19.5 miles. We are hoping for an early start to our biggest day thus far.

Wow! I did say Wow! I meant to say Wow! What a day it was. But 1st lest I miss an opportunity, this morning on our way to breakfast one of us needed to stop by the Post Office again this morning.  I will not mention any names to protect someone. 
Back to Wow, and Surprises.  We left Hot Springs this morning around 7:30am walked out of town crossed the French Broad River turned right and proceeded to walk alongside said river for a time and it was beautiful. While walking along side the French Broad River someone asked what the French Broads name was? Yes we laughed about that much. So surprise number one was the French Broad River.
Then as we hiked through the woods I began to see these little purple, yellow, and white flowers, about the size of a button on a shirt, dispersed along the trail.  There were also flowers about the size of a quarter that were white with yellow in the middle. As I admired the flowers I imagined God saying to me, can you see Me, do you see Me? I answered with a resounding YES! Surprise number two.
Next was our day in general.  We hiked 19.4 official miles, a new record.  We hiked about 6500 feet of elevation,  a new record.  We hiked for about 9 hours,  a new record,  and we had 45,735 steps.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well we did with that big of a day. Maybe, just maybe we are beginning to get some trail legs under us. So surprise number 3 how well this day went.
And last but certainly not least we had two different trail magic episodes. The 1st one was as we were taking a side trail to walk up to the Rich Mountain Fire Tower, two guys hollered,  are you guys thru hikers, we replied yes, they said after you see the tower come get some trail magic. So we did. The views from the fire tower were amazing.  Again you could see 360° views of places we have been and places we will go soon. After that we met Uconn ras Boutonn and Zig Zag. They shared chips and cold drinks and some great stories.  They were also rotisserie cooking a chicken on their fire. Did it ever smell good.  The 2nd one was The Cookie Lady! As we came down to a road there was a sign that said Cookie Lady this way. We journeyed down their drive to their awesome little log cabin and met Tim and The Cookie Lady.  She had made oatmeal cookies and they were fabulous.  That was just about perfect to push me on to the shelter.
Today was from Hot Springs to Little Laurel Shelter 19.4 miles, low 33° high 71°, see steps above.  Tomorrow we are aiming for Flint Mountain Shelter 14 miles.

Up around 7:15 this morning as Bambi was getting himself around getting the rest of us to stir. As we were going thru our morning chores Jeff from Kansas had gone over to the bear cables to get our food bags down and much to our surprise mice had chewed two holes in his food bag. Not good! Upon closer inspection the two holes led to his tortillas and his M&M's. He had eight tortillas and the mouse managed to chew through all eight of them. Needless to say that's not how you want to start your day. But before we got out of camp we celebrated McDuck's birthday with each of us sharing a 3rd of a snack bar. 
We got out of camp about 8:30am on a cool rainy morning and immediately made a tough climb.  I was soon in full locomotive mode.  We hiked on till we came to a sign that said Exposed Ridgeline Trail or Bad weather Trail.  McDuck was in the lead and the Ridgeline trail was selected. It was quite fun and challenging as we climbed over boulders around crags and several times we put the poles in one hand and scrambled up or down a section. It was a lot of fun and the views were spectacular! It seemed we were on top of the world and could see it all from up there.  It was also cool, damp, and very windy so we kept on moving. 
Later we stopped for a quick snack at Jerry's Cabin Shelter and that helped us power on for the day. Another hiker that we've hiked with and around is Weatherman.  He is a Doctor from Canada and today we leepfroged with him. Finally as we hiked over Big Butt Mountain we overtook him and he followed us into today's shelter. 
When we made it to the shelter Bambi was there to greet us. There were three other section hikers here also but they were all headed on north this evening. The Weatherman decided that he would move on also tonight. As the evening moved on Rose and Bear Foot from New Zealand and Blue Grass from Georgia rolled in around 6pm. They had hiked from the 1st shelter after Hot Springs so they had had a big day. We enjoyed visiting with each of them. 
Today we went from Little Laurel Shelter to Flint Mountain Shelter 14.5 miles, 31,246 steps, low 43° high 62°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Bald Mountain Shelter 18.9 miles. It should be another big day.

Long before I ever started the Appalachian Trail I read a book called the Appalachian Trials yes Trials not trails. This book is a psychological look at hiking specifically the AT. What this book did was to get you to think about why you wanted to hike. It had you list out the reasons you would stay on trail and more importantly the reasons that would cause you to leave the trail. And as I worked through those questions there were obviously several reasons that would cause me to make the decision to return  home. After the last couple of weeks where I was fortunate enough to get to see family and how much I have missed them, and then knowing what I'm missing back home by being on trail, was when I made my difficult decision.. The heart wrenching decision I came to was to play this April Fools Joke on you,, my readers. April Fools!!
Well, congratulations to all of you faithful readers we are celebrating our one month anniversary on trail today. Can you believe that. I  know some of you also are reading McDuck's version of this adventure and he celebrated his one month after 28 days. I thank each one of you for being kind and not saying anything about that grevious error to him. One month and 300 miles down,  wow doesn't seem possible. 
On to todays adventure. We were up and spending time looking at the weather and discussing options for today.  Weather said rain this morning till around 11am then wind steady at 40 mph gust to 75 mph and a low of 26°.  Should we hike to the nearest shelter and wait it out, head to our originally planned shelter and hope for a spot in the shelter. Or do we see about bailing out at one of the road crossings.  Lots of choices.  So, what did we decide? Walk on to Bald Mountain Shelter 18.9 miles later and there were spots in the shelter.  Yea! 
Along the way one of McDuck's childhood friends that lives in North Carolina,  Ryan Lehman hiked up the trail to provide us trail magic of the best kind. Cokes, candy bars, bananas, and other goodies.  Then he hiked with us back to his car and there was more of the same plus a bag of beef jerky for each of us. It was so nice of him to drive 4 hours to make three stinky hikers so happy. Thank you Ryan!
Several big climbs today that left me breathing like a freight train, one was a long uphill treck right up a creek withe several water falls, but the biggest climb was up to Big Bald.  The wind was howling through those big tall trees whipping them around and I couldn't get the thought of one or more of them falling on me. Fear, kept me moving up the mountain. Just before reaching the bald we spooked 3 dear which was neat. Once we got onto Big Bald you needed to focus to stand up. We guesstimated that the wind was 60 mph or more. We took a few pictures of the absolute fabulous views and then stumbled our way off. 
 
Tonight we share the shelter with Rosie, Barefoot, Weatherman, and Blue Grass.  Supposed to be a cold one so we are sleeping with water filters and water bottles. And happy birthday to David!
Today was from Little Laurel Shelter to Big Bald Shelter 18.9 miles 43,597 steps,  low 50° high 62°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Erwin 14.6 miles.  Hopefully we will stay warm tonight.

Brrrrrr rabbit did it get cool last night, 26° was the temp when we got up.. The shelter did us proud keeping the wind off of us and the wind did blow.  It was predicted to be 75 mph and I don't think it missed it much if at all. Around midnight the wind started winding down and by morning it was calm. Around 10pm I was visited by a small fuzzy creature that quickly scampered across my shoulder and neck. Just thankful it didn't want in the sleeping bag. McDuck had a visit as well. No mice damage was noticed this morning. As we  were getting up the fog had frozen on the trees up towards the bald and in just a few minutes the fog moved through our area and froze on all the trees.  When the sun would peek thru it was magical. 
We, the entire shelter, was up by 8am and we were rolling onto the trail by 9am. My fingers were very cold and it took over an hour hiking to begin to feel normal again.  The hike out was, as McDuck described it, like being in a snow globe.  The gentle breeze would blow knocking the frost from the trees and we had sunshine and snow at the same time. Magical!
The trail this morning wasn't to bad till we hit Spivey Gap. We started up along side another pretty creek and up we went about 800 feet. I sounded like that locomotive again. It wasn't long after reaching the top that Jeff from Kansas started into what I thought was the Thumbooty dance but soon understood that it was the, there's a snake on the trail dance. I joined in briefly until we got it escorted off trail. I'm certain it was an extremely deadly species of snake,  but Jeff from Kansas disagreed with my assessment.  After that we started playing Leapfrog with Rosie, Barefoot and Weatherman.  Leapfrog on trail is when you pass someone on trail and latter that day they pass you back. This can happen for several reasons but often is because we each take breaks at different times during the day. 
The day turned out very beautiful with highs in the low 60s and little to no wind. Lots of downhill this afternoon as we moved in on Erwin TN.  The forest became the big pines and the ground had that green moss covering again.  Within a couple of miles of Erwin we began to get glimpses of the town and the Nolichucky River.  A pretty sight from high above.  We switched backed our way to a road leading to the bridge over the river and paused for a moment to catch our breath when a man drives up in a car and says I'm a shuttle driver where can I take you. We hopped in his car and he bought us to the Super 8 and our home for a couple of nights. 
Our feet and legs are weary after several bigger mile days and I am looking forward to resting them. We made the short trip to McDonald's and ate, then back to the hotel to clean some clothes and bodies. Once the clothes were clean as well as the bodies it was too hard to stay awake. 
Today we hiked from Big Bald Shelter to Erwin TN 16.9 miles 40,079 steps, low 26° high 61°Tomorrow will be a zero.  Woo hoo!

We were up this morning around 7:30 after a somewhat restful night.  My legs and feet took awhile before they were happy with me which made good sound sleeping difficult. They seem much happier tonight and that gives me hope of a great night of sleep. 
We made it to the hotel breakfast and I enjoyed two glazed donuts, and a large bagel with cream cheese.  Of course I had a couple glasses of orange juice to wash all that down. Then because the shower in the room we were in had either very hot or very cold water and no hope for blending the two temperatures to a tolerable temperature, we moved rooms. We did a little more laundry,  visited with some family by phone, napped, cleaned and organized our stuff and rested. 
About 12:30 we got ahold of Steve, the shuttle driver from yesterday and he hooked us up with G-Man who shuttled us to Primos Italian for lunch and then Walmart for a resupply.  I think I'm getting better at resupply however,  when they don't have what I had planned my substitute decisions become challenging. On the way back to the hotel G-Man took us by the local outfitters for other items.  Thanks again G-Man. 
Back to the room we then each packed our food bags in our own unique ways, mumbling about how much food we had and how heavy our bags were now. Then it was more relaxing and another nap before a little planning for our next section on into Hampton.  Then we went in search of more food. Interesting to me was that I went for a pre prepared chef salad and two ham sandwiches from the local Food Lyon. It did the trick in filling me up especially since the salad said it was four servings. 
This evening was more pack wrestling getting organized for getting back on trail in the morning.  Steve the shuttle driver will be here about 9am to take us back to the trail. 
Today zero miles 3,256 steps and high was intje 60""s. Tomorrow we are aiming for Cherry Gap Shelter 17.3 miles. This section we plan to stay in fewer shelters and more tent spots because the shelter placement is not as conducive to our hiking pace.

We were up eating our ""breakfast"" which consisted of four donuts and a bagel, and getting picked up by G-Man to be taken to the trail all by 8:30am. We crossed the bridge over the Nolichucky River and into the woods we went. It was a nice walk along the river and the railroad tracks and I think each of us was silently hoping for a train to come by. It was not to be as we turned up into the woods following a stream and up we went without the train. We crossed the stream several times on foot bridges that I believe were built by Boy Scouts.  Great job!
As we approached Indian Grave Gap we could see a truck parked with a big umbrella out. We started chanting trail magic, trail magic. Sure enough a gentleman had Lemonade, tea, water and some homemade breads. In honor of my son, whose trail name is Fred, I had an Arnold Palmer and I think his favorite dessert cranberry bread. We continued our climb until we reached the top of Beauty Spot and enjoyed the views from there. 
 
Then the climb really started.  Up to the top of Unaka Mountain, 5183 feet tall. On the way up the trail was covered in rocks or roots or at times both. At first it's kinda like a game, place the foot in a clear spot. As this game continues the eyes and mind are busy looking for the good spots and on parts of the trail you could not place your foot where there was not a rock or root or sometimes both. Eventually the the eyes and mind are still having fun but the feet begin to complain. You do your best to protect your feet,  but sometimes it's up to the trail to provide relief. 
As we reached the top of Unaka the forest turned into the big tall pines with the green moss covering everything.  So beautiful! The temperature dropped 15° once we had entered that shaded part of the forest. That left us with a small uphill before we reached the Cherry Gap Shelter our home for tonight.  
Lots of hikers on trail today some were obviously day hikers and several were slack packing. Slack packing is where you get a ride usually up trail and carry a very light pack back to where you started. It makes for great hiking and you usually get to stay in a Hostel or hotel that night. We also met some trail maintenance folks and we are very thankful for them.
We did all our shelter chores and I tried to eat all my food and failed.  That means I have to carry it again tomorrow. Tonight we share this shelter with Bambi, Easymoney, Elsa and her dog Piper, Jack, and Fixit along with several others who remain anonymous for now.

We got an early start out of Cherry Gap Shelter, Bambi was up early as he has a bad rash on his back and not feeling well so he was looking for a way to town. We got ourselves fed and around and were on trail by around 8am. 
We enjoyed a really nice trail for the first couple of of hours this morning. There were a few climbs that got our attention and we were happy when we rolled into Clyde Smith Shelter for a break. What we didn't know was that the water source was a long way down the hill and an even longer way back up the hill.  But I sure was in need of water. After our break we had a somewhat challenging climb to a nice view at Little Rock Knob Vista. Somewhere along in here we ran across Shooting Star, she hikes the trail occasionally and gives out special trail magic.  I got some kind of special toilet paper.  Its in a tablet form. You get it wet and it expands.  Ought to be an interesting trip to the privy.  Then we enjoyed a nice hike down to Hughes Gap Road.  From there it got interesting.  We climbed and climbed and climbed until my legs were saying no thank you to more climbing. Around Ash Gap I was out of water again and we made the long long trek to the spring there.  Amazing enough it was an even longer walk back up to our packs. Up hill seems to do that to me.
 For those of you that can remember yesterday's journal posted sometime this morning our original destination was Ash Gap tent site.  Well, before we even left Cherry Gap Shelter I had already heard enough whispers to guess that we would be pushing on to Roan High Knob Shelter.  So on we pushed another 1000 feet up to the shelter.  It is rumored to be the shelter at the highest elevation on the entire trail. It is also an enclosed shelter which is a plus. 
We were bushed when we rolled into the shelter and quickly claimed a spot and got our stuff spread out.  We ate, I did much better tonight,  collected water  hung our clothes out, and visited with the other hikers..I want to be sure and say Happy Birthday to Rosco a big one years old!

Yes indeed we were up early as one of the ladies in the shelter was quietly making a great deal of noise.  So up we got. Did all our morning chores and were rolling onto the trail about 8am. The start of the day was a rocky downhill but it wasn't so bad.  When we got to the road at the bottom of the mountain it was TRAIL MAGIC! Jared, from Texas, had all kinds of goodies in the back of his car and we enjoyed partaking of them. 
From there we started up the balds for today.  First came Round Bald and it presented a good climb and excellent views.  Then we moved over to Jane Bald with even more views. From there we made our way to Grassy Bald and again enjoyed the views.  As you went from bald to bald we were hiking out in the open and able to often see the trail of where you've been as well as where you're going. After Grassy Bald we made our way down to Yellow Mountain Gap because they want you to get the most out of the next climb.  It was now time to climb Little Hump and Hump mountains. Both were good climbs and again good views. Hump Mountain rings in at 5559 feet. Then what did we see right in the middle of the trail,  yes you are correct,  the sign saying Leaving North Carolina.  Woo Hoo, Yea, Cool Beans! Two states completed  twelve more to go. After our dance and wild celebration we continued the long downhill section to Highway 19E.
Our plan was to call for a Hostel once we got there.  We arrived and McDuck and Jeff from Kansas got busy working the phones finding out that all the places listed were booked for tonight.  The owner from 19E Hostel pulled up to pick up a group going to his place and offered several suggestions one of which was to call the Refuge Hostel. We did and that was a great move for us. A great guy Robert picked us up at the highway, took us to town so we could eat, picked us back up and brought us to their hostel. It is a great place. It has 8 bunks, some resupply, laundry   showers, kitchen, living area with movies and more for $20. Pretty amazing! We had nothing as we approached highway 19E and in a few moments we were more than taken care of by a really sweet couple. God is Good!
 
So, in the morning we are planning to slack pack around 17 miles.  Slack packing is carrying a very light pack instead of our full packs and Robert will pick us up at the end of our hike and bring us back to the hostel. Woo Hoo! And since it is supposed to rain tomorrow,  we can shower and wash and dry our wet clothes at the end of the day. Double Woo Hoo!
Today we hiked from Roan High Knob Shelter to Highway 19E a 16.3 day 37,344 steps, low 57° high 67°. Tomorrow we are aiming for SFS 293 13.7 miles to be picked up and brought back to the Refuge to be fed and cleaned up.

We are in a really nice hostel and since it was just the 3 of us I slept great! I started stirring just before 8am and our departure from the hostel would be about 8:45. I enjoyed a Jimmy Dean sausage egg and cheese croissant sandwich before we left.  About 10 minutes later we were dropped off at highway 19E and back on trail by 9am. There was a large group of hikers from the other hostels also being dropped off but Robert our hostel owner was the only one dropping us off on the trail head side so we wouldn't have to cross the very busy highway. 
Away we went and it wasn't long before we overtook Al and Poppa Smurf.  The hiking was pretty kind to us today with not too difficult of climbs and the rain held off for a couple of hours. As we walked we went past a fairly large cemetery called Isaacs Cemetery.  Shortly after that was a church where we crossed a road and headed up into a stand of tall pines that were in nice rows. The owner of the Refuge Hostel tells us that this is the Christmas tree growing capital, and they are being grown in most of the available spaces. Being a real Christmas tree kind of person it was neat to see them being grown. 
Back to the trail, just as we exited the stand of in line pines it started to rain. So we paused and deployed most of our rain gear. For me that consisted of umbrella and rain jacket.  If I had been thinking,  which is not often, I would also have deployed my rain pants.  By the time I had regretted not putting them on my pants were sufficiently wet that it would do no good to deploy them. So, I walked in my wet pants the rest of the day. We were busy hiking when McDuck said hold on stop. Jeff from Kansas and myself immediately stopped and turned around and we had walked past the 400 mile mark. Thanks McDuck for spotting the 400.
We crossed paths we several other slack packers some of them being Checkmate, and Joe, Kerri and Felix (dog) and they have their own Trail Journal spot if you'dlike to follow them. We enjoyed two beautiful water falls along our way today and walked near creeks and the Elk River often.  That's another one of my favorite trails is one by the creeks and or rivers. Not long before we got to the top of Walnut Mountain Road our bat signal spot, Jeff from Kansas took a nasty spill. After some moments of checking he thought he was fine and ready to continue. There may be a mark in the next day or two from that fall. Fortunately I don't believe there was any permanent damage to the tree. We made it to the Walnut Mountain Road and McDuck sent out the bat signal,  a text to the hostel owner,  that we were on schedule to be picked up and when we reached Forest Service Road 293 he was waiting to pick up three wet rats. 
 
It probably took another 10 minutes to get back to the hostel where we could shower, wash and dry our clothes and dry our gear before we get shuttled to town to eat. I'm thinking I could hike like this a lot! Around 4:15 Elsa and Piper (dog) joined us at the shelter. They were both soaked and ready to get dry. Shortly after that April the other owner came in ready to take us to town for food.  We decided on BBQ. It was a friendly place with good food and good sized portions so no one left hungry. Tonight I joined McDuck in getting a Dr. Enuf which is some kind of regional energy type drink. McDuck thinks they be good stuff. After getting shuttled back to the hostel we all visited for a bit and then slowly began to slip off to our own bunks. 
The internet is non existent until  midnight here so this entry will go out when I get up to go to the bathroom. Today we went 13.7 miles 30,798 steps and the low and high was 52°.

As bad as I hated to we packed up and left the good folks at The Refuge this morning as Robert dropped us off at FSR 293 and sent us packing off to Hampton.  
The trail was mostly kind this morning as we made our way up the mountain.  We walked along a stream for part of it getting to say River Crossing a bunch of times. The rain began again about mile 413 so we stopped at a shelter and put on rain gear. Today I tried to learn from my mistake of yesterday and deployed umbrella, rain jacket, rain pants and water proof mittens. It didn't take long for me to realize that it was a good decision.  Not only was I dry it helped keep me warm as the temperature dropped down to 33° and the cold wind blew. Around 1:45pm we made our way to the road where Aed was visiting with another thru hiker. We got some snacks, loaded up in the car and headed for town food.  
After eating we checked into our deluxe accommodations and organized and cleaned gear and napped.  Later we went on a resupply run and then on the most important errand of finding Dr. Enuff. After a stop or two we hit the jackpot. Then of course it was time to eat again. Back at the deluxe accommodations we showered and got ready for bed.
 
Today we hiked 11 miles 26,062 steps,  low 33° high 47°. Tomorrow is a zero day. We will get to attend church in the morning, eat, and lots of rest.

After a great night of sleep Aed and I were up for our gourmet Super Eight breakfast which consisted of hardboiled eggs, yogurt, ding dongs, bananas, fruit bars and juice. We enjoyed all we could and journeyed back to the room.  There was no sighting of McDuck or Jeff from Kansas. 
About 10:15 we headed out to find Central Church of Christ which was just a few minutes from our deluxe accommodations. There we enjoyed worshipping our God with fellow believers. 
Then we headed out for lunch, and if I may regress back to yesterday as we were discussing places to eat while driving into Johnson City, one of us suggested Cootie Brown's. Another one of us made it clear that he didn't want to eat at Cootie Brown's. So, when we pulled up today and parked in front of Cootie Brown's you can imagine my surprise. Now, I have experienced the fine quizine of Cooties, and I'm pleased to announce that we were all civil with one another thru the entire meal.
After Cooties for lunch Aed dropped us back at the hotel and he got on his way back to Hentown.  Thanks again brother for making the huge effort to come see us and provide us some really nice trail magic. You know what that makes you? A trail Angel!
The afternoon consisted of feet up and resting with just a touch of napping included. Sometime during the afternoon McDuck knocked on the door and asked if I was interested in an afternoon snack.  Absolutely I was! At lunch we had purchased a piece of Keylime pie and a piece of Carrot cake to go, so I was ready.  We split each of them and they were fabulous. Then about 7pm it was time for dinner.  We hopped in an Uber and at his recommendation we went to Kickback Jacks.  Lots of choices and we all were stuffed when we left. Back to the hotel we showered,  repacked,  yes I'm still doing that, and got organized for our morning departure. 
Today was a great worship and zero day, 1,226 steps.  Tomorrow we plan to hike 17.6 miles to the Vandeventer Shelter.

Wow! What a fantastic morning we enjoyed! I enjoyed another interesting breakfast from Super 8 and the nice shuttle driver was there right on time. It was around a 40 minute drive to our trail head this morning and as we pull in we can see that trail magic was being offered. So we unpack from the shuttle and meet Emoji the Trail Angel. Her 1st words were check out my trunk which was full of all kinds of goodies. As we were partaking Applesauce came over. We have run across her a time or two on trail and while eat we inquired as to how she got her trail name. She said its because my name is Kriss Cross.  Now I  know all of you teachers understand how she got her trail name,  but if it's not plain to any of you then go find a teacher especially one that teaches small children and they can explain it to you.
Back to the story. As we are finishing eating Emoji gave each of us a different poem that she had written. Mine was based on Psalm 46:10 Be still, and know that I am God. It was written while she was on top of Beauty Spot which we were just on a few days ago. I will try to add it to this journal.  It was so sweet that it brought tears to my eyes. All before we even started hiking. 
Then the hiking began.  The trail was great as we walked beside the Laurel Fork River.  Absolutely beautiful.  The further we walked the more rugged beauty we encountered. There were shear rock walls sometimes on both sides of the trail.  Way Cool! Then we reached a place where we went down what seemed to be a thousand rock steps. Those steps led us to Laurel Falls.  Beautiful big falls cascading down and the sun was catching them perfectly. Spectacular! After enjoying them we headed back along the trail as it continued to follow the river.  Sometimes we would be right next to it and sometimes we were a hundred feet above it. It was a fabulous morning.  To soon the trail left the river and headed up. 
Lots and lots of climbing ensured until McDuck said there's the lake. We had made it up high enough to see Lake Watauga.  We knew at some point we were going to cross the dam so we pressed on. After a bit we made it to the lake and a picnic area and stopped for a lunch break. Again such a beautiful mountain lake. After our break  we spent the rest of the day hiking around the lake. Every so often we would get a nice view of the lake.  Oh, and we did hike across the dam.
The afternoon got challenging as the last water source near the lake was non-existent and by the time we reached the next source it had been several hours and miles and we were dry. We sat at that stream and drank water for a while. Shortly after that we found the Vandeventer Shelter and there was room at the inn for us. We got situated, ate, did our evening chores and were ready for bed around 7pm.
Today we did 17.6 miles 41,349 steps, low 34° high 64°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Double Spring Shelter 14.5 miles.

Well, did you? Did you stop last night or today sometime and get real still and know that God is God. I hope so, if not O Why Not Tonight?
This morning Jeff from Kansas, McDuck, Monkey Toes and I were awakened by a very loud and persistent bird about 6:15am. Loud enough and persistent enough that I thought it was Monkey Toes alarm. Interestingly enough she thought it was one of our alarms. Nope just a bird that wanted us to be awake. Monkey Toes went ahead and got up, the rest of us laid there and snickerd at the bird. 
We finally all crawled out of our sleeping bags and got after morning chores. By 8:30 we were on trail.  Monkey Toes had about an hour head start.  The trail was fairly mild today.  It had its share of ups and downs but nothing to long or steep.  What it had in abundance today was hurdles.  I can hear you asking what is a hurdle? So glad you asked.  A trail hurdle is when a tree has blown down or just done did fell across the trail. I wish I had started counting them this morning because there were a bunch today. Big ones, little ones, even double hurdles.  So , to entertain myself while hiking, I say hurdle or hurdel as I step over each one.
As the morning moved on we caught up with Monkey Toes as she was eating and gathering water.  Then just before noon we stopped at the Iron Mountain Shelter for a snack and visited with a couple section hiking.  We also enjoyed some deer at that shelter.  Monkey Toes caught up with us there and hiked out with us as we left. Later after we had found trail magic at TN 91 provided by Sheepdog and Shutterfly, Monkey Toes caught up with us again and said she thought we had our trail legs since we had walked off from her. Trail magic was terrific.  Drinks, sausage biscuits, chips, little oranges, candy, and water.  Those two ladies knew exactly what we would need. Thank you both not only for the food but for being so kind to us.
From there we were about 3 miles from our home. For the night.  The 1st part of it was through someone's field gates and all then we entered the woods and climbed our way to the shelter. We have seen several SOBO hikers (South Bound) the last couple of days as this is a popular slack packing area. We were told by one man that he had counted 60 NOBO (north bound) hikers today headed for Damascus. Thats a bunch of hikers headed for a small town. 
Today we hiked 14.5 miles 32,010 steps low 45° high 64°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Damascus staying at Ladie Di's B&B 18.4 miles.

We were up early for us this morning as we had big miles planned for the day. Morning chores completed and some breakfast eaten put us on trail by 8am. We had just barely started when McDuck said you know you're on the road to Damascus,  and I hadn't thought about it like that, so I replied if I get struck down and start talking to someone you can't see you'll know what happened.  Several times today I tried to recall all of the details in Saul's conversion and tonight I plan to read those accounts and see how I did.
The trail was what I call moderate today.  We had plenty of up hill with some of that straight up the hill. Jeff from Kansas calls that a fullback dive. We spent a great deal of time on a ridge and could see views on either side through the trees.  One side we could see a lake and on the other we could see pasture or farm land. The big highlight of the day came late in the day as we made it to the Tennessee/Virginia state line. Pictures were taken and fist bumps given as we celebrated that achievement.  So, as Hawk, a 6 or 7 time thru hiker would say, Georgia check, North Carolina check, Tennessee check. 
Soon we rolled into Damascus where we came in between two homes walked down a street to the city's park where they have an iconic sign that welcomes you to Damascus.  Again, more pictures were taken and then we followed the white blazes and the AT symbol in the sidewalk thru town. 

 
We were looking to eat at the Damascus diner but to our disappointment it was closed. We continued on thru town until we came upon our home for the night,  Lady Di's B&B. Now I have had the honor and privilege of knowing a Lady Di for many years.  The Lady Di I've known is a sweet, kind, sympathetic, understanding, patient and I could go on and on about her positive qualities.  I'm hopeful that this Lady Di can measure up. We got greeted as we stepped up on the porch and instructions began immediately.  No packs or shoes inside were the first set of instructions. Then came the tour of the place with several more instructions. I paid close attention to the laundry and the breakfast instructions but mostly let the rest slide. Once officially inside I quickly found some loaner clothes and partook of a lovely shower. Then I got my dirty clothes in the basket provided and placed next to the chalkboard downstairs. 
Then Gorgeous and I finally got to visit as the last few days I didn't have enough cell signal to do that. Sabe, the trail name for my number two grandson, was at Grama's house and I got to visit with him also. Next it was off in search of food. With the Diner closed our two options were Subway and Wicked Chicken.  You got it we chose Wicked Chicken.  Lots of menu choices and the food was good.  Jeff from Kansas spotted a hiker we had seen on trail a couple of days ago sitting by herself, so he invited her to join us. We were glad Matilda and her human Micro could join us for dinner.  After dinner Micro treated us to ice cream.  Yum! Thank you Micro for that trail magic. 
Back to Lady Di's we were greeted by our baskets of clean laundry.  Very nice! We kicked back and relaxed working on journals.  We poked fun at each other because last night we were already in the sack at this time. 
Today we hiked 18.8 miles to Lady Di's in Damascus 42,074 steps low 43° high 73°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Saunders Shelter about 9 miles away.  In the morning we will have to take time to resupply so our departure time is up in the air for now.

Up this morning earlier than I had hoped but when there are 14 guests you just gotta go with the flow.  I put on my nice clean clothes and started gathering my stuff to return it to my pack which according to the instructions got to stay on the porch last night along with our shoes. Then it was time for breakfast.  Lady Di fixed an egg casserole type dish along with fancy French toast, sausage patties, and a berry smoothie. It was all delicious.  After that we followed the rest of the instructions and put our sheets and pillow cases in the hamper. Then it was off to the Food Lyon for resupply. That was about a two mile walk from where we were. We shopped and then as our habbit is we complained about how much food we bought on the two mile journey back to Lady Di's. Once there we packed up our food bags, while whining about how heavy they are, loaded up our backpacks, said our goodbyes and started up the road. 
We made it about 1/4 of a mile up the road to the local Subway and went in and each of us ordered a foot long sub and proceeded to eat all of it. Yum yum. Then it was out the door and up the trail. We got to start off with a lovely 1000 foot climb. The redeeming quality was we were very near Laurel Creek and the Creeper Trail which gave us great views and we saw several bike riders. Thats all entertainment to a thru hiker. After our second 1000 foot climb of the day we took the side trail to Saunders Shelter. It is one of the nicer shelters we've run across thus far. It is also in a very nice setting with giant pines around it. Our 1st order of business was to get water from the nice pipe a short walk behind the shelter. Then since it was early we spent some time debating staying at this shelter or moving on to the next one. Eventually staying won out. We claimed our spots in the shelter and ate some snacks.  There were already three tents set up when we arrived and they belong to three section hikers. 
As evening came on we ate our supper visited with the section hikers, did some future planning and stayed out of our bags. Later Roadrunner came in, he's a young man from Northern New York doing big miles. He had done a little over 24 miles today. 
Today we hiked 9.5 miles to Saunders Shelter 27,999 steps, low ?? high 84°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Thomas Knob Shelter 18.9 miles.

Sometime this morning the rain started but happily I was sleeping when that happened. We slowly did our morning chores and ate and by the time we were ready to go the rain had stopped.  McDuck was in the lead and we had a big day planned so away we went. The trail was pretty nice this morning with climbs not to tough. Again we spent a good amount of time near creeks and even back to the Creeper Trail and Laurel Fork River.  It is such a beautiful river. Soon we found ourselves on the Creeper Trail as the AT followed it for a mile or so. That was nice. As we were crossing a large wooden bridge all of the sudden McDuck kind of stepped to the side and stopped.  He had spotted a black snake sunning on the bridge railing.  Unfortunately right after that the AT turned left back into the woods and off of the nice Creeper Trail path. 
 
Soon we crossed HWY 58 and thats when the day changed for us. We began our first big climb of the day of 1923 feet. Nice and exhausting. However, with most climbs like that you get a view or two and they were nice ones. One view was from Buzzard Rock and we could see for miles in all directions. Then as we have learned is the AT practice we came down to the parking area at Elk Garden so that our final climb of the day could be even bigger. The final climb was just under 1000 feet but it was full of rocks and roots. My eyes and mind enjoyed playing find a spot to put your foot, but as usual my feet grew weary of the game long before the game was over. 
We are getting close to where tbe ponies can be seen and we saw several piles of pony poo, but no ponies. Hopefully tomorrow. When the shelter came into view it was a welcome sight. We quickly claimed spots on the inside and began working on the evening chores. There are 6 or 7 of us in the shelter tonight, I haven't got many names but we have Good Soup, BriteStar, and her dad Trail Boss.

People started stirring around 7:15 on my level this morning.  I decided to try the upstairs penthouse at this shelter.  It was nice. It reminded me of sleeping on the lower level just with a ladder to climb. We finally got around and by 9am we were on trail. Since we
were staying at mile 499.1 we were excited about finding the 500 mile sign.  It wasn't long and there it was. We took a few pictures, high fived each other and waited on some nice folks to take our picture.  Then off we went and in just a few more steps there was another 500 sign so, we did the picture thing again even getting someone to take our picture again.  Then off we went again and in a few steps we found the next 500 marker. We got to do that four times. So we celebrated 500 miles in a great way. 
Then we were off for real this time and the trail took us over rocky ledges around and thru rocky crags and even through something called a fat man squeeze. Then we rounded a turn and suprise there were ponies. So I quickly got out the apple that had been specifically purchased for the ponies,  sliced it in about 8 peices, offered some to McDuck and JFK, who politely declined, and proceeded on down to share with the ponies.  One was on the trail and very willing to eat a couple of slices.  Then I moved on down and off trail just a bit where a young pony came and ate a slice just before a momma pony came up and encouraged the young one to move on. She proceeded to finish off the rest of the apple and enjoyed getting scratched. We hiked on and a few miles later we saw more ponies this time seeing a momma and her baby. So Cute!

Our hike took us to a place called The Scales which is a fenced in area for horses.  We took a brief snack break and headed off again. It was game day for the eyes, mind and feet again today and I think even the eyes and mind got tired today. We crossed ovet State Route 603 and began our last climb for the day. About 1000 feet and except for a place or two the grade was fairly decent. We rolled into Hurricane Mountain Shelter about 4:45pm. We were happy to find there was room for us in the shelter.  We claimed our spots and began the evening chores.  There is one other guy here tonight Miller Time and we are sharing the shelter with him. 
It was a beautiful day today which started out a little foggy.  The fog would blow through the shelter area this morning and created some beautiful sites. Before we had left the ponies the sun was out and we enjoyed a gorgeous day.
Today we hiked 15.9 miles, 37,531 steps,  low of 44° high 71°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Partnership Shelter which is at mile 534.1 and will make for a 19.1 mile day.

The plan was to get up and on the trail early and we succeeded.  JFK (Jeff from Kansas) was up as the sun just started peaking over the mountains. It was a beautiful sun rise to a beautiful day. We were able to hit the trail by 7:30 and we were expecting rain during the morning but were happy that it held off. The trail was kind to us this morning especially in the rock and root category. Even the elevation changes were nice. We stopped at another lovely water fall this morning. 
At one point today we had just finished a climb and started down the other side when off to my left there was a green valley, on my right tall mountains, the beauty of the valley in front of us,  and blue skies above us, when in my mind popped a song. Have you guessed it yet? Blue skies and rainbows and sunbeams from heaven are what I can see when the Lord is living in me. However, it was the second verse that I was witnessing at the time.  Tall mountains green valleys the beauty that surrounds me all make me aware of the one who's living in me. So I enjoyed walking and singing for a while. Go ahead, you can finish the song.
We had several road crossings today and each time we had high hopes of trail magic. But we had no luck. That didn't slow us down any we just kept on hiking to get to the shelter where we can order pizza.
About 3pm we rolled into Partnership Shelter which is a nice double decker and we claimed spots on the lower level. Then to get pizza you walk over across a parking lot to the Visitor Center where there is a land line to call for pizza. Some of you may have to explain land line to the younger age group. After you place your order you wait about 45 minutes and poof your pizza appears. The three of us ordered 2 large and 1 medium with three liters of Pepsi.  We didn't finish it all off but I ate all but two pieces of mine. We were able to give the rest away to other hungry hikers.. The liter of Pepsi is still a work in progress. Later that evening while we were all in the shelter out of the rain, and by we I mean Rocky,  Papa Smurf, Otis and his human Boxer Mom, Jack, and Caboose, a young man came up offering beer to anyone that wanted one. He asked each one of us if we wanted one. As he came to me I replied no thank you I'm not old enough, and he moved on to get the others theirs.  In a bit he returned and handed out beverages to those that asked for one. Then he reached into his bag and told me he brought me one. Of course some in the shelter tried to make something about that, but I told him thank you but I won't drink it. He happily took it with him, all at a shelter that advertises no alcohol allowed. I'm still trying to finish my liter of Pepsi.

The gang started moving around before 7am this morning but we hung around in the bags just a little longer since we did not need to be in any hurries. We got all of our morning chores done loaded up and headed over to the Visitors Center to see if we could get cell signal and to look for snacks. We found neither. It was warm inside, at least the air temperature was. It wasn't long before we were back outside and headed for the woods.  It was a cool breeze morning and it wasn't long before our 1st climb. 500 feet as JFK would call it a fullback dive, straight up and it was full of rocks. Then in another few miles we did it again, and then again.  My feet were not happy with me at this point in the day. 
Then we happened upon the 1890's farm so we took off our pack and wondered around it for a bit. Back on trail and a few steps later we found the Lindamood School, an old one room school that usually has trail magic in the form of food.  Usually,  but not today. 
As we walked from there we encountered a few farm houses, some nice meadows, crossed over the railroad tracks,  walked on the boardwalk over the swampy area and up to the highway. We parked ourselves in the Sunoco to wait on the wives to pick us up. While waiting I enjoyed a Dr. Enuf, a Poor boy sandwich, a bag of Corn nuts, a Cherry Coke, and Peanut M&M's. While waiting we got to meet a Sobo (South Bounder) trail name Gripper Overcharged.  We wished him well on his final 500 miles. Before long the ladies showed up ready to take three stinky hikers to the hotel.  After checking in I quickly took a nice hot shower and began the unpacking of the pack.  About 6pm we headed out to eat and found a restaurant that had all kinds of Edith Bolling Wilson memorabilia. She was the 2nd wife of Woodrow Wilson the 28th president. Then of course one can't forget the most important meal of the day,  ICE CREAM!
From there it was back to the room to organize for tomorrow, and get some laundry done. I got to FaceTime with my parents and get caught up with their comings and goings,  and got to say congratulations to one of my best long long time friends who became a Grandfather today. 
Today we hiked 12.6 miles 27,737 steps, low 40° high 67°. Tomorrow we are aiming for a slack packing day of around 13 miles. Let's all cheer for a much lighter pack.

The alarm clock woke me from my slumber at 7:00am this morning so that I could get ready for the breakfast spread in the lobby.  We were greeted warmly by the young lady at the desk and she was very helpful with any breakfast items that were out or running low. I  enjoyed two hardboiled eggs, two pancakes, some yogurt, half a bagel and several cups of juice. 
By 9am we were loading up to get taken back to the Sunoco station where we were picked up yesterday.  It was a cool breezy morning as we headed across the parking lot, down the road, under the interstate and back into the woods. It didn't take us long to appreciate how nice it is to get to slack pack.
The trail was really nice today.  Early this morning we had some ups that were steep but not very long and the path was void of the dreaded rocks. We passed Papa Smurf after a couple of miles in this morning and McDuck promised to leave him some trail magic at the road where the wives were doing trail magic. You see, after they dropped us off to start our hike they stopped by a store to get some supplies and then headed to where the AT crossed a road to due trail magic while we hiked. This was the same place we would eventually come out of our hike and then they could take us back to the hotel. When we arrived McDuck made sure to fix Papa Smurf his own sack of trail magic and put it at a spot Papa Smurf is sure to spot it
We enjoyed some beautiful hay meadows and very pretty valleys as we hiked today. However,  the big highlight of the day was the quarter mile tree. Now we have officially hiked a quarter of the trail.  Woo Hoo and Cool Beans! On a slightly less exciting note we also got to hike near a nice stream for a while.  We also got to climb fence stiles as we crossed in and out of private lands. We met a Sobo hiker named Torch that had participated earlier in the day the trail magic the ladies were doing. She was very enthusiastic in her appreciation for what they had done. 
The trail took us by a very old mill site along a very pretty stream and we got to follow the stream for a good while. Then it was over a couple more fence stiles through a meadow or two and down to the road where the trail magic awaited us. I had a couple Gatorades, banana muffins, and Gold Fish crackers. We packed up our gear and food goodies and drove just up the road to the Bear Garden Hiker Hostel.  The owners had been down visiting the ladies and invited them up to see what a hostle was all about. We had a great visit with them and got to tour their place.  
 
Then we loaded up and headed for town. On the way we happened upon a store and stopped in for some ice cream.  You know I've heard somewhere that ice cream is the most important meal of the day.  They had a black raspberry ice cream that was berry good! Yes I  said berry. Back at the hotel we rested, cleaned up, and did chores until time to go eat. We chose the Log House restaurant for tonight and it was tasty. Then it was back to the hotel. It didn't take long for me to get ready for bed cause I was a tired hiker.

No alarm clock to wake us up this morning so I slept till about 8am, now that felt soooooo Gooooood. Back down for the breakfast smorgasbord and witnessed a new thing.  The automatic pancake maker attempting to make 42 pancakes.  It attempted but fell short only because it ran out of pancake batter.  For those of you wondering I was only involved in the watching of this event. 
After breakfast we had a little quiet time while McDuck conducted a little business, then it was off to see the ponies.  JFK had decided to stay in town and skip the ponies so the rest of us headed off in search of the ever mobile ponies. Once we made the twisty turney drive to Grayson Highlands Park area it was just a short half mile hike in to where the ponies were ranging.  We had been tipped off by a couple coming down as we were headed up where they had seen them. Following their directions carefully we soon spied the ponies. There were nine of them and did they ever enjoy our visit. There was one smaller pony that really had our attention and he played things right and was often the center of attention. It was so much fun interacting with them. After that we went on a further hike searching for another gaggle of ponies but never found them.

We did run across a few thru hikers Tire Kicker, Sugar and her human Mamma Bear and a couple of others that I don't remember names for. The park wasn't busy at all which was nice at least for us.
 
Then it was back to the hotel for more resting and strategizing. The next few days are proving to be taxing on the way we normally like to hike. Lots of possible combinations of miles each day and places to stay each night. We just don't happen to like any of the options that much. So, when in a quandary the best thing to do is go eat and think about it. So we did just that. 
After dinner we parked in a Food City parking lot and hashed out a plan. It could be our most daring plan of the hike thus far. You'll have to stay tuned in to find out the details. With our new plan in mind we went in the store and resupplied. Then to celebrate our plan and because its just a good idea we went and got some ice cream.  You know, I've heard somewhere that ice cream is the most important meal of the day. The it was back to the room to get ready for the 1st leg of our plan.

That old alarm clock woke me up again this morning as we had big miles planned.  We were down for breakfast before 7am and out the door for the trail about 7:30am. It was a short drive to the town of Blanton and on to the Brushy Mountain Outpost the start of our adventure today. We start today at mile 591.8 and we ended yesterday at mile 558.5. Those of you doing the math pick up on a problem right away. What happened to those 33.3 miles. They are still there we just haven't done them yet. With our wives here and the ability to slack pack we wanted to take full advantage of that, but in that 33.3 miles there wasn't a safe place for them to pick us up and we ain't ready for a 33 mile day. So, we moved up 33.3 miles and found a section that they could slack pack us. Tomorrow they will take us back to mile 558.5 and we will start on that 33.3 mile section.  I know, I know it sounds convoluted but when McDuck and JFK start making plans things always work out more better. 
This morning the trail was great.  Uphill wasn't to hard downhill wasn't to steep and the tread was very nice. I was walking along and noticed that there wasn't a cloud in the sky, when a song popped into my head.  Guess what song,  come on you know this one, I know you can guess it. Well, OK, it was The Unclouded Day.  Oh, they tell me of a home far beyond the skies.  Oh, they tell me of a home far away.  Oh, they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise. Oh, they tell me of an unclouded day.  Oh, the land of cloudless day.  Oh, the land of an unclouded sky.  Oh, they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise.  Oh, they tell me of an unclouded day. If you'd like you can finish singing the song it's a good one. Anyway I got to sing that song over and over this morning thinking about the land of an unclouded sky.

We stopped at the Jenny Knob Shelter sometime near 1pm for snacks and to fill us up with water and our water bottles up as it was toasty warm today.  There was another hiker there taking a break but I never understood his trail name.  You should check out McDuck's journal cause I bet he knows what it was. I was thinking that today's trail might win best overall trail until we got into the last 4 or so miles.  The rocks came back. The trail said let's play where to put you feet for awhile.  It was just enough to be annoying but not so much that my feet said I quit. The last mile helped to ease the pain as it was downhill and more gooder tread. 
Just as we were crossing the suspension bridge over Kimberling Creek we saw the ladies drive up. That's what you call perfect timing by some amazing Trail Angels. They had been out all day providing trail magic to many hikers we have hiked with. It was neat that they were getting to meet hikers that we had spent time with.  Thank you two wonderful ladies for all you've done this week for the thru hikers and especially for the three of us!
It was a short drive back to town where the vote was unanimous for pizza, now! So, we went to Moon Dog Brick Oven Restaurant and had very good pizza. By the time we got back to the hotel it was 6:30pm, and time for a nice hot shower.  After that it was pack the pack time cause tomorrow is a full pack kind of day as the ladies drop us off and head back home while we go back in the woods. 
Today we hiked 18.4 miles, 42,049 steps, low 64° high 85°. Tomorrow we are aiming for 15 to 18 miles and might have to find a stealth sight.  That is a place not designated as a camping spot but one we would make do with for the night.

That old alarm clock woke me up again this morning as we had a big day planned.  We gathered up any items that we hadn't put away last night and then made our way over for breakfast. It wasn't long after that when McDuck rapped on our door and it was time to load up. Then off we went to find the spot the ladies had been doing their trail magic from cause thats where we will start today. The ladies had decided to walk a short distance with us so away we all went. We all got to say River Crossing just before they sent us off into the forest. Words don't cover how thankful we are to these two ladies for all they did for us and the other hikers. 
We immediately got busy with a long tedious climb. Then the trail mellowed out and was fairly nice. We hiked on until we came to the washed out bridge. There we took off our hiking shoes put on our water shoes and forded our way across. The water was just about ankle deep and felt soooooo Gooooood! After wading across we stopped and refreshed our water and ate some snacks. Then it was hiking shoes back on and back at it. There were a couple more challenging uphill sections but for the biggest part of the morning it was tolerable. 
At some point in the day we came upon a grassy bald and liked the tread on it. As we climbed the bald a wonderful view began appearing to our left and rear. The further up we went the bigger the view until it appeared that we could see forever that direction.  It was a very lovely view. Not long after that we began our search for water. We selected a source that said it would fill a liter in 5 minutes.  That was the best of the choices we had. Well, as it happened we would have been thrilled if it had been that fast. We could get about a cup every 5 minutes. JFK used his scoop in some of the little pools of water and filled his bag. McDuck was able to get a full liter the same way.  They were both kind and shared with me or we might still be there waiting. 
Not long after that we made it to Chestnut Knob Shelter.  From this shelter you can see a big portion of the Burkes Garden.  It is a area 8 miles by 4 miles that was formed by a limestone sinkhole.  It is a beautiful valley all decked out in green. Then the real work began.  When we went up it was straight and tough.  Then the rocks began. It didn't take long before I was worn out and we still had miles to go. My left foot had started smarting and I thought I was getting a blister so when we came to a road JFK and McDuck graciously let me off the hook and found the Burkes Garden Hostel that would come pick us up and we could stay there. 
Now I've had a hot shower,  eaten my supper and I'm not far from bed time. 
Today we hiked 17.6 miles, 43,233 steps,  low 57° high 77°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Brushy Mountain Outpost 15.8 miles.

No alarm clock for me this morning as we could sleep in if we wanted.  Thunderstorms moved in early this morning and were still rumbling when I smelled waffles cooking downstairs. So, I grabbed my water bottle and headed down to see when it might be my turn to cook some. Lucky me I only had to wait for Miller Time to finish his. Breakfast consisted of 4 waffles and water. 
Next it was get myself organized for departure as we had set 10 am as the time to get shuttled back to the trail. When that time came we loaded up along with a hiker named Grit and back to County Road 623 we went.  We were dropped off said our so longs and into the woods we went.  We hiked along the ridge above Burkes Garden and just like yesterday there were lots of rocks to negotiate. Then came a long downhill to Jenkins Shelter and right after that a pretty creek called Hunting Camp.  Then we climbed fairly steep till we reached about 3200 feet and then had a nice long hike much of it virtually flat. SWEET! From there the trail was kind to us as the ups and downs were not bad at all. Now during all of that two big things happened.  Number one was hitting 600 miles! It is still hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that we have hiked that far. Number two, thanks to McDuck's sharp eyes we have now seen a Red EFT. Hopefully there is a picture included.  I  saw ""a"" Red EFT, some claim as many as seven were seen. 
 
As we got close to our end spot we called the Weary Feet Hostel that we had made reservations with early in the day and they sent a shuttle driver to pick us up. At the shelter we were fed all the spaghetti you could eat, along with salad, bread and dessert. Wow, did she fix big plates of spaghetti. Then we claimed spots in the bunkhouse, took showers and worked on our evening chores. 
Today we hiked 15.8 miles,  36,549 steps, low 48° high 57°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Woods Hole Hostel 15.3 miles.

We were up after a very restless night.  One of our bunk mates snores aggressively.  He snored so loud that one guy gathered up all of his stuff and slept out on the front porch. It was annoying at best. They called for breakfast just before 7:30 am so we all went over to the main house for scrambled eggs  sausage patties, pancakes, fruit and Tang. It was very good. After breakfast we settled up with the hostel and got packed up to go. We were just a short walk to the start of the trail and had started walking when Robert the shuttle driver stopped and gave us a ride. Julie and Robert were great hosts. 
Into the woods we went and the trail was excellent. Good footing and not much elevation change. We took a side trail about two miles in to see Dismal falls.  Not the biggest that we've seen but it was a nice spot for camping and swimming. The trail continued to be kind to us all morning and we walked most of the time very near one creek or another.  I sure enjoyed hearing the water sounds as we hiked. Around noon we stopped at Wapiti Shelter for a snack break and refill on water. 
Then the trail changed. We soon were deep into a steep climb with a rocky trail.  When that was over we started hitting rocky patches.  This trend continued until we hit the road to the hostel.  Sure glad that section is over.
We walked the half mile down to the hostel and were greeted as soon as we walked up the drive. We got the low down on the place, signed up for dinner and breakfast and a loaf of bread and chunk of cheddar cheese to take with me as I go. Yum! Yum! Next on the order of business was to pick a bunk in the bunkhouse get your stuff out and organized. Then I headed over to the shower house and found me some loaner clothes and get a shower.  Ahhhh,  clean again. Then about 6pm the dinner bell sounded and we all got to gather in a circle in the yard and tell our trail name, where we're from, and what we're thankful for. Some clown said he was thankful for butter.  No it wasn't me! We had pumpkin lasagna, blackeyed Peas, salad, homemade bread, and a cookie, and it was so good I had to have seconds. The the lady that runs the place told us much of the history and story that goes with the hostel. Now its hiker midnight and time for bed.
Today we hiked 15.3 miles, 37,635 steps, low 42° high 57°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Angels Rest Hiker Haven off of mile 637, about 11.5 miles. It might even count as a Nero.

Up this morning about 7:15am after a good night's rest. We weren't sure how good sleep was going to be since the guy who was so successful snoring the previous night showed up in the bunkhouse just before supper time last night.  If he snored last night I never heard him. I started getting my stuff organized and changing the sheet and pillowcase as per the rules when the breakfast bell rang.  We all gathered around inside this morning since it was about 30°. We each got to tell who we were, where we were from and what we were thankful for. Then we were treated to oatmeal with several unique toppings,  I think it was a broccoli and egg casserole of some kind, peach crisp, fruit and orange juice. 
After breakfast we settled our account and headed over to finish getting ready to hike. Once ready I dropped by the main house to pick up my warm loaf of bread and my block of cheese. Before we left the yard me and the dog had finished my loaf of bread.  I was doing a great job eating the bread when we started visiting with one of the workers and while visiting I let my hand with the bread in it drop to my side. Next thing I knew I had a dog on the end of my bread. From there I shared small bites of bread with the dog as we started walking up the road back to the trail. 
Back in the woods we were back on a rocky trail. Early in the hike we came upon our first view of the day. While there we also had some deer nearly walk up to us. As the day went on we had 3 or 4 more excellent views.  Our last view for the day was from Angel's Rest Rock which is at 3506 feet. I took a picture from there of Pearisburg which was over 1800 feet below us. And that ment we had an 1800 foot decline ahead of us. It started out steep but not long after it mellowed out and we started seeing lots of pretty flowers.  Much like a wild flower park.
 
We hiked on to the pickup road and called for a shuttle to take us to the Hiker Haven.  After checking in and getting the tour we had to hang out until our rooms were ready.  We then made our plan for the next few days which includes a couple of slack pack days. Woo Hoo! 
Next we walked about a mile to a Mexican restaurant for supper. Food was good and portions were nice. From there we made it to the Food Lyon for our resupply.  We saw several other hikers out eating or resuppling and a few of them will also be slack packing tomorrow. We headed back to the Hiker Haven and got ourselves as ready as we could for in the morning. 
Today we hiked 11.5 miles, 30,072 steps,  low 36° high 51°. Tomorrow we are aiming for a 20 mile slack pack and will end up back at the Hiker Haven for another night.

Up early this morning at 6am. We had to get ourselves packed up and out of our rooms,  eat, and be out front by 7 am to be taken to our beginning point at mile 657. You see, today we will be slack packing, which we've done before,  but this time we will walk south bound.  They drove the three of us and three ladie section hikers out to mile 657 and we walked back to Pearisburg.  The three ladies are Slow Train, Five Star and Siri.  We met these ladies at Wood's Hole Hostel and they are a pleasure to be around. Late update, we just saw the three ladies and they made it back safe and sound.  Way to go ladies!
Mike, the shuttle driver dropped us off and away we went.  We hike faster than the ladies so very soon we were on our own. There was a big climb to start off the day but the trail made it fairly easy.  We were told we should see free range goats as we hiked and we looked carefully for them but didn't see a one. I did see several chipmunks, a couple of squirrels and lots of birds. 
After several hours of hiking we came to a meadow similar to a bald and there was a georgous view so we stopped and had snacks and a brief break. Back hiking we walked in and out of the rocks until we reached Rice Field Shelter which had another fabulous view. Along the whole hike today we were looking forward to who we might see hiking north bound. I don't remember the exact count but we saw about 30 north bound hikers and about 10 of them we knew.
 
 
Part of the hike today had us walking alongside the highway in Pearisburg where we crossed over the New River.  Around 4:30pm we rolled back into the Angels Rest Hiker Haven.  We spent several minutes getting our slack pack arranged for tomorrow. Then JFK and I set up our tents and McDuck settled into the bunkhouse. Then it was off in search of food.  We settled on the DQ and ate burgers and ice cream until we were full.  You know I've heard somewhere that ice cream is the most important meal of the day. Next it was to the service station next door in search of Corn Nuts and this time we were successful. Back at the Hiker Haven I showered changed into sleeping clothes and worked on this journal.  By 7:30pm my eyes were having trouble staying open
Today we hiked 20 miles, 48,057 steps, low 31° high 61°. Tomorrow we are aiming for another 20 mile slack packing and will be brought back to Angels Rest when we finish.

Up this morning at 6am to get ready for another big slack packing day. Before we go there though let's revisit last night.  JFK and I were tenting on the Angels Rest property.  We set up our tents, got our showers, and I got in my tent around 7:30pm and by 8:30 I was asleep.  Somewhere around 3:45am a siren went off that sounded like a tornado siren.  Quite disturbing and made it a challenge to get back to sleep.  Why it went off is still a mystery to me. 
Back to getting ready this morning we had our extra stuff bagged and on the office porch just before 7am and our stuff loaded into the shuttle and away we went.  By 7:30am we were on trail. Soon we were into our first climb which wasn't to bad. Two or three times today I enjoyed walking next to a stream or creek. There's just something soothing about hearing the water sounds. We had been warned that there were sections of rocks which we found to be true several times today. We saw a sign pointing to a view spot and we took the trail to Wind Rock. It was one of those magical view spots where you felt as if you were on top of the world and could see most of it from there. Cool Beans!We stopped at War Spur Shelter around 1pm for our snack time. Grit was there finishing his lunch as we arrived, Grit is a hiker we met at Burks Garden Hostel and have been around him a couple of times since. He is such a friendly individual. After snacks we refilled our water bottles and off we went. 
Next it was the climb up Kelly Knob.  It was a bugger. Up and up and up we went on a rocky trail.  The view from there just wasn't that spectacular. From there it was mostly downhill to our waiting shuttle.  Right at the end of the trail we walked through some nice meadows with good views.  Mike was waiting as we rolled in and again he brought us cold drinks to refresh us after a long day. So nice.
Back to Angels Rest to gather up the rest of our stuff and to settle up with Hot Tamale who runs the place. Then Mike brought us up to the Plaza Hotel where we have rooms for tonight. In the morning Mike will pick us back up and take us back to VA 42 where he picked us up this afternoon. This hotel we're in is an old but clean hotel and the lady that runs the place is very sweet and accommodating. Once we got in our rooms I got stuff out of my bags so it could dry worked on the journal, got a shower and was ready for bed.
Today we hiked 20.7 miles, 51,385 steps, low 34° high 64°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Nida Shelter a 10.1 mile day.

Oh how nice it was to sleep in a little bit this morning. I didn't get out of bed until 7:30am and then it was just to hang out my tent on the porch rail to dry, and then back to the bed. McDuck and I decided to go to Hardee's for a breakfast sandwich and we invited JFK to join us. He declined because he wanted to go to the Post Office instead. Food was good and it was quick which got us back to the hotel to finish packing up and to be ready for Mountain Mike. He arrived a little early so we loaded up and away we went.  Not long after we were back in the woods. Shortly after that we came upon our first cool thing of the day, The Keffer Oak. It is billed as the largest oak in the south along the AT.  It was definitely a very large tree. Then as we continued our hike we came to Bruisers Knob Cairns. Someone has stacked up the rocks into really big cairns. There were several of them and it is amazing how much effort it would take to build them.
Next on the list of cool things for today was these rock ledges. Huge rock slabs slanted towards the ledges with terrific views.  These ledges went on for quite some time along with the views. And they were spectacular views! Then as we continued on we came to the Eastern Continental Divide where the water on one side flows to the Gulf of Mexico and on the other side to the Atlantic Ocean. From there it was just a few more miles to our home for the night, Niday Shelter. Once there we had a lengthy discussion on should we go on and cross the creek with the missing bridge tonight or wait till tomorrow. The unknown issue was when and how much rain we would get. We made the decision to stay hoping that the rain will be light enough that we can get safely across the creek. Only time will tell. 
 
We then picked out spots in the shelter and got busy with evening chores.  Shortly after that a young man named Maps arrived and joined us in the shelter.  Then later Girl Scout showed up and now we have five. Lots of fun conversation tonight about lots of different subjects.  Interesting note is that the rain we thought was coming so far keeps missing us. That's good news for fording a stream. 
Today we hiked 10.1 miles, 28,224 steps, low 57° high 64°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Four Pines Hostel 16.7 miles as long as we can ford the creek.

The sound of rain on the roof last night seemed to help us sleep.  We all felt like it was a good night for us. I woke up twice and both times it was raining pretty steady.  By 7am when I was waking up there was still a very light rain and I could hear discussions of the rain ending soon, so I started the morning process. The topic of discussion as we did our morning chores was how high was the creek we needed to ford this morning. The bridge that used to be across the creek was damaged in a previous flood and on or about the 25th of this month that bridge was removed from the creek entirely. That's why we needed to ford the creek. They claim that normally it's about ankle deep.  We pondered did we get enough rain to make it difficult to cross, after all it seemed to rain all night. 
Well, eventually we left mostly as a group to hike the mile plus to find our answer.  As we hiked and began seeing the small creeks flowing full of water we began surmise that the main creek is going to be rolling.  Sure enough as we arrived it was obvious that the nice creek we had planned to ford was now raging and well out of its banks. So we made a good decision and chose the AT approved walk around, so that no one drowned. The walk around involved 4.5 miles of nice road walking. Interesting side note is that the AT approved walk around saved us a couple of regular miles making it an even more gooder decision.

Once the road walk was completed we once again entered the woods with a nice up hill climb. When we had finished the 800 or so foot climb we were at the start of what they called the ledges. This was about a 4 mile walk right on the edge of the mountain.  There were some nice views, at least as nice as we could see on a somewhat cloudy misty kind of day. I did stop several times just to look at the view and say WOW! There were more pretty flowers to be seen along the way and McDuck has a secret source for identifying them all. Of course McDuck spotted more of the Red EFT's today. I haven't figured out how to spot them yet. Thankfully he points them out as we go. We also stopped today at mile marker 700. Yes we have now completed 700 AT miles. Woo Hoo!
 

 
At the end of the above mentioned 4 miles is a rock formation called Dragon's Tooth. It's another of the iconic places on the AT and I was excited to finally be there in person.  Hopefully there will be a picture of it here.
 
Then from there it was a wicked hike down to the road. It was a rock scramble at times putting your hiking poles aside so you could use both hands to climb down kind of deal. Very challenging and at times lots of fun. 
By the end of the day my right shin was on fire and the decision was made for us to get off trail for a couple of days to let it heal.  Another good decision for us today.  We called Sprocket a shuttle driver to take us to a hotel in Salem VA. where I will rest and ice a shin till it feels better.  Once we checked in it was shower time and the off in search of more town food.  JFK found us another good place to eat tonight.  He sure has a nack for finding good food, which is just another one of his adorable qualities. Then it was back to the hotel and foot up ice on.
Today we hiked officially 16.7 miles, 36,066 steps, low 54° high 62°. Tomorrow we are aiming for a zero and resting my shin.

How lovely zero mornings can be. With no expectations on where I had to be this morning I slept in till 8am. Ahhhhhhhh. Then we went downstairs for our gourmet hotel breakfast.  I enjoyed waffles, scrambled eggs, yogurt, and several glasses of juice.  Then it was back to the room where I've kept my foot up and iced regularly.  McDuck kept busy doing all of our laundry and JFK was diligently working on acquiring us transportation for the next day or two. Where would one find two better friends?
About 1pm we headed out to find the local Outfitters and then to lunch at the Red Robin. Sure was a good burger.  After that we found Walmart to do some resupply. As usual it seems I have more than I need for the next 3 days hiking.  Back at the hotel I got off my feet put ice on the shin and enjoyed the rest time. 
Somewhere around 8pm we decided we needed more food and especially ice cream. So out we went.  It was Chick fil a then a short drive to the nearest DQ for another Choc O Strawberry Blizzard.  Yum Yum. You know I've heard somewhere that ice cream is the most important meal of the day. By this time I'm ready for bed time. But first,  one more ice session for the leg. It was a very relaxing zero kind of day.

It was about 8:15am when I started stirring this morning. Sure was nice. We got ourselves around and raced down for the morning breakfast. Once again I partook of the varied offerings except the yogurt.  The only flavor available was vanilla so I passed. 
Next JFK drove McDuck and I to the Westside Church of Christ where we were warmly greeted by many of their members and were able to participate in worship.  Afterwards one of the members, a section hiker trail name Coach, extended us trail magic by taking us to lunch and driving us back to the hotel.  We enjoyed discussing the many facets of the trail with Coach and his kindness and concern for two complete strangers was humbling.  Thank you very much Coach for being an excellent trail Angel and best wishes on your upcoming hike in Pennsylvania. 
Coach dropped us of at the hotel and up went the foot and on went the ice. I've gotta get this shin ready for a short hike tomorrow. We spent the afternoon at rest and around 5pm we discussed where to eat. The Texas Roadhouse won the discussion and soon we were on our way. At dinner we made our plan for getting back in the woods tomorrow.  We return the rental car and get picked up around 10am and that should put us in the woods by 10:30. 
Tonight more of the foot up with ice and getting pack more organized. Looking forward to getting back to our hike.  I've read for years how people who have spent a day or two in town begin to miss being in the woods, and as much as I've enjoyed the time in town I can feel the pull of the woods, calling me back to hiking.

Congratulations to everyone, high fives all around.  We have completed two full months on trail.  Lots of miles, views, laughter, great people, neat experiences, laughter, have I said laughter yet and more. I'm so thankful that each of you have been following us and encouraging us along this journey.  It is amazing, it can be difficult, but it has exceeded my expectations and we're only 712.5 miles in. Hope we all can stick around for the finish at Katahdin. 
We were off to our hotel breakfast about 8am this morning where I enjoyed my usual as well as strawberry yogurt. Back in the room we put the finishing touches on our packs and were in the car headed for the rental place by 9:30am. JFK expertly handled the check-in of the rental and then we waited a few minutes on Sprocket our shuttle driver.  He arrived just before ten and then zoom we went down the highway and to the trailhead.
Off we went into the woods and soon were walking through very narrow switchback gates and into pasture land. We said hello to the cows and you'd a thought we were aliens by the way they stared at us. Back through another one of those gates and we were walking along a really nice creek.  Always a pleasure to do that. On we walked and came to some cliffs that you could still just make out a view, and a little further up were some rock outcroppings with a view. Shortly after that we stopped at John Springs shelter for a break and snacks.  Then it was one more mile to our home for the night, Catawba Shelter.  We got places in the shelter and slowly began to take car of evening chores. 
It was an early afternoon and very cool so we couldn't help but laugh at each other for eating supper around 4:30 and some of us in our bags by 5pm. I'm sure some of you are asking how's the shin? It is not as good as I hoped it would be but not as bad as this past Friday. Another challenge along this journey. Tonight we have met K, and Mad Dog a couple of Nobo's and got to eat our early supper with a friendly group of section hikers. As I'm writing one in our group is already snoring.  It may be an early morning wake up call.

For an old boy who was in his sleeping bag by around 6:30 pm last night he sure slept in this morning.  I didn't start moving till about 7:15am. Several of the group from last night and two new ones, Deliberate and Trouble had surrounded the picnic table out front of the shelter so even if you weren't through sleeping you were through sleeping. We got up and got started on those morning chores. 
Around 8:30 I headed on out since I'm moving slower than the other two towards our first big thing for today,  McAfee Knob. This is one of the places more pictures are taken on the Appalachian Trail.  It wasn't long till McDuck and JFK caught up with me and then not much longer to reach McAfee. It was everything and more than I had imagined.  I have seen pictures and videos for the last 10 years and none of them even begins to compare to how big and marvelous the views are. Spectacular,  awesome, beautiful, inspiring, uplifting and all the other words that kept coming into my mind. We took several pictures and I even sat on the point of the knob for the iconic picture. 
Well, after we had absorbed as much as we could and helped a few others with pictures we reluctantly moved on. Soon we were approaching the ledges.  As we were nearing them we began to start avoiding large cow pies on or very near the trail.  As we were climbing a steep section fresh pies appeared as well as fresh tracks so, I looked up to see three cows walking the trail.  Soon two more appeared and we followed them up the trail. Near the top they started moving off the trail so we could pass on by without incident. 
Then came Tinker Cliffs.  Another long set of rock outcroppings that you could stop at and enjoy the view.  Again we couldn't help ourselves we just kept on stopping and kept on marveling at the views. Pictures were taken again but they just can't compare to the real thing.  Stupendous!
Again, reluctantly we moved on and as we worked our way down we passed Tied-dyed Goat, and her daughter Sunflower along with their support Ground Control. Mother and daughter are attempting a thru hike and dad was along for a day hike. We had a nice visit and very likely will see them again. Then we rolled into Lamberts Meadow Shelter around 1:45pm and claimed a spot in the shelter.  The shelter is a little rough looking but it is in a great setting with a creek out front just a bit with another new picnic table. 
About five I moved from my spot on a stump in the sun to another stump closer to the picnic table.  It was supper time but I wanted to stay in the sunshine,  it felt good. We ate and visited a bit with others eating then about 6pm I crawled up put my foot up and worked on this journal some. Two guys, Bookmark and Ranch have joined us tonight in the shelter.

It was one of those restless kind of nights for me. Didn't seem to matter which direction I tried some part of me or another didn't like it. So, when the bird wake up alarm went off this morning all I could do was laugh. It was the same bird alarm we had a couple of weeks ago. It's amazing how loud that bird is. With all of that I didn't get out of my bag until about 7:30am and we were on trail by around 8:30am. 
It was a cool spitting rain kind of morning as we headed up the trail and at the top of the first climb we could see it was sleeting and spitting snow pellets. We checked our thermometers and it had dropped to 37°. It didn't last very long but was entertaining for early May. There were a couple of great views at this point in the hike and we enjoyed them. We continued on and came upon a couple of humongous rock formations one of which is called the Hay Rock.  If I'm any good there will be a picture of it now.
On the other side of the ridge we were following is the Carvins Cove Reservoir.  We walked around it high up on the ridge which gave us some great views also. Soon we walked under the buzzing powerlines and had another view of the valley. From there it was a fairly nice downhill walk to Daleville VA. As we came out of the woods you could see the Super 8, our home for the night.  We checked in and soon we were headed out to eat. We had been told of a place called Angelle's Diner that served fabulous hamburgers so we tried it. They were very good.  Back to the room it was wash clothes time and shower time. We worked on a plan for the next day or two and me and JFK found some Permethrin in the hiker box and re-sprayed some of our clothes. Then it was food time again.  We walked over to Ponchos for a Mexican dinner. While there we got to see my first robotic server. It brought JFK his soft tacos. Pretty fancy. After that it was back to the room and finish my journal and to sleep I shall go.
Today we hiked 9.4 miles, 21,280 steps,  low 37° high 51°. Tomorrow we are aiming for a slack pack to Taylor Mountain Overlook about 14 miles.

Up around 7am this morning after a really good night's rest. We headed down for the gourmet breakfast to find it lacking.  I ate several breakfast type fruit bars some mini white doughnuts and several cups of juice. Back to the room we put the finishing touches on our bags and filled our water bottles and away we went into the woods. 
The first part of the trail was along the highway in Daleville, yet still in the woods.  The hiking club in this area keeps it groomed nicely.  Finally the trail spit us out onto a road and we walked under the highway and back in the woods. It was sorta odd to feel like you were isolated in the woods yet you could hear road noise and regularly see homes. At some point as we walked on McDuck said, you don't hear road noise anymore, and just like that we were really in the woods again. 
We had several good climbs today but the trail was kind to us and the grade of assent was very doable. We saw and enjoyed seeing several kinds of flowers as we hiked through the day, especially the Rhododendron. They are beginning to bloom in ernest and are very beautiful. We also spent a little time hiking near those babbling brooks that I love so much. 
Early in the day we celebrated completing one third of the miles.  There was an official sign placed by the AT Conservancy as well as the official 732.8 spelled out in rocks. A mild celebration was held at both locations. 
 
 
About 10 miles into the day we stopped for a short snack break at the Wilson Shelter before taking off for the last miles of the day. There was more of the climbing that was of a decent grade and soon we could hear and then see the cars on the Blue Ridge Parkway. As I recall we will hike near the Parkway for many miles. It wasn't long until we reached Taylor Mountain Overlook our pickup spot for today. Our shuttle drivers name is Homer and he and his family hiked the AT twenty or so years ago. They made a little book of their story told from the point of view of his daughter.  
 
I want to thank all of you prayer warriors out there praying for our safety and the healing of my shin. Prayer works, we are safe and my shin is doing better day by day. Please keep those prayers coming!About 6pm we went in search of more food.  We found a BBQ place called Three Little Pigs and went in to see what they offered.  You might find this surprising but they served pig in this place.  As usual the food was good.  Then we had to do one of the most scary things us hikers do and that's resupply.  I really think I might maybe done did better at it this time, perhaps. Back to the hotel I got cleaned up did a little organizing and am ready for bed.
Today we hiked 14.4 miles, 35,350 steps, low 48° high 53°. Tomorrow we are aiming for a Sobo hike from Jennings Creek VA Route 614 at mile 758.5 to Taylor Mountain Overlook 744.7, 13.8 miles.

It was 7:30 before I got out of bed this morning.  No need to be in a hurry as our shuttle wasn't scheduled until 9am. Back down to our extensive breakfast again this morning but I went out on a limb and traded the strawberry yogurt for peach. I know, very scary move on my part, but as it turned out it was a good trade.
By 8:45am we were in the lobby ready for the shuttle.  Right about 9am JFK gets a call saying our shuttle is running late. His reply was no problem, see you when you get here. Around 9:20am we were on our way to the woods.  Just before 10am we started climbing right next to Jennings Creek.  It was a big climb and I'm thankful I had on a very light pack. Today's hike was another awesome hike.  The trail was mostly good with a couple of strenuous climbs and a few places of rocks.  But mostly it was great. Amazing views, abundant beautiful flowers, and sunshine and blue skies. That combination makes for a great hiking day. I found myself in a bind several times not knowing whether to look at the view, the flowers or the trail. Most of the time the trail won out so that I could stay upright and catch the views and flowers later.
 
We saw an abundant amount of hikers today most I didn't know.  There were two groups of lady day hikers and I had nice visits with them.  In the second group there was one lady that had graduated from OU and thought it was cool to meet a thru hiker from Oklahoma so she asked if she could get a picture with me. 
Our first stop of the day was when we crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway for the first time.  As we were snacking and refilling our water several bicyclists were coming by. I  never heard what the event was but we saw them a couple more times today.  With snacks in our bellies and a full load of water the trail decided to take us uphill again. We were again treated to fantastic views and many many gorgeous flowers. McDuck's source for identifying flowers had previously helped us with the Spiderwart flower, a very lovely purple or pink flower.  Today when I saw a group of 3 or 4 of them together I had to take a picture because normally they come just one at a time. I barely had the phone back in its pocket when we had walked into a field of them.  Absolutely beautiful!  As we continued walking we crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway probably 3 more times, each time with views of different valleys or different mountains. Then before we knew it we were walking back up to Taylor Mountain Overlook our pickup spot for today. 
While waiting for Homer to pick us up I had the opportunity to visit by phone with my parents, Big O and Iron Pants.  Good to her from them. Homer arrived and loaded us up to take us back to the Super 8. However, we was hungry hikers and persuaded him to take us to Angelle's Diner where we dined. Then JFK arrange an Uber back to the hotel. McDuck and I dropped our stuff in the room and headed over to the quick stop to finish out our resupply and get some snacks for this evening. Then it was rest and recovery time.

We were up at 7:15am this morning eager to get dressed and down for that delicious and nutritious Super 8 breakfast.  Little did I know but while eating breakfast I got to watch part of the King crowning. It was difficult for McDuck to pull me away but he managed. Back in the room we finished packing up and headed down to the lobby to wait on our shuttle. Soon Teresa showed up and off we went to Jennings Creek our starting place for today. 
By about 9am we were in the woods, and again it was uphill. Our first climb of the day was just over 1000 feet and much of it was tough sledding. Then the trail was mostly kind to us till we reached Bryant Ridge Shelter. Then it was our second big climb of over 2200 feet. It was another long steep climb. Then we stopped at a stream about eight miles in for a snack break and to camel up on water. Then you can guess what was next, more uphill. Another 1300 foot climb awaited us.  During this climb we saw the view from Black Rock, the FFA Long Range air control tower, we got to walk through and survive the guillotine, cross over the Blue Ridge Parkway and make it to our shelter. Much climbing and much to see.
There was one event today that for me was spectacular.  It wasn't long after we left Bryant Ridge Shelter McDuck had caught up with me and we were headed uphill.  My head was down observing the trail and the flowers growing near it when ol eagle eyes McDuck said hey hold on look at this and what did my wandering eyes behold but the elusive, the rare Lesser Known Yellow Lady Slipper! I have heard that the odds of seeing one is 119 to one. The picture up top is of the beautiful flower. 
Once at the shelter we claimed our spots and began the afternoon chores. Wilin, a fellow hiker is here tenting along with Silva, Cherry and Operator. Sharing the shelter with us is Aleron.

We were up early as a couple of our shelter mates were stirring early so by 6:45 I was getting around and by 7:45am I was on the trail.  It was another beautiful morning and I was looking forward to the hike. It was only a short hike to our first view at Thunderhill Ridge Overlook.  You could see forever it seemed. There were several views throughout the day and several places you almost had a good view.  It kept my head on a swivel thats for sure. 
At some point in the hike McDuck spotted not one, not two but four Lesser Known Yellow Lady Slippers. And to make matters more complicated a short distance latter he spotted a bunch more.  Now if the odds were 119 to 1 that I would see one,  what are the odds that I would see that many in one day. I'm sure it's astronomical! Not only did we see the Lady Slippers we saw Trillium by the millium.  Fields and fields of them. 
 
 
We stopped for our snack and water refill  about noon at a nice little creek which left us about 4.5 five miles left for the day. We needed to hustle a little bit on this section to try and beat the rain that was coming and as we were crossing the James River foot bridg the rain started and by the time we got in the shuttle it was pouring. There were a bunch of youngsters hanging out on the bridge getting up the courage to jump off the bridge into the river.  If I was just 40 years younger I would have joined them.
We ended up at Stanimals Hostel, McDuck in a bunk, JFK on a couch and I'm on the floor. They have people stacked everywhere. Ought to be an interesting night. Once we sorta knew where we would be we got a ride to Scotto's the one and only restaurant in town.  Food was good and we got the low down on where to go and what to and not to do. After eating we walked across the highway to a store that had a large variety of stuff including hiker resupply.  We got some snacks as we plan to slack pack again tomorrow. 
 
Back to the hostel I got my cubby hole set up, found some loaner clothes and got in line for the shower. McDuck started some laundry so I added to it. Then they rang the dinner bell and I automatically got in line. We had kielbasa hot dogs and salad.  Yum yum! After dinner we had time to work on journals and visit with a house full of people. Oh, by the way I finally got in the shower. I smell clean, woo woo woo.

What an interesting night it was. The small house had at least 20 people inside and several more outside in their tents. I was on the floor in the living room and there were five other people and one small dog sharing the room. At one point I was surprised by the small dog deciding to sleep with me and as the night went along she (the dog) would just snuggle right up with me. Needless to say with all of the noises and people getting up and down it was a restless night. 
And then at 4:58am the kitchen light came on and the place slowly started coming alive. I  got busy putting my stuff away and getting my pack ready when it became obvious that pancakes were ready to eat. I sat myself right down and had eight blueberry pancakes, while keeping myself in line for the one yes I said one bathroom. We obviously enjoyed this experience because we are back again tonight. The house is just as full as last night, the big difference for me is I'm in a lower bunk tonight. Score!
So enough about the hostel,  how was the hike today? I'm so glad you asked.  We, McDuck, JFK and me were setting outside waiting on a shuttle to take us to the foot bridge so we could begin our 18 mile north bound slack pack. When we finally loaded into the car we were being driven several miles away so we could do a 22 mile south bound slack pack. I spent much of my hiking day trying to figure out how that happened to me. Oh well, we hit the trail around 8:15am and for the next four miles or so we had a lovely hike alongside a beautiful babbling brook and when the brook ended we hiked around the Lynchburg Reservoir. Next we crossed the river on a fun suspension bridge and then the work began. We had a climb from about 1000 feet to 2200 feet and shortly thereafter up to 3300 feet. Exhilarating! At the top of Bluff Mountain there were great views and a brief break. We continued on and found some nice views at an area called the Cliffs.  You could see the James River and the valley it is in from the Cliffs. The big news of the day was crossing the 800 mile mark! Celebrations all around. It is amazing how fast those miles are passing by. I didn't count the number of hikers we saw today but I think we saw about 10 we knew.
Then other than a short climb here or there it was a long long downhill back to the James River parking lot where we would get picked up. Our shuttle was there waiting as we arrived. They husseled us back to the hostel where JFK and I had just enough time to shower before being wisked away to the church for an all you can eat spaghetti type dinner.  The folks there were super nice and friendly and the food was good. We each got to tell who we were, trail name, where we were from and anything else we wanted to share. 
After dinner several of us rode in the back of a pickup to the hostel.  McDuck finally got his shower and then he did laundry for all of us. We worked on our plan for the next few days, settled our accounts with the hostel and organized bags and bunk spaces so we could get to bed.

I couldn't believe it when I woke up this morning, but it was a decent night's sleep. The guy above me tried to snore big time but when he would get started I would shake the bunk and he would wiggle for a bit but stopped snoring. And to make things even more surprising the first time I looked at my watch it was 6:10am and not 5am like I guessed. That's not how I thought the night would go. Shame on me for thinking otherwise. 
 
So,, I got up got dressed and yes I had eight more blueberry pancakes.  Yum yum. Then it was get the bed stripped and get myself ready to go. Soon we caught a ride to the store and resupplied for the next three or so days of hiking. We were walking back to the hostel after shopping and this real nice guy asked if we wanted a ride, absolutely we did. So, without sticking out a thumb we hitched a ride. When we got back to the hostel we were warmly greeted by Trouble and Deliberate two hikers we had met near McAfee Knob. She, Deliberate, said its JFK' and his group.  All McDuck and I could do was shrug our shoulders and smile.  We had been called the Treo, the Three Amegos, and now we are JFK's Group. Now that JFK's Group was back at the hostel we sorted and packed up our food purchases finished packing our packs and sat around waiting for our turn to be shuttled back to the trail. 
Our turn came and by 10:15am we were back in the woods. For the next hour we hiked about 2.4 miles up a 2000 foot climb. What a fantastic way to start your day. The rest of the day I felt leg tired from that first climb. However at the top was a bald of sorts and we enjoyed some wonderful views. There were several places you could see views off to your left and then the next one might be off to your right. As we hiked we passed several hikers including Shades and her guide dog Blaze, K2, Blackbeard and Serendipity. Around 3:45pm we rolled into the shelter happy to have beat the rain. We claimed our spots in the shelter and then I made my way down to the creek for water. Cool clear water.
There was a gentleman already at the shelter  who has a home on Lake Tenkiller, it's a small world for sure. K2 wandered in and we all visited while we ate dinner. We were just about finished when Freijy came down the path. Last we had heard she was off trail in New Mexico. She said yes she was,  but was now headed for Damascus and trail days. It somehow didn't surprise us that our paths would cross again. 
It is closing in on 7:30pm now time for all good, worn out, and sleepy hikers to crawl into their bags.

Another good night's sleep was had and I awoke, way to early, to a beautiful day. The group was stirring and morning chores had begun. I got busy with mine and by 7:30am I had finished and was heading up the trail. 
As I've mentioned it was a beautiful day. Full sunshine with the morning starting off in the upper 40's. The first couple of miles this morning were very nice. We walked mostly in the forrest meadow and enjoyed the lush greens and pretty flowers. We heard lots of different kinds of birds today as the forest is really coming alive. Then came the first climb up to Spy Rock a fantastic view spot. We enjoyed the 360° views on an absolutely perfect morning. We continued on from there and for awhile we added another person to JFK's Group.  K hopped in with us for a few miles and we got to learn a little about him.
We hiked a few tame ups and downs until we came to VA 826. There K decided to take a break and The Group headed up the Priest Mountain to the Priest Shelter. It is AT tradition at the Priest Shelter to confess something and to write that confession in the shelter log book. So we stopped by for a break and some water and to read several of the confessions. Very entertaining. If you want to know what we wrote you'll have to hike up to the shelter.
Then for the next four miles we came down 3000 feet, and for an old boy with a bad shin that was too much downhill. From there it was a nice two and a half mile journey up 1000 feet to our home for the night, Harper's Creek Shelter.  This is an old shelter in a very lovely setting.  Deep in the woods,  really really tall trees, a 20 foot wide creek 20 yards in front of the shelter and lots of green on the forest floor. Absolutely picturesque!
We claimed our spots in the shelter and I immediately took of my shoes grabbed my water bag and filter and started soaking my shin as I gathered, filtered and drank water. That was very nice. It wasn't long until there was  duck in the creek near me, a McDuck that is, and soon came JFK.  JFK's Group was cooling off in the creek. Then even though it was early we ate our supper, brushed our toothies, and hung our food bags so the alleged bears don't get our food. And as the sun goes down behind the mountain I'm predicting that some of us will be in the bag before 6:30pm. Such be the life of this here hiker.
Today we hiked 14.2 miles, 38,035 steps, low 48° high 67°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Dripping Rock Ovetlook mile 850 12.7 miles where we hope to get picked up and taken to a hostel.

When I woke up this morning you could tell it was light but because we were down in a gap or holler the sun hadn't made it over the top of the mountain. That made for an interesting look to the forest. It was a few minutes after 7am and another good night's sleep. We all got busy with our morning chores and by moments after 8am we were on trail. 
We immediately started on a 2100 foot climb to the top of Three Ridges Mountain.  There were lots of steep straight up stuff and several good rock scrambles to challenge us. Now thats the way to get your blood flowing in the morning. Then we work our way down just a bit and found Hanging Rock Overlook. Wow, what spectacular views we had. I had a very relaxing and inspirational time there. I probably sang How Great Thou Art 10 times while we were there looking over the valley from on top of the mountain. We probably stayed close to an hour, which is not something we normally would do. Sure hated to move on, but Maine awaits. We continued on our hike came down through Reid's Gap and commented on how nice it would be if there was trail magic at this parking area, but sadly there was none. I wonder if they named Reid's gap after my grandson? Onwards we went towards the Three Ridges Overlook and as we are approaching it a young man and his dog came hiking towards us. He said, are you thru hikers, we replied yes, he said great follow me for a sandwich. He didn't have to ask twice. 
I picked up my pace and soon spotted a white van with a young lady sitting just outside of it. She introduced herself as Beamer and the dog as Beans. The young man's name is Nugget. He fixed each of us a huge ham sandwich with fresh spinach leaves and some kind of special mayonnaise on fresh bread. Had to be one of the best sandwiches ever! They were so kind and inviting to us, they told us of much of their hike in 2018 and asked us lots of questions. They had selected this particular spot for doing trail magic because when they hiked they thought this section was the hardest in Virginia and they had begun to get homesick after a couple months on trail. This was their way of helping some other hikers. For me it was so inspiring to see this young couple and their dog giving back to complete  strangers.  Thank you Nugget, Beamer and Beans you guys are true Trail Angels. 
As much as we just wanted to stay with this young couple we needed to get on up the trail so, away we went. There remained about 4.5 miles left in today's journey and the terrain was fairly flat and mostly rocky. On the way JFK made contact with our shuttle driver and the only thing that was certain was that there was confusion.  He also made contact with the Quality Inn and secured rooms for us tonight. Near the end of the day were more great views from ledges looking over the valley that Waynesboro is in. 
When we arrived at Dripping Rock Parking Area there was no shuttle driver. Not to worry cause about 20 minutes later the driver we had used while at the hostel in Glasgow showed up and explained that they were having some issues at the hostel in Waynesboro and that he had been sent up to help rectify them if possible. We shared the shuttle with Rock Lizard and her dad. We arrived and checked into the Quality Inn, showered, then made our way to a place downtown that served ""the best hamburgers"". I thought mine was very tasty, however, I also think spam singles are very tasty. Then it was a short walk to Wal-Mart for our resupply. Back at the room we sorted our resupply,  McDuck did our laundry and we got caught up on some phone calls. 
Today we hiked 12.7 miles, 34,772 steps, low 57° high 73°. Tomorrow we are aiming for a slack pack of around 14 miles, the shuttle will be at the hotel about 7:30am.

We were up at 6am this morning so that we would have time for a gourmet breakfast and to be ready when the shuttle arrived.  We were down for breakfast by 6:30 where I had scrambled eggs, waffles, yogurt and multiple glasses of juice.  Blue joined us and he had hiked yesterday what we plan to hike today.  He was able to give us some insight as to how our day might go. He was also waiting on a shuttle and when one pulled up at 7:05am he thought it was his. Wrong, it was ours 25 minutes early. So, we got to hustle and get our stuff together and back to the shuttle.  No problem. 
Away we went to our drop off spot sharing the ride again with Rock Lizard and her dad. We were in the woods by 7:45 ready for another beautiful day. I kinda struggle today with which picture was going to take top of the fold. You see there were a few to choose from.  Obviously the fireplace chimney picture was my final choice and I'll get to my whys here in a minute. Another choice might have been a picture of an Owl. While hiking along this owl flew up from beside us and the trail into a tree not far away.  It just carefully watched us take pictures of it. That was pretty cool today.
 
Or I might have chosen the snakes that were mating just beside the trail.  Two large black snakes. I ain't never seen that before. Or I might have chosen the trail magic that we received today. Aileron's wife was on trail today handing out Snicker bars to all thru hikers.  That was a nice treat and she was so enthusiastic and friendly. 
However,  as you see I selected the picture of the W. J. Mayo homeplace. I can see your wondering why? After all it's just a picture of what's left of an old home place and only the fireplace and chimney remain.  I couldn't help but wonder why build there, what was it that brought Mr. Mayo deep into the forest to build a home? I suppose there could be multiple reasons however, the research I've done into this leads me to think that he picked this place because he was looking for an isolated location to work on an invention. Perhaps he is the inventor of mayonnaise. I think you can now understand why I picked that picture for top of the fold. 
As we started our hike we had a 700 foot climb to start our day. Not so bad except for the excessive use of rock in the trail. Then we came down about 2000 feet to the Paul Wolf Shelter where we stopped for a snack and water fill. After a short break we hiked on passing the Lowe family graves which made me wonder if there is a family connection to the Lowe family I know back home. A little further along and we came to the ruin of Mr. Mayo's place. By this time the trail had become very nice and we sailed on in to Rockfish Gap. Next up for us on trail is the Shenandoah Park.  Thru hikers are required to fill out a permit for the park and keep part of it displayed on our packs, so, we hiked on up the trail a bit and completed our permits. We did it this way because we plan to hike south bound tomorrow and will, in theory, need the permits. If it sounds a bit confusing it is.
Then McDuck called for a shuttle to take us back to the hotel and in a few minutes one came and rescued us. We cleaned up rested a bit and then went in search of food.  This evening we tried the Outback and found it very tasty.  Back to our rooms to work on journals and plan some for the next few days.  Today we hiked 14.3 miles, 35,196 steps, low 67° high 80°. Tomorrow we are aiming for a slack pack about 20 miles.

Up again at 6am so we would be ready for our shuttle at 7:30, or after yesterday morning 7:05am. However, today would be a different story. By 7:45 we had heard nothing from Spotter our shuttle driver and McDuck started working the phone. He couldn't get ahold of Spotter and tried several other possible shuttle drivers with not much luck.  He made contact with Stanimals and they said a driver didn't show and as soon as one became available they would send him. While on that call Spotter texted McDuck and said he would be here in about 30 minutes.  Our 7:30 pick up was now more like a 9am pick up.  Eventually we made it to Blackrock Gap and started hiking around 9:30am. 
We had been told that the hiking in the Shenandoahs would be some easier and the first couple of miles proved that to be true. There were a few steep climbs and some steep descents but overall I thought the terrain was a little less challenging than the past several days. We crossed the Shenandoah Parkway 3 or 4 times today and saw several other hikers along the trail.  About 11:30 it decided to rain on us a bit. Never seemed to rain really hard but was steady for a couple of hours.  This afternoon when we reached the top of Little Calf Mountain you could see across the valley and up on the next mountain several communication towers. About an hour later we were on top of that mountain with the communication towers. I always enjoy being able to see the next mountain you will climb or to see the ones you have climbed. 
 
As we descended off of that mountain I got to visit with my sweet wife and favorite daughter.  We chit chatted about all sorts of important stuff.  As we hiked closer to our end point the rain started up again and the trail became a bit more challenging with lots of rocks. Around 5pm we had reached our destination for the day and McDuck had called for the shuttle.  Two other hikers joined us and they are Pusher and Morning Glory. 
We arrived back at the hotel and immediately got out of our wet clothes got cleaned up and put on our best back up clothes and headed out for, you guessed it, food. The choice for tonight was mexican and was tasty. After eating we walked over to the quick stop type store looking for corn nuts.  No luck. 
Back at the hotel we husseled around and got our laundry going because last load starts at 9pm. We just made it in time. Laundry finished then we worked on getting stuff organized and packed. Some of the stuff is still wet from today's rain and will have to be packed up tomorrow. 
Today we hiked 20 miles, 45,733 steps, low 68° high 71°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Pinefield Hut 898.3 14 miles.

Before I start my normal entry I want to say Happy Mothers Day to my mom. Thank you for all the years of love and support.  I love you!
We were up at 6am for the third time in a row, something needs to change. I got myself ready and down for breakfast we went. By now you can probably guess what I had so I'll skip that part. We weren't sure if the shuttle driver would arrive on time or not but we were ready when about 20 minutes early he arrived. Upon arrival Spotter awarded me with a Stanimals t-shirt for having the fastest 20 mile slack pack. Away we went back into the Shenandoah Park headed for Blackrock Gap Trailhead our starting place for today. 
We hadn't been on trail 10 minutes when we came upon a turkey on trail.  No not that kind of turkey, the real bird kind of turkey.  We stopped and became very still with our cameras out and the turkey just ignored us. She walked right up to us and even pecked at my shoes. It was quite fascinating being that close to a wild turkey. Hopefully when I  can post this I can include some video of the encounter. 
Then we were off again. The trail was pretty good most of the day but, just to keep you honest it would throw in some rocks or a steep climb or both. Then we made it to Blackrock where we had fantastic views of a large valley. Our next stop was the Loft Mountain Camp Store.  This store had all things that a hiker would like.  So we liked several things. While there we met Baby Shark a section hiker who was hiking a similar distance as us today.  She is at the Hut with us tonight. They also had a place for our trash and real clean restrooms. There are more of these in the Shenandoah Park and we are looking forward to them. 

Next were the Cliffs and Ledges with more excellent views. Then we came to My Creek Overlook where the trail meets the Shenandoah Parkway.  More great views! From there it was just over a mile to our home for the night at Pinefield Hut. What is a Hut you ask and is it much different than a shelter? The answer is a Hut is just like a shelter only in Shenandoah they call it a Hut instead of calling it a shelter.  I hope that clears up any confusion. We arrived around 3pm and claimed our hut spots just like we used to claim shelter spots. Then because there is a small creek in front of the Hut I went down and soaked my shin. Now that felt nice! 
After soaking my shin I started eating trying to get through the dinner meal I had brought as well as the snacks for today that I didn't eat because of the stuff I ate at the store. Oh well, there is always some kind of adversity to overcome on trail. As the early evening arrived a deer shows up at the Hut. How much fun. Several hikers have joined us here tonight.  I haven't caught many names however,  Maps is one we've hiked with before. 
Today we hiked 14 miles, 35 steps, low 57° high 71°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Big Meadows Lodge a our 20 miles.

Today is my 42nd wedding anniversary. I want to say Happy Anniversary to my sweet wife of 42 years. You are the best and I'm so thankful that you chose to be my wife.  I love you more each new day we get.
We got to sleep in this morning, all the way to 6;15am. Then it was get around and get moving time. I was on trail by about 7:15 trying to click off the miles early. I had the opportunity to visit with Gorgeous this morning which was a nice surprise. McDuck and JFK caught me just as I hit the 900 mile mark.  Woo Hoo, we have now completed and celebrated completing 900 miles.  
Then we hiked on till we hit a great view spot. I tried to upload my journal but no luck for me. Then off we hiked and about 2 miles from Hightop Parking Area we met a couple that said, are you guys thru hikers,  we said yes, they said there is trail magic 2 miles ahead. I immediately picked up my pace. Soon we came out of the woods to wonderful trail magic.  Caveman had quite the spread, chili, veggies, fruit, cookies, drinks and chairs with backs. It was absolutely wonderful. Maps and Baby Shark were already partaking by the time we arrived so we joined them. Caveman you did absolutely perfect! Thank you very much for your kindness to a bunch of complete strangers. 
After that feast, 3 bowls of chili for me, I began my waddle back on trail. This afternoon there was lots of hiking and not many sights. The trail today was again mostly good but, there were still several climbs that were very challenging. Around 3:30pm we made it to the Lewis Mountain Camp Ground. We found the camp store and got some refreshments, connected back up with Blue and Baby Shark. Maps came strolling in after a bit and the discussion was about where to spend the night. Blue was moving on and after we learned that the cabins were all full the 5 of us picked out a camp site and set up our tents.  After getting mine set up I started to get the registration paperwork and go pay when I found out that Baby Shark had paid for all of us. Thank you Baby Shark you need not have done that, but I'm very grateful. 
Then it was dinner time and I enjoyed eating again. We visited amongst ourselves till the air got cool and that signaled time to head for the bags. For all of you paying close attention, yes yesterday I awarded my self another wrong direction merit. Yea me!
Today we hiked 19.7 miles, 45,362 steps, low 51° high 68°. Tomorrow we are aiming for town at probably to many miles from here.

When I finally started stirring this morning it was close to 7am. Sleeping in my tent was a good comfortable night's sleep. I did enjoy the hoot owl a couple of times last night but that was about the only noise till the birds began to sing around 5:30am. Like I said about 7am the morning process began and today it includes taking down and putting away the tent. Been awhile since I did that. 
We finished packing up and said our farewells to Baby Shark as soon she will be off trail and back to school and work. Best wishes to you Baby Shark, enjoyed the time we got to hike with you. We wanted to say by to Maps but he was not to be found. I feel certain our paths will cross again. 
We found the trail again about 8:30am and were hiking. It was a froggy morning so our first two view spots were lots of white. This mornings hike wasn't to tough. We had a couple of steep climbs but they didn't last long. It was later in the morning when the steep trail and rocks combined or the rocks just stayed no matter what the trail did. We got nice views from Blackrock Viewpoint up near Big Meadows Lodge, and more views from Franklin Cliffs. Then we had a nice rocky climb up to what they called a Scree Field. It's where there had been a rock slide down the mountain. Lovely. NOT! 
 
Somewhere along in here we came upon a deer that didn't seem too concerned about us. It was fun watching her watch us.  
From there it continued to be a rocky mess until we reached Skyland Resort. Was I every glad to see that place. 
We intended to eat a bite there but the restaurant was closed as well as the grab and go sandwich place. Plan C was hit the store for a cold drink and a snack. It wasn't long until our shuttle arrived and away we went. We stopped near by and picked up three recently graduated college young ladies and dropped them off for their week-long section hike of part of the AT in the Shenandoahs. Then on the way to our hotel in Luray the shuttle driver needed to stop and make some phone calls and she stopped at a DQ. Yes we did. While she talked we got ice cream. Choco Strawberry. Yum yum! You know I've heard somewhere that ice cream is the most important meal of the day. After that treat it was a short drive to the Cardinal Inn our home for the night. 
We immediately walked over to Jess' Hotdogs and had hamburgers. Well to be fair McDuck had hotdogs. It was all tasty.  Then it was back to the room get cleaned up, make some tentative plans for tomorrow,  work on our journals and head for bed. Tomorrow I get to see my Sweetheart of 42 years.  Woo hoo!
Today we hiked 16.7 miles, 38,796 steps, low 54° high 66°. Tomorrow we are aiming for a slack pack from Skyland Resort to VA Route 211 with my life long friend David. About 10 miles.

Didn't get up today until after 7am, got myself ready to go eat and McDuck and I walked up the street to a gas station that had a small little diner place in it. The lady behind the counter wasn't the most friendly person but she made good breakfast sandwiches.  We ate and headed back to the room so McDuck could be ready for his meeting this morning.  While he was working I visited with the lady that was managing the hotel. We had a good conversation about many different topics. 
Then David and Sarah arrived with my sweet wife and the world was good again. Not long after their arrival McDuck finished up and we loaded up the car headed for Skyland Resort our starting place for today. David was joining JFK's Group today for our slack pack. It was about 11:30am when we hit the trail.  Today's trail was not bad except for the rocks at times.  We enjoyed great views at Little Stoney Man Cliffs.  JFK even got his picture made by some day hikers at the cliffs. As we hiked along there were a few places where we had views overlooking Luray. As we hiked today we had another close encounter with a deer and a more distant encounter with a turkey. 
It was about half way through the day when we reached Birds Nest Hut. We stopped in to read the log book and take a quick break.  While there we met Intrepid and Iron Momma two section hikers one going north and one going south. Shortly after that we enjoyed a couple of great views of the valley from a slightly different point of view. Then it was a down hill hike to where Gorgeous and Sarah were waiting to pick us up. They had done there own hiking, bird watching, and sightseeing today and were ready to tell their stories as long as we were headed somewhere to eat.
Back to Jess' Famous Hotdogs we went and filled our bellies.  Next stop was Walmart for food and supplies for the next few days. Soon we were at the Airbnb that David and Sarah had arranged for. We all found our places and began to get settled and then showered.  By this time its 7pm and time to go looking for food. We found a nice Mexican restaurant in Front Royal and were nice and full when we left.
Back to the Airbnb we headed for our rooms and were soon to bed. Everyone was pretty tired after long days yesterday and a busy day today.  It is so good to have David and Sarah come out to visit and to bring my sweet wife with them is extra special. Gorgeous also brought some goodies from one of our journal readers Jan. Thank you Jan for being so kind to us. I also got some ice cream money from Miss Betty and Darla. Can't wait to use that, cause I heard somewhere that ice cream is the most important meal of the day. Thank you Miss Betty and Darla. Darla also sent some jerky. Yum yum.
Today we hiked 9.7 miles, 24,855 steps, low 59° high 66°. Tomorrow we are aiming for another slack pack of around 13 miles. David plans to join us again, should be another great day.

The house began to come alive about 7am this morning with activity in the kitchen.  I got myself ready and headed down to see what was cooking. What was cooking was pancakes and bacon. So like any hungry hiker I sat down and partook. Eight pancakes and five pieces of bacon. Yum yum. 
After kitchen clean up and everyone getting ready we were off to the Shenandoah Park to find our starting place.  Hogback Overlook was the place and Sarah and Gorgeous dropped us off. We found the trail and southbound we headed as we were slack packing southbound today. We hiked a quarter to half a mile and came to the road crossing at the Hogback Trailhead parking. There we quickly noticed a sign that read trail closed search in progress. JFK soon found out that there was an ongoing search for a missing young man and that the next portion of the trail was closed until further notice. Well, what to do? McDuck got out his Farout app and spotted another trail/road crossing a mile down the road where we could get back on trail. So, off down the road we went a walking.  Gorgeous and Sarah drive by and are curious as to whats going on and we gave them a brief explanation and had them wait for us at the next pullout just in case the trail was closed there also. It wasn't and we were able to be back on trail and the ladies headed off on their own adventures. Our prayers are with the missing young man, his family, and the searchers. 
A couple of miles later we had arrived at the Elkwallow Wayside where I was looking forward to a Blackberry Shake. When we arrived we learned that the diner portion of the wayside didn't open until 11am about 30 minutes from when we arrived. We decided to wait since we had missed all of the other waysides. The blackberry shake was good but not worth the wait since there were no blackberries injured in the making of the shake. While there, we ran into All Trails who we have hiked with a time or two. Then we were off again, the trail was mostly pleasant today, there were sections of rocks but I would take today's trail most any day. We crossed paths with Mad Dog, Blue Grass, Good Soup, Four Low, a new Mad Dog from Michigan, and Catdorito. On this stretch of trail we kept hearing about a dead deer on the trail.  Sure enough right in the middle of the trail it laid. No obvious cause of death was noted. 
It wasn't long before we arrived at Beahmans Gap road crossing and there were two lovely ladies doing trail magic, so we went up to see what they had. And you'll never believe who it was, Gorgeous and Sarah. They had a crowd so we joined them for a while. That left us about 3 miles to finish the day and away we went.  Not long before we were to the end Gorgeous and Sarah met us on trail and escorted us to the car.
Then it was off in search of food, so we headed to Front Royal and stopped at the Blue Winged Frog and filled our bellies.  Gorgeous and I had the Reuben sandwich and it left a little to be desired. Next it was Blizzard time so we found a DQ three counties over and thanks to family back home we all had ice cream.  You know I've heard somewhere that ice cream is the most important meal of the day. 
Back at the Airbnb there was excitement in the air when JFK's package was spotted on the front porch. New hiking shoes! Showers were on most of our minds as well as getting prepared for tomorrows hike. There might also be some not so late night snacking. 
Today we hiked 11.3 miles,26,639 steps, low 42° high 58°. Tomorrow we are aiming for another slack pack in the 16 mile range.

I  heard people beginning to stir about 6:45am this morning and I started stirring myself. I slept great last night and felt rested this morning which is a great feeling. Got myself downstairs and David was busy frying bacon and Gorgeous was ready to start on the eggs.  Before long I was enjoying bacon, eggs and toast for breakfast, and as an appetizer I had a honey bun. Very tasty. 
It wasn't long before we were back on the road to our starting place. I could sure get used to this kind of hiking. We arrived at Hogback Overlook and the communication trucks were still there helping with the search for the missing man. We got our packs on and did our pre hike stuff and while we were doing that another hiker walked up and seemed to be looking for a ride more than hiking, so we sent Gorgeous on down the road to avoid any complications with him
We then started for our spot on the trail and upon arriving noticed some pink tape across the trail opening. Not knowing if it was indicating that they had sprayed the trail or what it was for ,we ducked under it and started walking. Very soon we heard a police type siren so we stopped and listened. We could see through the trees part of a Park Rangers truck on the road but heard nothing else. So, we kept on hiking. 
We Very quickly met a lady coming south and she said the trail was open where she had come from. The trail was really nice again for most of the day and with McDuck in the lead we covered almost 10 miles in 3 hours.  That is hiking fast for this guy. It was another cool froggy morning and all the views were the same, a white fogg. As we hiked into Compton Gap we could see our ladies had set up Trail Magic there. We stopped and partook of the offerings and caught up on their day thus far. Then it was back to hiking. We had just over six more miles left in our day and with a new leader the pace slowed. This section started off terrific and then without warning we were back into the rocks and at times a steep downhill. It wasn't long before we could see a crowd gathered behind a car and sure enough it was Gorgeous and Sarah doing trail magic. We had met three Canadians on trail who had participated in the trail magic and now there was seven or eight others gobbling up the goodies these Trail Angels had brought. All of the hikers were very thankful for the trail magic. The names I remember are Gin, Blue Grass, Mandalorian, Tacos, Malca, and Mountain Turtle.
McDuck's daughter, wife and friend made it and they headed off in one direction and we headed into Front Royal for Italian food.  Sarah found a little place and the food was excellent. Then it was back to the Airbnb where I showered and got clothes in the washer. I want to get them sprayed with Permethrin before bed time tonight.  We are planning a zero for tomorrow with a trip to Washington DC for sight seeing.  Ought to be a fun day. We sat outside tonight and visited for awhile and enjoyed a nice big bowl of ice cream.  You know I've heard somewhere that ice cream is the most important meal of the day.  About 8pm we decided it had cooled off plenty and was near bedtime. 
Today we hiked 16.4 miles, 35,462 steps, low 49° high 69°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Washington DC, a combination zero and sightseeing day.

Up before the 6am alarm this morning excited about our day trip to DC. We ate a fix your own breakfast and were out the door by 6:30am. We had about 1:30 minute drive to the Ashburn Metro station where we would meet up with McDuck and his crew for the train ride into DC. It was another hour ride on the train to our hopping off spot near the mall in DC.
First we saw the Washington Monument then the reflecting pool, Abraham Lincoln Memorial, and way in the distance the Capital. We moved over to the Vietnam Wall and then made our way over to the White House. Then we walked through the streets noticing buildings like the Old Post Office, Treasury building, IRS, Federal Reserve, FBI and many others. We went in the Federal Archives building and saw the Declaration of Independence and other documents. We took a break and had Shake Shack for lunch before seeing some of the museum of Natural History and the museum that has the flag that inspired the National Anthem.  Finally we took the train out to Arlington Cemetery to witness the changing of the Guard. That is always a moving ceremony. 
Back on the train our main guide Stephanie guided us through the maze of trains back to the Silver Line headed back to Ashburn. It was a little more than an hour back to Ashburn where McDuck and his crew went their way and we hopped back in the car and started looking for food. We found a Chipotle very close and hustled in as it had started to rain. I got me one of the bowls and in no time finished it off. Pretty good stuff.  I'm not sure what all was in it even though I got to pick. I just kept pointing at stuff and they kept piling it on. Then it was time to head home.  About an hour and a half later David pulled us safely into the drive. We were all tired from our days adventure and headed to our rooms. 
Today we hiked zero miles, 20,353 steps, and no idea how warm it got. Tomorrow we plan on another zero day with worship first then we may drive up to Harper's Ferry to see what we see.

Up at the glorious hour of 8am to a beautiful Sunday morning in Virginia. I made it down to the kitchen where JFK and Gorgeous were visiting. I got my avocado and ate it while Gorgeous fixed me some eggs. Then I got cleaned up for worship. About 10:30 we headed into Luray to drop JFK off at the grocery store while we found the church.  There were about twenty very friendly people at the building who made us feel very welcome. 
After services were over we found JFK ate a bite then headed back to the house to drop off JFK and the groceries and then we headed to Harper's Ferry to meet up with McDuck and his crew. We met at the ATC building there and explored it thoroughly. We then set out on foot to see the town, especially the historical sights. After about an hour we had seen what we wanted to and were ready for food. The ladies selected The Anvil where I enjoyed crab cakes. After a very enjoyable dinner time it was time for McDuck to say goodbye to his family and load up with us to head back to the Airbnb. 
David brought us safely home and we each got busy getting stuff ready for an early start in the morning. Since I've been such a good boy today I treated myself to a bowl of ice cream a Ginger Ale and some Bugles. A good way to end the day.

First before I get into my normal journal I want to thank David and Sarah and my wife Gorgeous for coming out to Virginia to support us on our hike. The place to stay, the food, the slack packing,  the trail magic and most of all the time we spent together was simply wonderful. David I was so glad that you got to join us on trail. It was nice sharing that experience with you.  And to David's dad, the real Mr. Dirrim, thank you for the copper infused compression leggings. I wore them Wednesday thru Sunday and hiked all day Monday without any shin issues. You can't beat that.
We were up early so we could get on trail by 7:30am. Today we have a 20 mile slack pack that David joined us on and then after dropping David off with the ladies so that they could start there way home we started our three mile full pack hike to the next shelter.  Yes they are back to being called shelters and not huts. The trail was again kind to us for the majority of the day. There were the occasional rocky sections, but if you are going twenty miles today's trail was a good one. We got excellent trail magic at about mile eight and again at about mile twenty from Sarah and Gorgeous, Cold Gatorades, candy bars, fruit, and other snacks. Those two ladies sure know how to do trail magic. 
As we journeyed the last three miles we spotted a large black snake defending his spot of the trail, I did the snake shuffle as I slid by it. And then just a short bit later I noticed some black fur on the side of the trail and as I was beginning to jump away noticed it was a dead cat. It had my full attention for just a second. We arrived at the Rod Hollow Shelter around 5pm claimed our spots in the shelter and began our evening chores. Water is close and flowing great so that was nice. I then sat down and visited with Shoe Laces, What If, and No Regrets as I ate my supper. I worked on my journal and rested my tired feet while working to dry my hiking clothes. Several folks are at the shelter or are tenting near by. Some of them include Sketch, and Professor Sprout.

Up at 6:45 this morning as our shelter mate got a very early start. We were on trail by about 7:45am. Just a short distance later we found the sign that announced the beginning of the Roller Coaster.  This is a series of sharp ups and downs over a 14 mile run. We have over the years heard all kinds of stories about how difficult they are and even some that said they weren't hard at all. I will say they were tough, steep ups and downs with multitudes of rocks in all shapes and sizes. It is possible that several days of slack packing may have lulled me into a false sense of ability, however, my feet tell me that today was tough. 
Next on our lists of milestones for today was the 1000 mile mark. Yes boys and girls we have now walked more than 1000 miles. Fist bumps were had all around and we celebrated with a soft drink and Girl Scout short bread cookies complements of the caretaker of the place we are staying tonight, Amelia. Thank you Amelia very much for the goodies. 
Then after several more ups and downs and of bunch of rocks, we made it to the Virginia/West Virginia state line. It was on a rocky up hill climb and we all had our heads down looking for foot placement and walked right by the nice sign that indicated the state line. Fortunately McDuck looked at his phone and discovered our error before we had gone much past it. Again fist bumps all around and the soft drinks and cookies celebration. 
Also during the day we ran into a hiker we have not seen since we exited the Smokies. We saw him last at Standing Bear Hostel at mile 241.5 sometime near the end of March. Have you guessed who it might be? It was Pink! We were all absolutely sure we would see him again its just the way the trail works. We hollered at him and he came running over saying bring it in here, which is Pink for I want to hug you. As we walked on we couldn't help but shake our heads and laugh at what had just happened. Pretty amazing! He was with some hikers we knew and some we didn't. Those hanging with Pink were  Oz, Thumper, and Whole Foods.
 
We had selected Blackburn Trail Center for our stop tonight. It is a place with a bunk house and several tenting places, a solar shower, and picnic tables. We selected tent spots set up and walked over to the picnic tables.  Amelia came out and welcomed us and provided the Trail magic previously mentioned. We all took a nice cool solar shower and then chilled out for a while before retiring to our tents and bags for a good night's rest. 
Today we hiked 17.8 miles, 43,861 steps, low 67° high 73°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Harper's Ferry 11.9 miles. Another Milestone tomorrow so stay tuned.

Up with the birds, literally this morning, they had such a beautiful song I had to record some of it. I kinda got myself organized and went ahead and ate before finishing packing up. I was hoping the bottom of the tent would dry but that didn't happen.  By 8am we were headed up the trail.  
However,  before I get to deep into today let's talk about Virginia since in theory I'm out of that state. Recollections of Virginia include great views, especially McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs. There were many many others as we hiked,  The Blue Ridge Parkway and Shenandoah Park stick out in my mind amongst the many other view points we enjoyed so much. Flowers, especially up to about two thirds of the way through the Shenandoah Park. I couldn't begin to name them all but their beauty is still etched in my mind. I do especially remember the Rhododendron, Mountain Laurel, Fire Azalea and the Spiderwart. The people, from hikers, shuttle drivers, and hostel owners. We met some wonderful people who I think would do anything for you they could. Wildlife, snakes, squirrels, deer, birds, frogs, but still after 1000 miles no alleged bears. Rocks, some were huge and we could see fantastic views from them but many were on the trail and not so much fun. Virginia was and is a beautiful state and I'm very grateful to have accomplished hiking thru it.
 
 
Now back to today and the hike. Right off the bat we had a nice view of the valley and then it was much hiking and not much viewing.  I did see a bunch of squirrels today.  Not sure why that was but if I said 30 or 40 it wouldn't be an exaggeration. McDuck pointed out a deer as we hiked along but because of the rocks we were focused on footing for much of the day. As we got closer to Harper's Ferry the traffic on the bridge over the Shenandoah River kinda made you want to hustle a bit. We crossed over the river on the highway bridge and found the path up, and I mean up to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy building.  This is where we had our picture made and got the number of hiker we are as we pass thru Harper's Ferry. My number is 343. When we started this journey I was the 589th hiker to register, now I'm number 343. There's not much significance in either number, just people keeping track of numbers mostly. 
After the picture we headed up the street to a bakery for some snacks and then tried to resupply at a 7 11. That Didn't work so JFK got us an Uber to Wal-Mart. We resupplied and bought stuff for supper tonight, then Ubered to the Quality Inn our home for tonight.  We showered got our food bags organized and other wise kept our feet up.

Up at a little after 7am this morning got ready and headed down for Quality Inn breakfast. They actually had a nice spread and I tried most of it. JFK dropped in while we were eating and was ready to go so we hustled around and were hiking by about 8am. 
We climbed up the hill again and followed the trail through town.  That was neat, having seen it on video a few times to be actually doing it myself. Then we crossed the bridge and started down the C&O Canal Towpath, which is a nice wide level path. Me like that kind of hiken! Nearly 3 miles of delightful hiking. After we entered the woods and had a nice climb we came upon the Weverton Cliffs and a great view over the Potomac River. 
Next on the list of neat things today was Gathland State Park. We saw the tomb where Mr. Gath is not buried.  That is correct not buried.  Who is buried in Gaths tomb? The answer is located near the end of this episode. There was a nice bench near a water hydrant and a real restroom. We enjoyed a very nice snack break there. Shortly after leaving there we met Willin headed south on the trail. We stopped to visit and found out he is having to get off trail. He was obviously very sad about getting off trail and we wish him all the best. There is a picture of me and him near the bottom of this entry.
Next was the view at White Rocks Overlook.  Another nice view of the valley surrounded by mountains. Then we worked our way to the Dahlgren Backpackers Campground where the is a shower house with hot water and restrooms. How nice. We are all set up in our tents and looking forward to a cool night for sleeping. And by the way no one is buried in Gaths tomb, it was never used. 
 
Today we hiked 17.1 miles, 40,545 steps, low 57° high 66°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Ensign Cowell Shelter 1057.2 or 14 miles.

Before I forget again we've completed another state. We crossed the West Virginia/Maryland line yesterday. I normally like to show a picture of that but there was no sign to take a picture of. So, welcome to Maryland. 
This morning around 5:30am some truck driver hit his jake brake and I thought he was driving right through my tent. Which means that I was up early. I got dressed and got my tent emptied out so I could hang it up to let the bottom of it dry a little. I ate and made good use of the facilities at Dahlgren's. By 8am we were on trail.
First up today was the Washington Monument. This monument was built to honor Washington before the one in DC. We spent a little time there enjoying the views. Then we hiked a few miles till we crossed under I-70 and started up to Annapolis rock and Black rock overlooks. We stopped at Black rock and had snacks while we enjoyed the views. From there we covered lots of miles till we got to Raven Rock Road.  A couple of Maryland Ridge Runners we had met just a little early told us that our best bet was to get water just up from the road at the Cascades and carry it to the shelter because there was not any water close to the shelter. As we crossed the road and started up the hill we soon reached what in wetter times might have been a cascade but today was a trickle. With enough time we were able to collect enough water for tonight and in the morning. Then we trudged up the hill to the shelter. There was room in the shelter but we decided to put up our tents.  For me it is less noisy in my tent. 
Once the tents were up we ate and visited with Maps who showed up here and after eating we hung our food bags on the bear cables provided.  After visiting with a guy from Maryland I headed over to my tent to start on this journal entry. Supposed to be another cool night in the upper 40's low 50's so should be good sleeping. 
Today we hiked 18 miles, 42,767 steps, low 51° high 68°. Tomorrow, the original plan was to aim for Tumbling Run Shelter at mile 1075.6 which would be a 14.4 mile day. We may try and stretch that out some to make Sunday not such a long day.

Up at a little after 6:30 birds a chirping and a few people stirring. Did all the usual morning chores and was on trail by 8am. 
A couple of miles up trail was High Rock Ledges where for some reason it is a place where graffiti is painted on the rocks.  There is a great view from this point if you don't mind the graffiti. My mom often said that I didn't mind. About four miles later we were in Pen Mar Park. This is a park very near the Maryland/Pennsylvania line. Yes, that means we've crossed into our next state of Pennsylvania. At Pen Mar Park we stopped and snacked, filled up on water, emptied our trash, and pottied. There is also some nice views from this park. Then moments just moments later we were at the Mason/Dixon Line, where north meets south. It seemed a little arbitrary out in the woods today. We signed the log book and moved on.
We made our way on to Old Forge Park, yes we stopped at another nice park where you could order pizza and they would deliver to the park. So McDuck did. Four pizzas, three subs, three salads and four root beers. Then eight of us consumed all but the three subs which were saved for dinner or in my case half saved for breakfast. Thank you McDuck, that was great trail magic!
After that feast we waddled the last mile to Tumbling Run Shelters. There are two shelters one labeled Snoring and one Non-snoring. We chose to stay in tents again. Shortly after setting up tents I hustled down to the creek to soak my feet.  Oh the simple pleasures of life. Then we gathered around the picnic tables and visited while we ate. Lots of laughs and fun stories come from these picnic table times. By 6:30 I was ready for my bag.
Today we hiked 14.4 miles, 32,012 steps, low 51° high 73°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Birch Run Shelter 19.6 miles. Yippee!

Up with the birds this morning as we had a big day planned. I wanted to slow my pace a little so I was up at 5:15 and on trail by 6am. I had half of a sub sandwich left from last night so as I walked I ate. I did have to wait until the 1st climb was over to start on the sandwich cause it was a steep one. 
A couple of miles in came the big view for the day from Chimney Rock. The sun wasn't very high in the sky yet and the light made it such a beautiful sight. Then about mile ten I strolled into Caledonia State Park. I must give Maryland and Pennsylvania points for having the AT trial go through these parks. They have water, restrooms, picnic tables, trash cans and the opportunity for trail magic. Everything was great except no one took advantage of providing trail magic. However, about two miles later a lady had set out a bag of goodies for thru hikers. Trail magic at last.
Then I just hiked. I very much enjoyed the Mountain Laurel in its several stages of blooming. Some had a very light pink tint and some was pure white. All was lovely. I saw lots of day hikers the last couple of days as its Memorial Day weekend. Many families with small children. It's making me look forward to when my Daughter her husband and her two youngins get to come hike with me. Thinking about that makes me wonder what trail names should be given to them? I'd gladly receive suggestions if you have any.
I rolled into the Birch Run Shelter area about 3:30 wore down from the days hike. This shelter is rumored to be host to bed bugs, so I got busy setting up my tent. About the time I finished that McDuck and JFK made their appearance. I then went down to the creek to soak my feet. I can usually keep my feet in the creek for 7 minutes before they are so cold I can't stand it. This creek I struggled to keep them in 4 minutes.  That's some cold water. After that I ate, I ate everything except my breakfast bars and some beef sticks. Later in the evening I got a second soak for those weary feet. Sure feels good when they warm up enough you can feel them. 
Tonight our little tramily is together again, and includes Catdorito, Four Low, Maps, and Eight Lives plus the three of us. 
Today we hiked 19.6 miles, 47,471 steps, low 46° high 72°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Pine Grove Furnace for the half gallon challenge. We will attempt to eat a half gallon of ice cream in one hour. For the coveted award. More on that tomorrow. It is about 10 miles into Pine Grove.

Up with the birds again but this time I had no plans on hitting the trail early. I guess the birds didn't know what my plans were. Finally about 6am I got started on my morning chores and around 6:45am was on my way to a day filled with fun stuff. 
About 4 miles in was the first thing, which was a big thing. At mile 1099.2 we had reached the halfway point in this journey.  Yes, that is correct boys and girls, men and women we have now hiked half of the 2198.4 miles that make up this trail. It took 90 days for the 1st half I wonder how many days for the 2nd? Big millstone for us and fist bumps were shared.
Then .8 miles later we hit the 1100 mile mark with more pictures and fist bumps. Now if I was clever and or ambitious I would start counting down the miles to Katadyn. However, most of the time I'm to tired to do that kind of math. 
Soon we sauntered into the Pine Grove Furnace park where there is a store that hosts the Half Gallon Challenge.  For those that don't know this is a challenge to eat a half gallon of ice cream in one hour or less. We got to choose from a fairly good selection of flavors for our first carton of 3 pints of ice cream and then a small selection for the additional pints to get us to the half gallon.  I went with Raspberry for my large container and Strawberry for my small. We, McDuck, Four Low, Catdorito, Maps, Eight Lives and yours truly all sat down at a table outside and the festivities began. I went with the strategy of eating around the outer edges of the ice cream where it had melted some to speed up the eating. Eight Lives went back inside and got some milk to add to his to make it easier to eat. We spooned and spooned in the ice cream laughing at the faces we made and the different approaches to this challenge. Just after 25 minutes Eight Lives declared victory over his ice cream and just after 26 minutes I declared victory over mine. Of the six of us Catdorito was the only one not to declare victory, but she gave it all she had. At one point I wasn't sure she'd keep down what she'd eaten. For winning you got to sign the winners log book and receive the coveted little wooden ice cream spoon with the inscription, Member Of Half Gallon Club on it. It was a proud moment for me. You know I've heard somewhere that ice cream is the most important meal of the day. Then afterwards I had a cheeseburger for lunch. I only wish my daughter could have been there cause I think she might have set a new record. 
 
It was about then that JFK's friend trail name Johnny Bravo arrived and introductions all around the table were made. He is going to hike with us for a few days and that gives us the slack packing option, yea slack packing.  From there we wandered over to the museum which houses much of the history and many artifacts of the AT and looked and read about much of the AT history. 
Then it was on to the Sleep Inn in Carlisle Pennsylvania our home for the night.  Ahhhh the smell of a clean me and clean clothes already is in my mind. We checked in and quickly got clothes ready for the washer and then got myself in the shower. About 6:30pm we headed out for more food and then a quick stop at a Giant grocery store. Not that it was any bigger than most grocery stores, it's name just happens to be Giant. Back to the room we sorted items and got our bags ready for an early start in the morning.  We need to be out the door by 6:45am. 
Today we hiked 9.9 miles, 25,584 steps, low 51° high 75°. Tomorrow we are aiming for a 10 or so slack pack and then a trip to Gettysburg for a tour, and some kind of special address.

I slept in till 5:55am this morning with no birds to sing me awake. The plan for today included leaving the hotel by 6:45am so since breakfast didn't start till 6:30 we had to be ready to go once we had a chance to eat a little breakfast. 
JFK and Johnny Bravo dropped McDuck and me off at the trailhead on PA Route 94 and we started south bound. They then drove to the Pine Grove Furnace store where we devoured a half gallon of ice cream just yesterday, and started north bound. When we met each other on trail they would give us the car keys and once we got to the store we would hop in the car and go pick them up. Another one of those At first for us. That's what we did. Since McDuck and myself were south bound we got to see a few hikers we knew such as Catdorito, Four Low, Maps, and Saratonin. The hike today was fairly easy, not much elevation change and not too many rocks. What it had in abundance was the Mountain Laurel blooming. Millions of those white blooms lined the trail and at times were visible deep into the forest. Spectacular! 
We made the key exchange with no problems and soon McDuck and I were in the Pine Grove Furnace park. We first came upon a small lake with a nice looking sandy beach and swimming area that looked very inviting. Next was the actual furnace the place is named after. The furnace was used to melt iron ore and limestone to make iron. It appeared to have been a very labor intensive business. The next thing and probably the best thing of the hike was when we got to the store, as we were headed to the car we hear McDuck, TheOkie, man so good to see you, and low and behold one of our long lost hiking friends Bambi comes running over to give us big hugs. We had not seen Bambi since April 5th when he got off trail to treat a nasty rash that had developed on his back. That was over 700 miles ago. As I've mentioned before it is amazing how the trail brings people back together. We had a great few minutes catching up on each other's adventures,  but all to soon he had to get back to his own half gallon challenge and we needed to get JFK and Johnny Bravo picked up. We're sure looking forward to hiking with Bambi again soon.
 
We got JFK and Johnny Bravo picked up and headed off for our next big adventure for the day. A trip to Gettysburg. JFK had arranged for us to watch the 20 minute movie, view the 377 ft round painting of the battle fields and go on the two hour bus tour of the battle fields. It was very interesting and very heart wrenching to know what those people went through during those few days in Gettysburg. Thanks a bunch JFK for making all of the arrangements and for getting Johnny Bravo the Gettysburg address so he could drive us there.
 
 
After the tour we enjoyed dinner at the Blue and Grey bar and grill where I had a big burger named after one of the Generals from the north. Then we stopped by the local DQ for a blizzard. Because, say it with me now, I've heard somewhere that ice cream is the most important meal of the day.  Nicely done. Back to the hotel it was shower time and journal time. 
Today we hiked 10.5 miles, 27,178 steps, low 53° high 72°. Tomorrow we are aiming for US Route 11 about 17 miles of good old slack packing.

I slept until after 6:30am this morning and it felt nice.  As I looked over McDuck was busy on his phone making reservations and plans for our upcoming New York trip. It should be a fun one. I made my normal breakfast menu then we gathered up our gear and off we went. 
We were in the woods by 8:30am doing the key swap trick again. This time McDuck and I headed north and JFK and Johnny Bravo drove up trail and headed south. The trail for McDuck and me was fairly flat to start off with when I noticed off to my right about 15 to 20 feet this unusual flower that was lit up by a ray of sun. Much like it had a spot light on it. Well, I obviously needed a picture of that and was grateful of the gentle reminder from God to look for and enjoy the beauty He has created. Hopefully the picture is here. 
After a bit the trail turned upwards and was a little rocky and when I looked up to see where the trail went the whole hillside was blanketed in the white Mountain Laurel. Very very pretty. As we reached the top of this climb the trail transitioned into a big boulder rock maze. It was great fun climbing and weaving your way through the maze, and even challenging a time or two in keeping track of the trail. Next came a nice long downhill section where we passed a hiker named Hops and then soon after that met a southbound hiker named Chance. Last time we saw him we thought he was an employee for Woods Hole Hostel. Turns out he was just doing work for stay while we were there. He gave us some good info on the trail ahead for us. While visiting with him Hops caught us and asked if she could tag along with us for the rest of the day. Sure was the reply and away we went. Then just before we exited the woods into a field McDuck spotted a deer very near the trail. Man, does he have good eyes! From that point to the end of our day we would spend some time hiking in the woods and some time hiking in a field of some type. Could be a hay meadow, a wheat field, a corn field, or a field of just last year's stubble of some kind. The nicest thing about it was that it was mostly flat. 
The trail took us right into the town of Boiling Springs, where we got to see another furnace used for making iron. We also had our eyes peeled for the ATC building that had been condemned but still had a water hydrant for hikers. We easily spotted it and drank our fill and refilled our bottles. As we were doing that we could see across the road that JFK and Johnny Bravo had met up with Bambi so we crossed over and joined them. As usual Bambi kept us laughing with his stories and antics. As always the fun ends too soon and we all must get back to our hiking.
 
We, me, McDuck, and Hops headed on north out of town. It wasn't long before we were doing the field/forest thing again and that continued until we reached Interstate 81. There we took a short side trail down to the highway to begin our walk to todays hotel the Quality Inn. As we hike the roadway a guy steps out of a van and says ""you guys want a Gatorade or something cold to drink ""  absolutely we do. It turns out that it was Hops' husband who is supporting her hike. Not only did this Trail Angel provide us a cold drink, he also drove us to our hotel about a half mile down the very busy road. Thanks so much! 
Then we got in the car and drove back to where we started this morning and in just minutes JFK and Johnny Bravo came walking up. We made it back to the Quality Inn, checked in and relaxed, worked on journals and cleaned up. About 6:30pm we headed out looking for food. After eating we stopped by the Giant grocery store and finished off any resupply that we needed.  Back at the room we repacked our food bags and the put all our stuff back in our packs, cause tomorrow it's back to full packing it.

Congratulations, high fives all around cause we have made it to the three months mark. In that three months there have been many many accomplishments. We have made it through Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and now we're in Pennsylvania. We are past the halfway point and still headed north. I want to thank all of you that are following me for the encouragement, prayers and support. You have no way of knowing how wonderful and encouraging it is for me knowing that you are there for me. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
I slept in till 6:40 this morning and didn't get out of bed till 7am, but once up it was get ready, eat, and recheck my pack so we could be on way by 8am. We walked from the hotel down the highway about a half mile and back into the woods we went. About a mile later we had stopped at a help yourself honor system building that had all kinds of goodies. After snacks we moved on. We spent some time in fields again today but most of the time we were in the woods. We even had some boardwalks today. 
 
We popped out of the woods at one point into a grassy field with these really pretty purple flowers. Another beautiful field. Just as I was getting close to the end of the field and going to cross a road, there was a sign that read Drinks and Snacks with an arrow pointing left. I immediately turned left and went to see if this was real. Sure enough there were ice cold Gatorades, peanut butter sandwiches, Halos, cheese sticks and chips. No one was around to thank for the trail magic,  but to you anonymous Trail Angel I say thank you very much. 
 
We finished up the fields for the day and traded them for the woods and a couple of nice long steep rocky climbs. We were in full locomotive mode by the time we reached the top. Along the way we crossed paths with two rather large black snakes. Finally we reached the Cove Mountain Shelter. It has four bunks and some space for two or three on the floor. It also has a sign out front telling about the porcupines that are regular visitors. I'm hopeful we'll see one. The piped spring is down a very steep hill so I'm hopeful my three liters will see me through the morning. Tomorrow we will hike about three miles into Duncanon where Johnny Bravo will start his journey back home and we will eat, resupply and head out for a few more miles. About 5:30pm it was time for my dinner of Spam singles and cheese crackers. Now thats some fine eating. It won't be long now till I'm in the sack.

Up this morning about 6:30am as one of our shelter mates ""Rumpled"" decided that we needed a fire this morning.  We all got busy with our chores and by 8 am we were on our way.
Today we had a short walk into Duncanon to get Johnny Bravo connected up with his shuttle as he is headed home. Johnny we really enjoyed your visit and you brought us nice trails and trail magic. It was my pleasure to meet you and hike with you. 
Before we got to Duncanon we enjoyed a lovely view and some good rock scrambles. Then we strolled into town and stopped at the first quick stop we came to. Some resupply took place but we all got a cold drink as today was warming up. Next it was up the street to Kind of Outdoorsy the local outfitters so the Johnny Bravo could shower before his trip home. I finished my resupply and charged some of my electronics while we waited. 
We then met Johnny Bravos shuttle driver and got him on his way home. We went into Doyle Hotel for a burger and fries, another one of the AT trail things I didn't want to miss. It was a great burger! After that we were walking through town across bridges, over the railroad tracks and into the woods. We immediately had a tough climb and by then it was 87 degrees and we were drenched by the time we reached the top. We enjoyed several views as we scrambled over and around the big boulders. Even in the heat it was fun when we hit the scrambles. 
As I was crossing over the Peter's Road on the foot bridge I noticed a couple of cars with their lifts open.  Then a man said can I get you something cold to drink. Absolutely! So, I had three cold pops, an orange, a banana, twizlers, and crackers. The Trail Angel was Twizler himself.  Thank you very much for the food and the fun conversation. And you were at a great spot on a hot day.
From there it was a short three miles to the Peter's Mountain Shelter where we grabbed some of the last spots. The water source is a nice spring a long way down a steep decline. The water is good the hike up was not. Once up I ate my dinner brushed my teeth and worked on my journal. There are some new friends Mika, Oreo, along with Catdorito, Four Low, and Maps our old friends. Lots of fun conversation and laughter tonight.

We were up very early this morning as someones alarm went off at 5am and people started stirring. Which means by 6:45am I was headed north.  JFK was already north bound and McDuck was just a few minutes away from departure. 
The trail was pretty nice early on this morning and about three miles in there was a nice view called Kinter view. I stopped there for a few moments enjoying the views and the peace and quiet. From there the trail did several little ups and downs until we dropped about 700 feet down to a road. No trail magic today. Then we had the privilege of climbing about 1100 feet to the top of the next mountain. The grade wasn't too bad and again the rocks were mostly tolerable. From there it was just hiking miles until we made it to Rausch Shelter. It's a small shelter but the water is very close, maybe 20 feet away.  Yea for close water. After a couple of days of sweating we took advantage of the close water and took a rag bath. Slightly chilling but very refreshing. Then some of us decided it was nap time. 
A short time later Catdorito and Four Low strolled in and the shelter was full.  There was much visiting some eating and lots of laughing as we did our best to stay up till after 6pm.

Once again we were up by 5:30am but some of us hung in our bags till 6am. There was a lovely thunderstorms during the evening and into the night. Not one of those big loud windy ones but the distant rolling thunders and some moderate rain.  We were all nice and dry in the shelter. The air cooled down and I slept more gooder.
By 7am we were on trail as a group cause at the end of mile one was the dreaded beaver dam. Its billed as 150 yards of flooded creek where beavers have built a dam. It looks much like a shallow creek that's out of its banks.  We all successfully crossed on the various logs and sticks placed there by man and beast. No one got their foot wet or very muddy in the making of this crossing.  Then the hiking began.  There were some ups and there were some downs with a big down to the Swatara River where the big Berlin Iron Bridge resides. Shortly after that we enjoyed a very nice 1000 ft climb. Once on top we stayed on top with the occasional rock garden to hopp through. JFK and McDuck headed on as I stopped to work on a problem shoe so for the last six or so miles I was pretty much by my self. 
I found the shelter about 3:45pm and I had it all to myself so I picked out my bunk for the night and then started exploring the place.  I  found the water, privy and electrical outlets for charging my stuff.  I quickly got stuff charging and then filled up my water bottle and sat down to chill for a bit. It wasn't long before Catdorito showed up and then Maps, followed shortly by McDuck, JFK, and Four Low. All but JFK picked a bunk and he pitched his tent. Food was on everyones mind as we passed around the menu from the pizza place. JFK placed the order and the rest of us impatiently waited for delivery. Let's just say that once the food arrived it got very quiet. Everyone ordered more than they could eat tonight which means there will be good food for breakfast and we all have a sandwich to pack out. Later Nero, a new hiker to us showed up and helped us eat some of the leftovers.  Then it was journal time and soon to follow hiker midnight.

I first heard noise about 5:30AM But I rolled over and was out till 6:45am. That was bonus sleep. The crew began stirring and up I got. Once ready I sat down and finished my stromboli from last night and then ate my 9 inch sub. Needless to say when it was time to hike I waddled. Around 8am we were off looking for the 1200 mile mark which we found in just a few miles.  That leaves us under 1000 miles to Katadyn, 987.1 miles if my math is any good. That seems pretty crazy to me. Anyway there were pictures and fist bumps all around. 
 
As we continued our hike we enjoyed a couple of views of the valley and farm land. Then we made it to the Hertline creek and filled us and our water bottles with water. McDuck and JFK went on down to look at a swimming hole and I headed on up the hill. It wasn't long before they had caught  up with me. We hiked along together for a time and came upon the Fort Dietrich Memorial from 1755. Not long after that was the PA Route 183 crossing. We have experienced recently how dangerous road crossings can be and today's was no different. Four lanes of traffic a curve to the right and a hill to the left, so you can't see what's coming. All you can do is 
run when you don't see any cars. Run we did. Just another way to find entertainment. 
Then the trail took us through  a prescribed burn area where all the underbrush was burned away.  Don't worry none of the rocks were burned. It was a .3 walk to this shelter and there was room in the inn for me. I set up hiked back down to where water was. McDuck scooped up enough water to fill all three bags and three liter bottles. We rested a bit after that and that's when Maps, Catdorito, and Four Low come into camp. The two ladies set up tents and Maps joined us in the shelter. I'm beginning to think we may stink and that's why the ladies are tenting. 
Around 5pm we start on our supper everyone deciding what they can and should eat and what needs to be saved for another day. We have a resupply tomorrow so I was just organizing and deciding what I would need. By 6:30pm we all begin to look for our bags. Eventually we got the food bags hung, journals completed and to bed we went. 
Today we hiked 14.9 miles,  37,254 steps, low 52° high 72°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Windsor Furnace Shelter 1226.0 about 15 miles.

Slept in till 6:30am this morning and that was nice. I felt rested and thats a good feeling. I was ready to go about 7:45am so off I went.  It wasn't long at all when the train of people passed me by. I think the only two that didn't were Four Low and Maps, and Maps blew by me just a little bit later.  
For the first eleven miles today I hiked by myself.  I've done a bit more of that in the last few days. I didn't care much for it at first but I'm beginning to enjoy the solace.  Again today I enjoyed the Mountain Laurel blooming all around.  About six miles in I came to the first view for the day, it was not spectacular but enjoyable. They are telling us that the haze in our views is smoke from fires in Canada. Who knew? Right at that view spot was a little carved statue.  Hopefully I can include a picture here, if not it will be in the photo album. 
 
Then I hiked on till the trail descended sharply down to the railroad tracks of Port Clinton. I would sure hate to have to climb that. Walked on into Port Clinton and found JFK waiting at the Fire Department. McDuck had made his way to a Peanut/Candy store and soon returned with sweet goodies. He twisted my arm until I ate some of it. JFK had arranged for a shuttle to Hamburg for all of us to resupply. We, McDuck, JFK, Four Low, Catdorito, Ozzie, Maps, and me all shuttled over to the Walmart for resupply and lunch. It was fairly entertaining watching the people of Walmart watch us, especially as we congregated at the Subway in the store consuming large quantities of food. 
I was in the first shuttle back to Port Clinton so I started the afternoon hike with Ozzie who is from Germany.  We had some nice conversation until the big climb started for us. It was 1100 ft of up. I'm sure glad I had that footlong sub to fuel the climb. It wasn't long after that when the thunder started and then not long again till the rain started. I whooped out my trusty umbrella and kept the top half of me mostly dry. The rain might have lasted ten or fifteen minutes at most. Not near enough for what this area is in need of.
It had been suggested by the shuttle driver that we get our water at the creek around .3 before the shelter and as I was doing so McDuck and JFK arrived. We all got our water and found our way to the Windsor Furnace Shelter and again there was room in the shelter so we claimed a spot.
There was a young man from the Chec Republic I believe, here when we arrived named Shauma. He was lots of fun for the short while he was around. The rest of group rolled in over time and dinner began to be served. During and after dinner we enjoyed the conversation and laughter that this group is known for.
Today we hiked 14.7 miles, 37,916 steps,  low 55° high 78°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Allentown Hiking Club Shelter mile 1242.5 for 16.5 miles.

Slept until 6:15am this morning after a restless night. Did all my morning chores and was on trail near 7am. Nice to know that if I needed to I can get moving pretty quickly. 
First up today was the Pulpit Rock view. With all of the smoke in the air from the Canada fires there are no views. It just looks like fog. Next was the Pinnacle view and it was similar to the first view, a smoke out. McDuck and JFK caught up with me there and from there we walked along a road for awhile. 
We hiked along skipping the next view but stopping briefly at Balanced Rock view so McDuck could make the balanced rock wiggle. The story for today other than the smoke and how strange it made the sunshine look, was the rocks. We had long sections of big boulders that you needed to hop from one to another to work your way through that section. Then it would immediately change to the little rocks that you would try to avoid stepping on. And sometimes the rocks would be in-between sizes and you didn't know whether to step on them or avoid them. 
Needless to say by the end of the day our feet and brains were tired. We were very happy when we saw the sign for the shelter. The shelter we are in is another good one, a little odd configuration but we are inside. 
Today we hiked 16.5 miles, 41,972 steps, low 55° high 66°. Tomorrow we are aiming for PA Route 309 mile 1246.6 or 4.1 miles. There we'll go to the Lookout Hostel drop our packs and the head for a hotel, cause tomorrow McDuck and I are headed to NYC and JFK is heading to Montana for a few days.

Day 100! Can you believe we've been hiking this trai for 100 days. It is hard for me to wrap my little brain around it. As a whole it has been marvelous even if a few of those days were tough. Looking forward to the days ahead and to all the places we will see and the people we will meet.  Thanks again so much for joining me on this crazy journey. 
It was 7am before I opened my eyes this morning after a restful night's sleep. As I looked around I noticed we had a new addition to the shelter. Some time during the night a young man named Piper had taken up a spot. I slept good enough not to know he had arrived.
We were on trail by 8:15 after saying farewell to Ozzie, hopefully we'll see him again up trail. Then with a new days motivation we started hiking the four miles to the Lookout Hostel. There we would shower, wash our clothes, and resupply. The trail was mostly kind to us for that four miles and my feet were thankful. We each thought that the smoke in the air was less this morning than yesterday. When we arrived at the Lookout Hostel we were warmly greeted by Four Low, Maps, and Catdorito. Maps and Four Low soon headed out but Catdorito had decided to take a zero inside because of the smoke in the air.
Chores done and bodies cleaned we packed up what we were taking to NYC and put the rest in our backpacks which will be residing in a storage closet at the hostel. Then we waited for our shuttle driver to take us to Allentown. He arrived about twenty minutes early so we did the hustle and got ourselves ready. The ride into Allentown was entertaining and soon we were deposited at our hotel. Check in was quick and easy and after dropping our stuff in the room we walked over to the Red Robin for a burger. Yum yum it was tasty. 
Back to the room it was nap time. Then about 7pm we headed out to find a Texas Roadhouse, yes to eat at, but more importantly to see how many rolls McDuck would consume. The previous record was seven and yes I said previous because there is a new record. You'll have to ask McDuck what that new number is. Back to the room it was way past my bedtime so I got busy and got to bed. Early travel day for all of us. JFK heading west and McDuck and I east. 
Today we hiked 4.1 miles 10,742 steps, low 52° high 57°. Tomorrow we are aiming for a bus and a train to NYC.

Up at 6am this morning cause we have travel plans.  JFK very very quietly was up and gone before 5:30am as his trip takes him easterly bound. McDuck and I were picked up by the hotel shuttle at 7am and then nearly dropped off at the airport. McDuck suggested to our driver that the bus stop was more our style so, we went downtown Allentown to the bus stop. Our driver wasn't sure exactly where we were to be but a fine young gentleman recognized a lost old man and asked if I needed help and then expertly directed us to our bus pickup spot. 
It was just moments later the bus came and a nice group of us got on for the trip to Philadelphia or Philly as the locals refer to it. It was something over an hours ride to the Amtrack station in Philly which by the way is a big station. We soon located our train gate and waited for boarding. Our wait wasn't long before the man said boarding gate three track four and down into the trainlands we went. We boarded got comfi in the nice plush seats and soon we pulled away, and I'm going hold on here I did not hear, All Aboard. What kind of train operation is this? Anyway, we eventually arrived at the Penn Station in New York safely and found our way up to street level. 
From that point on it was entertaining any where you looked. I had a difficult time walking the half mile to our hotel because I was so busy gawking at everything. It wasn't long before Angela made it and we checked in got to our rooms and then shortly we were back on the street looking for food. We found a nice deli and I enjoyed a Reuben and a strawberry malt. Yum yum! 
Next we journeyed over to Rockefeller Center, toured St Patrick's Cathedral saw the Radio Center Music Hall near there and walked to Central Park and through a small section of it. Then we headed on back to the hotel seeing several other places that one reads or hears about. We took about an hour and a half break before we headed out looking for food again. This time we tried a food truck and it was good. We continued on down to 44th Street where the theater was for our show tonight. I really really enjoyed A Beautiful Noise the Neal Diamond story.  I  got to sing along to all of the songs. It was a fabulous musical! I can't wait to see it again. 
 
Then we walked back to the hotel on a really nice evening and I continued to be amazed at the people out and the activities going strong. The city that doesn't sleep. Back to the hotel we stopped in the upstairs restaurant that overlooks Time Square and had a late night snack. The Square is absolutely working alive. Eventually I threw in the towel cause I was sleepy.
 
Today we hiked 0 miles, 14,474 steps. Tomorrow we are aiming for more sightseeing in NYC.

Yes, the alarm woke me up at 8:20am this morning. Late nights in New York require late mornings. Around 9:30am we headed out to take the Staton Island Ferry to Staton Island. In order to get from our hotel to the ferry we rode the subway. That McDuck,  he can find his way around anywhere he is. Arriving in the ferry area we stopped at a little cafe and had us some breakfast.  Then we hopped on the Ferry rode it over to the island got off walked around to the getting back on spot and rode the ferry back. I took several pictures of the Statue of Liberty, New York sky line, and bridges. 
Next we stopped and each of us got a Nathan dog, which is a famous New York hot dog. Then it was on to the 9/11 Memorial. We were introduced to a man that was there the day the buildings were hit and he showed us lots of pictures and told a little of that day while he tried to sell us a magazine. From there we purchased The Big bus hop on hop off tickets and soon hopped on one for a city tour. It was fun riding and hearing about New York while still being able to people watch. We hopped off near Times Square walked down and listened to a Christian group sing right there on the Square. We were ready for a break so up to the room we went for about 30 minutes and then it was back out to hop on the bus for more tour while using it as a ride to Little Italy and some Italian food.  Oh so good! And, when we were through one of the managers brought us out a plate of Tiramasu. Very nice and very tasty. 
After dinner we walked the streets for a bit until McDuck found the Museum of Ice Cream, yes it's a real place, and then went back down and rode the subway back to our hotel. That gave us about 30 minutes to freshen up before we go see MJ the Musical. Another really good Broadway show, so much energy, great dancing and music. Then a walk back to the hotel still amazed at the people and activity going on the streets and in Time Square. We stopped again at the restaurant overlooking Time Square and had late watched the crowds. It started raining and the crowds began to disperse and that ment it was bed time for me. 
Today we hiked zero miles, 11,178 steps. Tomorrow we have a little more time in NYC before boarding the train and bus back to Allentown.

About 8:30am I was awake so up I got, I cleaned up, packed up and got myself ready for today. When we made it to the street it was once again food time. We found a deli not far away and I had a breakfast burrito. Not the best, but food for a hungry tummy. 
Then we wandered the streets a block or two before deciding to head over to the  Rockefeller Center. From there we discovered that they were having a Puerto Rican day parade and we stopped and watched a portion of it. Then we headed back towards the hotel stopping to get our picture made with a bearded soldier. 
As we neared the hotel McDuck spotted a Nathan dog stand so of course we had to have one. We sat one last time in Times Square and ate the dogs. Back to the hotel to get our bags and to get ready for our journey's, Angela would be flying out and a little later we would train out. Soon we said by to Angela and decided to hop the subway to China Town for some Chinese food before we headed to the train station. We found a nice place in China Town and enjoyed a delicious meal. Then very skillfully we hopped on the subway that took us near the Penn Station where we catch the train to Philly. In just a short few minutes we were boarding the train. I waited with great anticipation on hearing those famous words, All Aboard! Once again to my great disappointment they were not uttered.  So sad. We arrived safely in Philly and had about an hour and a half wait for the bus so we explored the station, we were really looking for food, and then found a nice wooden bench to sit upon until it was bus time. The bus was right on time and we were off to Allentown. I snuck in a nap on the bus ride back to Allentown and that helped get me part of the way over those New York late nights. McDuck got us an Uber to Target for a resupply and then we crossed the parking lot for  burger. After that it was a short ride to the hotel. 
I had a fantastic time in New York. The sights and sounds were awesome. We ate some really good food and saw two great shows. Special thanks goes to McDuck and Angela for showing me all the things and places I wanted to see and several more that I didn't know I wanted to see. That was a great time!
Today we hiked zero miles, 12,156 steps. Tomorrow we are aiming for the Lookout Hostel and then on to possibly the George W Outerbridge Shelter about 14 miles.

It was after 7 when I stirred this morning, JFK and McDuck were already up. I quickly got dressed and headed down for breakfast. After a quick breakfast the shuttle driver showed up and off to the Lookout Hostel we went. We retrieved our bags and completed the repacking process. Once completed we headed out the door and by 10am we were on trail. The first challenge was to get safely across the highway.  When you looked right you could see plenty of distance but when you looked left there was a hill. So, once again we waited until it seemed quiet and made the sprint across. The trail was not so bad this morning there were short sections of the little rocks and a few sections of big boulder climb/scrambles that were enjoyable. We also had a a few view spots. There remains a goodly amount of smoke in the air up here which is evident in my pictures. I could also smell the smoke again today. 
A few miles into our hike this morning is when it happened. We were walking and visiting when I head something and said stranger danger. That's what we say to let each other know we see another person. So, back to me saying stranger danger, when around the bend came the Behr's. There was a mom and three cubs. They just kept right on up to us and we stopped and had a real nice visit. They were out for a day hike and were very interested in our thru hike. After a nice visit the Behr's and their two relatives went south and we continued north.
There were a few more of the big boulder climb/scrambles and a few more views as the day went on and at one point we had extended views as we hiked the side of the mountain with Palmerton way down below on our left. We did have rain today for a couple of hours which was sufficient to get us good and wet. I deployed my umbrella and kept my head and shoulders mostly dry but with the heat and hiking I was wet through and through with sweat. When we reached the shelter we quickly completed our chores so we could be done when more rain moved in, I was very happy to get my wet socks and undies off, along with the other wet stuff. 
There is a section hiker here tonight that goes by the name Uhaul. He is meeting up with a friend tomorrow as they work on completing another section of the trail. We visited ate snacks and worked on journals as we made every effort not to eat dinner early and then be ready for bed by 6:30pm. The rain did start again so we are tucked back in the shelter staying dry. Finally about 6pm we started consuming groceries and it was hard not to eat today's and tomorrows food. Yogi, another thru hiker stopped in and ate then packed up and moved on about 6:45pm. He says he's moving slow but lots of hours each day. I just move slow. 
We eventually got the food bags hung and crawled into our bags to let the rain sing us to sleep.

Up just after 7am and on trail by about 8am. We had a short downhill to Palmerton where we crossed the Lehigh River and then had the pleasure of dashing across another highway.  Then it was up hill time.  We climbed up 1000 feet much of which was over a big boulder scramble. It probably was the most fun section of the AT for me thus far. Then as we continued hiking the ridge we got excellent views on our right of the valley and when the trail took us to the other side of the mountain we had great views of Palmerton and the Lehigh river.
 
As we continued hiking we walked under a big power line where several day hikers were gathered and found that they were enjoying blueberries. So as any polite hiker would do we joined in and had a few blueberries. On we went doing our best with whatever the trail brought to us and around 1:45pm we began a downhill section to the Blue Mountain Road.  We had read that there would be trail magic beginning at 7:30am. Since it was getting late in the day we were hopeful but somewhat doubtful that they would still be there. As we neared the road we saw a cache of water that we were very much in need of. When we heard and saw more activities in the parking lot. Trail Magic! Is what we shouted.  
 
HR 15, Woodstock,  and another fine gentleman provided us with hotdogs, drinks, veggies, bananas, halos, chips, cookies, and a charge for our phones. It was one of those days when trail magic makes the difference between a rough day and a good day. Thank you so very much for being kind to complete strangers. 
Our batteries charged both phones and bodies, we set out again. We had three and a half miles left to get to the Leroy A Smith Shelter our home for the night. Other than rocky, the trail there wasn't bad. We arrived and found a young man trail name Cowboy already set up and laying down. We got out our stuff and claimed spots then headed way down for water. We discussed that the young man was a little odd as we gathered water but chocked it up to bring on trail. When we got back with our water McDuck called his folks and JFK and I sat at the shelter. Cowboy began having very strange conversations with no one in particular and the longer we sat there the more sure we were that he was not stable. So when McDuck got off the phone we packed up our stuff and headed north. Another good decision by us. We talked about some camping options but ended up hiking about four and a half more miles to The Gateway Motel a fine hiker motel. 
JFK had called and was told they had one room with one bed but, he could put a mattress on the floor. As we walked into the office we were warmly greeted by Satish the caretaker. He insisted that we sit down, asked if we wanted a drink and proceeded to wash three glasses in the shower for us to use. We each got a little ice and then he poured us a glass full of coke. We discussed JFK tenting in the yard and Satish sent him out to set up. McDuck and I were given a tour of the room and then helped move the furniture so that a mattress could be brought in and put on the floor. Back to the office we went while Satish and his helper ""cleaned"" the room and brought in the mattress. Next were the several trips to and from the office in an attempt to procure sheets, pillow cases, blankets  and towels. On his final trip Satish brought us some body wash and a copy of a prayer or meditation. Once we had the room to ourselves we quickly began to eat and work on our journals and shower as it was already after 9pm. Tomorrow I've got family coming in and I can't wait to see them.

I was up just before 7am after an excellent night's rest at the luxurious Gateway Motel. We completed our morning chores and were on trail by 8am. Our first order of business was to cross another busy highway.
 Successfully done we entered the woods and began our first good climb of about 500 feet. The trail was Pennsylvania normal with lots of rocks to hop. Around 10:30 the rain started and I deployed my umbrella. With it deployed being able to look up becomes more challenging as instead of seeing the trail you see umbrella. We came upon a big slab boulder scramble and I quickly found out how slick the slab rock was as down I went. I got up checked me out I was fine and the rock looked OK also. I kept going being more carefuller when I raised up my umbrella to see where to go and stepped towards a rock at the same time and down I went again. And again no one was injured in the making of this fall. I also made a note to self not to step when looking for direction to go. The rest of the hike was pretty normal other than the rain which stayed with us till 1:30pm. We made our final decent into Delaware Water Gap hiked through part of the town and onto the bridge. We stopped and took pictures and celebrated with fist bumps crossing into New Jersey our 8th state. No sooner had we crossed the bridge and made it to the trail head parking and got under the pavilion, the skies opened up and the rain fell. We were nice and dry under the pavilion. 
We heard from Scott and Sarah that they were a few minutes away from the Airbnb and would unload then come and get us. As we were waiting a group of thru hikers came up to the pavilion to get out of the rain.  They were Stairmaster, Bobsled, and North Star. We visited just a bit before they were off hiking again. Scott and Gorgeous came driving up about 5:30 to rescue us from the elements. Then off to Vernon New Jersey we went. We arrived about 6:30 to a big house with a delicious food smell. We were soon at the table eating lasagna, bread and salad. It must have been an all you can eat kind of deal cause I ate all I could. Afterwards some of us went for the most important meal of the day, ice cream. We also stopped for a few snacks while we hike the next day or two. Then back to the house for a good night's sleep.

Up just before my alarm went off at 7am. Got myself ready and down for breakfast. The house was a buzz with grandchildren activity.  I think they were supposed to be eating breakfast but other things were distracting them.  Soon we were off in search of our starting spot for today. Once we found it they kicked us out and we started hiking south. 
The trail was very nice for the 1st mile or so this morning before it remembered that it was supposed to have rocks on it. There were many many great views throughout the day, we could look west and we were viewing Pennsylvania, and when we could look east we saw New Jersey. At one point on Raccoon Ridge you could look out and see both Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Absolutely spectacular! We could see the Delaware River and the beautiful valley with it. Since we were hiking south bound today we met up with several hikers we new and a few new ones to us. We stopped at the Mohican Outdoor Center just after noontime for a really tasty sandwich. 
At one point we saw a very fresh pile of bear scat right on trail. JFK said I bet we're just behind the bear. He's such a funny guy. While walking a fire road around the bend came a guy with a leaf blower, blowing the gravel road. I'm not making this up.. He told us that a vehicle was coming down the road.  Sure enough a pickup came down with a couple of guys in it. They worked the fire tower and were out doing chores and told us if we wanted we could climb the fire tower. So we did and the views were outstanding. 
 
 
 
The big news for today is we crossed the 1300 mile mark. Phones came out for pictures and fist bumps all around. If my math is any good after today there remains 883.6 miles till Katadyn. As we approached the end of our hike today out comes these sweet ladies with a sign telling us about trail magic. What a great way to end the day with a cold Gatorade and all kinds of snacks. Thanks to Gorgeous, Sister, and Lucy Goosie for the goodies. Back at the house we ordered in sushi and boy was it ever good. Now I'm showered, fed  and journaled, time for bed.
 
Now that we're in New Jersey some of my memories of Pennsylvania are, great parks, trail magic, the most fun section climbing out of Palmerton and rocks.

My 7am alarm woke me up this morning, I was snoozing really good. I got dressed and headed down to blueberry pancakes and bacon for breakfast. Yum yum. About 8am we loaded up and Scott drove us to our starting spot at Blue Mountain Lake Road. By 9:15am we were headed north on the trail.
Today the trail had sections much like in Pennsylvania and the occasional really nice section. Again today the Mountain Laurel was blooming beautifully in large sections of the hike. Most of it is white blooms, but occasionally there will be a pink one. We hiked on to the top of Rattlesnake Mountain where we had some great views of the Delaware River Valley and in the distance are the Pocono Mountains. Sometime later we had made it to a rocky ridge with views of Culver's Lake and that valley. 
Then when we were about a mile from our pickup spot the thunder rolled and the rain began. Fortunately we were through with the rock slabs for the day so no slippy falley for me. In no time we had made it to our next road crossing.  It was a very busy one, however, you could see a good distance either direction and eventually we crossed the road. It was a short walk to the parking lot and a short wait for our ride. Scott loaded us up and brought us safely back to the house. 
Back at the house I changed into dry clothes and fixed a sandwich. I also enjoyed some cherries that my mother-in-law sent for me. Oh were they good! Then it was mandatory nap time, at least for the hikers amongst us. After naps Scott had built a fire out in the fire pit for us to enjoy while we waited for the gourmet burgers to get cooked. If you made a happy plate you got a slice of coconut cream pie, still warm. Double Yum yum! 
After dinner we sat out around the fire for a while enjoying the evening. By 8:30pm we were looking for showers and bed.

Up before my alarm went off again this morning, and down for breakfast I went. My sweet wife fixed me eggs and toast. Yum. By 7:30am we were out the door headed out to Culver's Gap our starting place for today. Upon arrival out came the hikers, all five of us. You see today Scott and Sarah are joining us for the hike. 
Away we went into the woods while Gorgeous, Lucy Goosie and Rosco all went on their own adventures. It didn't take long for our first view. It was a good one except for the haze. Next we came upon the fire tower and enjoyed the view from there. We didn't get to climb this one. So sad.
Then after a bit there was another outcropping with a nice view of the valley. Then we made it to the top of Sunrise Mountain one of the tallest mountains in New Jersey. We had views off both sides. As we hiked on we arrived at a gas line crossing not known for their views but this one had a good view with a house nearby. Next we stopped at the Rutherford Shelter for a quick snack break. At this point in the day we decided to push on another five miles or so.
After crossing the Deckertown Turnpike without incident we entered the woods again. There were a couple more view spots, several rock slabs to cross, thankfully it was dry today. I think the most notable part of this section was the return of the rocks. There was also a couple of nice climbs and one series downhill full of rocks. At about 2:30pm we popped out of the woods at the High Point State Park HQ our pickup spot for today. 
Then it was off to Texas Roadhouse for lunch. After lunch we stopped by the grocery store for a few supplies and then, yes we did, we found a DQ for ice cream.

Happy Father's day to all you fathers out there and especially to my father Big O. Thank you dad for a lifetime of love and support, teaching me to look for the adventure in every day and showing me how important it is to to serve God.
This morning it was almost 7:30 before I crawled out of my nice soft bed. The Stewart family had gone out to retrieve donuts for breakfast this morning and they returned shortly with a smorgasbord of donuts. Yum Yum. 
After breakfast we gathered upstairs for a time of worship with the McDermott Road church. It was very uplifting and encouraging. After that it was free time for all except Gorgeous and Sarah who went to work on our fathers day lunch. Man did they do it right. We had tender chicken fried steak, smashed taters, gravy, green peas, shrimp scampi, and black forrest cheesecake. You talk about good, I ate till I was stuffed. And what do you do after a big meal and you're full. One takes a nice long nap, so I did.
After naps we had more free time to relax and alow our bodies to heal up some. The day was beautiful and we sat outside and told stories on each other and remembered days gone by. The grandchildren provided lots of entertainment for the afternoon. Then it was time for supper and tonight it was hotdogs. Scott built us another fire and we enjoyed the hotdogs and fun conversation on a really nice evening. 
Today we hiked zero miles, tomorrow we are aiming for County Road 517 mile 1358 for 18.2 miles.

Up at 6am as we wanted to get an earlier start since we were hiking bigger miles. I got breakfast eaten and we were all ready to go by 7am. The Stewart's and Gorgeous were hiking up to the Monument on top of Hightop mountain, while JFK, McDuck and me stayed with the AT trail. 
While the group was all together we came upon the wooden observation deck for viewing High Point Monument. Then shortly after that the trail split and their trail went up to the monument and our trail continued off another direction. We hiked on with the trail switching from nice to rocky and back again throughout the day. Around mile seven we found a good creek and drank down a liter of water and refilled. It would be our last water source for awhile. 
We hiked on walking through some pasture land and crossing several roads when we came to NJ Route 284 and as we started across the road, 30 yards up the road a bear came out of the woods onto the road. As I turned to get McDuck's attention JFK hollers bear. The bear took a good look at us and scampered across the road over the guardrail paused for a second and into the woods it went. I didn't get my phone camera on in time for a picture but McDuck did and that gives us picture evidence of the bear. We husseled into the woods the direction the bear went and caught a glimpse of it again as it moved through the forest. Then it was celebration time, we have now seen a bear.
 We made it to State Line Road and as we were walking down it when we spotted Trail Magic. In someone's front yard there was a small refrigerator with cold drinks, and a few snacks. Again, it just blows me away that these trail Angels would go to the trouble and effort to provide complete strangers with those goodies. Thank you very much!
From there we hit a very flat stretch that worked around a wetlands area. We decided that it was really a Federal Mosquito raising facility. Eventually we were back in the woods and soon were challenged with a 600 ft rocky climb followed by a brief flat spot followed by another 600 foot very rocky climb. The second climb got me breathing like a locomotive. Then it was mostly downhill from there to our pickup spot.  One road before being picked up JFK spotted another bear. He said as soon as it saw us it was gone. I heard it running through the forest but never saw it.
As we arrived at the pickup road we were surprised by more trail magic. Gorgeous and Sarah had cold drinks and snacks ready for us. Thank you for the trail magic. We made it back to the house where we got cleaned up and were out the door headed for pizza.  After pizza we found the local DQ for Ice cream. You know I've heard somewhere that ice cream is the most important meal of the day. 
Back to the house I worked on my journal, visited, and played with the grandkids.  We also took a moment to call my dad and wish him a happy 89th birthday. By 7pm we were beginning to get sleepy and it wasn't long before we started to  our bedrooms.

The alarm woke me up this morning cause I was still tired. I got up got ready and got breakfast before I got in the car about 7am to head for the trail. We all hiked the initial part of the trail this morning which was a .8 mile boardwalk. When it ended the three of us continued on and the others turned back for their day of adventure. 
We hiked along on pretty flat terrain until we got to the base of Stairway to Heaven. It was an 1100 foot climb over boulders and rocks. I never got to full locomotive on this climb cause I took it fairly easy. We hiked on sometimes on easy trail sometimes on rocky trail, but overall it was pretty good trail this morning. About 10 miles in I stopped for a water refill. Shortly after that was the big event for today, the New Jersey/New York state line. As usual there were pictures and fist bumps. Near there we paused because on a clear day you can see the New York City skyline.  I couldn't make it out today. 
For the next few miles we scrambled over big slabs of rock as we followed a ridge line. Off to our right was a beautiful lake, Greenwood Lake and every so often you could see boats out on the lake. Finally the trail brought us back into the forest and we continued the nice trail rocky trail trade off. Near 3pm we came to our pickup spot for the day and to our favorite trail magic and trail Angels. Then we loaded up and went the 3 blocks to Bellvale Creamery where, yes we did,  we got ice cream. Yum yum. 

From there it was back to the house to get bodies cleaned up before we go find something to eat. Around 6pm we made our way to a local diner and had a very tasty dinner. After that we stopped by the grocery store to finish off our resupply. Back to the house it was work on journal, start repacking backpack and get ready for bed.

Up just before 7:30am since we would have a late start today.  McDuck has a meeting to attend this morning and we would leave as soon as that was over. Breakfast for me was 2 eggs, 4 pancakes some cherries and bacon. After that I finished loading up my pack and played with grandchildren. 
Then the hard stuff began. Saying goodbye to Scott, Sarah and the kids and then Gorgeous was really hard this time. For the first time on this journey I didn't want to go today. Many many thanks to Scott Sarah and Gorgeous for the week together. I had a Grand time and wished it didn't have to end. Gorgeous I already miss you a bunch. 
Then the hiking began and for today we climbed over 4000 feet. There were lots of big slab rocks to negotiate and many rock scrambles. More than once we would toss our poles up the rocks and hand climb a section. Water was another hard thing for us today.  Creek after creek was dry and if it hadn't been for a Trail Angel that left a cache of water just at the right place we would have been drinking stagnant pond water. Thank you Trail Angel. The water source at the shelter we were headed to was dry so we got water about 3 miles before the shelter and carried it. That's about 4 pounds extra.
Today was also the day for the Lemon Sqeezer. It is a very tight squeeze between two huge slabs of rock. One of the novelty things on trail. We all squeezed through. 
We continued the rock scrambles up and down until we reached the shelter for tonight, Fingerboard Shelter. I was one beat hiker when we finally arrived. I fed me, put on dry clothes and worked on the journal before crawling in my bag.
Today we hiked 16.6 miles, 40,689 steps, low 68° high 77°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Hemlock Springs Campsite about 20 miles.

First sign of morning for me was about 7:15am when I opened my eyes to see it was daylight.  Up I came and got busy with the morning chores and by 7:45am I was on trail. 
Today was another big mile day with lots of good stuff packed in. First was the Lake Tiorati State Park. It was just a short way off trail but it had water and restrooms. Next it was the 1400 mile mark. Pictures and fist bumps all around and we got to share the moment with Good Soup a fellow thru hiker. There was some disagreement as to the correct spot, but whichever is correct we have completed over 1400 miles of this trail. That leaves us with 785.7 to go. Go Team!The next bit of excitement came when we crossed the Palisades Interstate Parkway. I'll just say it was a little nerve racking. Then came the views including the view from Bear Mountain. We could see the New York City skyline, the Hudson River and some of West Point. After that we came down 1150 feet mostly by rock steps to the Trailside Zoo. It's a small zoo with not many critters in it, but another one of those iconic things I've wanted to do on trail. 
 
After that came the crossing of the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge. The bridge is celebrating 100 years of existence this year. Then we had a bit of road walk before entering the woods again and another big climb. Finally we reached the spot for tents and each of us picked out a spot and set up. I applaud the trail builders in New York. There have been lots and lots of rock stair steps both uphill and down the last couple of days. It is impressive the amount of work that went into building these rock stairs. 
 
Today we hiked 20.6 miles, 47,271 steps, low 66° high 73°. Tomorrow I'm not sure where McDuck and JFK are aiming,  but I will be aiming for Canopus Beach Shelter mile 1430.7 about 18 miles.

I heard rustling outside my tent about 6:30am after a good night's sleep, so I got up and got around which put me on trail by 7:20am. The rustling was JFK not a bear. About 3.5 miles ahead of us was The Appalachian Market and they have a grill. Yes we did, I had a foot long bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and got two more days of resupply. I also drank most of a liter of water and refilled my bottle. I'll call that a success!
I headed out a few minutes before the other two and that gave me a couple of hours to myself which I enjoyed. There was supposed to be water flowing in a couple of creeks today so my plan was to hike about 8 miles and then refill at the next creek. The first creek was just barely flowing and was very shallow so I passed on it and a mile and a half later was a nice creek and I drank my fill and refilled my bottle. So nice to have water. McDuck and JFK came strolling up while I was snacking and drinking water. We hiked together for the rest of the day which consisted of lots and lots of fairly short ups over rocky crags and then back down the other side, which wasn't so bad until the rain started. Then everything got slick which makes rocky crags exciting. There were a couple of falls today thankfully no injuries were noted and thankfully I wasn't involved. 
The last several days we have seen numerous rock walls built out in the forest. Some seem to be the only one around and sometimes there are several of them in an area. I'm not sure if they are boundary lines or if they were built to keep livestock in or even built by military as a defensive line of some type.  What I think about every time I see one is how many hours of hard work it took to build one. 
When we reached the Canopus Beach Lake area we husseled up to the snack store that has a grill because it was 3:45pm and they close at 4pm. I had a cheeseburger and fries and after 18 miles they sure tasted good. While waiting on burgers to cook I also plugged in most of my electronics to charge some. After we ate we made our way to the shelter grabbed us a spot and changed into some dry clothes and started hanging wet stuff anywhere we could. Sinefeld, a guy we have been hiking around for the last couple of days showed up and is in the shelter with us. He has kept us entertained with all kinds of stories. When the rain stopped I went out and got our bear line hung so when we are all through eating we can hang our food bags. Then I worked on my journal and then ate some of my groceries before settling in for the night.

Up about 7am to the continued sound of rain on the metal roof. It did make for some good sleeping. One of the fun things about getting into a shelter wet is trying to dry stuff. When it is cool and it rains all night stuff doesn't dry. So the next morning when you get up you get to put on cool wet clothes, and this morning they were cool and wet. It was still raining when I made it on trail around 8:30am.
We hiked motivated by the thought of pizza for lunch as the trail went up and over several ridges. I started off in my rain suit and soon got to hot. Switched to my umbrella but had trouble seeing the trail and blazes on the up hill sections, and there were a bunch of them. So I put up the umbrella and let the rain fall where it may. After all I was already soaked from sweat. 
Shortly after 1pm and a half mile road walk we were eating pizza and drinking a Cherry Coke. Yum yum! Then it was back up the road and into the woods. There was just 4 or so miles left in the day and water was the topic of discussion. We knew we were going to have to carry water the question was how far. McDuck found a comment on Farout App which is the trail map we use that there were 60 gallons of water at the next road crossing 1 mile ahead. Off we went and sure enough down the stairs and across a bridge over a dry creek were 60, one gallon jugs of water. It is incredible to me that someone would fill 60 gallon jugs and then carry them all the way across the bridge for hikers that they never see and don't know. Thank you very much for your kindness. 
We loaded up on water and finished our hike for the day at the Morgan Stewart Shelter.  There was room in the shelter so we claimed a spot. Sinefeld made it and set up his tent and later Bird and Beans strolled in. They are a new couple to us and they claimed the other spots in the shelter. I ate my dinner brushed my teeth and hung my food bag so all thats left is finish my journal and go to bed. Hopefully some of my clothes will dry tonight.

I came alive around 7:15am to an almost empty shelter. Where was everyone? I  peaked out and JFK was loading up his pack and headed out and McDuck was brushing his teeth. So I got busy getting myself together and was on trail by 8Am. Once again we had the pleasure of putting on cool wet clothes this morning as nothing had dried overnight. It was not raining this morning but we were walking in the clouds. Not real foggy just a good damp fogg.
It wasn't long before our clothes were wet from the rain of yesterday to being wet from sweating today. At one point this afternoon McDuck said the heat index for our area was 102°, I think I felt that this afternoon. This morning our first treat was Nuclear Lake and it was very nice. Next came the Dover Oak and it was huge. Over 300 years old and more than six feet in diameter. Then came several board walks which are nice because it's flat and usually lots of flowers. Then we came upon the Appalachian Train Stop where you can actually get on the train if that was your plan. The nice thing about this place was down the road a bit was Malaysian food truck and yes we did, we stopped and had some. 
After lunch we spotted a wooden water tower of sorts in a pasture we were walking through. Neither McDuck or myself remember ever seeing a picture of it before in anyone else's journal. Then came the often photographed scary face tree. And it wasn't long after that we reached the Wiley Shelter. The first order of business was to get out of our wet clothes and get in something dry. Then hang out the wet stuff in in the trees and bushes and on anything else you can find.Then we claimed spots in the shelter and settled in.  I think I put pictures of most of the things we saw today in the photo list part of this journal. After 3 days of being wet I've got a couple of places that are being rubbed all wrong. Does anybody know where the Boudreaux's Butt Past is? I finally had a little appetite and ate something, but it wasn't much. Hope the appetite returns in the morning. 
Looks like it will be another early to bed kind of night. AND, I enjoyed being able to worship with the good people that make up Southwest church by video. And if your preacher isn't doing it for you Brian, our minister really does a great job. You should give him a listen some time.

Opened my eyes at 5:20am to see that I was the last one up again. I hustled myself around and was on trail by 6:15am. We had a big mile day planned and wanted an early start. So I put on all my wet  clothes and got moving. 
A couple of miles into today's hike we crossed the New York/Connecticut state line. Hooray for us! We started in Georgia then North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and now Connecticut. Wow, does that ever seem amazing. Shortly after the pictures and fist bumps we saw a Connecticut bear. That makes two bear sightings for me. Woo hoo! I got a picture this time of his little face looking at me. He's in there I'm sure.
Next we made it to the Bulls Bridge area where we walked thru a wooden covered bridge, pretty cool. Then we stopped at the Bulls Bridge Country Store and picked up some resupply items and a snack or two. From there we hiked along the Housatonic River which is a very wide rolling river. Lots of good river noise. As the day went on we had five or more tough climbs that ranged from 600 ft to 1000 feet and the several of the downs were steep especially the last down in the rain was very steep, big boulders and slick. Scary but fun. There were a few views throughout the day and my favorite was Calebs Peak. Hopefully I can include a picture. About halfway through the day we stopped at Mt Algo Shelter for a rest stop and snacks. As I walked down to the creek to get some water I slipped on a wet rock and went face down into the creek catching myself just before my face went in.. JFK was there and his comment was ""Okie, I think I would filter that first"". Near the end of the day we were back next to the Housatonic and some nice walking when it decided to pour. By the time we made it to the shelter we were wet rats. We set up in the shelter except JFK he's in his tent. There are a couple of new faces with us tonight, Booked who is a ridge runner, Chicken Wing, Samari and his fiance. Lots of good conversation while we ate dinner. It rained very hard most of the evening so tomorrows walk may be a muddy one.

Wow, did it ever rain last night, lots of thunder and lightning but I was dry in the Hollow Brooke Shelter. This morning it was about 6:30am when I got up and yes I did for one more day, put on all of my wet clothes. I was on trail by about 7:30am. 
The days hike started along the Housatonic River and was very nice hiking. The river was slightly more agitated than it was last night after all the rain. Soon the trail kicked us up into the woods with the first climb of the day. It was during that climb that I became very aware of my lack of climbing strength for the day. The legs were weak. 
Made it to the top of the 1st climb thinking this could be a bugger of a day if we have more climbs like that one. Connecticut has my attention for climbs. They like for hikers to go up to the tippy top. And we did get to enjoy or struggle up several more climbs today. I hiked by myself for part of the morning until JFK caught me as I was refilling my water bottle. He hiked on and I caught back up with him at a river crossing where it became obvious that we would need to wade across this one. The water was above several of the rocks normally used to cross it. All of us safely across we continued on struggling up the climbs and hoping the rain stayed away. 
We hiked by a pretty waterfall and a nice view today but mostly we were in the woods. One of the nicer things about today was that several of the creeks had water in them. That is a nice benefit of the rain. About 3:15pm we spilled out onto US Route 7 greatful that most of the rain had stayed away. I called the number for the Hitching Post Country Motel and after some clarification of where we were we were soon delivered to our rooms. 
All of our clothes went in the laundry basket for some poor soul to wash and dry, while we cleaned up and dried our other gear. We also got ourselves cleaned up. We ordered food and when it came the Motel owner set us up tables and chairs in the parking lot so I can now add picnicking in a Motel parking lot as a new adventure for me. Chicken Wing our new hiking friend joined us. 
After dinner there was more cleaning and drying of gear and putting away our clean clothes. I  worked on my journal and made sure electronics were being charged as well. Soon it was bed time and I was more than ready.

First time I checked the clock this morning it was just after 6am. I rolled over and went back to sleep. Next time it was 7:20am, so I started my morning. Check out time was 10am so I took my time and ate all my leftovers from last night. About 9:30 Mr. Patel was ready to take us back to the trail and away we went. 
We Started off this morning with a road walk into Canaan. It's kind of funny that we ordered food from Goshen last night and were in Canaan this morning. Our first milestone on the trail was crossing the 1500 mile mark. Again pictures and fist bumps were had. So, from where we stopped today there remains 685.7 miles to Katadyn. Woo hoo!
Next we encountered the Housatonic River falls which were impressive today. From there it wasn't long until we came upon the Giants Thumb. A rock that has the shape of a really big thumb. Rumer has it that a great Thumbooty dance was held there. From there we got to enjoy the Connecticut climbs up to a couple of view spots. Then we popped out of the woods near Salisbury Connecticut. The trail dumped us out on the road and while walking the road a very nice lady stopped her car and asked if we needed water. Yes we did came our reply. She directed us to a spigot in the cemetery for all the water we needed. So,in we went and drank our fill. Very nice trail magic. 
From there it was a race to beat the rain to the shelter. It was just to far and to many climbs so the rain won again. It started about 1:30pm and quit about 4:30pm shortly after our arrival at the shelter. North Star and Stairmaster were hold up in the shelter when we arrived but after the rain they headed on up trail. Later Veggie came up to take a break and eat and then he headed back on trail. 
I had changed out of my wet clothes into some dry clothes shortly after arriving but as the evening progressed I got chilled so I put on my puffy coat and got in my bag liners to warm up. That feels much better. Today's shelter Brassie Brooke is a new shelter built in May of this year. No graffiti on it yet. I worked on my journal and relaxed till bed time.

I looked up at 6:30am and decided if I wanted to get hiking done today I better get started. After morning chores I was on trail by 7:30am.
It was a cooler morning than we had experienced lately and that was very nice. After crossing a couple of creeks we entered a section of Mountain Laurel in bloom that was absolutely beautiful. The Mountain Laurel was as far as you could see into the forest. As the day went on we just kept hiking thru section after section of it. 
All to soon Connecticut decided to send us off in style by a 700 foot climb to the top of Bear Mountain where we enjoyed some views obscured by haze. It wasn't long after that when we hit the Connecticut/Massachusetts State Line. Woo hoo. Let's say this together,  Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut. Ten states down four more to go.
Next Massachusetts had to show us how beautiful its Mountain Laurel is and soon after that how tough their mountain climbs could be. Lots of boulder climbing and steep rock slabs. We enjoyed the views from a long ledge line as we worked our way to the top of Mt. Race. Next came the tedious 800 foot climb up to Mt Everett. Lots of boulders to navigate and steep granite slabs that they had attached wooden blocks to that helped us climb them. Then came the fun, frightening, long decent. Many times we held onto trees and used our hands to ease us down. There were a couple more views as we worked our way down, but most of the time we were focused on getting down. At one road crossing we found a cache of water and helped ourselves. Thank you Trail Angel for doing that for us. The last 3 or 4 miles was on fairly flat trail and we were able to pick our pace up. We made it to the highway into Great Barrington and started the process of getting rooms and a ride to town. JFK got rooms fairly quickly but the ride wasn't as easy. We decided to walk about a half mile up to a restaurant and eat while we waited on available rides. After our meal our ride arrived and we made it to the Travelodge, our home for tonight. 
After showers we walked over to the Price Chopper to resupply and then to McDonald's for another meal. Now we're back at the hotel waiting for our turn to do laundry.

Up around 7:30am and got myself clothed packed up and fed before our shuttle driver arrived. She was early and we were on trail by 9:30am. We started off on a nice flat section that took us beside the Housatonic River again. Walking beside a river is always nice. But never fear, Massachusetts likes to remind us that it loves good hard steep climbs. Our first one this morning was about 1000 feet and I was huffing and puffing by the time I reached the top. There was a view or two but the smoke made them all hazey. Speaking of smoke, there was talk yesterday and this morning about how bad the smoke from Canada might get today, but it didn't get that bad. What will tomorrow hold? Stay tuned. 
We had 4 or 5 of those good, hard, steep climbs and by the end of the day my legs were tired. Most of the climbs were just on the steep trail with a short boulder scrambles thrown in for the fun of it. There was one that had the rock slabs for us to climb and they take extra energy as they are always at a difficult slant.
We also had the sections with the beautiful Mountain Laurel  in it. Again it would be as far as you could see back into the forest and would make a white tunnel for us to walk through. It made me think of the verse in a song, Though your garden is rare it is not to compare, with the flower that blooms in the garden above. Thinking about Heaven and how beautiful it must be. Go ahead and sing either or both of those songs, I'll wait..........
You all sing so pretty. 
Somewhere near MA Route 23 Sister Bear was waiting for us with trail magic! She comes most weekends and sets up her table of goodies and treats hikers royally. I enjoyed a Gatorade, byng cherries, cookies, nuts, and a coke. Yum yum! That gave me the energy to do a couple more of those wonderful climbs. Sister Bear thank you very much for your kindness. 
Around 4pm we made it to the shelter and we had it all to ourselves. I got my sleep system set up and got out of my sweaty wet clothes and ate me some supper. I finished my end of day chores and went to work on this journal entry. No cell service for me tonight so I'll try and post tomorrow. 
Today we hiked 13.5 miles, 32,783 steps, low 71° high 81°. Tomorrow I am aiming for the Uper Goose Pond Shelter at mile 1556.7 or 14.2 miles.

Happy 4 month anniversary to all of us. We have been hiking and you have been following for lots and lots of days. We have hiked 1556.7 miles which leaves us 641.7 miles till Katadyn. Thank you so much for following me, for encouraging me and for praying for all of us. I'm very excited about the states and places still to come on this journey. 
I became aware of movement in the shelter at 6:10am so I got my morning started. It was another fun morning of putting on wet clothes but it wasn't from rain this morning, it was just sweat. I was on trail around 7am.
The 1st 4 or 5 miles was pretty nice hiking. There were no major ups or downs. Our first climb was up to Tyringham Cobble where there was a view. There's still smoke in the air so pictures are hazey. When we got down to Jerusalem road we were in for a treat as just a bit down the road was the Trail Stand. It's a small building with a refrigerator full of drinks and ice cream and some snacks. There is also a picnic table for us to rest at. Yes I did,  I had two sodas, bag of chips, and a ice cream Sandwich all thanks to JFK who provided the cash.
 
Right after that came about a 900 foot climb that had me breathing like a locomotive. From there the trail was fairly mild, some short ups and downs but nothing too hard. There were lots of bogs and swampy areas today that included boad walks when possible. Over the last couple of days we have encountered waist tall ferns thick on both sides of the trail. Very pretty. As we were getting started on our last 3 or 4 miles we came across Happy and Spartan. Happy thru hiked last year and Spartan is section hiking. Happy just happened to be carrying trail magic.  Yea! I enjoyed a coke and took a little orange for later.
We rolled into the camp about 2pm and were greeted by Fern and told all the things we might need to know. McDuck and I chose to get a spot in the upstairs bunkhouse, while JFK chose to tent. I set up my bunk got out of my wet clothes, hung them out to dry and relaxed for a while. While looking around I discovered that the privy here is a two seater, anyone need to go? Then I made me a friend, her trail name is Chipmunk, she is 5 years old and has an active mind. Kinda reminds me of Lucy Goosie.

I intend to get up when I heard or smelled them cooking pancakes. By the time I smelled them it was already after 6am. I wanted to be on trail by 6:30am. Oh well, maybe next time. This time I had 4 big as my plate pancakes with lots of butter and syrup and was on trail by about 7am.
I very much enjoyed putting on dry clothes this morning as we had time yesterday to hang them out to dry. However, since it started raining about 4:30 this morning dry didn't last long. It rained for most of the day, very hard from 8 to about 8:30 and then light rain or mist until early afternoon. By 8:30am I was wet to the bone and by 4pm I was dry in a few places. Except for the places that landed in the mud and water when I fell today. Thankfully no one was seriously injured in the making of this fall. 
While I'm fessing up I also went the wrong direction again today. I  veered right and should have veered left. We didn't go far because I didn't see any white blazes.
JFK headed out 1st with McDuck and I 30 to 45 minutes behind him. A couple of miles in came our 1st climb of 700 feet and it wasn't to bad it just happened to be during the down pour. It probably was our biggest climb of the day. The rest of the day was spent trying to avoid the water and mud holes on trail. There were many board walks on trail today so apparently this is a muddy wet section even when it is not raining. One of the fun things today was our visit to the cookie lady of the north. I've put a picture in my picture album and will try to include in this entry. We took probably a 30 minute break on her porch. 
Then it was more hiking in the wet forest dodging water and mud when we could and happy to see water flowing in all of the creeks. About 4pm we crossed the railroad tracks and walked into Dalton MA. The trail goes right through town and JFK had found a sub place so we met up with him there and of course had a sub. I had a 12 inch Ruben with chips and a Cherry Coke. That my friends was delicious!
Then lodging and transportation was secured and we were delivered to the Econolodge in Pittsfield MA. It's just a couple of miles up the road from Dalton. 
Wet clothes were soon off and showers taken as the evening was quickly getting away from us. We walked across the street to McDonald's for supper and found North Star and Stairmaster there. It was fun visiting with them. After that it was hiker midnight. 
Today we hiked 20.8 miles, 51,101 steps, low 61° high 66°. Tomorrow I am aiming for Mark Noepel Shelter mile 1591 or 13.5 miles.

Up by 7:30am got dressed in my mostly dry clothes and headed over to McDonald's for a breakfast sandwich. Walking back to the hotel it started misting. It took a little while for us to wrangle a shuttle so we weren't on trail till 10:45am.
The first part of the walk was town walking and we walked by some very nice old neighborhoods with well kept flower and vegetable gardens. The people seemed very friendly. Who knows what Dalton is famous for? They make the paper that is used to print our paper money. Now you know. 
Just as we reached the outskirts of town up went the trail. About 1000 feet up later we had reached the top. As we were descending we came to a nice view spot of Cheshire MA and Cheshire Reservoir. It wasn't long after that when we arrived in Cheshire. As we walked through a neighborhood a young man had a lemonade stand set up so we each had a glass of lemonade and a cookie. He was kind enough to fill our water bottles up for us also. We had a nice visit and then moved on.
Then the big climb for the day started. We went up 1700 feet to our shelter and there were a couple of places that were extra steep. Needless to say I was breathing like a locomotive most of the afternoon. Once we reached the shelter we were happy to claim spots inside. It's supposed to storm here tonight so inside the shelter is good. The trail remains very muddy and wet but while hiking today it did not rain on us. Yea!
Today we hiked 13.5 miles, 31,876 steps, low 71° high 78°. Tomorrow I am aiming for Williamstown MA at mile 1600.6 or 9.6 miles. We are hoping to enjoy some 4th of July activities especially food.

I was snoozing this morning when the alarm on Kathy's phone went off at 6am, she apparently was at the privy. Kathy is a section hiker that joined us at the shelter last night. She is a very nice lady and a softball coach. She never new that the alarm went off. Anyway now that I'm awake might as well get up and get going. 
We were on trail by 7:15am and as we were about halfway up Mt. Greylock I wasn't surprised that the trail went up. What did surprise me very quickly was that we were going down. Yes they took us back down part of the mountain before we finished the climb and by the time we had made it to the soggy, foggy top of Mt. Greylock we had climed about 1200 feet. As we reached the top we saw Burrito and Sour Patch getting out of their shuttle. They had hiked to the lodge at Mt. Greylock last night and then shuttled into Williamstown for the night. They had beautiful pictures of the sunset from the top of Greylock that they took last night. We all went in the lodge and JFK bought breakfast for us all. Nice breakfast and a good visit with Burrito and Sour Patch. 
The war memorial at the top of Greylock was fogged in but it was interesting going in and climbing to the top anyway. Then came the long muddy wet downhill section into Williamstown. While going down it decided to rain pretty hard again so for me out came the umbrella. As we neared the town and the trail flattened out a little we got into some very slick clay soil. I won't mention any names but all of the sudden I'm hearing from behind me ""Fraziers down Fraziers down"" which is his way of saying I fell.
 
Then came our big moment of the day. Mile 1600. Yes there were pictures taken and fist bumps all around. Right after that the trail dumped us out onto the streets of Williamstown where we soon spotted three ice chest left by the First Baptist church of North Adams. It was TRAIL MAGIC! One had snacks in it, one had supplies like Toothpaste, lotion, first aid, etc. and one had ice cold drinks. Thank you so much for your kindness to hikers. From there we walked a couple more blocks to the highway intersection where our hotel for the night would come and get us and takeus to the Motel. It started to rain again, so we moved down just a bit to what appeared to be a church building. They didn't have a awning of any type so we got under a tree. Soon the rain let up and I moved over and set on the steps and noticed the sign on the door that said This is a Private Residence. JFK joined me and after a few minutes we heard the door open and a very unhappy woman told us we were setting on her steps and we needed to move. And we did, right out to the sidewalk in front and waited on our shuttle there. Soon it came and a very nice gentleman delivered us to the Motel and checked us in.
First order of business was to get out of wet clothes and get all our stuff taken to the office to be laundered. Then we got cleaned up and took a very nice nap. It took awhile but around 6pm we got our laundry back and after getting clean clothes on we called for a shuttle to take us to the grocery store. Since it was raining again, we decided to get food at the grocery store to eat for tonight's dinner. I  had a large chef salad, two six in subs, two avocados, and an apple fritter. Then I got my resupply organized and packed in the food bag. By that time it was past hiker midnight and since the fireworks were rained out we thought, I worked on my journal. When all of the sudden the boom booms came and we went out and you could kinda see the fireworks show. I hope all of you had a happy Fourth of July.

I was up and ready to go see what was on the Motel Breakfast buffet by 7:30am. There was a nice variety of fruit and breads, so I had some of most of it. 
Back in the room we got our bags ready and waited for the 9:30 shuttle back to the trail. Back on trail about 9:30am and we finished our town walk by walking up someone's driveway and on into the woods. From that point we were hiking next to a beautiful stream and going up. At some point probably about 30 minutes later we moved away from the stream but kept going up. When we finished the climb of about 1600 feet we were standing at the Massachusetts/Vermont state line. Woo hoo! Pictures and fist bumps all around were had. So, let's try this again; Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Thanks to Slowsy Mosey I didn't leave out Pennsylvania this time. Three states left to complete. 
At the Vermont state line the AT joines the Long Trail. The two trails run together for the next 100 miles. We continued our hike in Vermont and I  soon came to some 1st impressions of the trail. Vermont is nicknamed Vermud because it is normally a muddy trail and after several days of rain it is Vermud. The trail is overgrown, trees and brush have encroached onto the trail in lots of places making it difficult to see what you're stepping in. And in places the trail is not well marked. 
About 10 miles in we came to a powerline view. That's where they have cleared a section for powerlines and it provides us a view. There was a nice breeze so we stopped for a snack break. After the break it was more of try not to step in the deep mud or the water over your shoes. As we neared the shelter we came alongside another lovely creek which always makes hiking better.  Then we rolled into our shelter and claimed spots inside. There are lots of folks here and its been a busy evening. The hikers joining us that i know are Gonzo, Point Man, Major, and Smiles.

Up at six as I heard some stirring and since we had a big mile day planned I would get around and get going. I was on trail by 7am and greeted by a lovely mud hole right out of the gate. There were quite a few of them again today but I don't think there were as many as yesterday. 
Today was a day of big climbs and steep descents.  I'm not sure how many times we went up or came down but by the end of the day my legs were tired of doing either of them. Earlier in the hike we had what seems to be a rare occurrence in Vermont, a view. Later on we got to walk between the split rock, not all that exciting but another one of those AT things to do. As the days get warmer and more humid we are going through more water and today at our water stop there were lots of pretty butterflies. A couple of them landed on my pack. Hopefully I can get a picture included. 
 
As we were getting close to the shelter JFK said rain was close by and he thought he had felt a drop or two. As tired as I was I found another gear to get me up the trail to the shelter. We made it claimed our spots and within 30 minutes the rain began. We were nice and dry inside the shelter. I ate all the food I brought for today, brushed my teeth and put my food bag in the bear box. Now I'm ready for bed time and it's only 6pm.
Joining us at the shelter are Hot Lips and Cave Man a couple of thru hikers and when they complete the AT they will be triple crown hikers. They will have hiked the CDT, the PCT and the AT. They are part of an elite hiking group.

I was up around 5am this morning as I heard some stirring and decided to get my day started. It gets fairly light even before 5am so why not get going. I put on my slightly damp clothes again this morning and JFK and I were on trail by 6:30 and were walking at a nice leisurely pace. 
There were a couple of big climbs for today and I was hoping to get a few miles in before the humidity jumped on us. Oh well it was worth the try. We made our first climb in good shape but again at the top there were no views. As we hiked on we made our plan for getting water just before we started our big climb up Stratton Mountain. There is a lovely Lookout Tower that we were hoping would provide us some of those rare Vermont views. About an hour and forty five minutes and 1700 feet later we were soaked with sweat huffing and puffing but at the base of the tower. There were spectacular views all around from the top along with sunshine and a breeze to help dry us off some. I wanted to stay longer but since the tower is a tourist attraction in this area and several more  people came up I had to share. 
From there we worked our way down the other side of the mountain to the Stratton Pond Shelter. I was hoping it would be very near the pond but it tis not. You can't even see the pond from the shelter. We made it to an empty shelter around 1:30pm and claimed spots. Next order of business before the afternoon thunderstorms arrive is to gather water. With that successfully done it was time for me to nap and it was delightful. Shortly after I woke up the rain hit and it rained hard, while we stayed dry in the shelter. It was another early supper night as we are all hungry after our days journey. Tonight we have Point Man, Sinefeld and Remington that have joined us.

Up about 5:30am to a very busy shelter. After I had posted yesterday's journal the rains came in sheets and the wet hikers came running into the shelter. There ended up being 14 or more of us there and it was wall to wall this morning. I got myself ready and we were on trail by around 6:30am.
With all of the rain yesterday the trail was a mushy muddy mess. Our plan was to hike the 10 or so miles to the trail head near Manchester go into town eat and resupply and get back to the trail. We slogged our way the 10 miles to the trail head, then made a mad dash across the highway to a wonderful surprise of trail magic. Josh and his crew had it all. Cold drinks, sweet snacks, salty snacks and fruit. It was great! And to make it even better he took us to town. Thank you very much for all you did for us. 
We get dropped off at McDonald's for burgers, then made our way about a block to a bakery for bagels. Then over to the Food Chopper for resupply. While we sat out front sorting through our purchases and discussing our next few days a gentleman asked if we needed a ride back to the trail. It is amazing how the trail provides. Bill, a retired forest service man, gave us a ride back to the trail head. What a perfectly timed peace of trail magic. So thankful for your kindness Bill. 
Back on trail we had 2 or so more miles and 700 feet of climb before we made it to the shelter. Once there we claimed our spots, got water and visited with Turtle Toes and Yard Sale. They are a fun couple to be around and they offered us food. That's a good combination. I had my delicious supper of 3 tuna fish packets and 3 Ritz cheese packets. Then tried to hold off hitting the sack.

About 5:30am I looked up and I was the only one still snoozing. So I got busy and put on my damp clothes hoping for our fourth day in a row not to get rained on while hiking and was on trail by 6:30am.
We had about a mile climb to the top of Bromley Mountain and in no time we were there. It is a ski mountain and there is a lift station and a warming Hut on top. Normally there is also a view but not today. As we hiked on we had another tough climb to the top of Styles Peak, no view today. During one of our climbs there was a sign to a bad weather trail and since it was such a beautiful day we took the good weather trail. It went up steep slabs of rock slanted steeply to our left. Challenging but fun.
Towards the end of the hike we hiked next to a little creek and again I enjoyed the sounds. Then the pond came into view and we rolled into the shelter. We were tired and foot weary but not wet from the rain. It thunder around us several times but thankfully the rain stayed away. We claimed our spots and collected water so when the rain comes we can stay dry in the shelter. 
Tonight at the shelter is Veggie, Tail Wind, Branch, and several others I haven't got name's for. About 4pm the rain started and it absolutely poured. Tomorrow could get interesting.

I heard people getting around just before 6am this morning but as it was still raining I rolled over and snoozed some more. As I  mentioned yesterday it started raining about 4pm and rained most of the night, and was still raining when I got up about 7am. And again I got to put on my damp clothes. It was still raining when we hit the trail around 8am and we had re-evaluated our days plan. Instead of the 19 mile day we would attempt a 5 mile day to get to VT Route 140 road crossing and get a shuttle to Rutland VT.
Our first sign that it had rained a lot last night was where we got our water from the pond the previous night was now about a half foot under water. Hmm. Then the trails were flooded with water running down them or if it was flat the trail was now a shallow pond. As we sloshed along we came to a place the reminded me of the story of Moses striking the rock to get water. Right out from under a rock on the side of the mountain was now a river flowing directly across the trail. Hmm.
We continued our slogging up the trail river through the trail ponds and down the trail rivers occasionally having to cross what used to be little creeks that were now swollen but still very passable. Rarely did our feet hit a place that didn't include water. We crossed a bigger creek on a small bridge and with another half foot of water that bridge would be under water. We found the rock gardens which are a couple of places hikers have stacked rocks in all sorts of ways. Somewhere along the rock gardens is where fall number 7 took place.  I was stepping over a small log so as not to slip and fall on it and when my left foot hit the ground it did not stop sliding till all of me was on the ground. Thankfully again, no one was injured in the making of this fall. As we got closer to our road destination you could begin to hear a roaring noise and as we got closer you could see the source of the roar. What used to be a mild fairly wide creek had turned into an angry rushing river. Hmmm. We normally would have been able to rock hop across it, but now it was turn around don't drown time. I hope I can include a video of this angry creek at the end of this entry. 
 
We did turn around but the question was turn where? McDuck had noticed a sign and trail to a picnic area about half a mile away. That McDuck doesn't miss a thing. So we made our way to the White Rocks Picnic Area without having to deal with the angry creek. After several calls and internet work we had a shuttle on its way and rooms reserved at the Days Inn Rutland Vermont. While we were waiting Branch, a hiking friend slogged over and said she had already arranged for a shuttle into town. 
Our shuttle driver Tom arrived and we were promptly delivered to our hotel.  On the way in he said this is the worst he's seen it since the last hurricane came through. We checked in got to our rooms and got ourselves cleaned and dry. The sad news was that the clothes dryer was broken. Look out Rutland laundry businesses, we have nasty clothes coming your way. JFK rented a car for us and soon we were off in search of food. McDuck and I tried the lobster roll tonight and I thought it was delicious. It just wasn't enough to fill me up. After eating we went for a resupply/food for our room kind of thing and I got me a pint of ice cream. You know I've heard somewhere that ice cream is the most important meal of the day. 
Back to the room we snacked worked on journals, I worked on my feet and relaxed. Then JFK said he found a laundry open till 10 pm, anybody for laundry? So, we went and did our laundry.  Tomorrow we will be busy cleaning up and drying out gear, picking up a replacement part for McDuck and eating more town food. 
Today we hiked 5.5 miles, 18,501 steps, low 63° high 63°. Tomorrow we are planning a zero day. There has been lots of talk about trail closures and such so we will let it dry some and see what we can learn.

I had this great plan for sleeping in this morning at least to maybe 7:30am. Wrong, the smoke alarms went off about 6:30 bringing everyone out of their rooms wondering whats going on. When it didn't appear that we were in any immediate danger we got dressed and went down for breakfast. Yes I ate my breakfast along with many others as the smoke alarms blared. When the fire trucks arrived the firemen made quick work of inspecting the building and turning off the alarms. Hooray for the 1st responders!
When I finished breakfast I hustled to the room and got my clean hiking clothes to take outside to treat with Permethrin again. With that chore completed I started on organizing food and finding more stuff to clean and dry. 
Around 9am we hopped in the rental car and headed for Norwich Vermont. McDuck had a replacement piece to his trecking pole mailed to their post office. The ride over was very entertaining as we worked our way around debris from all of the flooding in this part of the world. We dodged rock slides, downed trees, mud, low hanging power lines, pavement washed away, water running across the road and perhaps a orange cone or two all before arriving in Norwich. Some of the places that we traveled through were Quechee, Woodstock, Balloch and Hartland. While in Norwich we walked up to Dan and Whits store which is a one stop for anything you might need type of store. It's just one of the places to see when in Norwich. We also made a trip into Hanover New Hampshire for a bite to eat at Lou's restaurant. In about 4 days, trail and weather permitting, we will hike into Norwich and Hanover. Maybe we'll have time to eat at Lou's again. 
After our lunch we hopped back into the car for a less scenic ride to Rutland. We have a four day plan to get us to Hanover, a shuttle driver scheduled for in the morning, so that means one more trip to the store for another days resupply for me. I got to kick my feet up for awhile and relax before it was time to go eat and finish the resupply. We selected the Yellow Deli which is rumored to be a cult of some kind. The food was good and the people tried hard to be friendly. Then we stopped at three grocery stores until we all had just the right kinds and amounts of food. Back to the room it was tidy up things finish the journal entry and sleep time.

I had set my alarm for 6:20am so that I would be ready to go by 7:30. I went down for my nutritious breakfast and almost had the place to myself. Next it was one last check of everything to make sure I was ready. By 7:30 we were all in the car to take it back to the rental company. Our shuttle driver arrived right on time at 8am and had us on trail by about 8:30am. 
We were curious as to how the trail and creeks would be today and as we started with a 45 minute climb we found the trails in fair shape. Coming down the other side of that Bear mountain we had one of those rare Vermont views. It was of the Clarendon Airport. A nicer view. Shortly after that was the Clarendon Gorge and the river below was still rolling. Then shortly after that was trail magic! A lovely lady named Sarah had cold drinks and a few snacks. She was telling us about how different the gorge we had just crossed over looked after this flood. Than you Sarah for your kindness to thru hikers. We have read and heard news reports that in many ways this flood is worse than when hurricane Irene came through this part of the world. 
It wasn't long after the trail magic that we were going up again. A very steep and rocky climb made me go into full locomotive mode. I was very happy we we reached the top and our second view for the day. Woo hoo! Then we came down some before another big climb to Beacon Hill where there is a FAA Signal Tower, but no view. 
Then we hiked a ways to Cold River road where we new we had choices to make. 1st choice, do we road walk some to a roadside trail stand for snacks? Answer was yes. It wasn't really a great place but I did refill my water bottle. 2nd choice, do we follow the advice of the local trail maintainers and road walk around the river that on good days requires fording? Answer yes, we had been told it was waist deep. 3rd choice, do we road walk around a section of trail that a mud slide had taken out the ground under the trail. We had been told that it cut under the trail about 4 feet but the trail was still there. Answer yes, we didn't want to be the ones to test how strong that portion was. I think we made some excellent choices. Yard Sale and Turtle Toes joined us or we joined them in the walk arounds.
After that it was a short .7 mile hike through the woods to the shelter. We still got to ford the last creek before the shelter. Not too wide and less than knee deep. We claimed our spots in the shelter and got busy with our chores. I  kept my damp clothes on trying to dry them but eventually got cool so I changed into camp clothes. Then it was time to eat. We had another enjoyable evening visiting with Yard Sale and Turtle Toes. 
Today we hiked 14.2 miles, 35,072 steps, low 67° high 76°. Tomorrow I am aiming for Stoney  Brook Shelter at mile 1719.2 or 20.6 miles. While we were eating Major and Smiles walked by. They got water and pushed on.

I was up at 5:40am getting ready for a big day of hiking. Once again I put on my damp clothes and we were on trail by 6:40am. Our first milestone was crossing the 1700 mile marker, and that came 1.3 miles into our hike. Pictures and fist bumps were had. That means we have less than 500 miles to go. As a matter of fact we have 479.2 miles to Katadyn. I clearly remember how excited I was to reach the 500 mile mark and I  can tell you that I am very excited to have less than 500 miles to go.
So after that milestone what should we do for the rest of the day? Climb, and climb we did. By the end of the day we had climed over 5300 feet. We also descended about 5300 feet. My feet and legs are weary tonight. At the top of Killington our first big climb we had a nice view and saw the chair lifts for the ski resort. McDuck and I took time to upload our journals. Last couple of nights we have not had cell service so we upload when we can.
Then we spent the next few hours working our way down Killington to US Route 4. It was one of the roads that had been closed due to the flooding. It was obviously open now as we hurried across the road. We had another nice climb before descending down to Thundering Falls. It is a very nice falls and hopefully I can get a video of it in this entry. 
From there we again went up and it was steep and relentless. When I reached the top of that climb I was wore flat out and there was still over 3 miles and another climb to go. Needless to say when we waddled into the shelter area we were beat. There were spots available in the shelter so we claimed them. There are 3 others in the shelter with us but I only remember one name, Chickadee. 
We completed our chores and ate all before the heavy thunderstorms hit. When they hit we found out that we were not as dry as we thought. There were a couple of leaks in the shelter. So we played dodge the drip for awhile. By 7:30 pm I was on my way to sleep. 
Today we hiked 20.6 miles, 55,140 steps, low 62° high 78°. Tomorrow I am aiming for Cloudland Shelter at mile 1740.1 or 20.9 miles.

Up about 6am to get the day started. After a night of rain the ground around the shelter was very soggy. We were on trail by 7:15am with the promise of another day full of climbs.
We started the morning with a nice climb and found the trail had survived the rain better than we thought it might. Next came the aluminum ladder descent. Yes they have secured a ladder to a huge rock and to get down you climb down the ladder. If I can add a video tonight you can see it.
Lots more ups and downs till we came to a sign that said bridge washed out and suggested a walk around. We chose the walk around and I'm very glad we did. Oh, after seeing the bridge I think we could have crossed it just fine it was the ice cream place we would have never seen if we hadn't done the walk around. And I got my very 1st Maple CreeMee, oh so good. After that we walked about 1/4 of a mile down the highway and found another food store so we stopped in for additional treats. 
Back on trail we had more climbs to do and by this time of the day my climber was tired. We reached another creek crossing but this one had no bridge just a cable across the creek to assist you as you ford the creek. We passed that up and found a tree across the creek and got over on it.
 
We filled up on water and proceeded to climb some more. Our total climb for the day was over 6000 feet. No wonder my legs and feet are tired.
About 6:30pm we staggered into the shelter completely surprised to find it empty. We claimed our spots and got busy with chores. I  ate, visited with Gorgeous and hopped into my bag to get away from mosquitoes.

Up about 6am put on my damp clothes and got busy with morning chores. I was very thankful that it did not rain yesterday. Thats 4 days in a row not getting rained on while hiking. It did rain some during the night but we stayed dry. I was on trail by 7:15 am looking forward to fewer miles today. 
We had a couple of challenging climbs today along with one pretty good rock hopping river crossing but all in all not a bad hike. We caught up with Luna and her owner Jukebox and flip flopped with them a time or two and then passed Black Beard as he was gathering water. 
Just as we were about to enter Norwich Vermont there was TRAIL MAGIC. Skittles and his friends had cold drinks, fruit, cinnamon rolls, watermelon and of course Skittles. All was delicious and a hugh thank you for treating us so kindly. We finished the walk from Norwich to Hanover and on the bridge over the Connecticut River is where we crossed the state line into New Hampshire. Woo Hoo! Twelve states completed two more to go. 
Once in Hanover we made our way to Lou's restaurant again and this time I tried their version of a Reuben sandwich and it was delightful. While there JFK got us rooms at the Super 8 in White River Junction just up the road from Hanover. Next it was figure out how to get there. Uber no, shuttle no, so what to do next? Our waitress overheard our dilemma and offered to take us when she got off work after 3:30pm. So Leah became our next Trail Angel by giving us a ride to our hotel. Thank you very much Leah for your kindness to three stinky hikers. 
We checked in and got cleaned up which felt oh so nice then it was time for food. We ended up at Dunkin Donuts where I got a breakfast sandwich. Not any other food choices in our area. Back to the room I finished my journal entry and dried some of my gear.

Up this morning by 6:30 so I would be ready for our 7:30am shuttle. We are being shuttled out of Hanover and will be walking back into Hanover. Our Shuttle driver is Clair a high-school teacher in Hanover and was super friendly. She wouldn't accept payment for the shuttle ride. Just another example of how wonderfully kind some people are.
It was raining when she dropped us at the trailhead and it rained most of our hike. There were a few periods of heavy downpours and soon the trail was a creek again. We had a couple of decent climbs today but nothing that was very awful. There were no views because of the rain but we did pass by several view spots. And for those of you with sharp eyes yes I fell again today. Thankfully know one was injured in the making of this fall. We met several hikers that we knew today Black Beard, Major, Smiles, and Aileron we saw on trail and Gonzo and Chickadee once we made it to Hanover. As you may know Hanover is home to Dartmouth University so we got to see lots of the buildings and sports complexes associated with it.
We had trail magic 3 times on this rainy day. 1st time was right after a road crossing there was a round container that had cinnamon crumb cake in it, big thick slices and they were still warm. That was fantastic! 2nd was at the next road crossing there was an ice chest with orange soda pop. Thank you very much it was delicious. The 3rd was in Hanover a lady had a tent set up with cold drinks, fruit, chips and sandwiches. It is amazing how many people just want to do something nice for hikers. 
Angela and David arrived about 4pm and after we finished our hike through town we all made our way to a LL Bean, then to a delicious Italian restaurant called Three Tomatoes. From there we found the Dairy Twirl and I had a pint of Dark Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, ummm ummm good. You know I've heard somewhere that ice cream is the most important meal of the day. Next stop was the condo in Woodstock Vermont our home for the next few days. We quickly got some clothes washing, showers taken, stuff out of bags drying, you know the stuff we do when we get the opportunity.

Up about 6:45am got ready and we were out the door not to long later. We headed down to a quick stop for snacks for the next couple of days and then Angela our shuttle driver for the next few days dropped us off at Kinsman Notch our starting place for today. No sooner had we got out of the car than I hear Okie, McDuck, JFK? It was Snickers, Aileron's wife. She had just dropped him off. And you might have guessed she had a Snickers bar for everyone. Thank you Snickers!
We are hiking south bound today and first up is Mt Moosilauke. You can say that like Moose a lock, or Moose a lockee. I like the 2nd way better because its more funner to say. It was a beast of a climb and part of it was next to waterfalls and was so pretty. The climb was over boulders and big rocks which was fun at times but so steep it was exhausting. The closer we got to the top the more the fir trees lined the path and it was delightful. Then the views started popping in and out as the clouds would come and go. It was a spectacular way to start the day. Lots of hikers on top and we chilled out, had some snacks like a snickers bar, and rested a bit before heading down. 
 
The Trail Lined With Christmas Trees Down was not as steep or difficult but was a long way. We then continued on another several miles of hiking in the New Hampshire woods. We saw several more hikers we knew today, Aileron, North Star, Stairmaster, Point Man, Spartacus, and many others. The day was a little warm but no rain and lots of sunshine. We ended the day with more trail magic from Angela a coke and some snacks. Thank you Angela!
On our way home we stopped off for the most important meal of the day, ice cream! I had the special of the day Moose mint shake with whooped cream and drizzled chocolate. Ummm ummm good. After a quick stop at the store we were home. We each got showers while Angela slaved over a hot stove cooking us chicken and dumplings, corn on the cobb, peas, broccoli among other delicious items. It was all so delicious. I then worked on my trecking pole tip replacing it. I was successful in replacing the tip. I worked on my journal and then to bed I went.

Up by 6:30 this morning cause our shuttle driver was ready to go by 7:30. We had a lot of miles to cover today and needed to get started. 
Angela dropped us off and into the woods we went. The first part of the morning was pretty mild. We still are dealing with the mud in places but I suspect that will continue until we summit Katadyn. Our 1st mountain today was Mt Cube, it was a pretty tough climb but at times we would be in the fir trees along the trail and the sun would break through the forest canopy and it was very pleasant. The top of Mt Cube is all rock and there were a whole bunch of high-school age kids from a summer camp enjoying the mountain top. We took a few pictures rested and snacked and then headed down before that big group started down. We stopped for water on the way down and that's when the rain started. Just all of the sudden it was coming down heavy. Rain jackets on, we hiked on.
Sometime before our 2nd mountain of the day it quit raining and off came the rain jackets cause they be hot. Our 2nd mountain, Mt Smart was an easier climb. It was a 4 mile climb but not real steep and that made it easier.  On top was a fire tower that we climbed and enjoyed the views from it. With the Canada smoke and the clouds views weren't that great but I still like to see the sights. 
From there it was a pretty tough down hill section for the first couple of miles. We moved slowly so there wouldn't be any more falls today. You see by this time all of us had gone down. There were no serious injuries but I think there will be a bruise or two and maybe a mark for a few days. As we got close to our pickup spot most of us were in need of water and happy to find a nice creek to fill up bodies and bottles. Then the race was on. You could hear thunder in the distance and we had two miles to our pickup. As we walked through the last field before the road it started to sprinkle and just after we got loaded into the car the rain started. We felt very blest that the rain held off this afternoon. Thanks to all of you praying for less rain on us.
We then found a pizza place and filled our bellies, very good pizza. Then it was a long ride back to our home where we couldn't wait to get out of our wet clothes and get cleaned up. We saw several hikers we knew again today but as I'm tired and sleepy the only ones I can remember are Luna and her human Jukebox, Turtle Toes and Yard Sale. But the big news of the day was surpassing the 1800 mile mark. Wow! It it so hard to believe and amazing that we have hiked that far.
Today we hiked 20.9 miles, 53,272 steps, low 68° high 73°. Tomorrow I have know real idea about what we are going to do so you'll just have to stay tuned. 389.6 miles to Katahdin.

Up very near 8am, did that ever feel nice. Fixed myself a little breakfast and mostly relaxed. JFK and McDuck worked hard on figuring out our plan for the next few days. About noonish we headed out to Polly's Pancake Parlor a place Angela had been told about. I had 3 kinds of pancakes all made with different batter and fruit or nuts, and real maple syrup. Very tasty 
From there we took a scenic drive to Conway New Hampshire to the REI store trying to get McDuck's hiking pole fixed. It didn't fix so he replaced them. On the way through town we spotted a DQ and yes we did, a large Choco Strawberry Blizzard for me thank you very much. Next it was back on the road this time taking the Kancamagus highway. Another scenic drive that brought us home. Along the way we saw glimpses of several of the mountains that we will be climbing in the next week. They sure look tall.
Once home I got busy organizing my gear and repacking my pack. My food bag sure feels heavy. I'm thinking those climbs tomorrow may be very slow. Burgers arrived and they were delicious along with an abundance of fries. After that I relaxed and worked on my journal.

Up at 6:30 dressed, fixed myself 3 eggs and was on trail by 7:30. We said our goodbyes to Angela and David and Started climbing. MT Wolf was up 1st and was a challenging 1600 foot climb. There weren't many views but we got occasional glimpses of the surrounding mountains. 
Our 2nd climb was Mt Kinsman. It proved to be a real challenge. Very steep climbs lots of boulders and shear rock face, with several places that you had to use your hands to complete the climb. But as we reached the top the views started coming in and they were spectacular! Rows upon rows of mountains everywhere you looked, it seemed as though you could see forever. Beautiful! It was a gorgeous day to be hiking and the views were amazing. All too soon we started down and it was every bit as difficult if not more as going up. Hand climbing down and holding on to trees to get down. Very slow moving for us all day. On one of the rare flat sections I was transitioning from a board walk to a rock when the next thing I knew I was trying my best to keep my face off the rock. I almost succeeded. My nose made contact with the rock but not very bad. So, again, no one was seriously injured in the making of this fall. 
 
View from Kinsman Mountain 
Finally, and I say finally because I was tired and my feet hurt, we made it to Lonesome Lake Hut. We checked in got our instructions and made our way to bunkhouse #1, our 10X10 room with 4 bunk beds. Soon our wet clothes were off dry clothes on and we were in our bunks with our feet up. About 5:30pm we joined a introduction to the Hut's talk and learned how they get stuff to the huts and why the huts exist. We also learned a little about the staff. Next was dinner: big bowl of lentils, maple bread, salad, green peas, lasagna, and brown butter chocolate chip cookies. All you could eat kinda meal and it was delicious. After dinner we learned more about the 5 staff members and the I made my way to our deluxe room to get my journal entry done.
A very special thank you to Angela for all she did for us the last few days. You are a great host and I appreciate what you did. Fretta, sorry it didn't work out like you planned but glad you gave it a try.

Up just before the 6:30am chorus of We Are Young, sung by the crew at Lonesome Lake Hut. I got ready repacked my backpack and was up having a nice hot cup of Earl Grey before 7am. Soon breakfast was served and we had oatmeal, scrambled eggs, sausage, and pumpkin chocolate chip bread all very tasty along with a skit to remind us to pack out what we pack in, stay on the trail and to fold our blankets up from last night. By about 7:40am we were on trail. 
It was a downhill trail that followed a creek closely when the creek wasn't the trail. Lots of rock hopping but not a bad trail. About 30 minutes or so from Interstate 93 where we would begin our big climb for the day it started raining. Hmmm, the forecast didn't call for rain until around 2pm. As we continued hiking the rain came down harder. By the time we reached the Interstate it was a steady downpour. Once under the interstate and out of the rain we checked the radar and our unanimous decision was to get out of the rain. We did not like the thought of climbing Mt Lafayette's rocks and boulders in the rain. 
So, JFK worked his magic and booked us rooms and we worked on a shuttle without any luck. We decided to walk about a mile to The Flume Gorge Visitors Center to see if they had shuttle information. They did and about 20 minutes later we were on our way to Inn32 in Woodstock Vermont. It was way to early to check in so we perched ourselves on a bench out front and waited. About an hour later and we're in our rooms. Some very nice people run this place. 
Soon JFK heads out to get a new pair of socks and McDuck and I head across the  street to the quick stop for lunch and snacks. After lunch it was showers and a nap. Now thats how to spend a rainy afternoon. Around 5pm David and Sarah came around and offered their shuttle services to us for dinner and back to the trail in the morning. About 6pm they picked us up and took us to Gordi's for a nice dinner, and arranged to pick us up in the morning at 7:15am to take us to the trail. It is hard to find shuttle service that good anywhere. 
Back to the room I ate a pint of ice cream cause I've heard somewhere that ice cream is the most important meal of the day, finished my journal entry and went to bed.

Lafayette Mountain 
We had a big long climb to start with up to Mt. Liberty, next was Little Haystack, Lincoln, then the big one Mt. Lafayette. Those mountains are connected by the Franconia Ridge. We had clearing skies as we approached Little Haystack and Lincoln and had spectacular views. Lots and lots of day and weekend hikers out which makes for some fun conversations. As we headed on towards Lafayette the clouds rolled back in and the views were mostly gone. 
The trail today was another tough one with loads of big rocks to climb and miles of steep incline and then decline. I was a tired puppy when we finally rolled into the Garfield Shelter. I had stopped just before the shelter and filled up with water so I was ready to claim my spot. Bean the caretaker was checking in JFK so I claimed my spot and got in line to pay my $10 for the privilege to sleep in this shelter. Bean carefully went over the rules and then gave me the look like I'm going to have trouble with you aren't I. I got my spot set up and grabbed a snack then I changed into warmer dryer clothes. Later Bean came by and said to me, I thought you were going to go set on the bench? I told her I did but the bench was occupied however they had a nice fire going. She said fire! There are no fires allowed in the Whites! So I  said, just kidding, I got her good.

The shelter was bustling by 6am this morning but I just stayed in my bag till after 7am. It got fairly cool last night and my bag felt cozy warm. We were in no hurries this morning and that was a good thing. Beans, our caretaker told us this morning that she had 55 guest last night. She was a busy lady.
Once we got on trail we had our hands or should I say our feet full. A very steep downhill section that doubled as a water fall. It was not only difficult in places it was a bit frightful. We eventually made it down safely and proceeded on. After a couple of miles we reached Gailhead Hut with a beautiful view. We used our AMC cards to get us some pumpkin chocolate chip bread and refilled our water bottles. Then we headed out again. 
Next was a challenging climb up to the top of South Twin mountain and the views were spectacular, awesome, amazing. We could see 360° to mountains we had been on in the last day or two and the mountains we would be climbing soon. MT Washington stood above them all and we should climb it on Tuesday if all works out. After several minutes on South Twin we headed off. Much of the day we enjoyed walking through the narrow Christmas tree lined trail enjoying the pine smell. 
 
View From South Twin Mountain 
We climbed a couple other mountains catching the views that were available on this absolutely gorgeous day. Zealand mountain was next on our climbing list and soon we had accomplished that climb. Then it was a 3 or so mile downhill section that once again was full of steep sections with our favorite rocks and boulders. Around 3:30pm we rolled into Zealand Falls Hut got assigned our bunks and were soon out on the rocks of the falls drying clothes, soaking our feet and enjoying the sunshine. At 6pm sharp came the dinner call and a whole heard of us came for supper. After supper I brushed my teeth and crawled into my bunk.

Up about 6:15am shortly before the official wake up song at 6:30am. Got myself ready and was waiting when they called us for breakfast. It was a full Hut with over 30 people staying the night.  As soon as breakfast was over we loaded up and headed out.
The 1st 7 miles today was great hiking, mostly flat and few sections with rocks. We made great time and remembered the days when that was normal hiking for us. At the end of that was highway 302 and that is where our day would change. 
We stopped and ate snacks refilled our water and started the 2900 foot climb up Mt Webster. There was lots of challenging sections to this climb and there were many excellent views. The Webster Ledges as they are called provided great views of where we had hiked from today and as we got closer to the top we began to see Mt Washington where we hope to hike to tomorrow. It was another absolutely beautiful day and on several occasions we hiked through the Christmas tree lined trail enjoying the pine smell. 
Then our hike took us up and over Mt Jackson and again the views were spectacular. From there we could see the Mizpah Hut off in the distance. After enjoying the views we set out sights on Mizpah and away we went. About 3:30 we arrived, checked in and got our bunks for the night. We're beginning to see a pattern to us being assigned the bunks at the far end of each Hut. Wonder why that might be? The crew called for supper right at 6pm and boy was I ever ready to eat. Pumpkin soup, bread, kale salad, mixed partially cooked vegetables including asparagus, Dijon chicken, quinoa, and chocolate cookies. You can bet I had some of all of it. After supper then I hit my bunk getting off of my feet. Looking forward to a big day tomorrow.

Up a few minutes before our lovely wake up music and breakfast call. Got dressed and made sure my pack was ready then went in a fixed myself a cup of Earl Grey Hot. After breakfast we hit the trail anticipating our climb up Mt Washington. Would the mountain top be in the clouds or would we have a view?
Right out of the gate this morning we had a challenging climb to the top of Mt Pierce with outstanding views. From there we came down to about 4000 feet and began the climb of Washington. At this point Washington is hiding behind Mt Eisenhower and we have to hike up and around it before we get our 1st glimpse. So hike we did and after some climbing we rounded a corner came out of the Balsam Firr and there it was enveloped in a cloud but just then the clouds parted and we got our first view of the day. You would have thought we had seen a mountain of gold as excited as we got. We continued our climb and after one of my wrong directions for the day we successfully reached the top of Mt. Washington. Wow! Fist bumps and pictures were had. Then we husseled into the grill and got some food and worked on charging devices. 
 
About noon we headed back to the trail. Our trail from about 1.5 miles before Mt Washington to Maddison Hut was one very long and difficult boulder scramble. They marked the trail with cairns and you just picked your way across the boulders from one cairn to the next. Somewhere in all those boulders was my second wrong direction of the day. My feet and knees were very weary by the time we reached the hut. We only had a reservation for one person at this hut. When we arrived we asked about any cancelations, yes they had one, we said we'll take it. We asked, how about work for stay,  she said yes, I said I'll take it. Now we are all three inside. Moments later she called me over and said they have some emergency use beds and she hated for my friends to get to eat while I had to wait, so she fixed me up with a bunk and I paid instead of worked for it. Now I get to eat with the paying guest.
Once I was settled in my bunk, I changed into dry clothes and took my wet ones outside to dry some. Soon it was supper time and I enjoyed another good meal. After supper I worked on the journal brushed my teeth and went to bed.

Up about 6:25am moments before our musical invitation to wake up. Got ready packed my backpack and got me a seat for breakfast. Oh, and a cup of Earl Grey hot. Once again right after breakfast we loaded up and hit the trail. 
The 1st climb of the day was back in the boulder fields and up in a very steep fashion. Again there are no blazes just cairns every so often and you pick your path between the cairns. It is slow going for us this morning and for the first mile and a half we are less than one mile per hour. We finally make it over Mt Madison and eventually the trail looks more like a trail. 
From that point at 5400 feet we spent the rest of our day going down. At times it was a rocky steep trail and at other times just a downhill trail. JFK was not feeling well so the closer we got to Pinkham Notch the more we were considering our options for the day. Pinkham Notch which originally was our halfway point in the day became our stop to eat and to discuss our plans. We determined that we could all use a rest and shower and with the predicted rain for tomorrow getting off trail made the most sense. While waiting for our shuttle to arrive Cruise Control came up and offered us some trail magic. She is hiking the AT this year but was taking a few days off. Once I introduced myself she said I met some of your family in New York doing trail magic. That was when Scott and Sarah and family along with Sharon came out to visit. I thought that was neat. Soon enough the shuttle driver arrived and delivered us to our Hotel in Gorham NH. 
For those of you with the keen eyes yes I had another fall. While attempting to cross a creek my right foot slid off the rock and I banged my shin good on another rock. However, no one was seriously injured in the making of this fall, thankfully. 
Today we hiked 7.8 miles, 23,749 steps, low 60° high 74°. Tomorrow we are planning a zero day. 319.6 miles to Katahdin.

Up about 8am, how's that for a start to a zero day. Made it in for the hotel breakfast and did pretty good. It was crowded and their microwave was out of order but I got plenty. Back in the room I relaxed for a while and then made another trip over to the Dollar General store mostly because I was out of ice cream cause I've heard somewhere that ice cream is the most important meal of the day. 
We took this zero day to rest our bodies and because it was supposed to rain most of the day. I rested and it rained. As the day went I looked at trail stuff on my phone, talked to my daughter and her wonderful children, took a nap, cleaned stuff in my pack, relaxed, watched a little TV, talked with Gorgeous and relaxed. Around 6:30pm we headed out to eat and when the 1st place we tried was booked until 8pm we were very happy to go back to the Road Hawg BBQ for some swine dinning. Back to the room I put my finishing touches on this journal entry and repacked my gear to be ready for our 6:45 departure in the morning.

Up this morning just before 6am got myself ready and was down for breakfast and ready to go when our shuttle driver arrived. He delivered us safely back to Pinkham Notch Visitors Center and we were on trail by around 7am.
Today's a planned short day because we have been hearing from those ahead of us that it can take 6 hours to do the Wildcat mountains. Best that I can figure out is that there is Wildcat D peak and Wildcat Mountain peak and between them is the Wildcat Ridge, that's what makes up The Wildcats. That's a distance of about 5 miles and a climb of about 3000 feet. We had heard all kinds of stories about having to put up your hiking poles and climb using your hands. So, we allowed plenty of time and got an early start.
It was a long steep climb and at times we did use our hands some to get up and over boulders, but we all agreed that it wasn't any harder or longer than some climbs we had done before. While climbing we were presented with several view spots looking back at Mt Washington, Mt Webster, Mt Madison and others we had climed in the last few days. They look so big and so far away it's hard to imagine that it was just days ago we were on them. 
Several of the downhill sections today were just as steep as the uphill parts and on occasion we would use a tree to help get us down a big boulder. We met a couple more south bounders today and traded trail info with them. Major and a friend passed us as they are doing a 21 mile slack pack today. I'm thankful it's not me doing that. After a nice long downhill section we made it to the Carter Notch Hut. You know I may not have mentioned one of the changes in terminology being used. The new term notch. Notch is New Hampshires way of saying a gap and a gap is the low place between mountain peaks. 
After arriving at the Hut we checked in, claimed our spots in the lower bunk house bunk room 4, and because we were early in the day we all got a lower bunk. Yea for us. Back in the main building we each had a bowl of lentil soup and a piece of crumb cake. Yum yum. After that I went back to the bunk house and took a short nap. Oh so nice. After naps I went down to the main building drank several glasses of lemonade, or that's what they call it, and sat outside visiting and watching the wildlife which included 4 snakes. Next came supper time and we had creamy tomato soup, bread, quinoa salad, corn, vegetable pot pie, and chocolate cookies. Very tasty. After supper I visited briefly with Buck, a fellow thru hiker and then headed for bed.
Today we hiked 5.9 miles, 18,931 steps, low 66° high 72°. Tomorrow I am aiming for US Route 2 at mile 1900.0 or 15.3 miles. 313.7 miles to Katahdin.

Up this morning just a few minutes before the Croo member played us a wake up tune on his fiddle. A good breakfast and some skits then we were on trail by about 7:30am. There was a little rain in the forecast this morning and we were eager to get as many miles in before it started. For this morning the sun was trying to chase the clouds away but was having a hard time. 
We headed out for our 1st big climb of the morning, Carter Dome. It was 1500 feet in just over a mile, pretty steep in places but not so bad. From the Hut you could see a rock ledge that occasionally you could see hikers on and when we reached that ledge I took a picture of the Hut. It looked way down there. Soon after that we were on Mt Hight but because of the clouds not much view. Then it was down a few steep sections then back up some pretty tough climbs to South Carter. 
 
View from the Carters
Lucy Goosie, I hiked through many sections of Christmas tree forests today and you will never guess what song was stuck in my head while hiking thru those trees. Give up? Deep and Wide. I think I did pretty good with the mmmm parts but I needed you there to make sure I got it right. 
After South Carter it was Middle Carter and then on to North Carter. We were blest with a few views as the sun kept chasing the clouds away and we kept climbing and descending each mountain. Then came the descent down North Carter and boy did it ever get exciting. It was steep, there were big boulders, and several sections we used our hands to grab trees and roots along the trail to ease us down. Fun, scary and VERY slow going. Once we made it to the bottom we started another tough climb up Mt Moriah. By then the clouds had won the battle with the sun so no views. We took the opportunity with cell signal to attempt to book a hotel room only to find no vacancies in the town of Gorham. The hike down from Mt Moriah was another tough one with some additional hand and tree work needed to get down. And down we went 2800 feet over 4 miles. I was beginning to think we would never stop going down. 
We met a few SOBO's again today and one trail named Forrest Gump was pretty fun. After hello he said you want to hear some jokes and proceeded to tell us 4 or 5 of them. Then we traded some trail info. I then asked him if he had some new shoes coming soon? He had two toes on each foot sticking out the side of his shoes. He has shoes coming very soon. 
About 1/4 of a mile from Rattle River Shelter it started to rain. We husseled on into the shelter where sisters were setting to get out of the rain. Our original plan was to hike to US ROUTE 2 another 2 miles from the shelter and go into town for the night to resupply. However, since there was no room in any of the Inns and there is room in the shelter, we decided to stay put at the shelter for the night and try to get to town in the morning. So I set up in the shelter, I've eaten and gathered water, and now I'm waiting for a break in the rain to hang our food bags. Then I will crawl into my bag and go night night.
Today we hiked 13.3 miles. 36,108 steps, low 63° high 67°. Tomorrow I am aiming for Gentian Pond Shelter at mile 1911.7 or 13.7 miles. 300.4 miles to Katahdin.

Up this morning before 6am because we wanted to get to town, resupply, and get back on trail as early as possible. So, we were on trail by 6:30am.
The trail to start our day was really nice and we made great time for that two miles. Once we made it to the road each of us contacted a different shuttle service with no immediate response. So we crossed the road and stuck out our thumb. Within 5 minutes a nice young lady went by hit her brakes, turned around and we became hitchhikers for the 1st time this trip and 1st time ever for me. Amy, our driver is a hiker and was on her way for a day hike when she saw us. She said she regularly picks up hikers. She was great and dropped us off at Walmart in Gorham for our resupply. 
 
Our 1st Hitchhike With Amy
Once we had resupplied JFK made contact with Rob a shuttle driver we had used before and by 9:45am we were back on trail loaded with food. And that's when it happened. We hit the 1900 mile mark. Yes indeed we have now hiked more the 1900 miles, incredible!Then just before we started into the woods we got Trail Magic!  I think she went by Trail Magic Momma and she had donuts, fruit, coffee and Gatorade. Yum yum. Our 1st climb today was around 1800 feet and had a couple of very steep places but overall was just a big climb. Then we had some rolling ups and downs but what was most notable was the fact that there was actually a trail for us to hike not just rocks and boulders to climb. There were also a couple of great views today, which by the way we were blest with another beautiful sunny day. It felt like we have finally lost a little of the humidity that has been hanging around. Once again today we crossed paths with some SOBO'S  and it's always interesting to get there take on the trail in Maine.
Later in the day we had another pretty steep and long climb this time with lots of steep slab rocks as well as several places of boulder scrambles. I was happy to finally get to the top of that one and our map doesn't even give it a name. Then down we came with several places we needed to grab trees or roots to help us get down. 
With around 4 miles left we we started seeing ponds and then lots of bogs that had wood planks for us to cross the bogs. However, some of the planks were rotten and some were just under water so that section was interesting. Finally about 4:30pm we rolled into the shelter for tonight and even though it had several hikers already in it we claimed spots on the upper deck. This shelter has a great view right out the front and a pond just down the hill a bit. About 6pm I ate and shortly after that I was in my bag resting. 
Today we hiked 13.7 miles, 35,637 steps, low 54° high 67°. Tomorrow I am aiming for Full Goose Shelter 1921.3. 286.7 miles to Katahdin.

Up this morning right at 6am because thats when someone's alarm went off. I got busy and packed up, ate and we were on trail by 7am. Our day didn't have a bunch of miles in it but once again the climb was going to be well over 4000 foot.
Our 1st big climb was Mt Success and it had several good steep climbs and lots of boulders to hike over. It's tradition on the AT that as you near a state line the trail gets very challenging. That way you remember the state as being hard. New Hampshire gave us some of her best challenges as we worked our way out. Maine was not going to be outdone so she started us off with steep rock slabs, ladders normally with most of the rungs still attached, rebar to aid in our descent and lots of boards to walk on. We used our hands, trees and roots several times both going up and especially coming down. 
We met a nice family of 4, Mom, Dad and two boys who are out for a section on top of one of the Goose Mt's. They out for 10 days. We also met a couple of SOBO'S Jet and Hendrix, its always nice to visit with them and hear what they have experienced thus far. I know right now you are amazed that I remembered their trail names. However, I am acquainted with two outstanding men with those names and that makes it easier. 
The big event for this day was crossing the state line into Maine. Pictures were taken fist bumps were had and the Thumb Booty dance was done. We are now in our last state of this hike. It is incredible to think that we have come this far. And, at this point in my hike I'm ready to get to the end. I'm having a great time, looking forward to the next few days, but my body is tired.
Another fun thing today was seeing a couple of grouse. He was strutting his stuff for her, but she already had at least two young ones so she wasn't acting very interested. It was quite entertaining for a few minutes. 
We rolled into the shelter after climbing our last ladder for the day, about 1:15. It took us six hours to cover almost 10 miles and we beat the rain by about 30 minutes. We claimed our spots and after the rain made the long hike down for water. It cooled down some after the rain and I got chilled so on came the puffy jacket. It looks like we'll have another full shelter tonight and it's supposed to get to the low 50's tonight. Ought to be good sleeping weather. 
Today we hiked 9.6 miles, 26,881 steps, low 56° high 62°. Tomorrow we are aiming for Grafton Notch at miles 1931.0 or 9.7 miles. 277.1 miles to Katahdin.

Up this morning about 5:45am then laid back down until 6am. Did the morning routine and was on trail by about 7am. It was a cool night for sleeping and a cool morning to start hiking. And, today is our five month anniversary of starting this journey. It just adds one more thing to the list of things that are hard to believe. You the reader have been following me for five months. This is and has been an amazing journey and I am very thankful that you are following it. Just a few more days and Lord willing we will be on Katadyn. 
I was very excited to get going this morning. For the past ten years I've read and watched hikers go thru the Mahoosuc Notch.  It is described as about a mile long trail that winds its way through a deranged jumble of boulders, and that is exactly what it was. It was by far the most fun mile of the trail. I felt like a kid in a really big jungle gym. That was a fun fun hour and a half. 
 
Me Playing in the Mahoosuc Notch 
Right after that is when the work began. It was time to climb the Mahoosuc Arm, 1600 feet of up and just to make it fun Maine thru in all the trail types with a extra dose of boulders and rock slabs. A quote I read on our FarOut app said, was it steep? Yes, was it long? Yes, was it hard? Yes, but its not anything that you haven't already done. And that accurately describes the Arm.
Next was Old Speck mountain and it was a handful also, but again nothing that we haven't already done. There were some great views as we neared the top of Old Speck along with a cool breeze. Its interesting to me that on the last few mountain top areas there have been bogs. In my mind the bogs belong in the low lands not on top of the mountains. 
McDuck made contact with a shuttle driver from up on Old Speck so we now had room reservations and a way into town. All we now needed to do was hike down the 4 miles. As we began to meet hikers coming up the trail they told us there was trail magic at the road. Trail Magic here we come. Sure enough Moose Boy and Crafty Girl were cooking burgers and they had watermelon, chips, and drinks. Yum yum! Thank you guys so much for your kindness to hikers. As soon as we finished our burgers we were loaded up and brought to town. First town chore was resupply next was checking in to the Motel and finally go get more food. Once that was accomplished we were able to start the laundry. While that was going we worked on journals and getting ourselves cleaned up.
Today we hiked 9.7 miles, 25,753 steps, low 51° high 65°. Tomorrow I am aiming for Hail Mountain Lean To at mile 1947.3 or 16.3 miles. 267.4 miles to Katahdin.

Up this morning at 6am to get ready, eat, and be in the shuttle by 7am. We were dropped off and on trail by 7:30. The Motel we stayed at last night was very adequate and the owner was very accommodating. He shuttle us to town for supper and back to the trail this morning for no extra charge. More good trail magic!
We had a big day planned with might near 6000 foot of climb included. As I said my prayers last night I asked God again for safety and for the energy to complete the day planned. So with a little trepidation I crossed the road and started my first climb for today. It was a long but not so difficult of a climb up to the top of Baldpate West and we were rewarded with excellent views. Then down a ways and then you could see Baldpate East and the climb waiting for us there. It was almost entirely on rock slabs. Again loads of views where we could see many of the mountains we have crossed and those we will climb soon. We had been blest with another absolutely beautiful cool day to hike in. Then we started a very long mostly downhill section that for the most part was good trail. We made some decent time through that section and that helped us make it to the shelter a bit earlier than I expected. God had been blest again with safety and the energy to complete our miles for the day.
I stopped just before the shelter and gathered my water for the evening then claimed my spot in the shelter. Soon I ate my supper, brushed my teeth and hung our food bags for the night. 
As we hiked today we met a bunch more Sobo's and have filtered into a new group of Nobo's. Always interesting to see how that works. Several of them are tenting tonight which leaves us plenty of space in the shelter. For those of you with the keen eyes, yes I added another fall yesterday. I went down in Mahoosuc Notch. Doesn't appear to be any permanent damage.

Up about 6am to do all the fun morning chores and on trail by about 7am. We had worked on a couple of plans for today, one about 12 miles to a shelter and one about 17 miles to a road where we would get picked up and taken to a hotel. How the day went and when the rain started would be key decision makers. 
We started our day with a nice downhill before our 1st climb up to Moody Mountain. It set the stage for how this day was going to be, uphill and tough then a tough downhill to follow. Then came the climb up Old Blue 2200 feet and it was a lot of work. Rebar, ladders and long steep climbs made it a difficult climb. We enjoyed a few places where there was a view and at the top was a whole group of Nobo's. Carlos, Point Man, Major, Burrito, Sour Patch, Smiles and Major. We all ended up at the next creek refilling water bottles. It's always interesting how you cross paths with different hikers at different times. 
 
Trail Up Baldpate 
We hiked on reaching the top of Bemis Mountain heading down to the Bemis Lean To so we could make the final call on what we were going to do. And even though we were really worn down the call of town food and sleeping in a real bed persuaded us to push on five more miles to ME Route 17. JFK had secured rooms in Rangeley and  McDuck had found us a shuttle. Kim, our shuttle driver was very kind and volunteered to take us by the grocery store before taking us to the hotel. 
We got checked in and soon McDuck and I were headed down to the Pine Tree Frosty for a burger or two. It was a short walk back to the hotel where I jumped in the shower and got warm and cleaned up. Unlike the extreme heat those of you in Oklahoma are suffering through we are having cool temps. Then I ate the steak salad and one of the avocados I had purchased at the IGA. Then for a snack I had a third of a block of extra sharp cheese and lots of Tostitos chips along with some peanut M&M's
Sarah this paragraph is for you. From out of nowhere I started singing Let Me Call You Sweetheart and remembering those Dad and Daughter Camp Fire nights, eating moms fried chicken. It never ceases to amaze me what my mind comes up with while hiking. Anyway I passed a few miles singing and remembering those events.  I even did a little trail version of the Hoky Poky.  Great memories!
Another tough tough day of hiking successfully completed. Thank the dear Lord for that. I'm working on my journal entry and will get my pack unpacked since we get to slack pack tomorrow.  The downside is that it is supposed to rain most of tomorrow so I'll be a wet rat when we're done.

The alarm woke me from a good sleep at 6:15am. Got myself busy and was ready when Kim our shuttle driver arrived. She dropped us off at ME Route 17 where she picked us up yesterday and into the woods we went. 
We started the day in a light rain and the trail took us uphill for a short while. Today's trail was pretty mild at least compared to what we had done the previous days. We had several climbs but nothing too long or steep and the same for the downhill sections. What we did have plenty of was mud, bogs and water holes. All of that takes me back to the title of today's journal. No Rain, No Pain, No Maine. That is one of the popular AT sayings and for us it's definitely true. For us the last couple of months have seen record amounts of rain for this part of the world. In the pain category each of us are dealing with foot pain in some form or fashion along with other body part pain from falls or just over use. In the Maine category we're in Maine! So, No Rain, No Pain No Maine. 

 
Rain Drops Keep Falling On My Head 
We saw a few SOBO's today and I remember one name B Minus. We caught up and passed Burrito, Sour Patch, Smiles, Major and Blues Clues. At one point I walked up on 10 or so young girls out for a few days hiking. It seemed to be a busy day on the trail. Then as I came out of the woods to the parking area at the trailhead there was TRAIL MAGIC! Snags, a thru hiker last year, had hotdogs, Little Debbie snacks, drinks and a place to sit down. So so nice! Thanks for your kindness to hikers. 
It wasn't much longer before Dave our shuttle driver this afternoon showed up and delivered us back to the hotel. It didn't take me long to get out of my wet stuff, get showered and start in on my snacks. After that I just kicked back and relaxed for a while. We walked down to town and had supper and stopped by to get ice cream cause I've heard somewhere that ice cream is the most important meal of the day. We made the walk up the hill to the hotel and I got my feet up and rested till bed time.

I didn't open my eyes till 7am this morning and that was nice. I worked on cleaning water filter, water bottles, spoon and other items. About 8am we walked up the hill to the IGA for our resupply. The it was a walk back down the hill to the hotel and pack all that food up and be ready when Dave our shuttle driver arrives. He made it right at 10am and we were on trail about 10:30am.
We started our day with a nice 2500 foot climb up to the top of Saddleback Mountain. We were above the tree line and views were all around. There was a little haze but it was a beautiful mountain top. From there we went down a little and then up to the Horn peak. I enjoyed this part of the trail because you can see where you are going and where you've been. Most of the way we continued to enjoy the views. Then it was time for one of those crazy scary downhill sections. I must have thought to myself 10 times, really we're supposed to go down this, and we did. Then we had some climbing to do to get to the top of Saddleback Junior as well as more of the tough downhill stuff. We also had lots more of the mud and boggy areas today making it slow going. We finally rolled in around 3:45 pm ready to be done for the day. 
Once we started getting our spots claimed in the shelter we spotted Butterfly a section hiker that we have been seeing some and met Mary Poppins for the first time. We also caught and passed Burrito and Sour Patch again today. JFK and Butterfly built a fire for us cause it was 60° and cool. Boy did that feel so nice. I got to eat the two sandwiches I packed out setting around the fire. It won't be long before I'm in the sack.

My first peek out of my bag this morning was just after 5am, my next peek was 6am and all the occupants were up so I got up. After morning chores we were on trail by 7am.
It was a downhill start for the early part of our day as we made our way down to Orbeton stream and pulled off the socks and shoes and put on our water shoes so we could ford the stream. We all successfully made the crossing. 
Then we started a long journey up Mt Abraham and Spaulding mountain. Only a couple of short sections were tough with the rest of it not so bad. During this climb McDuck mentioned rain on Tuesday and that must have got JFK thinking because after a little bit he said let's talk. He explained his concern about the rain and how maybe we could hike the Bigelows on Monday a nice day and perhaps do a short day on Tuesday in the rain. We all agreed and our day changed that fast. 
On our way down Spaulding mountain we found the 2000 mile marker. Actually we found a couple of them and now we have officially hiked over 2000 miles. Pictures and fist bumps were shared all around. The last part of the downhill from Spaulding was more of the wicked bad stuff. We used all of our downhill skills on it. As we neared the bottom we got near a creek and I wondered if we would get to ford again today. It was a wide creek but with the help of a board we were able to cross with dry feet. 
We made it to Caribou road and walked the half mile or so to the parking area and waited for our shuttle. Kerry, Jo and Felix the dog were also there waiting for the same shuttle. When Gen, our shuttle driver arrived we all piled in the car and to the town of Stratton we came. They put the three of us up in the bunkhouse that is part of the Motel in Stratton and which is across the street from the grocery store and a restaurant. What could be better than that? We immediately went to the grocery store because it would close in one hour and then later went over to the restaurant. After that I  finished my journal entry and headed for the bed. They pick is up at 6:30am in the morning.

The alarm went off at 5:30am this morning so that we could get around and be ready for our shuttle at 6:30am. We were ready and the shuttle was on time.  It was about an hours drive to our drop off and a long ways walk back to town. We ended up on trail by about 7:45am.
We were slack packing south bound today and our initial trail was very nice. We moved along and gained altitude fairly quickly. It didn't take long for things to change. Our 1st mountain Little Bigelow never got crazy it just finished out nice and steep. There were some nice views but the Canadian smoke was fairly thick today. The start of the climb down was tough before it mellowed out and we had some nice trail again. 
Then came the climb up to Bigelow Avery Peak and then Bigelow West Peak. Were they long? Yes. Were they steep? Yes. Were they hard? Yes. But we made it and the views even with the smoke in the air were spectacular. Lots of water on one side and endless mountains on the other. Plus you could see the next peak we would be on which is always cool. One of the extra treats today was blueberries. The bushes were loaded and some of the berries were nice sized.  They all were delicious! The last couple of days while on top of the mountains I've had something happen to me that hasn't happened in years, many many years. My hair getting blown into my eye. A new old experience.
 
View of the Lake From the Bigelows 
Coming down from those peaks again provided sections that were as the locals would say wicked bad. There were several places where there were a jumble of big boulders and steep drops. I kept telling myself no slippy fallies. We saw lots of hikers today since we were hiking south bound including Spartacus, Smile, Burrito, Sour Patch, Major and Blues Clues. 
Then it was another steep climb up to the South Horn Peak with more great views and yet more frightening descents. Then it was a long long downhill hike to ME Route 27 where we got picked up by Jen. Moments later we were back at the hotel hostel getting showers. I said hotel hostel because we are staying at the Roadhouse Hostel except they have put us up in the hotel they own in the bunkhouse portion of the hotel. We like this choice as we kinda have the place to ourselves. 
After showers McDuck and JFK went to get snacks and pizza for our dinner. The pizza was so good I ate a whole one. Then we watched a episode of Ramdeno a guy on YouTube that follows the hiking community. McDuck sends him our location once a week and he mentions it during his episodes. I worked on my journal and relaxed before heading to bed. 
Today we hiked 16.6 miles, 42,393 steps, low 59° high 70°. Tomorrow we are planning a zero day since it is supposed to rain most of the day. 188.4 miles to Katahdin.

Up just after 6am on my zero day isn't what I would call ideal however, when it involves an all you can eat breakfast I'm willing to make the sacrifice. A shuttle was sent over to pick us up and take us to the actual Roadhouse Hostel where breakfast was being served.  Blueberry pancakes, hashbrown casserole, scrambled eggs, sausage, watermelon and cantaloupe made for a great breakfast. 
Once I finished breakfast I started our laundry and have learned if you stand in front of the machine and appear bewildered you get lots of help. Laundry in I joined the other hikers in the den and we talked all things hiking. When moving the clothes from washer to dryer I secured our transportation back to the hotel portion of this hostel. Once the clothes were dry I matched up socks to make sure we had all of them and back we came. 
Once at the hostel I snacked a little watched a couple of YouTube videos by a hiker we've met and napped. Around 1pm I ate again and relaxed by keeping off my feet. Made a trip back to the store for avocados and ice cream and did much of nothing the rest of the day. As predicted by the local weather people it rained all day. It was so nice to be inside and not out hiking in it. Later McDuck and I crossed the highway and had supper at the Backstrap. Afterwards I was stuffed and just sat on the couch till bedtime.

Up just after 6am again this morning cause I sure didn't want to miss our ride to breakfast. She was right on time and on our way to the hostel she told us they had received 6 inches of rain yesterday. And by the look of the creeks you could believe it. That kinda made us anxious for how the trail would be today. But first it was breakfast, scrambled eggs, waffles, strawberries, blueberries, and bacon, all you could eat. Yum yum! Then they shuttled us to our starting point for the day.
We had about a half mile road walk before we got to the trail and upon observing the creeks along the way our hopes for the trail improved. Sure enough the trail was wet and muddy and even a shallow stream in places, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. So into the wet woods we went around 9am. Immediately we started our climb and it was to last around 3 miles. Not a bad climb but it did get good and steep towards the top of South Crocker.  Views were hard to come by  because of the clouds but we got some. Then it was down some before heading up to North Crocker. It was a similar climb steep towards the top. 
 
View From South Crocker 
Then for the next 5 or so miles it was downhill for us. Nothing very steep or hard just lots of muddy spots to work around. Around 1pm we arrived at the trailhead and waited on our shuttle which arrived quickly. Jen dropped us off and I got cleaned up then I went to the grocery store for some lunch. Soon Jen came and got us to do some of our resupply at their hostel especially since they have Spam singles. About 6pm Jen brought us their Suburban to use for the rest of the evening and then we could drive ourselves to breakfast in the morning. The two Jen's have just been overwhelming kind and accommodating to us these past few days. I'm very greatful for their kindness. We drove ourselves down to restaurant and had a great meal. Back to the hotel it was get organized and pack up cause tomorrow is full pack time again.

Up again just after 6am cause we didn't want to miss breakfast this morning at the hostel. Since the Jan's had left us their Suburban we could head that way as soon as we had everything packed up. We were a few minutes early arriving at the hostel so we visited for a while with Veggie, Butterfly, Tonto, and to our surprise Jukebox. Luna his dog had to go home and rest her sore paws. For breakfast this morning we had blueberry pancakes, eggs benedict, grits, asparagus, mushrooms, pineapple and strawberries, and yes I had some of all of it with seconds on most of it.
After breakfast they loaded us up for the long drive to our starting place. Once we got there we found trail magic. We were all so full from breakfast that we didn't take much but still want to say a big thanks for taking care of hikers. Jen gave each of us a big hug before sending us into the woods. I'll describe our hike this way. Was it long? Yes. Was it steep? No. Was it muddy? Very. Was it hard? Kinda. In places I thought I was back in Vermont wading the muddy trails. There were a couple of nice long sections that was pretty good trail and we made good time on those sections. 
We arrived at Harrison's Pierce Pond Cabins not an official AT place but just off the trail .3 miles. We got checked in with Tim the owner and he took us to our cabins. He has a main house with kitchen dining hall and den area and then 5 or so cabins. No electricity in the cabins but he has a generator that provides electricity to the main house and hot water for showers. In the morning we get all the pancakes we can eat starting at 7am sharp. It's a beautiful setting right on a river, very rustic. Once we got our stuff situated we went over to the main house and had whatever we brought to eat for supper. Tim had a cookie and some pink lemonade for each of us. After eating I made my way up to the shower house and got cleaned up. It sure felt good. Then back to McDuck and my cabin to work on this journal and go to bed.

Up just after 6am to get myself ready for breakfast cause Tim the owner said 7am sharp and I didn't want to be late. There were a few of us including Lone Wolf, Sonic, Prince Charming, Little Fruity, Captin Nemo and the three of us all eagerly waiting for our pancakes. When the moment arrived I was amazed at the plate of 13 big pancakes each person received. And if that wasn't enough you also got 3 sausage links and scrambled eggs. What does one do with that much food? You eat it, and yes I did every last bite. In fact at least half of us ate every last bite. Wow, that was a bunch of pancakes. 
After that breakfast we put on our packs and waddled down the trail. We hiked near and along creeks most of the day and that included the times the trail was the creek. When you're that near creeks you get the opportunity to cross those creeks and sometimes it's an easy rock hop, sometimes it was a very challenging or even scary rock hop and one time it was in a canoe. We were ferried across the Kennebec River by Greg. It's another one of the iconic AT things that I looked forward to doing, and now I've done it!
 
Getting ready to cross the Kennebec 
It was another day best describe as a muddy walk in the woods. We walked the short side trail down to Pleasant Pond Lean To to discuss our options for the rest of the day. After much discussion we settled on the original plan of staying at this Lean To. If you have noticed in Maine the shelter type structures we stay in are called Lean To's. They look like shelters, sleep like shelters, and smell like shelters, but they call them Lean To's. Why, I have no clue. 
After a bit Butterfly showed up and found her a tent spot. Next it was Major and Blues Clues, they stopped to discuss their options and they decided to do a bunch of road walking to get off these muddy trails, and off they went in search of the road. We spent some interesting even humerus moments trying to dry our clothes in the brief amount of sunshine we had. Around 5pm I ate my dinner brushed my teeth and hung the bear bags. That has me ready for bed before 6pm.

Up just before 6am to get myself ready for another day of hiking. We were on the muddy trail just before 7am and on our 1st climb not long after that. It was Pleasant Pond Mountain and 1000 foot of climb. Not a bad climb and we had less mud as we went up. The real surprise was the abundance of blueberries as we got near the top and all the way over the top. The bushes were loaded and there were some nice ones. Sometimes its the steep climb that slows you down and sometimes it's the roots and rocks. Today it was the blueberries. 
So we ate our way over that mountain then hiked on to Middle Mountain where we did the blueberry thing all over again. Oh, by the way, there were some nice views from the tops of all the mountains today. Still a bit hazy but beautiful. Then it was a lengthy downhill to Baker Stream that we were supposed to ford. However, because of high water the ATC recommended that we do a walk around and we did just that. While walking the road some of the people that lived there told us we had made the right choice. Good to know.
Then it was up again 1500 feet to the top of Moxie Bald Mountain and yes you guessed it, more blueberries. I walked a little and picked a little till we had made it all the way across the summit. That was quite a unexpected treat for today. Then it was back down 1400 feet, some of which was pretty steep, to the Bald Mountain Pond Lean To where we claimed spots in the shelter and began the process of trying to dry our hiking clothes. Not long after we arrived Butterfly came in and the a flip flopped from Texas called Rope.
After supper me, JFK and Butterfly went down to the pond, which is actually a lake, and looked for Loons and Moose. We saw And heard the Loons but no Moose.

Up about 5:45am cause I really needed to go to the bathroom. It was raining lightly as it had been since about 12:30am. I could see that Butterfly was just about packed up and she came up to the shelter to see what our plans were for fording the rivers today. I told her we were going to do the walk arounds recommended by the ATC and ford the others. She thought that sounded good and headed off. We did our morning thing and got on trail about 7am.
The trail this morning was back to a muddy mess and that makes us move slower as you are always having to pick your path. We reached Bald Mountain Stream which we would have to ford and looked it over carefully, put on our water shoes and across we went. For me it looked worse than it actually was. There was plenty of current but it was shallow enough not to be a problem. Once we all successfully crossed then we continued hiking the muddy trail. 
About 5 miles into our hike was the start of our walk around. This one put us on an old logging road that also had some damage from the heavy rains. We hadn't been on the road long when we saw Butterfly up ahead trying to wring water out of her tent. We were surprised to see her since she left an hour or so before us. When we asked what she was doing she proceeded to tell us a very frightening story of her fording of Bald Mountain Stream. On her attempt she slipped and fell the current taking her and her backpack under the water. She was able to separate herself from her pack and eventually made it to the shore with her pack. She gathered her wits and picked a different place and crossed successfully the second try. She was wet and her stuff was wet making her pack extra heavy so JFK tried very hard to convince her to let us carry some of that wet gear for her. She would not let us so we all finished out that portion of the road walk together. Finally just before we got back in the woods for the last 6 or so miles JFK persuaded her to let us help carry some of the wet stuff. We then headed on up the muddy trail. A couple of miles before our stopping place we heard thunder and the race was on. We did get sprinkled on some but we beat the rain. 
We all were headed to Shaw's hostel and it wasn't long before the shuttle driver arrived and delivered us to Shaw's. We checked in made our way to our room and found us some loaner clothes so we could get out of our wet stuff. It wasn't long before we headed to town in search of food. Once that was accomplished it was back to Shaw's to get laundry started and journal entries done. Once laundry is finished it will be bed time for me.
Today we hiked 17.9 miles, 42,361 steps, low 68° high 72°. Tomorrow I am aiming for a zero. Got to get organized and rested for the 100 mile wilderness.  114.7 miles to Katahdin.

Up about 6:30am as the kitchen our room was near got busy. Breakfast was served at 7am and we sat at the table with Major, her husband and Blues Clues. Breakfast was 3 fried eggs, bacon, fried taters blueberry pancakes and orange juice. Very tasty. 
Before I forget, once we get into the 100 mile wilderness they claim there is little to no cell service. Thus you may not hear from me for a few days. I will post my entries as cell signal allows. 
Around noon we journeyed up to the General Store for lunch and to pick up a few supplies. After that I took a short nap. Then I went to Shaw's resupply room and got 5 days worth of food to get me through the 100 Mile Wilderness. We will carry a couple of days worth of food out with us in the morning and in a couple of days they will bring out the rest of the food to a designated road for us. That will help to keep our packs from being sooooo heavy. I did my best to stay off my feet today as the next 5 days I will spend lots of time on them. It's hard to believe that this time next week, Lord willing, I will be a Thru Hiker. Around 5pm we headed back to town which is about a two block walk to get another sandwich from the General store. After that we crossed the street to get ice cream cause I've heard somewhere that ice cream is the most important meal of the day. Back to the hostel I worked on my journal and started repacking my pack. I've relaxed all day and I'm not far from turning it in for the night.

Up this morning around 6:15am as the kitchen got busy again. Got dressed finished packing my backpack and found me a seat at one of the tables. Breakfast was identical to yesterdays and every bit as good. Between breakfast and time for the shuttle we had time to visit. We were dropped off at the trailhead around 8:30am and away we went. 
Our 1st encounter today was the sign that says we're entering the 100 mile wilderness and that it was scary and dangerous and we needed at least 10 days of food. I have 2 days of food on me and will have 3 more delivered in a couple of days as we plan to be out of the Wilderness in 5 days. We hiked on till we reached Little Wilson Falls where we picked up a side trail to take us to the work around of the river ford. The ATC recommended the walk around because of high river levels. I liked that advice as well as we would be off the muddy, rocky, rooty trail and on paved and gravel roads. And to make it even better it wasn't any additional miles. With the expert navigation by McDuck we traversed blue blazed trail, gravel roads, paved roads, private gravel roads, and unmarked trails around the river and back to the White blazed trail we belong on. 
 
After getting back on trail it wasn't long before we were climbing the Barren Ledges where we crossed the 2100 mile mark. Pictures and first bumps were had all around and a little Thumb Booty dancing was done. After that celebration it wasn't far to our shelter for tonight. We claimed our spots and gathered water for the night. I ate my supper and got the bear bag rope hung before retiring to my bag to finish my journal. 
And as you can tell by the fall count I went down again today. No one was injured in the making of this fall. I was hoping to average not more than 1fall per state. I'm now at that number so no more falls for me.
Today we hiked 19.2 miles, 43,921 steps, low 68° high 72°. Tomorrow I am aiming for Carl Newhall Lean To at mile 2119.8 or 16.9 miles. 95.5 miles to Katahdin.

Up at 5:45am cause I heard rustling, so I started rustling myself. Around 7am we were on trail. It was a beautiful clear sunny morning and we had a few mountains to climb and at least one river to ford, so away we went. 
The first two mountains, Chairback Third and Columbus Mountains were fairly easy climbs and we were rewarded with excellent views and more blueberries. Coming down off of Columbus provided us with some difficult sections but all and all it was not bad. Then we made it over to Chairback Mountain for more views and blueberries. Coming down again were some challenging down sections especially when we arrived in the rockslide area. Steep downhill, big big boulders and a scramble down to a normal trail. 
 
Big Boulder Scramble 
Then it was down a nice grade for about 4 miles to a very wide creek that we were able to ford as it didn't ever get knee deep. Once across that creek we then started a long climb up Gulf Hagus Mountain. It is 2700 foot tall but we got to stop at 1900 feet because thats where our shelter is for tonight. It was empty when we arrived so we claimed our spots and then gathered water for the evening. It had rained on us for about 15 minutes while we hiked and as the evening wore on it rained a couple more times.

Up this morning a 5:45 hoping to be on trail before 7am and we were on trail about 6:45am. We needed to be at Johnson Pond Road by 3pm, 15 miles up trail. We knew we had four mountains to climb between here and there and wanted to allow enough time. 
So off we hiked on a grey damp misty kind of day. We climbed up for awhile and then we climbed down for awhile nothing very spectacular. I have noticed in the last few days that when climbing I don't feel as strong. I  can climb without stopping but it feels more like I'm slogging through rather than powering up. I think my legs are getting tired after the Whites and the Mountains in Maine. 
There were no views as we hiked today but we did find more blueberries. I was disappointed on most of the mountain peaks that there weren't any blueberries but very surprised to find them in one of the sections that had big pines in it. We also walked in sections of Christmas trees most of them under 4 foot tall. They are so cute!
Around 2:30pm we made it to the road for our food drop and Longshot was there waiting on us. He had our food bucket, three cans of cold Coke, and surprise a large cheese pizza. I can't tell you how wonderful that was. He did that as trail magic for us. We scarfed down the pizza and Coke, loaded up our resupply of groceries and was back on trail in about twenty minutes. 
Just before 4pm we rolled into the shelter area and found it empty so we claimed our spots and got set up. It is a beautiful spot with Cooper Brooke 25 feet in front of the shelter. Just upstream from the shelter is a series of rapid falls about 50 yards long. Really pretty and great sounds. I gathered water from a very small spring near the shelter and then got off my weary feet. A little later I had my delicious and nutritious supper hung our bear bags and moved my wet clothes that were hung in the trees to hanging places in the shelter. All my chores done it was time to relax until bed time.

Up at 5am, we had lots of miles to cover and we were hoping to beat some of the rain. We made the miles but it was raining on us before we ever got out of camp.
The first ten miles was pretty flat and mostly a good trail. There was the occasional muddy spot but we were able to cover some miles. We hiked by big streams and lakes most of the rest of the day with a couple of short climbs thrown in for entertainment. When we were down near the stream it was very muddy, rocky and rooty making it difficult to move quickly. The rain stayed with us all day but it never got very heavy it just kept us wet all day. Because of the rain there were no views for us today. It was kind of funny as we hiked past a sign that pointed to a place for viewing Katadyn, not today. I managed to have a hard fall again today, nothing serious but I'll have a sore shoulder and hip for a day or two. I was by myself and got wedge on my back and side in the rocks and couldn't get out. It was funny once I knew I wasn't broken. 
After getting on trail by 6am we rolled into the shelter wet and tired about 2:45pm. We claimed our spots got our sleeping pads and bags out then went and gathered water. It wasn't long after that when the rain started coming down in buckets. We crawled into our bags for a nap, which turned out to be a short one as two other wet hikers came and joined us in the shelter. Around 5:30pm I scarfed down my supper wishing I had more but not tonight. When the rain quit we hung our food bags and then did my best to stay out of my bag until 7pm.

Up this morning at 5am cause we got a long way to go today. I packed everything up and was on trail by 6am. 
The first point of interest today is my first look at Katahdin. It was a beautiful morning and I was very hopeful for a good look at the mountain. Sure enough there it was, the final destination for this hike. My FarOut app said it was about 12 miles away as the crow flies but about 30 miles away trail miles. I told it to wait right where it was cause I was coming for it.
That spot was about two miles in and at the end of a nice steep climb. From there it was only 21 more miles to Abol Bridge. After all the rain we had yesterday evening the trail was a mushy muddy mess and that makes for slow going. We had been told that our last 15 miles would be pretty easy trail. I'm not sure what they think easy is because we dodged rocks, roots, and mud nearly all day.
The Abol store closes at 6pm so we were hustling along to make sure we got there in time to resupply before they closed. Just about a half hour before we reached Abol it started raining. As we came out of the woods and on to the road there was a car waiting and as we approached it the window rolled down and a familiar voice said, you want some pizza. It was Longshot and YES we want some pizza. We each scarfed down a couple of slices and the headed up to the Abol store. JFK got us situated with a ""cabin"", which is one small room with 3 sets of bunks.  It also includes a shower and breakfast. 
Not long after that our families arrived and it was soooooi very good to see them especially Gorgeous. They brought us each a burger and it was very good. JFK, McDuck and me took showers and got ready to go eat pizza with the others. After pizza we went and picked up Matthew's gear. Matthew is McDuck's son and he plans to hike with us the next two days. Once he was ready the ladies dropped us back at our cabin for the night.

Up again at 5am, this has to stop I need my beauty rest, cause we want to get in line for the Birches. They only take 12 AT thru hikers each day to camp at The Birches and it was key to our plan that we get in. We were at the kiosk where you sign up which was about 1/2 mile up the road by 6am and we were 1st in line. At 7am a very friendly Ranger opened up the sign up sheet and I was thrilled that we got a spot in the Birches, that problem was solved. Mr Ranger explained all the rules and gave us helpful tips for today and summit day. The important tip was be back at the kiosk before 9am headed to Baxter State Park. We then headed back to the Abol store for breakfast. After breakfast it was back to the kiosk and the Ranger to sign in that we were actually on our way to Baxter. A somewhat convoluted process but it worked. 
Then we were off and in the woods. Matthew, McDuck's son, joined us today and the 4 of us were soon stopping to put on bug repellent as the sketters were thick. The trail was pretty good all day with just a few places of mud. We hiked next to streams and rivers most of the day and when you could look up from the roots and rocks it was really nice to see and hear the water. We caught a few glimpses of Katahdin as we hiked but her top was always in the clouds. 
It wasn't much longer when we rolled into Katahdin Stream Campground and found the Ranger station. He was out for awhile and we were instructed to go to the Birches Lean To's and wait till 2pm to be back at the Ranger station. We got all situated at thr Lean To and snacked on stuff till 2pm. There were 7 of us that gathered at the station for our Ranger visit and to get our park pass. The three of us, Major, Blues Clues, and James and Claire from Ireland. I am thru hiker number 426 to hike Katahdin. Then we filtered water and made our way back to the Lean To.  It wasn't long after that when McDuck's family and Gorgeous arrived with Cherry Coke and burgers. Yum yum! We ate and visited until The Ranger came up to give us his tips for our summit and exit from the park tomorrow. After that the family headed off and McDuck and JFK went to help Matthew set up his tent for the night. I finished my journal entry which will get posted when I have cell service hopefully tomorrow. 
Today we hiked 9.8 miles, 29,127 steps, low 66° high 68°. Tomorrow we are aiming for the summit of Katahdin at mile 2198.4 or 5.3 miles. Then we get to come back down off the mountain but those miles don't count. It is 5.3 miles to the summit of Katahdin!!!!
Until Tomorrow.","Abol Bridge

Up at 5am cause that's just what we seem to do. We wanted to be on our way up the mountain called Katahdin by 6:30am and we needed to drop off anything we did not want to carry up the mountain at the Ranger station. With that accomplished off we went on this final hike. It was a cloudy warm morning and we were hopeful for sunshine and calm winds as we started our climb. 
I've read hundreds of journals describing this day and watched many more on YouTube and it started off with a weird feeling of having been here before. That feeling didn't last long as the reality of the trail took over. The first mile was mostly good trail, then came the start of the climb along with mud, rocks and roots. As we got higher we began to feel the breeze and moisture in the air. We stopped at mile two and drank a liter of water and refilled our water bottles for the final push up the mountain. 
The technical climbing began and we put away our hiking poles and started using our hands. There was a place or two where rebar or a special shaped piece of metal was formed and attached to the boulders to aid in our climbing. By this time the fog has visibility to 20 or 30 feet and the wind is at around 40 mph. Up we climbed literally hand over hand until we came to what they called the The Gateway. It was where the mountain leveled off some and we got our poles back out. On we hiked as we still could not see very far and didn't have a good concept of how much further it was to the top. About then Time and a Half, a fellow thru hiker, appeared out of the fog and told us we were almost there. It wasn't much longer when you could just make out the silhouette of the Katahdin sign. We stopped and gave each other fist bumps and then moved on up to the sign.
There was one other person at the top which was a shock to me but a pleasant surprise. We began the ritual of taking pictures and even though the fog and strong wind made that more challenging, the fact that we were by ourselves gave us the opportunity for lots more photos than would have otherwise been possible. After pictures we found some boulders to use as wind breaks and had a snack break. McDuck wanted to wait for a bit to see if the sky would clear and we would take some additional pictures. As we waited Joe, Kerry and Felix arrived and did their pictures. JFK reminded me that we needed to do the Thumb Booty dance in honor of Pink  so he broke out in song and we broke out in dance. Soon more and more people began to summit. By the time we decided to head down there were more than 50 people up top and a line had formed for pictures with the sign. I was very glad we had arrived when we did, even though we didn't have clear skies and calm winds.

We headed down and as we did the sky began to clear and we were all taken by surprise at how rugged the terrain and mountain was. We had decided to take the Abol Trail down since it was supposed to be shorter and it might have been shorter but it was definitely steep. A very steep boulder scramble for a significant portion of this trail. More of the hand scramble technical climbing. Eventually that gave way to a more traditional trail and the ladies met us on trail near the bottom. 
We made it back to the house got cleaned up and off to supper. After supper I got myself ready for bed and worked on getting journal entries out.
Today we hiked 5.3 miles, 26,224 steps, low 52° high 77°. Tomorrow I am aiming not to hike anywhere cause I am done! I do plan to put together at least one more journal entry in the next day or two, hoping to kind of wrap up this adventure. So stay tuned.","The Birches

TheOkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668327,"How to wrap up this Appalachian Journal of mine is a bit problematic for me. So, this may just be a compilation of thoughts without much organization. I can hear some of you saying, so how's that different from any of your other entries?
We did it was my first thought when I finally saw the sign through the dense fog that morning. Not that I was surprised that we did it but more a statement of fact and celebration. I was somewhat surprised that I was not emotionally connected to the finish. I have read hundreds of other hikers trail journals and watched lots of YouTube videos and have been more emotional for their summit than my own. 
I was then very thankful to God for the protection He provided us, for the many many ways He made things work out for us, for the strength in our feet and legs to carry us onward each day, for the wonderful people He placed along the trail at just the right moments to feed us, to encourage us, to be a new friend to us, and to give us help when we needed it. I am very thankful to my wife Gorgeous. She supported me every step of this journey. From long before I ever set foot on the trail she did all she could to make this dream of mine a reality. She traveled out to see me each month, she sent me encouraging messages each day and more importantly she prayed for me each day. Gorgeous, without your support this would have never happened. I love you!
Speaking of prayers, for those of you that read my journal and prayed for the three of us thank you very much for those prayers. The many ways God took care of us, I believe, was in response to your prayers for us. For those of you that took time to leave me a message in my guest book, thank you very much. It was very encouraging to hear from you and to know you were enjoying the journal. 
For my two hiking partners, McDuck and JFK, what a journey. You two helped me, encouraged me, pushed me, made me laugh and carried me through to the end. I don't think I would have made it without you. Also, who has ever heard of three friends starting the trail together and finishing together. That says volumes about the kind of men you are. I'm so glad you let me tag along.
And then there were all of the wonderful people we met on trail. It is you that truly make the experience wonderful. I think about many of the young folks that we enjoyed hanging with, and all of the Trail Angels that provided for us in some way. Lots of wonderful memories from our encounters with each of you. There is a phrase that is used on trail by hikers, The Trail Always Provides, and it is because of the people on trail and associated with the trail that keeps that saying alive.
We walked 2198.4 miles over 5,000,000 steps. If you did that on roads it would still be difficult. If you did that on nice trails it would still be difficult. I think that is where I missed how difficult this trail really was, because we had some roads and we had some nice trails but we had lots and lots of very difficult trail. I thought I knew how hard it was going to be however, I soon learned how hard it was. All of that to say the level of difficulty pushed each of us to challenge our own abilities beyond what we thought we could do, and that is one of my favorite takeaways from this journey. 
I hope that in some small way you have been challenged by reading this journal to push yourself beyond what you think you can do. I'm so appreciative and somewhat humbled that you took the time to follow my journey. Now it's time for me to go get some ice cream cause I heard some where that it is the most important meal of the day. The question remains, I wonder where I will wander tomorrow?",,View Entry,"Aug 24, Thu",0
