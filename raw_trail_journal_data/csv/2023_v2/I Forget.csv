Fire Turtle said that my trail name should be Trail Magic after I told her about the incredibly nice people that offered me food (bananas, protein bars, Ritz, even a watermelon that was obviously too heavy to carry) and water at  Woody Gap. There was a very steep climb up to Big Cedar Mountain after Woody. Took a lot out of me, but worth it for the awesome view from the top at around 3,900 feet.

The climb up Blood Mountain was a challenge and the descent was filled with boulders and rocks, which made it very slow going. The view from nearly 4,500 feet was spectacular, though a lot of the distant mountains were, as I was told by a day hiker, obscured by smoke from the Canadian wildfires (all the way to Georgia!). Still an awesome view.
Stayed for the first time at a hostel, which was a great experience. Many of the same people I’ve been hiking with were there. Slept in a room with multiple bunks. No tent to set up and such. Hot meal, hot shower, and good conversation…cool experience. There’s a hostel cat too. I’ll post a pic, along with others from the day. I was given a more official trail name today by my fellow hikers…Trail Magic.

Got picked up by a shuttle that night instead of this morning as I mentioned in my previous post. With needing to go to the outfitter in town, the pack and ship, and to get a few supplies, I decided to stay at a hotel and not be rushed and to get a shower and a couple good meals too. Bought a lighter, smaller pack today, it’s considered an ultralight pack, and offloaded some things that I don’t need. I reduced my total pack weight by 4-5 lbs, which might not sound like a lot but, trust me, it makes a huge difference. Plus the pack I bought is more comfortable overall. I’ll ship the old one to my Brother’s house so I can pick it up when I’m back there after I finish hiking. I’m renergized by my lighter more comfortable pack!

I’m now a member of the Mile High Club, according to Mike, and no not that club, Dad 😄 Much of the rest of the day was spent mostly ridge walking above 4,700, with no deep gaps to drop down into (what goes down, must go up), which was a welcome change of pace. Of course, there was one steep climb before descending down the last couple of miles to Betty’s Creek. 


Met a very cool English guy named Chris, on my way up Standing Indian. He owns a small engine repair business and rental in Franklin, NC. We talked life, also why we hike the AT, for a 1/2 hour. Made a connection and we plan to keep in touch. He’s going through some serious life changing stuff, including divorce and wanting to get out of the business because it’s making him miserable. He thanked me for listening and for my good insight. Funny how life is sometimes, who you randomly meet. He laughed when he learned my last name…Briggs & Stratton small engines he works on a lot 😄Coincidence? They say things happen for a reason. Hmm….who knows? Kindred spirits for sure. 


Also met Mayor, at Standing Indian shelter where I stayed last night.  He walked up with his son as I was having breakfast. Nice older guy with a lot of good info. He completed a thru 7 years ago. 


Helped a guy out who got separated from his wife and kid. There were other access trails at that the top of Standing Indian and she missed a turn. Lucky I had a bar so he could call and get her and their daughter turned around. Karma is a real thing!

Would’ve been an awesome view from the top and from Albert Mountain fire tower ☹️ It was completely socked in. 


Trail magic kicked in again today. Stopped to talk to a day hiking lady and, as we were about to part ways, she handed me one of my very favorite protein bars 😋 Must’ve looked hungry, a constant out on the trail. You burn 4,000-5,000 calories a day and there’s no way you can eat that much every day, let alone carry it!

Nice guy from Missouri. We’ll probably have dinner together tonight. Will likely spend at least a couple of days in town to dry out my gear, do laundry, eat some good meals, and resupply. The forecast is looking awful, so the stay will likely be longer than I’d prefer so I can avoid the bulk of the rain. 
Saw the real Sherpa again today…the third time. Found out today that he and his now wife scaled Mt Everest and had their wedding ceremony up there. How amazing is that?? Where did you get married? 😄
More crazy Trail Magic, and/or Karma. A guy I just met today at the shelter last night bought me an awesome dinner for my birthday tonight. I’m going to return the favor tomorrow because Nick’s birthday was on the 9th. Also, before we went to dinner I put a load of laundry in the hotel washer and it was already paid for, normally $3 a load. All I had to do was hit start. Then when I got back from dinner and put my laundry in the dryer, the dryer was also already paid for too! Crazy!A birthday to remember, for sure! I’ve been meeting such great people.

You could see for as far as 100 miles, or more! It topped the view from Wayah Bald yesterday, which I didn’t think was possible.

I often yell out “hey bear”, or the like, as I’m hiking, to announce my presence. In this case, I hadn’t done it for a bit.

Set up my tent nearby. My Smokies thru hike registration allows me to do that. Anyone with a Back Country Pass, for day/weekend type hikes, must sleep in the shelter, where they make reservations. The Smoky Mountain National Park has some funny regulations, but they’re evidently because it’s the busiest national park. 


Saw many signs of wild pigs, including many areas where they had torn up the ground, mud pits where they wollow, and lots of prints.

I Forget,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666568,"Went 7.8 miles to Davenport Gap, the official end of the Smokies, descending nearly 3,000 feet of elevation in the process. We hiked the approximate 70 miles of the park in 6 days. The total for the day was actually 9 miles because of the 1.2 mile round trip on a side trail to the Cammerer Fire Tower, the only one that I’ve seen with the essentially complete structure where the person stationed there lived and worked. We ate lunch on the rocks near the tower, as it turns out, with three timber rattlers as lunch guests. I noticed one in the shade under a bush several feet away, then two more in spaces between the boulders near where we were sitting. If you don’t mess with them, they don’t mess with you. 


We’re taking a zero day in Newport, TN tomorrow for a much needed food resupply, hot shower, laundry, and steak dinner. After 7 straight days in the woods, a basic thing like a shower is amazing. The AT breaks life down into very simple terms. 


It’s kind of difficult for me to believe, but I’m only about 36 miles from my original goal of 275 miles to Hot Springs, NC. I plan now to continue for a while longer past there. As I close in on Hot Springs, I reflect on my journey thus far. Though very difficult, it’s also been extremely rewarding. The many nice people that I’ve met along the way, the amazing sites and wildlife, and the tough physical and mental challenges met I’m sure all have had a permanent impact on me. Believe me, there were definitely times that I questioned myself, earlier on, like during a 7.5 mile mostly steep climb out of the NOC in the rain, the last hour in the dark, or the back to back long steep mountain climbs in GA, Rocky Mt and Tray Mt, or Blood Mountain, where many thru hikers quit. Also, a very steep, bouldery, hand over hand ascent up Mount Adams in the rain. However, I persevered and each day I’ve felt a little bit stronger, less sore, gained my mountain legs and now I believe that I can handle anything the AT can throw at me. A common AT long hiker saying is “embrace the suck”, meaning embrace the difficult and challenging times because great things are around the bend or up the next mountain. That’s why I see the AT experience as a metaphor for life, difficult at times, but also very beautiful and rewarding if you take the time to soak it in.","Cosby Knob Shelter

I went up and over Big Butt Mountain for the second time in a year. It’s a steep climb, and technical and rocky at times and can be slow going. I also went across Big Firescald Ridge again.

During our second challenging climb, we came across a roaring mountain stream. We spent some time cooling and cleaning off. The water was surprisingly cold, but very refreshing and a welcome relief.

Another example of the AT experience being a metaphor for life. 
This morning, we met a very nice gentleman, Mark, a trail maintenance crew volunteer, at Bald Mountain Shelter. As we were getting ready to hike out this morning, he walked up to do maintenance around the shelter. We had a nice long and enjoyable conversation.

I suggested that his version of RICE should be River, Ibuprofen, Camp, Elevation 😄


It was a hot humid day, that started out with a long climb with heavy resupplied packs, making the early going slow and very tiring. A few miles later we arrived at Jones Falls.

Other than allergies, I had a great time in Marion! The hostel and people there were awesome, as was everyone I met in town. We also got to see Bones again, who we’d met at a shelter just after Damascus. ShowMe and I both like talking to him. Turns out, after hearing one of his stories from when he was hiking in Maine, ShowMe and I gave him a new trail name… Moose Hoof 😄 Bones was a name he gave himself, which isn’t as legitimate as one given by other AT hikers, like with mine and with the one I gave Nick “ShowMe”. 


Bunny, the hostel caretaker, is a great lady, and the owner, Coach, was a cool guy. I enjoyed hanging out talking to them both. I’ve met such great, generous, genuinely nice, friendly and helpful people on this adventure, both on and off trail, that it’s helped restore my faith in humanity. I’d been becoming a little cynical over the last number of years and this has definitely helped with that. I’ve discussed this with several people, along the way, who’ve had a very similar experience. Very cool!

We got to do some more sightseeing today, starting with a circa 1890 farm, which was quite interesting. A little further down the trail was a one room school house, of the same era, and the Settlers Museum. A nice man working there gave us a tour, with lots of farm and household implements and other historical items to see. We also were able to buy some snacks and cold drinks. At the farm, we got to eat some fresh grapes and I shared some with the resident rooster. 


A few more miles down the trail, we reached VA 683 and I-81 at AT mile 546. We got a couple of snack items at the convenience store and ate a late lunch at a Mexican restaurant right along the trail.

The biggest challenge of the hot humid day was that we had no available water sources along the trail. It was the first time on this journey that I had no water sources during a full day of hiking. So, we had to carry more water than usual. We carried about 3/4 of a gallon each, and the extra weight. My pack was probably in the 40 lbs area, several pounds more than usual after a food resupply.
