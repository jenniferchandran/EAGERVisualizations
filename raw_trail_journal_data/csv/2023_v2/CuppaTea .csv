CuppaTea ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660437,"It's time to head back to the trail for Shutterbug's second thru attempt.  We started this attempt in November, 2022, at Springer Mountain.  Our theory was, if we had to train (and we did!!), it might as well be on the trail itself.  So off we went for a week.  The weather was great and we were able to get some miles in.  Then came the holidays and bad eating habits!  Oh dear!  There goes the conditioning.....","

CuppaTea ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660438,"The new year is here and it is time to dedicate myself to some serious training.  The weather in the Georgia mountains is not too cold (as opposed to Wyoming), so we headed back to the Appalachian Trail to walk some more miles.   Night time temps were generally below 32 degrees, which I don't care for.  Staying in a Bed and Breakfast was the answer.  We slackpacked 5 days until the weather warmed up, then headed out for an overnight.  It was great weather, but did get into the 20's that night.  I discovered I have some tweaking to do with my underquilt, as I was cold most of the night.  Humph!","

CuppaTea ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660439,"There is total chaos in this house as we begin to assemble, organize and pack our gear for our departure Tuesday, March 7th.
The plan is to return to our favorite Bed and Breakfast, Your Home In the Woods.  Our neighbors will drive us there and stay overnight so they can experience a little of what hikers go through. On Wednesday, March 10th, we will be shuttled to Indian Gap trailhead, GA, to pick up where we left off in February.  My pack weighs in at 21 lbs with water, no food.  I'm pretty happy with that. Winter gear weighs more (warmer socks, gloves, hats, hand warmers, etc).  When we hit warmer night time temps, I'll be able to switch out some things and the pack will weigh even less.  Although by that time hiker hunger has set in, resulting in carrying more food.  It's never easy!!!  Overall weight with 4-5 days of food and water:  26 lbs.","

CuppaTea ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660591,"After a delicious breakfast at the BnB,. Paul shuttled us up to Indian Grave trailhead, where we left off in February. It was perfect hiking weather 60 degrees with slight breeze. After the required photos, we headed uphill. Today's climb was a tough one, Tray Mountain. The steepness was thankfully offset by a number of switchbacks. Nonetheless, there were rocks to scramble over and steep rock steps to descend. As we approached Tray Gap, I heard voices and saw what appeared to be a large white tent. The odor of bacon wafted towards us and we hastened our steps. The owner of Boots Off Hostel, in Tennessee, was here giving out trail magic 🪄!
Trail magic: coming across person or persons in places along the trail, usually road crossings or trailheads, who are cooking or otherwise supplying hikers with all sorts of food, drinks, and offers of assistance. You never know where this will happen, or what is being offered, so it is magical when you come across it!
Shutterbug and I sat down for a few minutes, chatting with other hikers while enjoying a fruit cup and a tangerine (both of which are deemed far too heavy to carry in one's backpack!!!) When we left, bags of chips were handed to us. Chips don't weigh very much so we were happy to oblige!!
We made good time getting to Tray Mountain shelter but it was still too early to stop for lunch, so onward we pressed
About 1:30 pm, I came up on a good resting spot. There was a decent sized log, just about the right height to sit on and have lunch. The height is a key factor, because if it is too low, it is waaay to hard to stand back up!!! We enjoyed a nice pack off, boots off break for 30 minutes. Our meager lunches were augmented with fresh baked cookies from the BnB as well as the  chips from the trail magic.
Lots of hikers were on the trail today. They come from all over. We met Brits and Bavarians and the states were well represented as well. Tumbleweed from Missouri stopped to chat while I was waiting for Shutterbug. She is in the foreground in the picture above.
Today was not going well for Shutterbug. The climbs were tough and aggravated the sciatic pain she has been fighting for awhile. Added to that was some intestinal distress.  A decision had to be made.She needed to get off the trail. 
We discussed the possibility of continuing forward as planned, but it was too many miles. The sensible plan was to turn around,hike back to Steeltrap Gap and camp there, as there was a water source. Then in the morning we would continue backtracking. The nearest road crossing was Tray Gap, but the road is so awful only two shuttle drivers will attempt it. Shutterbug called one, he was busy and couldn't come. We got lucky on the second try and she arranged with Michelle to come get us tomorrow. 
By 3:30 pm we were back at Steeltrap, dropping our packs. Shutterbug started scoping out suitable trees for hanging our hammocks, while I took our water bags down to the spring. It was a nice trail, but down, down and down some more! Coming back up was even more challenging carrying the wet, slippery, icy cold bags. I dropped mine, and didn't it roll and slide partly back down! Son of a biscuit! Patience CuppaTea! 
Camp chores were done, hammocks set up, water boiled for dinners to hydrate while the sun was setting.
7 PM arrives and CuppaTea and Shutterbug have disappeared into hammocks. A beautiful day ends on a disappointing note. ☹️","Indian Grave Gap
