Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665103,"It’s been a year and a half since I came off trail on top of Mount Washington after hiking 833 miles of the AT.  It was an incredible experience for me.   I met some awesome people,  made lifelong friends (see picture of some of us - left to right - Barefoot Curt,  MASH, and me) on the Centennial Trail in South Dakota) and learned that although I’d always dreamed of a thru hike of the AT, I found that I wasn’t willing to continue hiking once it got to be a daily grind.  Long section hikes (LASH = Long Ass Section Hike) seem to be a better alternative for me.  Hike your own hike!   I’m super excited to get back out for an as yet to be defined length of time.   My initial goal is to complete Virginia but I have a hard stop at 2 months so I might keep heading south from the Virginia border.  I’m excited that some, maybe all, of the folks I hiked with in 2021 are planning to join this adventure.   We’re all a bit older but hopefully a little better prepared this time around.   Stay tuned!

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665394,"Here it is only about 7 weeks before I start section 2 of my AT hike.  Miles (from our 2021 two month hike) and I figured we could use a few days on the trail to dial in our gear so we’re going to hike north from Caledonia State park in Pennsylvania hopefully to the town of Boiling Springs,  PA.  It’s about 40 miles in about 2 ½ days so maybe a bit aggressive for a shakedown but we’re both in pretty good shape.   This will give me a chance to test my gear as well as my physical capabilities on the trail. 
My base weight (everything except worn clothing,  food and water) is about 14.25 pounds.  With food and a liter and a half of water I’m carrying about 25 pounds.   I’m bringing some extra food to better simulate a 4 day carry which I found was more typical for us last time.  Given that I lost 25 pounds in 2 months last time I probably need to eat more on trail.   One big weight concession I’ve made this time is for a camp chair.  I found that the many hours spent sitting on the ground really caused me back pain.   This shakedown trip hopefully will help me decide if the 1 pound Helinox chair is worth the weight & silly cost.   My gear is as follows (all weights shown in ounces):Zpacks Arc Haul backpack 22.1 oz  Two Side pockets 1.2 ozZpacks Duplex tent 18.5 oz8 tent Stakes & bag (0.39 oz each) 3.2 ozTherm-a-Rest NeoAir XLite NXT Sleeping Pad (regular wide) 16 oz40 degree down Sleeping bag , stuff sack 27.2 ozPillow 3.88 ozDyneema bags – 2 2.65 ozBear bag (Ursack major xl) 8.8 oz  Opsak odor proof bag for storing food 0.8 oz Jetboil Minimo stove,  pot, fuel, lighter - 24 ozSpoon 0.5 ozCnoc water bladder- 2 liter   2.6 ozSawyer squeeze water filter 3.1 oz1 liter Water bottle 1.13 ozCamp chair (Helinox chair zero) 16 ozClothes - including those I’m wearing (long and short sleeve wool shirts, shorts, convertible long pants,  2 pr wool socks,  1 pr silk socks, 1 pr underwear, hat) 44.3 ozSubtract Worn clothes – worn clothes don’t count against your base weight(short sleeve wool shirt, shorts,  1 pr wool socks, hat)   -18.37 oz

Today we hiked 16 miles from Caledonia State park to the Tom’s Run shelter in Pine Grove Furnace State park. My wonderful wife Sue drove us there and we got on trail by 9 am. There was surprisingly few people on the trail with us so we’re not sure where the bubble of thru hikers is. We saw less than 10 hikers either direction (so far). Who knows who will show up here tonight but as of 5:30 pm we have the place to ourselves. We did have the good fortune of running into a couple of guys doing trail magic right around lunch time. Fresh fruit, Gatorade, hot dogs…Yum! It was a great day weather wise but tomorrow is supposed to be rainy with possible storms. Oh joy!

After a hot dinner of Ramen noodles and SPAM, tortillas and peanut butter, string cheese and a Clif bar I feel like I’m ready to go again. I think both Jeff (“Miles”) and I are ready to give our knees and ankles a break for a while. The rocks on the trail are not what we’re used to on our training hikes at home. Hopefully another 15 or so miles tomorrow. We’ll see. 

After dinner a hiker with the trail name ""Two pack"" came into camp.  He has 2 full packs.  One on his back and one on his front.   He had a lot of gear, too much by our standards.   He had started in Harpers Ferry a week ago so he's going slow but he plans on continuing north.   Hopefully he sheds some gear and a pack along the way.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665486,"The 2nd day of our shakedown hike has been mixed.  It started drizzling last night at 9 pm and rained off and on all night and until around noon today.   We finally gave up on the rain gear and just got wet from the rain instead of the sweat.  We were up before 6, packed up and ate 1st breakfast.   I had 2 packages of instant grits,  coffee, and a Clif bar.   Then we hiked nearly 4 miles to the Pine Grove Furnace State park general store and got breakfast sandwiches for 2nd breakfast.  I got 2 so I could have one for lunch.   After that we hiked about over 7 miles to the James Fry shelter where we rested and ate lunch.  The sun was starting to come out and the wind was helping us dry some of our gear.  We saw one hiker this morning going southbound and nobody passed us going north.   It was odd because later in the day we had the same hiker pass us again going south.   He apparently is doing little section hikes to complete pieces of the trail. We hiked the last few miles of our 15 total today in mixed sun and drizzle and are camping in a tent site just north of route 94 in Pennsylvania.   I hate camping and hearing traffic noise.  It’s supposed to be nice tonight but I’m writing this in my tent as it rains.   It feels good to get off my feet and wait a while for dinner.  We’ll probably be in bed by 8 tonight.   While the wind was blowing a bit ago we watched and heard a huge tree come down a hundred yards away.   Glad we weren’t closer.   Dinner tonight is instant potatoes with some kind of packaged meat.  Maybe Buffalo chicken.   A couple of cheese sticks and probably a Clif bar.   The bars give you an easy extra 250 calories which I need while I’m hiking.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665535,"Last night was chilly. We both wore our long sleeve shirts and puffy jackets. It stayed breezy but the rain stopped around 5 pm. We got up sometime after 6 am and had an easy packup. I was glad to have warm cheesy grits and hot coffee for breakfast. Our last day of hiking was a short one. We only had 8 miles to get into Boiling Springs, PA.   With a 7:30 start we made it into town by just after 11 even with a decent break at the Alec Kennedy shelter. A nice weather day for our last day. We hit a pizza joint in town before Jeff’s wife Marcia (trail name “Girl Friday”) came to pick up our stinky selves. Off to a shower and a soft bed!

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667001,"(Todays post is longer than I'll normally do because I have time.  Forgive me for future posts that are short but I'm sure it's because I'm crazy tired.)
Well we’re off!   Today we start our second major section hike of the Appalachian Trail (AT).   We had hoped for a complete reunion of all four of us from our last hike: Me (trailname Boneless Thighs), Jeff (trailname Miles),  Curt (trailname Barefoot Curt) and Dave (trailname MASH) but Dave is still working through some post-surgery physical therapy and decided to pass for now.   We miss him but the three of us are starting in Harpers Ferry, WV and heading south into the Appalachian mountains.    My personal goal is to complete Virginia but I may have time to continue if it’s still fun.    We’ll see.   We’re all glad that we’re not (hopefully) dealing with flooding like the Northeast has been experiencing over the last month or so.  As I mentioned in my 2021 Trail Journal, sometimes the AT literally follows the middle of small streams or crosses streambeds.  These streams fill up during heavy rains.   I’ve seen pictures of folks hiking on the trail with water up to their thighs.   No fun and possibly dangerous.
In a couple of days we’ll be passing Front Royal, VA and then into the Skyline Drive area.   Hopefully over the next couple of weeks we’ll get our trail legs back and the daily elevation changes won’t be so hard.   Will Curt continue his humorous privy rankings?   Will our food get eaten by bears?  Stay tuned!My wife Sue drove us out to Harpers Ferry – Thanks!  I love you and I’ll miss you.  
Jeff’s wife Marcia (""Girl Friday"") and son Zach drove him out and hiked with us a bit to see him off.  
We started at about 9:30 am.   The weather was not horribly hot but it was still humid.   This is going to be a sweaty hike with frequent thunderstorms I suspect.  The AT tends to be perpetually damp but the mountains here have been especially rainy recently.  After saying our farewells we crossed the beautiful Shenandoah river and headed upstream.  Only 4 miles of the AT are in West Virginia.  It’s the least in any state.   They say that you need to sing “Take Me Home, Country Roads” by John Denver (“Almost Heaven, West Virginia….) the entire time you are hiking in the state.   I tried.  I don't remember the words as well as Cheeseburger in Paradise.  Then we hit Virginia.   It has about 550 miles which is the most in any one state.   It could take a while.
We stopped for lunch at a crossroad and I watched the gear (and enjoyed my new chair!) while the guys went to a local market and got green apple Gatorade.   My new favorite flavor. 
We're camping near the Blackburn Trail center after a short 11.5 mile day.   I'm hoping that we can ramp up to a daily average mileage in the high teens.   So much depends on weather. 
We just beat some rain into the center and were greeted by one of the caretakers, Amelia, who gave us lemonade and a chocolate bar.  A solar shower, bunkhouse and screen porch made this a Shangri-la stop for us.  
People ask me all the time:  ""Why are you doing this?"" or they say ""That's going to be so much fun!"".   We all want to respond ""Who the hell knows"" and ""Sometimes yes, sometimes no"".  We all love being on the trail.   The solitude and camaraderie, sights and experiences that you can't have any other way and the look on people's faces when you tell them that you are going on a two month hike.   Life on the trail can be awesome but miserable too.  Aches and pains, wet feet for days on end and a severe lack of calories at times.  In 2021 I stayed so wet for an extended period of time that I basically got diaper rash.   I'm carrying a tube of Desitin this time.   I wouldn't trade this experience for anything.   My philosophy is ""He who dies with the most stories wins"" and I guarantee we'll come off the trail with a few doozies.  They might not be repeatable though...
Jeff says ""It's simple.   You stop moving you die.""
Curt says that he does it for the chocolate!

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667698,"Today started very foggy but finished up beautiful. We were all alone in our bunkhouse last night and it was great. We had a leisurely breakfast and were packed up and hiking by 8 am. The hike out was straight uphill. Not optimal but we did it. In the fog we saw a flock of turkeys and a couple of large bucks with 8 point racks.  
We had a couple of nice overlooks and once the sun came out they were great.
We hit the roller coaster today. Ouch! It’s about 14 miles with a bunch of serious ups and downs. Many of them are very rocky. Once we get our trail legs it might not be bad but we’re still a little soft. We only did 11 miles but we’re beat.
The bees must like (or hate) me. Yesterday I got stung once and today I hit 3 separate nests for 3 more stings. It makes me hike faster just so I get past the bees before they know what’s going on.
We saw a lot of day hikers today and a couple of through hikers. It’s a little late for through hikers going north but these guys looked fast.
Lunch today was a little hike off trail to the Horseshoe Curve restaurant in Bluemont, Virginia. A beer and a sandwich with onion rings and I was good to go. I got one to go for dinner. No Ramen tonight!
Water is scarce down here right now and we spent quite a while trying to get water from the trickle near the Sam Moore shelter where we’re staying. It’s maybe 2 inches deep max.
Tonight is a tent night so fingers crossed for no rain.
Curt has a tweaked knee (not the technical term) and it’s giving him some trouble but hopefully it’ll work itself out.  
So Curt’s privy rankings are starting and the Blackburn center privy ranks 3 Butt Nuggets. I think it got extra credit because it was painted white, had TP and hand sanitizer.
I’m loving my new chair tonight!
After today I think we’re all wondering why we are out here. Just kidding. The hard days lead to easier ones.

Today was a hard day.  We did 15.4 miles and the first 6 of it was the roller coaster.  Lots of ups and downs.   I’ve started including the daily ascent and descent numbers.   Hopefully I’ll remember each day. 
Jeff (trail name correction “Miles 2.0"") is the only one that doesn’t have a blister and some chafing in a painful spot.  Hiking in this area in August is humid even though it hasn’t been too hot.  We sweat a ton.
Not sure what our plan is for tomorrow because we have to be able to handle these issues or hiking will be slow. One option is the Mountain Home bed and breakfast near Front Royal, VA.   Nothing fancy but shower and breakfast included.   Close to the trail so that is nice.
We continue to hike to the same destination as the trail ridge runner (sort of like a maintainer who hikes a ton) “K2"".  This is our 3rd night with him.
Nobody got stung today even though we saw lots of bees and nests.  Right now we could probably use a shower and a day off to heal.  Normally we bathe in  streams but they barely have enough water for drinking.   The salty sweat is causing the chafing to be worse.  
Weather was beautiful though even though we’re hurting.   1.5 miles an hour on the roller coaster but maybe 2.5 after.  Pretty good.
Sorry for the somewhat disjointed writeup.   I’m writing this over a period of a few hours while doing what needs to be done.   Get and filter water (requires a walk downhill), set up tent and extract gear from my pack, blow up sleeping pad, cook and eat dinner, get more water, check and care for feet, sleep (and hope you smell bad enough to discourage critters from visiting).

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667777,"Ascent :   3077 feetDescent  : 3474 feetToday was a relatively easy 14.9 miles. That doesn’t mean that we’re not sore and blistered. Once again the weather was clear and not horribly hot.  The humidity was another story.  The trail today was a piece of cake compared to the other days so far.  Long flattish sections where we could really move.   We made it to lunch before we decided that we all needed to get clean and do a small resupply.   On the trail you have to look at your food supply and other options ahead and determine how much more you need to get you through.   “Other options” mean pretty much any place that has food that you didn’t have to carry.   Gas station, restaurant,  etc.   We’re relying on the waysides along the Skyline Drive in the Shenandoah NP to provide us with a sandwich or something similar and minor resupply (gas canister, Ramen noodles,  instant potatoes or whatever else is light and highly caloric).  Along this section we really shouldn’t have to carry more than 2 days of food.   That makes our packs lighter which is a big deal with the elevations that we’re doing.   I added some pictures today of our packs so you can see packing styles.   Curt and Jeff are very neat with not much on the outside.   My pack, however,  looks messy but I know where it all is.  Things I need quick are on the outside. We got water from a spring at a shelter today and found someone had left a ton of stuff from what appeared to be a weekend party.   Steak,  eggs, red peppers, stoves, gas canisters, and all sorts of other crazy stuff that was all marked “Free"".  We grabbed some stuff because it was free!Later we saw a tree with a formation on it that looked like a rhino.   Apparently someone else thought so too because it has a nice sign “Ray’s rhino"".   See it in my photos. After much deliberation we decided at lunchtime that we needed a shower and some small resupply before hitting the Skyline Drive section of the Shenandoah NP.   We chose to stay at Mountain Home B&B since it was right on the trail and on $35.  Shower,  $5 laundry for all of us and a spectacular breakfast in the morning.   They also shuttled us around for dinner and resupply in town.   The trail doesn’t have to be hard all the time!  Awesome place built in 1847.  In Front Royal we had big burgers and shopped at Martin’s with the lights out.  Power was out but they let us shop for non-refrigerated items. Perfect for us but pretty hard to see when it’s mostly dark.  We’ll be back on the trail tomorrow and hopefully we’ll miss most of the rain that is supposed to come through.   Tomorrow we’ll have to get backcountry permits when we enter the park.  Hopefully the bears there are on vacation.   They used to have lots but supposedly a bad round of mange went through the population and there are fewer now.  We’ll see. I’m on the B&B wifi tonight because there is no Verizon service so who knows about the park.  If my posts are delayed that is likely the reason.

Cell service tonight is bad so I will not be able to load any pictures or video.

Today started great at the B&B. The breakfast was unbelievable. Last night we had to place our order and choose between scrambled eggs with a ton of things in them, pancakes with or without various fresh fruit from the farm up the street, French toast, and several other items that I can’t remember. Fresh fruit, juice, coffee, etc. This isn’t normal hiking fare. It was a great but short break. 

A bit after 9 we were back on the trail. Immediately we saw a raccoon racing us up the hill. And what a hill it was. It seemed to go on forever. Once we finished it I literally took my shirt off and wrung it out. So it was a wet day. We knew that the forecast was for bad storms this afternoon so our goal was the Gravel Springs shelter where we knew we’d get water. It was only 13.5 miles but with our late start that was fine. We made great time and arrived before the storm. We set up in the designated tent spots, got water and cooked an early dinner. The storm hit fast and I think Jeff and Curt got back to their tents in time but I couldn’t get the Bear box open for my food so I got soaked. A good bath I guess. Then back at my tent it became apparent that their designated sites have bad drainage. Too late now! So my tent bottom feels like a waterbed. I’m hoping not much comes in. The thunderstorms have been going for an hour now. Tomorrow’s weather is supposed to be better so maybe I can dry out a bit.

We made it into the Skyline Drive area of the Shenandoah NP finally today. We’ve crossed it a couple of times and can hear it sometimes. We noticed a number of apples on the trail. This area had a lot of homesteads before the parks existence and their apple trees are still living as part of the forest. Much of our time was spent in thick brush that made it feel like a green sauna. Then we started climbing higher on Mount Marshall and the temperatures began to drop. Pretty soon we were at about 3400 feet and in the clouds. It felt good but made us feel like storms were coming sooner than later. Nothing like lightning on top of a mountain to motivate you. 

Yesterday we went past a very long section of new, high fencing with barbed wire and government signs warning you to stay out. My theory was an alien landing site but our host last night told us it was for trying to bring preserve and bring back nearly extinct species. Neat. Some sounded dangerous like big cats so we spent today looking over our shoulders. We’ve all seen Jurassic Park. Those critters will find a way out. 

At some point today we hit a crossroad and we couldn’t tell which was our trail. Jeff jokingly stated that “When in doubt, the trail goes uphill “. Sure enough, sadly he was right. 

Good grief. It’s still raining and thundering after over 4 hours. I’m not too wet but things are not pleasant. SAnd once again, why do we do this? One reason is that it sort of resets things a bit in your brain. We all take for granted things like a shower (hot OR cold), water from a faucet that you can drink without filtering, grabbing food from the fridge, a dry bed!!! Makes me wonder how Lewis and Clark did it. And they built boats along the way. Amazing. (I might need one soon actually. )

Not sure who is reading this but if anyone is interested in reading my old journal entries for our 2021 hike from Harpers Ferry, WV to Mount Washington, NH I'll post a link when I get better coverage

It was a big climb but we figured that today was cool so let’s just do it.    Oh my.   It was up up up to Mary’s rock.  The view was beautiful.   Then another 1.3 miles to our shelter.   We were exhausted.   Then we found that the water was 0.3 miles downhill. Good water it was too.Nothing super exciting about today except for the weather and our miles.   Gonna sleep well tonight.

Another great hiking day. We did 14.5 miles into the Big Meadows campground. I was there by 1:30 and was able to reserve us a campsite. We could have gone further but we wanted showers and Curt and I need to manage some blisters. Last night was cool and good sleeping weather but the tent sites were on a slope so not great. Sometime after 2:30 am I heard what I’m pretty sure was a bear growling and huffing through our area. I’m sure it smelled our socks and shoes and took off. 

The hike was easier than other days with less ups and downs and some smooth trails. We’re in the park so I attribute that to the need for a more tourist friendly hiking environment. We got some beautiful views throughout the day at places like the Pinnacle, Stony Man overlook and Crescent Rock overlook. It was clear with a little smoky haze. I’m assuming still the Canadian fires. Or maybe a hazy stench from us?

Around 10:30 we arrived at the Skyland lodge for a break and a quick bite to eat. Hiker hunger is kicking in for me and, given the opportunity, I eat several times more than normal during the day. It’s a hard habit to break once you’re off trail but necessary here to keep from wasting away. If I haven’t said it before, we like this section of the trail partly because of the views but also because of the waysides which allow us to eat food that we didn’t have to carry. I carry 2.5 pounds of food per day and that isn’t nearly enough to get me the calories I need out here.

We finished our day with showers, laundry and walked a short distance to the Big Meadows lodge where they had a Taproom for beers and dinner and comfy chairs! We hung out for a while because the bugs in our campsite are bad and we actually have cell coverage here so I can do this journal entry.

Storms are likely coming tomorrow so we’re figuring we’ll hike to the Lewis Mountain campground 8.7 miles ahead and reevaluate the situation. Wet boots are not good for healing the foot issues Curt and I have. Jeff’s feet are doing great so far. I’m going to have Sue bring me my old hiking shoes from my 2021 hike. 

It's always an adventure!

A short day today but we’re over 100 miles now. We’ve only gone 8.7 miles but we stayed dry.   Right after we set up our tents the rain started and while it’s not been hard, it’s been steady.  The temps are dropping too.  We’re in the mid 60s at 3 pm.
Hiking was very easy with minimal elevation changes.   Curt and I really hoped to keep our feet dry to allow for more healing.  Plus we’d been through the storms the other night and didn’t want a repeat.   T’storms are forecasted but haven’t materialized yet.  It’s just getting colder and foggier.  
We are tenting at the Lewis Mountain campground and hanging out under the roof at the camp store.    The power went out so they could only sell us stuff that they knew the price for and would only take cash.  At least we’re dry.We’re hoping to have a big day tomorrow miles wise.   TBD.

Only saw 1 hiker all day today.
It was breezy and chilly this morning. The temp was 59 but the breeze was blowing strong. Since we had a longer hike today we got started early. The campground power still was off from whatever issues they had yesterday so you needed a flashlight to use the bathroom. I’m glad we stayed there to avoid the rain but we now need to make up some miles. The weather was good so we decided to head for the Pinefield shelter. That basically gave us our first 20 mile day. We all felt pretty good but with sore feet. Most of my foot issues are getting better but I did find a new blister on my right little toe. Hopefully not a long term problem.

We saw a number of deer and what I think was a skunk. It might have been a cat but it would have been an odd place for a cat. We saw bear and bobcat scat too. 

I was out front all of today and got real tired of the spiderwebs. I felt like I could do what Shrek did in the movie and wave my trekking poles and get a big ball of spiderwebs like a ball of cotton candy. Maybe I could knit a new pair of silk socks. Large distances of the hike had very narrow trail with encroaching vegetation. This got our boots wet with the potential of ticks. I also kept hitting stinging nettles. If you brush one of these things it can feel worse than a bee sting. Which by the way Curt and I had one each of today as well. I’m ready to be done with the bees. When the sting startles you, you start dancing around and you’re liable to sprain your ankle. 

Water continues to be something we have to plan for more than I anticipated. Twice today we walked a quarter mile or so to a ranger station to get water since many of the normal water sources are dry. It was warm enough to make us REALLY sweat on the uphills but the next 2 days are supposed to be worse. Weather is supposed to be good tonight so I didn’t even consider staying in the shelter due to the reports of mice. Even if you don’t have mice running over you at night you still run the risk of breathing in mouse feces dust. I’ll do it to avoid bad weather or if the shelter is pretty nice. None of the shelters here are what I would call nice. Passable at best. Curt gave the privy a 2 out of 5. Not great. 

There is supposed bear activity in the area so hopefully we are all fine. Probably good that I can’t post this until tomorrow. 

We’re going to stop after a few miles to get a light resupply at the Loft Mountain camp store. Then we’ll hike on to the Blackrock shelter. It’s only 13.2 miles total but it will set us up to get into Waynesboro the next day where we’ll take a true zero day. A zero is no hiking as opposed to a Nero which means that you hiked some to get to the place you’re staying.

We had lots of animals around us last night. I’m pretty sure that there was a bear close to me ripping open logs looking for dinner. The coyotes and owls were vocal as well. Best night sleep I’ve had on the trail. No kidding. 

We have a shorter day today so we decided to head to the Loft Mountain wayside a little off trail in order to get a blackberry milkshake (our last chance) and a big burger. This is my new favorite milkshake. It was worth the extra distance. Folks sometimes wonder how this relates to hiking the AT. This is easy. “The hike” is an experience that consists of not only hiking but enjoying whatever comes your way. 

We then hiked by the camp store where we grabbed a quick one day resupply that should get us to our day off and a full resupply.

The short 13.3 mile hike sets us up for a 20ish mile day tomorrow and then a ride into Waynesboro, Virginia to Stanimal's hostel. Stanimal is a previous through hiker who decided to set up a couple of hiker hostels in Waynesboro and Glasgow, Virginia and his places have become legendary. The plan is to take a true Zero day. All of Monday off to rest, resupply and clean up. I’ve said it before but if you are not careful out here you’re going to have skin issues. Clean and dry is something we are not…ever. 

We took a couple of breaks in order to let feet dry and have snacks. All of us have fallen in love with cheese sticks out here. For some reason it’s better when you’re hiking. Probably the salt. 

Speaking of salt, keeping hydrated with electrolytes is very important. We all have our favorites but I’m just using the Wal-Mart Great Value stuff because it’s tasty and cheap.

Usually camp isn’t a great place to spend a lot of time but today’s shelter isn’t bad. I wouldn’t sleep in it but hanging out here is nice. Water is running well and it’s COLD so I soaked my feet for a bit. Made the water taste funny but oh well. Just kidding. The water is coming from a spring and we get it right from the pipe. That isn’t usually the case but we’ll take this luxury when we can get it.

The tent sites are awful here. Once again we’re sort of forced to use the designated tent spots but they are too small and pure dirt and gravel. We’re getting a cool breeze so that feels good.

A big 20.8 miles today to the Rockfish Gap intersection with route 64. The day started comfortable and the trail was smooth. As we progressed the climbs got harder and we got sweatier because the temperatures kept going up. By the end of the hike we were at 94 degrees. Plus this was a section with minimal water. I met a couple backpacking who had 10 more miles to go and were out of water. I gave them my spare liter. Hopefully they got out with that. Somewhere in the middle of the day we hiked a little off trail and filled up at our only water of the day. 
After getting water and a standup lunch I felt good and started really moving. At some point I remember catching my toe on a rock. It happens a hundred times a day to all of us. This time I went down like a ton of bricks. I didn’t put my hands out to catch myself or anything. I hit the ground and rolled backpack and all. Then I realized that I was laying in poison ivy. Not good. The guys came up before long and checked on me. As far as I know I’m fine but I used Jeff's soap to clean up at the next puddle. Then I got a good shower several hours later at Stanimal’s. My pack probably has poison ivy on it. I hope not but I’m allergic so I’ll know soon enough. 

The last 4 miles of our hike were horrible. The trail designers forgot about switchbacks and just went straight uphill. All other sections were as rocky as northern Pennsylvania. It was a dangerous section so late in our day. We made it though and caught a shuttle from Rockfish Gap into Stanimal’s hostel in Waynesboro. This is a classic and legendary hostel. Bunk rooms, laundry, all in an old house close to most of the shopping and restaurants we need. More tomorrow about Stanimal’s. 

Our dinner was awesome Mexican at La Sabrosita's.  Just a hole in the wall local hangout but great,  and I suspect authentic, food.

We zeroed at Stanimal’s hostel today and it was needed. We did actually walk to Hardee’s for breakfast and a planning session for the next few days. Then we walked to Walmart twice. Once for resupply items and then later for lunch (salad and fruit). I usually crave salad, fruit and vegetables on my days off the trail. I guess that's your body telling you what it needs.  
I was able to call all of my family and quickly catch up and say hi.  It was great to hear their voices.   I miss them out here.
 All day I’ve been anticipating Sue and her mom coming down for a quick visit. They’re combining it with a scenic drive north on the Skyline Drive tomorrow. I hope that the weather is good for them. Besides bringing the shoes I wore on my 2021 hike (I’m hoping they cause fewer blisters) and some other incidentals she brought us all a beautiful peach crisp. We ate a bunch of it in the parking lot where we met them and brought the rest back to Stanimal’s for breakfast. What a magical way to start our hiking day. Thanks honey!

Then we all went back to their hotel where we hung out in the lobby and talked and drank hotel coffee. Dinner was down the street at a hiker favorite Golden Corral! Endless food of all varieties. A great place to eat if you have that hiker hunger. Several plates later we were wondering what it was going to be like carrying all of that up a few thousand feet tomorrow. Yikes. 

South of Rockfish Gap we still appear to have water issues so we’re going to do a shorter than desired day of 17ish miles and camp in a stealth site just so we don’t have to carry water a long way. 2.2 lbs per liter and we’re drinking a lot out here. (Sorry I’m mixing my English and metric measurements.) Our next goal is the Stanimal’s in Glasgow, Virginia about 80 miles south. Ideally we would make it in 4 days but 5 is okay too. 4 would allow us a real zero day and 5 would mean we would only take a partial day off (a Nero). The push is so that maybe we can get Curt to the Virginia triple crown before he has to leave. The triple crown consists of Dragons Tooth, McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs. 

Hike on!

We passed on these and held out for the couple of flowing streams.   This meant carrying water for longer.   Not good.   The shelter we were planning to hike to has very minimal water so we carried some for the last 4.5 miles.   That was rough.  Tomorrow we hike over a mountain called The Priest.  Probably has something to do with having to give us last rites after we summit.   Let’s hope not.It's late and we just finished dinner.  I have to check my feet before bed so I’m going to cut this a little short.  My new old shoes that Sue brought me were great today but I’m afraid that they will fall apart before I finish.   Curt gives the privy here a 4.   That’s amazing. Videos are at https:/youtube.com/channel/UC

Today we hiked 13.7 miles and it might have been the hardest hike of my life.   First we had bees.  All 3 of us got stung by 2 different nests on the trail.   The yellow jackets are bad this time of year.   We each have our own little dance and comments when we get stung.   Mine cannot be included here.
The downhills were a combination of smooth trails and overgrown, steep, rocky trail that was simply treacherous.   Plus we were looking out for bees and snakes.   Someone at last night’s shelter had seen a rattlesnake eating a chipmunk on this section of trail yesterday.   We descended thousands of feet and were greeted by the beautiful Tye River.   The footbridge over the river was a cool “swinging “ bridge.   We rested and ate lunch and washed up a little in preparation for the crazy climb coming up.    I commented that if I got my soap out that I could clean up.   Jeff’s accurate retort was “you don’t have enough soap"".  
The day ended with 3425 feet up over about 4.5 miles.   It seemed never-ending.   Honestly we did great.   I think we had it in us to go further but the next water source was a bit too far.  Once we summited The Priest we took a well deserved break and dried out some.  Plus we had cell service so could text and make some calls.  Sue spent time today ordering me new shoes.   My old “new"" shoes are not going to survive long out here.   The rocks are destroying what’s left so my replacements are being sent ahead to Stanimal’s in Glasgow,  Virginia.   Thanks Sue!
We’re at the Priest shelter.   Good water here but the privy is closed due to being full.

Later in the day yesterday we had 3 hikers come in who had hiked 30 miles. Up the same elevation that had wiped us out in about 14 miles. Dad (“Sweeps""), daughter Marmalade (age 10) and son Patches (8). They are from Ireland and are hiking south from Maine to Georgia. Their goal is 100 days. Dad hiked it before with his older kids when they were this age. They have had many other cool adventures too like driving from Key West to Alaska and backpacking in all of the National parks in the lower 48. Nice family. They had spent a number of years in Baltimore so we talked some about that.

Today we did 22.4 miles over a very long day. Everything started out great. Good trail, nice weather. Then we ran into another backpacker going north with a dog. He indicated that it wasn’t his and that it’d been following him for about 10 miles. It is apparently a hunting dog because it is wearing multiple tracking devices with antenna. The frustrating thing is that it has no ID on its collar. It decided that we were somehow preferable to the other guy and now has followed us for a long way. It’s pretty skinny and we think it’s been out here a while. We spent quite a bit of time trying to find a way to get someone to take it but got nowhere. Part of the problem is getting a decent cell signal and where we cross roads. Many things were tried like SPCA, Animal control, vets and police. Nothing. So in camp tonight we have this dog. And a 20 mile hike into Glasgow tomorrow. Not sure how this is going to work. I will admit that I would have rather left the dog. Who knows whether we are leading it the right way or not. More on this later.

We are camping at the Browntown shelter by a small stream.   It's a nice sound to sleep to but super humid.

22.9 miles today. It was pretty hot but once again the higher elevations were cooler and had a nice breeze. We started in a deep valley with a stream and flat trail but the problem with being near a creek like that is you probably have to go up soon. We did. Lots of climbing. Our faithful dog slept outside our tents last night and ate some of our food for breakfast. We hoped to find a way to get this dog to someone responsible who ISN’T HIKING THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL! Dog hadn’t yet made a single sound. We hiked for a while and all of a sudden dog started yelping and tearing off through the woods. This confirmed my suspicion that dog was a bear hunting dog and he was on the trail of a bear. Curt was convinced that dog had saved our lives. I was concerned that dog was just going to tick off a bear and then lead it back to us. Dog had forgotten that she normally hunts in packs and not by herself. Anyway, when we stopped for lunch at a gravel road intersection Jeff tried calling 911 because that’s what the police office told him to do. While he was on the 911 call a truck drove up. Only car we had seen so far. The truck had hunting dogs in it. We flagged him down and explained the situation. They hopped out, looked at the dog and said “maybe this is one of Pete's dogs"". Apparently Pete had lost 3 dogs. I’m glad we didn’t have 3 dogs following us.  We would have run out of food.  They took dog and that was that. What luck!

At one road crossing we met a couple from Spain (Barcelona) that was traveling here for a few weeks in an RV. They were impressed by our hike on the AT and wanted pictures with us. We’re celebrities! 

I was hiking in front for a while and stopped to let Curt and Jeff catch up but they took longer than I expected. Turns out that after I passed, a big rattlesnake crossed the trail and the guys couldn’t pass until he was sufficiently off trail. We’ve seen a number of snakes but just this one poisonous snake.

Unencumbered now by dog we moved along faster because we didn’t have to make phone calls about dog. We finally made it to the James River by 5 pm and our shuttle driver got us soon after. Turns out it was Stanimal himself. Stanimal is his trail name from when he through hiked a few years back. The Glasgow Stanimal’s is smaller but it’s just us 3 and one other hiker named “Fossil”. I asked about his name and he replied that he’s 78 and thus his trail name. We get breakfast included here and Scotto's down the street had dinner food. Resupply will be at Dollar General and the local very small grocer which are a few blocks away. A shower felt so so good.

My fall into the weeds the other day has resulted in a small patch of poison ivy on one leg. Itchy but hopefully short lived.

I was jealous of Curt last night because he got the VeggieTales blanket.  


 (Look at me.   With some time today I figured out how to write the HTML to insert a picture into the page)
Breakfast this morning was blueberry pancakes and fresh cookies.  Nice!   Dinner last night was pizza, salad and beer.   It was good to get something green again.   
Right now we're sitting outside around a fire at about 55 degrees with a cup of coffee.   Pleasant.   A train whistle goes off as it rolls through town.   Rural Virginia. 
Today we'll resupply and plan tomorrow.   I think we'll have Stanimal’s shuttle us 20 miles south and we'll hike north for a day.   That's a nice break from having a pack on our back and we can go downhill more than uphill.   Between the joint pains and blistered feet we all have, it might make things easier.  Plus that 20 mile section has bad bear problems and you shouldn't camp there anyway right now.

Best slack pack ever today!   Breakfast was peach pancakes! We took along lunch and enough water for a few miles and Stanimal drove us - Jeff, Curt, me and Sea turtle who is with us at the hostel  - up to the Blue Ridge parkway near the Cornelius Creek Shelter.   We started north from there and made good time.   Great weather and mostly nice trails made this a great day of hiking.   We hiked through a variety of flora including dense vegetation which happened to be where an aggressive bear has been causing problems.    We made lots of noise and had no issues thank goodness.   That was another reason we slack packed and did not camp.   Part of the trail was similar to arid trails in Colorado or Arizona.   We finished with a mile or so along the James River.    Great day.   
Then we grabbed some hamburger from the butcher and grilled outside.   Mags made us all wonderful burgers.   
After dinner we gave Stanimal a hand moving some furniture for a poor renter he is helping.  Some heavy furniture.   Sad to see but we were happy to help.  Now I'm sweaty again.  Maybe another shower before bed.   
Early tomorrow we’ll catch an early shuttle to where we started today but we'll head south towards our next stop in Daleville.   I believe it's 37 miles of hiking away.   It's a short couple of days but you take advantage of resupply options when you have them.   Hopefully the bad bears haven't moved south! 
Sadly Curt will have to leave us for a drive back to Florida where he is a park ranger a Topsail Hill preserve state park.   He'll be there just in time for his wife Monica's birthday.   Happy birthday Monica! 
I am also remiss for not wishing Madeline happy birthday yesterday!   Madeline and my son Joe got married recently and we're thrilled to have her in the family.   Happy birthday Madeline!

We hiked 18.7 of the hottest miles so far today. Jeff’s thermometer read 85 at one point which is hot for up here.  It’s steamy too.   Add that to a lack of easily available water in places and we had a hard day.  
It started great with blueberry pancakes at Stanimal’s.   We settled up with them and Mags (not sure of her real name) then shuttled us to the same spot as yesterday.   This time we went south with full packs.  No slackpacking today.   Sea turtle hiked with us all day until camping time. He stayed at the Bobblet's Gap shelter which had one tent site.   We ate dinner there and hiked a half mile south to a stealth site allowing all of us to stay together. 
The guys behind me saw a mama bear and cub.  The cub was up a tree and climbed down fast to catch up with mom.  A short video that Sea turtle captured is in the videos. 
This was not Curt’s day.   It started with a tumble on the trail resulting in a few scrapes and a sore ankle.     It’s easy to do when the trail is gravelly, dry and steep.   He’s OK but with a couple more manly scars.  Then he got stung by another bee.  Lastly he conked  his head on the roof at the Bobblets Gap shelter.   Since that’s 3 bad things I figure he’s safe for tonight.   No bears will eat him.   It’ll be me or Jeff.
Our goal tomorrow is the town of Daleville.   Josh Sutton, father of Little Man Sutton,  is getting Curt on Wednesday,  August 23rd and taking him to Roanoke for a rental car for his trip back to Florida. For those who don’t know Little Man Sutton,  he was 4 when he started the trail with his parents in 2021.  He completed it at the age of 5.   We were fortunate to have hiked with them for a while.  I felt sorry for his Kindergarten teacher trying to get him to sit still after a through hike of the AT.  
Our last water of the day was at the Bobblets Gap shelter and it was a tiny trickle.   It took more than 5 minutes to get 2 liters.   There’s a resident turtle there who has been reported for multiple years and he was still there.  A nice place to hang out and eat bugs!Going to be hotter tomorrow.   Oh joy.
Oh and by the way  - Another shout out to Shaka and Hanalei from our 2021 hike for introducing me to ultralight CHAIRS!  I love getting into camp and sitting comfortably in my chair when the only other options are a picnic table bench, a log or the ground.  My back and butt thanks you.   I hope that you are well.

I hiked 18.2 miles today.   I say “I” because we had some issues today and Jeff and Curt couldn’t hike the whole distance. 
All started well.  Last night was pleasant on top of the mountain where we stealth camped.  We had a nice breeze all night.   My chair was handy there.   In the morning we got packed up and were out by 7:20.   Along the way we saw some peach trees with lots of small unripe fruit.  Curt said that they were delicious but not ripe yet.  
After several miles (probably half of today’s hike) Jeff stepped on an edge of the trail that gave way and down he went.   Luckily he didn’t fall down the hill but his leg got some scrapes.   The worst thing though was his knee twisted.   He hiked a while longer with this before it really decided to go out.   From then on it was apparent that his hike was over for now.   He slowly limped up the next hill and heavily leaned on his trekking poles to pull himself up with me right behind in case his knee gave way again.  We finally reached a dirt road that connected to the Blue Ridge parkway (BRP).   We ate lunch there and I hiked on while Curt and Jeff limped toward the BRP where they were going to call for a shuttle to take them to Daleville.  Along comes a guy on a mountain bike.  He stopped and after talking to the guys he offers Jeff his bike to coast down the mountain.    This allowed Jeff to move faster and with less pain.  Curt carried his pack along with his own.  People are amazing.   They say that “the trail provides”.  You never know how this will manifest itself.   A bike to help an injured hiker or a truck full of hunting dogs taking a missing dog back to its owner.   Amazing. 
At the BRP they called Homer the shuttle driver who is on the older side but likes to shuttle hikers whether they can pay him or not.   This got them to the lovely Super 8 in Daleville.  It’s right off the trail so that was good for me once I got in.   A shower and some laundry done and we hit the Mexican restaurant next door.   Of course I have to hike tomorrow so no 2nd margarita for me.  
I’ll miss these guys.   Who will share the spiderweb clearing duty?  It’s been fun but I still want to complete the AT in Virginia so I’ll continue.  260 more miles.   Yikes!
My next goal is the beautiful overlooks of Tinker cliff, McAfee knob and Dragons Tooth.    All are in the next 30 miles.   I may use the 4 Pines Hostel along the way to help me resupply.   Less food  = less weight  = easier hiking especially on the big uphills coming. 
It's been a fun time with Jeff and Curt.   Time for me to hike alone for a while.    You’re never really alone out here though.

Today I’m trying to give my legs a little break by slackpacking over the Dragons Tooth section. I did it southbound so I was immediately hit with the climb up to the Tooth. This almost killed me. I had to stop fairly frequently to rest. My legs felt like lead weights. Some of the uphill was rock walls requiring careful maneuvering. Honestly I think going uphill was safer than downhill. Beautiful view up there. For a while after I came off the peak the trail was rocky and sometimes so overgrown that you couldn’t see your feet. I passed a couple of hikers headings north but that was it all day. Several deer and a large black snake were all I saw wildlife wise.

With 4 miles left I came upon a Monument to WW2 hero Audie Murphy. He apparently died in a plane crash here in the 1970s. There were benches so I put one to good use and paid my respects. Since I had a cell signal I also called and arranged my shuttle back to the hostel for 2 hours from then. The downhill to my pickup point was so smooth that I did it in 1.5 hours and sat around for a while. 

I think I’ll slackpack again tomorrow. The weather is supposed to have a higher chance of storms so I want to be off any ridges early and quickly. These slackpacking days are expensive because of the cost of the drive but I guess it’s worth it. Plus this hostel is less expensive than others. I will need to move on soon though so that I can get some green food. It’s been a while.

Boneless Thighs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668391,"Ascent: 5738 feetDescent : 4905 feetI got a late start today because of a storm system that came through.   I hate hiking in the rain.   I’m not sure why because 30 seconds after you set foot on the trail you’re sweaty anyway.   The rocks get slippery and your feet get wet and it’s generally no fun for me.  BUT…it’s cooler.   And that is nice.   Today I waited until the worst of it was over and as luck would have it, another couple came in to do a hike and we shared a shuttle.   A $60 fee turned to $20 and I couldn’t pass that up.   So I dealt with some rain, slippery rock and steaminess in order to save some $.   No surprise to those that know me.  
I’m really trying to get some miles in when I can and the weather cleared up and dried up some so it was good hiking.   I got in late after almost 20 miles.   Water was scarce so I left the hostel with 3.5 liters which is 2 liters more than I normally carry.  2.2 pounds per liter meant my pack felt heavy.   Luckily today’s storm seems to have temporarily rejuvenated some of the water sources and I had no issues. 
Saw some interesting rock cairns supposedly built by farmers.  Some were about 8 feet tall.  They are on Bruisers knob.   Very out of place.
The hike started with slippery rock ledges much like Dragons Tooth but worse due to the rain, miles of loose shale to slip and slide on, and lots of low growing Mountain Laurel (near the aptly named Laurel Creek Shelter) that insisted on grabbing my trekking poles and trying to pull them out of my hands.   I saw a bear butt running through the woods near here.   A real bear.   I tried to take my time but found myself hurrying because of a forecast of more storms which so far have not materialized.   I’m sleeping in the shelter tonight just in case.   I’ll do battle with the mice probably.   Hopefully nothing bigger.  It’s fun to see the local weather forecast show up as Blacksburg,  VA since that’s where I went to school at Virginia Tech.  I can’t believe I walked here.  That’s nuts.
At the shelter I met Hannah and Dom from South Africa.   They work on yachts for a living and have a couple of months off for vacation.   Part of their time off is being spent hiking the AT.  They’ve only been out since Daleville but they seem to be doing really well.  They were fun to chat with.

Descent : 5220 feet

Today I did 23.8 of the hardest miles I’ve ever done. I got an early start around 6:30. The trail was normal for several miles and then it changed dramatically. Obviously no maintenance had been done by anyone in maybe more than a year. Dense brush covered the trail including berry bushes with thorns. I feel like my arms and legs have been rubbed with fiberglass insulation all day - very itchy.  I tried to push them out of the way using my trekking poles but then found that the hidden trail beneath was very rocky and those rocks were slippery. After a few rolled ankles and twisted knees I gave up on preventing scratches and went for safety. Unfortunately this continued off and on for many, many miles. It slowed me down but I had a goal of getting as close to Pearisburg as possible today and this stealth tent site seemed like a good spot. 

I feel desperately sorry for Dom and Hannah from last night. They’re going through the same crap that I hiked through. I hope they don’t hurt themselves. 

Besides the brush swallowing up the trail there were a lot of blowdowns over and on the trail. You have to step over the ones on the ground and duck under the others. I spent so much time hunched over that I feel like I’m devolving back into a caveman. I smell like one would have too I suspect. 

Too add to my fun today there was a pretty heavy fog around 4000 feet and drizzle off and on. I love my shoes but they are NOT good on slippery rock. 

At one point I ran across a guy with another bear dog. He had a bunch chasing a large bear but he said that it was back the way I’d come. If I haven’t said it already, I am not a fan of this kind of hunting. I’ll leave it at that. 

Wow. I just had a couple of crows fly over me and I could hear their wings flapping. Not sure I’ve ever noticed that before. 

Tomorrow I’ll hike about 10 miles into Pearisburg and stay at the Angel’s Rest Hiker Haven for at least one night. I’m hoping to slackpack again but we’ll see. I’ll be honest, if I find out that the next section south of town is like what I did today I am going to skip it. Trail like this ought to be closed down until the problem is corrected. Shame on the AT and whatever local club manages that stretch for allowing this to go on for so long.

Today my friend MASH is going to be proud of me. I got started a little later than I had hoped but even though the trail started as bad as it was yesterday, it turned into a smooth, easy, mostly downhill trek after a while. I had a little over 10 miles to go from my stealth tent site to Pearisburg and I made it in time to get the “coveted"" 10 by 10. Ten miles by 10 am. MASH was the master of this and it mostly eludes me except for our 30 mile day on the Centennial trail. I had motivation today because I was headed into a NERO in town at the Angel’s Rest Hiker Haven. This time I achieved the 10x10 by pure accident. I hit the road and saw that if I hiked hard I could get it. 

Otherwise today has been uneventful. No bears last night. Very foggy this morning up high. I’m at the hostel getting chores done like laundry, shower and drying all my gear in the air conditioning (ahhhh air conditioning) and sun. Everything gets wet inside and out either due to rain or condensation. I’ve also had the pleasure of catching up with family on the phone. And eating. At the local Food Lion I got a salad, fruit bowl,and a bag of tortilla chips and cheese. That was lunch. Second lunch will be a ham and cheese sub. Not sure what is for dinner. 

Mom and Dad mentioned a big storm/ hurricane coming up soon that I’ll need to watch out for. Sue is going to text me details because often I can get texts but not calls or anything like a web page or weather report. 

I’m still trying to figure out what is happening hiking wise tomorrow. 

Edit:  I am slackpacking tomorrow on a section south of here but I'm skipping (yes skipping) an 11.4 mile section because:
#1 - I've done it before.   A fair number of miles around here I did in college including some of what I'm repeating tomorrow in the Dismal Falls section.  I'd like to see that again.  I'm out here to complete Virginia and I don't care how long ago it was,  it counts!
#2 - I spoke to a couple of hikers here at the hostel (a shout out to ""Show Me"" and ""I Forget""/""Trail Magic"") and they indicate that this upcoming trail section is as bad as the last section I did condition wise.  As I think I indicated,  I won't hike anything like that because it's unnecessarily dangerous.

Today was a slackpack.   The forecast was for rain and storms.   The rain I got but no storms luckily.   In all honesty it was my best day of hiking yet.  I got wet top to bottom but it really didn’t bother me because I knew I was going back to the hostel where there was a shower and a dryer.  And it was cooler.   I suppose that I’m a bit weak when it comes to being uncomfortable for a long period of time.   Wet feet and being sweaty and dirty for days at a time is not fun to me.  
Anyway,  I got started in a light rain and it lasted for a few hours.   I instantly met an older shirtless man with a backpack with the trail name of “Tom Horn"".  Something about a Steve McQueen movie.  He was the most agreeable hiker I’ve ever met.  He obviously wanted to chat but after 15 or so minutes I needed to move on.   I was hoping for at least a 20 mile day and had no idea about the trail conditions coming.   I was a bit spooked by the last section of trail.   And, of course,  as I indicated in yesterday’s post, I’m skipping the 11.4 miles just south of Pearisburg based on comments from northbound hikers about trail conditions being as bad as what I just hiked through.   That along with the fact that I’ve hiked a large chunk of this back in college means I feel no obligation to repeat it unless I just want to see it again.   So I repeated the Dismal Falls section today but not the high sticker bush section that will destroy your shirt, rip holes in your gear, draw blood from several spots on your body.   
I truly appreciate what trail maintainers do but this area around Pearisburg needs help.   A lot of help.   “Tom Horn"" asked me today what I thought (unprompted) about that section north of Pearisburg and related that it had been like that for years.   He’s hiked these sections for a while so he knows more than me.
Once I got going the trail conditions were better than expected and I got moving quickly.   It was foggy and rainy so no overlooks were worth stopping at.  I ate bars for lunch while I kept moving and stopped only for a visit to Dismal Falls which was about 0.6 miles round-trip on a side trail.   Today's hike made my big toes hurt because of the many downhills.  I went through miles of neat tunnels of rhododendron trees that made it very dark and cooler.  Hard to see where to put your feet.
(Curt - your lemon Lara bar was delicious!  Thanks)
 The mileage I post each day does not include these little side trips to sights,  overlooks,  privys,  shelters, or springs.   These often add up to over a mile each day easily.   You never know.   The mileage I list on these entries is purely AT miles. 
The wildlife I saw today consisted of a box turtle and 2 explosive grouse that came flapping out of the woods a few feet from where I was walking.   This is my 2nd or 3rd experience on the AT with grouse and they scare the daylights out of me each time.   They are like bowling balls with wings and getting airborne requires lots of noisy flapping.  And of course I got stung twice at one yellow jackets nest.  Right after I got stung Jeff (Miles 2.0) texted to indicate that he had also gotten stung on his first walk out testing his twisted knee.  I hate yellow jackets.    Have I said that before? 
By 3 pm I was almost to my pickup point and I ran across another set of hikers who looked beat.  They immediately asked about the next place with water.  Sadly it was miles away.   They should have seen that on the app we all use called FarOut.   I gave them my spare 2 liters of water.   They were excited for what they called Trail Magic.  Each time I’ve carried extra water and not used it myself I’ve been able to give it to someone else.   When everyone says that “the trail will provide” sometimes it’s you doing the providing.  I’m ok with that.   Besides Tom Horn they were the only people I saw today. 
After I returned to the Hostel I got a shower and cleaned my muddy hiking clothes.   I dried my shoes in the drier by tying a knot in the laces and hanging them inside the drier door with the knot outside.  Worked like a champ.  Someone else’s idea, not mine. 
 I grabbed some food at the Food Lion nearby and dinner at the local Mexican restaurant and hung out with Trail Magic and Show Me for a while.    Then I went to visit Dom and Hannah (who I met at War Spur Shelter a few nights ago) who survived the jungle north of here and just rolled in today.  They are super nice and fun to talk to.  If they can survive that hiking mess they can survive anything.   They mentioned tonight that they’ve also done the hike to Everest base camp.  Sadly they will be moving south at a slower pace than me.
I believe I will be taking a zero day tomorrow.   If the weather is less rainy than expected I may pack up and leave but for now it’s a zero day.

Zero day today. No miles on trail. No ups or downs. While it is needed I admit I feel funny about not hiking. I can’t sit still. I walked to Hardee’s for breakfast and had a nice long chat with Sue. Then for lunch Trail Magic and Show Me invited me along to “The Happy Hog"" where I had an awesome BLT, broccoli and fries with lemonade. Lots of lemonade. 

As the sign said,  I called my parents and had a nice chat with them about the upcoming hurricane/ tropical storm heading their way. Hopefully not a big deal.   We're all thinking about weather. 
The walk was good to keep things limber but it was fun hanging out with these guys. The guy I hike with tells me the same old stories that I’ve heard over and over. (No I don’t. Yes you do. Let’s not argue about it any more.)

The zero day is good for my feet but the weather here is calling for storms at some point although as of 2 pm they seem to be evaporating before they get here. That doesn’t mean that over the mountain where I’d be hiking they aren’t getting rain though.

I picked up supplies for 4+ days this morning. I’m disappointed because the Food Lion didn’t have SPAM in single serve packets. Greasy, salty – what’s not to love. It’s become my favorite trail meat. My next resupply is 75 miles south at The Merry Hiker hostel in Marion, Virginia. I’ve heard great things about them. Once I resupply there I ought to be able to complete the last 63 miles in Virginia. Fingers crossed. As I’ve seen, you never know what the trail conditions are going to be and what might slow you down. The next few days are supposed to be good weather and cooler. High temps from the 70s to mid-80s with nights in the 50s. I can only hope. 

I have paid my bill here and packed up so I’m all ready to go in the morning. Marion - here I come!

Today was a hard 21.9 miles BUT I am finally under 100 miles left in Virginia. 87.9 to the south side of Damascus and then another 4 miles to get to the Tennessee line and another 4 to get back to Damascus. A total of about 96 miles. I’m ready to be done I think. I don’t mind doing some hiking alone but this has been too much for me. 

It was chilly last night - probably low 50s and I was glad for my 40 degree sleeping bag. Although todays hiking weather was absolutely perfect, the terrain was different from yesterday and consisted of a lot of angled mossy rocks that looked slippery. I was careful on them and thus slower. Then I went through a massive field where the vegetation on the trail hadn’t been cut in a while. It was like hiking through hay interspersed with tons of poison ivy. There were lots of flowers and bees. So many bees that it sounded like the violins in an orchestra tuning up. They were loud. 

After a painful climb I reached the Chestnut Knob shelter at elevation 4409 feet. Not sure but that may be my highest point yet. The view was beautiful and interesting because the shelter had a door. Perfect lunch spot. 

I saw 4 other hikers today. One was going southbound like me and the others northbound. Not much interesting animal wise. 

I almost stopped at the Knot Maul shelter and couple of miles back but since I had to carry water anyway, I decided to continue to the Possum creek stealth tentsite near VA Route 42. I’ll hear traffic all night I suspect but it’s the only option near here. I sure do hear a lot of loud animal noises coming down the Gorge from up the mountain. Might be an interesting night. If my food gets swiped by a bear then at least I can hitch a ride into town easily.

Last night’s tentsite was creepy. It was at the mouth of a canyon for Possum creek and every sound anything made up there seemed to be amplified when it got to me. I expected that the nearby road would be the problem but it was not. All sorts of animals barked and yipped and growled all night. Nothing came close to me or my food though (as far as I know). 

I was out of camp and hiking by a hair after 7 and soon after hit some pasture hiking. My shoes got soaked. The cows watched me warily and some just snorted and ran away. Possibly my smell. It was pretty hiking. Whenever you hike in a pasture with animals they make you enter and exit using something that prevents the animals from escaping. Today it was mostly ladders that can be slippery when wet. I made it across several of these safely. Two of the entrance/ exits were best described as tight little mazes. I barely fit through with my pack so no cow could do it.

As I hiked today I decided that today should be my NERO day and I should just resupply and get right back on the trail. Then the further I walked the more I realized that I wanted a shower too. So here I am in Marion at the Merry Hiker hostel. Once again I seem to be the only person in the bunk rooms. My shuttle driver graciously took me to the store for resupply. Curt and Jeff would laugh but I’m sure I have too much food. Hiking after a resupply is painful due to the heavy pack.

When I was waiting for my shuttle I saw that there was a Mexican restaurant in the Exxon there. I had time so I got a burrito dinner. Since I smelled so bad I decided to get it carry out and eat it outside. I sat on the sidewalk like a homeless man and ate my burrito. The station manager came out to put new bags into the garbage cans and found some still full bottles of shampoo, etc. She came over and offered them to me. I really did look homeless I guess. 

 In the hostel I got my chores done - laundry, shower, dry my gear and my shoes, repack the food and take only what I need. Any extra food (or equipment) that isn’t needed for this leg is left in the “Hiker Box"" for someone who needs it.

My shuttle driver is going to pick me up at 8 am and back to the trail I go. The mileage left in Virginia is dwindling. I’m excited to get to Mt. Rogers which is the highest point in Virginia (5729 feet). I hope they use switchbacks for the climb and don’t go straight up it! Why the AT doesn’t go right over the peak I don’t know but you have to hike an extra mile round trip to hit the top. The peak isn’t any big deal either. It’s in the woods. No view or anything spectacular. I’ll do it anyway just to say I did. The Grayson Highlands is also supposed to be beautiful open grasslands populated with wild ponies. Very much like Chincoteague and Assateague islands. 

Lastly today I met Mr. Pickles on the streets of Merion. Mr. Pickles is the unofficial mayor of the town. He’s a cat. 

People holler from their cars and many stop on the street to say hi. It’s pretty funny. I love it.

Descent : unknown 

For some reason my app won’t tell me the ascent and descent totals for the day. I hiked 30.7 miles which is the most I’ve ever done in a day. Hiking with Dave (MASH) on the Central trail our last day was about 30 as well. The trail today was a pretty smooth an the ups and downs were gradual. No straight up or down thank goodness. Given the bear situation around here I wanted to have a bear box for my food and that means no stealth camping.
I partially attribute my long day today to my food intake yesterday.   Besides the Mexican lunch I had ice cream,  a salad,  and then went to what I thought was a Chinese restaurant called Yummy Yummy.   Turns out it was Japanese.   I didn't know what to order but ended up with steak that was delicious.   Just what I needed.
The trail started with more pastures, some getting my feet pretty wet. Mostly easy terrain and even though I didn’t get 10 x 10 I was close. At the Partnership shelter near the Mt Rogers visitor center I met a section hiker from Quebec. That shelter has a shower and restaurants actually deliver up to the visitor center. I should have stayed there! After hiking a few more miles I heard a gun go off 30 or 40 yards to my right. Scared me to death. I gave a loud Hello and scared the hunter equally badly. A couple of guys out hunting squirrel. They offered me one. Hmmmm. Not sure how I would have seasoned it. I only have soy sauce. Squirrel teriyaki. I decided that maybe my gray cap was not a good choice today. I saw no more hunters luckily. 

I passed a lot of NOBO hikers today. Most due to the holiday. One I recognized from 2 days ago. She is older and Asian and we chatted briefly both times. Today I greeted her by saying Hi Again. We’ve met before. It turns out that Hi Again is her trail name. Funny. She just hikes a couple of days at a time apparently northbound. 

Usually I like to hike fast if the trail allows it and today’s trail conditions were good for long periods of time. They used switchbacks everywhere and miles and miles of the trail had hardly any rocks. I went fast when I could but slowed down over the rocky stuff.  Sometimes my downhill looks like flailing legs and trekking poles but it's sort of under control.  
A couple of places had tourists hiking to waterfalls. I was really hoping for some locals carrying beer and that they’d offer me one. That would have slowed me down. 

When I passed the Trimpi shelter I determined that I had time to get to the next one. You never know how the trail conditions can change but I took a chance. I made it to the Hurricane shelter a little after normal dinner time. I believe that this sets me up for Mt. Rogers and the Grayson Highlands tomorrow. I hope to do fewer miles so that I can enjoy the scenery. Maybe I’ll see some of the ponies the area is famous for. Maybe even the one named Fabio!

Descent : 2654 feet

I hiked 16 miles today but those are just AT miles. Add to that a mile round-trip to the peak of Mt Rogers and about 0.6 miles to get water and it was a decent day. It was really cool in the woods but in the sun it got hot. At least it is dry.

I had a great conversation with a guy last night at the Hurricane shelter. Curt would have liked him. He carries a coffee percolator and has decent coffee each morning. He was going to make me some but slept in and I missed out. His little dog Chico is apparently a good mouser in shelters but he tented since I was in the shelter and he smoked. No mice luckily probably due to the monster black snake I saw close by. 

Trail today was rooty and rocky. Especially rocky for long sections here in the Mt Rogers area. Lots of big steps or big rocks you had to climb over. Then there were areas where the trail was smooth and easy tourist stuff through fields. I knew that I was close to the Mt Rogers area and the Grayson Highlands area when I started seeing people. Lots of people. Hundreds and hundreds of people. It was a shock. In places where the trail was skinny I had to pull off the trail to let folks and the inevitable dog go by. I saw 3 people who were having to carry their dogs due to injuries. It was slow going but that’s what you get for hiking in a popular area over Labor day. Lots of weekend backpackers too with the inevitable 50 pound pack. Some I’ve spoken to are actually carrying all their water. It’s good to chat with others and learn what they are doing. How else would I have found out about my awesome chair!

Dealing with the people was worth it though. The scenery here is amazing. As I climbed higher I could look back on where I’d been. At one point I went through a tight squeeze called the “Fatman Squeeze”. I had no problems getting someone to take my picture. Lots of people are headed to the Mt Rogers peak. Even now at 5:30. The funny thing about the peak is that there is no view. Just a surveyors medallion at 5729 ft. It’s in the woods but the woods look like something out of Jurassic Park. All pine and damp and mossy. Very different from anything else we hiked through. 

I got a choice spot to camp tonight just below the peak at 5387 feet. Incredible views and the occasional pony comes by to say hi and get a dust bath on the trail next to me. I’m hoping that they don’t get too close later on. They also have longhorn cattle up here but I’ve only seen one of those. No Fabio yet. They are all so cute, especially the babies. 

My cell service is spotty here so probably no pictures tonight. I’m hoping that the stars tonight will be bright. I suspect I’ll be up to check them out.

I realized before I went to bed last night that tenting out in the open gave me a great view but that the dew was going to be bad. I was right. Everything was soaked inside and out unless it was in a bag. Tent, sleeping bag and pad, my clothes that I was wearing. The only way to dry out would be to stop in a sunny place and unpack. I didn’t want to take the time so I have wet stuff at camp tonight. I’m camping at a low altitude stealth campsite so it’s humid and no air is moving. Going to be a long night. 

My knees are hurting after doing 22.6 miles with lots of downhill. From an elevation of 5413 feet to 3159 in about 3 miles. That was the steepest part of the day but it kept going down from there. Of course there isn’t anywhere to go but down from Mt Rogers. Trail conditions were mixed with large rock steps at times, big gravelly avalanche sections, but long stretches of faster moving, fairly clear switchbacks. Some slightly overgrown areas with itchweed (stinging nettles) made me cuss a couple of times. In theory you should usually find jewel weed near stinging nettles and the juice from the plant should help ease the sting. I’ve done this before with some success. It was there this time but I didn’t bother. Give it 15 minutes and it usually 

 I traveled through some more beautiful open grasslands but no more ponies. Lots of great views though. My pictures won’t do it justice. My distance goal today was to get to wear I can hike into Damascus by 10 am and text Sue. While she is driving the 3.5 hours down from our cabin I’ll hike the 8 mile round-trip to the Tennessee border thus completing Virginia. That’s the plan. We’ll see how it goes. 

I’m back to a relatively empty trail. I only saw 3 people today. A few deer as well but that was it. 

I paralleled the Virginia Creeper bike hike trail for a while today as well as beautiful Laurel Creek. Lots of bikes on the trail today. Right now if I was closer to the stream I’d go jump in. I’m soaked in sweat. Can’t imagine I could get any wetter. I’m greasy and disgusting too. Sue might not let me in the car. 

One more day and I’ll have completed the AT in Virginia. It’s the longest state at about 550 miles which is ¼ of the entire AT all by itself.

Total AT miles today was 9.5 miles (with an extra 3.5 back from the border) before noon. I’m excited to have finished Virginia on a beautiful day weather wise. Supposedly rain is coming so I lucked out. I’m sitting on the lovely front porch of the Damascus library hoping Sue will find me. It’s lunch time and I will NOT be eating tortillas or peanut butter or any type of protein bar today. 

Hiking today was easy. Partly because I knew I had limited miles to go and partly because my pack was practically empty. I have almost no food left.

On the way into town this morning I stopped at a gas station and grabbed an orange juice and a Gatorade. I downed the OJ and took the Gatorade for the trip uphill to the Tennessee border. This is a town that seems to like the AT and the hikers. Most but not all I’m sure. Outside of any AT town there always seems to be a few homeless encampments. Damascus has a big Trail Days celebration each year and there are a number of businesses catering to hikers and bikers due to the beautiful Virginia Creeper trail. One church even had a sign saying We Love Hikers. They haven’t smelled me yet. 

 Once I made it through town (the AT goes right through the entire town) the trail looked like it went through someone’s yard. And of course it went uphill largely towards Tennessee. Nice trails up and back. I took the required pictures by the sign to prove to myself that it wasn’t all a hallucination. And that’s that. An awesome trip at times. Miserable at times too. Beautiful scenery. Virginia is not flat I can tell you that. I missed Jeff and Curt these last miles but it is what it is. 

Will I do any more long distance hiking? Right now probably not. Give me a few months and ask me again.
