Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664954,"Teddy and I headed out from home after my evaluation and made it to Mount Crawford, VA. Driving on the interstate was horrible. I can’t see anyone behind me, even the big trucks and they get so close that I start to sway and have to break to stop the sway…which is the exact opposite of what I want and what they want. I determine tomorrow I will get up early and be able to make the time without traveling on the highways. 
We stayed on a beautiful property called Marceline Vineyards. Once we arrived and setup, we met a couple from NY who were also using Harvest Hosts and played trivia with them.

Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664955,"I slept well and woke up to a wonderful morning with horses feeding on dew covered grass and cool temps. I woke up knowing that today was going to be the day I see my honey and I was so excited to be on the road. I set my Apple Maps to avoid highways and off I go…such a better drive for the first 1.5 hours. 

I arrive at a Walmart and finish my shopping and get a bite to eat. This takes up precious time and when I get back in the car, I would arrive to Blue at 1327, not acceptable. I must take the highway and the same people at get there at 1230. Off I go, but it is worse today and I decide the only way I can drive on the highway is to go 55 mph on a 70 mph high (unless we were in a construction zone) with my blinkers on. The blinkers did keep the big trucks off of my backside, but not the cars…I was so pleased to get off of the highway. 
I arrived at 1300 and he arrived just minutes later, ohhh what a joyful moment. We headed out to a new host, Appalachian View.",,View Entry,"Jun 01, Thu",0
Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664976,"Blue has decided to hike a 10 mile day today instead of taking a zero day and taking it tomorrow. I spent the morning getting the Alto ready for both of us. I also spent the morning getting to know our host. Then it was time to go get Blue.
Once I picked up Blue, we went to Cabela’s and other errands. Teddy was great at Cabela’s and at Panera bread.
We tucked ourselves in for the night. 
Appalachian view (Deb and Bob) are great people and so kind. They provided us with water and electricity and also allowed us to dump. Such great hosts. I’m getting to know the harvest host family, and they remind me of the Appalachian Trail family. A group of kind people who offer their place of business or their yard for the use of others. I am so thankful to my friend Sandy for introducing me to this program.",,View Entry,"Jun 02, Fri",0
Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664977,"Today was our first zero day together. Blue and I went grocery shopping to both Walmart and Aldi‘s. We also picked up some things for our stove from Lowe’s hardware. After we arrived at our new host, we set off to Hopewell Furnace NHS.  Teddy earned his bark ranger for this site and received a free bark ranger badge. He was introduced to sheep, and while he had some difficulty, he listened to my commands.We arrived back at our host families yard, and were able to meet our hosts. We have been stressing about where to stay on Monday through Wednesday night but they came through just like the trail angels they didn’t know they were. They offered for us to stay two more nights, and we were able to get a harvest host for Wednesday night. You know the kindness of strangers is very evident. We are very tired from our zero day and are laying our heads down for the beginning of Blue’s first full day of hiking tomorrow. I promise I’ll have more entertaining journals to come; as we begin this journey I will get to do more things along the way to share with you.",,View Entry,"Jun 03, Sat",0
Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664978,"Went through several little towns , Shartlesville and Historic Hamburg. I stopped at two cemeteries, and checked my Find a Grave app, but they didn’t have any photo requested either one of them. The morning drive back to the alto was fantastic, thru farm land and towns and forest land….no fighting trucks. 
It’s a day full of chores: doing laundry, cleaning alto. I wasn’t able to dry the clothes completely at the laundromat so I had to keep switching the clothes I’m drying outside on the four hangers that I have. I may need to buy more hangers.


I had my first adventure in detours, and I was able to find my way back to our host. Our host family is part of the fire department and explained that they had to use the jaws of life to take a person out of a car on the road and that is why they closed road. 


I actually took some pictures today of the two towns I drove thru and the host. 
It is time to go pick up Michael and start our evening together. Good night everybody.

Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665054,"Today started very early with getting Blue on the trail. He is hiking southbound today because of parking for me. 


Once we got back to the Alto, me and Teddy were freezing, it was 55° in the camper. We turned on the heat crawled up for a nap. We woke up about 45 minutes later and then ate breakfast. We are now walking on the D&L trail. When I take Teddy on these walks, I like to let him scent and stay wherever he wants to smell for as long as he wants to. At home he can run and walk and sniff as long as he wants. The only control he has out here in the world, is to stop and smell something. It does make walking consistently more difficult. 


After walking, Teddy and I went shopping for some needed items, not many, just a few. We did have to go to three different stores to get them and Teddy was able to go in 2 (Aldi, Target, Walmart). We found a collapsible basket, just perfect for the Alto at target with a couple of other camper items. Teddy did great in Walmart and Target and is early in getting the comments about being a service dog. I do not tell people he is a service dog, they just assume. 


Once all errands were done, we went back to camp to prepare ahead of time dinner since Blue will be getting home so late. Well we took a small break first and then worked. 


On the way to walking to meet Blue on the trail (I parked .4 of a mile from the trail) I was talking with my friend Sandy and I saw a black bear cross the trail I was walking on. It was about as tall as my chest…no picture as I was talking and I was walking Teddy. He was so busy munching on grass, he didn’t see it. What a way to end my day. Off to the Alto and dinner already prepared.

Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665123,"Today is all about the Appalachian trail. I will be driving Blue between points today, all in all I will drive him to three trail heads, one twice. I have bought trail magic and will try to distribute it throughout the day.  I am going to surprise him at the second stop with magic  


Gave trail magic to: Out and about. Lawsuit and Cookie Monster from Minnesota. NomNom from North Carolina. Lexicon from NJ. Medicine Man and Sugar from Kentucky. Lighthouse from N. Virginia. 


Ended the day with pizza and frozen custard.  Teddy did great with the hikers but without his walk, full of energy tonight. Tomorrow is moving day after I drop Blue off. Good night",,View Entry,"Jun 06, Tue",0
Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665164,"Today was moving day. After taking Blue to the trail I started cleaning and putting things away. It is amazing how easy it is to have things out of place when you stay days in one place. By 10 I was on the road. 


We had conserved well over the 4 days and our tanks were at 81% and 78%. My mission for the day was go to a dump, grocery run, and travel to new host. Sounds simple, not. 
I paid extra on Harvest Host for dump sites; well they really don’t know where they are or if they exist. I traveled to two near by sites to find businesses at the address and no site. The third site I chose was a state park… Walla, no dump station. When I traveled to this site, I had missed the main entrance and went by to find the back entrance, I was followed by a park ranger. When I pulled into the back entrance, he pulled beside my car. I told him I was looking for a dump station. He said “we don’t have one, I don’t believe, if we did, which I don’t think we do in the 13 years I’ve been here, it will be by the bathroom.”  In all the parks that I have visited I have never found a dump station by the bathrooms, so I believe he was right and there was no dump station. He did tell me where a small RV Park was down the road and I was able to pay $20 to dump there. 


All of this took me four hours with a brief 30 minute pause to grocery shop in the middle. Then I was off to our new host. The new house was only 40 minutes from our old host but with all the traveling that I did I was an hour and 10 minutes away. The good news is is that the new host was less than 15 minutes to the trail where Blue was ending his day.
I got set up, disconnected, waited for the host (as requested b the host at check in) to come over and invite us to a wine tasting. When I told him that I had to go pick up Blue from the trail, he said well we’ll start without you and if you want to come when you return you can come at the end. He was leaving to go to town for 15 minutes, and upon his return he started the tasting.  I didn’t feel very invited. There’s another family staying here that went to the tasting. 


Just as well, I’m having a lovely evening with my honey, and the grounds are pretty and the pond is pleasant.",,View Entry,"Jun 07, Wed",0
Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665209,"Today was a better day than yesterday.  The day began with a walk by the pond with the mist rising above it. Took Blue to the trail and came back and ate breakfast. Then broke down camp. 


Today is a very slow day. It took less than a half an hour to get to my new site. I went to Walmart before I arrived and picked up a few things Blue wanted. I had to get on the highway today, but it was only 3 miles from where I had to turn off and a traffic jam started .8 miles before then luckily it just started and we were not in stopped traffic so it only delayed me a 10 minutes


I set up at Kittatinny visitor parking lot right on the AT. This is my first site in which I am less than a mile from where Blue will end for the day and he will walk right by me and continue .5 miles to make tomorrow easier. 


Teddy and I took two walks today and the rest of the time hung out at the campsite. I did some laundry. I attempted to plan some but the signal is horrible, I will plan some more tomorrow. I did make some calls to some places and was able to secure one site for the next week.


Waiting on Blue to walk by and I will pick him up a half a mile from where we’re camped. 


My cell signal improved and I was able to plan all the way thru next  Wednesday. Good night.

Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665259,"Today I left Kittatinny Visitors Center in pursuit of three things. Number one: get a stamp for Delaware Water Gap, accomplished. I had to drive to the Delaware water gap headquarters at the very end of River Road, but well worth the hour trip. Number two: get my new prescription from my doctor and replace the prescription accidentally thrown out for Blue. I traveled to a local pharmacy and requested the prescriptions. They said it would be at least an hour if they could fill them. About an hour and a half later I received a text that the prescriptions are filled. I will pick them up in the morning. Number three: sleep on a real farm. My nice lodging tonight is at a working farm in New Jersey called Mohican. It is a very nice host and Teddy had to learn to live with an ostrich. I’ve given you a photo of a close up of Teddy, but in the distance you can see the ostrich. He is such a quick learner.This farm has a petting zoo, which we didn’t take part in because of Teddy, a nice market and cows and donkeys. It was easy to spend the $20 recommended in the market, and I tried for the first time, sweet potato bites and I love them. Today was also spent taking several walks on the property and planning nights for sleeping in the future. Tomorrow I get to see my honey again. We are sleeping in a state park for two nights in the beginning of the week and two nights in the end of the week, High Point State Park. Tomorrow it will only be six minutes from picking up Blue.Good night

Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665321,"The day began with new life. A baby calf was born this morning, just as I emerged from the Alto. The farmer standing next to the fence and proudly announcing he had a new calf. What a precious gift to see. I was mesmerized watching the little one’s first steps. Now it’s time to get to work and packing up.
I picked up the prescriptions and headed to High Point state park. 


We got to our campsite and I set up our camper for the next two nights. I travel to the park headquarters and registered for my camping and met Burger. He is retired and hikes often, and he’s taking his cousin every weekend on hikes on the Appalachian trail. He has aspirations of hiking the trail next year.


I am ready to see Blue and spend the evening with him, I miss him so. On the way to getting ice and then to the trail head we saw a big black bear on the road and Teddy did see the bear the time. He barked in his beagle bark at the bear. Waiting at the trail head for Blue.

Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665362,"Last night it rained and we all were happy to have a hard sided roof over our heads. 
Took Blue to the trail this morning and at the trailhead we saw a bunny. Teddy chased the bunny and got all wet from the rain left on the grass…the bunny got away but he had fun. 


Today is a chore day with laundry and grocery shopping. We are going to walk around the campground and then do chores. The campground has the basics but no dump station or water filling station. We have a very nice secluded site…it is very tranquil. 


A was in a turtle jam today, at my campsite, but I didn’t do the stopping. A title climbed under my car and was not moving. I had to gently encourage with my broom stick, he/she was not happy. 


I went to a nice laundry mat and then to a very busy Walmart. Teddy was golden in both. He made me so proud. 


Once I got back to the Alto, it was very hot inside and I folded dried clothes outside and hung wet clothes on my windows to dry. For the rest of the afternoon I spent time checking on clothes and working on cooling off the Alto. Then it was time to pick up Blue and bring him back to camp. 
Good night.

Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665404,"Today starts a series of one night stays in NY. My day started with finding water and a dump station. Finding a dump station has been hard and the state parks in NJ that I have stayed at do not have dump stations.  I hunted and found a new website called sanidumps and it was comprehensive. I found a dump station 15 mins from my camp site and I called them before I traveled. They only charged me $10 and they were very nice and had propane too. I am all full and empty now. On my way. 


I am sleeping at a fun castle establishment on a highway 17 mins from the trailhead. They are very nice people and have a great place for kids and adults alike. It is called The Castle of Fun. I setup and walked the grounds until time to pickup Blue. 


We stopped at Bellvale creamery and had a sweet treat. This creamery reminds me of the one the used to be at home across from my road. Such good ice cream.

Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665481,"Today I am staying at Taft outback. After sleeping at the castle fun center next to the highway I am hoping that we will not be near another highway. Blue has been working very hard with hiking and the trail has not been kind to him. I hope his hike today is better than in the last few days.Sorry for the delay posting this, but when I arrived at the home, I was staying at the owner desired company. Me and Teddy kept her company for several hours.  And then went into the Alto and planned another day.  I’m quite proud of myself because I called the post office in Kent Connecticut and requested to stay in their parking lot and they approved it. This gives me ideas about other places to stay as we’re going along. I have section hiked all the way up to Connecticut but nothing past. I do have a desire to see the little towns that I would’ve hiked had I continued all the way to Maine. More to come.Blue got in very late and it was 35 minute drive. We picked up Kentucky fried chicken and went basically to bed. Good night.",,View Entry,"Jun 13, Tue",0
Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665482,"After dropping Blue off at the trail and returning to Taft outback, I sat with the owner for about a half an hour. She told me about her plans to visit Florida this winter. She is such a sweet lady. I need to get packed up and get going down the road.I made better time than I thought I was going to and arrived near my destination a half an hour early.  Teddy and I decided to walk around a softball field and have a little scent walk to kill some time. I am set up in someone’s home again tonight, but it’s in the whole neighborhood not a city. We do have power and water, and are taking advantage of that, and charging all of our devices.  I am so glad that I took Teddy on a scent walk earlier today because it has started pouring down rain and then sprinkling and then it will pour again. The weather forecast says this is the weather we’re going to have for the next four hours or so.As I was sitting here in the Alto and in the rain, I was thinking of Blue and the traveling we would have to do tomorrow from High Point State Park. We had made a reservation for Thursday and Friday at High Point because nothing was available around the trail but I took another look today at a state park in New York, close by the trail, and there is now availability.  I had to a pay reservation penalty for canceling my reservation so close to that arrival date, but it was worth the cost to get closer to the trail for Blue. Blue has been getting into camp anywhere from 6 to 8 at night. I am looking forward to our short day on Friday and zero day on Saturday and hoping he gets much rest.Until tomorrow",,View Entry,"Jun 14, Wed",0
Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665546,"We had a very nice evening at  Hudson Valley. On our way from the trail yesterday I saw a beautiful cemetery. I made plans to stop at that cemetery. On our way back I stopped. When I arrived at the cemetery this morning the visiting hours were 8 to 6 and I was a half an hour early, I was willing to wait because it was such a beautiful cemetery but when reading the rules it said no dogs allowed leashed Horton what is shake because I would really love to see if I could help some people whose family are buried in the cemetery this morning. I’m on my way back to the park in Valley and Blue has given me some more days to plan for. I’m really enjoying having electricity and water so I’m going to look for some more sites with electricity.


We have arrived at Clarence Fahnestock State Park. NY state parks are nicer than NJ and cheaper. We have a bath house with hot water and a sink to wash dishes with with hot water. There is not a dump, but with the newly discovered website, sanidump , I should be able to find one. I won’t use it so much with the bathhouse and dishes station nearby. 


No luck finding sites at all on Harvest Hosts for the next part of our journey in Connecticut. I did find a park in New York that shares a border with Massachusetts and Connecticut, Taconic State Park. NY state parks are relatively inexpensive to stay in and for three nights in Taconic State Park I paid $67. because it shares a border with Connecticut and Massachusetts. It’s a short distance from the park to the trail on three different nights. I am quite proud of this find. 


Teddy and I took a long walk in the campground and on a trail and I have some beautiful pictures to share with you. We are now just chilling in the camper waiting for the time to pick up Blue. Talk with you tomorrow.

Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665594,"The campsite is wonderful, out of six sites in one field only two are occupied.  I started the day with a shower and walk with Teddy. Then we had to go buy some stuff at Dick’s, and Teddy had his nails trimmed.Because Blue is walking a short day today it was time to pick him up.
We traveled to Connecticut and went to Weir Farms national historic site. It was a wonderful site with lots of information about art Mr. Weir. He was an impressionist from the late 1800s and his family had his generation and two more that continued with art on the site.  The national park service had done a fabulous job in restoring and improving upon the art done at this site. They also have an artist in residence that continues to develop art. I will attempt to upload some of the photos that I took of the garden restored, and some of the new art added.
Then it was time for us to come back to the Alto, but it was raining and I was tired. I took a nap and then went and did laundry. After my laundry was done, Blue had found a fabulous Chinese restaurant that made me shrimp fried rice without soy. Then it was bedtime. Good night.p.s. I am not able to upload the garden photos, too large.

Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665687,"Today started out to be a fine day, but ended very quickly.  At the trail head after dropping Blue off I attempted to start my car unsuccessfully. I thought I have AAA I’ll give them a call at 6:47 in the morning. I called them and I put in a ticket and they said it’ll be there about 7:52 AM; so Teddy and I decided to wait.  We did a little bit of planning and got some nights booked but no AAA at 7:52 AM.  I waited another half an hour and called them back.  They assured me that they had the right location and that the driver would give me a call and give me an update in5 mins.  Now it is 8:47 AM and NO call. It was pretty cold in the car and Teddy and I had moved to the backseat and snuggled up and my phone was dying, I started getting nervous about this time. I had reached out to my brother earlier in the morning, sharing my location when it first happened, just to make sure he knew my location and he had already called AAA at 8:15 or so. Now I reached out to him with text messages and we decided to not use the phone. I had no way of charging my phone, my car wouldn’t start. Blue called me at 9:48 AM and said he’s been getting messages from AAA and they didn’t know where I was.  Mind you, my brother had called them a little after 8 and shared my location with GPS coordinates, so he gave them an earful.  He told them I needed a battery even though they wanted to tow me and give me a battery tomorrow, unacceptable.  Blue and I decided it would be best for me to leave the car and walked the 5/10 of a mile back to the Alto. He had told the AAA driver to call me before they went to my car because he was having me walk.I felt much more secure and much warmer at the Alto. I was to finally able to eat breakfast at 10 o’clock in the morning and charge my phone.  The driver finally arrived at my car at 11:16 AM and called me and said I’m at your car again the AAA driver; again did not follow instructions. I told him where I was and asked him to pick me up. I got a jumpstart and never turned the car off again until I got to AutoZone and got a good battery. I will say that the Corrado’s were very kind to me and allowed me to stay on site as long as I needed to and we even had a plan for if I had to stay another night to move the Alto into a different parking space. You would think that would be the most that happened to me today. After I got set up at Tony’s deli and picked up Blue, my stomach started cramping. I spent the evening not eating at Tony’s deli and only drinking water, and must have made 10 trips to the toilet. My body was rejecting every solid food that was in it. Needless to say, I didn’t have much energy last night to write my journal, so I am writing it this morning. It allows me to look at my phone and have exact times of conversations. Just for information even though AAA says they will do a battery on site. It is up to the individual drivers that pick you up.

I was able to shop and arrived at the trailhead at 4:10 PM. Blue was slowed some. I changed the plans and we are staying at the trailhead instead of the post office. I feel secure here and Blue can walk out of the Alto and into the trail in the morning.

Teddy and I went for a walk and he became covered in ticks just from a walk on the road. I am glad we didn’t wait too much longer because the road was getting hot. 
After our walk, we started packing up the Alto.

I dropped him off at the trail and decided since it was not raining I would get chores done early. I got gas, cleaned the car (it really needed it with all the mud) and went shopping before going back to camp. 
It all took me about 2 hours with traveling. 
Blue did not get back mid afternoon but at 5:15pm. His clothes have been soaked the past two days and badly in need of washing. We have access to a washing machine at camp so I am doing laundry now. Not the night we planned but a zero day is coming up on Wednesday. 


This camp ground is great and I am really glad we chose it. It is in the middle of his two hiking destinations and has everything. I would recommend it to anyone. Good night.

We made it to a great camp ground called Greenwood Lodge and campsites. We are at a beautiful site with electric and water. 
Just before the heavy rain began I completely set up everything. 
I then had my book club with my sisters and my niece is going to join us with the next book.

Their home base is Florida and they are home schooling their 4th grader. It was very pleasant conversation. Teddy met the local rabbit and he was so funny.  This is to e first non-wild bunny he has ever seen.  I would never let them meet without the fence.I then cooked some lunch and started finding places to sleep for our new hiking plan. The next section I am planning for (NH) has many days where I will be camping without Blue. I found the at I feel more comfortable by myself in a campground. I have booked a campground listed close to the trail in the AT guide. Another late night for Blue so we went out to eat.

Yesterday I had chores to do which included shopping and also was able to give a little trail magic with the ride.
Today I dropped Blue off at the trail and a Tramaly (trail family-those hiking together on the trail but not related to each other) was at the trail head. They were gonna walk up the road to have breakfast at an Irish pub. Blue suggested that I give them a ride. It was a great time and they invited me to breakfast and I brought them back to the trail. When I returned back to camp, my camp neighbors and I played a game called trekking the national parks. After we finished the game I packed up because today is moving day. The ride to my new home for tonight was long, but it is such a beautiful place as you can see from the photos. Tonight Blue is camping and I will pick him up tomorrow evening. Tonight it is just me and Teddy. This is the beginning of many nights that me and Teddy will spend by ourselves, as the trail gets more and more remote with fewer road crossings. Good night and Happy 4th. After I signed off a big thunderstorm rolled in. At first I heard the thunder in the distance and was unsure what it was. When I figured out that it was thunder I hoped Blue was set up and safely under his hammock. He is only going to be 22 miles from me tomorrow and may be closer now.

I had to go shopping and travel an hour to the campground. Since I don’t drive on highways with the Alto, everything took longer. 
Once I brought Blue back to the campground, he was kind enough to help me put the awning and carpet down before a huge thunderstorm was approaching our site. We are staying at Scenic View Campground in Warren New Hampshire.  What I am discovering about camp grounds on my journey is that the all inclusive and have everything tend to lean towards making money.  The private campgrounds that just give you a quiet place to stay, I like much better, and lean towards service and what the do have is very nice.

After a little while it started to get hot outside, and so we retired to the inside with air conditioning. I listen to a book of mine, chilled out a little bit, and even took a nap.
After waking up, it was time to feed Teddy again and take him for a nice long walk. There’s a nature trail in this campground around a river. Teddy discovered the rocks in the river and some sand, and he started doing his zoomies. He was so funny.  He even ran out into the river and splashed himself and then zoomed around in the river. He’s such a character. While we were out on our walk, we heard a little bit of distant thundering and a couple of drops of rain, so we hurried back to our campsite and secured our awning just in time for another rain storm. I know Blue is out in this rain as well, and I hope he was already at his campsite and secure when the rain came. I am now in the Alto, nestled down for bed and wishing Blue was here.

Picked up Blue, he was able to make it near the ETA, so I didn’t have to wait long. While I was waiting, I met two sisters giving trail magic. One is from Maine and offered me a place to park the Alto near Monson. Such great news. The other sister provided great hiking info (she is from NH) just as Blue showed up. Such a blessing to me these two ladies. The sister from NH hiked the trail last year and is now working on all the views in NH above 4000 feet.

I have a little bit more of setting up camp to do tomorrow. I will put up the awning but I don’t think I’m gonna put the carpet down because the front of the camper is very rocky.  The reason I like to put the carpet down is so I can sit outside and stretch, but I don’t see myself doing that on rocks. I might bring out the chairs so that I can sit outside, weather permitting. I like the awning because it gives a little bit more definition to our campsite and we have a nice campsite. I’ll take a picture of it tomorrow for you. I finished a book that my sister Anita recommended and it’s made me very thoughtful about the love that Blue and I share. Thank you Anita for sharing the book with me. Blue is sleeping at Lake of the cloud hut tonight and doesn’t have enough signal to post his journal.

I am sad that I’m only going to spend one day here but we have to move closer to Monson and are zero dayI have been missing home lately. I talk to my sister a good long time today because I had to wait to check out at her last camp site. It was a great conversation and I am so thankful to her. I plan on getting framed copies of Blue when he summons Katahdin and give it to those who have followed him on his journey. I will post some more pictures of Moxie pond. Now I have to go change out the laundry and get ready to pick up Blue.

Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667804,"We stayed in Greenville, ME instead of Monson. We visited both towns and I prefer Greenville. Because we had to get Blue’s prescription, we visited twice and both times there we stores open and people out and about. The atmosphere is nice and they are very dog friendly. Blue returns to the trail tomorrow and because of access to Baxter State Park, I will not sleep with him until he summits. I will reapply him in 4 days and be able to pay to see him at Abol bridge and Katahdin stream, the two night before he summits but he cannot leave the AT corridor to be eligible to stay at the birches. I will enter the park 2 times, the second the day he summits. I am sad but this is what is needed. The Baxter State park passes go in 5 minutes from posting at midnight at this time of year. They are posted 2 weeks prior to entry. I am sad that I did not know this. If I did, I would have stayed up. Spending the rest of my time with Blue today. Until next time.

Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667864,"Today I dropped Blue off at the beginning of the 100 mile wilderness. Lots of rain was forecast for today and the forecast was not wrong. The rain fell and the wind blew while Blue walked in the woods and Teddy and I stayed in the Alto. I will move tomorrow to Millinocket to Wilderness Edge campground. This will be my last campground. I hope to find a way to spend the night of the 14th with Blue, but it is not looking good. I will keep trying. Today I missed my Blue and wished I could talk or text with him. He had a very hard ford today and I was wondering if he chose the walk around or tried the ford. I hope the walk around with all the rain. Until next time.",,View Entry,"Aug 08, Tue",0

Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667960,"Since I last wrote, I have been busy. On Thursday the 9th, I drove Baxter State Park road and purchased an out of state season pass due to be coming into the park more than twice and it saved me money. I talked to park officials on how to drop off and pickup Blue and calculated the time between different sites on the parkThe 10th. The weather has lots of rain in it and I kept track of it and sent it to Blue. Because Blue’s summit day was horrible with rain and thunderstorms, I researched alternate ways to summit early on Monday and later on Wednesday. I spent a lot of time on the phone and web looking for sites for Blue to stay in and me still see him some.  I learned from a local resident that what Baxter is concerned with is parking. You can make a reservation for sleeping and sleep in your car. So I made some reservations and ran them by Blue. Because we couldn’t talk, I had to anticipate he’s needs.11th Today I see Blue and present the options, he chose to stay with me each night after 100 mile wilderness and take zero on rainy Tuesday.  I am thrilled with his choice.  While registering for Jo Mary road, I met another support person for her husband and offered for her to stay in the camper tonight.  We went and had dinner and we are spending time both for the guys (dry run at park gate for parking pass) and sightseeing. It is going to be a great day. Until next time.",,View Entry,"Aug 12, Sat",0
Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668022,Today Blue hiked to within 5.2 miles from the end of the trail. The weather has changed again and now Tuesday before 2 is better and only scattered showers instead of likely showers. Blue will summit tomorrow. He is staying in the park tonight to be able to start hiking as way as 4 am to beat the weather. I will not be going into the park tomorrow. You am glad for this journey to come to an end. Until I am home.,,View Entry,"Aug 14, Mon",0
Nightingale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668083,"My honey has completed his thru hike and I have him back. We spend one summer day together without the AT a focus. This journey has been so worth the effort and time. We will head home on Thursday.
