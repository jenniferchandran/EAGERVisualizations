Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663067,"Three years after starting these journals and two years after our (almost) thru-hike we are still trying to complete this trail. And now that we are both in our 60's and a little slower and somewhat more brittle we of course have some of the hardest miles of the trail left to go. We will be hiking in Maine so it will also no doubt be some of the most beautiful miles to go as well.
After the little sections we tackled last year we now ""only"" have about 140 miles left from East B Hill Rd to Rt 5 near Monson. It's really not that many miles. In 2021 we could have banged this out in under 2 weeks. In 2023 though it will be tougher because we'll be forced to live the section hiker life again and try to squeeze these miles into long weekends and do lots of driving back and forth up to Maine. We would love to get this trail finally finished but on the other hand it's also fun to know that there is more AT to explore. 
The plan so far is to get started on Memorial Day weekend. This is the first of 3 pre-hike entries to get this year's journal activated. More info to come...",,View Entry,"May 02, Tue",0
Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664229,"Almost time to get back out there on the trail. The upcoming Memorial Day long weekend will be our first days back. The plan for this one is to take it easy, we are not on a thru hike so we can do some things to make life easier. We will take 2 cars so no shuttles will be needed. We will slack pack between road crossings so that we can drive back to Coos Canyon Campground where we will be making our home base for the weekend. This way we can leave all the heavy stuff and do all our cooking at the campsite and travel light during the day. Basically we will be easing ourselves back into the life since it's been close to a year since we were last on the AT. Hopefully all goes well and this will be the first of several section hikes. Not sure we can fit it in but it's possible that we can finally finish the trail in 2023.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664719,"Last night we stayed at The Coos Canyon Campground after driving over 4 hours in separate cars, dropping one off on the way at the East B Hill Rd trailhead and then another 30 minutes to the campground. After a quick breakfast at a (not very) nearby Dunkin Donuts we were finally on the trail again around 9am hiking sobo from South Arm Rd.
Immediately we were faced with a water crossing where Yonder got one of her feet wet and then came upon the perfect campsite where we probably should have stayed last night had I known about it. The trail then started going up as the AT tends to do and we quickly met up and chatted with an early thru hiker who was traveling nobo with his dog Snoopy.

It then got tough pretty fast as the temps started climbing, the bugs started biting and the terrain was, well, Maine which is never easy. We were both struggling to keep a decent pace and it quickly became clear that the time estimates I had planned for were not very realistic. We had clearly lost our trail legs and it felt more like we were crawling rather than hiking. And then Yonder’s recent leg injury started acting up and it became even more of a struggle. 
Finally, over 9 hours later we reached our car that was parked at East B Hill Rd where we had left off last time. We drove back to the campground feeling defeated and wondering how we would be able to handle an even bigger mileage day tomorrow. Despite no rain and beautiful views of Maine, not every day on trail is going to be great and this turned out to be one of those not so great ones.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664720,"Yonder woke up with her leg still hurting and it became clear that hiking today would not be a good idea. We tried to make the best of it and instead drove around northern Maine which was actually pretty interesting and enjoyable despite the fact that it made us feel like an old couple out antiquing or something. We drove north through the Rangeley Lake area and circled around to Sugarloaf and then back to the southern side of Rangeley. We even looked at some real estate and toyed with the idea of moving up here to make it easier to finish our hike.
Back at the campsite we used up some old near empty fuel canisters to cook a dinner and enjoyed some local craft beers that we picked up earlier in the day.

It was not the day we had planned. It was enjoyable and depressing at the same time. It was the type of vacation day that most people our age would prefer but we would much rather have been out on the trail.

We will be back soon to try this again…

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666609,"I am writing the entries for this section on 7/9 after having a few days to think about our experiences on this last outing on the trail. If I had written this in real time it probably would not have been very positive as we were questioning why we were even out there. Right from the start this trip was a hard one.
Similar to the last time out we drove up the day before and stayed at Coos Canyon Campground. This morning we woke up to rain and drove to the trailhead on Rt 4 through a downpour. After sitting in our car waiting for the rain to let up we finally bit the bullet and headed out during a time when it was only a light sprinkle. The rain continued throughout the rest of the day and we had to setup camp in the rain which is always tricky with our tent. We managed to setup the frame of the tent with the fly first and then the tent itself underneath which is a backwards way of doing it but it kept the water leaking in through the top to a minimum. Even after all the miles hiked we continue to learn new tricks.

Once safe and dry in the tent we felt at home and enjoyed listening to the rain which continued throughout the night.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666610,"This morning we had the pleasure of putting on soaking wet socks and shoes which is something we only had to do a couple of times during the over 3 months we were on the trail in 2021. For this trip it was to become a daily ritual.
The rain finally letup today but it had been raining so much lately that the trail was a mess. For the next 3 days the trail was either a river or a mud pit which made the going extremely slow. Our favorite part of hiking is when we get into a rhythm which results in a meditative state and the miles just click away. This never happened on this trip. It took all our focus and concentration to stay upright and not sink into waste deep mud pits. Despite our extreme cautiousness and painfully slow pace we each had one fall today. We just can’t seem to avoid falling in Maine.

Our original plan was to stop at Sabbath Day pond and relax for most of the day but we decided to push on to make things easier on ourselves tomorrow. We found a great stealth site further down the trail and setup camp around 5pm after about 9 hours of hiking. It was discouraging to realize that today we couldn’t even keep to a mile an hour pace even though we did not take too many overly long breaks. Looking back as I write this I now realize that this was entirely due to the conditions and terrain of the trail but at the time we were both pretty down on ourselves and did not feel like “real” hikers or maybe we had just gotten too old for this.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666611,"Today we continued our excruciatingly slow pace and only managed to cover 9 miles in over 10 hours. Part of the slowness was due to multiple stops to dry out our feet which have been continuously soaked this entire trip. Trench foot is a very big possibility and one that we would definitely like to avoid!
Despite the constant threat of rain and our slowness it turned out to be a pretty good day for hiking. We were finally able to take off our rain pants and be more comfortable and the views were great all day.

We found ourselves another decent stealth site and quickly setup our tent as it began to rain. Once the tent was fully setup the rain suddenly stopped and did not return until we were off the trail the next day. Tonight, instead of fireworks, we were treated to the sounds of rumbling thunder as we dozed off to sleep.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666612,"No rain today! We were happy to have a short day left to go as the hiking was very hard today. Basically straight up Old Blue Mt and then straight back down with lots of mud and water along the way. To increase the difficulty level there were several sections steep enough where rebar was added and the temps today got into the mid 80’s.
It was absolutely beautiful out there today but neither of us could fully appreciate it. We were both hot, dehydrated, tired and ready to be done. Again it took us over an hour to cover each mile so, even though we had a short day planned we still ended up hiking for over 6 hours. In the last mile of the hike I managed to fall yet again this time right into a big jumble of rocks but I somehow did not get injured. The best view of the day was when we could see our car waiting for us through the trees at South Arm Rd.

Maine continues to kick our asses…

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668656,"Another long weekend, another long drive up to Maine. This time though the forecast looked good so we were hopeful that it wouldn’t be another suffer fest full of mud and rains and bugs and heat. The last couple of hikes have left us questioning why we are so obsessed with finishing these last miles of the trail. Isn’t 2000 miles enough? The answer is clearly no, we need to finish this thing so here we are again.
We decided to skip ahead to a section that could realistically be done within a 3 day weekend. Coming up with a plan was harder than expected because in Maine everything is so far apart that the options are limited. We considered slackpacking to make things easier but that looked like it would actually make things harder since the sections to do this would require 16 mile or more days and we are not sure that we can handle that kind of distance in Maine. So what we came up with was a plan that has us hiking no more than 8 miles a day which doesn’t sound like much but we will be going over some steep terrain in The Bigelow Range.

This time we went with one car which we parked at the Rt 27 hiker lot and got a shuttle from there to Long Falls Dam Rd. Because of how remote the area it was over an hour drive to our starting point even though the entire length of our hike will be less than 20 miles. Our usual method of taking 2 cars would have been taken forever so taking a shuttle was a no brainer.

Our driver Greg dropped us off at about 2:30pm and we started SOBO on some gentler terrain (at least for Maine) for a gradual start hiking around the southern end of Flagstaff Lake which was gorgeous. While still not back to our 2 mph pace that we were regularly doing in 2021 we made pretty good time and got to our destination for the night by 5pm with plenty of time to relax and get setup before the sun went down around 7pm.

It was a pretty good start and probably the best hiking day we have had this year.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668657,"Today was epic. Beautiful weather, awesome views, great people and challenging but not tedious hiking. The Bigelows are spectacular and we enjoyed every step of the way. Quite a contrast to our last section where we were just trying not to drown in mud. Today was dry and cool and the views were clear. We had magnificent views of Flagstaff Lake all day and we could even see as far as Katahdin supposedly though we were not exactly sure which bump off in the distance it actually was.

The NOBO thru hiker bubble was coming through so we met a lot of interesting people. And unlike the last time out, these were the more typical hikers that took 5 or 6 months to get here as opposed to the super human fast hikers that somehow manage to finish in July. In addition to the thru hikers there were a ton of weekenders out as well which made things crowded up at the summits and especially at the campsites. We got to our campsite just early enough to grab the last tent platform but many more hikers showed up after us that had to squeeze into some creative places. When we hiked out the next morning there was actually a dozen or so folks just laying out in their sleeping bags next to the trail because there was no place left to setup a tent. The only other time we have seen this big a crowd was at the beginning of our thru hike down in Gooch Gap. I guess this is another one of those section hiker problems we now have to deal with if we can only get out during holiday weekends.

Among the people we met were Action and Adventure, a couple about our age who had also mostly thru hiked in 2021 and were also finishing up what they had left for Maine. Yonder also had the privilege of granting a trail name to Troubadour who will be starting his own thru hike next March.

Further & Yonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668658,"The plan for today was to get up early and hike up to the next summit to watch the sunrise. As usual, this didn’t happen as we were too comfortable in our tent to get ourselves up in time. We did get up and out fairly early though and waited until the top of Avery West Peak to cook up our breakfast. This was supposed to be the spot in this section with the absolute best views and of course within 5 minutes of getting here the clouds rolled in and covered up everything. By the time we finished breakfast the winds had picked up, the temps had dropped and we had to bundle up, get our gloves on and start hiking to get down below tree level. Luckily the weather cooperated for the rest of the day and we were able to quickly get back to just shorts and t-shirts again and the views came back for all the remaining viewpoints.
The highlight of today was Horns Pond which had one of the nicest and largest campsites we have seen on trail. We hung out and enjoyed a peaceful lunch by the water and then moved on quickly being rewarded with a great view of the pond from above.

Our original plan allowed for an additional night in case we were moving as slow as the last couple of our outings but despite the steeper ups and downs we moved along pretty good this time around and made it back to our car by 5pm. We realized that it was the mud and the wetness those last couple of outings that really slowed us down and not so much our old age and loss of trail legs which was reassuring. Still, we were pretty tired and happy to be done. Three day outings seem to be a good fit for us right now. It’s hard to imagine that we went for so many days at a time in 2021 without decent meals or showers. I am impressed with our younger hiker selves when I think back about it now just 2 years later.
