Kevin Stewart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/440009,"Considering options for future hikes, checking up on my gear. Will be tough, I have a newborn son, so I'll have to nab a carrying bag of some sort for him. We'll naturally be limited to day hikes for a bit. Fun year ahead.","

Kevin Stewart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/440011,"picked up a few really cool toys today, located a jetboil flash, can't wait to play with it a bit. Good to go with my bucket of Mountain House entrees, got to test them out in civilized places so I know what is good. Had a bad experience once with a Wise Chili meal. It was crunchy, even after soaking, and it gave me the worst gas I could remember in my life. Altogether bad experience, only way it could have been worse is if it were in a bunker with survivalist types.","

Kevin Stewart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/440010,"Levi, when someday you read this over in prep for our hike, I hope you don't consider your dear old dad to be too much of a nut. You'll be ready soon enough, can't wait for springtime, by which time you'll be almost ready to hold up your own head. ^_^V",,View Entry,"Dec 16, Mon",0
Kevin Stewart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/446371,"AS the title suggests, I've been doing some long-term planning and experimentation of various gear. Some good, some atrocious. Everyone who's even taken so much as a water bottle into the woods knows, try it out beforehand, get used to it, and understand flaws. I learned today that I need a new headlamp. Current one is to be relegated to emergency gear box, as it has a tendency to turn on far too easily, like when it gets bumped. While it's nice to have a 90-lumen pocket warmer, I can think of far more economical uses for three AAA batteries.In good news, the Columbia fleece hat with shiny Thermarator insulating is awesome, head was still warm on 2 degree weather, and thanks to copious wearing, fits my head nicely. I'd call this new England winter a successful torture test by any means.Next on the agenda, serve a meal, complete with hot beverages, in this weather with only the Jetboil. Better hurry , Spring is on the way...HA!","
