I left home after shedding a few tears saying goodbye to my yellow lab, Winston. On the way to airport I received an email saying my flight was delayed and then another one saying it was cancelled. Tim and I continued to airport and for 2 hours I worked on trying to find another flight. Again, shed some tears due to stress. Finally got one going into Tampa instead of Orlando. I said goodbye to Hubby and went thru security. My backpack was red flagged and I was pulled aside. I learned tent stakes are not acceptable in carry-ons. Checked in my pack and went thru security again and this time the homemade fudge in my coat pocket was red flagged but after being pulled aside again they let me keep it. I was delayed in LaGuardia 3 hours,¬† finally reached Tampa at 12:30 am, picked up by my cousin Carla and reached her home at 2:45am. We packed this morning and on the road to Georgia by 10:45am.

We hiked on to Springer Mountain and reached it at 10:20am. Now we can officially say we are on the trail! We continued onto Hawk Mt Campground and set up camp. My 1st night in the tent, filtering water and cooking a meal. I brought along a mini cribbage board and we played a couple games with another hiker we met, trail name, Legs. We broke camp at 8:20am and hiked to Woody Gap, a tough 13.1 miles.¬† I've run into foot problems and hoping a good night's rest will help the soreness. We decided on taking a shuttle into town (Suches, GA) staying at Above the Clouds Hostel. We give this place an A+! Lucky, the owner took 4 of us to a BBQ place and then brought us back where a hot shower felt wonderful! Got our laundry done and a comfy bed. Goodnight all.","

Blood Mt is the highest point in Ga on the AT. (4458 ft) We hiked down to Mountain Crossing which is a stone building that the AT goes right through. Saw the Shoe Tree too, quite a sight.

On April 4th we went to the Clayton Cafe and had pastries as we waited for the shuttle to take us back to Dick's Creek Gap. We crossed into North Carolina! That was a big milestone for us. 1 state down and 13 to go. Lol It was the hottest day so far and a lot of uphills. We saw the oldest tree on the trail near Bly Gap and reached Muskrat Shelter by 5:30. We set up camp on the perimeter and watched a beautiful sunset. We did 11 miles that day and total on trail was 81.¬†April 5th-- it rained a little in the night so we had to pack up wet tents. We broke camp at 8:10 and planned on making it to Betty's Creek Shelter --16 miles away. Katrin met us on trail and hiked Standing Indian Mt with us. We lunched at the top and she had brought along some Trail Magic for us! Carrot cake, Skittles and chocolate easter bunnies! Thankful. Katrin turned back and we continued on. Was cooler and an easier trail today so able to get the 16 miles in. Happy 37th anniversary to my husband, Tim.¬†April 6th--We left camp at 7:50 and had a steep climb up Albert Mountain. We even climbed the fire tower and had magnificent 360¬∞ views! Shortly after that we reached the 100 mile marker! Big accomplishment. We reached Winding Stair Gap by 2:30, grateful for some trail magic before catching a shuttle to The Barn hostel. Is located on top of a mountain and had views of the Appalachian Mountains in the distance. Today is a lot of rain predicted, flood warnings and thunderstorms so Carla and I were taken into town where Katrin picked us up for a zero day. We resupplied and came back to Katrin's home in Murphy for relaxation, catching up with journals and spending time with Katrin.¬†Have a great afternoon All","

Yesterday was a tough day with the cold rain and I easily get chilled. The weather forecast said it should stop raining by 5pm so we decided to head out at 12pm and by the time we were ready to set up camp it would have stopped. It didn't. We left Winding Stair Gap and hiked 11 miles to Wayah Shelter reaching it by 6:15 pm, hoping there would be room in the shelter but it was full so we set up our tents in the rain. The rain stopped by 8pm but as soon as I had my tent set up, I crawled inside, put on dry clothes, skipped my supper and stayed right there til morning. Was a cold start to this morning's hike and I found out I do not like putting on wet shoes. Lol. We broke camp at 9am and the day warmed up nicely and we had the best views so far. We reached Wesser Bald Observation Tower and sat down, took our shoes off and had a relaxing lunch. We climbed the tower and had 360¬∞ views. The climb down had great views too. We set up camp along the trail and looking forward to a hot meal and a restful night.Good night All","

Ldyref,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661868,Hi AllThe last 2 days have been beautiful hiking weather. The mornings start out mid 30s but warms up nicely though the day to low 60s. We broke camp at 8 am this morning and started hiking the 3 miles down to Nantahala Outdoor Center. Katrin and her brother joined us there and hiked a ways with us before turning back. Was great seeing Katrin again. I bought some tights at the Outdoor Center to make sure I was prepared for when wet weather comes again...needed another layer.¬†I know without a doubt that I do have a heart because today I felt it pounding against my chest most of the day. üòÅ The elevation gains today were long and steep. Tyre Knob was tough but we had lunch on The Jump Up and the views were incredible. Then we tackled Cheoah Bald still going up. Great cardio workout today. We set up camp in Locust Cove Gap and felt good to call it a day. 13.7 miles. Total on trail tonight is 147.4 miles. Chipping away. üòäGoodnight All,"

We planned on a long day so was up early....before daylight in my defense. I went to retrieve my bear bag and could not find it tied to the tree I thought I'd tied it to last night. I thought a bear had the last of my pop tarts! But I looked further and found the right tree. Lol.We left camp at 7:12am and had only 2 short breaks, other then stopping to filter water. One at Brown Fork Gap Shelter and the other at Cable Gap Shelter. 17 long miles later we 'rolled' into Fontana Dam. We caught a shuttle to The Lodge, got a room, showered and headed down to the restaurant where we inhaled our appetizers and meal. Did our laundry too before climbing into a real bed tonight.Goodnight All","

We made a video,packed up and caught a shuttle back to the marina where we'd left off last night. The AT goes across the Fontana Dam! Was so neat! It's the biggest dam east of the Mississippi. Then we hiked 3 miles straight up into the Smokies. We took a little spur trail to visit the Shuckstack Tower and climbed it to get 360¬∞ views. Heights make me nervous but I was determined to do it and was well worth it. We then hiked on to Molly's Ridge Shelter, reaching it at 6:10pm and set up tents. Elevation is 4,570 feet so a little chilly tonight.¬†The AT is so rewarding...At times when you feel so exhausted you turn a corner or reach a Bald and see such beauty. With about 5 miles left to hike, we reached Doe Knob and it was like stepping into a Disney movie. Tiny white and lavender flowers covered the ground in a see of green, old, old blowdowns were covered with moss and white birches scattered around. The trail wound through this for about a half mile. Thankful for that. 13 miles today, 177.7-ATüòäGoodnight All","

A friend of my sister's picked us up at Clingman's Dome after we'd left Derrick Knob Shelter this morning and had hiked 10 miles to the Dome. Part of the hike looked like an enchanted forest. I half expected to see bread crumbs on the trail left by Hansel and Gretal and the Gingerbread house off the trail. Everything was covered with moss...the ground, the stumps and trees. We had a little rain on the hike and was a chilly day in the mid 40's. Luckily we'd just reached the Dome when it started pouring and even had some hail. She drove us to her nice home and we took hot showers, did our laundry and was served white bean chicken chili, homemade sourdough bread, homemade brownies and homemade strawberry cobbler with ice cream. I'm not ashamed to say I had 2 servings of EVERYTHING! Weather is rainy again tomorrow so taking a zero day to resupply and rejuvenate. Today we hit 200 miles on our journey!Yesterday morning we'd broken camp at 8:20 and headed out. We saw 3 deer right on the trail feeding and were able to video them. That was really neat. We climbed Rocky Top and sang the chorus to 'Rocky Top Tennessee ' on the summit. üòÜ 5441' and then got to the top of Thunderhead 5527'. We reached Derrick Knob Shelter by 4pm and stayed in the shelter instead of setting up tents because of impending rain. A first for us. Had been another beautiful day for hiking.
