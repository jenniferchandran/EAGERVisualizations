ShowMe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666839,"Back on trail after zero in Hot Springs NC.
AJ from the Appalachian trailer hostel, shuttled us in, skipping 20 miles around bear closer, around noon.
The trail mile market is 302 ish but we haven't hiked that much yet since the skip.
About 10 miles today, set up wild camp on old forest road section, can barley tell it was a road.  Got water from a good spring about half mile back, for dry camp.  Set up and ate small dinner before dark. Had to find a good tree for bear hang after first tree was too small for weight of a full resupply food bag.  Came across 3 bears late in the day, Magic used his air horn. 
Should be a dry night, day was warm and humid, some breeze.
We had a small dinner since earlier we ate our fries and tots we pack in from the tavern dinner left overs from night before. Good idea.
Also hiked along a cool Ridge walk, talk to trail maintainer, ate first wild blueberries, and hiked over Big Butt mt.
Saw a non rattle snake and a salamander. 
Magic also saw a buck deer and we stopped on the drive to trail so Magic could see his friend that lives by trail that he met and got trail magic from on previous hikes.
All this after a big town breakfast!","Hot springs
