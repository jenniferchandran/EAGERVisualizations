Above and Beyond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661316,"At Roan Mountain state park for a few days doing day hikes in preparation of the start of the AT later this week.  Tomorrow we plan on going to Carvers Gap to do an out and back on the AT since we are so close.  Yesterday was a little over 5 miles as we navigated the loop trails that connected to others and upon reflection, we have completed the majority of the trails here.  
My wife, no trail name yet, has used trailjournals for over a year.  She has been planning an AT flip flop for some time.  I figured it was my time to start using the site to go over my hikes and let people read the 'off-trail' side of this adventure.  
We have an RV and I'll be supporting her as she heads NoBo as well as joining her on hikes when I can.  From our mobile hostel she will resupply and take a night off trail when needed.  Reservations have been made for up to 2 week stays in campgrounds, centrally located on the sections she will be traveling.  We've mapped out through the first week of May and by that time, we hope to have a good idea of average daily mileage.  If someone else is looking into this method of through hiking, please follow along. 
Friday, May 31, we start in Front Royal. We will be on trail together for 5 days.  This will be my longest overnight hike duration so far.  Wish me luck.
We are both retired and I am working a part time remote IT job, which allows me a lot of flexibility to support her.  I'm also going to make youTube videos reviewing the campgrounds we stay.  Along with shuttling my wife, I am planning on playing trail angel.  So anyone that happens on this blog, I'll try to update locations a few days in advance.

Above and Beyond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661638,"First night on trail.  Dropped off by shuttle driver at 7:50 am on US522 outside of Front Royal and started moving north.  Made great time and arrive at Jim and Molly Denten shelter for lunch.  Feeling inspired we headed to Manassas Gap shelter and arrived mid afternoon.  With a forecast of bad weather and wind, the shelter seemed best and we didn't want to push on too far the first day.  Alas we were alone and had the place to ourselves and no real bad weather at all.  Except for the occasional train, gun shots and traffic noise, it was an uneventful evening.  
I'm feeling good about this hike.  I have only been on 2 other overnight hikes and this one is way better than Sipsey Wilderness in Alabama.  I'll never return there.","US 522 Front Royal

Above and Beyond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661639,"Awoke expecting rain.  I had the pleasure of trying out my Packa for almost 3 hours in every thing from a light drizzle to a steady downpour.  It performed and was money well spent. Arrived at shelter where there were some hikers already and an alert that a sizeable boy scout group was in route.  We filled the place up.  In the shelter we had a father / son set, my wife and I and a semi qualified minstrel with a 55 pound pack complete with Jim Beam and what appeared to be a mandolin / banjo thingy.  I should have taken a pic, it is hard to imagine.  Night was really cold and windy, by my 7 year old REI sleeping bag kept me comfortable. 
My longest hike has only been 2 nights and under 30 miles so I'm hoping I will hold up to this 54 mile 5 day excursion we have planned.  So far so good and I'm feeling better physically and emotionally as I have ever been on a hike.  Confidence is high.","Manassas Gap Shelter

Saw a few deer in the first few miles of it and other than the decent from buzzards roost, the PUDs were what I expected.  By the time we arrived, my feet were in need of rest and my blister was needing to be looked at.  When we arrived, the caretaker - unknown at the time - asked if we were headed to the brewery.  My skeptical side said this guy is full of crap, but he was not.  Beer and food were only .7 miles downhill and there we had drinks and enjoyed a building full of people at Bears Chase brewery.  
We awoke to a cool morning greeted by pancakes and hot coffee and an actual place to sit inside in the 37 degree weather.  With belly full and packs loaded we hit the trail and headed to our next destination while looking forward to finishing the last 4 miles of the roller coaster.","Rod Hollow Shelter

Now, on with my fumbling at the keyboard.  Today marked the longest hike I have done.  We are a few miles past the distance we thought we would do in 5 days (Blackburn Center) and I have high hopes of entering Harper's Ferry tomorrow shortly after noon.  
Today started with the last 4 miles of the Roller coaster.  I don't know if I had become accustomed to the ups and downs of the climb or if this side was easier.  We saw a few deer at mile 1 or 2 and they were completely unconcerned with us as a forest animal can get.  I love deer.  
By the afternoon the trail had just gotten to me.  Somewhere near the Blackburn side trail, I became tired, physically and emotionally.  There was just not much to see.  Even the terrain was blah.  Be it rocks or some overgrown area it just didn't seem to vary much.  It was mostly flat from what I recall, but boring.  
David Lesser is nice.  Lots of tent pads, most are level and somewhat free of rocks.  Shelter looks very modern and up kept. Water is unfortunately .25 miles down hill that at times I looked for a repelling team to drop in on us with empty Cnoc bags.  It sucked both ways, down and up that is.    
Scenery was good.  6-8 deer visited us at dusk, we had a nice view into a valley where we could see buildings and a road and cell service was great.  Had a chance to speak to my youngest for a few minutes and that helped.  Looking for ward to tomorrow.  
I meant to put a song lyric on each of these, and I have failed to do so until now.

Above and Beyond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662430,"What a beautiful day!We hit the trail just before 8 am and made fast work of the flat sections as we left David Lesser.  Nearing Harper's Ferry we came across a few day hikers, well manicured trails and some steep inclines as we made our way to the river.  I almost had to slide down some of the rocks nearing the river bed, but it was short lived and once we made it to the bridge and across, it was just another mile or so up the trail and into the town.
Arriving at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, Janet signed in as flip flopper, #40 if I recall, and had her photo added to the book there.  We noticed a familiar hiker's photo in there; a lady with her 2 young girls we passed the day before.  Made our way to a local eatery, had food and beer, and after a little mix up on shuttle drivers, we arranged for our ride home.  Hard to imagine I walked 5 days, about 55 miles and the car ride home was right at an hour.  The driver kept pointing to ridges and calling out shelter names and places we walked and to me, it was surreal.  I kept thinking I hiked that?  
Janet and I will return tomorrow morning to drop her off at Gathland State Park, MD for her slack pack south to Harper's Ferry.  I get to sight see the park, explore Harper's Ferry and hike around some more of the AT while I await her return.  Then back home to the trailer outside of Front Royal, move it tomorrow to Caledonia State park in PA on her zero day, and the day after return to Gathland where she will start heading north and eventually arrive in 4 days back home at Caledonia.

","Harper's Ferry, WV","Apr 04, Tue",9
Above and Beyond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663429,"Today I am doing recon work for my wife. Here's how we came to this. 
Janet has decided to hike from Deckertown Turnpike parking lot SOBO for 3 days to get picked up at DWG, PA. Reason is that leaving DWG NOBO, you have about a 25 mile hike to the next shelter. With 2 days of wet weather and more predicted tonight, it's more logical to start up north, hike SOBO to a shelter, then day 2 find a dry spot and be picked up the afternoon of day 3. 
Where's the recon come in? At the end of Day 3, assuming near lunch time in DWG, we drive back to Deckertown Turnpike and Janet hikes the 5 miles to High Point State Park office, making up missed mileage from all the rain. I get to hike it and determine if it can be done in 2-2.5 hours. It's cool, I get to do some hiking and hopefully get some photos to share. And I did.
First order of business is to take care of my business at the privy adjacent to the Mashipacong shelter. It's 500 feet across the road from the parking lot. Look up my video I made of this shelter. The inside of the privy is pink, 100% floor, walls and ceiling pink. But I'm off topic...
I fire up a podcast and start walking. Scenery looks really nice and there is not one soul on trail. I don't even see critters for the first 3+ miles. There's rocks in some places, more in others and puds that could best be described as pre-teen. Not that tall, not that challenging but annoying none the least. Rocks are different than in PA. Larger ones are smooth and look like boulders sanded down. Janet later mentions she read that during the ice age glaciers made it this far south and caused this scouring of the rocks. Sounds logical to me.Dutch Shoe - worth the visit:
I come across one hiker, trail name Joker, rubbing his feet. I pass him as he is NOBO as well. I later see him about 20 minutes after I arrive at High Point office. I passed a few elderly Asian couples out on a day hike just a half mile from the office making my 5.25 miles a very serene hike.
The office there is nice. Only open 8am - 4pm, but has a side door that goes to the bathrooms. There's water outside available 24/7 and places to sit. I arrive at 11am, just in time for a manager's meeting phone call back to Louisiana. I stand there and chat with my co-workers, more about the hike than anything work related, while a misting rain descends. Finish the call, eat lunch, put on rain jacket and SOBO I go, the 5 miles back to the truck. 
Rain stops as soon as I leave.  Yeah!  The trail looks radically different and I have more climbs SOBO. I come across an intersecting trail named Iris just before mile 4 on the return. It looks a bit shorter than the AT and actually curves back onto the AT .2 mile from the parking lot. To my amazement it is flat and rock free! Why the heck does the AT go the long rocky way? 
I pass a hiker coming towards me. Full pack and wearing rain gear on this bypass trail. Now, here's the odd part. I'm listening to Genesis, not the band (which I really like) but the book in the Bible when I see this guy. As he passes I see the distinctive white collar of a man of the cloth. I really should have stopped and spoken to this guy. I mean, what are the odds, on a side trail, my podcast and the only other living soul I see for 5 miles?
Total yo-yo for the day with the trip to the privy was 10.7 miles on my hiking watch. This matches up pretty even with the AWOL guide and AllTrails. 
Until the next hike, have a good day and be safe out there.Dale","A.T. Parking: Deckertown Turnpike (County Rd 650)

Above and Beyond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663408,"The morning started out dropping my wife off - trail name Willie - at High Point State Park HQ on NJ Route 23.  She had finished her hike there yesterday, where I shuttled her back to the camper for a nice night in a warm bed.  Her plan was not for high mileage today, so an 8am dropoff was easy.  We said our goodbyes and plans were made to meet about 8 miles down trail at a road crossing for lunch.  Lunch that I would pick up while visiting Milford PA.   
So, off I go back towards I84 and not a mile from her drop-off I see a bear desperately trying to cross the road.  He eventually makes it, spooked by the cars, but up the hill he goes to safety.  First bear either of us have seen since we started the hike 6 weeks ago.  
I make it to Milford, do a walking tour, pick up a few things at local stores and order lunch. Now, if you ever get to visit Milford, please do.  Nice place, lots of
things to see, a few places to eat - Naked Bagel is outstanding - and 
they even have a local brewery - all withing walking distance of each 
other with free parking on the streets. 
At this point Janet's (aka WIllie) Garmin Inreach has pinged her location once, about 1 hour from her start.  3 hours later I can only guess where to meet her.  I fire off a txt message while waiting for lunch and 30 minutes later she lets me know where to find her, our 8 mile tentative location is confirmed.  20 minutes later she pops up at the crossing.  
Ticks are everywhere.  She has one on her pants leg and before I leave, simply walking in the grass next to the truck, I get 2 on me.  I hate ticks.  So with full bellies we part again.  I decide to go see the Culver Fire tower.  I have all afternoon free and south I go.
10 miles and about 20 minutes later she txts.  Her clear glasses to protect from the gnats are missing.  I manage to pull over and they are not in the truck.  Lost on the trail I assume.  No problem I have 3 more pairs with me.  She asks me to meet her at another road crossing near Unionville, NY, and bring a bottle of water to for hand washing.  
I fire up the GPS in the truck and get a route to Unionville, then the Google Maps on the phone to find NJ 284.  How did we exist without technology?  I find zero convenience stores along the way and only one grocery that looks like it dropped out of time itself from the set of ""Oh Brother where art thou?""  Hardly any water in there, but there is a gallon in the cooler.  I also need water for my hike and all I have are empty bottles in the truck.  A mile down the road, she's waiting.  We fill one of the empty bottles from lunch and down the trail she goes.  
By this time it is after 1 pm and she comments if anything else goes wrong she'll have me pick her up at the next road crossing and forego the Pochunk shelter. I look at Google maps for orientation and there's a Craft Beer and Wine Garden a mile away.  



Well now, things are looking up.  I enjoy a cold one, only one, and head south again.  Not hearing from her again and the Inreach functioning properly, I follow the GPS instructions and make it to the Culvers Gap parking lot, which is where the title of this journal comes from.  
I fire up AllTrails to get an idea of the distance.  1.6 miles from the lot with only 1 climb.  I got this.  That's a 45 minute walk including vistas, if there are any.  There actually were.  One was at the top of the climb where the rocks give up their podiatric assault.  Not completely open for pictures, but a decent view of the valley and hills below.  The next was just a few hundred yards from the tower and it was grand.  A huge smooth slab of rock that allowed room for the 7 other hikers enjoying the view when I arrived.  
We chatted a few minutes about hiking, birds and those damn rocks of PA before I moved on to find the tower.  OOH, the first tower you come to is a large microwave and cellular one just off trail.  Don't bother, it's behind a large fence and you should not trespass.
The AT passes within 20 feet of the fire tower.  You can climb to the second highest level, the highest being the small locked enclosure at the top.  I counted 50 or so steps and it is rather safe.  There's a picnic table with yet another great view.  It was very much worth the 3.4 miles to do an out and back or a yo-yo as my wife tells me it is called.  I recorded it on AllTrails, so hopefully it uploaded properly.  
On the way back I passed one hiker catching his breath on the rocky incline.  We spoke a few minutes and he felt overjoyed when I told him the rocks would end at the top.  Assuring him it was only another 100 yards uphill and then it leveled out, he marched on. 
I received the ""I'm stopping here for the day"" txt the little Garmin sends when Janet has reached her destination. Today was the first day I was still on trail and she was settling in for the night.  Arriving at the truck a little after 4:30, the GPS shows me a nearly direct shot back to Port Jervis and the end of a long, but rewarding day with great weather. 
Looking forward to seeing Janet Tuesday as she will be nearly finished with NJ by them, I think...","Culvers Gap parking lot NJ 206 / AT crossing

Above and Beyond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663518,"Janet, aka 'Willie', is slack packing today.  I dropped her off in NJ, just shy of the NY state line where I retrieved her yesterday (a weary looking hiker she was) about 8:45 this morning.  I made it up to NY and into the parking area on Lakes Road.  This would be 11.8 from where she started and we would determine if there was time and accommodating trail conditions to make it to the next road crossing beyond Lakes road, adding another 5 miles.  
I get on trail about 9:30 after finding the incorrect 'side of the road fit for 4 cars' parking area. No one is there and I manage to wedge the truck between 2 trees and off the road.  So, let me explain that.  I have a Ram 2500 crew cab with a large trailer hitch on it.  Total length is about 22 feet.  I do not fit in most parallel spots on the street. I fill up a parking lot space and choose to back into places where some won't destroy a shin or hood (yes, it sits tall being a 4x4) if they run into me.  So, I back up between 2 trees as far off the road as I can get leaving all the space I can for other hikers.  2 guys pull up beside me - they are out for a day hike going my direction.
I follow them and we chat the entire 3.5 miles until I cross 17a near the creamery to continue south to meet my wife.  Not a half mile before meeting Janet I run into a familiar face.  It's Betty!  She's a 70+ year old retired school teacher (so I'm told) I met about a month ago on a yo-yo outside of Caledonia State park.  She happened to be one of the two ladies Janet met at a shelter 2 days ago, the other trail named Twister.  Janet didn't make the connection, but I remembered her from that brief encounter a month ago.  I was really glad to see she was still on trail.
I see Janet and we're both having a really good day hiking.  Plans are to have a hot dog at the stand on 17a and then an ice cream at the creamery and hike back to the truck and see where we are in terms of time and energy.  We hear from another hiker the hot dog stand is closed, bummer.  Ice cream for lunch it is.  
That was amazing ice cream and I highly recommend it.   Back to the truck we go deciding to try out a Greek place about 15 minutes away.   
On the way back, we cross over 2 huge rock formations.  The first had no name on our maps, the next is Cat Rocks.  


Janet and I seem to love climbing these things. First one I did was knife's edge and I guess the thrill stuck. These had some very deep cracks and just wide enough of you fell in you may get wedged up to your chest. Both had blue trails around them, which was a good thing for those not part mountain goat.
Back to the truck we make it, after a half mile hike downhill. I have come to the conclusion that downhill can be very bad onteh knees and feet. We check the time and decide Greek food and a beer will bring us to about 4:30pm or later so we call it a day and head home.","Lakes Road, AT parking lot, NOBO 1379.8

Above and Beyond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664939,"Yesterday was a zero for both of us. With refreshed feet and a good plan we started where we came off trail 2 days earlier.
I wanted to see Fitzgerald Falls and then hike to Mombasha Hill or high point or whatever they call it.  Fitzgeral falls was nice, not that big, but pretty.  Glad I brought the camera.  Mombasha was not much but a big rock, but something that made for a really nice easy hike.  On the way back I stopped to get pics of the falls and met a hiker called Doctor Danger.  I happened to come across him a few days later at Bear Mountain, but I'll get to the entry later.  
Photos completed, I drive to the pickup point at Lake Tiorati and start hiking SOBO.  Janet is going to have a hard day today before she gets to the Lemon Squeezer, and I hope to arrive there when she does.  As it happens I am a bit quicker and the first few miles of the SOBO are really easy and nice.  I stop about a mile or so from the truck and have lunch at 11 something and continue on my way.  
The scenery here is so nice and peaceful.  It is warm, but easy walking and there are places I just want to sit and watch the sun set, but other plan take residence.  I make it to the Lemon Squeezer and wonder just how they hell does one climb down this damn thing?  

I manage to drop myself off an 8 foot 'cliff' without injury.  I then take off my pack and walk sideways through the Lemon Squeezer and continue hiking.  I pass a trail maintainer somewhere along the way, before or after LS I don't recall.  We chat for a minute or two and off I go to find Janet.  
I tell her about cliff I had to descend and she tells me Betty and Twister were just behind her and to let them know about the bypass I found.  I did that, then raced up to catch up to Janet, mistake as I was already tired.  We return to the Lemon Squeezer and she finds the correct way to go up the cliff I dropped off of.  With all that fun done, I take the bypass trail and come back around to get a photo of her reenacting the climb.  About that time we meet the trail maintainer I ran into earlier.  
Long walk back.  Whether it was the long fight to get here, the increase in temp or whatever, the return tip for me felt like an eternity.  I was so glad to get back to the truck, get some gatorade and rest for a bit before driving back to the trailer.

Above and Beyond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664932,"Well today was the longest one day hike I have ever done.  
We parked at the AT lot on Main Road in Tyringham, MA and started the day out early.  I think my watch said I started recording at 7:30am.  Unfortunately my watch died about 3 miles before I ended the hike stealing from me the entire record.  

It was a 7.5 mile hike to the Upper Goose Pond cabin.  The cabin is .5 miles off the AT and has a caretaker, multiple privys and tenting platforms.  We enjoyed a lunch there and spoke to the caretaker.  Another hiker arrived just before we did and was setting up for the night awaiting friends. I had met him the prior day on a yo-yo.  Didn't catch his name then, but I heard him introduce himself to the caretaker as Bear.  Hard to forget because he has a bear paw tattooed to his chest.  
After lunch I parted ways with my wife at the AT.  She headed NOBO and I traced my steps back SOBO.  On the way back I came across a local dayhiker that lives in the area and is making his maiden voyage to the cabin.  We chatted a bit and soon after I came upon 2 section hikers.  One, if not both, from PA and a scout master based on his hiking shirt.  Today seems the day everyone is out or passing through.  
At a stream crossing I saw a young lady filtering water.  Not to frighten her (I saw her ear buds as she turned her back to me to face the stream) I called out.  Her trail name is Canary and started in Georgia in February.  I'm sure her pack weight is 25% of her body weight, but she's making fast work of the trail (I came across another entry a few days after this where she blew by some other hikers on this blog north of VT9 near Bennington).  Lastly I came across another young lady that was hiking for a few days on trail and I don't recall if she was filling in a section or just what.  I happen to see her again in a few days on Mount Greylock at the shelter I stayed in.  Regrettably I never got her name, but she commented that she had seen me a few days prior.  
Somewhere along the trail I came across a hiker - possibly Canadian based on accent and Maple Flag patch on his pack - and a through hiker that was also parked in the same lot as I am.  He has a camper in the bed of his truck, and carries a motorcycle on the hitch.  He either drives the motorcycle to the end of the hike and hikes back to the truck or vice versa.  Today was drop off the bike and drive truck in the morning.  It was in the low 40's and I agree a 30 minute ride on a motorcycle was not the way to start the frigid day.
As I said, this was the longest one day hike I have done.  My feet were telling me how tired they were so I rested on a rock at Webster road crossing about 3 miles or so from the truck.  That was when I noticed the watch had died and with one less chunk of technology to look at, I exited the podcast, put on some music and slack packed my way back to the truck.  
I drove to the pickup point on West Branch Road.  It is just a half mile off the paved road, but had a good packed gravel roadway and 2 parking spots next to where the AT crosses it.  Janet arrived about 30 minutes after I got there.  With zero cell signal, unless a walked back up the road a ways, I was content to just sit and wait and rest my tired feet.","AT Parking, Main Road Tyringham, MA

Above and Beyond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665559,"I don't consider my self an experienced hiker.  I have never camped alone on trail and other than the few times where my wife (trail name Willie) and I did overnight hikes, my experience has been loop hikes and in the last few months, a lot of yo-yos.  It is said you never see the same stream twice and in doing a yo-yo I get the same effect on the AT.  It is interesting how the same path looks radically different nobo vs sobo.  Today was not as such with mostly flat terrain and a few field crossings.  Also for once I have a few loop options that left and reentered the AT within a mile, one near a lake.   I followed the 3 ladies as they talked of all topics from foliage to men. I stopped a few times for photos as I have taken to bringing my DSLR camera.  Camera phones are handy, but a 16 year old Nikon will do me proud everytime. I made a mental note as I passed the loop trails.  These appeared on Google maps and All trails so I felt confident the detour would be worth it.  Once I got to the turnaround at just under 4 miles I popped in some music and started back.First loop was near someone's home.  As I passed earlier I noticed someone moving grass in a huge field in a riding lawn mower.  As I sucked off the AT I passed the freshly mown area and noticed the owner has an adorandak chair and what looks like a food plot for deer. Very nice.   I followed the trail, sort of a 4-wheeler path, and came across a deer stand.  Continuing along the trail I veered more and more away from the AT and intersection point.  Damn...Undergrowth was not bad so I bushwhack a few hundred yards knowing the AT is out there somewhere.  Finding it and checking for ticks I head nobo again.The next loop is actually marked and leads to a lake.  Will finish this entry this afternoon.","3 mile road

Well, here we are at part two of the AT hiking adventure.  So much has changed since this began I feel we need a recap.  Past experience will not dictate the future, but with all that has gone wrong, I look forward to something positive and look away from the stresses of the first half of 2023.
So, to bring everyone up to speed, this began nearly 2 years ago.  I decided I could not commit to a through hike with my wife, but I could support her along the way.  Preparation was tracked like any proper project with most tasks and milestones completed in early winter 2022.  Unfortunately by then we had lost one of our 2 canine travelers and our next one was to leave us in early 2023.  My wife and I had set our retirement dates were and we began 2023 with lots of time off, using up additional leave we had on the books.  Our ""retirement project"" was nearly complete.  
...and then in mid February my mom's health suddenly took a turn.  Her cancer free diagnosis was premature and within a month we had her funeral.  That same week in March 2023 we left for Tennessee for a pre-hike before starting in Front Royal on the last day of the month. Lost a pet, lost a parent and retired all within the first 75 days of 2023.  
I knew my dad's health would continue to decline this year.  When we left in March, he was about to have a one year anniversary in hospice. In mid July 2023, he began to rapidly decline and his time was very near.  It took 3 days to drive from New Hampshire to Louisiana, trailer in tow, knowing I might not get there in time.  Luckily I did.  He held on for 10 more days.  Fortunately, I was able to say goodbye and I hope he knew I was there.  This happened the week of my birthday.  
At this point, wife Janet was suffering from a pinched nerve for almost 4 weeks.  It began in New Hampshire on July 4th.  On my birthday she began feeling poorly.  She was admitted to the hospital the day after my birthday and stayed for 3 days.  On Friday July 28th, the day of her discharge, my sister called at 5am.  I knew why before I answered the phone.  Cancer had now taken both my parents in the span of 4 1/2 months.  Next year I hope to have a better July. 
I ring Janet at the hospital to tell her the news.  She calls her son to get her from the hospital as I head north (opposite direction of the hospital) to see my dad before his body is taken.  His funeral was August 2nd. 2023 strikes again. 
Fast forward 4 weeks.  Janet is feeling better and is ready to hike.  I have had four weeks of funeral arrangements, hours of phone calls, scanned documents for insurance and a stack of legal succession documents for me to deal with.  I'll make sure my kids don't have this much crap to deal with when I go.  
Oh, forgot to mention.  On the way home from New Hampshire, our hitch malfunctioned and parts of it broke off.  At least that's repaired and back on the truck.  
People, I've had enough.  I really have...  Fuck it. I'm going hike the AT South through Shenandoah and see where I go from there. Janet is planning our daily routes and with the addition of a new motorcycle, which we can carry in the trailer - it's designed to do this - or the back of the truck, we will now have a vehicle at the start and end of our hike.I write this sitting outside the trailer in amazing weather (unlike the triple digits in Louisiana) outside of Front Royal, VA.  Break-in day hikes start tomorrow, Friday 9/1 and overnights begin Monday.",,View Entry,"Aug 31, Thu",0

It started as a rather cool morning.  I will admit that riding the motorcycle in rain gear (to block the wind) in 55 degree weather was still a bit chilly for the 21 miles I had to drive.  It worked like this:  Drop Janet and gear off at US 522.  Drive to destination in Shenandoah park, unload motorcycle and drive back to start.  Hike to truck, return in the afternoon and pick up motorcycle.  Worked really well and I got to scare off a ton of wildlife on the return trip to the start.  I passed a dozen deer that morning and at least 50 squirrels (on the road).  
We hit trail at 7:55 am and with a cool morning it was a great start.  Hiking was smooth and after the crazy climbs of New Hampshire, this felt like a cake walk.  Now, don't get me wrong, there were a few rocks, a few hills and after 2+ months of inactivity, the feet and legs had to be reminded of what were there to do. 
We stopped for lunch at a Jenkins Gap and walked off the AT to enjoy the scenic overview.  This was just under 8 miles into the hike.  We passed a few day hikers and a few without packs.  Only 2 appeared to be carrying overnight packs, and they were both NOBO.  Didn't get any trail names but passed pleasantries.  Trail was very dry.  It is evident that there has been little or no rain for some time.  One water stop - Janet commented on Far Out - was a piped spring.  I guess we were about 6 miles in if I recall and it was flowing, but not very strong.  The ground was wet, but holding no water from this pipe.  Based on what she has read, it's dry out there and we're making accommodations for it by carrying 2.5 - 3.5 liters even on the day hikes.  
Tomorrow will be another day hike in Shenandoah.  We're pushing it a mile or mile and a half more than we did today.  Not as much elevation on the Awol pages were seen.  Tomorrow we end near Luray.

Above and Beyond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668597,"Yesterday worked well and today was a repeat but at a different location. Drive into park, drop off Janet and gear, drive to Panorama parking area at Skyline/US211, leave truck, take Honda back to Janet and start hiking.   
Today was not as cool as yesterday and we got on trail a few minutes after 8.  We passed many people on overlooks enjoying the morning sunrise.  There were also plenty of deer on skyline this morning (saw another doe and fawn) and more cars than the day before, but it is a Saturday on a holiday weekend.  Trail was very dry and a local on trail confirmed they are under a water conservation notice. Not as many hikers as I would have thought.  We did pass a group of older day hikers just before lunch.  I got the impression they were guided.  Only one through hiker we spoke to, Bear Claw.  He's a 20 something SOBO that started in July on Katahdin.  He's from Baltimore and moving along pretty well to be here in 2 months especially with all the crap he hiked through in July up north.
Now, AWOL made today look a lot like yesterday if not easier with lesser elevation gains.  It sure didn't feel like it.  Arriving at Elkwallow for lunch about 10:50am, we had already clocked in 6 miles.  Assuming only 8 and some change to go, the first 3 hours were relatively easy, even with Hogback mountain's climb.  There were some views and the trail was well maintained in most areas.
The afternoon heated up and the long assent less than a mile from lunch foretold of what was to come.  THe next few climbs started to take its toll on me.  Calves started to tight and threatened to cramp.  Feet were feeling it as well.  Janet and I have taken to stopping every mile to drink, stretch and try to workout the kinks in the legs.  I am glad we did as I can't imagine how achy I would have been at then end of today if I didn't.  It felt quite warm as the afternoon progressed.  
It was about 3:45pm when arrived tired and hot at the truck.  We drove the 14 miles back to get the motorcycle, stopped at the grocery and finally made it home at 6pm. Rather tired and needing a beer. 
Tomorrow is a zero day as we have to move the trailer to a new spot and Monday we return to slack packing due to near 100 degree weather in Virginia.

Above and Beyond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668634,"""Maybe someday, saved by zero, I'll be more together""Zero day today.   Used the day off to move the trailer, all be it 300 feet to a new spot, and planned the next week. Even had an opportunity to take a dip in the Shenandoah River.  The pic is Janet and I on the riverbank. Due to the temperature being really high and water resources on trail, we have opted to slack pack 2 more days and then do 3 days with 2 nights on trail.  Those nights on trail will get us to a shelter with water and a campground with, wait for it... SHOWERS!  It's the little things in life that make me smile.  Tomorrow we start back near Luray where 211 crosses Skyline hiking our way to a parking lot near Rock Springs Hut.  14.5 miles and the earlier we get moving the better.  It will be near 100 in the mid afternoon. Lunches and water are packed, motorcycle loaded and I have a bruised knee cap I am tending to.  Feels ok to walk, but transition to standing hurts like hell.  I think kneeling down on pavement every day for the last 3 caused it.Down the trail tomorrow we go...","

Above and Beyond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668711,"I was dreading today...We managed to get and early start.  On trail at 7:45 am, our earliest so far on this trip.  Total hiking time, with a 20 min lunch was just a few minutes under 8 hours.  We missed a turn and made our way to Mary's peak, adding about .2 miles to the Awol total.  It was an amazing view and well worth the 1.75 mile uphill and slight detour if you ever get the chance.Back to the title of this entry...My knee was hurting a lot.  I went to bed in pain dreading not making this hike.  I didn't want to feel like a failure and luckily I didn't.  Pain subsided a few hours before I woke and managed to stay hidden and we hiked.  The trail was nice and we had a breeze most of the day.  It was hot and dry also natural flowing water was non existent on trail.  The parks and picnic areas had fountains and refill spots.  So, that was good to see, even though we carried about 3 to 3.5 liters each.  Back to the trail.  This was a nice hike, although long.  We had lunch at mile 9 just past Skyland campground.  Shenandoah never fails when it comes to the scenery.  Lots of overlooks and lots of deer and other animals in this park.  Today had a lot of people on trail day hiking.  One guy, near Skyland, was hiking barefooted - who the heck knows why.  Off trail and on the way home we made it to the brewery in Luray.  Beer was great and we ordered pizza from a local place that really hit the spot.  By the time I got home I was worn out and ready for rest as tomorrow we plan a 13.5 mile day.","Mary's Rock trailhead parking (1250.9 SOBO)

Above and Beyond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668758,"Knowing it would be a hot one, we planned a mile or two shorter today than yesterday and got a early start again.  These early starts have proved very useful as we can get in as much hiking done while temps are below 80-85 degrees.  Drive from end of trail to Janet was only about 11-12 miles on the motorcycle and the round trip went a little faster.  On the drive to drop off the truck I passed Big Meadows.  Wow, it was beautiful,open and treeless, literally a big meadow.  Deer were everywhere, bucks in small groups and does and yearlings scattered along the road.  The largest group must have had a dozen.  I passed a few on the motorcycle ride back and luckily none were standing in the road like one proving the anti-lock brakes in the truck work really well.First few miles went easy and quickly.  We saw a lot of deer this morning on the hike. I think I counted 7.  One was just hanging around next to the trail and watched us walk by not 20 feet away.  Not much in the line of views and unfortunately the AT loops the north side of Big Meadows so hikers miss out on all the beauty there is to see.  bummer...Lunch at 11:15 had us at 7.6 miles in according to the watch.  We ate atop Hazel Mountain where not far from the pic of Janet and the hornet's nest.  As far as the terrain goes, the mile or two before Hazel and the remainder of the trail qualify as just plain boring.  Dry trail, weeds that are dying from lack of water and not much for those last 5 miles.  This is when Janet came up with a great idea.Today's shorter mileage was a time accommodation to give us time to pack for 2 nights and 3 days on trail.  As Janet pointed out, we're missing out on seeing things in the are and I commented, the drive through Big Meadows is far better than hiking around it.  So plans changed on trail that we take tomorrow off - both of our feet were feeling the hike - head into DC on Thursday and decided where we want to go next.  Back to Massachusetts and tour some places, hike more interesting stretches of Virginia, move the trailer into the park so we can day hike the remaining 3 or 4 days of Shenandoah without the 70 minute drive from where we are.  Hey, we're retired. We know the AT won't be completed this year.  Trail will still be there and as I mused to myself near the end of the hike; 'rocks, trees, bugs... I can do this in Louisiana and have the same lack of thrill...'I do want to complete Shenandoah and our plans so far seem to fit that.  Well, if I don't, there's more important things in life to do and experience.","
