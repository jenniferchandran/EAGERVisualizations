Swampfox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659737,"Hello everyone, I am James McKenzie, but I will be using the trail name of Swampfox. Swampfox was a name given to me by a friend many years ago and refers to my home growing up in SC and the association of the area with Francis Marion known as the ""Swamp Fox"" for his manner of fighting in the Revolutionary War. I have always liked this name and am very happy to carry it on the AT. 
 I have been interested in walking the AT for some time now, inspired by the challenge and the curiosity of if I had the ability to work through the struggles both physical and mental to accomplish the task. I retired in August of 2021 after nearly 30 years in Air Traffic Control for the military and quickly became bored but happened to listen to the book ""AWOL on the Appalachian Trail"" and became inspired again to get out on the AT. I even went so far as to drive to Harpers Ferry and go to the Conservancy. My desire waned a bit after, and I took a job as a firefighter only to be injured and require surgery which I am still recovering from now. 
 My recovery once again gave me time to evaluate on what I really should be doing and how important is it to work and make money if you really have what you need already. Additionally, I have experienced the loss of several friends over the past few years, and it came to me that I should reprioritize and focus on experiencing life instead of money. You see the friends lost never made it to where I am, being retired and able to do something they wanted to do instead of something they had to do. It is for those reasons that I have decided to attempt a Flip-Flop Thru Hike this coming year, 2023, if I can be ready by April 16 my registered departure day. 
 I hope this hike can be a tribute to those friends lost many military friends and firefighters who did not make it to the trail being called away far too early. I will try to visit as many Fire Departments along the way as possible since I am a firefighter and appreciate the dedication it takes to volunteer your time in many cases for others and the courage it takes to risk your life so a stranger could live. The Flip-Flop was picked for two reasons one being to ensure a completed hike but the other relates to the Fire Service. In picking the Flip-Flop my hike will end twice at the Fire House used by John Brown in Harpers Ferry. I can think of no better place to finish than crossing the river to sit in front of the historic station. 
 I will be attempting to vlog and blog the hike as much as possible and post the videos here and on some other platforms. I hope you follow along and hopefully you will be entertained or inspired to attempt something you maybe have thought of in the past.
 See you on the trail.",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Thu",0
Swampfox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659759,"Hi Again EveryoneToday was a gym day and I went and hit the weights as hard I could with the shoulder still in recovery. I have been working off a book designed for outdoor athletes which has been good so far. There is specific information for hiking and I have been diligent in getting the workouts complete and beyond. I am a bit skeptical of the portions in the specific are of hiking or walking most of which I have done on the treadmill so far. I guess they are fine just shorter than I would expect. I am training to hike 15 miles a day but most programs I have seen incorporate much less hiking or walking. We will see how it goes.Now how about that gear? I have been pouring over gear for days and days checking prices and taking down weights along with watching reviews. This is a daunting task for sure there are so many choices and so many recommendations its hard to determine what the right way to go really is. I have acquired my pack, Osprey Atmos AG 50, along with my sleeping pad. I am trying to get as far below 35lb as possible but until I have everything it will be hard to pin down the actual weight.It also became a little more real the idea that this is actually happening when my wife say ""We need to work out these details"". I plan to do the Flip Flop and she wasn't to excited to drive all the way to Maine. Im sure we will get it together and it will be fine. If not it may turn into a 2024 start I guess. Swampfox",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Thu",0
Swampfox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659785,"Yesterday was a hike day in the training program and it turned out to be an interesting day for sure. I started out thinking about putting it off till today but weather conditions helped me get going yesterday which was warmer and not as wet. The scheduled hike was to be just 6-8 miles with 20lb pack a light day but the first day of my plan with a real outside hike. Decision to go made I got to looking through my previously acquired search and rescue gear for the appropriate socks, layers, and other gear to get this done. I found I had already purchased Darn Though socks and Under Armor leggings so two very important areas should be protected for sure. I used a poly quick dry shirt I already had as well under a cotton long sleeve shirt and my TruSpec pants with leggings all seemed ready to go and comfortable. My pack is a small day pack a Teton I use just for weight which has no frame but is distributed well with the 20lb. All geared up and ready to get moving I felt good.I stepped out the door into the mid 30 temperature ready for 8 miles of moving feeling warm and comfortable but not too warm. The hike started out great no friction the UnderArmor doing its job fantastically. My pace was sitting at between 16 and 17 minutes per mile but very comfortable. I worked my way around town making sure to walk on the grass as much as possible because the sidewalk and the Brooks Cascadia don't seem to go together very well. The Darn Tough socks and the shoes, however, was a very effective combination. I have had knee pains before but there were no such problems so far on this hike.I maintained my pace to the halfway point with no discomfort and hit my 4 mile turn point feeling just the slightest feeling like my leggings needed to be pulled up. I was able to get a little pull and the feeling went away for the moment. It was at about the 5 mile point the weight of the pack seemed to just melt away like it wasn't there at all that was a great feeling. I had little in the way of back pain I think because I was focused on keeping my posture correct. My pace dropped a bit towards the end to between 17 and 18 not much of a drop but a little. The need to pull the leggings kept coming back but no feeling of burning or chaffing at all while moving. I was able to wrap up the entire hike in 2 hours 15 minutes maintaining a sub 17 minute pace which was great. I get back home and felt fantastic no pain just feeling like I walked 8 miles nothing unusual. It was at the shower I discovered the chaff was real. Apparently the feeling of leggings needing to be pulled up was the chaff happening. The burn was pretty good but cleared to tolerable over night. What I discovered in this hike is I need to address the chaffing by product or weight reduction one or both. I thought the Leggings would prevent chaffing but I was wrong secondary to the thighs was the nipple which was probably a mile from needing attention. In terms of feet I had no problems, no real hot spots no pain on completion of the hike. I think the socks are right on and the shoes as well but I do have Altra Olympus 5 coming this week to give a try. The rest of the day involved a lot of airing to reduce the pain and encourage the healing. I continue to work to get things right to prevent issues on the trail.",,View Entry,"Jan 08, Sun",0
Swampfox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659793,Well the plan changed today in terms of the Hike this year. It has become apparent that this is not a good time to set out for months on end. My wife is expanding her business and will need some help with getting everything in line and keeping the house up so that means a delay until 2024 for a possible thru or Flip-Flop hike. I will continue to update and make hikes to prepare but they are more likely to be sections this year. I hate to put it off but better to get the business in good order and go next year.,,View Entry,"Jan 09, Mon",0
Swampfox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659931,"Its been a couple of weeks since my last post and I have done a few things since then. First off I finally got in my shoes which are the Brooks Cascadia 16. These are great shoes I have been running in brooks for years and the trail runner is fantastic. I have been continuing my workouts and also added some others meaning additional workouts. It has beat me up for sure. While I write this I am totally drained and am hoping the energy returns soon. 


I have a couple of hikes or training sessions and the first was at a local park and lake, Harris Park, which I worked at for a short period. The park has a 5 mile trail that borders the lake along the peninsula with several ups and downs along the way. The trail is not very difficult but if walked quickly with a park a good workout is possible. This particular hike was the first in my new shoes and chaffing reduction set up. I used my toe foot liners and darn tough socks and experiences no problems at all. In terms of chaffing the under armor and body glide did the trick 100% pain free. I will have to admit it was a short trip only about a 5 miler so possibly not far enough for a real test but I was very happy with the result compared to the last hike.


The second hike was this weekend and was a bit further at the 8 mile mark. I was on the American Tobacco Trail a part of the Harris Park property and is generally flat for about 22 miles of old rail line. I set out with my same set up of clothing and shoes finding they all worked perfectly yet again. The problem this time was the pants which were Tru Spec 24-7, probably not the best choice but what I have been working with so far. I had just the most minimal of burn on the pad of my left foot but no real problems. I was able to average between 17-18 a mile which seems quick but I'm happy with the pace.


I don't plan to attempt the full thru hike of the AT this year but I am trying to work as if I were. The thing I am realizing is this is no joke its the simplest thing to walk it would seem, I mean, you just put one foot in front of the other but add 20lb and a few miles plus weather conditions and it becomes a very difficult thing indeed. I want to get the physical difficulty past me and it just be a mental challenge. I don't like when a thing is difficult physically because to me that is a simple thing to fix you just work. I feel old when I cant meet a physical challenge I will beat that if I am able. 
I will have some additional hikes soon and continue to train as much as possible, see you in the woods.",,View Entry,"Jan 22, Sun",0
