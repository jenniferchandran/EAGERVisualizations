Shawn S.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661408,"First, the Disclaimer: I am capturing my trail experiences more for family and friends who want to know what I'm up to and/or don't know much about the AT but would like to know. I realize that anything I post may be consumed by more experienced hikers with different experiences, so I ask that any comments made are please kept to a helpful and friendly disposition.

Now with that out of the way...

Less than two weeks to go before the adventure begins. Excited, nervous, anxious, are just several emotions that I am feeling. But first...

The Backstory:

Interestingly, I believe the seed was originally planted sometime in 2015 while talking about the Pacific Crest Trail with another Scout parent from the Boy Scout Troop I was associated with while living in Washington State. She mentioned how she had watched this video titled ‚ÄúDo More With Less | A Conversation About the Pacific Crest Trail‚Äù and how awesome that would be to attempt a hike from Mexico to Canada, taking in all the mountainous views and experiences along the way. I had never thought about hiking the Appalachian Trail. In fact, I don't think I even knew about it. But the PCT sounded awesome.

As it was, the timing was just not right for making any attempts at hiking the PCT. At that time, I was still in the military, raising my family and was about to be relocated to the east coast. Moving the clock forward, I have resided in the DC/MD/VA area for almost eight years, the kids have grown, and my wife is tired of hearing me talk about the AT, PCT, and CDT.

I have done various hikes in the area as well as other locations, some of which have been section hikes on the AT - but never anything for such a long duration and distance. Like many other thru hikers/aspiring thru hikers, I've watched many hiking videos of Dixie, Bigfoot, and Darwin just to name a few (if you're not sure who those names are, just Google/YouTube them along with ""thru hiking""). Maybe it was the feelings of wash/rinse/repeat of work, but over time I developed a need to challenge myself both physically and mentally ‚Äì hiking the AT could satisfy that itch.

I've seen enough friends, family, or work associates develop serious health issues, or at worse, lose their life to some sort of illness. We only get one chance at life and I don‚Äôt want to look back and say ‚Äúwell, I should have done _____.‚Äù Besides, are you really going to look back at your life and remember the meeting you sat in, or the time-critical project you had to work late for? Chances are, you're going to remember the moments where you did something new and exciting.

Sorry, for those who don't know the trail routes can change in length each year due to various reasons ‚Äì such as fire closures, damaged trails, or other unforeseen reasons:

Appalachian Trail (AT) ~ 2198 miles

Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) ~ 2650 miles

Continental Divide Trail (CDT) ~ 3100 miles

Oh, and the video that I mentioned about the Pacific Crest Trail can be found by going to this site:

Anyway, that's all for this post.

Shawn S.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661409,"In my last journal entry I didn‚Äôt mention the fact that without the blessing of my beautiful wife, I don‚Äôt think I would be taking the leap and doing this hike. It‚Äôs one thing to have goals and desires, but it‚Äôs another thing when you‚Äôre up and leaving your spouse of 30+ years for a period of 4 ‚Äì 6 months and transferring all your responsibilities onto that person‚Äôs plate. Not to mention just leaving your counterpart to do something that some may consider crazy and/or selfish. I can‚Äôt be more thankful and lucky to have an understanding and supportive spouse like her ‚Äì for that I want to say Thank You Saundra! You are remarkable in so many ways.

From my last post, I thought I‚Äôd include the links to several other sources of information if anyone wanted to explore more about the AT, PCT, and CDT.

Shawn S.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661440,"Let‚Äôs talk gear. What am I bringing on trail (at least, what am I starting out with)? I guess this site allows you to enter all your data, however, I already did that on ‚ÄúLighterPack‚Äù. Here‚Äôs the link to my gear list: https://lighterpack.com/r/88a3yd
I haven‚Äôt weighed my pack with food and water just yet but I‚Äôm close to that final product. It‚Äôs amazing that the lighter you go, so does your wallet. If you want to save pounds, ounces, grams, you have to pay more for lighter gear. I guess other ways to shave weight would be to cut back on luxury items ‚Äì and when I say ‚Äúluxury‚Äù I‚Äôm talking about items like camp shoes, a journal, sunglasses, things that you can do without but may be nice to have. Also, some may question why I‚Äôm bringing a bear canister. It‚Äôs true you don‚Äôt need one on most of the AT and for the few sections that do require a canister, you could technically hike through those sections. The canister weighs more and takes up more space. But, I‚Äôm trying to take the perspective of better stewardship of the environment and safety of the bears. Yes, it sucks carrying that weight ‚Äì and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll probably be singing a different tune after several hundred miles of shuttling that thing, but if more people would be responsible with their food and trash, there wouldn‚Äôt be a need for bear canisters. Every time we introduce food into an environment that isn‚Äôt our own, we invite the wildlife within that environment to partake in our food. When bears get used to seeing food in areas where humans would like to recreate, they‚Äôre more prone to try to get that food. And I think we all know what happens to a bear if they come in contact with humans‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the end of that bear.
Trust me, I‚Äôd rather ditch the canister and use a bag for my food, but if I can manage my gear appropriately, it may not be a big deal to carry the dang thing. Right now, I might have accomplished that goal.",,View Entry,"Mar 31, Fri",0
Shawn S.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661857,"Well the day has arrived. My lovely wife just dropped me off at Union Station in D.C.
My nerves have been going at top speed all week. A lot of last minute things to do around the house and then finally getting everything packed up.
Two weight measurements for the record:
1) My pack weight = 28.6lbs (includes water and food for four days); and¬†
2) My personal weight = 191.6lbs as of this morning.
I mention this because if anyone wants to take bets as to what those two weights will be when I finish, now you have a baseline.
Another item I should mention is that I‚Äôm not doing this trip alone. A good friend, James Barr is accompanying me on this journey.
Okay, train departs in 30 minutes. Gotta go. Next stop (tomorrow morning) will be Gainesville, GA!

Shawn S.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662069,"Arrived (after a completely sleepless night on the train) in Gainesville, GA at 7:30am. James arranged a pickup to get us to Amicalola Falls State Park.

Bob, the Ranger, provided an excellent overview of the trail as it goes through Georgia. He also explained some important information about several recent cases of Norovirus and giardia near the shelters.
After the brief we headed over to take our photos under the arch. The next major decision was how to get to the lodge for breakfast before they closed. We decided to skip the waterfall staircase and hike a different path - both are equally painful and end at the same point.
We got to the restaurant with 15 minutes to spare. After enjoying a delicious buffet breakfast (highly recommended) and much needed coffee, it was time to get going.
I hiked the 8.8 miles to the start of the Appalachian Trail on top of Springer¬†¬†Mountain. The weather was absolutely perfect, temperatures in the low 70‚Äôs and a slight breeze. The approach trail was brutal, especially after not having any rest for more than 24 hours.
Fortunately, Springer Mountain Shelter was only .2 miles from the trailhead. So, even though my mileage on this site shows .2 miles it‚Äôs actually 9 miles for the day.
Set up the tent and called it the day.","Amicalola Falls State Park

Shawn S.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662075,"Got a little bit of sleep last night. Woke up made breakfast broke camp and hit the trail.
Today was a much easier day hiking than yesterday. Started at an elevation of 3697 feet. The hike for the next four miles was a gradual descent to Three Forks.

For about the next four miles it was a steady climb to Hawk Mountain Shelter where I stayed for the night.
I think I counted 14 tents in the campsite that evening. Met a couple who were hiking with their dog, which was an Australian shepherd/Collie mix. She was very energetic - wish I had that energy.
I heard from another hiker that there was some pretty bad weather coming in so with that in mind, decided to make reservations at Above the Clouds hostel for the next night. Luckily, they had space available in one of their cabins. With that in mind, I went to sleep around 8 PM dead tired.","Springer Mountain Shelter

Shawn S.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662079,"Today started off great. The weather was really good and the terrain was easier to hike. There were plenty of elevation changes, but today‚Äôs challenge was to get over Mount Sassafras and get to Woody Gap where we would be picked up and shuttled to Above the Clouds Hostel.The rain that was forecasted for later at night came in much earlier during the day around 2:30 PM. Along with the rain came high winds and chillier temperatures.
When I reached Woody Gap and took my pack off, my right shoulder was hurting big time. I thought I might be in trouble because I had a hard time raising my right arm above my head.¬†
Achilles (one of the workers at the hostel) came and picked us up and brought us back to the hostel where we settled in and got an overview of the facility.
At the hostel, they provided a clean change of clothes to wear while they did your laundry. There was also food available to eat or snack on and food to resupply for the trail if necessary.
My shoulder hurt pretty bad and I was deeply concerned as to whether to continue my hike or bale. Luckily after talking to my wife, she said that maybe I just need to ice my shoulder and get some rest. I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt think of that but it turned out that icing it helped tremendously. I guess I was too busy freaking out about having to depart the trail so soon that I didn‚Äôt consider the obvious. That‚Äôs just one of the million reasons I love my wife. I‚Äôm a train wreck without her.
After getting a hot shower and eating a full pizza, along with Cheetos and a beer and some aspirin, I settled in and called it quits for the night.
I‚Äôll wait to see what tomorrow brings.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Shawn S.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662481,"Woke up this morning and my shoulder did not hurt nearly as bad as the night before. Made the decision to continue hiking, but to take it easy. Decided to make a reservation at the Hidden Pond Hostel and see how things were at the end of the day.
The hostel was run by Lost Johnny and Rainbow. It was a nice little house that had a separate section for hikers, and they also had tent sites. There were no indoor spaces available so we booked the tent sites which were cheaper anyway. At the hostel, we had some beers, a burrito and pizza for dinner. Also, I did laundry, recharged my devices, and relaxed.","Woody Gap

Shawn S.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662482,"Woke up this morning and enjoyed a nice continental breakfast. Lost Johnny shuttled us back to Jerrard Gap where we continued our hike.

Today‚Äôs challenge was to hike blood mountain. The hike from the southside up was a bit tough, but had some switchbacks that made it a little less daunting.
At the top, there was a nice shelter with some magnificent views. The trip down was a different story. There was a lot of rock maneuvering, and the temperatures were increasing. Additionally, since this was on a weekend, there were plenty of other visitors hiking up from the side that I was coming down from.
Next stop along the trail was Neels Gap. This turned out to be an interesting stop. There were a bunch of tents set up, and I thought that there might be food available, however, there was a physical therapy school providing free therapeutic sessions.
I told them about my recent shoulder surgery, and the fact that I was doing physical therapy prior to my hike, and they were more than eager to get all of their students a chance to try learning correct therapy procedures. Essentially I was a guinea pig for the class.
Also, at Neels Gap is Mountain Crossings, a full service outfitter. They had a ton of good hiking equipment available as well as hiking food and other sorts of supplies. I bought a few food items. After¬†that I got back on the trail and continued hiking.
Decided to stay at a campsite at Baggs Creek Gap - apparently so did a whole bunch of other hikers. We were all crammed in there.","Jarrard Gap

Shawn S.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662483,"Today was going to be a boring day with nothing special planned. The original intent was to hike to Low Gap Shelter. However, when I got there, there was a older gentleman who looked to be homeless, and he was talking with another hiker.
I met up with Dale, who was another hiker that I had been seeing along the trail, and he told me that while he was there refilling his water, he overheard some of the conversations of the homeless looking person. Essentially, we didn‚Äôt feel comfortable spending the night there. About two days prior someone stole a bunch of hikers food bags at Gooch Mountain Shelter. One of the Trail Runners mentioned that there was a homeless person on the trail who poses as a thru hiker has been thought to be stealing peoples items. We figured that the person at Low Gap Shelter may have been the guy. So we all decided to move on and stay at the next campsite further down.
We ended up at Poplar Stamp Gap tent site, and settled in for the evening.","Baggs Creek Gap

Shawn S.,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662485,"Got a shuttle ride from Bitcoin into the town of Helen.¬†
Bitcoin was an interesting person. He is a retired attorney who worked with movie production companies, such as Miramax and Lucas films handling intellectual property and trademark matters. He also worked for Robert DeNiro. Bitcoin said that he and another person are camping in a trailer along the Appalachian Trail providing shuttle services and trail magic. We will probably run into him again along the trail.
We asked Bitcoin his recommendations on where to stay and eat. He recommended that we stay at the Helendorf River Inn so we decided to take his recommendation and spend the night.
While doing our laundry, we headed over to Wendy‚Äôs for a late lunch. After lunch and taking care of chores, we decided to hit the town and have dinner at Cowboys and Angels.The town of Helen is pretty neat. It‚Äôs a small German town with shops and restaurants. If there was more time, it would be fun to explore a little more.","Poplar Stamp Gap
