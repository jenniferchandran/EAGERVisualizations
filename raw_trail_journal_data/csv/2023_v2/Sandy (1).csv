Sandy ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662041,"It‚Äôs been a long day, by the time I sat down to write this at 6:16pm I was TIRED. I had an early flight from EWR today (yes I know, why not one of the 2 conveniently close airports 20 min away from me? The motivations of past Sandy are a mystery, lost to the sands of time) so I had the classic experience of ‚Äúintermittently waking up through the night in fear of missing the flight.‚Äù This was compounded by the need to wake up 2 hours to departure to finish packing (I had only finished packing up my flat yesterday). Thankfully Mom had a cuppa tea waiting for me, which fueled my frantic shoving everything into a cardboard box.
We drove to Newark in that beautiful quiet, clear, warm, wintry dawn light that I love. I unfortunately drew the worst seat possible which was middle seat last row, but I was so tired I fell asleep twice on the flight. Arriving into Atlanta was supremely bumpy, think I‚Äôd rather walk home than fly back¬†ü§£.¬†


I got to hotel, checked in, exploded my box to quickly check if anything got damaged in flight, and then walked to REI and Walmart to get last minute shopping in. I was staring at the Smartwater display in Walmart, and it intensely felt like I was the trainer at beginning of a Pok√©mon game where you have to choose your starter - the Smartwater bottle is such a critical piece of gear and could be lasting me for the whole trip. Or at least a month, I‚Äôm not that gross. I also searched vainly for the dried refried beans to make Skurka‚Äôs legendary beans and rice - the thru hikers ahead of me must have cleaned them out. Other concessions to the thru hikers were the staggering walls of blister and wound care in the pharmacy section. Hours of contemplating bandages later, I returned to the hotel and repackaged food to shove it all in my bear can. Unfortunately my pack is quite tall due to a) the unstretchy nature of the fabric and b) the bulkiness of the bear can. I don‚Äôt want to look like a knob rolling with a tall pack but I need to remember there‚Äôs no ego in this and it‚Äôs not a competition (lol if you know me as a person).¬†


I struggled to stay away for Succession and then passed out. Tomorrow is the big day!! Long way from 7/18/22 when I registered for this bad boy.¬†


!!Bonus Literature Corner!!
Reading Seven Pillars of Wisdom, and 2 thoughts so far:
1. At a staggering 12.3 oz I will be ripping pages out as I read in order to reduce the weight because this is heavier than my tent
2. I was maybe all of 5 pages in before TE Lawrence felt the need to inform the reader that the desert‚Äôs ‚Äúpublic women‚Äù weren‚Äôt to the taste of the English boys so they turned to each other but somehow it was ‚Äúpure and sexless‚Äù!! Sure. This of course made me turn to Google for more, where I was spoiled that later Lawrence gets captured by a bey (not ~the Bey~), and is tortured after rejecting him - which then gives Lawrence a taste for masochism and has his friends whip him for an imaginary master. There‚Äôs a lot more to this, but beyond the purview of a public journal lol).",,View Entry,"Apr 09, Sun",0
Sandy ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662052,"It was a hot mess packing my pack today, I could not get it to roll at all and after the third time repacking I was already sweating without having even stepped a single foot on the trail! At that point I thought, ‚Äúah just fuck it you‚Äôll get the hang of rolling it on the trail,‚Äù and hustled my ass out of there to meet the shuttle driver, Ron, who is very sweet and gave me a fantastic first 5 day itinerary.


I got dropped off at the makeshift visitor‚Äôs center to register - I am hiker number 2420 ([white] blaze it) and weigh my pack (28.53lb with 5 days‚Äô food and no water, not terrible). After orientation I was off!


It was cool but was warm when walking through the sunbeams - I can smell the first wafts of summer coming in from further south. The stairs at the falls were bad as expected, but not as terrible as hyped up on the internet lol. I find long, gradual inclines more annoying than something I can sprint up (chanting rowing calls in my head while doing so). I noticed that the trail itself is very sparkly in the sunlight due to crushed mica, how very¬†Edward Cullen of it.


I passed the official Southern Terminus on Springer Mountain (yes today was merely the 8.8 mile approach trail that does not count towards the 2,198 miles of AT) and rolled into camp at 3:30pm. I was extremely thirsty so chugged 2+L so I don‚Äôt pass out again, as my handy Harry Potter scar reminds me. The whole day I was thinking of the beef stroganoff dinner I had packed and it was as delightful as I wanted it to be. Devoured that and a cuppa. I chatted with Will, George, Margaret, and Firecracker (and her adorable dog Griffey) at camp. I was surprised how relatively few folks were camped at the first shelter since I thought I was still in the bubble, but it was a nice ease in and after dinner I built a fire with Margaret and Firecracker, which was lovely. There‚Äôs something satisfying on the primal level about gathering around a fire as darkness falls and the chill creeps in.¬†


I‚Äôd give today 10/10, it was hard but exciting and rewarding. I slept pretty well with 7+ hours in total, and got some amazing views of the stars during my nighttime bathroom breaks.¬†Reminded me of camping up high in Peru and being overwhelmed by the stars at night for their unfamiliarity, cold brilliance, and feeling of suffocation as they were pressing down upon us in the mountain. Space!!!!","Amicalola Falls State Park
",Springer Mountain Shelter,"Apr 10, Mon",9
Sandy ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662054,"A good night‚Äôs sleep, pretty sunrise, a dank protein chocolate chip oatmeal, and tea makes for a great start to the day. Will and George rolled out early in efforts to have more mileage, but Margaret and Firecracker kindly stayed back to help me troubleshoot if I could pack my pack down smaller. Today I got the top to roll 1-2x and attach the compression straps (did not have space to tighten alas)! Better than yesterday which was no roll, no compression strap LOL. One day at a time - stay tuned to this saga which, while may not be thrilling to you, is actually something occupying a lot of my headspace so far.¬†


Walking I was feeling great, only sore in my shoulders and not in knees / feet at all except for my pinky toes starting to become hotspots due to the Hokas being too narrow to accommodate my orthotics and double socks. I must baby them for the next few days until Neels Gap where I can swap for a pair of 11W or 11.5 shoes for more room. Yes I have flippers for feet. It‚Äôs fine - very stable footing! I also hope to make a big dent in my book so I can tear out a ton of pages and cut weight.¬†


Yesterday during strategy Ron told me that today was the vacation day, so I decided to take it easy with the leisurely breakfast, and left at 9:45am. Hike was good excluding feet hotspot, but felt strong carrying the pack. I leapfrogged Margaret / Firecracker / Griffey and I stopped at Stover Creek for some body maintenance. The ladies rolled in while I was there and I got to chat with them and met Won‚Äôt Get Up Will who rolled in, and is doing her THIRD thru hike since 2019. Dang.


Post tuneup, I rolled on and blue blazed (side trail not part of official AT, white blaze is official AT) to Lost Creek Falls which Ron and Firecracker recommended. It was lovely!!! Prettier than Amicalola Falls, because at the very least I could actually appreciate it unlike the other where I was just focused on chugging up the stairs. I sat for half an hour watching the pattern of the water racing over the falls, and with Firecracker¬†and WGUW‚Äôs encouragement screwed up the courage to take a dip in it. It was COLD but felt so refreshing, my feet were happy as a clam and it felt nice washing the salts off. (My research yielded that a common thruhiker regret was not taking every chance to swim so I wanted to set the tone right).¬†


Margaret and Firecracker / Griffey were only overnighting to Three Corners / the falls, so that was the last I‚Äôll probably see of them - but they were so sweet and really helpful fonts of knowledge.


I trudged the last 2 miles, leapfrogging WGUW, and rolled into the campsite at 3:30pm. Set up camp, chatted with folks, and made coconut chicken curry for dinner. After the wash up I crawled into my tent to read my book and rest up for tomorrow which is supposed to be tough - 7 miles without water and going up Sassafras. But after that all downhill and water to be found.¬†


!!Literature Corner!!
British senior official on a warship finds the ordinary seamen poor conversation, plops into a sumptuous armchair and engages the other armchair‚Äôs occupant with a conversation about Wagner in German / French / Arabic - which Lawrence wryly notes that ‚Äúthe ship‚Äôs officers found the whole conversation unnecessary‚Äù - making me almost spit out my tea at dinner.¬†


I would rate today 8.75/10 due to hotspots.","Springer Mountain Shelter
",Hawk Mountain Campsite,"Apr 11, Tue",7.20
Sandy ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662056,"I only woke up twice, at 11pm and 5am, at which point I decided to stay up for good. Had a nice breakfast of a weird s‚Äômores grits concoction, chatted with neighbors J13 and Flipper that I had met yesterday, and then shoved off by 9:15am. Getting a little faster leaving camp!


Today was Sassafras which I was warned was hard and dry, so I hauled 3L of water which was the toughest part in my opinion.¬†¬†A father son duo went by in matching orange, which was adorable. I chugged up and down Sassafras (calling power 30s in my head the whole time) in an hour, which is not bad! Especially with my ludicrously capacious bag. I prefer uphills as they feel safer on the knees than downhills, so am more confident steaming upwards. After that push was down to Cooper Gap where I saw the remnants of trail magic, some jugs of water left for hikers. I of course had a billion liters left so was fine. I continued onwards to Justus Creek, where I met some folks (including someone who apparently lives very near me back home! Small world). I took another dip to refresh and manage the hotspots. This was almost to camp, when I passed Devil‚Äôs Kitchen creek I noticed its superior swimming depth to Justus‚Äô and made a note to come back. I rolled into Gooch Gap camp at 2:30pm and tented when I heard someone say my name and it was WGUW! Huzzah! The folks I met at Justus Creek came in, as well as J13 / Flipper, and others I had passed through the day.


I felt strong at this point and could have pressed on past Gooch, but I‚Äôm sticking to my 8mpd rule for the first 10 days so I don‚Äôt blow up my body.¬†


Once I had set up and done my chores, I went back to Devil‚Äôs Kitchen to swim.


Post dip, I had dinner with the group which felt like being in the bubble for the first time. I learned a new game, Farkle, and got smoked at it by Joplin. I was HUNGRY today, and bonked during cooking and exploded my food and water everywhere. Don‚Äôt worry, I cleaned it up but was very annoying.¬†


Today was a 10/10.","Hawk Mountain Campsite
",Gooch Mountain Shelter,"Apr 12, Wed",8.30
Sandy ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662057,"In the night someone came to camp and stole bear bags from the bear boxes! That‚Äôs a travesty on trail, as that‚Äôs what folks carry their food in. This was the first anyone at the shelter, or that I spoke to today, had heard of that happening.¬†
Separately to the robbery, I was up during the night worried about the thunderstorms and my body as the pinky toe hotspot had turned into a blister so large it gained sentience. I was able to call and get a spot at Hidden Pond hostel to give my body some TLC and doctor that blister into oblivion. Plus shoes with a wider toebox!!Leaving the shelter I did an easy¬†c. 5 mile hike today and enjoyed the views. At Woody Gap I got picked up, and the hostel is just absolutely perfect. It‚Äôs a tranquil oasis and has everything you could need. Showering and laundry felt amazing, but then I felt the urge to get back on trail and keep going. But must ease in! Watch me give up on that next week and start crushing 14+ miles so I have less downtime in afternoons. I am extremely excited to go to¬†Mountain Crossing tomorrow and do a shakedown, get new shoes, and mail stuff home. I read some more, tore out more pages, and played some games with folks including What do you Meme - had the interesting experience of explaining memes to middle aged people, and seeing how they interpreted each picture versus what they are actually used for. Consider it an anthropological study.","Gooch Mountain Shelter
",Woody Gap,"Apr 13, Thu",4.80
Sandy ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662535,"This morning I went to the long awaited, promised land aka Mountain Crossing to do my gear shakedown / shoe swap to prevent future blister issues. There I ran into Proton and Metro, who I had last seen at Gooch Gap Shelter before I nero/zeroed out to address the blister crisis - while great to see them, it gave me the yearning to be back on the trail.
Elsewhere at the shop, I got to work: out went the Hokas and in came a pair of Topos with a wider toebox. More thrillingly was the gear shakedown, I was able to streamline my FAK, eliminate most paracord, take out the camera I panic-packed, and my lopsack (since I decided to commit to all my bear can - yes all 2 pounds of it). The funny comment of the shakedown was when I was sorting through my Dr Bronner‚Äôs and Dove soap and the person helping me commented that ‚ÄúI was more concerned with hygiene than the average thruhiker‚Äù - that got a laugh out of me.¬†


Returning to the hostel I ran into WGUW, who gave me a huge smile, hugged, and informed me that she shed 12 POUNDS of pack weight. Dang, I‚Äôd be smiling too at that point. The rest of the day I was rather antsy and eager to get back on trail, as my blister had resolved itself (cough with some strategic stabbing cough). While it was rainy, it wasn‚Äôt the epic thunderstorm I was hoping for to justify the zero. At least I was able to read / shred a good chunk of my book.¬†At this point what I long for most is vegetables. Visions of bell peppers were dancing in my head as I fell asleep and the shadow of scurvy crept across my soul.¬†


(While in the car today I was thinking about how beautiful the southern Appalachias are, especially wreathed in the morning mist and clouds moving through the mountains. It‚Äôs a very subtle, nuanced beauty versus the aggressive BALD ROCKS CRAG CLIFF of the West. If you appreciate biodiversity and seeing different color variations of the same species, this is the hike for you.)","Woody Gap
",Woody Gap,"Apr 14, Fri",0
Sandy ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662536,"Feeling accomplished! I was so glad to be back on trail, and with better shoes.¬†


I got dropped off at Woody Gap in the morning with another hostel guest, A. My plan was to get to Woods Hole shelter and see how I felt (trying to ease in and all that jazz, no ego in thruhiking, last one to Katahdin wins blah blah blah). I got there at noon, and as I snacked on a Sunkist Buffalo chicken creation I thought to myself: ‚Äúthis is way too early to break for the day‚Äù so I decided to go up and over Blood Mountain. Uphill was perfectly fine - Blood is the tallest mountain in GA and the views were nice but I was just so focused on making it downhill before the rain that I didn‚Äôt linger. Conversely, the downhill was a long 2 hour boring slog inching downward and avoiding the artificially-scented day hikers.¬†


At the bottom I checked if Mountain Crossing had room in the bunkhouse, and it did! So I had a shower for the THIRD day in the row, which was quite luxurious especially considering how hot the day was and this was my first double digit day. More crucially there was trail magic of FREE PHYSICAL THERAPY and it was absolutely amazing. They poked and prodded and examined me - I felt like a frog laid out for dissection in biology class.


Post moonlighting as a scientific experiment, I chatted with an Aussie and A¬†(now tentatively named Russet Potato) in front of the store and introduced myself to thruhikers passing by. My goal is to know everyone‚Äôs names within a 10-20 mile radius of my hike, but I‚Äôm pants at remembering names so we‚Äôll see how that goes. Trail names are so much easier to remember though, as they‚Äôre much wackier.¬†


Today was a 10/10
Hard but glad to be back in action!!! I also discovered the wonder that is lactose-free chocolate milk from Fairlife which has 23g of protein!! Smooth brain no thoughts. Might try 10-12 miles / day for next week and see how that goes.","Woody Gap
",Neels Gap,"Apr 15, Sat",10.80
Sandy ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662537,"I woke up at 7 and decided to just roll out without cooking breakfast, so I left by 7:36. I was concerned about rain and thunderstorms today but thankfully besides some very light sprinkles when walking in the fog, it was totally fine and cool, which made it pleasant for hiking.


I did a lot of ridge walking in the clouds blanketing the hilltops and it was lovely. It felt very PNW / Twilight (I‚Äôm a monster Bella!!!) and fun ecologically. I saw a snail, some funky black and yellow millipedes, and mushrooms. 
I passed the folks from the bunkhouse who left before me, and got to hike mostly in peace today which was super nice. I love socializing at shelters, but during the hike itself I like to not be neck and neck with someone so I don‚Äôt feel compelled to compete or hike at a different pace than I would prefer.¬†


I think I‚Äôve landed on the winning snack lineup for all day fuel. Carby breakfast bar like Nature Valley for first hour, then break after 4 hours for lunch of a Sunkist packet, and then snack on something afterwards to get me through 1-2 pm. I made really good progress and am feeling good with 2 double digit days in a row - still easing in!!


I rolled into Low Gap shelter and saw more friends from Gooch Gap that I had fell behind during my nero/zero! I caught up with them over what we had missed in the past few days, and then the folks from the bunkhouse rolled in (turns out it was someone‚Äôs birthday). Two folks I had met from the Hidden Pond hostel came in as well, and it was an interesting merging of days. The thing about thruhiking is that who you see on different days can vary so wildly based on hiking speeds, who takes a zero, weather, start dates, etc. that to see them all together is like seeing different friend groups merge.¬†


I was flying today, buoyed by the thoughts of eating vegetables and drinking kombucha tomorrow lolololol. I was unable to bribe the good hosteliers yesterday to eat their kale slaw so tomorrow will be exciting from a nutritional standpoint.


Today was 10/10!","Neels Gap
",Low Gap Shelter,"Apr 16, Sun",11.50
Sandy ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662539,"I was going to get off at Unicoi Gap into Hiawasee today, but Russet Potato egged me to push further so we could split a cabin with a group the next night. Which fine, I had missed the free shuttle into town and its hiker feed and thus had no more time crunch. I was feeling decent and decided to push to the next gap 2.7 miles further, and then do a slack pack day the next day in order to catch up to the group (what happened to no ego in thruhiking?).¬†


And you know what? My legs feel pulverized, trying out new shoes / sock configurations / PT-provided inserts at once was not the move and I got shin splints on the downhills. But thankfully I got off and shuttled to Around the Bend, where I ran into Proton and Metro again! They are very ahead of me (no ego in thruhiking no ego in thruhiking) but it was nice to see them for perhaps the last time before they leave me in the dust / get off when they finish their section. After showering I grabbed a shuttle to the grocery store, and I am not kidding I almost wept when I saw the fresh food.¬†


First things first, I had a delicious fried chicken from their hot bar, salad, and chugged a kombucha (that balances out right?). Once satiated I did my food shopping, and then had sesame chicken to reward myself while FaceTiming my mom to update her on my anthropological expedition to the Ingles store.¬†


When I got back I caught up on Succession (in the end‚Ä¶ no one got a kiss from daddy), and thought about how I would love to take a zero tomorrow but alas I am slackpacking. I‚Äôll nero the day after.


Sidebar, thrillingly I woke up at 1:41am and ate half a bag of Bugles, giving my tongue salt burns but oh so delicious. I was like a deer at a salt lick.","Low Gap Shelter
",Indian Grave Gap,"Apr 17, Mon",12.40
Sandy ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662551,"Today I slackpacked, trotting smartly over the hills. I was nervous about doing even more mileage when my the side of my left knee was fussy, but I‚Äôm glad I did as I felt I was able to stretch out whatever was the issue. Unclear if I‚Äôm any faster slack packing but it‚Äôs a hell of a lot easier. I packed out some blueberries to snack on while hiking, and gave some to Lyme Tyme when I passed him. You get one guess how he got his trail name, hint: he‚Äôs finishing his hike from last year.¬†


I got off at Dick‚Äôs Creek back to the hostel, but to the cabin this time which was a little further down the road and had a nice view of the hills. The group then went to town to resupply at Ingles and get dinner. I had called us the town taxi but thought he said he had a Silverado and when a silver Cadillac limo pulled up I thought ‚Äúsurely this can‚Äôt be it‚Äù and the taxi never called to confirm. Welp, it was our ride so we called him to come back.¬†We got dinner at Hiawasee Brewery, where I got the house burger (eh) and fries (decent but so insanely salty), and we sat slowly baking in the sunset which was this hazy, feverish pink sun. It was definitely a strange and surreal vibe, or maybe I was feeling introspective. When we got back to the cabin I sat outside watching the pink light wash over the hills listening to the Flaming Lips, which felt very apt for the mood I was in. While hiking I feel like solving a puzzle and I‚Äôm in the flow zone, and when not hiking I definitely get caught up in how much of an undertaking this is. My leg is still not feeling perfect, and may want to rest it some more - I haven‚Äôt needed to take ibuprofen yet, and trying to proactively stretch before anything becomes an issue.","Indian Grave Gap

Sandy ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662552,"Well, today was supposed to be a nero but ended up doing 9 miles. In my defense, I was very leisurely to get up and going this morning as I got on trail at 9:50 which is SO LATE for a hiker. However, a big breakthrough was made in packing my pack smaller as the shuttle driver pointed out how to better pack and compress the gear and now my pack is shorter than me when I‚Äôm wearing it!! It‚Äôs the little things in life - not that it made a big difference wearing it but I look MUCH less of a knob.¬†After 4 miles we took an hour lunch break where I wrangled Russet Potato into a pun competition, which probably made S regret hiking with me. Lunches are much longer with others, as hiking solo I struggle to make myself take my full union-mandated 30 minute lunch, as I like to call it.¬†Post lunch and my victory in punning, we did another 5 to cross the GA / NC border and cross the first state off our list! 1 down, 12 to go.","Dick‚Äôs Creek Gap

Guy on the trail when he heard someone walked off to pee: ‚Äúman, women aren‚Äôt worth it‚Äù


Today we were hiking and I noticed signs saying we were in a bear sanctuary, but thought nothing of it. There had been reports of bears stealing food at the shelters but we were staying at a campsite so thus less crowded / less likely bears would know food was there right? Hm‚Ä¶.


Hiking over Standing Indian mountain was like passing through another fairytale, but an unsanitized Hans Christian Andersen one with the sides falling rapidly away from us as we passed through naked, sun bleached bone white trees.¬†


We got to camp and got to know better Dance Party, Snackpack, and Crypt who we had been leapfrogging the past 2 days. The water source was ‚Äú0.10 miles away‚Äù but was more like 0.25-0.3 one-way but quite nice for a sponge bath, or in this case a shamwow bath. I sang lustily on my way there and back to deter any bears, but it would be fine right? They‚Äôre shy and fear human encounters right?


I went to do my last bathroom break before bed and was looking off into the distance and thought to myself ‚Äúhm that log kind of looks like a bear, ha ha it‚Äôs just pareidolia - oh that log just laid down it‚Äôs a bear HOLY FUCKING SHIT.‚Äù I had NEVER seen a bear in the wild before and to not have the barrier of ANYTHING between us almost made me weep in terror.

I slinked back into my tent and whispered for S, who groggily said ‚Äúyes?‚Äù and I whispered back ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a bear!!!‚Äù Alas S could not hear me, so I crawled out and went to his tent and said louder ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a bear!!‚Äù. That got his attention and he came out to look, and the bear looked at us looking at him, without a care in the world. He was laying down, clearly waiting for us to go to bed so he could take our food and be on his way, as if we were merely food delivery people leaving his takeout on his doorstep. The others heard our chatter and came out to look, and the bear decided to leave after hearing us but not fearfully.

S woke around 12 and heard a bear tearing into a bag, and ostensibly another one panting behind him. Sweet Potato (formerly known as Russet Potato) heard it too, but was waiting in his tent for someone else to screw up the courage to confront the bears. After 15 or so minutes S decided to go out, and Sweet Potato joined him. They somehow decided to pee to show dominance to the bear (lol) and act big and scary (S shouted ‚Äúhey fucker‚Äù). The bear grumbled off (after having shredded S‚Äôs bag and punctured Sweet Potato‚Äôs bag) and they went back to bed but could hear the bears circling the camp.
Me, the one who had spotted the first CHONKY bear last night? Happily asleep.¬†


In the morning we surveyed the damage: Sweet Potato‚Äôs stove was shredded and S‚Äôs snacks were sadly consumed. After a few minutes to duly mourn their loss and redivide food to last for the next 1.5 days (and some donations from the others at the campsites), we headed out. The hike itself was fairly nondescript and easy today until the STEEP AS FUCK CLIMB up Albert Mountain and to the fire tower (which reminded me of the watch platforms at Cape Canaveral). We rolled onwards into camp and had a dank multi-course dinner. Hopefully our food and camp stays unmolested tonight (this is! Our privacy square!).

We went to the sole Thai place in town for lunch and had pretty mediocre Thai food, and then walked to Ingles to resupply for our push to NOC.¬†


Friends I had met at Hostel Around the Bend texted asking if we had room to crash, as the weather was forecasted to be freezing that night so they somehow got a ride from where they were to meet us. As thanks they brought us a massive box of Cheez Its - perfect bribe!¬†


We ended having dinner with a large group of friends that had all rolled into Hilltop Inn independently, and got Mexican.

I stopped for lunch at Spence Field Shelter, and saw the Aussie (n√©e trail name Dotty) heading out! I hadn‚Äôt seen her in days so it was nice to say hi. I had lunch alone, knocking my poles together to keep the bears away, and eventually S and Sweet Potato came straggling along. (Sidebar, that shelter had the nicest privy on the trail BY FAR - with a little wooden moon in the door, fresh swept floor, buckets of mulch at the ready, and clean toilet lid. Amazing!!!)


I wasted a lot of time complaining to them about how wet my socks were, and then I finally squelched off into the now sunny, but still cool, afternoon. It was slower going, and tummy pains made me text Nikki to see if I had appendicitis. She kindly replied while on vacation to say no, but could be some other exciting thing - which I decided to ignore and the pain went away when my pack was off. Just probably indigestion from the thousands of snack bars I eat a day. While hiking I saw someone pass by SOBO with a kilt, and he was rocking the shit out of it. Think of all that airflow down under!


Finally made it to camp, set up my tent, and lo and behold it started snowing! It‚Äôs almost May!! This is exactly why I delayed my start a month, to avoid snow in the Smokies.

We actually left early and chugged along to Newfound Gap where we were able to hero into Gatlinburg (the biggest tourist trap ever).

After cleansing ourselves of our regrets, we had a delicious lunch (I had a dank corned beef Benedict and candied apples). Post devouring our huge plates we sat in silence for 2 minutes, and agreed that we weren‚Äôt full at all - guess the hiker hunger is kicking in. I would loved to have lingered!!!!! however S was on a mission to not let us get vortexed into staying in town overnight and marched us back out into the Smokies and the snow.¬†


Back at the gap we talked to some tourists about our thruhike (we felt like a zoo attraction with the way folks were goggling), and I ~liberated~ some hand sanitizer from the bathroom pump into my purell since I forgot to buy a new one in town. Post filching supplies, we chugged back up into the Smokies and our shelter for the night, where it snowed again!! For the third day in a row!! In May! We decided to not press on due to the forecast of winds above 50 mph and rolled in where we saw some friends we hadn‚Äôt seen in days!! As we arrived early in the day (maybe around 3:30 or 4?), we had a very leisurely time in camp and was able to hang out and make new friends - the vibe was also very festive as it was Woodstock‚Äôs birthday the next day. So of course this meant a fire to celebrate, and to ward off the snow. In efforts to have a better sleep than the past 2 nights, I split a tent with a friend to see if the two-punch of smaller space and shared body heat would keep us warm.

Finally dawn came, and with it S left as he was nervous about finishing before his wedding in mid-September.

As it was so cold I decided to have my creamy chicken ramen for breakfast to warm up, which alas is my ‚Äúleft behind ramen‚Äù as every time I have it I get slowed down eating it and am left behind. It indeed foretold me getting left behind today as I was slow as fuck getting out of camp; however I got a blue blaze recommendation from Woodstock and a clementine!¬†


Sweet Potato and I rolled out, and I detoured at Charlie‚Äôs Bunion which was a cool rock outcropping but I was too scared to climb up it so I merely peered over at the view. There were some day hikers who somehow had gotten there before me from Newfound Gap smug at getting there so early, to which I thought ‚Äòbuzz off.‚Äô But by the time I got back to the trail Sweet Potato was gone, and I thought to myself that I wouldn‚Äôt see either him or S until Hot Springs. I trudged along sleepily (due to the long night wrestling the tent pole) and rolled to lunch where I saw Sweet Potato at the shelter junction! What rapture, despite the ramen I was not to be left behind. For lunch I made a dank loaded oatmeal (oatmeal packets, whey protein, coconut flakes, cashews) and while eating our friend PBJ rolled by.


Much cheered now that I wasn‚Äôt abandoned to my own devices (aka not hydrating enough), I sped along the alpine climate where surprisingly it did not snow!To make matters even better there were lots of pretty ridge walks; I didn‚Äôt realize at the time but the ridges straddled TN and NC most of the time.

While hiking downward PBJ texted us that he had extra room but the timing was tight to make the shuttle, so we had to hustle down making me skip swimming in beautiful pools of water (we were low enough that I was hot and sweaty again) and I wasn‚Äôt thrilled to rush downhill especially after doing the longest day yet.

We chatted with the Boy Scouts about our experiences hiking, how school was going for them, but mostly we were left alone with the other hikers who had wandered by chanting ‚Äòholy shit‚Äô while the Boy Scouts cooked and ran around hitting each other with sticks.

It was a weird vibe of ‚ÄòI‚Äôve been off trail for weeks, and what do I do with my life?‚Äô even though it had been 1.5 days of resting. LOLOL. But nonetheless it was just a super nice lazy day of napping, movie watching, chilling out, and icing my knee. No complaints here.¬†


At dinner 4 more of our friends rolled in, and we had dinner with them - I ordered a patty melt, onion rings, and chicken wings. My quest to find a good cheeseburger on the trail continues! I‚Äôve noticed on the trail that no one seems to understand that medium rare means a pink interior - alas alas. Life is hard but I shall continue to consume cheeseburgers until I find ~the one~.Post dinner I lay in bed but yearned for another cappuccino muffin so I went downstairs to the kitchen and score! There were a bunch laying around so I took one and happily scarfed it down. Life is good.","Carver‚Äôs Gap

He was super sweet, and SP was extremely happy to see him (in part because he brought us food and a new pair of boots for SP as his were falling apart at the tread, but also you know, familial love yadda yadda).¬†
We stopped by Laurel Fork Falls which was stunning - it looked like a supervillain‚Äôs lair brutalist entrance, basically Syndrome‚Äôs lair from the Incredibles. We climbed up to stand under the spray, which was so bracingly cold and powerful.¬†
Afterwards we passed a dayhiker (and AT class of 2016) who recommended falls further up the trail as well, which were nice but nowhere nearly as cool as the first falls. The falls made me think of an Icelandic road trip I took with my dad, and how we would stop off to look at waterfalls or ‚Äòfoss‚Äô as they were called. Sidebar - funnily enough, people think thruhiking is sketchy but that trip was so sketchy in parts versus the AT which I‚Äôve always felt safe on (besides the bears). We both were traumatized by white-knuckle driving through a blizzard that had whiteout conditions and we had to rely on GPS for hours as we couldn‚Äôt see the roads. And then we got trapped in a prairie cabin for New Year‚Äôs with a single packet of spaghetti, sauce, and rye crackers with an assortment of mediocre movies on DVD. But you know what? I felt it was a great exercise in communication where the result was literally life or death, at least it felt that way at the time. We should have just gone to Petra and lived out our Indiana Jones moment. Anyways digression over, moral of the story is that we didn‚Äôt see any Northern Lights and they may or not exist.
It was supposed to rain so we stopped at Mountaineer Falls shelter for lunch, after which the cousin headed back to the trailhead. SP and I discussed that while it seemed to threaten rain, it didn‚Äôt seem like it would be a downpour so we decided to risk hiking further to either a campsite or Moreland Gap shelter only 2.5 miles further than that. It was humid with sprinkles the whole day but no actual rain, so that was a good call on our parts to push. While hiking we came across a bench overlooking a picturesque view, and sat down for ‚Äò10 seconds.‚Äô An hour later we got up and got moving again. But alas SP saw a bear cub climb down a tree and run to its momma, which¬†freaked him out (understandably) so we banged our sticks and shouted to keep them away. He also felt we should press to the shelter since there was bear activity, and despite feeling blah and internally grumbling to myself about having to hike some more, I was glad we did the extra miles to shorten tomorrow‚Äôs hike.¬†
We made it to camp at 8:09pm, I speed set up my tent, scarfed down 3 tuna creations (gojuchang and red curry flavors do not mix well with the Cheezits and babka I ate earlier today, and my soul is troubled), and went to bed.

Two guys pulled up in a minivan and asked about our hike, and after the conversation tried to give us $10 for our time which we politely declined. We were happy to talk about our experiences and getting paid for it made it feel mercenary versus an organic conversation.We hiked around the lake (sadly the water tasted AWFUL; nothing like cold, delicious, refreshing mountain spring water as this was warm and stagnant‚Ä¶)¬†and when we stopped to chat with a SOBO hiker SP‚Äôs water bottle fell out and rolled down a hill!

We were slackpacking the missing miles, however in my sleepy morning state I had forgotten to put in a fresh processor battery and the low battery warning beeped 30 minutes into the day. I thought to myself, ‚Äòwell fuck, let me turn it off to conserve battery,‚Äô and then of course we run into someone I had been wanting to get to know better as we kept crossing paths at hostels but never had the time to have a good conversation. She was waiting around for more hikers to come through so she could caravan up through the section around Abington shelter¬†which had the aggressive juvenile bear stalking the area. Another friend bumped into us and then we moved off as a convoy - of course which I was the lead for and SP hid in the back (‚ÄòI did my time‚Äô was his reasoning, and fair enough. He did fend off the bear that night back in NC). But I was kicking myself the entire time for having forgotten to change batteries as I could hear they were having what seemed to be a lively chat behind me, but I couldn‚Äôt hear well enough to join. I banged my sticks and shouted to scare off the bear, even though Phoenix requested I hold off until she got eyes on the bear and was able to get a video (can you tell she hadn‚Äôt had a bear encounter yet at this point?). We stopped at the Abington shelter to quickly refill water, keeping our packs with us as to minimize chances of them getting swiped, and moved on. During the lunch break with the convoy and a bunch of new folks I met, I was able to see folks‚Äô faces and join in the conversation, which recharged my social battery and made me feel better. Post lunch I really wanted to sprint back to the hostel and change my battery (when it‚Äôs dead and I‚Äôm out and about it feels like a limb randomly fell off, and it drives me mad. I can‚Äôt stand the sensation, but when I‚Äôm home alone I never have my ears in and it‚Äôs blissful. Context is everything). SP was fine to head off with me, but Phoenix wanted to digest her food, so we said we‚Äôd see her at dinner, and¬†sprinted into Damascus. It was an excellent slackpack, went by super fast and felt like a nice stretch versus being strenuous.¬†
Once in town, we walked past the Virginia Creeper trail, we made a pitstop at the new and incredibly nice AT visitor center (Damascus is ‚ÄòTrail Town, USA‚Äô as it‚Äôs at the confluence of various trails), and I shopped my feelings away at the Damascus Outfitters. SP picked up a sick mushroom-patterned Kavu hat which got him compliments from literally everyone who saw him today. Strangely enough the hat reminds me of a Vermeer portrait even though it‚Äôs literally the furthest thing possible, but I think it‚Äôs because it frames the wearer in a black halo that‚Äôs quite painterly.¬†
Post shopping and exploring town, we got back to the hostel and I was able to change my battery! Felt like the limb eas reattached. After a few hours I texted Phoenix about dinner and we settled on the diner. We walked over with our new hats, and saw Air Quotes was there! So we had dinner with him and everyone we saw today. While eating we saw 3 more hikers we knew come in, including one who just did 32 miles into town and looked ROUGH - I would too if I did that much mileage in a day. I haven‚Äôt even crossed 20 yet, I keep flirting with that limit but never crossing it.

We saw a friend who looked very happy, as her trailmance had been doing big miles to catch up with her and he had finally caught up. I dumped my gear outside, and¬†ordered a griddled cheeseburger (grilled cheese hamburger), onion rings, apple pie, and two scoops of coffee ice cream in a waffle cone. While waiting for food, I went to talk to a hiking pair we leapfrog and they were surprised to see us as they thought we were long ahead of them (it seems a lot of folks think we hike faster than we actually do, but we‚Äôve also been slowed down by medical zeros). Lunch was served, and¬†the two scoops of ice cream ended up being more like 4 scoops, which I topped w peanut m&ms and crushed sugar cone to make a sundae. Delicious, and a great way to catch up on my calorie deficit (I think lunch was easily 2500 calories).

We tried to leave around 3, but then I tragically dropped my chicken tenders so I had to re-order it.

Can‚Äôt start too young I guess, and the entertainment was worth the cash float. We hiked on, breaking for dinner at the 600 mile sign.

Sandy ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666278,"Some context is needed: this entire hike I have seen PATCH MCCRAKEN NOBO 23 graffitied EVERYWHERE. No shelter, table, or privy was safe from Patch‚Äôs reign of terror. I imagined Patch to be a wiry ginger dude who was long ahead of me, and even joked to SP the day before that I was going to post on Reddit looking for Patch and telling them I would fight him to make him stop graffitiing EVERYTHING. Let‚Äôs set the scene: this morning we‚Äôre packing, and the old lady tented next to me came up to us to compliment how we were so quiet when we came in and set up and weren‚Äôt disruptive to folks‚Äô sleep. Straightforward enough right? We‚Äôre about to leave when a guy walks up to us and asks ‚ÄòPatch, do you want to get water‚Äô to which SP asks incredulously to the old lady ‚Äòwait, are YOU Patch McCracken????‚Äô to which she‚Äôs like ‚Äòwhy yes! Why do you ask?‚ÄôThis was like a Scooby Doo villain reveal, but instead of a villain an old lady. The other guy is revealed to be Lt. Dan who I have also seen graffitiing all over the place, but more recently than Patch. This was a little awkward at this point because SP tells her I had been looking for her the whole hike, and when she asks why I mumble something about the graffiti but of course SP says that I want to fight her because of all the graffiti, as he‚Äôs an instigator and can‚Äôt let a good opportunity pass by. To which she comes closer, and Lt. Dan and SP both immediately place bets on her winning (gee, thanks) but I smooth it over by asking her to graffiti my powerbank (which I then immediately regret because now it looks like I stole it from her) and we end up taking a picture together to document the occasion and she gifts me her silver sharpie. What are the odds that I would not only run into her but tent next to her? It‚Äôs a small small world on the trail. Amazingly random encounter done and all good (SP confirms to Patch that I was kidding about fighting her, I was just stunned to actually meet her in the flesh versus just some amorphous entity in my head), we move on.

Today we felt disinterested in hiking, ¬†listening to music to force the time to pass when normally we‚Äôre content to chill, look around, and zone out to the sounds of nature and each others‚Äô random thoughts. After crossing a cool suspension bridge, we had lunch and I finally had the Good to Go kale bean stew. It was so awful SP could see my morale get zapped to zero so he suggested we take a nero and go to a nearby hostel, Weary Feet Hostel. I was stubborn about considering it initially but caved, which good thing I did because as soon we started walking to the hostel I just kept thinking ‚ÄòTHANK GOD.‚Äô As Goldie would say, you should be live, laugh, loving the hike and today was a day in which I was not. Instead of forcing it, sometimes it‚Äôs best to just give up for the day and take a shower.¬†
The hostel advertised burgers made from their cows, which we ordered along with 3 slices of cake (as to sample all 3 flavors on deck - strawberry, vanilla, chocolate). I went up to shower while the food was being cooked, and coming back down I saw Rabbit! We had initially met him shuttling into Damascus and last ran into him at Quarter Way Inn. While eating with him, the hikers we saw yesterday at the grill rolled in for a quick lunch. Post socialization, I read for a bit and did laundry - after which I went to the porch and saw a huge contingent of folks (2 hiking groups plus other soloish hikers) and we all hung out until dinner was served.¬†I had hamburger steak and gravy, terrible canned string beans, sweet potatos, and Mac and cheese, and cups and cups of sweet iced tea.

We decided to slackpack the missing miles between VA 613 and 4 Pines over 2 days, as SP was anxious to meet his cousin in Roanoke as the tentative plan was for the cousin to meet us for a weekend of hiking.

Sandy ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666300,"I did not love going down the Priest mountain with its 3000 feet of downhill, and I wiped out 2x in 5 minutes which is so unlike me. I‚Äôve only wiped out 2 other times in the entire hike so far that I can remember. I majorly bent a pole going down the second time, but better the pole bends than me!When I got to the bottom,¬†SP and Rabbit were hanging out drinking beer and eating oranges ¬†- trail magic! I chatted with the woman providing the trail magic, who was section hiking and supporting her boyfriend who was doing a thru. While I declined the beer, I accepted her offer to take my trash - which, score! Best trail magics are always fresh fruit snacks and getting trash packed out.For lunch I made green Chile hatch Mac and cheese, which is my current favorite meal even if it‚Äôs super light on calories. While munching on it, a car pulled up to drop off hikers and then the drivers offered us Doritos, oranges, and Bobos snack bars!! How amazing. I ate the Doritos from my hand like a butterfly (lapping it up with my tongue lol) and I yearned to ask for more, but didn‚Äôt want to be greedy. A crazy amount of trail magic, how random but very welcomed. And I didn‚Äôt even manifest this. Post trail magic feast, we set off again for an immediate 3000 feet uphill climb (what was the point of the descent then?). It was hot as balls and I was sweating. Because my straw was broken (call out to Platypus, I bought this in Hot Springs and it didn‚Äôt even last 500 miles) I couldn‚Äôt sip and hike which was annoying, but my left arm was more flexible than when I started the hike so I could grab and put away my smartwater bottle while hiking.¬†
We decided to blue blaze with the Mau-Har trail which was supposed to be super scenic. It started with an insanely steep up and down, but then had a pretty path passing waterfalls for a mile. I jumped in a pool and it was SO refreshing. I wish I had more time to splash around but it was threatening to rain and SP already had hiked off because he didn‚Äôt want to be scrambling off trail in the rain - which, fair enough. I caught up with him on an uphill but my shorts were very slow to dry which was disappointing since they were shorts presumably geared to be worn outside‚Ä¶. since the brand is called Outdoor Research. We marched onwards trying to make it to Reid Gap so we could hitch to Devils Backbone brewery to shower and tent for the night. SP had his usual last hour of the day bonk, so we snackbreaked and then marched on. Of course as we started the final mile descending into the gap it started to rain, which felt but hyper localized to us as we could see the blue skies to either side of us which made the rain feel very personal. We were like ‚Äòfuck this‚Äô and just rushed down instead of stopping to put on jackets, shouting ‚Äòfuck you rain!‚Äô all the way down. Of course when SP got to the gap and finally put on his rain jacket, the weather immediately cleared. Rude.Respawn had already been at the gap for 20 minutes trying to hitch a ride, and we collectively were unsuccessful for another 20 minutes to get a hitch or shuttle driver. At this point I walked away from the guys, up to the road junction to try and seem like a solo hitch. Of course the next 2 cars then immediately pulled over. Success! LOL.
We got to the brewery, and I was chilled from the rain but didn‚Äôt put on a fleece - should have! I was just so hungry and wanted to eat. I ordered the nachos, smokehouse platter, and 3 samples of their sour beers with different syrups (passion fruit habanero, strawberry rhubarb, and ginger thyme which tasted like kombucha). The sour was surprisingly delicious as I notoriously dislike the taste of alcohol and hops. I was still hungry after all that food, but the AC was roaring on full blast and the place was closing down, so we left. I grabbed some paper towels on the way out as the brewery did not provide towels for its showers, but when we stepped outside it started storming. And I mean storming. The thunder shook the roof we were standing under, and the rain was coming in sheets sideways. We made the executive decision to flee to Stanimals Waynesboro since they ‚Äòhad floor space available‚Äô and while we were frantically dialing shuttle drivers Respawn wisely remembered the existence of Uber and called us a ride. Rabbit had already set up his tent since he got there first (he was able to nab the first car he tried to hitch) so he had to run out into the storm and grab his stuff. And he got DRENCHED. The Uber came and deposited us at Stanimals where showered, and decided to sleep on the living room floor (sleepover party!). Annoyingly someone decided that it was the perfect time to start playing Mario Kart (despite it being past hiker midnight‚Ä¶) so we couldn‚Äôt go to sleep until 11. But at least we were clean, warm, dry, and sheltered from the rain.¬†","Spy Rock Junction

Sandy ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666301,"This morning Spills walked in the living room to say hi, and I realized we must have started catching up with folks given we a) hiked in the rain and b) monster miles the past few days. We decided to slackpack today, whee!
We road walked instead of taking the trail, since it mostly ran parallel and the views were more scenic. We walked with Rabbit and Respawn for the entire day, and it was a fun change of pace! At the visitor center we talked to some bike tourists about their kit set up, which was fun to see the gear in action and get advice as I‚Äôm thinking of a bikepacking adventure next. The road walk itself was murder on my feet and joints since the road was so hard, and I wasn‚Äôt used to walking in the direct sun since you know‚Ä¶. Green tunnel. Anyways the road walk shaved 5 miles off the red line mileage so we ~only~ did 14 miles, which is crazy how that feels like a walk versus exercise, even though it is objectively a lot of exercise even slackpacking.
We got back, showered, and we all went out for (mediocre) burgers. I have yet to have a good burger on this hike, just saying for the record. Post dinner we¬†went to Kline‚Äôs Dairy Bar where I got a scoop of speculoos custard. After this I went¬†back to the bunk room, read more of the Catcher in the Rye (I‚Äôve been meaning to read it and I saw a copy was moving from hostel to hostel and it was finally my turn to read it), and fell asleep at 7:20 pm with the lights on as I was so tired!","Reid Gap
