Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659617,"I first set foot on the Appalachian Trail over 40 years ago. It was the trail I grew up hiking and the trail I returned to when life threw me curve balls.
I've hiked many other trails over the years and hopefully still have more to hike, but recently I've felt the pull to go home.
Everyone says the Appalachian Trail has changed quite a bit, but I'm guessing the AT is still the same, and mostly the humans have changed. :-)",,View Entry,"Dec 26, Mon",0
Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659618,"My gear has changed a lot over the years, mostly because I'm a gear addict who loves trying out all the new innovations. Below is my main gear. It's a little long so I broke it out.ShelterMy shelter of choice has been Dyneema single wall shelters for about the past ten years. I've used shelters from Zpacks, Tarptent, Gossamer Gear, and Big Agnes, and there were things I loved about them. There were also things I did not like about the Dyneema shelters, like condensation and big footprints, so recently, I returned to a double-wall shelter.On this hike, I'll be using a Big Agnes Tiger Wall UL1. As the gear I need has decreased over the years, so has the room I need in my shelter. All my gear will fit in the tent, and condensation is not an issue. I used this tent when I hiked the Superior Trail in October and was pleasantly surprised at how much better I slept. I was not drifting through a light slumber, constantly waking up to wipe down my shelter and ensure my quilt was not getting wet. It did not matter how or where I set up my Dyneema shelter or tarp, condensation was usually a PIA.BackpackI won't list all of the backpacks I've tried, but it is most every brand, especially the ultralight brands. On the last few hikes, I used ULA equipment packs. They are relatively lightweight, have a full frame, and are the most comfortable backpack I've found that provides a good balance of weight and durability. I've used their Catalyst, Circuit, Ohm, and CDT. I'll start the AT with the Ohm and switch to the CDT when it warms up.SleepI'm starting the trail at the end of February, and it will still be cold, with winter storms not uncommon. In below-freezing temperatures, I like to use a sleeping bag,Â but I don't expect the cold temps to last that long so I'm taking my three-season and summer quilts, which combined weigh as much as my zero-degree sleeping bag. The quilts are 15-degree and 40-degree quilts. When the weather warms up, I'll send a quilt home.I also now use a small inflatable Sea-to-Summit pillow. During my ultralight days, I stuffed my clothes in a stuff-sack, resulting in a small clothing brick a few hours later. My pillow has dramatically improved my sleep quality and, thus, the quality of my hiking.I also wear my Goosefeet that I was given for Christmas last year. They weigh next to nothing, and I no longer wake up with cold feet. They will also probably go home as soon as I'm through the Smoky Mountains.ClothingI'm a hiker and not a camper, so I don't need many clothes to sit around camp. I usually walk until I stop, set up camp, and climb into my tent. For the colder season, I'll wear a beanie, a light-weight base layer (sleep), a mid-weight base layer, light-weight fleece (100 wt full-zip), puffy tights, rain pants, hiking shorts, sleeping shorts, three-pair of light-weight Darn Tough socks, rain pants, rain jacket, glove liners, and rain mitts.I sleep in the puffy when it is cold and pull the hood over my head. I also wear my beanie. I usually only sleep in running shorts and a lightweight shirt, even when it is cold. I also don't typically sleep in socks, so my feet can air and dry overnight.Â  I will wear my Goosefeet if it is very cold, though.Once it warms up, I send home my mid-weight shirt, Goosefeet, heavier puffy, and tights. I get my lightweight puffy, and short sleeve Woolx hiking shirt. Woolx is relatively new for me. They are the most comfortable wool hiking shirts I have used. I've always used Patagonia, Smart Wool, Icebreaker, etc., but I recently switched to Woolx.UmbrellaI'm one of ""those"" hikers. :-) I started using umbrellas out west years ago and then transitioned to using them in more humid, rainy climates. I don't like clammy, confined rain gear, and umbrellas keep me much warmer in the cold rain. I also like to look around and take pictures in the rain, which is easier from under an umbrella. A lot depends on the trail, though. If it is too windy, brushy, or off-trail, then I won't always use one. An umbrella has always worked well for me on the AT.FeetI've used trail runners since about 2008. I currently use HOKA Speedgoats, but also like Salomons and Asics. My sock of choice is currently Darn Tough, a recent change. I don't know what Smart Wool changed in their manufacturing process, but over the past year, all of the socks I've bought from them have fallen apart. Darn Toughs are more durable. I don't like padded socks. They sometimes bunch up and are hot, causing my feet blisters. I used Injinji on the PCT, but they fall apart to quickly also and are not inexpensive.I still get blisters sometimes, but as long as I air out my feet every time, I stop and wear clean socks, my feet toughen up quickly. Liners don't work for me either - that whole heat issue. I do wear them sometimes during winter hiking, though. M feet are so particular. It took me a long time to figure out what worked for me.Those are the main nuts and bolts, and I'm happy to answer questions if there are any. I have my website and email address in my signature on these posts.",,View Entry,"Dec 26, Mon",0
Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659619,"The introvert in me wants to start hiking a little earlier in the season and maybe get a little ahead of ""the bubble.""Â 
I don't mind the cold as long as I have my spikes so they will be along for the ride until I get through the Smoky Mountains or early April. I spend way too much time on my ass in snow and ice.Â Â 
I'm also looking forward to late Winter and Spring hiking since I prefer walking in cold weather to hot.
My next entry will be from the trail - woohooooo!",,View Entry,"Dec 26, Mon",0
Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659972,"I only have a few more weeks until I leave, and if my spreadsheet were paper, it would have holes from overuse. It is just an outline for those at home, but those at home continue to poke holes in it as they locate broken formulas and raise questions on mileage or lack of...I think formulas may have even been added. 
So, this entry tests my technical proficiency - my ability to send trail journal entries from my phone. Fingers crossed... 

I don't have much to do since I decided not to cook. Hot food is good, but on my last hike, it got tedious, so I'm just going to snack my way up the trail. I'll probably have one tooth left when I finish, maybe two since I'm taking a multivitamin. 

New in my trail news... 

My little brother is taking me to the Springer Trailhead. My flight gets into Atlanta around 8:30 AM, and I had hoped to Uber to the trailhead and get going, but that was when I had no ride. 

The send-off is appreciated, and since I come from a family of eaters, I'm sure Breakfast will be at the top of the priority list. Me, because I'm hiking uphill, and Lee, because he is driving uphill. Preferably, a huge southern breakfast. We may even have to stop by Chik-fil-a to get some post-breakfast chicken biscuits to take with us. 

I had hoped Lee could hike the mile down to the plaque and terminus with me, but he had a hole drilled into his knee (intentionally) a few weeks ago. He hasn't been able to put any weight on his knee, but he now has a brace, so maybe he can gimp down the trail with me, and we can celebrate with biscuits and Mountain Dew (his favorite beverage). He is pretty tough and will be calorie propelled, so we will see. 

That's about it. Wishing all the early starters warmish temperatures and rain gear that doesn't leak. March is a crazy weather month in the southern Appalachians and historically gets the most rain!",,ME,"Jan 27, Fri",7
Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660099,"This is really another test entry from my phone because my last one was a debacle and Iâ€™m not sure which of the 15 versions I sent was correct. For this test I'll offer something that may be helpful. 
Over the years I've had to travel with my gear. In some instances the TSA has taken my hiking poles, a small Gerber knife, and questioned my stove. I'm not fussing because the rules were clear, but they were still frustrating lessons. 
This is how I now travel with my gear. 
This time I'm mailing it to my brother who is taking me to the trail. I'll still carry my empty pack with my electronics but that is about it. 
Sometimes I'll box up my poles, stove, and everything but my tent, quilt, and electronics which I carry with me in my pack. I'll then check the box and pick it up in baggage claim when I arrive. 
On some hikes I have purchased an inexpensive duffle bag, maybe from a thrift store, and used that instead of a box. Either works fine. 
Whatever you do just know that sometimes TSA cares and sometimes they do not. With the poles, I had them closed up in my pack and they still cared, but I knew the rules and chose to roll the dice, and lost. Bummer... 
To those already hiking stay warm, and to everyone waiting - WE ARE SO FREAKIN CLOSE! Happy trails! ðŸ™‚",,ME,"Feb 09, Thu",0
Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660187,"Food on the trail has always been the most complicated part of my hikes. I have always used resupply boxes because I found them easier, but to some extent these always dictated my schedule which was a little annoying. 
This year I have simplified things. I am not using boxes and I am not starting out cooking. 
Instead of resupply boxes with dinners and some snacks, I will purchase those in town. 
I'm also not cooking since I'll be resupplying every 3-4 days. I'm not sure I can be called a cold soaker since I eat sandwiches and wraps, but sometimes I'll soak some noodles. 
Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a hot meal at the end of the day but on my last hike I found them a bit of a hassle. I'll also be eating hot food so frequently on the AT that I won't miss them much. 
My food will look more like this. 
Breakfast is usually whatever healthier, dense grain cereal I can find with dried fruit in it. I usually add some nuts and NIDO. I'm always changing the cereal so I never get tired of it. I used to like Poptarts and Honeybuns (and still do) but the simple carbs and sugars don't last all that long when I'm hiking and I'm just hungry again too soon. 
Snacks are usually cheese, salted nuts, dried fruit, some type of bar that does not make me gag, wheat thins, nut butters, some jerky, avocados (they are heavy but so good on the first day or two), veggie chips, powder hummus if I can find it, etc. My guilty pleasure is an occasional hostess snack pie (yum!). 
Lunch is usually whole wheat tortillas with nut butters and honey. If offerings are limited I'll take PB&J. 
Dinner is often just snacks and more tortillas. I usually hike until it is time to sleep. I'm not a big camper unless I find a cool spot or view and then I'll stop earlier. 
I used to eat all the food drugs, and still do sometimes, but it is less and less on each hike. Pizza, chips, cookies, candy bars, Ramen, potatoes, etc. I loved all these and lost weight while I ate them, but at the end of my hikes I was a slave to carbs and could not kick my hiker hunger and just gained back the weight. 
Now I find that if I try and eat a little healthier it is easier to keep off some weight when I get home. I'm still hungry for a few weeks but I don't have the eat everything in sight cravings. 
So that is my food on this trip. It looks a little boring but I'm always finding something new as I wander around grocery and convenience stores. I also always take sandwiches out of towns so I don't worry about food on day one.",,ME,"Feb 18, Sat",0
Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660260,"Over the past 12 months, I have added weight to my backpack. I have used tarp tents since 2009, and for this hike, I'm returning to a double-walled tent. I sleep better without worrying about getting dripped on. 
Now, I am switching from the trail runners I have used since 2008 to my Oboz trail shoes. It appears that comfort and convenience are beginning to have a bigger impact than they did in my youth when I could walk on nails and sleep on stone slabs - ha!

I've been wearing HOKA Challengers and, more recently, Speedgoats, but over the last few months, I found myself wearing my Oboz more and more. My feet were not getting as beat up on the east coast roots and rocks, and they are much more stable, so I am faster downhill. 

I also find my feet less fatigued in the Oboz over longer distances. A twenty-mile day in HOKAs leaves my feet tired, while a twenty-mile day in Oboz - not so much. 

I was surprised when I realized my feet felt more rested in the Oboz, and I started paying more attention on hikes. In my trail runners, my feet had to work a lot harder, and I had to pay more attention to foot placement. When wearing my Oboz, I did not worry as much about placement, and my feet were more balanced and supported, especially when I came down hard in my backpack. In essence, my shoes are doing the work when I wear my Oboz, and my feet are doing the work when I wear my trail runners. 

There are some questions and disadvantages to Oboz. When they get wet, they take forever to dry. In my trail runners, I stomped through streams and rivers and walked out the water till the trail runners were dry. I can't do that in my Oboz. 

The Oboz are a pound heavier than my Speedgoat 5's, which is not a big deal once I get my trail legs, but it always comes up when hikers compare the two. 

The Oboz are hot. Starting in February, this will be no big deal, but it will be when it warms up. 

All that said, I'm starting with my Oboz. My Speedgoats are sitting on a table, ready to be mailed out, and we will see how things go. 

If my Oboz make it, I expect them to last the whole trail, which will be a plus for the Oboz since I usually have to replace my trail runners every 400-500 miles. 

This will be interesting for this long-time trail runner hiker. Go Oboz!",,ME,"Feb 24, Fri",0
Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660586,"I was upÂ at 3:30AMÂ and ready to get to the airport. My ride watched me blearily and my dog disgustedly. I was leaving, and way too early.
It was exciting to finally be underway. I had planned for this hike less than other hikes in the past, but I was really looking forward to hiking a long trail again. The last couple of years have been shorter trails like the SHT, AZT, BMT, etc., and while they were all great hikes, nothing compares to trekking thousands of miles over several months with all you own on your back.
My brother picked me up at the airport and we went in search of a diner for breakfast. It was nice to be able to pock what I really wanted from the menu instead of what was ""wise aka healthy.""
We checked me in at Amicalola, listened to the trail intro from the rangers, and I got my bright purple tag stating I was an Appalachian Trail thru-hiker. I was number 532 and 27 other hikers should be starting today.
The rangers gave us directions to the Springer parking lot, but I had punched in coordinates to Gaia, so we crawled a winding road up another side of the mountain. Lee was carsick and agreed to wait in the truck until I returned from hiking the mile up to the southern terminus. It was foggy, misty and chilly - a perfect March GA mountain day.
Arriving back at the parking lot I wished my wonderful brother goodbye and took off. It wasÂ 2:30PMÂ and time to log a few miles!
Hawk Mountain was where I had decided to stop for the day and as the shelter came into view I was shocked at the number of people. There had to have been 30 tents and twenty people standing around the front of the shelter. I had hoped starting in February would put me a little ahead of the bubble but I guess not.
I pitched my tent as far away as possible but still close enough to hear a Yorkie (bear bait) barking each time there was a noise. It would be a earplug night.","Springer Mountain

Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661104,"I was up and out of camp early. It was going to begin raining around noon and I wanted to get some miles in before the trail got slick. I'm not the most coordinated person and often find my self in the mud on my butt if downhills get all greasy. It's probably just luck I've nit been given the trail name ""Wallow.""
I stopped at Gooch Gap for lunch and chatted with Mitch who had just retired from the Navy, and aptly named Slug who was finishing up his 9 month southbound thru-hike. I was amazed at the tenacity of Slug hiking through the winter since I was getting chilled as I sat there talking to him in 50 degree temperatures. I am definitely a cold whimp.
There were a couple of other hikers but they came in as I was heading out. Most everyone was either staying at Gooch or going to a hostel to wait out the rain. As long as lightning does not get too close though I'll keep walking. This is the AT and it would be an awfully long hike if I stopped when it rained.
The rest of the afternoon it rained non-stop but I was pretty comfortable under my umbrella stomping through the mud puddles in my waterproof Oboz. The Oboz have worked out well so far, although I have noticed a little rubbing that I did not have on day hikes. This was why I bought them in wide and a larger size for this hike. We will see how they go. Â 
The weather was supposed to clear out overnight so I knew it would probably be windy in Jarrard Gap, but as it grew dark I also had no desire to campsite hunt at night, even with my headlamp.
Since I thought I was supposed to have a bear canister starting at the Jarrard I camped just south of the gap and staked down my tent for high winds. I later learned the regulations had not yet gone into effect.
There was another tent further up the hill but it was late, so I settled into bed, glad to rest my aching feet.Â 
The one thing I do like about the Oboz is how much less fatigued I find my feet at the end of the day. I am also more sure footed and hike downhills more quickly. I hope they work out because I really like their structure.","Hawk Mountain

Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661106,"The climb up to the summit of Blood Mountain was stunning this morning, and I met three other thru-hikers - Marge, John and Polar Plunge the jolly crazy Floridian that swims in the creeks. I love the trail name he was given.
They had all slept in the shelter overnight and said it was freezing until they covered one of the windows with a ground sheet. Since they did not mention it, I'm assuming the supposed resident skunk did not make an appearance. It was a beautiful spot and I did not blame them for staying the night. If I lived close you would always find me up there on summer nights stretched out on the large boulder next to the stone cabin - snuggling with the skunk!
Then it was down to Neels Gap and the outdoor store for some snacks and two frozen burritos.Â 
The climb down was more challenging than the climb up, picking my way over rocks and roots, but views were breathtaking near the top and there were several amazing long distance vistas.Â 
Once at Neels Gap I chatted with other hikers for about an hour, called home, and then began the climb up from Neels where I met First Grader, a retired school teacher from Michigan - nice fella. He asked if he could tag along with me and we hiked til camping near Low Gap shelter with about 30 other people.Â 
I'm still waiting for the herd to thin but so far that has not happened. Every shelter is full and ringed by a display of colorful tents, like little galaxies along the trail. When will the universe open up?!
There were some stiff climbs throughout the day like Testnasee Gap which First Grader referred to as the Nasty climb and we spent most of the afternoon flip flopping with a group of 10 out from Atlanta. We smiled and nodded all afternoon since I could not understand a word they said and by late day were nodding, grinning friends.Â 
Although they did not have backpacks they were still amazingly fast, and there appeared to be about three generations with the oldest one taking the lead and out hiking all the rest! I would grin every time he passed me and he would grin back and nod as he trotted by me.
Campsites were limited when we stopped at the shelter, but it was almost dark and we needed water. I found First Grader and I a couple of campsites and we called it a day. I wished him a good hike since I probably wouldn't see him the next morning, ate dinner quickly, and tried to get comfortable on my slant.
I listened to dogs barking and people fussing but it eventually quieted down for the night. Unfortunately, I would probably stir up the dogs again when I left early the next morning.","Jarrard Gap

Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661251,"Today was Georgia tough sprinkled with a marvelous sunrise, tough climbs, rocks, roots and lots of hikers.
Rain and wind were supposed to move in overnight so I wanted to get past Trey Mountain and it's high peak.
I climbed out of Low Gap shelter and up 1000 feet over Blue Mountain before dropping straight back down 1000 feet to Unicoi Gap where I stopped to bandage my pinkie toes and watch other hikers consume trail magic I had missed by five seconds (sniff).
After a snack I climbed 800 feet down again before beginning my 1,500 foot climb up Trey Mountain. OMG, these climbs! Georgia definitely breaks or breaks in new hikers.Â 
Winds had picked up under grey skies as I approached the summit and turned off on the spur trail to the shelter to get water. The water source appeared to be about 100 yards behind the shelter.
This shelter appeared to be crowded like all the ones before it with tents in any empty spots, and a crowd of men gathered out front of the shelter. They greeted me as I approached. I said hello and asked about the water source. They pointed me in the right direction.
There was another small group at the water and I quickly filled my bottles from the pipe and left. I could feel the introvert in me beginning to get a little overwhelmed.
As I passed the shelter the group out front asked where I was going. I said I was going to drop lower out of the weather and continued on as they all stood staring. Good or bad? Hmmm...
I hiked down about a mile further into a gap where Russell, Randy and John were camped. The gap was out of the wind and would provide some protection.
I said hello and then moved off into the trees to clear a space and set up my tent, making sure I set up on a good bed of leaves to drain away water.
I was not in a social mood so I waved to the guys and then set climbed into my tent and burrowed under my quilt before quickly falling asleep.","Low Gap Shelter
