KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664962,"In January, my hiking buddy Look Back announced that was planning a southbound section hike of the Appalachian Trail from Newfound Gap in Great Smoky Mountains National Park to Winding Stair Gap near Franklin, NC. He invited me to join him, and I gladly accepted. We hadn't hiked together in several years, and I looked forward to reconnecting. But there was an unanticipated glitch in the plan.
Shortly after my section hike of the Florida Trail (https://www.trailjournals.com/...), I tripped while running on a trail in a local park. The sudden stop fractured two bones, and the accident put me out of commission for a while. I'm now carrying a piece of titanium gear that's not just for hiking! I didn't know whether I'd be sufficiently recovered to go backpacking on 9 June. Mobility and strength have been returning steadily, if slowly. The good news is that the surgeon and the occupational therapist have given me the green light to hit the trail again. I'm psyched!

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665069,"Coincidence! Today was sunny and warm in North Carolina, but on a 14-mile day hike I saw only four people. I stopped and talked with a couple of them, one of whom I learned was the volunteer maintainer of Whiskey Hollow Shelter on the AT in northern Virginia. I rarely sleep in trail shelters, preferring my tent. But Whiskey Hollow was an exception: almost exactly a year ago, on 7 June, I spent a rainy night in Whiskey Hollow Shelter (https://www.trailjournals.com/...). I told the maintainer I had stayed there, and I thanked him for the work he does, but unfortunately I didn't catch his name.",,View Entry,"Jun 05, Mon",0
KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665190,"Look Back picked me up after work today to start the drive to the trailhead. We'll stop at a hotel tonight. Tomorrow, we'll position his truck, shuttle to the trailhead, and start our hike. 
I'm psyched, for a couple of reasons. Of course, I'm looking forward to spending a week on the trail. But I'm also excited because my fractured bones have healed enough for me to undertake the hike without a splint. Earlier this week, a day hike with a loaded pack told me that my left arm isn't ready to use a trekking pole, but I was able to make do with a single pole in my right hand. I'll need to watch my step more carefully than usual, but that's a small price to pay. I'm reminded to be grateful that I can undertake a backpacking trip at all!",,View Entry,"Jun 08, Thu",0
KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665272,"The day started with a drive to Franklin, NC. Haze from extensive wildfires in Québec obscured some long-range views but wasn't otherwise objectionable. Shuttle driver Bobby the Greek picked up Lookback and me in Franklin and drove us to the huge, busy parking lot at Newfound Gap in the heart of Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP). Arriving shortly after 11:00, we found a quiet place to eat our lunches, which consisted mostly of items from the breakfast buffet at the Fairfield Inn. We took advantage of the parking lot trash cans to dispose of apple cores, orange peels, and as much excess food packaging as we could. 

We started up the trail a few minutes past noon. The crowds dissipated in just a few yards. Engine noises dissipated, and birdsongs replaced human voices. It was calm, bright, sunny, and cool (upper 50s F). It felt wonderful to be back on trail in the mountains. I wondered if many of the people back in the parking lot knew what they were missing just a couple hundred yards away. 

On the short walk to the shelter, we crossed a few dayhikers and four backpackers. I stopped and talked with Tyler and JJ. JJ had started at Amicalola Falls and was enjoying the start of her thru-hike. 

I arrived at Mt Collins Shelter before 2:30, with Lookback not far behind. It felt absurdly early to be stopping for the day, so we went about setting up camp as slowly and deliberately as we could. He hung his hammock, and after much dithering, I pitched my tent on a nice flat spot. 

At 5:00, I summoned Lookback to dinner at the shelter. On my menu tonight was Annie's Mac and cheese with the last of the fresh spinach, and a mandarin orange for dessert. We chatted with enthusiastic and adventurous overnighter Cotter for more than an hour before heading toward our sleeping bags shortly before 8:00.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665337,"The day dawned cool and crisp, 45° F with only a hint of a breeze. I'm glad I packed my mid-weight (15°) sleeping bag. That, combined with the mesh tent liner, kept me comfy overnight. 
I got myself out of camp in just under two hours, quite some time behind Lookback, but pretty good for me. It was a short 3-mile climb to Clingman's Dome, the highest point on the AT. There were already more than a dozen people at the top of the observation tower when I arrived. The only other hiker was Lennon. He thru-hiked southbound (SOBO) last year, so we must have crossed paths at some point. He's currently on a NOBO section hike, so we crossed again. 

I was surprised by the number of NOBO section hikers I encountered today. Trail south of Clingman's Dome, it's 32 miles of mountainous terrain to the next road crossing, so these people are likely spending at least two nights on trail. 

Lookback and I met and ate at Double Spring Gap Shelter, and again at Siler's Bald Shelter. There, we also encountered Hipster, who's on the first leg of a flip-flop thru-hike. He's currently hiking SOBO from Harpers Ferry. When he reaches Springer Mountain, he'll get mechanized transportation to Harpers Ferry, where he'll resume his hike NOBO to Katahdin. 

I reached today's destination, Derreck Knob Shelter, at 3:30. The first to arrive, I had my choice of tentsites. My timing was fortunate, because three other tenters arrived within the next half hour. Lookback arrived a half hour later and proceeded to set up his hammock. 

Eight of us gathered at the shelter for dinner. The quality of conversation improved after two know-it-all gearheads went to their tents to watch movies on their phones. (At least they didn't feel compelled to tell us why their phones were special.) One of the remaining group is eight trails away from completing ""The 900"", an impressive accomplishment. Two of the others started at Amicalola Falls and are ""walking toward Maine."" Whether or not they reach Katahdin, I'm sure they'll each have a grand adventure! One, Snakebite, showed me impressive photos he had taken of a timber rattler and a large black bear, both up close. These kinds of interactions are a big part of what makes the AT special.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665376,"A breeze picked up overnight, and the air was humid at dawn, but the rain held off until 9:00 AM. That made for easy breakfast, pack-up, and departure. 

Once again, Lookback was the first to hit the trail SOBO. He was rewarded with a bear sighting shortly after leaving camp. 

It rained on and off as we hiked, making it challenging to stay comfortable. There were no views from the overlooks we passed. But the hike was still pretty. Rhodendrons, flame azaleas, and mountain laurels were all blooming at different elevations. The rain made them glisten. 

As was the case yesterday, we crossed a lot of NOBO hikers, including some who had started at Amicalola Falls. I continue to be surprised by how many there are. 

I arrived at our destination, Mollies Ridge Shelter, at the early hour of 2:30. There was a pleasant break in the rain, but the wind picked up and the clouds thickened, resulting in chilly, blowing mist for the rest of the afternoon. With one to two inches of rain in the overnight forecast, Lookback and I decided to sleep in the shelter tonight. It felt good to snuggle into my sleeping bag to dry out and warm up, especially as I watched clouds of mist blowing past just outside.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665405,"My Smoky Bear record is intact. Once again, I walked out of the Smokies without having seen a bear in the park. Never have I ever. 

Last night was rough, especially for Lookback. Four other hikers arrived at the shelter just before dark. They talked loudly and flashed their headlamps around until after 11:00 PM with no regard for the two of us trying to sleep. I knocked myself out with a sleeping pill, but Lookback laid awake. Then the forecasted rain came, with thunder and hail. To cap off his discomfort, Lookout's inflatable pad sprang a leak. He was tired today. 

Most of the day's hike was downhill to Fontana Lake. We stopped at the Fontana Dam Visitors Center to eat lunch and recharge our phones. The volunteer staff were very nice, as was the hot shower I took after lunch. 

Just a half-mile past the visitors center is the Fontana Dam Shelter, a.k.a. the Fontana Hilton. Spotlessly clean, with a view of the lake, flush toilets, a water spigot, and hot showers of its own, the Hilton is one of the most popular shelters on the trail. 

Lookback tried unsuccessfully to find the leak in his pad by dunking it in the lake and looking for bubbles. Tired and a little frustrated, he took a nap in his hammock. 

I hung my food bag and walked the mile and a half to the Fontana Resort Marina. The sun had emerged, so I rented a canoe and paddled around for an hour. It was good exercise for my left arm, which is still recovering from a fracture in March. After paddling, I resupplied from the meager pickings at the marina store. An IPA may have been consumed, as well. 

Back at the Hilton, one of the many picnic tables provided a million-dollar view of the lake and mountains while I ate my mashed potatoes. I'm still taking in the view as I write this at 8:30 PM. It's been a great day for me. I hope tomorrow is as good for Lookback as today has been for me.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665463,"Today started much better for Lookback. He slept well in his hammock, needing to reinflate his pad only once during the night. His usual spunk had returned this morning, and he seemed like a different person. 
I slept reasonably well, too, in the shelter. There were only three others in a shelter designed to accommodate 24. And unlike the night before, the other shelter dwellers repected hiker etiquette. 

Perfect hiking weather lifter our spirits, too. It was sunny with low humidity and a light breeze. The temperature climbed from the low 50s at the lake to the low 60s at the higher elevations where we spent most of the day. 

After an easy stroll to the marina, the day's hike began in earnest with a 2,000-foot climb. It was my biggest climb since Katahdin last September--although it didn't come close to Mama K category. The trail was commendably well constructed and maintained, a real pleasure to hike. 

Stopping for lunch at Cable Gap Shelter, we met NOBO LASHer (long-ass section hiker) Oatmeal. She's headed from Amicalola Falls to Damascus, about a quarter of the trail, before heading to grad school. She was also in great spirits. 

I arrived at the day's destination, Brown Fork Gap Shelter, just after 3:30, well ahead of Lookback. It took a while to find a flat tent spot and a suitable location for hanging a bear bag. It took three throws to get the rope over the branch I wanted; I'm out of practice!

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665522,"Brown Fork Gap Shelter is reputed to be inhabited by mice. (This isn't uncommon among AT shelters.) Nevertheless, I was surprised to hear mice during the night just outside my tent, about 50 yards away from the shelter. The little squeaking sounds and rustling noises were cute, but I lost a little sleep worrying about the possibility of mice chewing through my tent. A quick inspection this morning didn't reveal any damage. 
Perhaps because my tent was in a gully where the early morning light didn't penetrate, I slept late. As is not uncommon, I was the last to leave the shelter area this morning. I was more than an hour behind Lookback. 
Almost as soon as I started up the trail, I heard the sound of pneumatic hammering. It grew louder as I approached Stecoah Gap, where I came upon road construction on NC highway 143. The noise lasted a couple of hours, and while it didn't spoil the hiking experience, I was glad when it finally gave way to more natural sounds of the forest. 
The day's weather included periods of drizzle interspersed with sunshine. Temperatures were mild, near 60°F, and it didn't rain heavily enough for me to deploy my umbrella. I found it amazing early this afternoon to cross a Boy Scout troop wearing full rain gear and pack covers. They must have been hot. 
I caught up Lookback at Sassafras Gap Shelter, where we ate lunch and changed our plans. Instead of camping near a spring a few miles ahead, we decided to walk all the way to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC), where there are rooms, showers, and the resupply box we had mailed from home. 
As a bonus at Sassafras Gap, Lookback found a foam sleeping pad. It was filthy, but with a good washing at the NOC, it should make his upcoming nights more comfortable. 
The trail descended steeply to the NOC, down the infamous Jacob's Ladder. Once there, in addition to the small luxuries mentioned above, another treat was in store for me: Dustin and Carissa joined me for dinner. It was great to catch up with them during their vacation!

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665562,"It felt luxurious to dress in clean clothes this morning. Lookback started early, I waited for the NOC General Store to open so I could buy lunch...and an ice cream sandwich for second breakfast. 

The nearly 5,000-foot elevation gain made today's relatively short distance a little tougher than it would seem at first glance. The climb out of the NOC in either direction is notoriously steep. The fog was so dense and the humidity so high that the vegetation was dripping wet early this morning. I was sweating profusely in just a couple miles. 

The sun emerged at 10:00, making for a pleasant day with the best views we've had so far. The sights from Jump Off and Wesser Bald Fire Tower, although just a touch hazy, were awesome. 

Late this morning, on Paint Mountain, I stopped to chat with a couple who were taking a break. They're section hiking NOBO, as are most of the others we've met on this hike. l noticed a scallop shell on a pack, which turned the talk to their adventures on the Camino de Santiago. We ended our conversation with introductions by trail name: he's Chappy, and she's Squatsalot. I didn't need to ask how she earned the name! 

At noon, I arrived at Wesser Bald Shelter. There, a crew was erecting a new privy (ADA compliant, of course). The materials were being carried in by a group of CITs from a summer camp. I expected Lookout to be close, but some NOBO hikers said they hadn't seen him. Thinking that perhaps I had passed him, I sat down to a leisurely lunch. While I was eating, a big rat snake, nearly four feet long, cruised past me nonchalantly, as if I wasn't there. Very cool. 

Near Wesser Bald Fire Tower, I encountered a group of trail maintainers who were cutting back the overgrowth that continously tries to take over the trail. Trail crews and maintainers rarely receive the recognition and thanks they deserve for volunteering to do the hard work that's required to keep the AT in great condition. 

Early this afternoon, just before catching up with Lookback, I met NOBO section hikers Speedy and Molasses. They're sisters from the Midwest. I stopped to talk with Speedy for a while, but Molasses was still nearly a mile behind when we crossed. 

Our stop for the night is a tenting area near Cold Spring Gap Shelter. The shelter is old and dank, but the nearby tenting area is surprisingly nice, up on a ridge with plenty of flat spots for tents and stout trees for hammocks. There's even a small picnic table, where we ate dinner.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665617,"Today held surprises, some pleasant. 

Fog rolled in overnight. Although it wasn't cold, the mist blowing through my tent made it uncomfortable for sleeping. Perhaps because I tossed and turned during the night, I slept late this morning. 

The big concern of the day was Lookback's toe. The steep descent into the NOC had exacerbated a pre-existing injury, and it flared up again last night. We discussed whether he might decide to bail at Wayah Bald, significantly short of our original plan. 

I finally started hiking at 8:30, by far my latest departure on this trip. Everything was damp from the fog, but not as wet as it was yesterday. The sun broke through at 9:30, putting a smile on my face. The rest of the day featured mild temperatures, a breeze, and a mix of sun and clouds...ideal hiking conditions. Adding to the pleasurable weather were the trail conditions. Volunteers with the Nantahala Hiking Club do a commendable job maintaining and blazing the trail. 

My hiking bliss came to an abrupt end when I reached Wayah Shelter at 11:00. A campfire was burning hot and sending up smoke. There was no sign of anybody nearby. The morning fog and moisture had evaporated, and there hadn't been heavy rain in several days. Although I was anxious to catch up with our appointed rendez-vous at nearby Wayah Bald, extinguishing the fire was a greater priority. It took a quarter-mile walk to collect and return with the three liters of water needed to douse the fire. If you camp, NEVER LEAVE A FIRE BURNING! Knocking it down doesn't put it out. 

Lookback wasn't at the stone tower atop Wayah Bald when I arrived. But there was cellular service, and a message alerted me that he had decided to continue, not just to Siler Bald, our planned stop for the night, but all the way to Winding Stair Gap, tomorrow's destination. I was pleasantly surprised that he felt well enough to push through. 

The weather and trail conditions remained pleasant through the day. I eventually caught up with Lookback when he stopped for a break. He handed me his truck keys, and I pressed on ahead. When I arrived at Winding Stair Gap, a young man was filling water jugs from a piped spring at the highway pull-out. I gave a friendly wave, and as I was stashing my trekking poles, he offered me a ride into Franklin. Thirteen miles later, he dropped me off at the truck just as Lookback texted me that he had reached Winding Stair Gap. Great timing! 

After picking up Lookback at the gap, we drove to a motel where he had made a reservation. What followed were the usual post-hike rituals: showers, dinner at a Mexican restaurant, and beer at the Lazy Hiker. Tomorrow, we drive home.
