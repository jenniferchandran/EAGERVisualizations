If you’re older, like me, you probably read the above quote in the voice of Creedence Clearwater Revival or Ike & Tina Turner.  While I may not have worked for the man EVERY night and day, I did leave a good job.  Today marks my first day of retirement after 40 years at the same employer.  One of the reasons for retiring now, a little earlier than some, is to attempt a bucket list item while I’m still in good health.  I’ve lost a few friends and seen others suffer unexpected health setbacks in the last few years, so last year I moved up my Appalachian Trail start date to 2023.
A good friend that I worked with nearly all 40 of those years will be sharing in the adventure.  We’ve shared several adventures through the years, having run a marathon together, ridden a 100 mile bike race together, and in 2013 completed an iron-distance triathlon together.  It was at that point, the discussion came up of what’s the next big thing we want to tackle. We decided on a Thru-hike of the AT when we both retired.  He retired in 2020 and as of today, we are both retired, so it’s time to hit the trail! His trail name is TheOkie and you can find him on Trailjournals as well.
To make the trip even better, another friend that I initially met through business years ago is retiring this month and joining in on the adventure.  Although he lives in another state, he has come down to join us for the bike races and triathlons and is always fun to be around.  So, the more the merrier…or misery loves company…either way we are looking to start our retirements off with a great adventure!",,View Entry,"Jan 04, Wed",0
McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659758,"“You may be right….I may be crazy!” -Billy Joel
When people find out that I am attempting to Thru-Hike the Appalachian Trail, their responses usually fall into 1 of 2 categories: “What is that?” OR “You’re crazy!”  When I explain to the “What is that?” people that I will be walking 2,198.4 miles from Georgia to Maine through all 4 seasons and all that that entails, their responses usually fall into 1 category: “You’re crazy!”

For a person that prides myself on generally being logical, I must admit that this may be the most illogical thing that I could do.  Just as I am beginning to experience the newfound freedom that comes with retirement, I am giving up the comforts of my climate controlled home and wood shop to walk through 14 states carrying a backpack.  I am trading my soft, warm bed for a sleeping bag in a tent in all kinds of weather.  I am trading indoor plumbing for a life of privies and cat holes.  I am leaving behind a closet full of clean clothes to put on the same smelly clothes each morning even if they are wet or frozen.  I am even expecting to lose 20 pounds because I won’t be able to replenish the 5,000 to 6,000 calories I will burn each day.

But what I will miss most, and there isn’t even a close second, will be being with my wonderful wife.  In the 37 years that we have been married, we have only been apart for 2 weeks a handful of times.  I will look forward to her visits on trail and dread when she has to leave.  If it were not for her love and support, I would never be able to take on this adventure!

A good friend, trying to wrap their mind around what I am about to do, said, “if it isn’t fun you can just come home.”  I’m just not wired that way.  When I set my mind to something, like the traditional coldest night of the year camp out (my personal record is -12° which is pretty cold for our part of the country) or swimming 2.4 miles followed by a 112 mile bike ride followed by a 26.2 mile run, I’m too stubborn to quit.  You may be right, I may be crazy. 


So what makes me want to do it?   I’m betting that the things that I see, the experiences that I have, the great people that I meet, and the sense of personal accomplishment will all be worth it!",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Thu",0
McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659770,"“The palest ink is better than the best memory.” -Chinese ProverbWhen I decided in late 2013 that I wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail upon retiring, I developed a thirst for information of all things trail.  In early 2014 I stumbled across Trailjournals. Through the next 9 years, I would look forward to selecting 5 to 10 people a year to follow.  I still remember from my earliest days, following Flossie & Gray Squirrel as well as AstroGuy.  I began learning so much about daily life on the trail and trail culture. I learned to expect hardships, discomfort, and the inevitable bad days.  But I also learned that perseverance and pushing through those maladies would be rewarded with great views, new friendships, and heartwarming trail magic.  I can still remember getting misty-eyed at the accomplishment of total strangers climbing Mt. Katahdin even though they didn’t even know that they had taken me on their journey with them.  To this day, I still get very invested in the people I follow as I pull for their success.The often quoted success rate of completing a Thru-Hike is about 25%.  In my experience of following hikers on Trailjournals, I have seen a much, much higher success rate.  I’ve often wondered if it is the encouragement those hikers receive in their guestbooks that urge them to keep pushing through, or maybe just the sense of responsibility to not let their readers down.  I know that for myself, putting my hike out there in a very public way will just add another layer of incentive to be successful.  Taking the time at the end of each day to write a journal entry definitely takes discipline.  I have practiced “Trailjournaling” for family and friends on previous trips to Ireland, India, Japan, and Australia as well as several shorter backpacking trips through the years.  What started out as just a test to see if I could stick with the journaling has really paid dividends. After just a few short years, when I would pull out a journal to read or share with someone, I was always amazed at just how much detail I had forgotten of those trips.  Reading them and reliving some of the great memories makes the effort worthwhile.  So here’s hoping to someday come back to Trailjournals to read about MY successful Thru-Hike and relive the forgotten flavor and detail of the adventure!",,View Entry,"Jan 06, Fri",0
McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659851,"“Why don’t you just lose some weight?!?!” - A family friend we lovingly refer to as Belinda


While the above quote might come off as a bit harsh in many settings, it is perfectly acceptable when discussing backpacking gear. Although I’m not a gram weenie or an ultralight backpacker, I very much appreciate the advantages of having lighter equipment. They say that you pack your fears, so if I can have lighter gear covering the basics, I can pack more items to stay warm (my fear that I’m packing) and still end up at a reasonable pack weight. 


I have been backpacking for over 40 years and have carried much heavier gear, but those were MUCH shorter trips that often entailed backpacking to a spot, setting up camp, and then doing day hikes to climb nearby peaks or explore abandoned mines. Those were camping trips. This, I’m told is a walking trip that you just happen to camp out at night. That is why pack weight  seems to be such an important component of eventual success. 


From my decades of backpacking, I have accumulated enough gear to fill our safe room and turn it into my camping closet. The evolution of camping gear in this collection is like a trip through time. While all of it is well used and well loved, it is not all well suited for this particular endeavor.  So I have purchased many new lighter-weight items for my Thru-Hike. 
Backpack- The large Gregory backpack I had most recently been using was great, but the Hyperlite Mountain Gear  Junction backpack is a more suitable size for the Appalachian Trail, made of a waterproof material with a roll-top design (important on a typically wet trail), and at 2.5 pounds, it is 2.7 pounds lighter than the Gregory. 


Tent- I recall camping out in the backyard as a kid in a heavy canvas pup tent with broom handles for poles.  I remember the excitement of finding the 16 pound Walrus Oasis tent that I could lug up the mountain for our whole family to sleep in. The 6 tents currently in my camping closet represent improvements in design, materials, and weight savings. For this trip I purchased a Zpacks Duplex. Topping the scales at 1.25 pounds, it is my first “trekking pole” tent and saves me 1.5 pounds from the Big Agnes tent I had most recently used.  The Duplex is also made of Dyneema waterproof material which eliminates the need for a separate rain fly. The acknowledged downside to this tent is the possibility of condensation in it. So far I have not experienced that when using the new tent. 


Sleeping Bag- The 9 sleeping bags hanging in the camping closet cover a wide range of weights and comfort levels. I remember getting my first Army surplus 6 pound, feather mummy bag. My sister would tell you that it was a great improvement from the bags that it replaced, because although not light, it would keep you from freezing to death unlike the polyester sleepover bag she was using at the time. I still have the -10° LL Bean bag that was one of my first adult purchases as a newly married person with a real paycheck. I have the 35° North Face down mummy bag that I originally bought to take Explorer Scouts on a 2 week backpacking trip to Philmont Scout Ranch in the mountains of New Mexico.  Also hanging in the camping closet is the 0° Campmor down mummy bag that I have been using most recently. This bag was the leading candidate to make the AT trip until I bought the Western Mountaineering Versalite 10° down mummy bag, which I hope hits the sweet spot of comfortable sleeping. At 2.25 pounds, this saved me just over another pound. 


So, as Belinda suggests, I did just lose some weight. With the upgrades to the Big 3, I saved over 5 pounds. That may not sound like a lot. Unless you’re carrying it. On your back. Every day. For 2,200 miles!",,View Entry,"Jan 15, Sun",0
McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659924,"“The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” -Franklin D. Roosevelt 
When talking about the Appalachian Trail, many people ask, “Are you taking a gun?”  I, like virtually all of the thru-hikers I’ve heard of, am not. There are many reasons for this decision. Legally, only 8 of the 14 states the trail runs through have reciprocity with my state’s concealed carry license. Practically, I wouldn’t want to carry the extra weight for 2,200 miles. Optimistically, the trail community is made up of great people, and by reputation is safer than the non-trail world. This is not to say that there aren’t things I’m concerned about.  In fact, for some time I have said that my top 5 fears on the trail are: 1-Lightning 2-Ticks 3-Snakes 4-Bears 5-Crazy People.
I have had a healthy respect for lightning since hearing the low rumble of thunder heading my way after summiting one of Colorado’s fourteeners with my family on what had been a sunny, blue-sky day. As we hastily headed down to the relative protection of the tree-line, the thunder crashed louder and we moved swifter. Eventually ignoring the switchbacks, we raced down the mountain and reached our tent in the wooded valley before the lightning arrived.  On another occasion while out with friends for a long training ride, a thunderstorm moved in on us. Nothing has ever motivated me to bike faster than the lightning bolts hitting in the pastures just beyond the fence line!


Ticks seem to be abundant on the AT and I’ve heard many stories of people’s thru-hike coming to an end because of Lyme disease caused by a tick bite. In efforts to prevent this outcome, I have sent my hiking shirts, pants, and socks to Insect Shield to have them treated with bug repellent that will last for 70 washings. It’s safe to say that on the AT, my clothes won’t be washed 70 times. Additionally, I will be spraying my shoes and gear with Permethrin approximately monthly and using a suitable insect repellent on my body when needed. If my attempts at prevention fail, I will move on to treatment with the doxycycline that my doctor prescribed for me to take with me. 


I’m not a big fan of snakes in most circumstances, but at home I have a really good herpetologist friend that loves them. When a snake visits my house, I give him a quick call and he comes and relocates the snake. I will miss that service on the trail. When surprised by a snake on the trail, I suspect that I will do a very spirited snake dance and then once I regain my composure I will take out my phone to snap a picture before I walk very wide around it as I head on up the trail. Most of the snakes I have seen people encounter on the trail have been long black snakes, but I have seen people walk up on both rattlesnakes and copperheads. Fortunately of all the hikers I’ve followed over the last 10 years, I’ve never seen one have a bad encounter with a snake. I hope to keep that streak going. 


While bears made my fear list, unlike everything else on the list, I hope to see a bear. I just want that encounter to be from a safe distance, only long enough to get a photograph, and not involve my food. The bears on the Appalachian Trail are black bears, so I will not be carrying bear spray like I did when hiking in the grizzly bear territory of Glacier National Park. I will however, each night be hanging my food in a bear bag, or bear piñata as I like to call it. I will not be sleeping with Twizzlers in my pillowcase on the AT. 


When I’ve told people that one of my fears is crazy people, several have shared their opinion that EVERYONE that chooses to walk 2,200 miles carrying 30 pounds on their back while living out in the elements for 6 months IS a crazy person. That is definitely a valid point, but I am thinking more along the lines of the violent person on the trail a few years ago carrying a machete. In a culture of people that trim their toothbrush handles to save weight, the fact that a person would carry the additional weight of a machete would give me the urge to put a lot of distance between us. 


While my list of fears will certainly evolve, I’m interested in what would make your list. Feel free to leave a comment in the guestbook of things I should or shouldn’t fear on a thru-hike.",,View Entry,"Jan 21, Sat",0
McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659967,"“And since we’ve no place to go, Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.” -Sammy Cahn 


In my part of the world, we don’t get a lot of measurable snowfall, so the 6 inches of snow we got this week was an unexpected treat. It gave me the opportunity to practice a few skills like setting up the new tent in the snow, sleeping in the snow, and hiking in the snow. 
This was the first time I set up the Duplex, a trekking pole tent, in the snow. I thought that honor would probably happen in mid-March in the Smoky Mountains. Since the snow was falling about an inch an hour at that point, I tried to set it up quickly to keep snow from getting inside. I was successful with that, but probably should have taken a bit more time to make sure the ridge line was taut and all of the stakes were firmly anchored in the ground. 


I did sleep toasty warm, wearing my Smartwool base layers inside my 10° down sleeping bag. As I was sitting in the tent getting things out of my pack, I was grateful that I would be sleeping on an insulated Thermarest sleeping pad. Otherwise, the snow under the tent would quickly steal the warmth out of my body. This warm setup made a great place to take a ZOOM meeting that I had scheduled for the next morning.The snowy hike also gave me another chance to test out some equipment that I haven’t used much. I used my REI low gaiters to keep snow from falling into my trail runner shoes. I purchased the gaiters with the intention of using them to keep pebbles out of my shoes, but this seemed like a good application also. 


I was able to use my lightweight backpacking umbrella which did a great job of keeping the snow off of my glasses and keeping it off of the top of my backpack. I do need to make some adjustments to the hands-free attachment that secures it to my shoulder strap, which allows me to hike while still using my trekking poles. I will work on keeping the umbrella up a little higher to give me better visibility ahead on the trail. 


I also was able to hike 6 miles in my Sealskinz waterproof socks. I had only used the Sealskinz socks one other time and it was a complete failure. I used them for a couple of water crossings on the Little Missouri River during a previous backpacking trip. I took off my dry socks and my insoles out of my trail runners. I walked across the river in the Sealskinz, sock liners, and shoes. The water was up over my knees and the socks only came to my calves. So naturally they filled with water and soaked my sock liners in the process. That was 100% user error!   This time was MUCH better. I wore my Injinji sock liners under them and was very pleased that the neoprene socks didn’t irritate or blister my feet, that my feet stayed warm, and that even though my shoes and the outside of the socks were wet from walking through slush and snow, my feet and sock liners stayed completely dry. 


So since it’s not time to leave for the Appalachian Trail yet, I’m glad I was able to use this snow day to get in some good training.",,View Entry,"Jan 26, Thu",0

Well it’s February, the month I finally start the trail.  


As an added way for people to stay engaged with the Trailjournal, I made “Trail BINGO” cards. These are 75 things that I should experience, places I should walk to, or animals I should encounter. A website then randomized them into 30 individual BINGO cards. I have already given out many of the cards to family, friends, and coworkers but I still have a few more. So, if you see me, just ask for one. OR, in theory, this link should take you to the website where you can print your own:
  https://mfbc.us/m/kz5zxbw


If you guys can keep me on the trail until I complete the Thru Hike in Maine, nearly everyone should have a blacked-out BINGO card. (Except possibly the people that have seeing a moose on their card. I really hope to see one, but they are a lot more scarce than seeing a bear.)


The first question I got when I started handing out the cards was “what are the prizes?”.  That’s a great question. I really hadn’t thought that far in advance. 😁 I kind of thought that the thrill of playing would be reward enough. 🤣  SO, sparing no expense, I bought some high quality refrigerator magnets of the plaque on Springer Mountain for the 1st BINGO and the sign on Mt. Katahdin for the 1st Black-Out BINGO.  I have 1 set of prizes for family, a set for former coworkers, and a set for friends. 


So if there are prizes, I guess there should be rules. 1- I have to actually experience it, not just type the word. (ex. For “BEAR” I have to actually blog about seeing a bear, not just say I hung my bear bag last night.) 2- Note the date of the journal entry on the square when you mark it off. (That will keep people from having to fact check you.😁)  3- comment in my Trailjournal Guest Book when you BINGO with which squares you used or attach a picture of your card if possible. (The comments are recorded in time order, so we can see who is first.)  Let me know if you think there are other bases that need to be covered. 


Also hang on to your completed cards. At the conclusion of a successful Thru Hike, I will have a drawing for a better prize that I will have 6 months to think of. 


So go on over to the guest book and get familiar with it.  You can even leave suggestions for  grand prize.  I hope you will all follow along and find it entertaining and informative.  In the end, we’ll ALL be winners!",,View Entry,"Feb 03, Fri",0

TheOkie and I decided we would benefit from a training hike before we head out to the Appalachian Trail. I had joined a group in November for a 28 mile loop in the mountains of Arkansas and thought this would be a good last training trip for us. The forecast of rain would also allow us to train on specific skills needed for the AT.
After a night at the Ozark Inn, Mena’s finest 2 star accommodations (I personally would have given them 2 1/2 stars except you could hear every word from the adjacent room and I wound up sleeping with ear plugs) we drove to the Little Missouri Falls trailhead.  A forest service employee drove up and urged us to be cautious in light of the anticipated rainfall and the rivers we have to cross.   We agreed and after trying to send a Garmin “heading out” message to our loved ones we hit the trail. For most of the day rain just spit and sprinkled. At 57° and lots of uphill hiking, I eventually shed layers down to my wool t shirt and hiking pants. 


We took the side trail to the Hurricane Knob viewpoint, but the views were pretty greyed out by the rain cloud we were hiking in. Shortly thereafter we had dropped back down to the creek where we settled in for a lunch of tortillas and peanut butter and to filter water. 


Before Brush Heap Mountain, our 4th mountain of the day, the rain had picked up enough to deploy the hands-free backpacking umbrella. I wound up using the umbrella all the way to camp. Camp for the night is the top of Brushy Mountain. Since it is a dry camp, we stopped and filtered water and filled our CNOC water bags to carry .3 miles to our campsite. Since it was still raining, we quickly set up our tents. And since it is on a mountain, we had cell signal and could tell from the radar that the rain was going to be with us for a while. 


Once dry in my rent, I prepared a freezer bag meal of mashed potatoes, brown gravy, and chicken. The warm meal hit the spot after being rain cooled for the evening. Then it was time to call it a night after an 11.3 mile day. 


On day 1, we were able to train on using our Garmin devices for tracking and messaging, our FarOut navigation apps, and following a white-blazed trail.  We trained on hiking up and down mountains, adjusting clothing layers for the changing conditions, using the hiking umbrellas, and rock hopping across streams (mostly successfully).  We trained on setting up camp in the rain, filtering water and preparing meals in a tent. All of these things we trained on will be useful skills in becoming a thru hiker.",,View Entry,"Feb 08, Wed",0

Camping up on a mountain and having cell service proved very helpful.  A quick google search of the Little Missouri River height showed that the river I had forded in November that was just above my knees had risen NINE FEET since yesterday. Since there will be no ferryman waiting there in a canoe, like there will be when we cross the Kennebec River, we decided to turn around. It seems this trip, the Eagle Rock Loop trail will just have to be the Eagle Rock Out-And-Back trail.  


We waited for a rare break in the rain and walked downhill to the area where we had walked across the small stream and collected water the evening before.  The rocks we had easily navigated were nowhere to be seen. In their place were whitewater rapids. Since we didn’t have Moses’ staff to part the waters and since we didn’t really want to chase our gear or each other to the Gulf of Mexico, we decided that today would be one of the very rare on-trail zero days. So we headed back uphill to camp, stopping to collect some water from a cleaner runoff stream that had just popped up overnight. 


Once on the trail, a zero day, a day that we would hike zero miles, would typically be taken in a town or at a hostel. The day would be spent doing hiker chores such as resupplying food, laundering clothes, showering, resting, and eating LOTS of town food. Our zero day consisted of LOTS of resting in our tent listening to the pouring rain and eating a little food. I didn’t eat all of the meals I had brought for the day partially to ration it since we don’t know how long it will take for the water to recede to a safe level and partially because hanging out in a tent doesn’t build up much of an appetite. 


One of the great things about backpacking is self sufficiency. Even though we were technically stranded, we were warm, dry, fed, and rested.  There was no hint of panic, just a change of plans we would need to adapt to. And as a bonus, we had cell signal and could let our loved ones know we were fine. 


So in a rare display of good judgement we decided to hold tight and see if the waters will provide an escape path tomorrow. We decided to turn around and not drown.",,View Entry,"Feb 09, Thu",0

Well the format of the trip didn’t exactly go the way we had planned, but we made it home safely, eventually. We had not planned on flash flooding cutting us off, nor had we planned on extra excitement on the drive home, but those were just OUR plans. 


It had continued to rain into the evening hours, but became lighter and lighter until it eventually stopped. Once it was safe to cross the rain swollen creek, OUR plan was to hike 2 1/2 miles back to the last road we had crossed and road walk 14 miles back to the car. A good friend with lots of knowledge about this area had called the rangers and then called us to share the information that one of the bridges that our road walk would cross was still 7 feet under water. That didn’t seem ideal. So OUR plan became to walk as far as we could and then set up camp until we could safely pass. Thanks to the campsite with cell signal, each time I woke up in the night I was able to check and see that the level of the flood waters was receding fairly quickly. I began to think we had a chance of hiking out in the morning.
Morning came to the loud noises of a bird squawking over our camp. (Later when hiking, TheOkie and I both recalled wondering if that bird had a freshly plucked olive leaf in its mouth!)  We each packed up our Zpacks tents that had faithfully kept us and our belongings dry through over 24 hours of flooding rainfall. 


When everything was back in our backpacks, we headed the .3 miles downhill to our first stream crossing. The conversation on the way down was what conditions would we be wiling to cross in. In an answer to prayer, when we got to the stream the water was lower, slower, and clearer than the day before. We could see the bottom and knew there was a path that wasn’t over knee deep. We switched into our water shoes, unbuckled our hip belts, and quickly waded across the chilly stream. This gave us a lot of optimism about the day. 


At the first road crossing we had to decide between attempting to road walk back or attempting to hike back on the trail we came in on. The stream at the road crossing was the largest stream we would have to ford if we took the trail back. It was wider, but not much over knee high, so we felt it was a safe option to take the trail. 


On the hike back we crossed many streams. Some in our water shoes, some by rock hopping in our hiking shoes, and some by attempting to rock hop in our accidentally soaked hiking shoes. We stopped for lunch at the scenic overlook of Hurricane Knob and finally had a beautiful view of the surrounding mountains. During lunch we saw our first human in 2 days. It was a backpacker that was hiking those rocky trails in sandals. It made my feet hurt just thinking about it. We made good time from that point on, as the trail was mostly flat or downhill the last 4 miles. 


Once we reached the trailhead, we hiked on over to see the actual Little Missouri Falls. With all of the recent rainfall, the falls were roaring!  We walked back to the car and loaded up. OUR plan was to grab a bite to eat in Mena and have an uneventful drive home discussing the things we had learned from this training trip. 


As I drove away from the trailhead, I took a wrong turn. (I needed white blazes to lead me back to Mena.) We went from remote backwoods Arkansas to remoter backwoods Arkansas on a maintained dirt road that had suffered a little damage from the floods. The narrow road twisted through the mountains, which was fine until a warning light came on that we had a tire losing pressure. As it dropped below 10 pounds, the road opened up into the first flat area we had seen in a while. I was grateful to have a safe place to pull over, I was grateful it was still light out, I was grateful to have a full size spare, but I was most grateful to have TheOkie with me. He was like having a NASCAR pit crew. We got the tire changed, everything loaded back up, and made it in to Mena where we attacked some double quarter-pounder burgers. Then we had a nice ride home discussing OUR plans for hitting the Appalachian Trail at the end of this month. 


So this trip didn’t go how we had planned it, but it turned out great. We hiked in a beautiful area, gained confidence for our upcoming hike, and returned home safely.",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Fri",0

I woke up at 5:00 this morning with my mind racing. I felt like a kid anxiously awaiting Christmas morning, but that’s 10 months away so it must be something else. Maybe it’s that I’m leaving in 2 days for the big 6 month long trip that I’ve been preparing for and planning on for almost 10 years.  
As my mind raced through the calculations of what food to pack until the first resupply, taking into account the spacing of the shelters and the throttled back mileage that we promise ourselves that we will start out doing, I couldn’t get my brain to shut off. After all, you have to balance food preference with weight and the availability of your favorites on trail. You also have to decide what all you include in your first aid kit. I know someone could take a nasty fall on the trail and you would want to be prepared, but if you take extra things you don’t use, that adds up to extra weight you carry for 2,200 miles. There’s sunscreen and bug spray that you may not need day 1, but if you don’t bring it now, when will you get it?  So many decisions. So many things to pack, unpack, and repack these last 2 days. 
I’ve had my last Folger burger and said my last goodbyes to former coworkers and friends. I’m having breakfast with my daughter this morning, and dinner this evening with great next door neighbors that keep watch over our house. I’m thrilled that my wife will be able to take me to the trail and even hike the falls section of the approach trail with me. 
So, I’m just ready to get on the road. At that point, I will have fewer decisions and my brain should have less calculations to keep me up.",,View Entry,"Feb 25, Sat",0

I did a pack shakedown and started taking out items that I “MIGHT” need like an EXTRA phone charging cable, EXTRA duct tape, and various other EXTRAS. I also took out a few excess snacks and a meal that would be for emergencies only. When I re-weighed the pack, it came in under what I had originally been expecting.

At 4:00 am the alarm went off and we were off to pick up TheOkie and his wife and head to Georgia and the start of the Appalachian Trail. Once we hit I-40 we made really good time. We were treated to a beautiful sun ball and didn’t have to stop until we got to Memphis. After filling up with gas and Subway sandwiches, we were quickly heading east again. As the day went on, truck traffic really picked up. Things were still pretty good until we got near Chattanooga. The rains caused a lot of stop and go interstate traffic, but they also provided us a beautiful rainbow. 
From Chattanooga on, I kept flashing back to my childhood as I lived in northern Georgia from 1st-3rd grade. To see the Rock City and Ruby Falls signs plastered everywhere really took me back in time, as did seeing so many familiar place names on the signs including Varnell, where I lived. 
We made our second stop of the day in Ellijay where we again got gas and pulled through Chick-fil-A. My travel companions were real road warriors!  We made it door to door in under 14 hours, not bad for 875 miles. 
From Ellijay to Amicalola Falls lodge is a steep and winding road. When we turned in to the Amicalola park there was a sign that said the road had up to a 15° grade to it. We look what seemed straight up and could see the lights of the lodge. Where we were and what we saw are connected by the first mile or so of the Approach Trail that we will be hiking in the morning. Talk about starting you off in the deep end!
When we got to the lodge we were greeted by the 3rd hiker in our group. He and his sister had driven in earlier today after sensibly making it a multi-day trip from his home in Kansas. He had also brought each of us a nice AT logo that we can attach to our pack and in the future use it for a Christmas ornament. Very nice.

“A journey of 2,198.4 miles must begin with a picture of the plaque on Springer Mountain.”- McDuck
My wife and I woke up early in our room at the Amicalola Falls Lodge and joined TheOkie and his wife as well as our Kansas friend and his sister, for breakfast when the buffet opened. Then we grabbed our packs and all crammed in the sister’s car and headed down the hill to where the hiker check-in is temporarily housed while the  amazing new visitor center is being constructed. 
Once inside  we weighed our packs, signed in, were assigned our thru hiker numbers (589, 590, & 591), and were given our thru-hiker tags.  Then we listened to the very nice  Georgia Appalachian Trail Club volunteers’ presentation on the importance of “Leave No Trace” camping principles. 
We then walked a short distance to take pictures at “The Arch”, the iconic beginning of the approach trail. We all hiked up past the beautiful Amicalola Falls including the 600 stairs. At this point, I was very glad I had been hiking my backpack up the amphitheater steps back home on a regular basis. 
After the falls, the trail split and my wife and TheOkie’s wife headed back to the lodge and to the car. The other 4 of us continued on hiking the 8.8 mile approach trail. We made really good time passing and briefly visiting with many other thru hikers on a day of absolutely perfect weather. 
Even though the approach trail is relatively short, it is an hour long car ride winding through the narrow mountain roads to get to the closest parking area to the top of Springer Mountain and the start of the actual Appalachian Trail. Our wives drove to this parking area and hiked 1 mile south on the AT and met us at the plaque  at the official trail start. Their timing was perfect and we were able to take lots of pictures to commemorate the special occasion of kicking off our thru hikes. After all of the traditional pictures were taken, we all 6 hiked the 1st northbound mile of the actual Appalachian Trail together. So even though we hiked 9.8 miles today, it only counts as 1 official trail mile. So it is the longest mile on the trail. Once back to the car, we crammed the 6 bodies and 3 backpacks in and headed down the forest service road. 
I’m so thankful that my wife has been able to come out with me for the start of the hike. She is a great hiker and today was also a great shuttle driver. As we reached civilization and drove past some spectacular farms and scenery, she pulled in to Mack Aaron’s Apple House, a large touristy emporium of all things apple (the fruit, not the tech). In our hungry state we bought apples, apple cider, apple donuts, and fried pies. Those hiking calories aren’t just going to replace themselves!  
Once back at the lodge, we got cleaned up and sat out on the balcony in the sun taking in the views and visiting about the day’s success. Then we went in and attacked the dinner buffet with multiple plates of goodies. Finally we headed back out on the balcony to take in a beautiful sunset over the mountains. 
I know that every day on this adventure can’t be perfect, but I’m so glad that Day 1 was, even if it contained the longest mile of the Appalachian Trail.","Approach Trail

“How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.” - Winnie The Pooh
While Day 1 was perfect, Day 2 didn’t start off that way. After breakfast in the lodge, it was time for the wives to head back home. I’ve known for years that saying goodbye to my childhood sweetheart and beautiful wife of 37 years would be the hardest part of my journey. She is a strong, self-sufficient woman who will be fine without me at home for a while, but life is just so much better with her by my side. I know that she will be back out next month to see me(and the ponies in the Grayson Highlands), so that helps. 
After they departed, Linda took us the scenic route back to the Springer Mountain trailhead. We only had to make a couple of stops to accommodate Jeff’s anxiousness. Linda delivered us safely and watched us walk away into the woods.
 The trail today was nice and scenic, the weather was great, and we only had 7.1 miles to go to Hawk Mountain shelter our destination for the day. On 3 separate occasions we encountered soldiers running down the trail toward us. One carrying a blue rifle, one carrying a blue sledge hammer, and one carrying nothing in his hands, but they were all wearing very large heavy backpacks. They were members of the Army Ranger Mountain School which conducts exercises throughout this section of the trail.
Also this morning, just after a river crossing at Three Forks, we encountered our first Trail Magic!  A nice gentlemen was parked beside the trail with the bed of his pickup loaded with an assortment of donuts , snack bars, and other treats to give to the passing hikers. The Apple fritter was great, but the kindness of a stranger made me feel even better. Jeff and TheOkie agreed completely, but one “trail ambassador” that happened to be there at the same time chastised the good Samaritan telling him that if hikers had thousands of dollars for gear and thousands of dollars to pay for a thru hike, they didn’t need to receive free snacks. I think that gentleman completely missed the point!  Although all 3 of us are carrying more snacks than we could possibly eat before our next resupply, we all appreciated the trail angel’s generosity. He felt good to be able to give to others and we felt good to know that there are people out there that are kind to traveling strangers. 
Lunch today was tuna packets on flour tortillas. I have tried a variety of the tuna flavors and so far have enjoyed them all. Supper was several packs of peanut butter crackers and a few other items from my snack bag that doesn’t seem to be shrinking. 
The shelter is a unique double decker structure that is designed to hold 12 hikers including the loft area. Also there are sites to pitch tents, a short path to a flowing stream for water, and a privy. Other than the tent sites, I took advantage of all of their amenities. My privy experience today was not that bad, in fact it was far better than the alternative of digging a cat hole. I appreciate the volunteers that provide all of the structures we enjoy the length of the trail. We decided to stay in the shelter for several reasons, primarily because it is expected to rain throughout the night and we won’t have to take down and pack up wet tents in the morning. As the evening went on the shelter became packed with people. There is certainly a variety of characters present for our first shelter experience!","FS 42 Parking Lot

At our orientation Tuesday, we were urged to hike from shelter area to shelter area through Georgia. The shelters are spaced approximately 8 miles apart and all have a water source, a privy, and a bear box or bear cables to safely store your food. We later heard the phrase from the “Ramdino Thru Hiker Update”, Don’t Hate The 8, urging us to embrace the lower mileage days until our knees and muscles get used to the constant hiking up and down mountains.  So today’s hike was “only” 7.6 miles from the Hawk Mountain Shelter to the Gooch Gap Shelter at mile 15.7. Soon enough we will need to increase our mileage, but for now we are enjoying getting to the shelter early, getting our equipment set up, having lunch and visiting with the hikers that are on our same pace this mornings hike was mostly through a foggy drizzle, sweating in a T-shirt with the humidity. At one point is started raining enough to pull out the lightweight umbrella for a few minutes we were treated to one of the cool sights of the trail when we would go up a mountain and see the other mountaintops sticking up like islands above the thick sea of white fog of the valleys below.  I tried to capture a picture of this, but none really did it justice. We covered our miles very efficiently as Jeff took the lead today and kept us at a nice pace. Although people left at various times, there were only two other hikers at the shelter when we arrived, ensuring us of dry space for the coming rain. The Gooch Gap Shelter is another very nice two story shelter with a large covered area attached to the front, with a picnic table  for meals and socializing. 
I tried to do a better job of eating today and knock out some of that food bag weight. For lunch I had two packets of chicken added to the special ramen that my daughter sent with me. It was warm, filling, & delicious. For supper I had packets of mashed potatoes, gravy, & chicken. It was a struggle to finish it all, but I knew I needed the calories and protein. 
A few of the hikers in our mini-bubble are: Pink Draggin’, the consensus chairman of the entertainment committee, harmonica enthusiast, inventor of the thumbooty, master of tribal illuminescence, and a friendly soul that would offer to share anything he has with anyone and quite often does. Colby who has a YouTube channel called Freedom Foraging. Freyja who is documenting her thru hike for “The Trek”. Cuss Mustard who is good to add intelligent humor to the conversations. And Chris a retired Army ranger who actually went through the Ranger Mountain Training in this area. 
I honestly didn’t think we would spend 2 nights in shelters in first 2 months on trail, but here we are. On the plus side, it has been VERY entertaining and we haven’t had to pack up a wet tent. On the minus side, I slept VERY close to a snorer and a mouse chewed a hole in my sleeping bag. I had placed all of my food and smellables in the bear box, but the mouse decided to take home some quality down insulation to insulate their nest. 
We also experienced another first today when we met Lily the ridgerunner and Sarah from the ATC. Lily came back to camp in the shelter area and was friendly and informative.
After several musical offerings at the shelter through the day, the evening’s entertainment was capped off by Pink’s laser light show in the woods. We will definitely never forget some of the characters we have met in our first week!
So while we have hiked bigger miles on previous outings, we aren’t hating the eight. We know that consistent efforts will lead to our eventual success.

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660421,"“When it’s raining, you can be wet and miserable or you can just be wet.” -MalaThis morning when the shelter came alive, it was different. The first 3 days, most of this group had been hiking the same miles and ending up together. With a day of rain and potential storms in the forecast some people arranged for a shuttle to pick them up and take them to a hostel to ride out the weather,    some people decided to hike the 15.6 miles to Neels Gap where there is an outfitter that you can resupply at, and we decided to hike the 8.2 miles to Lance Creek tentsites and camp there to keep around our 8 mile a day “warm-up” period. These were the three major options because about 2 miles past where we decided to camp starts a zone of no camping until Neels Gap due to bear activity (unless you are carrying a bear canister, which we aren’t).
So we started off walking into the very dense fog that was spitting a little drizzle at us. We quickly warmed up and took off our raincoats as we continued to walk in the cloud. We met 2 local day hikers coming down the trail towards us. They told us that this section had the most scenic views in northern Georgia. We had to take there word for it, because at one point we picked out a big tree as far away as we could see and counted the paces needed to reach it. We could see something that large, 25 paces away. Every time we came to a rock outcropping that opened up to the side of the very steep cliffs, we just had to imagine the scenic beauty because all we saw was fog. Eventually as we climbed higher into the rain cloud, it started actually raining a cold rain on us. So we stopped and put our rain jackets on and strapped our umbrellas to our shoulder straps and hiked on. At Woody Gap, we came across Happy and the young sisters, OH & IO waiting for Cuss Mustard and their shuttle to take them to a hostel. While we were standing there visiting by the first trash can we had seen on the trail since day 1, a car pulled up offering trail magic of fresh fruit and making sure everyone was ok and if anyone needed a ride. Honestly as bad as the visibility was, I was surprised anyone would drive up into that cloud.  Then it was time to head back into the woods. That proved to be a little challenge since you could barely see from one side of the road to the other. Once across, we found a path and were quite relieved to see a white blaze on one of the first trees. 
We continued hiking up higher and higher. Near the top, we stopped to visit with 2 ladies out doing some hiking for the weekend.  We quickly had to get moving again before the gusting winds sent our umbrellas flying off the mountain with us still attached.  We kept hiking through the rain, the puddles, and the mud and were all having a great time. Finally we made it to camp and a ridgerunner named Moxie had just stopped there for lunch. As the rain slowed, we visited with her and then quickly set up our tents, preparing for the approaching storms.  Once safely in my dry tent, I was happy to see that we had a tiny bit of cell service. I quickly checked in with the family and returned a few texts. I received a notification on my phone that we were in a tornado watch. I felt right at home except I knew I couldn’t just walk downstairs to the basement and go into the safe room. So, I did the next best thing and texted my daughter, today’s chief AT meteorologist, to see the timeline of the storm and how the radar looked.  She was a great help letting me know what to expect and when it was all clear. In an answer to prayer, the worst split around us and we all stayed safe and dry in our tents even though there was a pond under and around mine. Eventually we emerged to have dinner, brush our teeth, and hang our bear bags from the cable system provided at the campsite.
Today we passed the 1% of the trail mark.  Just watch that needle move!  Tomorrow we have a big climb over Blood Mountain and into Neels Gap where we will resupply food and probably get a cabin for the night to clean ourselves and our gear. Although today we hiked in the rain, but we were just wet. We are having a blast so far!","Gooch Gap Shelter

This morning, just after sunrise, we got our bear bags full of food off of the bear cables (permanent pulley systems that keep your food out of the reach of bears) and had a quick breakfast. Soon we had packed our tents away even though their bottoms were wet and a bit muddy and started hiking
Being a weekend, there was a lot of non-thru-hiker activity on the trail. We stopped and talked to Bad Camel who thru hiked in 2014 and liked the mountains of the trail so much they got a cabin near here. She was out walking her doodle and they both were super friendly.  Next, two guys came up on us trail running and stopped for a brief visit. They were doing the Georgia loop today which is 60 miles through these steep mountains. They said they hoped to finish by 2 am and soon they were off and out of sight. Next we met Whisper who thru hiked in 2019. One common theme has been that all of these former thru hikers have been so kind and encouraging.  We also met a crew of trail maintainers. These volunteers lug heavy saws, pulleys, and other equipment up and down the mountains to remove trees that are blown down in the storms like yesterday and do whatever is needed to keep the trail in great shape. We let them know how much we appreciate their efforts. Then we ran across Moxie, the ridge runner we visited with yesterday. The ridge runners are employees of the ATC - Appalachian Trail Conservancy, and are assigned sections of the trail to make sure hikers know proper “Leave No Trace” backpacking principles and provide information to the hikers.
  Through the years, I have heard thru hikers say that they could smell day hikers before they saw them. Today, we can confirm that is true. I think that may have more to do with the frequency that they shower, do laundry, and use deodorant, but it was funny to us that it was noticeable. To be fair, there’s a good chance that they smelled us coming from a fair distance for the opposite reasons. 
Before 11:00 we had reached the summit of Blood Mountain, our biggest climb of the day. We stopped into the iconic enclosed, stone shelter to put on some layers we had stripped off in the heat of the climb. Then we climbed up the adjacent rocks for the best views we have seen this trip. You could see layers and layers of mountains just rolling out to the horizon. At one point we noticed we could see the Atlanta skyline that is about 100 miles away. Quite a difference from yesterday’s 25 yard foggy views. We really couldn’t have had better weather than today. Moxie joined us as we had a snack and a short rest and she offered to take our picture so we could all three be in it. So we climbed back down to the stone shelter and after a few pictures we were on our way down. We met a pretty good stream of people as we headed down and we stopped and visited with several who were curious about thru hikers.
From the top of the mountain, all the way down, we could hear the screaming engines of cars and motorcycles racing through the incredibly curvy mountain roads surrounding us. I’m not sure if they are always here or if the great weekend weather brought them out, but it was pretty crazy. 
When we got to the bottom of the mountain we were at Neels Gap and the famous Mountain Crossings, an outfitter where you can resupply food and replace shoes or gear if you need it. It is famous for several reasons. It is the only building on the entire trail, that the official trail actually goes THROUGH.  Also, there is a giant old tree at the edge of their parking lot with hundreds of pairs of boots and shoes hanging from it.  A surprising number of people decide lugging a heavy pack up and down the steep mountains isn’t for them. This is the first point of civilization they can call it quits, so traditionally they signify it by throwing their hiking shoes up into they tree. We all three gladly kept our shoes!
It was a special day at Mountain Crossings, as the Physical Therapy department of The University of North Georgia was having a service day. Their instructors and students were not only providing all kinds of trail magic treats, but they were giving massages and working on hikers’ aches and pains.  You couldn’t have met a nicer group of people and we enjoyed joking around with them for quite a while. 
We arranged to rent a cabin at the Blood Mountain Cabins and walked the .3 miles downhill to check in. After putting on an odd assortment of clothes that we didn’t need to launder, we took all of our other clothes back uphill the .3 miles and did laundry while we shopped for our food for the next 4 days until we can get to another town. Resupplying food is still a little tricky for us. You don’t want to buy too much and carry the extra weight, but you don’t want to buy too little and go hungry with nowhere else to get food before the next town. One other thing we did at Mountain Crossings was order a frozen pizza. I can’t remember the last time I had a frozen pizza, but I will never forget this one. I had a hot, delicious Red Barron Brick-Oven-Crust Pepperoni pizza and a Mr. Pibb. It was gone in seconds. I’m not complaining about my dehydrated backpacking meals, but there is certainly a difference in hot, real food. 
While we were there Pink Draggin’ and Freyja came in. They had gone to a hostel yesterday to ride out the storm. A nice couple from Maine that we have camped with the last few days dropped in, and we saw and visited with Moxie for the third time of the day. 
Finally when our clothes were dry we walked back down the hill to our cabin again. The shower felt great, our clothes are clean, tomorrow people will think we are day hikers!","Lance Creek Tentsite

At 11.5 “trail miles”, today was our longest hiking day so far. Not because we are abandoning the eights, but because that was the most appropriate shelter site for us to get to. We left Blood Mountain Cabins a little earlier than usual and walked past the tree of shoes and through the building at Mountain Crossings. As we started uphill we ran into our old friends Pink Draggin’ and Colby Jack who were breaking camp. A little farther, we came across Moxie along with the sisters OH & IO having breakfast. We had two giant climbs today and I no longer have to worry about smelling like a day hiker. 
The highlight of the day was when we descended into Hogpen Gap and saw jugs of water sitting out. We were excited for the chance to fill our water bottle’s and hiked across the road. As we walked another 50 yards, we saw people setting up a pop up tent and lots of lawn chairs. As we approached, they enthusiastically told us they were setting up a hiker buffet and invited us to stay. That was not a hard sell!
We dropped our packs and began helping them remove items from their vehicle. That thing was loaded down like Mary Poppins’ bag!  They had the most thorough and highly organized setup you could imagine. They had charging devices, a hiker box full of all kinds of gear and resupply items for the taking. They had hot drinks, cold drinks, sports drinks, soups, salads, sandwiches, desserts, fruits, snacks, socks, hats, bandanas, hiking poles, and more. Their names are Mitzi & Bobby and MICHELLE!!! & Barry. They live in the area and for years have set up this entire elaborate operation they call the Hogpen Café every Saturday and Sunday from February to April to catch the large bubble of Northbound (NOBO) hikers starting out. They do this because when Bobby was diagnosed with cancer, he hiked up onto a local section of the AT where God said that He would take care of Bobby and wanted Bobby to take care of hikers. Bobby is cancer free and has been taking care of hikers ever since. The term Trail Angel is used a lot on the AT, but never more appropriately than when referring to this group of angels. They not only nourish the hiker’s bodies, but also nourish their souls by praying with them and for them. They are the most welcoming, giving, sincere, nonjudgmental examples of Christ’s love you will run across. They truly are Angels among us.","Neels Gap

Today we crossed the 50 mile mark which I guess would be a semi-milestone. We have now completed just over 2% of the miles. Mathematically it would suggest that it would take us 50 weeks to complete the trail, not the 6 months that we are allocating.  However, we aren’t worried because we know that taking this time to allow our bodies to adapt to the consistent ups and downs, will soon allow us to open up our mileage and get to the pace we need.
After a night of earplugs, then earbuds of music, this morning started off getting to pet Atlas, a 4 month old German Shepherd/Husky mix that is hiking with his human, Mark. They had been hammock camping adjacent to my tent. After a quick breakfast, today’s 7.3 mile hike was mostly on an old road bed with gradual grades. MOSTLY. Sprinkled into the mix were a few climbs and a few sections that I would describe as “rock jumbles”. The climbs were much milder than yesterday and the rocky sections were challenging but fun. We will have much bigger of both ahead of us. On the hike, we got to stop and visit with Swanee from Boston and then his hiking partners Joker and Homer.  We met up with Freeze from Florida near the spring below the shelter. 
It was nice to get into camp around 11 this morning and find that there was cell coverage since it has been spotty lately.  That gave me a chance to talk to my lovely wife for a bit. 
At lunch, a nice couple, Slim Jim and his wife Sticks & Stones who are section hiking the trail stopped into the Blue Mountain Shelter for a nice long visit. They will be ending this section of the trail today and heading back to Pennsylvania, so they were offering up snacks to the hungry hikers. We also got to visit with Euchre, a friendly guy from Ohio who is heading north with us, hiking similar mileage. A bit later, Plunger and Avery set up camp near us and Mark and Atlas have made it in. 
After an afternoon tent nap, we are now having dinner and I’m trying my first “real” dehydrated meal of the trip, mushroom risotto. It is definitely more flavorful than the instant mashed potato meals. Soon it will be time to brush teeth, hang the bear piñata from the bear cables, and go to sleep.

I woke up this morning on top of Blue Mountain and was treated to a magical sunrise. It was the best sunrise on trail so far. This came after my best night’s sleep on the trail so far. The sun felt great as we packed up our tents and I had my Cliff Bar breakfast. We headed down from Blue mountain into Unicoi Gap. There we were met with Trail Magic by Smoky Bear, a trail Angel, former thru hiker, and shuttle driver. He had snacks, fruit, and soft drinks sitting out on the hood of his vehicle. He urged us to take all we wanted to help us up the big 1,000 ft climb up Rocky Mountain. I had a banana and a Mountain Dew for second breakfast as we stood there visiting about his hikes and his knowledge of the local area.  In real life, I seldom drink soft drinks, but he said it was Hiker Diesel and would power me up the mountain.  All hyped up on Mountain Dew, I jumped on that climb like a spider monkey. Well, I was at least able to not lag behind our leader today, TheOkie.
Midway up the climb, we ran into Susie, with the trail name Rip, who is a trail maintainer and triple crowner. The triple crown is hiking America’s 3 long distance trails, the AT, the PCT - Pacific Crest Trail, and the CDT - Continental Divide Trail.  As we stood there regaining our oxygen, she told us of grizzly bear encounters and other highlights of hiking the other trails. She said that the black bears found on the AT are just cute, not scary. 
After climbing Rocky Mountain, we descended into Indian Grave gap where we visited with a former thru hiker and then started up Tray mountain. At Tray Gap, mile 56.9 the trail passed a parking lot where we saw a couple of vehicles and a few tents and awnings. Our eyes lit up as a gentleman waived us over. It was Grumpy from Boots Off Hostel in Hampton, Tennessee, and did he and Jim ever have treats in store for us!  I had a bag of chips and a coke as I waited for the chili dogs to finish cooking. After that, the cheeseburger was ready and it was delicious. They had been to the AT Kick Off in Amicalola Falls this weekend along with lots of vendors and trail enthusiasts. They were setting up trail magic along their way back to Tennessee and we happened to pop out at the right place at the right time.  You talk about magical!  They urged us to set up camp there for the evening and they would cook us supper and breakfast before sending us on our way. The three of us have been rotating the lead each day and today, TheOkie was our leader. He is a stronger man than me, because I had already been sucked in to the vortex of fresh-cooked, non-dehydrated food!  But I obediently waddled up the trail after him for the 1.2 mile climb up Tray Mountain to where we are staying tonight at mile 58.1. Before beginning the trail, I had estimated that I would lose 20 pounds on the thru hike. I have now changed my estimate to possibly gaining 20 pounds before I get out of Georgia due to all of the AWESOME trail magic that we have received.  The kindness of strangers really does lift your spirits. 
While Iceman and Dog bone have hiked ahead, Dennis from Iowa, M.B., Plunger, and Avery are camping at Tray Mountain along with us. Dennis had already visited the “piped spring” water source for this camp area and didn’t have a great report. After setting up our tents in a great location with an incredible view of rows and rows of mountains in the distance, we took the blue blazed side trail down the hill to get water for the evening. Dennis was correct. We followed the trickle of a stream down a little way to a point we could collect our water to filter. For the second day in a row, we were lucky that Jeff thought to bring the bottom half of a water bottle to scoop up water from places with a flow too low to get our water bags in. 
I am currently in my tent, too full to think about eating more, looking out across the rows of rolling mountains below us and the smoke from a couple of forest fires on the horizon. I guess it’s ok that TheOkie made us leave the trail magic, because this spot is magical in its own right.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Well, I have to backtrack a bit to last night after I posted my journal. I decided that I needed to eat dinner even though I had indulged in a generous portion of trail magic before I was so rudely taken away by yesterday’s leader, TheOkie. As we were sitting on the rock ledge by our incredible tentsite, I heard a rustle in the leaves and undergrowth just a few feet away. A few times I looked toward the sound and didn’t see anything. And then, there he was, Mousezilla!  The largest mouse I’ve ever seen. I legitimately thought “that must be a rabbit” until he ran across the rock and I saw his long skinny tail. There was no way that thing was still that huge off of last year’s berries, he was living off of hiker food!  Luckily I was able to snap a photo of him, because like Sasquatch, I don’t think TheOkie or Jeff would have believed me. While I was cooking my chicken ramen, Mousezillla came out again and this time TheOkie saw him also, so he can corroborate my story. We were concerned about him chewing on our equipment, but we were more afraid of him dragging one of us off into the woods!  I am happy to report that Mousezilla didn’t chew on our tents. I can also report that all 3 of us think that the sound of our dyneema tent fabric rustling in the breeze sounds exactly like what your imagination would think a mouse chewing on a tent would sound like. All night long.
We woke up this morning in time to catch another spectacular sunrise over the Georgia mountains. After taking in the neon orange display in the sky, I retrieved my bear piñata, took down my tent, had breakfast, re-filled my water bottle, visited the privy, loaded everything in the backpack, strapped on my pack. Then it was time to wait for today’s leader, Jeff to ask “is anyone not ready?” and start walking. This is our new normal morning routine. 
We had a pretty uneventful hike today other than the climb up Kelly Knob. At one point a hiker sped past us hiking in sandals. When we got to the Deep Gap Shelter he was still there having lunch. He was a very friendly New Zealander named Harry.  He is hiking in his sandals due to some irritation that his shoes were causing. After a nice long visit he hiked on and we set up our tents and checked out the shelter. 

The Deep Gap Shelter is the nicest shelter we have seen so far. It is a newer, mostly enclosed two story shelter that sleeps 12 hikers and has a nice porch area and picnic table.
Plunger and Avery later hiked in and were down to 1 ramen between them until they get off trail tomorrow to resupply. All 3 of us raced to give them extra food as it was an opportunity to provide trail magic to fellow hikers and lighten our pack weight a little for tomorrow’s short hike. M B is also here and we were able to visit with him over dinner st the picnic table. Many other new faces have shown up as faster hikers that started later are catching up to us. One special hiker that came bouncing in this afternoon is May. She is a black and white dog that hiked over 14 miles today with her human. 
We have laid out our tentative plans to do a NERO (near zero miles) tomorrow followed by our first ZERO (zero mile day) Friday while we resupply and get ready for North Carolina.","Tray Mountain Shelter

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660606,"“Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.” -Vincent Van GoghLast night before bed, Andy & Melanie, The Maine Couple showed up before dark and joined us at the picnic table at the shelter. They started cooking their dinner and it was an impressive production. They boiled vegetable bullion cubes and added in instant grits. Then they added this to instant mashed potatoes and topped it off with chives they had picked earlier in the day and fresh ground black pepper. It looked much more satisfying than the lemon pepper tuna packets on flour tortillas that I had.
It was another early bedtime and around midnight we had a few light rain showers hitting the tent. By morning everything was pretty much dry and we had yet another beautiful fiery sunrise. The shelter area had probably 20 people and a dog staying there and we were near the last ones out, even though we left earlier than usual for us. After climbing the .3 miles uphill to get back to the trail, we had to cover the 3.6 miles to Dick’s Creek Gap by 10:00 in order to catch the shuttle into Hiawassee, Georgia where we are resupplying and staying until Saturday morning. There was a blue-blazed side trail to a “vista” along the way. We had told ourselves that unless the weather was such that there would be no views, we were going to walk the extra distance to take in the scenic views.  It was a beautiful morning and we were making good time on the trail, so we took the exit. It led to a great unobstructed view of about 6 rows of mountains surrounding a lake. Near the end of our hike, we met a nice local Trail Ambassador who visited with us and gave us information on the next couple of sections of our hike. With only a couple of moderate climbs on the day, we made it to the road with about 45 minutes to spare.  Today’s short miles moved the needle to 3%!
Yak was the only hiker at the shuttle stop when we arrived and just as we began to visit with him, the shuttle pulled up. While walking to the shuttle, we noticed Lily the Ridge Runner getting out of her car in the parking area. We went over and visited with her for a while as we waited for other hikers to arrive before our 10:00 departure. The shuttle dropped us off at a large Ingles grocery store. We fought the urge to go buy our resupply when hungry and walked over to the Holiday Inn Express instead. They stored our packs for us while we ran some other errands before checking in. While waiting, we rummaged through the hiker box in their lobby. Many places in trail towns have hiker boxes where people can take or leave items. For example if you needed 8 freezer bags to cook your meals in the next section, but they only sold them 50 at a time, you could put the extra in a hiker box so you wouldn’t have to carry the extra weight and another hiker wouldn’t have to buy 50 bags they didn’t need. Then it was off to a local outfitter to get a few items and sign their AT Class of 2023 wall sized poster. Next we went to Tilted Café at the outfitter’s suggestion. The hostess offered us outdoor seating but it wasn’t really an eat outside kind of day. It may have been because we didn’t exactly smell like day hikers. We eventually got a table inside with the clean folks and had giant double-meated cheeseburgers. I think we have a new appreciation for food, because they were incredibly delicious. After stopping by the post office, we walked back to Ingles to buy our food for the next 4 hiking days. Did I mention a new appreciation for food?When we got it back to the room and started sorting things by meals and by days, it looked like 3 unsupervised children had been turned loose in a grocery store with a credit card. I think most of it will fit in our bear bags, but it will be heavy the first couple of days.   The next “town chore” was probably the best, a nice long hot shower. Washing the salt away felt amazing. Then it was laundry time. Traditionally, hikers do laundry wearing their rain gear because they are washing EVERYTHING else.  I had not been hiking in my shorts, so I was able to change into them for the evening. 
While waiting for our clothes to dry, the local steakhouse that is within walking distance closed, so we called up Dominoes  and each ordered a pizza delivered to the hotel. I’m pretty sure I have consumed more than 3.6 miles worth of calories today, but I’ll need them soon. Saturday will be our last day of hiking in Georgia and we plan to start increasing our mileage a bit. With our town chores done today, we can relax tomorrow on our Zero day. And wherever we go, we will smell like day hikers.","Deep Gap Shelter

Well after a night in a real bed, we got up and hit the free breakfast at the hotel. Everything is up to date in Hiawassee!  They had a machine that you just push 1 button and it squeezes out pancake batter onto a pair of heated conveyor belts and spits out two golden brown pancakes that just drop onto your waiting plate. I mean, I would have expected such technology in a metropolis like Kansas City, but right here in Hiawassee?!?!
Next we double checked and re-packed our resupply of meals for the next 4 days. We’re not looking forward to hauling all of that food up and down the mountains, but we will be very glad to have it. 

Then it was a walk back to the outfitters where we ran into “The Honeymooners” Plunger and Avery and heard about their hostel experience. We should be on the same pace for this next section also and see them daily. Next we hit the post office and TheOkie and Jeff picked up some small items from the grocery store. We will be depositing a few items in the hiker box before we leave. We looked in the really nice looking hiker box outside of the outfitter earlier, but we decided it’s what’s on the inside that matters, and there wasn’t nearly as much in that one as there is in the plain one in the hotel.One more shower and a short walk to the steakhouse and our zero day town chores will be done. Luckily we read that the free shuttle we took into town only runs Monday to Friday. Felt kind of like the Hotel California. We could get into Hiawassee, but couldn’t get out. The outfitters gave us a list of local shuttle drivers and Jeff has us lined up to head back to the trail Saturday morning with Hitch-A-Hiker Shuttle. So tomorrow we will walk into North Carolina after taking the time to rest and refresh on our first Zero day.","Hiawassee

I had my best night of sleep since leaving home. When I got up this morning, we headed downstairs for breakfast and another round with the pancake machine. Then it was time to pack up and head downstairs to catch our shuttle. Our shuttle driver Grace, trail name RU, was a hoot. When asked if she preferred picking up clean hikers and returning them to trail, she said she was “noseblind”. But she later admitted that there are 1 window down hikers, 2 window down, 3 window down, 4 window down hikers, & get your rear in the bed of the pickup hikers!  She also said that by the North Carolina border, you can count on 30% of the people that started a thru hike attempt will already give up the dream.  She said that we older hikers are the cartilage club, where we have more money than cartilage. So her advice was to take it slow and easy and not try to keep up with the 20 year olds. We shared the shuttle with Impatient & Granny Gear. When Grace dropped us off at the Dick’s Creek Gap parking lot, there was a large group set up to provide trail magic. Having just eaten, we thanked them for the offer and started our hike. 
The hike started out with a climb and kept climbing. Georgia wanted to make our send-off memorable.  About 9 miles into our hike, we reached the Georgia-North Carolina border. Our first major milestone, 1 state down and 13 states to go. We stopped to take pictures to commemorate the occasion.  I have seen people’s pictures with this sign for 10 years, and today it was my turn.  You don’t just hop out and stroll over to this sign. It is hard to get there and you have to really want to be there. Just past the border there was a nice spring, so we stopped to refill our water bottles. Sitting at the spring having lunch were Atlas and his human Mark. We had a nice visit with them as we collected water and then hit the trail again.The North Carolina Chamber of Commerce must not have had any input into the trail route selection. It was brutal!  The climbs definitely made a first impression on us. Maybe the easy living of town life softened me up yesterday, but today seemed hard. In our 11.8 mile hike today, we climbed over 4,000 ft. and we felt it. We reached the Muskrat Creek Shelter at trail mile 81 and were the first ones there. We decided to stay in the shelter since there is a 90% chance of 1 to 2 inches of rain tonight. This way we won’t have to pack up wet tents in the morning. Once the rain quits tomorrow afternoon, we are supposed to have a streak of dry, but cold days.
After getting our sleeping pads and sleeping bags out, we threw on some additional warm layers and then grabbed our food bags for a well deserved lunch. As a special treat, Jeff hiked in a 1 lb summer sausage for us to share to celebrate crossing into a new state. 
So far, I have walked 232,318 steps in Georgia. They say that the average steps to complete a thru hike is 5 million!  I think that is just the steps of the actual trail miles, so my total steps should be higher. I am presently sitting in a sunny spot on a ridge above the shelter where I can get cell signal to post a journal. A nice young hiker named Connor came up here and is setting up his tent and visiting with me about today’s hike and hikers we both know. Soon it will be time to head back down where TheOkie, Jeff, Impatient, Granny Gear, Just Try, Danny Boy, and Good are. We will have an early dinner, hang our bear bags, then retire to our warm, dry sleeping bags for the evening. We will have another hard day tomorrow, but that’s what makes it great.","Dick’s Creek Gap

We have been blessed by a lot of good decisions so far on this hike. The decision to hunker down in the shelter last night was certainly one of them. It POURED all night long!  We were cozy, warm, and dry in our bags. As the sun came up and people started dragging their soaking wet belongings to the shelter, we realized that not everyone fared so well. As it was still pouring, there was a lot of conversation by people planning to just stay at the shelter all day to avoid the rain. We decided that wasn’t for us and that we would stick to our plan to hike 12.5 miles to Carter Gap Shelter. 
So we all three put on our rain pants and rain jackets over our hiking clothes. We had to unzip and re-zip throughout the day to regulate our temperature even though the air temperature ranged from about 36° to 39°. We would get hot and start sweating as we climbed hills and get chilled when we would turn onto the windy side of the mountains. There was a pretty steady light rain all day, but nothing like the floods of last night. We had to be extra careful walking over all of the wet, slick roots snd rocks.  
We really had a good day of hiking as Jeff led us today. We climbed Standing Indian Mountain, which at 5,478 feet is our tallest mountain so far. Even though it is taller than the mountains we climbed yesterday, the grade to the top was much gentler and made for a lot more fun climb. I have no doubt that the views from the mountains were spectacular.  But since we were hiking in a fog filled rain cloud all day, we weren’t able to catch any of them. 
When we got to the Carter Gap Shelter at mile 93.5, the shelter was full. There were people that had hammock camped through last night’s rain that were just trying to dry out their totally soaked sleep systems. We quickly set up our tents in the light rain, went and got water that we will need for tonight and tomorrow morning, ate lunch/supper, and put our warm dry clothes on. Now I am in my warm sleeping bag writing today’s journal. 
Since returning to the trail yesterday, we have hiked over 24 miles with over 6,500 feet of ascents and over 4,700 feet of descents. We have now pushed the needle past the 4% mark. Even with the cold rain, we kept a smile on our faces through today’s adventure.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

It was 35° in the tent this morning with a good breeze causing it to flutter. I was wondering why the breeze hadn’t caused all of the raindrops to roll off of it until I reached up and flicked one and it popped off as a solid piece of ice. TheOkie’s thermometer was outside and it registered 28°. That doesn’t get you too excited about leaving the comfort of your sleeping bag. Luckily I had slept with my water filter, phone, and battery bank in the bag with me so they wouldn’t freeze. The cold puts a drain on the batteries, which isn’t terrible, but allowing your water filter to freeze can ruin it and you won’t know until you get a very unpleasant symptom from the filter not doing its job. I also sleep with my hiking clothes that will be next to my skin, inside the bag to “pre-heat” them which makes it slightly easier to get out of my “keep-dry-at-all-costs” sleeping clothes. This morning’s low of 28° is the warmest of the next few days as it should get down to  20° before this weather system moves on. 
After a mile on the trail, we hit a patch of sunlight and stopped to shed some clothing. We took in a beautiful view at a short side-trail and did a lot of our early walking among an amazing amount of blow-downs. We noticed the same thing in yesterday’s hike. Our guess is hurricane damage or possibly a tornado, but something left large sections looking like a war zone. 
A big milestone was waiting for us in the middle of our day. On top of Albert Mountain, at 5,213 feet, is a fire tower that is the symbolic 100 mile mark. It was no easy task to reach it. It was some of the most steep steps and rock slabs that we’ve had to climb so far, to get up to it. Some rocks were climbed using hands and feet and in one place they had installed a makeshift ladder. Not exactly your typical hiking terrain. Once we arrived at the tower, Impatient and Granny Gear helped us take pictures to commemorate the first 100 miles of our journey. Then we climbed the stairs to the top and were rewarded with a spectacular 360° view of the surrounding mountains. The beautiful weather gave us incredible views that would not have been possible just 1 day before. We have been blessed by many things on our trip and this was just another one to be thankful for.  It was certainly difficult to get there, but it was certainly great. 
We decided that instead of hiking a short day and going into Franklin to resupply, that we would go in after hiking today, then come back out and hike a full day tomorrow. We arranged for rooms and a shuttle from a hilltop about a mile and a half before the end of our hike because you never know where you will have cell service. Sherpa Al, a very nice shuttle driver texted back almost immediately and said that he was actually at the road crossing where our hike would end and that he would take us in to Franklin. That last mile and a half was an easy grade of switchbacks down the mountain and we  flew down in about 30 minutes. On the drive into town, Sherpa Al said he would deliver us back to the same spot in the morning when we were ready. He also mentioned there was one last extraction point at Wayah Gap 9.5 miles down trail if we would like to stay in Franklin again Tuesday night and avoid another of the  20° nights. Why yes, I believe we would like that. We have been very blessed on the trip so far and we feel that we have made a lot of good decisions. We think this is also a good decision. 
So tonight we walked down the road to the KFC and feasted on chicken then back to the room to shower, do a little “sink laundry”, and air out and dry out a few things. Tomorrow we will get picked up at 10:00 when the windchill will be UP to 29° and knock out 9.5 more miles of the trail.","Carter Gap Shelter

This morning we went downstairs in the Hampton Inn of Franklin, North Carolina to have breakfast. There we saw Freeze finishing his breakfast and heading back to the trail. He said that he had had lots of problems stemming from starting out with too many miles. It had forced him to regroup and adjust some things, but he was still on trail. After my breakfast of blueberry waffles, an English muffin and a banana, I went back to the room to pack up the items I had been drying out, like my tent and food bag since they had been packed up after a night of rain. Then Sherpa Al, The Hiker’s Pal showed up to take us back to Rock Gap where we had left off yesterday. We made arrangements for him to again retrieve us at Wayah Gap for one last stay in Franklin. At about 10:30, our 28° morning started out with a steep uphill climb. In under a mile, we were stopping to remove our outmost layers. Throughout the day we would zip up, unzip, add clothing, take off clothing, making frequent adjustments depending on the sun, the wind, and the steepness of the hike. We hit a high of 34° briefly, but fell back to 27° in the icy breeze before our hike ended around 3:00.There were 2 unique items of note on today’s 9.5 mile hike. First, we saw clumps of needle ice everywhere today. These fragile ribbonlike columns of ice grow up from the ground under very specific moisture and temperature conditions and today on the AT must have been the sweet spot. Some were a few inches tall and all of them were fascinating.The second unique item today was climbing our first bald, Siler Bald. This high open knob gave us the most spectacular views of the trip so far. It was a .2 mile side hike off of the actual AT. It was very steep going up to the false summit and then the actual summit. When we arrived at the turnoff, Spark, formerly OH and her sister IO, were sitting there in a sunny spot having lunch. I don’t think we had seen them since Woody Gap on the very stormy day over a week ago and it was nice to visit with them. We climbed up and up into the cold winds and stayed on top long enough to take in the views of mountains after mountains after mountains. We took a few pictures and then swiftly headed down with freezing fingers and cold faces. At the bottom, we saw a couple of thru hikers walk by and we told them that the views were really worth the effort of climbing the bald. They decided to hike on by, missing that opportunity because of the amount of effort it would take. I’m glad that so far, when the weather is cooperating, we are making the extra efforts to see the spectacular views that we will most likely never see again.
After descending down the mountain to Wayah Gap very quickly, we were picked up by the waiting Sherpa Al. We were glad to be in the warm car as he drove us back into Franklin and to the Sapphire motel. The Sapphire isn’t going to be confused with the Hampton, but it is close to downtown and allowed us to walk to some places we wanted to visit. 
We walked uphill to the outfitter, Outdoor 76. I have read about them in Trailjournals for years. They have the foremost shoe and footcare experts along the trail. I have read story after story of them saving people’s hikes by getting them into an appropriate shoe and getting rid of their foot pain. The 3 of us are all very pleased with our shoes, but I was curious what they would recommend for me in case I needed to switch out at some point. The gentleman said he saw I was wearing Brooks Cascadias and couldn’t understand why I would be having a problem because that is exactly what he would have recommended. In fact he said all 3 of our shoes were his top recommendations for shoes least likely to do damage on a thru hike. The nice employees there also recommended a nearby Mexican restaurant where we went and had a great dinner before walking the 3/4 of a mile back downhill to the Sapphire. 
Today we ended up at mile 115.3 which firmly moves the needle to 5%. We’re getting there!","Rock Gap

The time will pass anyway.” -Earl Nightingale It was an early wake-up with anticipation of a free all-you-can-eat hiker pancake breakfast, but plans kind of fell through so we walked over to the local McDonalds. Incidentally, their lobby opens at 8, so we were able to stand outside visiting a few minutes on the gorgeous frosty morning. After breakfast it was a walk back to the sapphire to pack up and wait for Sherpa Al to deliver us to the woods one last time.
Sherpa Al showed up right on time. He has been a big help to us and is very knowledgeable about this area of the AT. We have enjoyed him and not just because we now associate him with a warm place to stay. Al delivered us to Wayah Gap and Jeff led us right up a climb. Soon we were stopping to shed layers on the cool morning. 
4.2 miles into our hike we reached the top of Wayah Bald. There is a stone fire tower on top of the bald that has official white blazes painted on the side indicating that the trail goes right to it.  The views from the top on this crystal clear day were magnificent. Not long after we arrived some other people had arrived by car via the winding road that the trail had crossed a few times. Seeing our loaded backpacks, they asked several questions about our hike. They were very friendly folks, some from Florida, and they were curious about our hike. We love sharing our trail experiences with others, so we had a fun question and answer session on top of the mountain. After a snack and a bit of water, Jeff led us down from the top of the bald and up and down and up and down, as the AT does. A little after 3:00 we reached the Cold Spring Shelter. If you watch the video at the end, you will see that it is appropriately named. We continued on .1 mile to tent sites that have an incredible view off the side of the mountain. 
When we walked back down to the spring located at the shelter, we met Scotty. He got his trail name because he is from Scotland. He has been covering big miles so we will probably only see him tomorrow when we both stop at the same place, but he plans to finish the trail by July, so he will be flying up the trail. Coming back to our tent area, we walked over to the miniature picnic table where we had a late lunch with Superior, a new hiker we just met at camp. 
A few other notes from today’s hike, first, the ice needles that were in shady areas continued to grow since yesterday with some of them getting to be 5 or 6 inches. Secondly, frozen mud is a great walking surface, but once the top layer of it melts, hold on!  The thin melted layer promotes your foot sliding on the bottom frozen layer and we all had some doozies today. I think Jeff had the day’s record of sliding over 3 feet on 1 foot with a half pirouette. It was a thing of beauty and knock on wood, none of us fell to the ground thanks in a large part to our trekking poles.","Wayah Gap

Last night after posting, I fired up the Jetboil and made a tasty dinner of Ramen noodles with a packet of chicken added for extra protein and flavor. Then we had a special treat. Last week, Smokey Bear a trail angel / shuttle driver had given the Maine couple Andy and Melanie an apple cinnamon muffin mix and said that if you add hot water, it is kind of like pudding. Well who could resist that, right?  So when we were in Hiawassee resupplying I got us a blueberry muffin mix to celebrate when we crossed the border into North Carolina. Well due to eating in town and other circumstances, I have been carrying that half pound of muffin mix several days longer than I planned to. So last night, the conditions were right and we gathered around to belatedly celebrate entering North Carolina with blueberry muffin-pudding prepared in a ziplock bag. The reviews were mixed. I like cookie dough better than cookies, so I enjoyed it. (Not enough to carry an extra half pound on my back for a week.) Jeff seemed a little put off by the fact that the imitation blueberry nuggets never really softened up and there may have been some other issues that left him kind of luke warm on muffin-pudding. TheOkie is a cold soaker, meaning he did not bring a stove to prepare any hot meals, just cold ramen and cold oatmeal, so we already knew he would eat anything. He seemed to enjoy it about as much as I did, but probably not enough that we will try it again. 
Our tent location provided another vivid orange sunrise after a good night’s sleep. It was still cold, so after retrieving our bear bags full of food, we packed up quickly and got an early start. The Cold Spring Shelter privy had a unique feature, or lacked a feature.  There was no door AND the privy faced the trail, I guess so you could fully greet any approaching hikers. 
We passed by Connor and Superior before reaching the hiking highlight of the day, the fire tower on Wesser Bald. At 4,618 feet, the observation deck on the tower provided amazing views once again on this crystal clear day. We had a snack there and visited with a couple from Chattanooga that were curious about our thru hike. After that most of the day was down, down, down to the Nantahala Outdoor Center, or the NOC at 1,727 feet. I won’t complain about going down for 11.5 miles because going up is so hard on the legs and the lungs, but my knees would love to see a bit of level ground. (Spoiler alert, we won’t get that level ground tomorrow either as we plan to walk 13.9 miles and will have over 4,700 feet of climbing.). On the way down we went through the most harrowing section of the trail so far, walking down makeshift rock steps down the side of a cliff. Also today the trail was littered with blowdowns. I’m not sure what hit the area, but we climbed over, under, and around dozens of trees across the trail today. The trail maintainers will have their work cut out for them when they tackle this section. Before hitting the NOC, May the dog and her human came hiking by. I consider our hiking speed above average, but they disappeared in no time.  On today’s hike we passed the 6% mark on the trail.  Clicking those miles off.
Once at the NOC, we arranged for a room for the night. It is indoors, has electricity, heat and air, and 4 bunks. There is a bathroom, showers, and kitchen in a building just a few feet away. After unloading our packs, we went back down the hill to a restaurant that overlooks the river. We had a nice meal of “town food” while watching kayakers take on the rapids just outside the window. 
Finally we came back up the hill to our “cabin” then went and showered, brushed our teeth, and did a little sink laundry. It’s been another great but hard day on the trail. Tomorrow will most likely be farther, harder, and wetter, but should be another great day as we continue our adventure.","Cold Spring Shelter

It was our longest mileage day, it was our most climbing day, and it rained ALL DAY. But you know what?  We all made it and are ready to go for tomorrow. The NOC is located on a world class kayaking river which means when you leave, you climb from river level to mountain top level. There seem to be 2 ways to get to the top of a mountain, walking uphill or climbing. I greatly prefer the gradual grade that allows you to walk uphill. Today we had lots of climbs, which led to a lot of huffing, puffing, and burning legs. At least on a cold, rainy day like this the climbing would keep you warmer. On the ridge lines and mountain tops today, we were being pelted with gusty waves of cold rain. Once down below a bit, it was much more hospitable. I started the morning with my umbrella, but the trail was pretty narrow and tree lined which added to the difficulty of the day. If I were starting the day over, I would have worn my rain pants. I thought today would be warmer and with all of the climbing they would be too hot. As it turned out, I would have been glad to have been hotter, rather than as wet and cold as  I was. 
Our streak of none of us falling also came to an end today as we had someone fall twice in rapid succession. No injuries, but we were all on high alert as we slipped in the mud.
About a mile from the end, we stopped just below a peak where we had cell signal and searched for a shuttle. Amy from Wing & Hoof mountain escapes came and picked us up.  Sherpa Al had recommended her and she lived up to his kind words. We had talked about going to the Fontana Lodge for the evening to dry out, but after visiting with her, we were convinced that we just needed to go to her hostel. The 3 of us have a private room with 3 beds and a bathroom at the end of our hall. We quickly took turns getting out of our soaking clothes and taking hot showers. That felt divine. Then she took all of our wet, dirty, smelly hiker clothes and will return them to us dry and day-hiker fresh. We have fresh baked cookies, drinks, and a huge breakfast in the morning. After breakfast, she will shuttle us back to Stecoah Gap to resume our hike in much better weather than today. She also drove us to town where we went to an outstanding Italian restaurant and ate our fill of great food and breadsticks.

Well this morning started off with a GREAT, HUGE breakfast prepared by Amy at Wing and Hoof. She must work around the clock to do all that she does. For breakfast, I had Mexican quiche, smoked gouda grits, bacon, French toast, orange juice, and a blueberry muffin that was even better than muffin-pudding!  There were many other items, but that is all that I had. Beans, a very good natured vegan couldn’t eat the things I did, but was very happy with his fruit, oatmeal, and peanut butter filled pretzels nuggets. I mention this because as he was eating a plate full of pretzel nuggets with a fork, the conversation turned to what utensil would be best suited for the task. Someone suggested chopsticks and as if by magic, he produced the pair of chopsticks he hikes with and finished them off with chopsticks in very impressive fashion. You never know what you’ll see on the AT.
After breakfast we were dropped back off at Stecoah Gap. It was a beautiful crisp morning and the hike started off with a huge climb right from the start. We climbed almost 1,000 feet in the first 2 miles. We had been warned about this “Jacob’s Ladder” section and it lived up to the warning. Through the middle of the hike, there were actually sections that went up and down at a gradual slope. That was very appreciated by our tired lungs and knees. Then it was up, up, up again. No one had warned us that Esau had a ladder as well. There were also several “rock jumbles” that we had to navigate. While these are kind of fun, they put a serious hurt on your feet and can be quite slippery with an increased chance of a trip-ending fall. Luckily no falls today were trip-ending. Speaking of Falls, Jeff managed to keep from falling after catching his big toe on a hidden root, but it took him 15 feet of pole flailing to ride it out and defeat the powers of gravity. It was truly an inspiring save.
About 5 miles from the end of the hike, we caught our first glimpses of Fontana Lake and the Fontana Dam. We kept walking and walking and although we could see the lake, it didn’t seem like we were ever getting any closer to it. It was literally a couple of hours of walking up and down, over peaks, around switchbacks, and through even more “rock jumbles” and the lake kept eluding us. Finally we made it down to lake level and walked down to the Fontana Marina where we resupplied food for our first 3 days of the Smokies and printed off our Smoky Mountain National Park permits. This section is one of the few on the AT that you actually have to buy a permit for.
Next we caught a shuttle up to the lodge and checked in for 1 night before we hit the Smokies. We saw Sparks in the lobby while checking in. She and her sister IO are also staying here.
After unloading our packs in the room, we headed down the path to the restaurant. We were joined by Scotty for dinner and had a great conversation about his former career as a firefighter, his hobbies, family, and Scotland. We all ate a lot since breakfast tomorrow will be our last town food until Tuesday night.  I’m also not sure how much cell coverage we will have in the Smokies, so I’ll post updates as soon as I can.
It is amazing the difference a day can make, weather wise. Today was beautiful and a great day for hiking, even if it was a long, hard day. We moved the needle up to 7% today. As we came down the mountain, we saw thousands of trillium coming out and some starting to bloom. That gave us something to look at as we chased that elusive lake.","Stecoah Gap

This morning we woke up in the Fontana Lodge in a nice warm room. We walked down the hill and I had a big country breakfast of bacon, eggs, and grits. Then we caught the shuttle back to the Fontana marina where we had left off our hike yesterday. We hiked up past the “Fontana Hilton” which is supposed to be the nicest shelter on the AT. It is a double decker shelter with a charging station and showers. Then we hiked across the actual Fontana dam, a 480 foot tall hydroelectric dam. On the far side of the dam, we entered the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. After a short road walk into the park, the trail headed into the woods. We stopped and deposited our thru hiker permits in the designated box and then as all days seem to start, we went up and up. After 6 1/2 miles, we hit the top of Shuckstack mountain and took the short side trail to the fire tower. Now the tower may no longer be quite up to code, but it provided some outstanding views. We made it up and down safely then continued on our way. At the end of our 16.3 mile day, we came to the Russell Field shelter. The double decker shelter with a fireplace holds 14 hikers, but was already full, so we are tenting near the shelter as is required in the Smokies. I cooked ramen with chicken so I would have something warm to eat and have now hung my bear bag from the cables provided. It is currently 18° in my tent and the sun hasn’t set yet. Today’s mileage was difficult, and tonight’s weather will be cold, but that’s part of what it takes to complete this journey.  We have now passed the 8% mark on the trail.","Fontana Marina

He hurls down his crystals of ice like crumbs; who can stand before his cold?” -Psalm‬ ‭147:16-17‬ ‭ESV The temperature continued to drop last night making it difficult to keep all of me warm. My head and core were fine, but my feet were a bit cool even with my sleep socks on. About midnight I woke with the urge to go to the bathroom, or the woods as it were.  I knew it was inevitable that I couldn’t lie there for  7 more hours, but I sure didn’t want to give up the warmth in my sleeping bag and step out into the icy gusting winds. I eventually gave in and QUICKLY stepped out of the tent and rushed back in. That made sleeping better, but I still dreaded packing up my tent & all in about 15° weather. We rushed through that chore while we could still move our fingers and hurried on to the trail to get moving and warm up. There was not much of a breakfast even by our standards as TheOkie in his wisdom was the only one that slept with his water bottle and didn’t just have a block of ice. As usual, we had lots of uphill climbs to warm us up and were soon stripping off layers. Eventually enough of the ice in the water bottles melted that we could at least wet our mouths. In the distance we could see what looked like crystal forests where large accumulations of ice had coated the trees. After traveling through clear trail surrounded by the ground covered in snow, we arrived in the ice covered trees. As the temperatures rose, they began shedding the ice and you could see it hitting the ground around you. A few times today, the trail resembled climbing up frozen waterfalls of both solid ice and ice covered rock jumbles. It was definitely a day to be careful and thankfully none of our falls had any serious consequences. Midway through the day, we stopped at a shelter to get water from it’s piped spring. It was nice to be able to drink all I wanted and after refilling the bottle, the ice eventually melted. I plan to join TheOkie and sleep with my water bottle in the bag tonight so I will have water to drink when we start hiking tomorrow. Today was another long, hard day of hiking, but it turned out absolutely beautiful and after the temperatures hit above freezing, it was very nice for hiking. I have noticed that my feet continually take a beating from the rocks on the trail, my knees take a beating on the steep downhills, and my quads and lungs take a beating in the frequent steep uphills. But God is good and each night, no matter how cold or poor the sleep has been, my body has been recovering and is ready to face the next day.","Russell Field Shelter

Twice. But I did rise up each time, even though the first fall will leave a mark, so I think Mr. Emerson would be proud. But more about that later. This morning we woke up to much more comfortable temperatures, in the 20’s, where we slept on the top deck of the double decker Siler’s Bald shelter. I had followed TheOkie’s lead of sleeping with my water bottle in my sleeping bag and had water to drink with breakfast and through the first part of today’s hike. We quickly started hiking to warm up and just a couple of miles in, we entered the most beautiful section of trail we have seen. It looked like an enchanted forest with everything carpeted in a dense green moss. There were giant old trees resting on the forest floor covered in green and there were boulders beside them covered in green. The treadway was wide and smooth, covered in spruce needles, and for the most part a gradual grade. For really the first time, I thought that this might actually be a place a non-thru hiker would enjoy walking with us. This led us up to Clingman’s Dome, a place notable for being the highest point on the entire Appalachian Trail at 6,644 feet, as well as the 200 mile mark for northbound hikers. We climbed the long winding ramp up the structure to the 360° observation deck. The views were incredible in all directions. Thru hikers had the place to ourselves since access roads to the landmark don’t open until April. We took some photos and made some calls to family, but didn’t linger too long up there due to the exposure to the cold winds. Once back down to the base, we ate some snacks and took more photos to commemorate having walked 200 miles. Then the trail tried to kill us. Heading down from Clingman’s Dome going north, the trail resembled walking down a frozen waterfall. We were being cautious and trying to only step on dry rocks on the side, but at one point I took a step and in the blink of an eye I was landing awkwardly on my left shin and right forearm. It was a move that would have undoubtedly won any Twister game. I got up hoping I was all in one piece and quickly got moving back down the frozen waterfall knowing that I needed to be extra cautious. A while later, I don’t exactly know what happened but in a flash, I was laying on my backpack. I’m happy to report that this time, I don’t think any of me made initial contact with the ice. At this point, the rest of the hike basically became a variant of “the floor is lava” except it was “the ice is lava”. I did not fall victim to the ice again. At the end of our “short” 12 mile day, we reached Newfound Gap and TheOkie’s wife, mother, and father. As we were walking to their car, we were met with trail magic from a family on vacation. We noticed Omaha and other hikers that we had been leapfrogging with through the day being offered all kinds of goodies and so we walked over. I had 2 packages of goldfish crackers and they really hit the spot after about 7 hours of hard hiking on a couple of Cliff bars, some peanut butter crackers, and some honey stinger chews. TheOkie’s family loaded us up and headed for Pigeon Forge where we will spend a double zero, or 2 non-hiking days. The traffic was crazy. My guess is that it was partly spring breakers and part due to road construction. We made it to the hotel, checked in and dropped our backpacks in the room and then headed out in search of town food. Jeff From Kansas pulled out his phone and found a place nearby that had good reviews, so we ended up at the Old Mill restaurant. It was really great and had large portions. I made a happy plate of my chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes and gravy, green beans,salad, soup, dessert. Then it was back to the hotel to shower. A few other things of note. The needle has now jumped up to the 9% completed mark. We have walked over 200 miles, which is basically the rounding error, and finally have less than 2,000 miles to go. The trail runs the border of North Carolina and Tennessee. So while we are not through with North Carolina, we have been hiking in and out of Tennessee these last 2 days. Also, when I went to reset my thermometer high and low, I checked the actual low temperature night before last in my tent and it was 13°.  With Spring starting today, here’s hoping to have no more 13° nights on the trail.","Siler’s Bald Shelter

Today is a Zero day in Pigeon Forge, the first of a Double Zero while we rest up and enjoy the company of TheOkie’s family. After a good night’s sleep in a comfortable bed in a climate controlled room it was time for town chores. I went downstairs to enjoy the hotel breakfast. Then it was time to do laundry. Next I had a 2 hour Zoom meeting wearing my most presentable clothing that wasn’t in the wash. Following that it was time for more of my favorite town chore: Eat Town Food. 
We went to a diner where I had a grilled onion burger and fries followed by a large hot fudge sundae. I only ate the hot fudge sundae for training purposes so I’ll be ready to take on the challenge when I hit Pine Grove Furnace State Park. Early indications would suggest it will take more than 1 Lactase tablet when the day comes. 
A few more thoughts and facts on the journey so far:  Since starting in Georgia until reaching Newfound Gap, I have taken 570,238 steps. Because the trail zigs and zags between North Carolina and Tennessee, I won’t know the actual steps for each state individually. We are at trail mile 207.7 and finally have LESS than 2,000 miles to go. We have hiked in 3 states and ONLY have 11 more states to hike in. We have climbed a cumulative 52,756 feet (think climbing a 10 mile staircase) and ONLY have 411,708 more feet of climbing. For comparison, Mt. Everest is 29,029 feet tall. Let’s hear it for the lungs and quads. We have had 50,366 feet of descent. Let’s hear it for the knees. We have walked over a bazillion rocks and roots. Say a prayer for our feet. 
We have seen countless spectacular views, crossed paths with many great hikers and trail angels, and felt enormous gratitude that our bodies have been able to answer every challenge so far.","Pigeon Forge

Use both and overlook neither.” -Alan Cohen Well today is the final day of rest on this double zero in Pigeon Forge. We will use it to plan out our next section, resupply our food, eat town food, and rest up so we will be ready to work hard when TheOkie’s family drops us back off at Newfound Gap tomorrow morning. We have a few milestones coming up in the next 3 days. We will exit the Great Smoky Mountain National Park which contains 71 miles of the Appalachian Trail. We will come to the end of the first map segment in the FarOut app that we use for navigation. This app lists every tentsite, shelter, water source, and point of interest on the trail. We use it throughout the day to see where we are by gps, where we will need to refill our water, how much more climbing we have to look forward to, and lots of other information. We also use FarOut in planning out our resupply options so we know how many days worth of food we need to carry. Although I don’t think any of us have that very dialed in. We have been carrying too much food between resupplies, which just means carrying extra weight. Part of that is due to the quantities that some items come in and part is due to being hungry when we are buying food and a fear of being hungry on the trail. Today I won’t fear being hungry. Last night I had steak, baked potato, and salad for supper. I had breakfast at the hotel, sushi & gyozas for lunch, and another steak, sweet potato, salad, and 7 rolls for dinner tonight. I’m doing a good job of replacing those important calories and protein while in town.  I calculated a days worth of food I’ll be carrying on the trail for this next section and it is about 1,800 calories and 72 grams of protein per day. I will definitely burn more than that, so it is important to make up what I can in town. I also stopped by the local REI today and replaced my fuel canister, got some more honey stingers, and got an additional battery bank to keep everything charged up on longer stretches. The staff there were super friendly and helpful.  It has been a good, productive double zero.","Pigeon Forge

After a great 2 days of rest and town food, TheOkie’s family delivered us back to Newfound Gap high up in the Smokies. After a few pictures and thanking them for their hospitality, we were back on the trail. There is a lot of tourist traffic on the first section of the trail, so the paths were nice and wide. Due to the melting ice and rains the last couple of days, parts of the trail were a muddy mess. Before long, the trail was back to its narrow rocky self. At one point, we heard the distinct tinkling of a bell and soon we came up on a day hiker with a “bear bell” hanging from his day pack. That is the first one of those I’ve seen. It was quite a while before there was a place to pass, so it felt like we were following Father Christmas up the mountain forever. Once past him, we met a few groups of day hikers and families out for a morning walk. We met one group of college kids right in a section that was sloppy, shoe-deep mud. They didn’t seem too excited about that. At a couple of points the trail followed a ridge that was no wider than my trekking pole with fairly steep drop offs on both sides. We felt like we were hiking a repetitive loop of a rocky uphill section, a moss covered wonderland section, a nice section next to a dripping rock wall, a narrow ridge section, and then a section opened up for spectacular views of row after row of mountain ranges. It was all beautiful hiking and not a terrible grade on the climbs today.  Four miles into the day, we took the side trail to Charlie’s Bunion.  It is a rock outcropping that juts out from the mountain and you can climb out on it. It has great views, and is a pretty epic photo spot when you are standing on it. Jeff agreed to stay back on the solid mountain and be the official photographer.   It was a good first day back on the trail. We plan to finish up the Smokies this weekend, so all we have to do is hike 3 relatively short days.  Today we were turning off for the .4 mile side trail to the shelter at about 2:30 today. We stopped to fill up our water bottles from a tiny trickle of water. When we got got he shelter,we put out our sleeping pads to claim our spots for the night. It is expected to be rainy and extremely windy tonight, so we decided to stay in the shelter and not have to pack up wet tents in the morning. Then it was time to eat and soon it will be time to hit the sleeping bags. There are a few other people at the shelter tonight. Two people Wildflower  and Soft Pedal section hiked the AT, completing it over the span of multiple years. They are now completing all of the other 900 miles of hiking trails through the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Fitzy is just starting to section hike the trail.

The predicted storm materialized about 4 am and hit with a fury. High winds and pounding rains were stopped by the roof of the shelter just inches above my head as I was sleeping on the upper deck of the double-decker shelter. It was crazy loud, and I was very appreciative to be warm and dry in my sleeping bag. Actually a little too warm. I wound up having to strip off my sleeping socks and bottom base layer because I was sweating.  This procedure is difficult in a zipped up mummy bag while trying not to disturb your shelter mates. This morning we headed out after eating breakfast in the shelter. The first .4 miles to the trail were uphill and don’t count in our actual AT miles. The trail today was very wet, actually a river in many places, especially early in the day. But for the most part, today’s hike was absolutely beautiful. We spent a lot of the day above 6,000 ft and were again in the magical looking zone where everything was carpeted in a thick green moss where sunlight has trouble reaching. A lot of the trail in this area was covered in spruce needles.  Hiking on this soft, flat surface feels so good on the feet. The skies were blue and the winds mostly died down when we were in the forests. There were a few narrow ridge walks today, but not as narrow as the “land bridges” as TheOkie called them yesterday.  A few times while crossing these, we had to hold on to our hats to keep them from blowing off of our heads and into the steep drop offs. We crossed a spot marked on the map as a helipad. There aren’t very many flat openings of any size in the Smokies, so this was rare. We also saw a piece of debris from a plane crash site that was noted on the map. The last 2 miles the trail had had enough of being nice. It finished out our day with a long uphill and a trail littered with rocks. When we arrived at the shelter, there were 5 weekend hikers from Mobile that were set up in it. About an hour later, they took a vote and decided to head back to civilization for the evening. So the 3 of us plus Waldo and Bambi now have the double decker shelter to ourselves until other thru hikers roll in.

 This morning the 4 of us in the shelter woke up to see the bright orange of a sunrise through the shelter opening. Before we had gotten dressed and packed up our things, that sunshine was replaced by a sudden downpour of rain. Eventually we went out into the rain cooled morning air to retrieve our bear bags so we could have breakfast. By the time we finished our small breakfast, the rain was gone, not to return again for the day. 
The hike today was pretty easy by recent standards. There was a long uphill, but it was a pretty favorable grade. There were stretches of rocky trail, but that was probably the minority for a change. The temperature was great and it was a clear sunny day. Most of today was hiking downhill as we left the Smokies. Luckily it was not the steep downhills that are so hard on the knees. 
About a mile before we exited the Smokies, a southbound hiker asked if we were thru hikers. After answering yes, Good News stopped and said that she and Blossom, Newfound, and Unfiltered were all Class of 2022 thru hikers out for a hike and doing trail magic. It was our lucky day and we were very appreciative! While eating my cupcake, chips, and having my capri sun drink, I visited with Newfound. She is also from the flatlands in Louisiana, but had gone to Eagle Rock Loop in Arkansas to train for her thru hike. If you recall, that is where TheOkie & I went for our training hike, although we got a bit flooded out on ours. As they hiked on, we headed down trail, our spirits fueled by their kindness. 
We stopped at the permit box in Davenport Gap for a picture commemorating our completion of the Smokies. A few yards further down was a road crossing where 2 people were set up with tables, chairs, a grill and a cooler.  Monarch, Stan The Man, and Zoby the dog ALL thru hiked in 2022 as well and were out to do trail magic to give back for all the kindness that was shown to them on their hike. They waived us over and Bambi was already there finishing up this extraordinary trail magic. I started off with a delicious fresh grilled hotdog while Stan The Man finished grilling a few more burgers. Then it was time for a great burger, chips, Coke, and some grapes all while sitting in a proper chair. We shared stories with them for about an hour while we sat, relaxed, and ate. They offered lots of great advice about the hike ahead and were such a blessing to us today. Again, we were so grateful for their acts of kindness to total strangers.  Jeff From Kansas was today’s leader and finally got up signaling that it was time to keep hiking before we fell into a food induced coma. So far, Jeff and TheOkie both have exhibited the willpower needed to drag us away from the siren song of fresh grilled trail magic. Luckily I have not been tested in this manner so far, I fear that I will be found lacking. 
TheOkie told me that after spending 2 days with me, his dad asked if I always eat that much. That may be my proudest moment on the trail so far, especially coming from a relative of TheOkie, who I consider to be a world class eater. It is true, I have been eating town food like it is my job. I still expect to lose 20 or more pounds on the hike, but probably not in the south. 
After our trail magic, we hiked to the I-40 underpass. It was interesting knowing that if I just walked about 900 miles down that 1 road, I would wind up just a few miles from my daughter’s house. 
As we climbed the hills leading away from I-40, we came to the Standing Bear Farm Hostel. When we arrived, we were fortunate enough to acquire the private cabin for the evening. This rustic cabin has 4 beds including the loft and promises to be the quieter option compared to the bunkhouse. We are steps away from the showers, the potties, the resupply storeroom, the kitchen, the fire pit, and the laundry. The laundry has a rub board to wash your clothes, but does have an actual electric dryer and loaner clothes. There are also towels you can use for showering. The place is very unique with lots of decorative paintings and mosaics in the rock and tile work on the grounds.  I’m not sure how many hikers are staying here, but I’m pretty sure there are more dogs on the property than people. While eating dinner sitting around the campfire I had 6 sad eyes staring me down. I would have gladly shared, but the owners asked us not to feed them. From their large, round size I am guessing not everyone honors the request. As we were in the resupply storeroom at the hostel, guess who should walk in but Pink Draggin’. It seems that he and Beans are here as well. Small world.  It seems that the universe is intent on crossing our paths.","Cosby Knob Shelter

We were told early on that the first 6 weeks on the trail are boot camp. Just put in your miles and climb your mountains and at some point you’ll get your “trail legs”. Well we are 4 weeks in and have definitely been putting in the work. We’ve moved the needle to 11%!  Today’s 15.5 mile hike had right at 1 mile of climbing. While our climbing has definitely improved, doing it all day long still wears you down. 
The day began  right out of the gate with a big climb. Before long the sky darkened and it looked like we might get rain, but it held off all day. At one point we were all getting phone calls and messages from the hostel owner who mistakenly thought one of us had left without paying our tab. After Jeff visited with them and jogged their memory, they realized that the error was on their part. The 3 of us may look sketchy, but we are an honorable lot. 
When we reached the summit of Snowbird Mountain we saw the large FAA VOR beacon that looks like it could find extraterrestrial life in its spare time. The extremely large white disk really stands out in the wilderness. 
Coming down from there we stopped at a water source, drank our fill and filled up our bottles. It was a good thing because it was another 6 miles before there was another source and when the sun was out on the climbs, we were thirsty. 
The highlight of the day was climbing the famous bald known as Max Patch. It offers unobstructed 360° views of the surrounding mountains and is very picturesque. It is also VERY windy up there!  We followed the trail around the bald only stopping briefly to put on jackets and take a few pictures. 
The treadway itself was pretty nice for the most part today with fewer rocks and roots than we have been seeing. When we reached the shelter, Bambi and Karaoke were there discussing trail magic that Bambi had received just before Max Patch. We asked if it was from a red car that we had seen driving off just before we arrived. It was. We missed it by THAT much. Also at the shelter tonight is Waldo.

While the first month has had its challenges like the 13° night in the tent, the falls on the ice, the days of climbing over a mile of elevation, and a continuing increase in daily mileage, I feel that we have met every challenge and I’m so thankful to have TheOkie and Jeff From Kansas beside me every step of the way as we all support each other. In the first month, we have hiked 275 AT miles,  I walked 735,490 steps, climbed 66,836 feet, reached the highest point on the AT (Clingman’s Dome 6,644 ft), and hiked in 3 states. We have watched the needle steadily move from 0% to 12% of the trail completed. We continue to meet more great people on and off of the trail and I can’t imagine that there are 3 other hikers out there having more fun and laughs than we are. Last night was an early bedtime in the shelter, as we didn’t make it to sunset. With only 6 people in the shelter, I decided not to go with ear plugs. My optimism was not rewarded however and I wound up grabbing them early in the night. Bambi was the first up and out of the shelter. The rest of us followed him, but he was gone before we had breakfast.  Our initial goal was to hike about 15 miles to the Deer Park Mountain shelter about 3 miles from Hot Springs, North Carolina and then take a NERO (nearly zero miles) on Wednesday. About 2/3 of today’s trail was downhill at a good walkable grade with pretty smooth walking surfaces and we made good time. It threatened rain early, actually sprinkled on us a bit as we hiked by Bailout and Greyhound, and rained on us before we reached the shelter. We decided that after we got water at the shelter area, we would go ahead and hike the last 3 miles in the rain to Hot Springs making it our longest mileage day yet at just over 18 miles.  The lure of town food and a warm, dry place to stay fueled us into town in no time. Hot Springs is truly a trail town in that the AT literally goes down the sidewalk of Main Street. There are even AT symbols permanently embedded in their sidewalk every few yards. Just inside town, we saw the Smoky Mountain Diner and decided to stop in to eat, get out of the rain, and make plans for our lodging. The food and staff were both great at the diner. We asked for recommendations on lodging and they recommended the creek side cottages that we are in tonight because they are clean. Good Soup, another thru hiker we hadn’t met overheard the lodging conversation and let us know he was at a hostel and was very pleased with it. Honestly the deciding factor was that the hostel was 1/4 mile back the direction we had come from and it would mean climbing a large stair embankment every time we returned to the hostel. Even we acknowledge that it’s funny that we’re fine with walking 2,200 miles and climbing over a mile a day, but we don’t want to walk any more non-trail miles than we have to. We considered the diner to be lunch, so we went around the corner from our cottage to a great brick-oven pizza place to have supper. When we walked in, we were greeted by Freyja and Voodoo who we had not seen in over a week. We had a great conversation at the restaurant with the owner who is an avid marathon runner who loves taking care of the hikers that come through. After paying for dinner, we raced a few doors down to where we had earlier seen a sign for ice cream, the most important meal of the day. We made it in just before closing time and ate a cone on the way back to the cottage. The cottage doesn’t have laundry facilities so we warmed the room up and did laundry in the bathtub the best we could. We had to leave a few things out so we’ll have clothes to wear to breakfast if things don’t dry out in time. By this point in the journey, you notice the “hiker hobble” by most people in the shelters. After a high mileage day nearly everyone’s feet have taken a lot of abuse. I’m no different in that regard, but in addition to that, for the last couple of weeks I notice that the bone on the outside edge of my right foot is very tender. When I step on a rock or root that causes that part of my foot to flex, it shoots a pain that causes my knee to buckle. I  noticed yesterday that by making sure my right foot lands flat with each step, I didn’t have any of the knee buckling pains. So today I really focused all day on where I landed with my right foot. With the trail today being pretty smooth, that extra concentration didn’t particularly slow me down. After about 15 miles of staring at the ground two paces ahead to make sure there was a flat landing spot waiting, BAM!!! A tree had recently fallen across the trail at I’m guessing about 5 foot 10 inches high and I ran straight into it with the crown of my head at full stride. Although it didn’t knock me out, I did need the standing 8 count to reassess that I was still in one piece and had all my teeth. As important as that right foot landing spot is, I made sure to glance up every now and then after that!","Roaring Fork Shelter

In the foyer were 6 backpacks. When we were seated, we saw a table with Waldo, Bambi, Good, Oz, Mountain Turtle, and another hiker I didn’t recognize. Waldo said they had gotten up around 5 this morning to cruise into town and take advantage of the town food. After breakfast we stopped by the Dollar General to look at items to resupply. They were out of stock on so many items, it looked like they had been swarmed by locusts or were going out of business. We picked up a few items and dropped by the outfitter to get the rest. In planning out the next resupply into Erwin, Tennessee 68 miles up the trail, the shelter spacing doesn’t line up with the mileage we would prefer. It looks like tomorrow will be a huge 19.5 mile day with well over a mile of climbing. We made it back to the Smoky Mountain Diner for lunch and it was so good we went back to the Smoky Mountain Diner for supper. The plan is to also go there for breakfast about 6:30 in the morning so we can be well nourished and get an early start on the trail. For tonight, it is another warm shower and then catch the weekly Ramdino Thru Hiker update on YouTube before an early bedtime. It has been nice resting up and healing up our bodies, but it is time to start making miles again.","Hot Springs

This was a new record for miles as well as for climbing over 6,000 feet. It was a very eventful day. We started off just after 6 by walking the half mile back down to the Smoky Mountain Diner for our 5th meal there. I half expected a call from the fraud department of the credit card company thinking that the diner had my card and just keeps running charges through. We walked out of Hot Springs, across the bridge over the French Broad River. Soon it was up, up, up from river level to mountain level. About 8 miles into the day, we took the side trail to visit the Rich Mountain Fire Tower. We were thrilled to see that Yukon Rasputon and ZigZag were set up below the fire tower with trail magic. After taking in the awesome fire tower views, we came back down and had chips and a soda as we talked to Yukon about his thru hike in 2009 and his very interesting bicycle trip from Georgia to Maine where he basically paralleled the AT. Fueled in by the trail magic, we hiked another couple of miles to the Spring Mountain Shelter where we stopped to filter water and have a lunch snack. After about 15 miles, we had a special treat as we saw a sign pointing us to a side trail leading us to the “Southern Cookie Lady”.  Even though it was late into a long day, we had to go. It was unbelievable. In front of their awesome looking log cabin, they had large homemade oatmeal cookies for thru hikers. They also had water to refill our bottles and offered to take our trash for us. They were so nice and we had a great conversation and rest with them. Then it was the final push uphill for about 4 miles into camp for the night, the Little Laurel Shelter. It is a smaller shelter, but when we arrived, only Bambi was there, so we got shelter space. Later, Weatherman arrived and set up his tent. We had actually seen him at breakfast at the diner this morning and leapfrogged with him on the trail. He is a very nice doctor from Canada and a great ambassador. Before dark, a section hiker named Tingle made it into camp heading southbound to Hot Springs and is tenting here. We had great conversation around the shelter picnic table. The other interesting thing about this shelter is that from the picnic table you can wave to your friends as they sit just yards away in the worlds shortest privy. Seriously that is like the Shetland pony of privies!  Well again it was a long, hard, beautiful day with great surprises for us. We clicked off 13% of the trail and as our miles keep increasing, that needle will just keep moving. A special thanks to all of the people that have been praying for us on this journey!  Even after walking over 20 miles today, I didn’t have a single knee-buckling pain in my foot. For that, I am very thankful!","Hot Springs

This morning when Jeff from Kansas retrieved the food bags from the bear cables, he made a very disappointing discovery. Through the night a mouse had chewed through his bear bag and proceeded to chew through various items including 8 tortillas, his chicken packets, and saddest of all, his peanut m&m’s. These circus mice had walked the tightrope, navigated through the anti-mouse devices on the wire, dropped down onto our 3 food bags and chose Jeff as the lucky one. We all have plenty of food to make it to Erwin, Tennessee on Sunday, but it is still aggravating. TheOkie had hiked out a special chocolate chip chewy granola bar. We split it 3 ways and I was serenaded with Happy Birthday. Then it was time to hit the trail. Although today’s hike was much shorter it started off right out of the gate going straight up the mountain, no switchbacks.  Eventually it leveled out and we had a lot of nice trail today. One of the highlights was a ridge walk that was very exposed. It was crazy windy up there as we navigated through the jumbled rocks. At the highest point, we stopped and took some epic pictures and videos. When our trail merged with the blue-blazed bad weather trail we hit the 300 mile mark!  There were rocks arranged in the shape of “300”, so we stopped again to take pictures to commemorate the milestone. It rained on us early, but cleared up a lot as the day went on. We spent a lot of the day hiking with Weatherman and he and Jeff had lots of conversation about places they both have visited in Canada. We stopped briefly for a lunch snack and water at the Jerry’s Cabin Shelter and then finished out our day to Flint Mountain Shelter. When we arrived here, Bambi was here with 3 section hikers. Before they all left, I was serenaded with Happy Birthday again. One of the section hikers even offered to take our trash out with her to lighten our loads since she was heading back to civilization. After my birthday dinner of lemon pepper tuna packets on tortillas, we had 3 more thru hikers arrive to share the shelter. Rosie and Barefoot from New Zealand as well as Bluegrass from Georgia. We have now moved the needle to 14% of the trail completed and crossed the 300 mile mark. It was a great day and a great way to spend my birthday.","Little Laurel Shelter

There we were, cornered in the shelter, their teeth gleaming in the night, not really, April Fools!  Jeff From Kansas started it this morning by telling me that in the high winds last night, a tree blew over and collapsed the privy. It actually seemed plausible, and it could definitely happen tonight with wind gusts at the shelter forecast to top out at 75 mph!  
It was raining when we woke up, so we all stayed in the sleeping bags a bit later than usual. By the time we had breakfast and packed up, the rain had stopped and never returned for the day. In fact it turned out to be a spectacular day. 
I had no cell service inside the shelter last night, so I had turned my phone off. When I turned it on and connected to service, I had a message from an old friend, like a childhood friend of 45 years. Ryan Lehman now lives in North Carolina, albeit a 4 hour drive away in North Carolina. In January, over a Folger burger, we discussed him coming out to the trail and walking a day with me. We had no firm plans, but yesterday morning I had a text from him asking our schedule the next few days. This morning I had a text saying that he was at a road crossing 11 miles away from our shelter and would hike toward us until we met. What a great surprise! 
The early hiking had us going up, up, up the mountains, but we did get to cross a large beautiful waterfall. 
About 6 miles into our morning we came over a ridge and there was Ryan. He immediately opened his pack and gave us bananas, candy bars, and Cokes!  What an even greater surprise!  Trail Magic delivered to us up trail!  After a brief visit, we hiked back the 5 miles that he had already hiked, back to his car. After our month of daily hiking in the mountains he said we were like mountain goats. I’m not 100% sure if he was referring to our climbing ability, our smell, or a combination of the two. 
When we reached his car, there was so much more trail magic. We had more Cokes, more candy bars, Lara Bars, Pedialite,water to refill our bottles, and a pound of beef jerky each!  As a special touch, he even had peanut M&M’s for Jeff to replace the ones the mice had viciously destroyed. To top off the trail magic, he had a phone charger and took our trash from us. This was truly an amazing act of trail magic and we hated to see him go!!  
Ironically, as we crossed the road and re-entered the trail we were offered trail magic of donuts and Mountain Dew and to our horror, we had to decline. We were just too full from Ryan taking such great care of us. 
We still had 8 miles left to get to the shelter. We really were counting on being one of the first 10 people there to have a spot inside because of the threat of hurricane force winds blowing down trees. We hiked hard, fueled by all of the treats we had consumed. About two miles from the end, we came across an unattended trail magic cooler filled with bags of cookies. A few cookies got us up to the top of Big Bald Mountain. 
It was exhilarating up there!  The wind was probably blowing 60 mph unobstructed. It would literally blow you over if you were not braced against it. Below the bald, the trees were swaying and creaking. That was more frightening than exhilarating. After crossing the bald, we raced down to the shelter and got there just behind Weatherman, so we all grabbed spaces inside. 
Shortly, Rosie and Barefoot arrived and Bluegrass, a large man just arrived and said that the wind actually blew him to to his back like a helpless turtle. There is one couple here, tenting. They said they’ve had a bad experience with mice in the shelters. I guess SO FAR they’ve never had a bad experience  having a tree blown onto their tent. 
Tonight we will sleep with our water filters and bottles, because in addition to the 75 mph winds, it is expected to reach 26° for the low. It was another hard, but beautiful day walking over 19 miles and climbing over 6,400 feet.  Jeff From Kansas and I would also like to wish TheOkie his very special one month anniversary on the trail.  After my supper of beef jerky, it is time for bed.","Flint Mountain Shelter

“It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.” -Confucius 
Last night shortly after getting settled into my sleeping bag, I was holding my phone and working on my journal. I heard some scratching noises, but with the high winds, I didn’t really think much of it. Then I felt a mouse run across my head. I swiped at him and flung him away. TheOkie also experienced a mouse on the head and Weatherman reported that while watching something on his phone, he saw a mouse silhouette run across his screen. To my knowledge, no one had any mouse damage this morning. Maybe he was just curious about the folks that showed up to spend the night with him in his shelter. 
We did ride the windstorm out successfully in the shelter. Thankfully the 75 mph winds were hitting the solid back wall of the shelter and not aimed into the open front of the shelter. It did get down to 26° overnight and we woke to quite a beautiful sight. After the winds died down and the cold moved in, all of the trees were coated in frost, making them look like crystal with the sun shining on them against the background of blue skies. 
It was cold packing up and starting out this morning, but soon the trail led us to a climb to warm us up. Before long we were shedding layers.  We leapfrogged with Rosie and Barefoot from New Zealand as well as Weatherman, Joker, and Bluegrass. 
Today was Jeff From Kansas’ day to lead. He was doing a great job when all of a sudden he found himself astride the first snake we have seen on the trail.  Now I’m not saying he did as big of a snake dance as I will when I step near a snake, but he definitely did alert TheOkie and me to the snake’s presence. 
Jeff had some leg pain today that was really aggravated by hiking downhill. He finally urged us to go on ahead so he could walk at his pace. Reluctantly, TheOkie & I hiked on up to the next shelter that was 2 miles away. We had barely been there when Jeff showed up. The bad leg didn’t slow him down that much at all which was great. From there to our ending point was another 6 miles.   Again he urged us to go ahead. 
The hike had several great views from the cliffs above Erwin and the Nolichucky River. We even saw a train cross the river before it headed back through the mountains. When we arrived at the Nolichucky River at the edged of Erwin, Tennessee, I bet Jeff wasn’t 5 minutes behind us. Talk about playing through the pain and not quitting, he barely flinched. 
Right as TheOkie & I made our way out of the woods and to the road, an answer to prayer in the form of Steve of Unicoi Shuttles showed up asking if we needed a ride. By the time he turned his car around and parked, Jeff was coming out of the woods. Steve shuttled us to the Super8 in Erwin, where we will resupply, do laundry, eat town food, and rest our weary feet and legs. We started off better on the eating than we did on the resting. We walked the half mile to McDonald’s where TheOkie and I each had 2 Double Quarter Pounders, but only 1 order of fries. It really hit the spot. 
Back at the Super8, we took showers that had only 2 settings:  totally hot or totally cold. I can’t handle the cold, so scalding it was. Then we did laundry with real machines and soap!  We will for sure smell like day-hikers at least until the first uphill climb Tuesday. 
We hiked this last section of 70 miles from Hot Springs, pretty aggressively. Today we moved the needle to another milestone: 15% of the trail completed!  We’re getting there. We now need to decide on our plan to get us to our next resupply in Hampton, Tennessee about 80 miles away. We should be there for Easter if all goes well.","Bald Mountain Shelter

“Rest when you’re weary. Refresh and renew yourself, your body, your mind, your spirit. Then get back to work.” -Ralph Marston The photo is of the different types of wildflowers we saw during March. Some days we see lots of them and some days we see none. I hope that they are correct with their optimism about the arrival of spring!This morning after breakfast, the nice folks at the Super8 allowed us to change rooms to one with a working shower. It’s not hard to pick up and move when all of your possessions fit neatly into one bag. The morning was spent with more planning and logistics. Normally we are just planning to the next resupply town, but we have a big incentive to plan out through the middle of the month. My wife and TheOkie’s wife plan to come out for a visit.  I think they are mostly coming to see us, although the ponies of the Grayson Highlands in southern Virginia are a pretty good draw as well. When the wives are here, we will probably take a mixture of zero days and days where we will hike a full length day and be picked up and taken back to town for an evening with family. That could really spoil us.After calls to family, we got a shuttle from G-Man since Steve wasn’t available. He took us to Primo’s Italian restaurant and actually joined us for lunch. He hiked the first 1/4 of the trail and loved it so much he moved to Erwin and bought a house 3 houses off of the trail. He took us to Walmart where we got food for the next 5 days. Then a quick trip to an outfitter in an unsuccessful search for permethrin to protect us from ticks. This 5 days will be the most food we’ve had to pack out at a resupply and the food bags sure feel heavy. Tomorrow’s 17 mile hike to Cherry Gap Shelter will have over a mile of elevation gain again but we’ll be well fed and rested. Hope that helps!  We got a nap in this afternoon and then walked the half mile over to the grocery store where we bought supper from their deli case. I had a 1 lb chef salad and 2 ham and cheese sandwiches. I washed it down with a Dr. Enuf Cherry Herbal Soda. G-Man had told us about the regionally produced soda and they had them in the machine at the store. It had ginseng and guarana in it and actually a really good cherry flavor. I would definitely drink it again if I ran across one. Now it’s time to shower with the water temperature of my choosing, (I hope) and get some sleep before we get shuttled back to the trail in the morning.","Erwin, Tennessee

Jeff From Kansas dropped by the room on his way to McDonald’s this morning, then TheOkie and I went down for the bagel and donut Super8 breakfast. Steve, the shuttle driver texted us that G-MAN could take us back to the trail a little earlier than we originally planned. We were dropped off at Uncle Johnny’s Hostel right around 8:30. 
With over 17 miles and a mile of climbing on the day, we hit the trail and hiked across the Nolichucky River. About 8 miles into our day, we came to a road crossing. As we approached the road, we could see a pickup parked there with an umbrella and chairs. Trail Magic! When we got there, who should be sitting there, but Bambi. He is back on trail and still has a nose for finding trail magic. I was given a lemonade, a slice of cranberry bread, and refilled my water bottle with cold water from the water jug. How nice!  
When we started back hiking up the mountain, we ran into several hikers coming downhill toward us. We came across 2 trail maintainers out with their saw and loppers, looking for blowdowns. Then it was up, up, up to Beauty Spot, a bald mountain at about 4,500 feet with spectacular 360° views. After a few pictures there we hiked down the other side to a water source that was guarded by Piper the dog. Luckily, Elsa, the dog’s human had a strong hold on the leash. After Jeff From Kansas gave the dog some beef jerky, it reluctantly let us pass by to fill our water bottles. 
There was considerably more climbing in store for us as we powered up Unaka Mountain at about 5,200 feet. As we neared the top of the mountain, we again entered a magical zone of emerald moss carpeting everything. Where the light beams penetrated the tall spruces, you could see the trees’ trunks  carried the same green tones. The accumulation of needles on the ground made a springy walking surface which is my favorite treadway on the trail. Much better than the rocks and roots we walked on most of today. 
About 4:30, we made it to the Cherry Gap Shelter where Bambi and Easy Money were waiting. We all ate dinner as Jack Of Most Trades and Fixit arrived as well as Elsa and Piper.  The piped spring by the shelter is the best water source we’ve had. It would fill your 2 liter water bladder in about 2 seconds. This shelter will only sleep about 5 people. It doesn’t have bear cables or a privy, so we will be hanging out bear bags from a tree. 
It was a hot day, with lots of sweating, but is a comfortable 68 in the shelter now.  Another hard but beautiful day on the AT, where we have moved the needle to 16%!","Nolichucky River

Well today we hiked through the Pisgah National Forest and it reminded me of a couple of families that moved from this area of North Carolina to my hometown years ago. Our paths were intertwined in many ways as they were our church family, in my work family, and classmates with my son. Currently, one of their sons is in a battle against cancer. He’s a fighter and has great doctors in his corner, but I have a favor to ask. I know that many of you are praying for me on this journey. I would ask that you also pray for Spencer as he fights this terrible disease. I know that his family would appreciate knowing that all of us are in his corner. 
This morning, the Bambi alarm went off early in the shelter as he was anxious to hike to a place he could get into Erwin to try and heal up a large area of chafing where his backpack has rubbed him raw.  We got up and hit the trail. 
We stopped around noon at the Clyde Smith Shelter to get water and have a snack. The water source was about 250 steps downhill from the shelter. After eating, drinking, and visiting with Jack OMT and Papa Smurf, we started back on the trail. At one point, we were met on the trail by Shooting Star all dressed out in her coordinated pink. She is a MYTH, Multi Year Thru Hiker, having completed about 1,500 miles of the trail by hiking different sections 1 week a month. She offered us Trail Magic from her little ziplock bag labeled “Magic”.  Jeff From Kansas was given a slice of pineapple she had dehydrated herself, TheOkie was given a little tablet sized towel that expands when you put it in water, and I was given a packet of Liquid IV to add to a bottle of water. It was a special encounter on the trail. 
The last part of the day consisted of lots of climbing. About 15 miles in, we reached a Tentsite that we had originally targeted. We stopped there to get water from their water source. Their water source was 350 steps downhill from the Tentsite. After a quick snack, we were back off for more climbing.  
We spent a lot of time in the beautiful green, moss-covered wonderland going up, up, up. Today had over a mile of climbing again. The payoff for the climbing was reaching the Roan Mountain High Knob Shelter, the highest shelter on the AT at 6,270 feet. We got here early enough to get spots on the downstairs of this unique, lofted, enclosed shelter. 
After a tuna and tortilla dinner, it was time to collect water for tomorrow. The water source was, you guessed it, a downhill walk from the shelter. So even though the water walks don’t count in our official mileage we still moved the imaginary needle to the 17% mark today. 
We really hit the wall on the climbs at the end of the day and had to dig deep to keep going. In today’s battle of the wills, I’m proud that the three of us overcame the obstacles the mountain presented.","Cherry Gap Shelter

That was not to be the case. Someone in the shelter was apparently set on getting an early start and started packing up about 6:30. Soon others began to follow and we were all up and on our way a bit earlier than usual. Since the shelter had a door, we didn’t hang our bear bags outside. Instead, we kept them inside where the biggest threat was mice. I’m happy to report that it appears we were not visited by the little critters at this shelter. The forecast called for rain and thunderstorms throughout the day. We started off with rain jackets which helped with the cool wind. About a mile down the mountain, we stopped in another beautiful green moss covered spruce forest to shed the jackets. About a mile and a half down the huge mountain we came to a road crossing at Carver’s Gap where we spied a former thru hiker named Jarod doing trail magic!  We stopped to visit and had a Gatorade and rice krispy snack. He was so appreciative of the trail magic he received on his hike that he now likes to travel to places on the trail and pay it back. That is definitely something that the 3 of us look forward to doing in the future. Fueled with the extra calories, it was time to attack the first of the day’s climbs, Round Bald at 5807 feet. The views from the top were incredible. One of the views however, was of rain clouds headed to where we were going. So we put our rain jackets back on and headed a few hundred feet downhill. Before we started the climb to Jane Bald also at 5807 feet, off came the rain jackets for the final time of the day. Next after descending to about 4500 feet where we saw the iconic Overmountain Shelter, a large red barn that had been a popular shelter, but is now destined for destruction, we climbed Little Hump Mountain at 5445 feet. Then it was down again and then the huge climb up Hump Mountain at 5559 feet.  The views from all of these tough climbs made it worthwhile.  We really felt blessed that crossing all of these wide open mountain tops on a day with thunderstorms in the forecast, we never even had a sprinkle of rain up there. The last part of the day was down, down, down. When we finally made it to the road crossing at US 19E, we didn’t really have a plan. We wanted to stay indoors if possible because of the continued rain and storm forecast. A hostel owner showed up to pick up hikers at the parking area we were sitting at. When we inquired about availability, he said that everything around was booked up. There was a sticker on the guardrail with the phone number of The Refuge Hostel. It was not one of the hostels we had heard of, but I gave them a call. They said they could pick us up in 10 minutes. We weren’t really sure what we were getting in to, but you talk about another answer to prayers!  When we mentioned we were hungry, they dropped us by the Mexican restaurant in town. I had chicken fajitas that were much better than the tuna packets I had planned on. It was really good town food and hit the spot. An hour later they picked us up and drove us the short distance to the hostel.  They took us in and showed us around.  There are 8 bunks, a bathroom with a toilet and shower, washer and dryer, a resupply closet where you can buy popular backpacking foods, a freezer with ready to eat meals for purchase, and a common area with movies, games, and musical instruments. All of this for $20 a night!  As if things couldn’t get any better, they will drop us off in the morning where they picked us up and will pick us back up at a road crossing 13.7 miles up the trail and bring us back for one more night in this awesome place. The owners, Robert and April are avid hikers and live above the hostel. They came down and visited with us for about an hour and were super nice people. So even though we didn’t really have a plan, we weren’t worried and things turned out great!  Now we have had showers and are lounging in our loaner clothes, the only 3 people in the hostel tonight. The other eventful happening today is that at mile 392.3 we reached Doll Flats, the final spot of the trail in North Carolina, so 2 states completed and only 12 more to go!  As you may recall, the AT follows the border between North Carolina and Tennessee for many miles. We have been in both states since before Newfound Gap in the Smokies, sometimes in both states several times a day without even knowing which one. But now we hike solely in Tennessee until we reach Virginia at mile 467.  We continue to have a great time and feel very blessed to be on this journey.","Roan High Knob Shelter

As per usual, right away there was a steep incline where the trail entered the woods from the road. Only today it was different. We powered right up that hill without the normal huffing and puffing!  It seems that the 30 pounds we typically carry on our back DOES have an effect on us. Who knew?!?!  In addition to strolling up and down the hills with considerably less effort, we noticed another benefit. Although today’s treadway was generally well above average, when we did walk on rocks and roots, it didn’t seem to hurt our feet the same. Could the extra weight we typically carry compound the effect on our feet of the miles we walk?  I think I could get real used to this slackpacking!  At a minimum it makes me think of items in my backpack that I could send home to reduce my pack weight. It really does make that much difference. Today’s walk was in a beautiful area, but early on, the much forecast rains finally developed and we wound up walking in the rain for about 4 hours. When the rain first started, we were in a huge grove of giant pine trees. Their canopy gave us great coverage as we put on our rain jackets and TheOkie and I donned our hands-free umbrellas.  I seemed to get the umbrella adjusted easier than in the past, which was nice.  The trail was pretty open throughout the day and we were able to use the umbrellas without too much interference from trees. There were a few highlights today. The first happened 4.7 miles in when we reached the 400 mile mark!   These miles also moved our needle to the 18% mark.  There is just something about rolling off the hundreds and state lines that makes you feel like you are making real progress!  After a round of fist bumps and a few photos, we were off to the next highlight, a short side trail to the Jones Falls. This enormous waterfall tumbled and cascaded down multiple layers of rock outcroppings.  It has a powerful roar that you could just feel. Back on trail, we hiked until we came to Mountaineer Falls. It was a large powerful waterfall that was literally right on the trail. We stood at the base of that fall, taking it in as we ate a midday snack. Walking on wet leaves, wet roots, and mud all day once again reminded us how slick things can be and how fast your trip can be in jeopardy. When we reached the appointed road with cell signal, we texted the hostel so they would know when to pick us up at our final destination. When we arrived there, Robert was waiting. It felt good to get in the warm, dry vehicle. When we returned to the hostel, we quickly took turns taking showers and then did all of our laundry. It is very good to be inside and have dry clothes to start the day in tomorrow. At 5:00 April took us into town to have a dinner of town food. We chose the BBQ restaurant. I had the half pound platter of pulled pork with rolls, fries, and beans. I also had Jeff From Kansas’ beans and one of TheOkie’s ribs. I told them that if I didn’t already know that I would get town food again the next two days, I would go and order another dinner. There are scales at the hostel and I weighed for the first time since leaving home.   Even with all of the eating, I have still lost a considerable amount of weight already. As we left the restaurant, there was a Dr. Enuf vending machine, so I am all set for breakfast tomorrow. Back at the hostel, Piper and her human Elsa have joined us. Now that Piper isn’t guarding the water, she has been much more tolerant of us. She has even let us pet her when she isn’t sleeping from her hard day of hiking in the rain. While hiking in the rain today, we ran across Checkmate, Daydream, and the couple Jo, Kerry, and their dog Felix. We had crossed paths with Jo, Kerry & Felix coming out of Erwin. When we visited with them today, we found out that they are also journaling on Trailjournals. April  and Robert came down for another nice long visit which was a great time. They also brought down no-bake cookies and donuts for us to share. This really has been such a comfortable and welcoming hostel experience and we are so glad we wound up here. Early on we decided when it rains we could be wet and miserable, or we could just be wet. We all agreed today that we were glad that we were just wet.","US 19E

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661786,"“Raindrops keep falling on my head.” -B J Thomas I was so glad to have a nice warm, dry place to sleep last night. I can’t stress enough what a blessing The Refuge Hostel has been to us these last few days. This morning when we got up we had to repack the entire backpack, have our Dr. Enuf and Jimmy Dean breakfast, and get ready for Robert to take us back to the trail by 8:45. We accomplished that and were shuttled back to the spot we finished at yesterday. After a picture and our goodbyes, we headed off into the woods on a cold, damp morning. Today was primarily an elevation loss, but don’t let that fool you. So far the AT hasn’t done anything the easy way. Even on a day of down, down, down, the trail threw in enough straight up climbs to remind you who is boss. About a mile and a half in, we came across the Hardcore Cascades waterfall. The section of trail the last two days has been spectacular for waterfall viewing. The rain started spitting at us and after about an hour, we hiked up to the Moreland Gap Shelter which was right on trail.  Since it was raining harder, we stopped in and got our rain gear out under the protective awning of the shelter. Today, in addition to my rain jacket, I put on my rain pants, which turned out to be a good move. Although it wasn’t raining as hard as yesterday, it was raining, 33°, and gusting wind on top of the mountains. The rain pants helped keep me dry AND warm. I again used the umbrella until I encountered an area of blowdowns that I couldn’t get around or through with the umbrella on. From then on I only used it off and on. As we got to lower elevation, the temperature rose slightly, but the wind calmed significantly making it feel much nicer.  Our mileage today moved our needle to 19% of the trail completed. When we reached the Dennis Cove Road, TheOkie’s younger brother was there waiting for us. Not only did he drive all the way out here from Oklahoma to spend Easter with us, he showed up with Trail Magic!  As soon as we got to him, he was handing out soft drinks, candy, and other goodies. Then it was straight into town to hit a late lunch of town food. After eating a huge lunch, it was off to check in to our rooms for the next two nights. Once in our room, we started planning out our resupply needs to get us to Damascus, Virginia. Then it was a great FaceTime with the family and our neighbors back home. Quite an uplifting day to this point.  Then we headed to a grocery store for a few resupply items. After that we went in search of more Dr. Enuf sodas for the next 2 days.  Having been successful in that quest, we went to the Texas Roadhouse where I had a filet, salad, baked sweet potato, and rolls. I’ve got to get those town meals in to slow the weight loss. I am so appreciative of TheOkie’s brother for taking the time to come out and support us. Tomorrow he will take us to Easter church services before he turns around and drives all the way back to Oklahoma. That is really going above and beyond in the trail magic category!","FS 293

He is not here, but has risen.”‭‭Luke‬ ‭24‬:‭5‬-‭6 After a great night’s sleep, I went downstairs to see what the breakfast selections looked like. I returned to my room with 2 breakfast bars, a banana, and 2 Hostess Ding Dongs. Now you add in your Dr. Enuf Cherry Herbal Soda and you are ready to take on the day! After a shower and putting on my clean hiker clothes, I joined TheOkie as his brother took us to the Johnson City Central Church of Christ. It was a cool, absolutely beautiful morning outside as we made the short drive from the hotel. Walking through the parking lot and into the nice church building you could see the dogwoods and other trees in full bloom. Actually everything seems greener down here than it has up higher in the mountains so far. The service was very nice with congregational hymns and a message on the eyewitnesses of the resurrection. After church, TheOkie’s brother treated us to lunch at Cootie Browns, a restaurant half a mile from the hotel. TheOkie and I both ordered the jumbo pulled pork bbq sandwich that came with slaw on top of the meat. We both agreed that the sandwich was great, but their idea of jumbo is not the same as a thru hiker’s idea of jumbo. They also had fresh made desserts, so we brought back carrot cake and key lime pie to the room.  After lunch, TheOkie’s brother headed back to Oklahoma. We really appreciate everything he did for us in his short time here. I don’t envy all of the driving he has done this weekend. While it is the best hiking weather we have seen in several days, we are far away from the trail. That being the case, we closed the blinds and caught up on a little napping to rest up for the big days coming up. Then more snacking and repacking and a nice FaceTime with all the family gathered for Easter. Finally we took an Uber to go get our last big town food meal. Tomorrow morning, Jeff From Kansas has lined up a shuttle driver to take us back to where we left the trail.  This will be a big week coming up as we knock out another state.","Johnson City, Tennessee

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661867,"“Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink.” - Samuel Taylor Coleridge This morning our shuttle took us from Johnson City back to the Dennis Cove Trailhead. We were met there by Emoji, a trail angel and poet. She had us look in her car’s trunk. It looked like a resupply closet and a snack shop. I didn’t really need anything, but took a small fruit snack. She also gave each of us a copy of a different poem she had written. When we started walking, it was on beautiful trail following a stream. Before long we reached the rock stairs leading to Laurel Falls. The falls were spectacular!  A very wide falls powerfully gushing water. We took lots of pictures and then moved on. As we followed the trail downstream, at one point it turned into a narrow rock ledge about 2 feet wide with the river on one side and the steep rock wall on the other. We continued on across 2 bridges and eventually turned to go up into the mountains. We climbed and climbed until we topped out on Pond Mountain. Eventually Watauga Lake came into view. We hiked around one side of it at the top of the mountain, and then reversed course as we descended and hiked back around the other side of it. We stopped at a nice swim beach picnic area and had a bit of lunch before we left, Globetrotter also stopped by to eat.  We then hiked on around the lake to the dam. After we crossed the dam there was supposed to be a water source, but it didn’t appear. From that point it was about 5 more miles to water. It was warm and dry and we were conserving the little water we were carrying. We could constantly see the beautiful emerald green waters of the lake far below the ridge line we were hiking, but no water to drink. When we reached a spring, we all immediately filtered and drank a liter of water and then filtered another liter to go, as well as filled our water bladders. About 2 miles later we made it to the shelter. After throwing our bags out to claim our spots, we sat on a rock outcropping overlooking the lake and had supper. Now our bear bag is hung and it is time to get in the bag for the evening. We are sharing the shelter with Monkey Toes, a section hiker.  We hiked past Superior, who we had not seen since Cold Spring Shelter. We also met Freyja and Voodoo at the dam as they were slackpacking SOBO. We have reserved spots in Damascus, Virginia for Wednesday night since the bubble of hikers is growing and hostels are filling up.","Dennis Cove Road

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661894,"“All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.” - Walt Disney This morning, the shelter was awakened just after 6 by a peculiar bird that incessantly sang his song directly at us. On repeat. At high volume. We didn’t rouse just then, but soon enough we were facing the chilly morning and getting ready for the day’s hike. The terrain was not bad today, by AT standards. We made it nearly 7 miles to the Iron Mountain Shelter where we stopped for water and an early lunch. When we arrived, there was a deer just casually grazing by the shelter. Also at the shelter was a friendly couple that we visited with. Upon the subject of our lives before retirement, we found out that he was the deputy commissioner for the North Carolina State Banking Department. We had some common acquaintances and let him know how much we liked our State Banking Department friends. Monkey Toes caught up with us at lunch and hiked out with us. It was interesting to hear about her previous 2 long sections of the trail that she had hiked. We had discussed last night that since today was our 6 week anniversary on the trail, that we had been told that was the period of time for our trail boot camp. We expected the Trail fairy to bring us our trail legs last night. The uphills were still tough and we still huffed and puffed, so we thought maybe we got skipped. But after hiking a number of miles with us, Monkey Toes said that we definitely had our trail legs. I guess that the fact we are able to make the climbs quickly and efficiently is lost on us because it still hurts and we still huff and puff. Maybe we got our trail legs and now we just need our trail lungs to go with them. At one point today, after staring across the mountain ranges, an impromptu sing along of Country Roads happened. While it will take us a month to get to West Virginia, it might be in some of the mountains that we saw. About 12 miles into the day, we came to a road crossing and were summoned over to a table and some chairs by Sheepdog and Shutterbug. We tried not to sprint at the sight of trail magic!  I had an ice cold Coke and a bag of Funyuns. Now I couldn’t even tell you what decade I last ate Funyuns, but today they sounded good. It was really nice to have flavor. At their insistence, not that much insistence was needed, I also had a sausage biscuit. Then a chocolate chip cookie (with pecans!).  Then a clementine. Then after filling my water bottle and taking my trash, they sent me off with a Coke for tonight. Such wonderful trail magic late in the day when we really needed a pick me up!  The next treat was the trail. We entered a pasture where the trail was literally a gravel path through a scenic rolling farm field. It was as if, for a change, the AT wasn’t trying to kill us. In the beautiful green pasture was a large barn sporting the iconic AT logo on it. It was such a nice setting for a walk. After leaving the pasture, we returned to the woods for a climb to tonight’s shelter. Even this climb wasn’t that harsh by AT standards. For the day, we only climbed about 3000 feet which is much better than our recent usual. Another milestone today was crossing the 20% mark!  That needle just keeps climbing and today it hit a real number again on the imaginary dial. Today was another absolutely beautiful day weather wise. I would also recommend the section between Dennis Cove Road and Damascus for someone looking to do a short section of the trail. So much to see and although parts would be hard, from what we’ve seen, I can’t think of a section that long that would be as easy.","Vandeventer Shelter

Even though the conversation around the picnic table outside the shelter was great, I just couldn’t hang in there. I did however wake up about 10:00 in a full sweat. I shed my sleep socks and sleep shirt and unzipped my sleeping bag down to the knees. I really wouldn’t have been surprised if it had been morning and time to get up. Before I went back to sleep I heard critters tap dancing on the shelter’s metal roof just above my head. I won’t say they were mice because I didn’t actually see them and also I don’t want my sister to quit following my journal because I cause her to have mice nightmares. Before actual time to get up, I was cold in the sleeping bag and had to zip it back up. We actually got up later than we planned to, packed up, ate a few breakfast bars and hit the trail. Today was a pretty high mileage day and the trail was more favorable than not. It was beautiful weather and warmed up quickly. Much like Saul, we were on the road to Damascus. Even with all of these factors in our favor, it was still a tough day and our feet got weary before we got to our destination. But today was also a big day of milestones. Early in the day, the needle budged off of the 20% mark and now sits at 21%. But the even bigger news is that at trail mile 467, we completed our 3rd state with 11 states to go.  Tennessee is in the rear view mirror and we are now in Virginia.  I guess it’s looking like Steven Wright was on to something. I guess you really can walk anywhere if you have enough time. Since beginning the trail, I have taken 1,198,795 steps according to my phone! As we left Tennessee and entered Virginia, we were ready to get to Damascus. Damascus is known as Trail Town USA and is home to the annual Trail Days event where hikers from all years come back for a sort of reunion. Once we finally made it down the mountain into town, we walked under the iconic welcome arch and stopped for a few pictures. Then it was a walk through town where the Main Street sidewalk is the official AT. At the far end of town, we turned off trail for 2 blocks where we came to Lady Di’s B&B, our home for the night. After leaving our packs and shoes on the front porch, we were given a tour of the home turned hostel. The 3 of us are in a somewhat private room, other than it is the passageway to the upstairs sitting porch and the loaner clothes are in our closet.  After a very welcome shower, we dropped our hiking clothes in the provided basket to have them laundered. Then it was time to walk in search of food. Food options In Damascus are quite limited. We walked down the road to the Wicked Chicken.  Micro and her dog Matilda were sitting at a table by themselves, so JFK (Jeff From Kansas) invited them to join us. We enjoyed hearing about her experiences on the trail through the years. I had a double fried egg with bacon sandwich, pulled pork slider, and fries.  After everyone finished their meal, Micro insisted on treating us to ice cream at the adjacent ice cream shop. That was very kind of her and we all appreciated it very much. I had a scoop of lemon sorbet and it was very good. As we walked back to the B&B, the sun was setting and it was cooling off outside. When we arrived, we dutifully left our shoes on the porch and came inside to prepare for bed. The plan for tomorrow is to take care of resupply chores in the morning and hike out to a shelter in the early afternoon.","Double Spring Shelter

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662028,"“When you miss the target, never in history has it been the target's fault.”After sleeping in a bed, I put my laundered clothes on my clean body and walked downstairs and had a great breakfast at a real table. The French toast casserole with blueberries, pecans, and maple syrup was particularly delicious. We had originally thought we would take a zero In Damascus, but changed our mind and decided on a NERO day.  A Nero is when we do our town chores and hike nearly no miles, although a 9 mile day might not really qualify. We walked to the post office where JFK was able to mail a few items home to lower his pack weight. We then walked a few miles round trip to the local grocery store where we were able to resupply food for the next 4 days. On the way back to the B&B, we stopped in the new Appalachian Trail Conservancy visitor center. The lady working there was very friendly and we enjoyed looking around at the photos and exhibits. We were able to sign the log book like we sign the shelter log at the shelters we stay in. Back at Lady Di’s, we sorted our meals, packed our packs, and had our picture taken by Lady Di. Then we headed off on the trail. We made it a solid quarter of a mile before we walked in to a Subway and each had a foot long sub. The initial plan was to eat half a sub and pack out half for later. But, there were no survivors. For a short way, the trail followed the Virginia Creeper trail. It is a rail trail that is now used for lots of biking. After we split off and started climbing up the mountain, we could see lots of people coasting back to town on the Creeper trail. When we reached the shelter it was 87° and we were hot and thirsty. We hiked down to the spring which was flowing fast. We immediately filtered and drank a liter of water and then refilled our bottles and our water bags and had some snacks. After setting up our sleeping bags in the shelter, we visited with the 3 section hikers that are tenting near the shelter. At dinner time I had bbq chicken packets on flour tortillas that were quite good. I also had an apple that I bought for the Grayson ponies and carried the 9 miles today. I opted not to carry the half pound apple another 20 miles, but did save them the core. I would feel worse about this decision except I’m sure when our wives come out next week, we will take many more apples to the ponies. Today was another milestone. The FarOut app that we use for navigation has the AT maps broken up in sections. Damascus was the end of the second section, so we started the Southern Virginia section today. According to the maps, from Springer Mountain Georgia to Damascus Virginia we have walked 471 miles and have ascended  112,907 feet. In other words, we have climbed the equivalent of over 21 miles!  That would be a long ladder!  Now that we are in Virginia, the shelters again have privies. There are conflicting stories as to why the Tennessee shelters didn’t have privies. *For anyone uncomfortable with bathroom talk, have a pleasant evening and please scroll on ahead to the Day 46 entry tomorrow.* In Tennessee, even camping at shelters we had to dig a cat hole when we needed to go to the bathroom. We’ll, that is unless you used the method Bambi said he was using. That method was to take Imodium and hope to make it to the next resupply town. Now I THINK Bambi was joking, but we have not seen or heard from him since shortly after leaving Erwin, Tennessee. I am proud to report that I hit the cat hole first try on 3 of my 5 attempts. You don’t get a second attempt. Instead, you have to do a bit of maneuvering with whatever sticks are in reach.  Speaking of sticks, TheOkie and I always left a stick protruding from the cat hole when done to discourage others from digging in the same space and finding buried treasure. I felt that towards the end, my aim was improving. It seems to be an acquired skill.  Now I’m not bragging, but in all other states that provide privies, I am 100% on hitting the hole first try. I’m not sure what the situation will be in the upcoming 10 states, but if any of them are like Tennessee, I hope that my training there will pay off.","Damascus, Virginia

Put blinders on and plow right ahead.” -George Lucas We woke up in the shelter to the sound of rain hitting the metal roof. I’ve always liked that sound, but now I like it because it means I don’t have to take down a wet tent and pack up in the rain.  There was cell service at the shelter which was a bonus, because we could pull up radar and see that the rain would end about 8:00. That was perfect. More rain was predicted throughout the day, but miraculously the storms parted, raining east of us and west of us, but it never even sprinkled where we were hiking. That was particularly appreciated because much of the day was spent stepping from rock to rock as we climbed the mountain. That kind of hiking really takes a toll on your feet snd mine were ready to be done after a long day. I do feel that my balance has improved with all of the rock hopping which is nice. This morning we did have a pleasant stretch where the AT joined the Virginia Creeper Trail on a nice wide chat path on a reasonable grade. On this part of the trail we crossed a long bridge. It was my day to lead, so I was the first to spot the 3 foot long bull snake sunning itself on the bridge railing. My good herpetologist friend would be proud of me for not doing my snake dance. Later we stopped in at Lost Mountain Shelter to get water and have a snack for lunch. Just outside the shelter, JFK looked down beside his feet and there was another 3 foot long bull snake. He didn’t do a snake dance either. I would bet that there are precious few mice at the Lost Mountain Shelter!  As we hiked in, I was definitely looking for snakes on the trail, but we didn’t see any others. Todays weather turned out to be ideal hiking weather. The temperature never rose like yesterday, there were light breezes, and although we were thankful to not be rained on, we were also thankful that the sun wasn’t beating down on us all day. I would take a lot more days with this weather. The treadway was actually pretty good the first half of the day, but that deteriorated severely later in the afternoon. We had some outstanding views from buzzard rock, and Mount Rogers. The rain clouds surrounding us made for great photos. As we got near the shelter, we saw evidence of the ponies that we expect to see in the Grayson Highlands tomorrow. In fact we saw at least 4 large piles of evidence directly on the trail. It appears at least one pony knows where a break in the fence is. The shelter tonight is a nice, large double decker. The water source, a piped spring is WAY down the hill behind the shelter. The bear box may actually e far enough away from the shelter that we passed 500 miles getting there. The privy is another fine example of Virginia craftsmanship. At supper, JFK had a special treat for us as we are within one mile of celebrating 500 miles in the trail. He packed out a huge summer sausage and Ritz crackers from Damascus two days ago. The three of us devoured the special treat after a hard nine hour hike.   Carrying that extra weight up these mountains was a sacrifice and TheOkie and I both greatly appreciated it. Early tomorrow morning we will hit a big milestone, but for today, we moved that needle to the 22% mark. When we arrived at the shelter, Good Soup was here along with a couple of other hikers. After we had dinner, Trail Bob and his daughter Brightside made it to camp. They are from Wisconsin and have been at the same shelter with us a few times. Before bedtime, Fairy Trails from Mexico and a friend of hers who is just visiting her on the trail came in. It hasnow started to rain outside and as I sit in my sleeping bag typing this entry, I can once again hear the pleasing sound of a soft rain on the metal roof of the shelter.","Saunders Shelter

Eventually we all got dressed, fed, went to the superb Virginia privy, packed up and headed out. One mile in, we came upon the big milestone we were looking for. The 500 mile mark memorialized in stone. This brought about fist bumps and a stop for pictures. We asked a passing day hiker to take our picture which they did. They also mentioned a better 500 spelled out in rocks up ahead. So off we hiked and again stopped for pictures at the next 500. And the next. And the next. Eventually we passed all of the 500 mile mark signs and were on to the next highlight of the day, the Grayson Highland Ponies. These free roaming wild ponies are not afraid of people, so we could get close enough for some good pictures.  They are definitely a highlight of the trail and I have been looking forward to actually seeing them for many years. Eventually we hiked on and left the ponies.  Later in another area, we saw a pony  and shortly after, we saw a mother with a baby pony. That was a nice treat. Midway through the day, we reached The Scales. We stopped in this giant corral with a nice short grass carpeting and had a lunch snack while we sat in the sun. About a mile later we stopped at a small spring to water up for the rest of the hike. The terrain was not too difficult today, but the treadway was again very, very rocky. After the morning fog burned off, it was another absolutely beautiful day for hiking. We have definitely been blessed with great weather the last few days.

In that time, I have learned about a lot of quirky things that I’ve been looking forward to experiencing on my journey. Yesterday we saw the Grayson ponies which was a major highlight. Today, we hiked to the Partnership Shelter. Now it’s certainly a nice double decker shelter, but that’s not what makes it special. The quirky thing I’ve been looking forward to at this shelter is the fact that 100 yards down the trail is the Mount Rogers visitor center. On the outside wall of the visitor center is a phone. Next to the phone is a menu for a pizza place that delivers. So, when you stay at the Partnership Shelter you can actually have hot fresh pizza and a cold soda delivered to you. As a hungry thru hiker at the end of a 19 mile day, that is priceless!  But backing up to this morning, we woke up early in the Hurricane Mountain Shelter to a beautiful sunrise that looked like a sky full of fire. We packed up and were hiking by 7:30. We knew we were doing a lot of miles but were pleased with the generally fair grade. Large sections of the trail were again quite rocky which continues to take a toll on our feet.   We passed another waterfall right on trail this morning. It was awesome as the water cascaded above and below the trail. We stopped in to the Trimpi Shelter to get water and have a snack. It is a really neat stone shelter with a fireplace. It is in a beautiful setting. The weather was great for about the first 15 miles of the day. We then had enough of a shower to break out the rain jackets for an hour or so. Before we reached the  shelter we were able to stow away the jackets again.  Just after our pizzas were delivered, the torrential rains hit. We sat on the visitor center porch and ate our large supreme pizzas and drank our 2 liter Pepsi’s until a break in the weather and then made our way back to the shelter. We had a couple of slices to share with later arriving hikers and a bit of Pepsi left for breakfast. A second interesting fact about the Partnership Shelter is that on the FarOut app this is the only shelter so far that comes with a big red warning triangle. The warning is that alcohol is prohibited. Oddly enough, this may be the only shelter so far that I’ve actually seen people with alcohol. Not only did one section hiker have a bottle of “trail juice”, a person hiked down the trail from the visitor center and brought beer to everyone that wanted one. He even brought one to TheOkie after TheOkie politely declined. After declining again, another hiker eagerly took it off his hands.  Tonight we are sharing the shelter with Papa Smurf, Caboose, Otis the Potus and his human Boxer Mom, Superior, Dave & Dave and Math.  Today’s miles moved the needle to 24%, so another big milestone is coming up soon.","Hurricane Mountain Shelter

Several nights recently I had gotten too warm during the night all zipped up in the bag. So this may be my new sleeping style. After downing the last of the 2 liter Pepsi and my final cliff bar for breakfast, we walked back down to the visitor center. Once they opened, we went in and looked around at the exhibits for a few minutes and then got started on the trail. The first half of the day was certainly a continuation of the rock strewn path of the last few days. However about mid-hike we entered the green tunnel of rhododendrons and the treadway was great by comparison. Later we walked through pine needle covered paths which was also awesome. Toward the end of our hike, we came across an 1890’s farmstead that is part of the settler’s museum. We dropped our packs in the lush grass and wandered around the grounds looking at the different buildings. Just up the trail, we stopped in to see the Lindamood Schoolhouse, a furnished one-room schoolhouse complete with desks, a blackboard , and wood stove in the center of the room. They also had a hiker box with Trail magic and first aid supplies for hikers in the back of the classroom.Close to town, we crossed a set of railroad tracks. On the other side of the tracks, there was a nice boardwalk that we hiked on across a long swampy area. This boardwalk wasn’t as long as the ones we will hike in New Jersey, but we were very appreciative of it. Eventually we made our way to a Sunoco station where the trail crosses the road. We posted up in their snack bar area while we ate our fill of the finest foods the convenience store had to offer: Chicken Salad Sandwich, Crunchy Cheetos, Dr. Enuf, Corn Nuts, Peanut M&M’s, and a Coke. A quick, 3,000 calorie lunch. Several other hikers stopped in to take advantage of the food offerings also. Our real motive for posting up in the convenience store was waiting for my wife and TheOkie’s wife to arrive and take us away.  It was so great to see my wife after the longest we have been apart in over 37 years!  She was also the best trail angel ever as she brought me new shoes, clothes to swap out, resupply items, and a ton of other items I needed. Also, she and TheOkie’s wife brought items to set up at a trail crossing and do trail magic for other hikers in the area. How great is that!  I would also like to thank Marsha, a long time friend who sent a large bag of great cookies she made. If I can find the self control, I will share them with the other hikers.  I spent tonight with a nice dinner for us three hikers and two wives and then spent some time to organize my resupply items. Tomorrow the wives will drop us off to slack pack and then go do some trail magic. I can’t stress enough how great it is to have my favorite trail angel by my side for a few days!","Partnership Shelter

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662325,"“The point of goals isn’t to achieve them. The point is who you become on the way to them.” -Henry David ThoreauThis morning we woke up in the hotel and went to have breakfast. They had the fancy automated pancake machine, so I started the day with 4 pancakes. Then being in the south, I had a bowl of grits to top things off. We loaded up with our very light packs carrying snacks, water bottles and filters, and a few clothing options. My favorite trail angel then drove us back to the Sunoco station, where we left the trail yesterday, for a day of slack packing. Just before we reached the station, we saw Papa Smurf doing the short road walk section, so we pulled over to him. I rolled down my window and told him that we would have some trail magic for him later today since our trail angels had driven all the way from Oklahoma yesterday to take care of hikers. Once we were dropped off, we started hiking in the cool wind. Knowing that it was supposed to warm up later, I started off in shorts with my rain pants over them. After climbing straight up a few hills, it was time to put the rain pants and light jacket in the backpack. By this time we had caught up to Papa Smurf and visited with him again. Within the first 4 miles of the hike, we hit a very exciting milestone. We passed the quarter way tree!  We are officially 1/4 of the way to Mt. Katahdin!  There is a sign nailed to a tree to commemorate this occasion. Since the actual trail mileage changes slightly each year due to reroutes, the running joke is, do they move that tree each year?  Whether it is in the exact spot or not, we were pretty excited to meet that milestone and see our needle jump up to a significant 25%!  We traveled pretty fast with the light packs and didn’t stop for snacks very often. With the cooler weather, we never had to stop for additional water today. A few miles from the end we were hiking through a giant green meadow of rolling hills. A southbound hiker met us and excitedly told us that our wives were the greatest people ever. The hiker was Torch and she had met our favorite trail angels and spent 30 minutes talking to them. That made us feel really good. I mean we know that they’re great, but now we are getting that fact confirmed by the thru hiking community. We hurried through the rest of our hike stopping a few times to take pictures of the abundant beautiful wildflowers, the awe inspiring mountainous landscape, and a few interesting old buildings. When we reached our final road crossing, we were met by our favorite trail angels. They even offered us snacks, drinks, and homemade goodies. We took them up on all of the above as they told us who all they had been able to serve Trail Magic to. We were very excited that several people from our bubble had popped out at that crossing at just the right time to meet them. They had met Superior, Dave & Dave, Clueless, Elf, & Little Prince, Math, Bubbles & Lucky Charms, Seeker, Rabbit, and our fire starter friends from the partnership shelter among others.   Our trail angels were very excited about how well their time had gone, and I KNOW that all of the hikers were blessed to cross paths with them today. Papa Smurf hadn’t made it to the crossing by the time we left, so we bagged up some of all the goodies, put his name on it, and left it at a place he couldn’t miss.  Then we drove the short distance down to the Bear Garden Hiker Hostel where the owners had invited the ladies down to check out the hostel. The owners were super friendly and a wealth of information. On the drive back to the hotel, we stopped by the Big Walker Lookout and Country Store where TheOkie treated us all to the most important meal of the day, ice cream!  Back at the hotel, we all got cleaned up and then headed out to the 1776 Log House restaurant. We had a great dinner in a very unique old building. It is time to get to sleep now. Tomorrow I have to take care of some business and then we are going back to the Grayson Highlands so our trail angels can see the ponies for themselves.","US Route 11

My breakfast fare was the same as yesterday, but some guest caused the fancy pancake conveyor belt to malfunction resulting in a plate with a stack of over 40 pancakes piled high. Honestly sounds like a thru hiker dream. Today I had some business to attend to on a zoom call, so we took a zero day and returned to the Grayson Highlands so our favorite Trail angels could see the ponies. The drive over there was about an hour with most of that spent winding through the curves going up and through the mountains. Once there, my wife and I as well as TheOkie and his wife made the short hike from the parking area up to the area the ponies roam. We met a family that was leaving and they told us where they had located the ponies. We went that direction and immediately found 9 ponies. They are quite used to interacting with people and immediately walked our direction. We were able to get some great pictures of them and they were content to stay around as long as we wanted. When we left, we encountered a few thru hikers where the AT intersects the trail we were on. We stopped and visited with Tire Kicker and  later met Sugar the malamute and her human, Mama Bear. When we returned to Wytheville, we got JFK and all went to a local restaurant. Then we worked out our plans for the next few days so we would know what we needed for a resupply. After buying more than we needed at the grocery store, we headed back toward the hotel. However we did have to take a huge detour to the Dairy Queen for the most important meal of the day, ice cream.  Then it was time to organize all of the food and get ready for about 18 miles of slack packing tomorrow while our favorite trail angels spend the day doing trail magic again. Even though the miles we walked today didn’t count as AT miles, it was a great day. Beautiful weather in a beautiful place watching the beautiful horses with my beautiful wife.","VA Route 42

– Aesop 
Breakfast at the hotel wasn’t quite as exciting today since there was no plate accumulating 40 pancakes to watch. We got an early start so our wives could deliver us to the trail for a pretty long slack pack while they did trail magic again. 
Yesterday we were looking for a place of a reasonable distance that we could hike to and the ladies could pick us up. The next two linear days take us by Burke’s Garden. It is a huge valley that is essentially an ancient limestone sinkhole. I’ve seen it called the thumbprint of God. The trail near there is also VERY remote and difficult to access by car. We called a hostel owner in the area and asked if they would shuttle us from the mountain road crossing we needed to get picked up at and deliver us back there the next day. They said that they wouldn’t drive up that narrow, winding forest road, even for money. Well that answered any question we had about our wives driving up there to shuttle us!  
So, JFK suggested that today, the ladies slack us on a section past that inaccessible area that had suitable distance and reasonable access. Then tomorrow they can drop us at the point we hiked to on Tuesday which is before the beginning of the inaccessible area. Then they can begin their drive back to Oklahoma. It is a little complicated and will require a shuttle on Sunday to jump past the 18.4 mile section we hiked today, but it was the best and safest scenario considering all of our objectives. 
But today’s hike was great. We again had beautiful sunny skies.  I tried out the sun-hoodie shirt that my wife brought for me. I will be keeping it for a while and sending the heavier fleece hoodie back with her. 
The first 80% of the trail today had a great treadway. It wasn’t until late in the day that it became a bit rocky. We walked up on a deer and a lizard in the rocky section. Earlier in the day, we saw some spectacular blossoms on the trees.  I don’t know what kind they were, but their pink color really stood out. We have noticed just within the last couple of days how much more the trees are leafing out. I don’t know if it is due to location, warmer weather, lower elevations, or just the calendar, but it is really noticeable. 
At one point today, we hiked up on an ice chest that had contained drinks, and a box that still had bags of chips in it. We each gratefully took a bag of chips from the unknown trail angels to eat with our lunch. About 12 miles into the hike, we stopped at Jenny Knob shelter to collect water and eat our snacks for lunch. 
Borat was there when we arrived. He is a young man from Philadelphia who is in the Marine reserves and has to leave the trail for a few days each month to go to drills.  
At the end of our long hike, we came across a long, swinging suspension bridge over Kimberling Creek. Just as we crossed the bridge, we saw our wives arrive to pick us up. Today’s miles pushed the needle up to 26%.
Our favorite trail angels saw more hikers than we did today. We were very excited to hear that they met Bambi, Miller Time, Trail Bob, and Brightside because we have spent a lot of time hiking around them and visiting with them. They made the day of several other appreciative hikers as well. Even though a Gatorade and some homemade cookies might not seem like a lot, to a hot, tired, hungry thru hiker, it can really be the bright spot of your day. I know the recipients of the trail Magic appreciate our favorite trail angels, just like we do. 
Once we arrived back in Wytheville, we went directly to Moon Dog Brick Oven Pizza. It was really good food and filling. It is so nice to have town food for a few days before we return to spam or tuna packets on tortillas. 
We hate to see our wives head back home in the morning, but we know they will be back to visit before long. We appreciate all of the support they have given us and are proud of them for spending their time doing trail magic for others as well.","Brushy Mountain Outpost

This was our last morning at our hotel in Wytheville. We were up early again because our wives had a very long drive home after they dropped us off. They delivered us to the trailhead which we hiked to on Tuesday. While there, they took all of the trail magic food and drinks that they had not given out, and hiked them in to an empty trail magic ice chest they had seen a short distance up the trail. After a sad goodbye, we hiked up the hill and into the woods. I can’t express how much I appreciate them making the long trip out here to support us on our hike. We ran into 5 hikers today that had received Trail magic from them and they all wanted us to be sure and thank them again for their kindness. 
Today’s hike had another warning triangle on it for a bridge that had been washed away a few years ago. Since the bridge hasn’t been replaced, this is the first place we have had to ford a stream. Although the water wasn’t very deep, there was no way to just rock-hop over it. So we stopped and put on our water shoes and forded the shallow stream. The cold water felt really good on the feet. Once on the other side, we dried our feet, put on our dry socks snd shoes, filtered some water and had a snack. 
Then it was back on the trail. There was over a mile of climbing again today. The treadway was very nice early on, in fact we had a grass path through a meadow for a few miles at one point.  
Water grew more scarce through the day. We stopped below the top of the mountain and the piped spring was barely dripping. We used JFK’s cup to scoop water from a puddle. Once filtered, it was fine. 
When we reached the chestnut knob shelter at the top of the ridge, you could finally see over into Burke’s Garden. It is an 8 mile by 4 mile sinkhole that is now a valley completely surrounded by mountains.  Before it sunk, it was the top of the one big mountain. There are lots of lush green farms in the valley. The trail follows the mountain above the valley for 8 miles. Eight incredibly rocky miles. 
After 17.5 miles, we called the Burke’s Garden Hostel and they came and picked us up. We got their last 2 beds and a couch for the night. Since it should be raining in the morning, we are glad for a dry place to stay. At the hostel, we encountered 2 more hikers that had received trail magic from our wives they also sang their praises and really loved the home made cookies. Today’s miles moved our needle to the 27% mark and set us up for another big milestone tomorrow!","VA Route 42

The predicted rain storm hit with a fury just after 5 am. I was under my sleeping bag, in a bed, on the upper floor of a nicely remodeled Amish barn that has been converted to a hostel. With the thunder, lightning, and heavy pounding rain, I was glad to be there. The rain was pelting the roof like a fire hose and I could hear it through the earplugs I had deployed earlier in the night due to the snorers in the room. The rain was blowing in through the windows that had been left up a bit for a cool ventilating breeze, but Fairy Trails jumped into action shutting all the windows before our sleeping bags got wet.

At 8 am, I went downstairs, still wearing my loaner clothes of an XL sleeveless T-shirt and baggy shorts, for the waffle breakfast. I’m sure I was a sight and need to spend a bit more time selecting my loaner clothes instead of just grabbing off the top of the stack. 
After the rains quit around 10, we were shuttled back up the mountain to where the trail crosses 623.   The trail started off with the same rock shenanigans that we finished with yesterday. Soon the trail turned much nicer both in grade and treadway. For large parts of the day we actually hiked on an old forest roadbed. 
Around 5 miles into the hike we spotted our first red eft. These tiny creatures were one of the things I have been looking forward to seeing on the trail. For the next few miles we saw 7 of them coming out after the morning’s rain. 
The weather was very nice for hiking. The temperatures were in the 50’s and it never rained on us although when we started out we were hiking in a cloud. 
When we reached the Brushy Mountain Outpost, Robert came and shuttled us to the Weary Feet Hostel. I can’t think of a more appropriate name. When we arrived, Julie the owner handed us plates piled high with spaghetti. She later refilled the plate. We also had a large salad and homemade cake for dessert. 
Today our total mileage passed the 600 mile mark. Virginia may keep us from marking off other states for a while, but it will provide us several opportunities to cross hundred-mile marks.  We are still looking for the flat spot of the trail.","VA Route 623

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662593,"“Laugh and the world laughs with you, snore and you sleep alone.” — Anthony Burgess, Inside Mr. EnderbyWe had a dismal night’s sleep in the Weary Feet bunkhouse. The hostel served great food and the owners were super nice, but the bunkhouse was, let’s say, lacking. That was ok, because we were warm and dry. But the LOUDEST snorer ever was on the bunk under TheOkie and across from me. We had earplugs in, but it didn’t matter. It was so bad that Possum actually grabbed all of his stuff and headed outside to sleep after paying for a night inside the bunkhouse. Now we all expect snorers in a bunkhouse. At times, all 3 of us snore, one pretty consistently, but this was epic snoring cranked up to 11. This morning, JFK said he was a bit cranky after only getting about 3 hours of sleep. Before heading out, TheOkie casually asked the snorer how far he was headed today. We were quite relieved when he said he was pushing on further than what we planned. Robert from the hostel offered to shuttle us back to our starting point today. It was only 0.3 miles, but we immediately said YES!  Funny that we would walk over 600 miles, but if 0.3 miles “doesn’t count”, we don’t want to walk it. The hike started out nice and early on we chose to take the side trail down to Dismal Falls. It was 0.3 miles downhill and then obviously 0.3 back uphill to the trail. As mentioned before, we hate walking miles that don’t count, but we have made a point of doing it anyway if it means getting a great view or seeing something interesting. Dismal Falls were quite the opposite of dismal. They were pretty large and wide with a good drop that the water careened down. It was actually a lovely setting, up in the mountains. I’m not sure who was in charge of marketing in the Bland, Virginia area back in the day, but I think they could have come up with more appealing names than Bland and Dismal. Later in the day we hiked past a pretty pond next to the trail just before we pulled in to the Wapiti Shelter for snacks and to get water. The day ended up taking us through a few miles of rocks. The cumulative effect of this day after day, has all of our feet quite sore at the end of the day. When we finally reached the turnoff to the Wood’s Hole Hostel, we walked down the 0.3 mile gravel road to the property. We were met by the friendly staff who showed us where the bunkhouse is for tonight. They also mentioned when dinner was and that you could order fresh made bread to hike out with in the morning. Yes, please!  I asked if they happened to have any of those loaves left from this morning, and they did. For $4 I devoured a loaf of bread walking down to the bunkhouse. Once we entered the bunkhouse, we went upstairs and selected our bunk. We were unloading our packs and getting things ready for the evening when guess who walked in. THE SUPER SNORER!  The universe has quite the sense of humor. After showering, JFK quickly switched bunks to one farther away from the human chainsaw.  On a bright note, at lunch today we had cell signal and called ahead and reserved space at a hostel we will hike to tomorrow. They had 3 private rooms still available, so no bunk room for us regardless of who shows up. Dinner tonight was a special treat. They serve vegetarian meals and use many ingredients that they grow themselves. We had pumpkin lasagna, black eyed peas, salad that was growing earlier today, fresh baked bread, and a great cookie for dessert. After dinner we sat around visiting and the hostel owner gave us the history of the property. The main log cabin that we were sitting in was built in the 1880’s. It has been remodeled and added on to through the years, but it is a really special place. For our metric friends, today we passed the 1,000 KM mark. The numbers were written out in rocks, which certainly weren’t hard to find. For our friends watching the imaginary needle move, it jumped up to 28% today!  Here’s hoping that tonight’s sleep is peaceful and not dismal!","Kimberling Creek VA 606

We slept in a bit later than usual since breakfast was not served until 8:00. It was definitely worth the wait! We had a frittata, peach crisp, oatmeal with multiple toppings, fresh baked bread with home made apple butter and strawberry jam, and orange juice. I was so stuffed from breakfast that I couldn’t finish the additional loaf of fresh baked bread by the time we hiked back up the hill to rejoin the trail. Don’t worry though, I have since finished the loaf. It was delicious!  I think starting each day with a fresh baked loaf of bread should become an AT tradition. I mean if you’re going to be walking, you might as well be walking and eating a loaf of bread, am I right?!?! Today was a fairly short walk into Pearisburg, Virginia. The weather was cool starting out, in fact it got below freezing last night, but warmed up to a great hiking temperature with beautiful blue skies. We stopped at several view spots along the way and had endless views. Everything has greened up so much in just the last few days that you can’t really see views through the forest like you could when we initially started. At our first view spot we were met with a few curious deer when we got down off of the view ledge. Three really nice  section hikers from Florida, Slow Train, Siri, and 5 Star who we met at the hostel dinner last night, arrived just as we were leaving the view spot. They were also able to see the deer there. As we hiked a bit farther down the trail, we encountered a couple more deer. One was actually standing on the trail and trimming the tender green vegetation that has begun to encroach on the trail. We thanked them for their service. We hiked on a lot of large rocks and slabs today which were easier on the feet than the chunks of rocks we have been hiking on. Today also had so many wildflowers everywhere you looked that it slowed us down taking pictures. When we got into town, we called the Angels Rest Hiker Haven and they sent a shuttle to pick us up. Once we arrived they showed us to our private rooms. We have showered and done laundry. We have worked out the logistics for the next section of trail, so we know what we need to buy for resupply. We walked to the Mexican restaurant for supper. We saw lots of other hikers there as well. I had the chicken fajitas for 1. It was definitely for 1 thru hiker or a family of 4. I ate and ate and it looked like I hadn’t started on the mound of chicken. I thought TheOkie & JFK were going to give up on me before I finished it. After supper we walked to the grocery store and bought our food for the next 4 days then walked back to the hostel. Looks like we will slack pack about 20 miles tomorrow and return here for another night. That will extend our streak of showers to 9 consecutive days. We’re hardly feral anymore at this point.

The 3 of us as well as the 3 section hikers from Florida were headed to the Peter’s Mountain Trailhead 20 trail miles ahead in order to hike back to Angel’s Rest. Mountain Mike, the shuttle driver was ready to go at 7 and quickly got us to our destination. TheOkie led all of us in a prayer and then we headed out. We started the morning with a big climb, but it was a great grade with switchbacks and the treadway was very nice. Although it was freezing at the start, we quickly warmed up and peeled our outer layer. When we made it to the top of the mountain, we were on the lookout for a herd of feral goats that live there. I’ve seen videos of them trying to eat hiker’s gear and following hikers around to try and get the salt off of them and their equipment. We never saw the goats, but they had eaten all of the vegetation off of that part of the mountain. There was nothing on the ground but rocks. If only they could find goats that eat rocks!We stopped for a midday snack in a beautiful mountain top meadow that had views that went on forever. The whole day had been an incredible show of wildflowers and beautiful skies. While stopped, JFK pulled up the latest Ramdino Thru Hiker Update on YouTube to check on the norovirus outbreak. It seems that it is pretty far south of us, but it spreads and we definitely don’t want it!  As we continued on, we came to the end of the 10 mile section that doesn’t have any water sources. We stopped and collected water from a very strong spring. We hiked on and stopped in to the Rice Field Shelter for another snack. Just up from the shelter, a hiker had his tent set up on the edge of the ridge. He definitely has unlimited views and I hope he catches an awesome sunset up there. As we were getting back toward town, it seemed like we could see it but couldn’t get to it. We were routed to a very nice pedestrian lane next to a busy highway bridge over the New River. Eventually we turned back in the woods and made it to the parking lot that we had ended at yesterday. Within minutes Mountain Mike was there to pick us up and return us to Angel’s Rest. I got settled in the bunkhouse while TheOkie & JFK set up their tents. Then it was a walk up the hill to Dairy Queen for a double cheeseburger basket and a banana split. Then to the convenience store next door for Corn Nuts.  Then to Food Lion for some peanut butter pretzels. Finally we made it back and showered. The 3 Florida hikers made it in after a very hard, long hike especially for section hikers who haven’t had the benefit of 7 solid weeks of trail preparation like the thru hikers have. We counted hikers that we met on trail today and we saw a total  of 31 hikers. We knew 11 of them: Alabama Army Guy, Trash Can, Woodsman, Starman, K-Dog, Grit, Good Soup, Girl Scout, Possum, Oz, and Peep.   Before bedtime, TheOkie and I placed a FaceTime call to our friends at our former workplace. They were having their annual employee appreciation dinner and were kind enough to show us the delicious steaks they had grilled.  Boy did they look GOOD!  Today’s miles moved the needle to 29%.    We have another big mile day planned tomorrow.

This morning when my alarm went off at 6, I was in a deep sleep and had to scramble to shut it off so I wouldn’t disturb the other hikers in the bunk room. I had organized things as much as I could last night which made getting ready in the dark easier. Since I was slack packing just over 20 miles again today, it was important to take the fewest items that I knew I would need. My other items were placed in trash bags and stored in the office until I returned. I have a nylafume bag which is a pack liner used as an extra line of defense against rain getting in the pack. Fun fact, Nylafume is the crinkliest substance mankind has ever developed. Ask any hiker and they’ll back me up on that. Regardless of how quiet I was getting ready in the dark to keep from disturbing the sleeping hikers, once I started messing with the Nylafume bag, I could have stirred the dead. I apologize to anyone in the Angel’s Rest bunkhouse from this morning. 
Mountain Mike was right on time and we loaded up for the long drive to our starting point 20 trail miles away.
When we hiked off, we only made it 0.1 mile from the parking lot to the actual trail before we were laughing to the point of tears. Well, some of us were. Soon we made it to an area that looked and smelled like it had very recently burned. It was odd that it was only burned on one side of the trail, so maybe it was a controlled burn.  
Seven miles in, we came up on a side trail to a view and decided to take it.  It was an incredible open view from rock ledges looking off in the distance. We took several photos and videos panning across the horizon. As we were walking away, I got out my phone to look at the FarOut app to see the name of the view spot.  Once I saw that it was Wind Rock, I started to walk off. The only problem was that I was still looking at my phone screen and didn’t see that the next step was way below where I was standing. I landed hard on my left foot and stumbled awkwardly with my trekking poles tucked up under my arm. I rode it out and stayed upright, but that could have been a trip ruiner. That, boys and girls is why you don’t text and drive or check FarOut while walking on rocks. 
A few more miles down the trail, we came to a point where the AT intersected another trail and there was a traffic jam. Seven staff and volunteers from the ATC were out looking at areas of the trail that need re-routed to improve them. It is unusual to run into anyone at a trail intersection so we stopped for quite a while to visit with the friendly folks. 
Twelve miles into our hike, we stopped into the War Spur Shelter for a lunch snack and to collect water. When we arrived, Grit was there finishing his lunch. He was the first of only 2 thru hikers we encountered today. 
It was another beautiful day for hiking. The weather was a little warmer, but still great. We were again treated to magnificent blooming flowers and trees throughout the day. I think that has been one of the most surprising positive things about the trail and definitely one of my favorites. The hike itself was characterized by BIG ups, very rocky sections, a few mile stretch of great levelish trail, more BIG ups, and big downs. A lot of variety, some good, some challenging. 
The final mile was through a big meadow, down to a creek, and a marshy area. There was a long section at the very end that contained sections of 2 parallel boards to walk on above the marsh. I couldn’t decide if this was a thru hiker agility course or a thru hiker sobriety test. Either way, we all passed the test and made it to Mountain Mikes vehicle where he was waiting with Gatorade for each of us. 
On the 30 minute ride back to town, Mountain Mike’s car had an “electrical problem” that prevented my window from rolling up. This was not Mountain Mike’s first time to shuttle 3 smelly hikers and I salute his ingenuity in not being trapped in a car with our odor for 30 minutes!  He was kind enough to let us collect our belongings and shuttled us over to the Plaza motel for the night after we paid out at Angel’s Rest. 
We quickly walked over to the Mexican restaurant across the street where  Wednesday night is fajita night. Then on the way back to the motel, we detoured across the street the other direction and found ourselves back at the Dairy Queen for the most important meal of the day. After seeing TheOkie’s choco dipped strawberry Blizzard yesterday, I thought I better try one. I did and it was excellent. 
Then it was back to the motel for showers and to get organized for the next few days. Today’s miles moved our needle to another significant milestone. We have now completed 30% of the trail!  If you are one of the people I gave a 4 foot tall map of the AT to follow along, you probably don’t have to get down on your hands and knees anymore to see where we are.  In the last week, we have hiked 119.2 miles.  No wonder the needle is moving and our feet are tired!","Peter’s Mountain Trailhead

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662812,"“Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get.” - Forrest GumpThis morning, TheOkie and I walked down to Hardee’s and had a couple of sausage and egg biscuits to end our streak of town food. Since walking into Pearisburg 4 days ago, we have had access to showers, laundry, beds, and town food. That makes it hard to leave. At 9:15, Mountain Mike was at the Plaza Motel to return us to the trail for the last time. He had been a man of few words the previous few days, but was almost chatty today. It turns out that he had thru hiked the AT in 1988 and had also done the Pacific Crest Trail. Just over a mile into the day we walked past the Keffer oak. This is the largest tree in the southern half of the trail and is estimated to be over 300 years old. As a woodturner, I couldn’t help but think how many bowls that would make. Once we climbed the initial 1,000 feet up to the ridge the views were incredible. The ridges opposite us were unlike any we have seen previously as they were deeply furrowed. Along the top, we saw the Bruiser’s Knob Cairns. These large impressive stone towers were built by early farmers and have really stood the test of time.  With care, they should stand as eternal monuments along the safety of the Appalachian Trail. Also on the ridge line today, we came across a sign indicating we were at the Eastern Continental Divide. Any liquids hitting the ground on the west side of the sign flow into the Gulf of Mexico and any liquids hitting the ground on the east side of the sign flow into the Atlantic Ocean. I’m not sure what happens to liquids that actually hit the tree that the sign is attached to. We stopped at the Niday shelter to have an afternoon snack and collect water. We discussed the pros and cons of staying in the shelter where we will be dry for tonights rain versus hiking past the creek that we will need to ford tomorrow in case the rain swells it. We decided on the comfort of the dry shelter. As we walked down to the water source, I saw my first orange azaleas. We have seen beautiful pink and white ones, but these were striking as well. As I was sitting down to have my spam and goldfish ( the cracker, not the animal) tortillas, Maps came into camp. He decided to stay in the shelter as well. Soon after that, Girl Scout arrived in camp and decided to stay in the shelter. We had lots of good conversation with the two younger hikers. Just after the rains hit, Oz arrived and filled the final spot in the shelter. Now we are all settled in for a cool night’s sleep as the raindrops are coming down on the metal roof of the shelter and the universe is grinning.","VA Route 42

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662886,"""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth."" - Mike Tyson We had a great night’s sleep with the pitter patter of rain on the shelter roof all night long.  When we woke up, we saw a river of water streaming under the shelter. The forecast of heavy rain had come true. Girl Scout was the first one from the shelter that was ready to hit the trail. She decided to wait on us so we could try and make an intelligent group decision about fording the stream or taking the ATC walk-around. We were all hoping to ford the stream where the damaged bridge had been removed earlier this week, but as we walked the flooded trail and crossed the swollen streams that crossed the trail, we weren’t optimistic. Once we arrived at Craig Creek, we couldn’t even tell where the creek was supposed to be. It was out of its banks and the brown water was churning and moving swiftly. It didn’t take us long to decide to adhere to the policy of “turn around, don’t drown”.  The ATC had posted directions for the walk around and had made it the “official route” for thru hike purposes. So we started up the road on a 4.5 mile road walk. On a positive note, it was the flattest and easiest section of trail we have walked since starting in Georgia.  Lots of rain had initially been predicted for today, but by the time we finished breakfast and left the shelter, it never rained on us all day. The day held so many special sights and moments. The big rain once again brought out the red efts. I found over 10 of the orange polka dotted little creatures. The odd thing is that I was again hiking in the back and neither JFK or TheOkie spotted one until I pointed it out. One was actually in the middle of the trail and was missed by inches when a large hiking shoe walked right over him. We’re not sure why I can spot them or why they can’t. There were also an unimaginable number of beautiful flowers on today’s hike. So many of the rhododendrons or azaleas were blooming that it seemed like you were surrounded by them all day long. We also saw our first, and quite a few, pink lady slipper flowers today. The Lily of the Valley flowers also started blooming in the area we hiked today. So much color and beauty everywhere you looked made for an enjoyable hike.  We also took the short side trail to the Dragon’s Tooth. This is a 35 foot tall rock spire that juts up into the sky and provides great views and an epic photo op. I was glad that the rock was dry when we arrived because it actually takes a bit of real climbing to get onto the rock that ends in the spire and it takes a bit of nerve to climb to the narrow top of the rock. It is an iconic part of the AT and a part of “The Virginia Triple Crown”. I was also glad that I had someone there to capture a picture of the moment for me. Maps had been partway up the tooth when I arrived, so as I climbed past him I gave him my phone and he graciously took a few pictures for me. By the time I was nearing the spire, JFK & TheOkie had made it down the side trail and they both captured the moment for me as well. The rest of the trail down the huge mountain was quite challenging also.  The white blazes painted on the rocks led you down a long series of narrow ledges and slanted rocks. Many places you had to hold onto the rock with your hands and slide your feet down until they made contact with a narrow foothold below. All while wearing a 30 pound backpack!  We eventually made it down to the bottom of the mountain, but today really took a toll on TheOkie. He had been nursing a hurt shin the last couple of days and we thought it was improving. But the cumulative impact of the high miles we have been hiking along with the steep and rocky terrain had him gutting it out. He really had to cowboy up just to get to the bottom today. We decided that we would catch a shuttle into nearby Salem, Virginia and take a few zeros to let his leg heal up and give everyone some much needed rest. It’s definitely not a race and the number one goal is for all of us to finish. Mountain Mike had told us if we needed any help in this area to call a shuttle driver named Sprocket.  We made that call and within a few minutes we were headed for the La Quinta in Salem, driven by Sprocket and his 2 dogs. After checking in and showering, we took an Uber to go eat. And eat, we did. I had garlic bread knots, a salad, steak, baked potato, and a giant brownie with ice cream, whipped cream, and hot fudge on it. A few more calories than the spam and chicken tortillas last night. Today on the trail we passed the 700 mile mark. Maps happened to walk by just as we were taking pictures and he took one of all 3 of us. Our mileage budged our imaginary needle up to 32% of the trail completed. Today marks 2 months on the trail for JFK and me. The day itself was full of adventure, beauty, laughter, challenges, and fun. While it didn’t end quite the way we planned, we think this is another good decision that will benefit us in the long run. And a 2,198.4 mile journey is definitely a long run.","Niday Shelter

We had the hotel breakfast, did our laundry, bought our resupply food, and had lunch.  This evening we finally went out and had dinner at Chick-Fil-A and a big DQ Blizzard for dessert. In between, TheOkie iced his shin and rolled it out. JFK rented a car so we didn’t have to walk everywhere, which would be impractical in this larger, spread out town. There is a website that will predict when you will arrive at certain spots on the trail based on your pace up to that point. Based on what we have done so far, our estimated finish date is considerably ahead of what we had originally planned on. Now we do have a few multi-zero family visits planned, so that will affect those dates in the future, but spending time to heal up and rest up doesn’t put anything in jeopardy.  We also have a few visits from friends and family coming up in the next couple of months. In addition to the boost we will get from just seeing them, there will also be some slack packing opportunities which will allow us to knock out some bigger miles with lighter packs.  So when the time is right, we will head back out on trail. We are planning a few shorter days to start with and make sure everyone is as healthy as possible because we are all in it for the long run!  Since I didn’t take any pictures today, I will add some photos of one of my favorite parts of the trail, the wildflowers. These are just a few of the different ones spotted this month. I’ll plan on sharing more tomorrow.  See how many you can identify.

Never do anything else.” -Martha Beck I had a great night’s sleep and woke up after 8. That NEVER happens in the shelters or in the tent. We soon went down for the hotel breakfast of waffles and bagels. After a shower, we went to the Westside Church of Christ. The first person that greeted us and found out we were thru hikers said we had to meet Coach. They called Coach over and  we couldn’t have been more welcomed. Coach is a retired gym teacher and associate pastor who has section hiked the entire southern half of the AT. He is planning his next section in Pennsylvania next month. He invited us to lunch after church. After the service, the pastor, who also likes hiking, visited with us. Then Coach took us to Wendy’s where he treated us to trail magic of lunch. We had a great visit as each of us loves talking about all things AT.  We truly had a great time. We continue to be humbled by the kindness of strangers along the trail. After a relaxing day, we sought out the Texas Roadhouse restaurant where I had a great meal of town food consisting of a steak, baked sweet potato, salad, and a few rolls. Well actually a lot of rolls. TheOkie has arranged for our shuttle back to the trail tomorrow after we return the rental car that JFK arranged. Our plan is to hike 3 short days into Daleville and see how TheOkie’s shin does. Since this is the last day of the month, I’ll give some statistics. In March, we hiked 307 miles and in April we hiked 396 miles. My phone’s step counter says that I have taken a total of 1,756,964 steps since the day we started the trail.

This was our final morning for the bagel and waffle breakfast at the hotel. I took one last shower and packed my backpack. By 9:30 we were headed to return the rental car. By 10:00 we were strapped into Sprocket’s car taking the very spirited shuttle back to the trail. 
Thankful to arrive at the trailhead, we quickly grabbed our gear and started hiking. I was immediately struck by two thoughts. First, as relaxing as the last two days were, it just seemed right to be walking. Second, it looked like we were viewing everything through green tinted lenses. Everything above us and below has leafed out so much in the last few days, the sun shining through the canopy gave everything a green hue.  
We took it slow and easy today. We were only hiking 8 miles, so we didn’t have to hurry. We stopped at a couple of view spots along the way. With everything leafed out, views are much harder to come by than they were last month. Even the designated view spots will often be partially obstructed with leafed out trees.  
There was a lot of green leaf litter in the trail that looked like strong winds had blown through the area. Oddly, we saw many, many oak leaf galls on the ground today. We also saw far fewer wildflowers in this section. 
The trail crosses a fairly busy highway that we had been shuttled up earlier in the day. Before we crossed, we definitely looked both ways and listened for an engine roar to make sure Sprocket wasn’t barreling through. We safely passed to the other side of the highway and back into the woods. 
We stopped in to the first shelter we passed and had a snack and checked the shelter logbook. Then it was on to the Catawba Mountain Shelter where we will spend tonight. We gathered water from the fast flowing stream and then sat at the new picnic table to have dinner.  It was about 4:30. 
Three section hikers from Mississippi joined us for dinner and we swapped stories. Then thru hikers K, who is tenting here, and Mad Dog, who already had his stuff set up in the shelter, joined us. By 5:30, I had brushed my teeth and put my bear bag inside the bear box for the night. 
It has been kind of a cool and breezy day and I am about ready to climb in my nice warm sleeping bag. TheOkie led the way today and his shin did ok. I know he wishes it would heal quickly, but we are content to continue moving forward slowly for now.  It was another great day on the AT.","VA Route 624

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663124,"“But did you die?” -Mr. Chow Last night was a good night to be in the shelter. A rain storm blew in with strong gusty winds, keeping the night chilly. After the storm blew past, the sky cleared and a very bright moon shined into the shelter. Mad Dog got up around 5 and packed up quietly in his attempt to catch the sunrise on McAfee Knob. We were only hiking 8 miles today, so we were on a different plan. Much past the rising of the sun, we got up, had breakfast, and packed up.  Today was a big day as we completed the Virginia Triple Crown. The trail up to McAfee Knob was nice and wide and although we climbed about 1,000 feet from the shelter, it was at a nice gradual grade.  They claim that the McAfee Knob is the most photographed spot on the AT. I personally had been waiting about 10 years for my chance to get my photo taken on the iconic overhang with the valley floor below and miles of mountains fading away in the background. Once the knob came into view, it was a bit surreal to actually be standing there. Not knowing if we will ever be here again, we took our time and got photos with packs, without packs, standing, sitting along the edge, individual, and group. Surely with that many options, we will find what we were looking for. For the group shots, we traded photographer services with section hikers we had previously met at the shelter. The Florida couple, Trouble and Deliberate were by first and then the 3 gentlemen from Mississippi made it up to the knob. It was a beautiful day, but very gusty winds as evidenced by TheOkie’s hat deciding to fly off his head and fly away to freedom, between the snapping of a couple of photos.  While McAfee’s is the most famous of the view spots at this location, as we walked a little past there, we could see over Roanoke from the ledges sticking out from the mountain. Eventually the trail took us down and around to another ridge line. Again it was pretty gentle trail by AT standards. TheOkie was leading the way today, but as we were walking uphill at one point, about 6 black cows merged onto the trail and decided they wanted to follow the blazes and lead for a while. To be fair, we have seen numerous signs saying “no horses allowed on the trail”, but no signs addressing cows on the trail. Shortly after the cows allowed us to pass, we arrived at the Tinker Cliffs, the final feature of the Virginia Triple Crown along with Dragon’s Tooth and McAfee Knob. The views from the cliffs were not obstructed by the forest canopy and were some of the best views we have had on the trail. You had a great view down the valley and just an endless view of ridge line after ridge line. Coming down off the Tinker Cliffs, we met a mother/daughter thru hiker team Tie Dye Goat and her young daughter Sunflower. Tie Dye Goat’s husband, Ground Control is out for a visit and to do the Triple Crown section with them. We made it in to the Lamberts Meadow Shelter in time to set up our sleeping spots and have a late lunch.   After lunch, I took a shelter nap waiting for time to eat my tuna and tortilla dinner. Now it is time to put the bear bag in the bear box and call it an evening. We will be sharing the shelter with Bookmark and Ranch tonight. It was another great day and I got an iconic photo on the edge of McAfee Knob and lived to tell about it.","Catawba Mountain Shelter

Bookmark and Ranch were wanting to make the most of their time in Daleville, so they set an alarm for 5:30 am. They were fairly quiet packing up and we were not that ambitious, so we rolled out of the sleeping bags about 7:30. I’m pretty sure between the nap and the good night’s sleep, I racked up about 14 hours. If we recuperate in our sleep, I should be pretty well recuperated. 
It was windy and had rained a little bit by the time we we’re packed up and heading out. Not long into our hike, it got down to 38° and the gusty winds were spitting sleet on us. I had not started out in gloves and my fingers and frozen thumbs were asking me why. As we worked our way up higher, the climb warmed me up, but the winds were stronger. 
We made it to some ledges with incredible views of the valley below and the rows of mountains fading away in the distance. From this higher spot, we had cell signal that we didn’t have at last night’s shelter, so TheOkie and I were able to post yesterday’s journals. We took a few pictures, but it didn’t take long for the cold fingers to not want to work. 
Hiking on, the weather improved a bit. The rain quit and eventually we even got a bit of sun. The treadway today was mostly good, with lots of it covered in pine needles.  A few of the endless Mountain Laurels have started to bloom and the buds on most of the others look like they could pop at any time.  We also had a couple of sightings of a new tree blooming today, the White Fringetree.  I love walking along and seeing all of the beautiful reminders of God’s handiwork on a daily basis. How lucky we are to be able to experience all of the color and variety of wildflowers we have seen!  
At one point, we walked a ridge line with house sized boulders including Hay Rock which is an enormous slanted rock that provides a huge overhang. We stopped under the overhang for a quick snack. From the ridge line, you could look down over the scenic Carvin Cove Reservoir. 
As we descended toward town, we passed under huge power lines. One set was crackling and buzzing as you walked beneath it. I’m sure it’s safe, but we didn’t linger under it!  
When we reached Daleville, the trail crosses a very busy highway, US Route 220.  We patiently waited until there were no cars coming and safely made it to the median to repeat the process. Some helpful citizen yelled “GET OUT OF THE ROAD” at us while we stood in the large median, as they zipped by in their car. Sounded like solid advice, so when it was clear from the other direction, we left the safety of the median and crossed. 
On this side of the highway was a Super8 hotel. We walked down and checked in for the night. We have stayed at a number of Super8’s on this trip and this was by far the friendliest, most helpful, and most entertaining clerk we have encountered.        You can tell she gets a lot of thru hikers coming in and likes to have fun with them. Since we have been here, we have seen 4 Low, Trouble, Deliberate, Bookmark, Ranch, Possum, Peeps, Mad Dog, K, as well as other hikers we don’t know.  
Yesterday, Tie Dye Goat had made a good recommendation to us, so JFK got us an UBER and we went to try the burgers at Angelle’s Diner. On the way back to the hotel, the UBER had the same window malfunction that Mountain Mike had, except 2 windows wouldn’t go up. I was reminded of shuttle driver Grace talking about 2 window hikers. Once back at the hotel, we showered and did laundry. If we UBER out to get our groceries for resupply, I hope they will find us to be all windows up hikers. 
Daleville is the end of the Southern Virginia map on the FarOut navigation app. We have now walked 730.3 miles and moved our needle up to 33% of the trail. Tomorrow we should cross the 1/3 of the trail milestone. Through the end of this map section, we have now had 166,677 feet of ascent or 31.56 miles of climbing. 
Thank all of you that are praying for TheOkie’s shin splints. He was definitely doing better today. In his words, the shin was still talking to him, but it wasn’t yelling at him today. He continues to ice it and we will continue to keep our days shorter or slackpack for a while. Late in the day, I had stopped to text. When I started back, it took me forever to catch back up. So his speed has definitely returned.","Lamberts Meadow Shelter

This morning we walked out of the hotel about 8:30. The AT is just across the parking lot of the convenience store next door, so we were soon in the woods. Initially we could hear lots of road noise from the morning commuters on the highway we crossed yesterday as well as the nearby interstate. The loud car noises made us realize just how quiet the forests have been most of the time these last two months. 
Before long we turned out of the woods and into a well manicured park like area. We could tell that this stretch had really been taken care of. We had a short road walk under the interstate and when we left the roadway, we saw a laminated sign reading “1/3 of the way to Katahdin”.  Hard to imagine both that we have completed 1/3 of the trail, as well as the fact that we have 2/3 of the trail still ahead of us. 
After crossing another road, we came to a railroad track. On the side of the rails, in marker was the name Pink. We haven’t seen Pink since we were at Standing Bear, but it appears he is in the wild again. 
We hiked over a huge grassy bald and as we were coming down, I saw a very unusual bloom on a tree. It was colored similar to candy corn. I sent a picture to our research specialist for identification.   Soon my daughter had identified it as a Tulip Tree. She has been super helpful at identifying the flora of the trail when I have cell signal. I sent her another picture of a beautiful flower. Turns out it was Virginia Spiderwort, a very unfortunate name for such lovely purple and pink flowers. 
A bit later we saw a number written out in rocks. The number was 732.8. I checked the FarOut app and sure enough, we were standing right at mile 732.8, the ACTUAL 1/3 of the trail mark. There were fist bumps all around in celebration of this milestone. 
The weather was rather nice all day. It started off just barely warm enough for me to hike in shorts again. A far cry from the prior morning’s wind driven sleet. After a few climbs, I was able to peel off the jacket and felt fine in the wool T-shirt and shorts. 
The treadway was awesome for probably 90% of the day. A combination of pine needles and at times, small pea gravel type surfaces which were both easy in the feet. The grade today was also very favorable considering we had over 4,000 feet of climbing. The switchbacks were great and none of us felt like we had climbed that much. I’m no expert on causation versus correlation, but we were slack packing with very little in our backpacks today as well. 
Virtually the whole trail we have had stretches where we were walking in the green tunnel. Much of that has been thick sections of rhododendrons that we were walking through. Today, we passed through several sections of those, but they were definitely pink and green tunnels today, as we walked past thousands of rhododendron blooms in all shades of pink. 
At the end of our 14 mile hike, the trail spit us out on the Blueridge Parkway for the first time. We came out at the Taylor’s Mountain Overlook, one of many overlooks on the parkway. I have heard of this road for years, but this was my first time to be on it. We will spend a lot of time near it or crossing it over the next 120 miles. 
At the overlook, we were picked up by our shuttle driver, Homer. Homer and his family thru hiked the trail over 20 years ago.  He showed us a really cool children’s book that was written about his young daughter’s experience hiking the trail back then.  We also found out that Homer has been maintaining the park like section of the trail that we noticed this morning. Over 30 years ago it was a wild section of thorns and brambles, but he has worked tirelessly for years to make it into the beautiful setting it is today. 
Homer will be shuttling us again tomorrow as we slackpack again. This has allowed us to move our mileage back up while still nursing TheOkie’s shin splints. He handled today’s 14 miles great and we are optimistic his shin will continue to make improvements.  
This evening we went to  Three Little Pigs BBQ for supper and then walked over to Kroger for snacks and a light resupply.   As we were heading out to dinner, we ran into Bluegrass who we hadn’t seen since around Big Bald. It was fun to catch up on what’s been going on with him.  It was another great day on the AT!","US Route 220 Daleville

Our shuttle was a little delayed picking us up, but had us in the woods by 10:00. Teresa, Homer’s wife was super friendly and we enjoyed visiting with her on the ride out. We actually walked southbound today and ended up at the same place as yesterday, just from the opposite direction. We came across many hikers headed northbound and knew 4 Low, 7-11, Mad Dog, Possum, Bookmark, Ranch, and the section hiking brothers that we had met yesterday. The Jennings Creek area where we started out, was beautiful but as soon as we hit the woods, it was up, up, up.  Our hike today paralleled the Blue Ridge Parkway quite a bit and actually crossed the road a number of times.  Most of the crossings have been at overlooks with spectacular views. One of the overlooks was Peaks Of Otter Overlook. Imagine my sadness when I finally arrived at the overlook, and there were in fact, no otters. Who can you trust these days?!?!  The weather was absolutely great today with sunny blue skies, calm winds, and temperatures in the 50’s and 60’s most of the day. The treadway was 90% great again today walking on pine needles or pea gravel for the most part. The grade had more steep sections today than yesterday, but honestly with light packs, we all zipped straight up the mountain in those spots.I would say that today had the most spectacular display of flowers of the trip so far. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say we saw over a million blooms today!  The rhododendrons and Spiderworts were really showing out. At one point while walking along a ridge where I had signal, I FaceTimed my parents as I walked along just so they could share in the incredible sights. I was also able to get a birthday visit in with my son today which was nice. We don’t always have signal in the woods, but today I had pretty good coverage. I also managed to not fall while walking along looking at the phone with both trekking poles in one hand. So, that was a plus. Late in the hike, we walked beside an enormous retaining wall built of giant rectangular stones. The trail followed along beside it, starting at the bottom and climbing probably 30 feet to the top.  Homer picked us up at he end of our hike and delivered us to Angelle’s  Diner for food.  We Ubered back to the hotel and TheOkie and I walked across the parking lot to the convenience store for a couple of final resupply items and a snack for tonight. While there, Trail Bob and Brightside hiked in. They will be staying at the hotel tonight. Today’s miles moved our imaginary needle up to 34%. Tomorrow we will be dropped off at Jennings Creek again to walk north with our full packs. TheOkie continues to make progress, but isn’t 100% yet. Two days from now we should be in Glasgow, Virginia and may have opportunities for additional slack packing.  I don’t think the flowers have peaked yet, so I can’t wait to see what the coming days hold for us.","Taylor’s Mountain Overlook

It was a 14 mile day with over 5,000 feet of elevation gain. The elevation gain started the minute we got out of the shuttle and didn’t really let up all day. It was a bit rockier than the last few days had been, but was the same beautiful weather. The Rhododendrons weren’t blooming on today’s walk, but the trillium blooms made up for them. They came in all shades of pink and white and were everywhere. We also found the elusive yellow lady slipper. Our shuttle driver said that they existed, but with all of the pink ones we have seen, this was the only yellow one we have come across. About 5 miles into the hike we stopped by the Bryant Ridge Shelter for a quick drink and to look around. It is described on FarOut as a towering double decker with room for 20 people. It is probably the fanciest shelter we have seen on trail this far. Leaving there, it was more up, up, up. We met a ridge runner named Noodles and stopped to visit with her for a few minutes. She is the first ridge runner we have seen since Moxie back in Georgia. We also passed Silva, who is back on trail after having to get off during her previous thru hike attempt. I had watched some of her YouTube hike videos last year while walking on the treadmill.  She also joined us around the picnic table and visited over dinner, as did Cherry, Operator, and Aileron.   We also took the short side trail to Black Rock Overlook where the views were fantastic.  Serendipity was perched on the tallest rock there and pointing out the views to us. As we climbed even more near the end of the day, we reached the top of Apple Orchard Mountain where the FAA has a long range air traffic radar facility. The enormous white soccer ball looking sphere filled the sky. A short walk past there, we reached the trail-famous rock formation known as the guillotine. It has a huge bolder, that the trail leads you directly under, suspended in the air between two massive rocks. We joke every day about the trail designers taking us up over every mountain because there was a rock on top that they wanted to show us. In this instance, I think that was actually the case, an unusual and interesting rock formation that was worth walking up to. We have now moved the needle to a respectable 35%!  We had a hard day, but we all handled it all very well. TheOkie continues to make progress with his shin. We may have some opportunities to slack pack when we reach Glasgow.  That would allow for some more light days and hopefully continue to speed the healing process.","Jennings Creek

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663393,"“Sweet April showers do spring May flowers.” -Thomas Tusser After my early bedtime last night, another hiker rolled into the shelter. The shelter was fairly noisy and the bright moon was shining in on us as well, so it wasn’t my best night of sleep on trail. About 5:30 the birds started urging us up. We wound up getting up around 6:30 and having breakfast with Operator, Cherry, Silva, K, Diving Swan, and Aileron. By 7:30 we were walking. Although today was mostly downhill, it wasn’t without its ups and there was a lot more rocky terrain than the last few days.  A few sections were also flanked by thigh high grass. Some places look like they have been cut down with a weed eater, but we out hiked the weed eater operator. I think they need to import some of the feral goats from Peters Mountain to finish the job. Like the last several days, the flowers were spectacular!  Starting out, there were violets lining the trail and before long, as TheOkie said, we were standing among trilliums of trilliums. There were fields full of the large blooms in all shades of pink. At  one point, we popped up over another ridge and were immediately met with amazing purple spiderworts followed quickly by yellow lady slippers. Towards the end of the day, we hit the rhododendrons in full large pink bloom and mountain laurels starting to open up their red streaked, white blooms. It is hard to adequately describe what beauty we get to walk through right now. We also had a few overlooks today where we were able to capture the iconic views of mountains behind mountains behind mountains. Those sights just never get old. We could also see back across the mountains we had walked today and see the tiny dot of the FAA sphere we walked by yesterday. The final views we got were of our last trail highlight of the day, the James River Foot Bridge. This nearly 1,000 foot long bridge is the longest foot bridge on the AT. Also, fun fact, we think it is the only 1,000 foot flat and smooth section of the trail so far!  Earlier in the day, JFK had pulled up the radar and noticed a huge thunderstorm heading this way.  Looking at the up to the minute forecast we knew that it would hit close to the time we were getting picked up. As we crossed the James River Foot Bridge, Spotter met us and quickly loaded our packs. Just as we shut the doors, the rains hit. A few minutes later we were at Stanimals 328 Hostel in Glasgow, Virginia.  After getting the tour, we loaded up and went to the only restaurant in Glasgow, Scotto’s Italian. We ate while the storm blew over, then went across the road to the grocery store for snacks and light resupply. We then road walked the half mile back to the hostel.   After showers and laundry, the hostel served grilled polish sausage and chips for supper. Now we are sitting around planning tomorrow’s slack pack, working on our journals, and watching people try out the massage chair. With us at the hostel are Black Beard, Serendipity, 4Low, 7-11(who is on YouTube under Journey to the Destination), Possum, Bookmark, Ranch, Lizard, and several others I do not know yet. We’re expecting a warm hike tomorrow and hoping that the flower extravaganza continues.","Thunder Hill Shelter

Weidenbenner Stanimals was very accommodating. Like so accommodating that it’s a good thing Glasgow doesn’t have a fire Marshall. I had a bunk, JFK scored a couch, and TheOkie had the floor space in front of the front door. There were people in recliners and people tented on the lawn. It was a bit of chaos, but they definitely made it work and as I said, were quite accommodating. After a near sleepless night in one of the loud bunk rooms, I was treated to blueberry pancakes. When the blueberry pancakes were gone, I had pineapple pancakes. It takes A LOT of pancakes to feed this many hungry hikers!  After breakfast, I removed most of the contents of my backpack and placed them on a bottom bunk for tonight. Then Charlie shuttled us as well as K2 and Blue to US Route 60 to hike the 22 miles back to Glasgow.  K2 had the unenviable spot of riding behind the backseat with the packs for the long, twisting ride. The distance was a bit farther than our original plan, but it seemed to be our only slackpacking option for some reason. My main concern was TheOkie’s healing shin, but he didn’t protest. We were told by Charlie that the first 5 miles would be great, and they were, both in treadway and grade. At various parts of the day, the rocks and the steep ups and downs came out.   With about 4,300 feet of climb and 5,700 feet of descent, most of the day was spent on the steep ups and steep  downs. Yesterday’s rains brought out our tiny orange lizard friends in full force. TheOkie and JFK were spotting them left and right. A month ago I would have told you that todays wildflower display was incredible, but like a lot of things, we have been spoiled by the last week. There were definitely spectacular flowers in display today, just not with every step like we have become accustomed to. At one point I was able to FaceTime a friend with a belated birthday tour of Appalachian Trail wildflowers. It was fun to share what we’ve been seeing with people that are excited about the trail.  We stopped in to the unmarked water source Charlie had told us about. It was about 10 miles until the next water, and on a day that got over 80° we were glad he pointed it out. When we arrived, Black Beard and Serendipity were there for a break as well. They had been dropped off on the opposite end of our same slackpack. Just before noon, we crossed the 800 mile mark. Just the thought of walking 800 miles seems crazy. To think we still have about 1,400 more miles to walk IS crazy! Someone had taken the time to arrange pinecones in the shape of 800 to commemorate the event, so we stopped for photos and a round of fist bumps. We couldn’t linger too long though because we had to get back to the hostel for a special dinner. We arrived 6 minutes early for the hostel pickup at the James River. During our hike we also ran into K, Willin, Possum, 4 Low, Bookmark, Ranch, and several others. Once we got back JFK & TheOkie got a quick shower, but then the Episcopal church people showed up to get the hikers. I hopped into the bed of a pickup with a group of hikers as others filled up several cars for the half mile drive to the church. You see, Scotto’s, the only restaurant in this small town closes on Monday, so the wonderful people of the Episcopal church host a pasta dinner for hikers every Monday in May and June. The food was great, but just the welcoming nature and the compassion for others was even greater. After the meal, they went around the room and had each hiker share their trail name, where they were from, and any other comment’s they wanted to share. It was very special and a great outreach from the church. Back at the hostel, I quickly grabbed a shower and then did laundry again. I thought it would be a good idea to knock the salt off of both my body and my clothes before we head out in the woods tomorrow since we will be out for several days. We planned our resupply to get us to Waynesboro, the gateway to the Shenandoah area.  Our big mile day moved our needle up to 36%!  We have hiked about 340 miles in Virginia and still have about 200 more miles to go in the state. We don’t have the Virginia blues, but are looking forward to hitting Shenandoah and also looking forward to knocking out the other states.","Stanimals 328 Hostel Glasgow, Virginia

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663521,"“Pain is inevitable.  Suffering is optional.” - Haruki MurakamiI had a surprisingly good night’s sleep in the bunk room. When the hostel came alive a bit after 6 am, we had blueberry pancakes and peach pancakes. I had quite a few of both. After breakfast, I walked down to the grocery store and bought the final resupply items I need for the next leg of the trip. As we were walking back to the hostel, a car pulled over and gave us a ride. It was Charlie who had shuttled us yesterday. When we got out at the hostel, Trouble and Deliberate were standing there. When we greeted them, Deliberate said, oh it’s  JFK’s Group. So TheOkie and I have adopted a new name. We’ve been called The Trio, The Three Amigos, and even Adorable, but this one might just stick. We were the final group to be shuttled back to the trail today. When we eventually got started walking, it was about 10:00, kind of a late start for us. We were greeted immediately with a soul sucking climb of 2,000 feet in elevation gain in the first 3 miles. TheOkie led the way again today and he was striding it out. Late in the day, our phones alerted us to an approaching thunderstorm. It became a race to see if we could get to the shelter before it rained. We won. Actually, even though it got dark, the temperature dropped about 12°, and we heard some thunder, it never rained at the shelter. In the middle of the hike, we passed Black Beard and Serendipity who were sitting in a meadow having a snack. While we were there, a very pretty bird with a blue back perched on the water sign in front of us. I sent the picture to the research department and shortly it came back as a Tree Swallow along with a note that she was shocked that the name didn’t have blue in it. I agreed, it seemed like a dull name for a pretty bird. At least it wasn’t some kind of a wort since it wasn’t a plant. We also passed by the remnants of an old stacked stone wall. When I see things like that, I wish I knew the stories behind them. It was another good wildflower day full of violets, trillium, flaming azalea, and many others. Again, if it weren’t for last week’s extravaganza, the amount of flowers would seem incredible.  We had many great views again today. Fortunately we stopped to take them in during the steep early morning climbs. During the afternoon race with the rain, we didn’t really slow down for them that much. When we arrived at the shelter, I immediately went to collect water since I had just finished the liter I had started the day with.  The spring here was .1 miles down a side trail and it was gushing cold water. There was one person at the shelter when we arrived. His name is Darrell and he retired from Tinker Air Force Base and lives in Oklahoma City. We visited with him quite a bit while having dinner. K2 is tenting at this site and also joined us around the picnic table for dinner. My dinner tonight consisted of two Spam and Extra Toasty Cheezits wraps, in flour tortillas along with the snacks that we didn’t slow down to eat today. For dessert, TheOkie had packed out chocolate dipped pretzels to celebrate our completion of 800 trail miles. As we were finishing up dinner, preparing to brush our teeth and hang our bear bags, another hiker showed up. It was Freyja, who had been in our shelter the first few nights when we started the trail, but we had last seen by Watauga Lake a month ago. The universe has a way of crossing paths. Today’s miles budged that needle up to 37%. Tomorrow’s forecast is for warm temperatures, sunny skies, and lots more climbing.","US Route 60

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663597,"“Confession is good for the soul.” As the sky began to lighten up, even before the sun rose, we knew that the shelter opening faced roughly east. It was a cool morning, about 48° in the shelter and people started rousing a bit earlier than usual with the bright light. As we were finishing breakfast, a section hiker that was a friend of Darrell hiked in. He had been sick and said he was finally able to keep a bit of ramen down. He asked if anyone had an extra spoon and a lighter.  There were no takers on the spoon, but being good hearted, TheOkie got out his lighter and handed it to him. After he lit his stove, he headed the lighter back. JFK and I looked at each other in horror as we contemplated exactly when the norovirus would hit JFK’s Group. Later when discussing the episode, TheOkie assured us that he immediately slathered himself with hand sanitizer while putting the lighter away. We were walking just after 7:30. About 2 1/2 miles in we had climbed up to the camping area below Spy Rock. K had just broken camp and suggested that we leave our backpacks down there while we climbed the short side trail up to the summit and that he would watch them. That was an excellent suggestion. We climbed up to the top of the giant granite outcropping. The views were astounding 360° around us. We could see mountains after mountains and were pretty sure they fell in one of two categories: those we have climbed and those we will have to climb. The designers of the trail definitely didn’t want us to feel short changed. After several minutes of taking in the views and getting a few photos, we headed back down Spy Rock. K hiked along with JFK’s Group until we started up the two mile, 600 foot  climb to the Priest Shelter in the Priest Mountain Wilderness.  One of the amusing AT traditions is that hikers can confess their trail-sins in the logbook at the priest Shelter. We hiked in to get water, have a snack, and read the logbook. It did not disappoint. These confessions included not digging their cat holes the proper 6 inches deep, stealing toilet paper from every hostel they stayed at, and not digging a cat hole at all & not feeling bad about it because it was in Tennessee.  There were also confessions of sleeping with their food in their tent instead of hanging it in a bear bag, and even one confessing to wanting to beat up a certain hiker who has written his name in thick black magic marker on every shelter, signpost, and privy since we started the trail. One person confessed to removing another hiker’s laundry from the dryer at a hostel so they could dry their clothes. The problem was they placed the other hiker’s laundry on a table that happened to be used for loaner clothes and they didn’t realize it until they saw various people wearing the other hiker’s clothes. As you might imagine, there were others, but some were better off left unprinted. Leaving the Priest Shelter, we had a 3,000 foot descent which was easy on the lungs, but hard on the knees. Once we crossed the Tye River suspension bridge, it was a 900 foot climb the last 2 1/2 miles to get to camp.  The shelter is in a beautiful setting with a great creek with small waterfalls about 30 feet in front of it. When we arrived hot and soaked in sweat, the creek looked very inviting. Even though it gave me goosebumps, I went down to the creek (downstream from where we get our water) and wet my bandanna and washed the salt off of me. I also washed the tan off of my legs. Turns out it was dirt and I’m still pale enough to blind other hikers. It felt like having a spa day. We had a very early dinner and did our evening chores. Now it’s looking like a 6:30 bedtime.  It was a beautiful day with great weather.  The wildflowers weren’t quite as abundant today, but there were many of them and several different varieties. Todays miles moved the needle up to the 38% notch. Tomorrow morning starts with a 2,100 foot climb in the first 3 miles so we are hoping for a good night’s sleep.","Seeley - Woodworth Shelter

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663634,"“Great opportunities to help others seldom come, but small ones surround us every day.” –  Sally Koch The Harper’s Creek shelter is in such a deep gap, surrounded by giant trees, that we slept in until 7 in the dark shelter. After we had gone to bed last night, Darrell had hiked in and joined us in the shelter. I vaguely recall another hiker or two dropping by the picnic table when they reached camp last night, but I didn’t really fully wake up. We were on the trail by 8:15 and started off with some up followed by some REAL up. The climb up Three Ridges was over 2,000 feet in the first three miles. Sections of the climb were more like rock climbing, going straight up the rocks.  There were several great view spots along the climb and they were very welcome not only for the views, but also to catch our breath. On the way down, we reached Hanging Rock Overlook, a huge rock slab exposed on the side of the mountain.  The views were so great there that we stopped for an extra long break for snacks, a drink, and to just enjoy the mountains on a beautiful sunny day. We may not have been there a full hour, but it’s probably the longest we have sat in the sun taking in the view on the trip so far. A half mile down trail we stopped at a water source. This was the last water for a long way, but was plenty to get us to the end of our day. As we hiked away from the water source, TheOkie saw a 3 foot long black rat snake starting across the trail. He wasn’t blocking the trail, so we slid on past him. As we walked to the road crossing at Reid’s Gap, we joked as we often do, that it sure would be a great place for trail magic. As we crossed the parking area and back into the woods, there were no signs of trail magic to be had.  The comment was made that Virginia sure missed a good opportunity there and we laughed and walked on. A half mile later, a man with a dog was walking down the trail towards us. He asked TheOkie if we were thru hikers. When TheOkie replied that we were, he said to  stop at his van in the parking area just ahead on the trail. At that point, he and his dog took off running out of sight. I asked TheOkie if we had just seen a mirage after our hot, hard morning of climbing, but he assured me the man was real. In a minute, we popped out of the woods and sure enough, there sat a  converted Dodge pro master camper van with the door open, an area rug spread out, and milk crate chairs spaced around. We were immediately greeted by the smiling face of Beamer and their doodle, Beans. The man we had seen earlier, Nugget, emerged from the kitchen of the van with 3 large, fresh, very special sub sandwiches with ham, spinach, and Siracha mayonnaise.   They explained that they had hiked the trail in 2018 and someone had given them trail magic of a great sandwich with siracha mayonnaise and they thought about that sandwich the rest of their hike. They picked the Three Ridges Overlook for several intentional reasons. They remembered how hard the climbs were the last couple of days up The Priest and Three Ridges. They remembered by about this point in the trail, they had felt a bit homesick and needed some encouragement. And the view at this particular overlook is just stunning.  The sandwiches were incredible, but the people were even far better. They were so kind and encouraging. We sat there visiting for again what seemed like an hour and when we hiked on, it was like leaving old friends. They are an incredible young couple who really have the gifts of hospitality and encouragement and we were blessed to be the recipients of their trail magic. Virginia didn’t miss that opportunity, they will go down as one of our fondest memories of the state. When we reached our pickup point at the end of the hike our shuttle driver wasn’t there, but a lady getting in her car told us she had just seen a bear about a quarter mile up the trail. So while TheOkie stayed to watch for the shuttle, JFK and I headed up the trail in search of a bear. We didn’t find it, but that is where we start hiking tomorrow, so maybe it will be around then. When our shuttle did show up, we were quite surprised to see that it was Spotter who had shuttled us back in Glasgow. It seems that there were a lot of problems in the local hostel, so he had been brought up to help get things straightened out. He arranged to get us shuttled back in the morning when we will walk to the entrance of Shenandoah National Park.  Once he dropped us at the hotel, due to some of the aforementioned chaos at the hostel, we quickly showered and walked down to an upscale burger bar that had been recommended to us twice in our first hour in Waynesboro. My burger with bacon and a sunny side up egg on it was good, but a bit messy to eat. We were surprised by what an artsy place Waynesboro was. We passed theaters, museums, and galleries in our very short walk. Next it was a walk to the store to resupply food and get a few snacks. Then laundry time and now to bed to get ready for an early morning.","Harper’s Creek Shelter

""Owl hasn't exactly got brain, but he knows things."" - A. A. Milne The alarm went off at 6 this morning because we had an early shuttle to catch. Not knowing what time the hotel breakfast started, I ate second breakfast first and then went downstairs to have breakfast.  JFK, TheOkie, and I were joined by Blue at breakfast and visited about our current hikes as well as trail characters we had encountered in the past. Before I had gone back upstairs to finish getting ready for the hike, our shuttle arrived, a bit more than 20 minutes early. We all scrambled around and we got going pretty quickly. We shared the shuttle with Rock Lizard and her dad, Branch since we were all hiking the same section. Once Spotter delivered us to Dripping Rock, we hit the trail on a gorgeous morning. Today’s hike wasn’t as strenuous as the last few days, but the treadway remained pretty rocky for most of the day.  There was still a variety of wildflowers, but not the volume that there was recently. After our first big climb we had a nice view from some rock ledges. Across the valley you could see rows of condos lining what appeared to be a ski resort. None of us knew that there was snow skiing here.  We walked past many more old, stacked-stone walls. We all wondered about their origin and history. Early in the hike we came across our first metal-banded concrete pillar like they use for trail navigation in Shenandoah. A little while later as we were hiking along, a rather large owl flew up from where it was having a trail-side meal and landed on a tree a few yards away. We stood and watched it as it perched and watched us. It eventually won the stare-down as we hiked on. Just as we left, we encountered an excited group of day hikers who said that they had just seen a copperhead on the trail. After JFK walked them up to point out the owl, we started down the trail keeping an even closer eye than usual on the landing spots for our feet. We never saw a copperhead on the trail, but about ten minutes later I saw a large writhing mass of black rat snake just off the trail.  It must have been the rare Siamese black rat snake because it had two heads. Soon, one head looked like it was moon-walking as it was being dragged backwards into the woods by the other head. Someone in the group said we wouldn’t have seen them at all if we hadn’t stopped to see where the Barry White music was coming from. A bit before noon, we stopped in to the Paul Wolfe Shelter to have a snack and get water. There was one very interesting individual in the shelter when we arrived. Definitely not a typical thru hiker and gave all of us the vibe that raised our red flags. We didn’t have a negative encounter with him, but we were ready to put some distance between us. About an hour later we hiked past the old stacked-stone fireplace that is the only thing remaining of the W J Mayo Homeplace. A note in the FarOut app says that legend has it that this was where mayonnaise was invented!  I might have to call out the fact-checkers on that one. We received trail magic again today from Snickers. She is out visiting her husband Aileron, and was hiking up the trail with a backpack of Snickers to give to thru hikers. We appreciated the treat and it was good to meet a fellow thru hiker’s wife. As we made our way out of the woods at Rockfish Gap, we crossed a bridge over the interstate. I knew it was coming before it happened, but I watched TheOkie pump his arm up and down in the air until he got a semi to honk its horn just like one of his trail heroes, Hawk does. It never gets old. That is just one of the Hawkisms we have brought to the trail. Another is that the first of us to spot another hiker, or any person, alerts the others by saying, stranger danger. It’s funny the things we picked up from the years of videos and journals that have made their way into our hike. From the bridge, we walked the .3 miles up to the kiosk in the woods where we got our Shenandoah National Park thru hiker permits. The permit is free for thru hikers, but you have to have it on your pack as you pass through the park. After the .3 miles back down, we caught a shuttle back to the hotel. After getting cleaned up, we Ubered out to eat and now it’s time for an earlier bedtime. We have a big day tomorrow and you never know just how early the shuttle might show up.","Dripping Rock Parking Area

The alarm went off at 6 again this morning to catch the 7:30 shuttle. After yesterday’s experience we hurried through breakfast and back to the room to get everything situated in case they were 20 minutes early again. That was not to be the case. They had some driver issues and I couldn’t get in touch with our driver. I tried 4 people listed on a sheet of local shuttlers, but didn’t have any luck. About 8:30, our driver texted and said he could pick us up at 9:00. When he arrived, we hopped in the van to head to Blackrock Gap where we were going to slackpack back to Waynesboro. 
We were on the trail by 9:45 with 20 miles to hike and rain in the forecast. We looked at the concrete marker post with the metal band telling us where to go, and away we went. TheOkie has been leading while he rehabs his shin. Today he started out like a racehorse. The treadway at the beginning was some of the best we have seen. To be fair, although there were rocky sections towards the end, the overall treadway would have to rate at least an A-.

The forecasted rain did materialize for about 5 miles. We stopped briefly to put on rain jackets. The trail was so nice that I got out my umbrella and just carried it in one hand and my trekking poles in the other. Most of the trail I’ve had a death grip on both poles and they have definitely saved me from countless falls. 
The only viable water for the 20 miles was in 2 locations about ten miles in and about a mile apart. We stopped briefly at the first one and drank a liter of water and refilled a liter for the final ten miles. We also had a snack there at the water source and didn’t really have any big stops on the day. 
We met our 4th ridge runner, Bushman, but I only talked to him for a second before I started falling behind TheOkie. We met Mad Dog and Willin, as well as several hikers we didn’t know, hiking up the trail towards us.  
We climbed over a mountain that had lots of cell tower type of equipment on top. Just below the towers were several different colored tractor seats mounted in the ground as chairs. It was kind of unexpected in such an out of the way place. 
When we reached the kiosk where we had gotten our permits yesterday, I called for a shuttle to take us back to the hotel. Just then, the heaviest rain of the day started, so we put our rain jackets back on and I grabbed my umbrella. We walked the .3 miles to the pickup point and waited there with Pusher and Morning Glory.   Soon after the rain quit, Spotter picked us up and delivered us to the hotel. 
After  a good shower to take the mud off of my calves where my muddy shoes had brushed up against them throughout the day, we headed out to a Mexican restaurant. Once we returned it was laundry time so we will hike out tomorrow in clean, DRY, clothes.  It is supposed to be a sunny week and I am looking forward to that.  
We have completed the first 20 miles of the approximately 105 miles of the AT in Shenandoah National Park. Today, our needle reaches another big milestone as we have completed 40% of the AT!  
This afternoon I got a call from the hostel that had shuttled us to the 20 mile slackpack. They asked who was leading today, and I told them that it was TheOkie. His name will be placed at the top of the leader board for hiking that particular section the fastest of all the people they have shuttled there.  He also receives a T-shirt to commemorate that honor.

After the very touching ceremony, we loaded up with Blue and Itchy Feet and headed to the trailhead. As we were leaving the trailhead, Spotter sent us the picture of the leader board showing where TheOkie had ripped the title from the hands of Baby Shark. We were hiking by 8:05 and 15 minutes later we had a wildlife encounter. TheOkie was leading us up the trail when he suddenly came to a stop and motioned for us to be quiet. JFK and I silently inched forward to see what he was seeing, and there it was, staring back at us, a large turkey hen. We stood there looking at it and it stood there looking at us. Then it started down the trail, TOWARDS us. It kept walking towards us until it came up to TheOkie and started pecking on his shoes. We finally gave up on the battle of wills and moved on up the trail. We asked TheOkie if he would show the same resolve and stand there motionless if it were a bear instead of a turkey. He thought his body might have some involuntary reactions if that were to happen.  We hiked up to an overlook with great views. This morning’s views were extra special, as the valleys were full of thick white clouds and the mountaintops were peeking up over the clouds. We hiked by some trail runners and a few minutes later when we stopped at another nice view spot, they came running by. They stopped and took a picture of us so we could all three be in it. In return, I took a picture for them. However, they wanted a jumping picture and it took me two tries to get the timing down. Eight miles into the day, we came to a very short side trail to the Loft Mountain Camp Store. We hiked up there and Camp Stores are my new favorite things. They had nice clean bathrooms, showers, water fountains, trash cans, and picnic tables. Inside the store, there was a tremendous selection of food and drinks as well as camping supplies. They even had smoothies and milkshakes. We made our selections and went out to the picnic tables to enjoy the perfect weather. We invited another hiker to join us. Then it happened, we found out their trail name was Baby Shark. Awkward. She seems to have moved past her loss and even hiked to our same hut for the night, although she did sleep off in the corner.   Actually all is good with Baby Shark.  She even read us bedtime stories from her Law School Summer Class textbook. Maps also showed up at the Camp Store and is in the hut with us tonight. We last were with him at Dragon’s Tooth, 200 trail miles ago. Today is Mother’s Day and I was able to get a cell signal and call my mother and my wife to wish them a happy Mother’s Day.  It was another wonderful day on the AT with perfect weather, great friends, new friends, good hiking, and funny wildlife.","Blackrock Gap Trailhead

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663828,"“Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after the other.” -Walter Elliot  This morning we got up early in the hut and headed to the trail by 7:30. We knew we only had about a mile and a half to a big milestone. We saw the rocks forming 900 and stopped for our pictures to commemorate the occasion. A round of fist bumps later we were moving again. Although we’ve been told Shenandoah is flat, we managed to climb over 4,000 feet again today. As we climbed high top mountain, a couple up there told us that there was a large trail magic setup 1.7 miles downhill. We cruised down the trail, fueled by the hope of the goodies waiting for us. As we popped out at the high top summit trailhead, we could see Caveman had a pop up tent and several chairs set up. As we approached, he offered us homemade chili, chips, drinks, cookies, fruit, and veggies. It was overwhelming and so, so good. Caveman’s son did the trail years ago and really appreciated the trail magic he had received. He coached Caveman on the things hikers want and need. Boy did he nail it. Caveman sets up at that exact site several times a year, and the universe crossed our paths today. We all couldn’t be happier and were so appreciative. After 2 bowls of chili, 2 Pepsi’s, chips and cookies, I had to drag myself away. We still had 10 more miles to the campground and more importantly the camp store that closed at 5:00. JFK led the way and we were buying goodies from the store by 4:00. We also ran into Blue at the store. We decided that the three of us as well as Baby Shark and Maps would get a campsite and put our 5 tents on it. While we were setting up our tents, Baby Shark went and paid for the site and wouldn’t let us pay her back. We got trail magic from another hiker. Now we are all sitting around the campsite picnic table having dinner on a cool evening. It was a beautiful day for hiking, another trip to a camp store, trail magic twice, and knocked out another 20 miles of Shenandoah. That moves our imaginary needle to 41% completed. It’s still hard to believe we have walked over 900 miles!","Pinefield Hut

Before 5:30, the trees of the campground erupted into a cacophony of bird noises punctuated by the booming hoot of an enthusiastic owl. I hadn’t worn ear plugs on this snore-free night outdoors, but they would have been handy at that moment. It was beginning to become light even though the humidity and dripping from the trees indicated that we were in a cloud. I pulled the sleeping bag over my head and fell back to sleep in my new quiet darkness.  At 6:30, I started making the preparations for the day. As I packed up my condensation covered tent I remembered why I like the shelter morning routine so well. 
The fist bumps with Baby Shark after breakfast were a bit sad. She is a section hiker and we most likely won’t see her again. She is bright and fun to be around and the three of us know she has a great future ahead of her. Maps wasn’t around when we headed off, but I bet the universe crosses our paths again in the future just like it did after our last 200 mile gap. He also is very bright. We discussed what a great future the world has with young people like these out there. We have certainly enjoyed hiking and camping around them the last few days.  I think they find the three goofy old guys ok to be around, too.  Sadly, it will be harder to tease TheOkie about winning the race he didn’t know he was in, without Baby Shark around.  
Today we were hiking to Skyland Resort to get picked up and taken to the town of Luray. I have a Zoom meeting tomorrow and needed reliable WiFi and a quiet space. Also, TheOkie’s wife and a couple of friends will be coming out tomorrow so we will be meeting up with them. My wife and daughter are coming out and all of us are planning some zero time to do some sightseeing in Harper’s Ferry and DC. There are a lot of moving parts in all of this as we still need to make miles in the mornings to get JFK closer to a major airport for an upcoming wedding. I’m not sure exactly how everything will go, but I’m totally confident that it will all work out and it will be absolutely wonderful to see everyone. 
We didn’t really stop much on today’s hike.  Starting out it was so foggy that there wasn’t any reason to take side trails to views. A section hiker, All Trails hiked with us for a while but eventually pulled off. 
At one point, we hiked by the largest pile of bear scat we have ever seen. As one of the group commented, it was like a Jurassic Park sized pile of bear scat. It was located squarely in the middle of the trail. We were unsure if that would give any clarity to the age old question, since it was on a trail, but the trail itself was in the woods.  The trail also went by the Tanner’s Ridge Cemetery where we stopped and visited with a couple of hikers from South Florida.  They have followed several of the same vloggers that we followed in preparation for our hike. 
As the day went on, the sun burned away the clouds and we had several spectacular views. We crossed Stony Man Mountain, which at 3,972 feet is one of the tallest points in Shenandoah National Park. We also crossed a few designated “scree fields” where jumbles of large rocks went from the top of the mountain to the bottom. The massive quantities of rocks reminded us of the majority of today’s treadway. With the toll the rocks took on our feet today, we fear northern Pennsylvania where the rocks are so bad they refer to the region as Rocksylvania. 
Toward the end of the hike, TheOkie made an interesting discovery.   Often a bird will fly out from the edge of the trail just before we get there. Today he found a tiny moss and grass nest with the four tiniest eggs just under the edge of a large rock lining the trail.  
We made it to Skyland before our shuttle, but just minutes after the Starbucks with grab and go sandwiches closed. There was a gift shop that had a decent selection of snacks, so we grabbed a few of those. 
When Allison of Open Arms Hostel showed up we piled in her van just as it started raining. We then stopped to pick up three young ladies that graduated from graduate school last weekend and are off to celebrate with a week of backpacking. 
On the way to town, Allison had to pull over to make a phone call. Fate was on our side as she pulled over in a Dairy Queen parking lot. We bolted out of the van and grabbed the blizzards we have been craving since Salem. 
Then she gave us the Luray tour as she delivered us to our motel for the evening. Two doors down was Jess’ hot dog grill. We stopped in for dinner where I had three absolutely delicious chili dogs. And a BLT. Then it was next door to the Shell station for the evening’s snacks. 
Now it’s time to clean up and rest up. After my meeting in the morning we are heading out for a short day, but will at least knock out a few miles. Today’s miles pushed the needle up to 42%, so we’re still making headway.","Lewis Mountain Campground

This morning TheOkie and I got up and walked a couple of blocks from the motel to a convenience store with a grill to get a quick breakfast. When we we entered, the lady showed us the breakfast menu taped to the counter. TheOkie said he’d like 2 sausage egg and cheese croissants. The lady wrote it down, went over and cracked the eggs on the griddle, and continued to cook his entire order. She served him, rang him up, and then asked me what I wanted. I told her and she started preparing it. My sausage and egg biscuit was tasty, but it didn’t quite turn out to be a quick breakfast. I can only imagine the line at rush hour if she completes each order before taking the next one. 
At one point, while we were still eating and the only ones in there, the lady went to the bathroom. Sure enough a customer came in. They looked around for a while for an employee, but none was to be found. I kept thinking, I hope they don’t think this is a robbery or we abducted the clerk. I was relieved when the lady finally emerged from the bathroom. 
The reason for going into town yesterday was so I could take a meeting on Zoom this morning. I was glad that I made it back in time for that. After my meeting concluded, I stepped outside where TheOkie had been enjoying the nice morning, and his wife and friends from Oklahoma had arrived. 
TheOkie, JFK, and I loaded our packs in their car and headed to Skyline Drive.  TheOkie’s college roommate and longtime friend, David was joining us for a slackpack today. The wives dropped us off at Skyland Resort and the four of us headed north on the AT. 
About a half mile into our hike, we came across Maps, Rock Lizard, and Branch. We visited with them a bit while we all stopped to watch a deer beside the trail. We again visited with them at Little Stony Man Cliffs. These cliffs provided some truly amazing views of the mountain range surrounding us and the expansive valley below us. 
Later in our hike we noticed a really long yellow tape measure stretched from the woods, across the trail, and off into the woods again. Upon further observation, we noticed there was a lady in the woods near the measuring tape. The nice young lady turned out to be an employee of the USGS and she was surveying for a rare salamander that is found in that area. 
As JFK was talking to her from the switchback above her, and then the switchback below her, she said she had spotted one of the salamanders under a rotting log. She placed it in a baggie to measure it and brought it down to the trail so we could see it.  That was very nice of her. 
We hiked on to The Byrd’s Nest Hut and stopped in for a snack and to check the logbook for hikers we might know. We met Iron Mom and Intrepid while we were there. 
There were several more great views on the day, but the treadway was super rocky, so you had to stop to look around. TheOkie’s friend David did great on the hike today and is going to join us again tomorrow for a bit longer hike. He has the same appreciation for trekking poles that we all have. 
When we popped out at Thornton Gap, TheOkie’s wife and David’s wife were there waiting for us.  We drove back to Jess’ in Luray where TheOkie and I each had three chili dogs for lunch.  I had told him how good mine were yesterday, and he agreed. 
Then it was off to Walmart to buy food for the Air Bnb as well as for the wives to give out trail magic the next few days. After getting to the house and getting cleaned up, we put in laundry and headed to Front Royal to a Mexican restaurant for supper. It was a great day for hiking even if our feet felt it was a bit rocky.","Skyland Resort

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664015,"“While you were waking up today, someone else was taking their last breath. Be thankful for this day. Don't waste it.”  We had a great breakfast of blueberry pancakes and bacon at the Air BnB and then headed back to Skyline drive. It was the coolest morning in a while, but I decided to follow the sage advice I had seen written on a shelter wall in North Carolina:  Be Bold, Dress Cold. I wore my shorts as it was in the upper 40’s and expected to get warmer as the day went on.  We decided to slack south from Hogback Mountain Overlook.  On the way to the trailhead, we noticed a very full parking lot. At the overlook we saw a very unusual truck pulling a trailer-mounted communication tower device. We started on the trail and quickly saw a couple of guys and I waved and spoke. They looked up but didn’t respond. The trail quickly crossed the road. When we went to enter the trail on the other side of the road, there was a big red “trail closed” sign. This was adjacent to the full parking lot. Upon inspection, the parking lot had crime scene tape around it. JFK went over to find someone and see what was going on. We had walked into someone’s search for a missing person who was last seen May 5th heading back to his university. His car had been found in the parking lot by the overlook. As we stood there figuring out our next move, the temperature had dropped to 43° in the cold wind. Luckily I had my rain/wind pants in my slackpack and put them on, which helped a lot. Soon it was apparent that we needed to road walk almost a mile to where the trail crossed the road next. Luckily when we got there, the trail was open and we headed off into the woods. Shortly, we met Mad Dog and stopped to visit with him and then we met Maps, Rock Lizard, and Branch. We made our way to the Elk Wallow wayside just before 11. The store was open, but the restaurant didn’t open until 11. We sat out in the sun eating our snacks and having a drink. At 11, TheOkie went inside for one of their famous blackberry milkshakes. JFK went in and got a chocolate milkshake. I was still cold from earlier standing out in the wind in my shorts, so even though it pained me, I didn’t order a milkshake. Eric From Toronto and All Trails stopped in and joined us at the picnic table for a while. Back on the trail we ran into Bluegrass who confirmed the news that we had been told, there was a dead deer on the trail just ahead. He also said he had arrived at the trail magic that TheOkie’s wife Sharon and David’s wife Sarah were setting up. He really enjoyed visiting with them and appreciated the trail magic. We continued hiking down the mostly rocky trail and at mile 949.2, there it was. A deer right on the trail. It didn’t look like it had suffered any trauma, but it seemed very unusual that it would pass away squarely in the middle of the trail. Soon we arrived at Beahm’s Gap where the ladies had set up their trail magic. When we arrived, Good Soup, 4 Low, and a younger Mad Dog were there visiting and enjoying the variety of snacks. We stayed and had quite the visit with Good Soup and 4 Low, who we hadn’t seen in a while. Eventually we all headed out and finished up the hike. Just before we arrived at Thornton Gap, we met Catorito coming up the trail. We stopped for a bit to visit with her. Once we got to the car, we went to Front Royal for a late lunch and then to Winchester for a choco dipped strawberry Blizzard. I really appreciate David, who has hiked with us these last two days and has been so gracious to drive us all over creation, as well as provide us a nice place to stay indoors. Also, TheOkie had been given some specific ice cream money, which he shared with everyone for our Blizzards. So it was a day of giving and receiving trail magic. Even though the day started in a way I never would have expected on this adventure, we still had a great day. Today’s miles moved that needle to 43%.  The most exciting news of the day is that my wife and daughter flew into DC this afternoon! I will soon get to see them for a couple of zero days of sightseeing in the area and celebrating my daughter’s birthday.","US 211 Thornton Gap

Then it was off to Hogback Mountain Overlook to slackpack north. When we pulled into the overlook, Second Chance was walking by. JFK, TheOkie, David, and I quickly ducked onto the trail and hastily made our way into the woods. It was another cool morning and we were walking in a cloud. Going north, we didn’t see many other hikers. We made really good time on good treadway most of the day. At Compton Gap we stopped for the great trail magic from TheOkie’s & David’s wives. Then two hours later we were pulling into their trail magic again when they had moved it to the Front Royal Lake trail crossing. We had just met three enthusiastic Canadian section hikers that were singing the praises of the trail angels. At the new trail magic setup, we saw Bluegrass, Mulka, Mandalorian, and several others enjoying themselves. Just after we arrived, my daughter, my wife, and my wife’s childhood friend who lives in the area, arrived. It was great to see them and it was also special because it was my daughter’s birthday. At some point the hikers found out it was my daughter’s birthday and Mandalorian, who got his trail name because he hikes with a mandolin, led the group in a rousing rendition of happy birthday. On the way back to my wife’s friend Ann’s house we made a stop by the red truck bakery for cake, ice cream, and a muffin. The cake is the only thing that survived the car ride. After a quick shower we were off again as Ann’s husband Michael drove us to a nice restaurant for dinner. Back at their house we started in on the lemon cake we had bought earlier. So it was another great day of hiking. Today’s miles moved the needle to 44%.  We completed our 105 mile trip through the Shenandoah National Park.

We visited the Washington Monument and then walked the mall to the World War II Memorial. Leaving there, we walked past the reflecting pool to the Lincoln Memorial. Climbing the steps there, we got some great pictures. Next we visited the Vietnam Wall. From there it was off to Pennsylvania Avenue and a look at the White House. Leaving there, we walked past the J Edgar Hoover FBI Headquarters building and then went in the National Archives for a peek at the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Bill of Rights. We convinced JFK that even though Nicholas Cage made it look easy, he really shouldn’t try to switch out the Declaration of Independence with a gift shop copy. After a Shake Shack lunch of big burgers and milkshakes, we walked back to the mall for capitol pictures and a walk through the nearby sculpture garden. We then made a brief stop in the Natural History Smithsonian to see the dinosaurs, giraffes, and Jerboas. Then a short walk to the American History Smithsonian to see the Star Spangled Banner that inspired Francis Scott Key to write our national anthem. We finally hiked back to the metro and took the blue line out to Arlington National Cemetery. We walked through the sobering rows of white headstones until we reached the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. We were able to watch a wreath laying ceremony as well as the changing of the guard. We packed a lot in to our time in DC. I’ve been there numerous times and I always leave there with a deeper sense of pride in our country and a deeper appreciation for our freedoms. In today’s case, ZERO means zero TRAIL miles, definitely not zero miles. I wound up walking 8 miles on my day off.

I also have new shoes after about 450 miles on the last pair. I got dressed in my hiking shorts and shirt since there is no reason to try and keep them clean. By the second mile in the morning, no one will know the difference. We went for a great BBQ lunch at Carolina Brothers, a restaurant owned by friends of Ann and Michael. I had a brisket sandwich that was outstanding and a warm piece of cornbread that was a great dessert. I liked their BBQ sauce so much that I bought two bottles to send home. From there it was off to Harper’s Ferry.  Our first stop was at the ATC Headquarters. We bought a few souvenirs and took an “unofficial” photo in front of the wall where we should have our “official” photos taken in a few days when we walk there.

We also saw the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers and the bridge we will walk across when we leave Harper’s Ferry. David was kind enough to give us a lift back up the hill. Then it was a quick stop into a nearby bakery for a wonderful chocolate dipped macaroon. This made a nice pre-dinner dessert before we stopped in The Anvil restaurant for a good meal with everyone.

Eventually the rocks showed back up, but it was pretty favorable most of the day. The weather was great all day. We stopped to take a picture of Ray’s Rhino.  We passed several streams and springs, but only had to stop at one since the ladies had provided us trail magic at two locations. The road crossing where they picked David up was very exciting as it was a very busy divided 4 lane road. We all made it across safely. Shoelace was at the trail magic also and is camping near the shelter we are staying in. After we loaded all of our items into our pack, we headed into the woods for the final three miles.

It was coiled up and moving side to side while shaking its tail in the leaves to try and make a rattling noise.

The Rollercoaster is a 14 mile section of steep ups and downs on very rocky terrain. By the end of it, our feet were not happy with us. For the first steep up, JFK cranked up Rollercoaster Of Love by The Ohio Players.  It definitely helped power us up the hill, but the hill was longer than the song. We had right at a mile of ascent today and we will remember this section of Virginia. By 9:45 we hit a HUGE milestone, the 1,000 mile mark. It is hard to believe that we have walked 1,000 miles!  Equally hard to believe we aren’t even halfway there yet. We were very excited and stopped for fist bumps and photos at the nice sign, to commemorate the occasion. Then JFK cranked up The Proclaimers’ song about walking 1,000 miles. These events were planned and expected, but at 12:30, the most surprising thing of the day happened. As we walked up on Bears Den Rocks from one direction, Pink Draggin’ walked onto the same overlook from the opposite direction. Since our first day on trail, the universe has kept crossing our paths. Pink was just back from trail days in Damascus last weekend and was with Thumper, Whole Foods, & the Hiking Sailor.  The universe had quite a chuckle today. It was quite the reunion, as Pink doesn’t settle for the traditional fist bump hiker greeting, Pink is a hugger. We last saw him at Standing Bear hostel March 26th although we have seen his name written  on the train tracks north of Daleville since then. But seriously, what are the odds of walking a 2,200 mile trail and intersecting with someone on an exact spot nearly two months later. When we left there, we were still in the ups and downs of The Rollercoaster. All three of us were climbing so hard and looking so intently for places to land our feet between the incessant rocks, that we all missed the Virginia/West Virginia border sign. We knew it was coming up in this stretch, so I stopped to see when it was coming, and we had already passed it. I thought it must just be a small, out of the way sign, so we walked back down a short distance until we saw it. It was a good sized sign mounted on a large post just on the edge of the trail. The fact we all three missed it tells you how much concentration is required to deal with these rocks. When we saw the sign, a choir of hiking angels sang hallelujah. These were the first steps of the trail that we had hiked outside of Virginia since April 12th, over 540 miles ago. Technically, we aren’t quite finished with Virginia yet, as the trail follows the border between the two states briefly. Now don’t get me wrong, we have loved a lot of Virginia, but there is a certain sense of accomplishment when you are knocking out states. We decided to hike into the Blackburn Trail Center for the night. They have a cabin that four thru hikers can stay in as well as tent spots. We were the first hikers to arrive and looked in the cabin. It was nice, but it isn’t supposed to rain tonight, so we opted to set up our tents. As we were having dinner at the picnic table, the caretaker, Amelia, came down to give us information for our stay here. She was a 2020 thru hiker and was super friendly and helpful. She also treated us to trail magic of a soft drink and some cookies. Those really hit the spot after a hard day of hiking.  One of the other treats of staying here is that they have an outdoor solar shower. As she explained, they have more shower than they have solar.  I quickly showered first, and let’s just say that there was no chance I was going to burn myself with the water. But it was wet and did a great job of knocking the salt off and removing what could have been mistaken for a tan on my legs. Today we inched the needle up to 46%. We should have a shorter and easier day tomorrow as we head into Harper’s Ferry for our official ATC pictures.","Rod Hollow Shelter

We really enjoyed the Blackburn Center and had our breakfast on one of their sunny picnic tables while letting the underside of our tents dry out. When we left, it was a very steep uphill climb to rejoin the AT.The trail today was again very rocky. It still amazes me how much recovery we get overnight and although my feet were still sore this morning, they certainly weren’t in the same pain they were when I went to bed. The lower mileage day helped and my feet ended the day much better than yesterday. The weather was again beautiful, but a bit warmer than the last few days. In the cover of the forest it is fine, but hiking in the exposed openings or in town, you really notice the heat. I don’t remember the last time I had a day I didn’t sweat through all of my clothes. At times we hiked through sections of trail lined by enormous growths of Japanese roses that make the trail smell wonderfully fragrant even with us walking through there. Just before noon, we hiked past another West Virginia / Virginia border sign attached to a tree. I THINK that we have now left Virginia for good. Of the  2,537,789 steps I’ve taken since starting the trail, approximately 1,338,994 of them were in Virginia.

We have now walked 1,025 miles and climbed a total of 231,979 feet or 43.93 miles or 7.99 times the height of Mt. Everest. No wonder we feel tired. The final part of todays hike was across the long bridge over the Shenandoah River. We were so thankful to have a very nice pedestrian lane with a full concrete barrier between us and the busy highway traffic. Once in town we climbed up the blue blazed trail to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Headquarters to have our official photo taken and registered into their archives. When I started my hike on February 28th, I was northbound (NOBO) hiker #591. Today I was NOBO hiker #335.  We’ve passed some people, and we’ve been passed by a lot of people, but by this point there are many, many people who have had to give up on their thru hike for one reason or another. The three of us feel very blessed to still be hiking on. They refer to Harper’s Ferry and the ATC HQ as the psychological halfway point. We should hit the actual halfway point within the next week. The ATC volunteer on duty today took our pictures and made sure that we knew hiking the AT was difficult and we should check the weather. Since JFK had lived in New England, she placed him in charge of TheOkie and me. After we looked through the records of this years hikers to see which of our trail friends had already checked in, we headed down the street to the nice little bakery I had found on my reconnaissance trip Sunday. Two cookies, a loaf of bread, and a soda later we walked down past the post office and to the 7-11. This was the best shot of resupplying within Harper’s Ferry and it was lacking. JFK got us an UBER and we headed to nearby Charles Town and a WalMart to resupply for the next 5 days as well as food for supper tonight since there were no options close to our hotel. We finally were able to get an UBER back to Harper’s Ferry where we checked in at the Quality Inn. The lobby was full of hikers and we saw Dex, Mandalorian, and Giulio from Italy there. Then it was time to organize our food, get cleaned up and have dinner. I had a nice chef salad, three ham sandwiches, Ruffles, a macaroon, and a banana.  That was definitely an upgrade from last night’s tuna packets on tortillas.","Blackburn Trail Center

It was the best hotel breakfast we have seen in a while. As we were eating, Dex, Mandalorian, and our new Italian friend all visited with us on their way out. We got packed up, which was challenging with 5 days of food in the top of the pack, and headed out into the cool breeze by 8:00. We climbed the trail up to the top of Harper’s Ferry and then down past historical buildings and informational plaques. When the trail reached the bottom where the Shenandoah River merged into the Potomac River, we climbed the stairs up to the pedestrian bridge adjacent to the railroad bridge. Halfway across the bridge we started a new map section and were in Maryland. For the hundreds of miles we were in Virginia, it seems that West Virginia really got shorted with their handful of miles. The first impression of walking In Maryland was awesome. We walked down a few miles of the 60 mile path that was formerly a tow path for the C&O canal. Eventually we turned off the path, climbed under the bridge of a busy highway, and back into the woods. We climbed and climbed until we reached the short side trail to the Weverton  cliffs.  A large group of teenage girls was just coming back up from the side trail when we arrived. We hiked down to the cliffs where we had views of the river, as well as of a helicopter flying below us. Further down the rocky trail we came to Gathland State Park. We stopped for water and snacks on a bench and used their bathroom facilities. As we were leaving, we passed the War Correspondent’s Memorial which is a large archway structure in the park. Heading back uphill into the woods, we met Willin walking south. Assuming he was slackpacking southbound, we joked with him about going the wrong way. It turns out he was hiking back to town to leave the trail to go help someone through a medical situation. We hate to see him go, as we all enjoyed visiting with him when our paths crossed. We had originally planned to stop at a shelter a couple of miles short of here, but by hiking the additional 1.8 miles we have access to hot showers and flush toilets. An offer too good to pass up. After setting up my tent, I took a nice warm shower and did some shower laundry. It felt good to get the salt knocked off of me and my clothes. I dried pretty quickly, I just hope my clothes dry by morning. The campground is surrounded by beautiful giant trees which is nice, but they really started blocking out the sun hours before sunset. For dinner, we gathered around the picnic table and I had a new meal which I think is my new favorite. Pre-cooked bacon and grape tomatoes wrapped up in tortillas. It all traveled well for 1 day, I’ll see how it does tomorrow. I wasn’t optimistic enough to bring it for more days than that. Today we hiked past a lot of mountain laurel that was in full bloom. It was very pretty and smelled great. Our miles today bumped the needle up to 47%. There are a lot more exciting things coming up in the next few days!","Harper’s Ferry

I shall use my time.” -Jack London It started getting light and the birds started their singing around 5 this morning. The sleeping bag over the head trick worked until about 6:30. I had strung a clothesline up in the top of my tent, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the things I had washed in the nice campground shower, were practically dry. It was 50°, so I put my substantially dry shirt in the warm sleeping bag with me for a few minutes to preheat it before putting it on my body. I got dressed and packed up everything in my tent. Then I joined JFK & TheOkie at the adjacent picnic table for my breakfast of peanut butter crackers and a peanut butter Cliff bar. Once we packed away the tents, we headed out. Before 9, we reached the ORIGINAL Washington Monument which was dedicated in 1827. No one else was there, so we left our packs on a bench and climbed the interior stone staircase to the top. The views from the top were incredible. After we had explored the area and had a snack, we headed back the short distance to the trail.  The trail took us to a pedestrian bridge over the very busy interstate 70. Even with all of the traffic, sadly TheOkie couldn’t coax a semi to honk for him. Our paths in the morning were generally great dirt paths with log terraced steps that seemed to go on forever. We stopped at the black rock cliffs to take in the view of the valley. It was so nice up there that we sat in the sun and had a snack break while we watched the large birds soaring on the thermal updrafts. We hiked across a couple of huge hay meadows that had just recently been cut. I bet the hikers crossing those fields last week were looking at chest high grass. Today on the trail, we met lots of hikers that are hiking from the border of Pennsylvania to the northern border of Virginia over their Memorial Day weekend.We also met two Maryland Ridge Runners, Pre-Pack and Bones. They gave us helpful information about the best place to get water before our shelter tonight. We stopped about a mile before camp and collected water that was barely dripping off of a huge rock slab, ironically called Cascades. It was a steep 400 foot climb that final mile into camp with 6 lbs of water and a full pack, but we will be glad to have it tonight and in the morning since the next water after camp is 6 miles away. As we were setting up our tents on the designated tent pad sites, Maps came by. We had dinner with him at the picnic table in front of the shelter. I had my second night of bacon-grape tomato tortilla wraps. It was amazing and I see many more of them in my future. After brushing my teeth, we hung our bear bags from the provided bear cables. Now it is time for an early bedtime. Our miles today nudged the needle to 48% of the trail. Today was our only full day in Maryland, as we should hit our 7th state before lunch tomorrow. Exciting events keep happening since finishing Virginia.","Dahlgren Backpacker Campground

– Mother TheresaI woke up inside my tent this morning and packed everything inside my backpack except the tent. I thought that might be good practice for a rainy morning. Today, however was perfect weather again. We got out of camp before 8 and made a stop at High Rock Ledges. These ledges offer a great view, but they are also notable for the amount of graffiti spray painted on them. It is like the wilderness version of the Cadillac Ranch west of Amarillo, Texas. If the only access to the ledges is by the steep, rocky trail we came down, I admire the commitment of the vandals. After picking our way down the rock scramble, we made it to Pen-Mar park. We stopped on a bench for a snack, refilled our water, and used their restroom. It is a great park, but we were most excited about what was just across the railroad tracks from it. We reached the sign showing that we were standing at the Mason / Dixon line on the Maryland / Pennsylvania border. Six states down and eight to go!  We later crossed a very busy highway. We had to be patient and wait for a break in traffic both ways. It took a while, but we wanted to be very safe. Next we reached Old Forge Park. The park had a water faucet and bathroom which are nice things, but we found the nicest thing in the comment section on FarOut, our navigation app. 4-Low pointed out that Brother’s Pizza delivers to the park. So, we ordered quite the smorgasbord of pizzas, salads, subs, and drinks. We ate all we wanted and also fed 4 Low, Maps, Professor Sprout, Lighthouse, and Catorito. A wildlife ranger also stopped in the park to check us out. He visited quite a while and wound up eating our last piece of pizza. From there it was a 1 mile waddle up the trail to the Tumbling Run Shelter. We set up our tents and collected water from the spring. I washed my legs off in the very cold creek by our campsite. Then we made our way to the social hub of the site, the picnic table. We visited with all of the hikers from lunch as well as a few section hikers. For supper, I had a sub that I had packed out from our Brother’s Pizza delivery. It was another great day weather-wise as well as lots of food and fun.  It was a shorter day with a big milestone and more milestones coming up in the next couple of days.","Raven Rock Shelter

TheOkie was packed up and walking out before I even woke up. He was wanting to go a bit slower to keep his shin from getting upset with him. JFK and I were out of camp before 7:00 and never saw TheOkie again until we reached camp at the end of the day. The morning started off cool, in the upper 40’s but the immediate 850 feet of climbing in the first 3/4 of a mile REALLY warmed things up. A bit later we were climbing up, over, and through enormous rock scrambles.  At one point, we crossed a road and there was a large bag full of various snacks and a note that it was trail magic for hikers. I had a package of Swedish Fish candies to eat as I hiked. The highlight of the walk was passing through Caledonia State Park. The beautiful, shaded park had abundant picnic tables. Catorito was sitting at one of the tables by the restrooms and water fountain. JFK and I joined her and had our snacks, refilled our water, and threw away our trash. Maps and 4 Low also joined us there. The best and worst thing about the park was smelling all of the aromatic grilling meats surrounding us, but not being able to eat any of them. We eventually hiked on and were immediately met with another huge climb.   A few miles later we passed an incredibly nice looking shelter that had a swinging bench out front and hanging baskets of flowers on the porch. The last few miles before camp, we hit a dream stretch of wide, smooth, pine needle covered trail. It is the stuff we are usually just daydreaming about while we are pounding our feet into the rocks. The long miles today gave me plenty of opportunities to remember just how blessed I am to be out here doing this. The beauty that we see daily, from the mountains to the blooming mountain laurels, are just amazing. At camp, we set up our tents. We probably would have anyway, but there were comments in the FarOut app indicating that the shelter here has bedbugs. So the entire group we have been hiking around lately decided we were definitely tenting. We gathered our water from the crystal clear spring near our campsite, then went to the picnic table to eat supper and visit. The big topic of discussion was ice cream tomorrow.  Today’s miles pushed that imaginary needle to 49.81%, so close to halfway that you can’t even see any space between the needle and the 50!  Today JFK and I celebrate 3 months on the trail, even if TheOkie delays his celebration a few days. We have covered a lot of ground in that time, faced enormous obstacles, and made a lifetime of memories. Tomorrow will be a day that is short on miles, but big on milestones!","Tumbling Run Shelter

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664708,"“Do I regret it?  Yes.  Would I do it again?  Probably.” -Nick Miller An INCREDIBLY loud whippoorwill was even more excited than we were, about us waking up early on ice cream day. And we were all very excited. We didn’t eat much breakfast since we didn’t want to spoil the most important meal of the day. So we packed up quickly and were hiking before 7:00. There wasn’t much up or down today and most of the treadway was good. It was a short day with ideal weather and there was talk of this being the easiest day we could remember. About 2 miles in, we hit our first “halfway” sign, only it was for last year’s distance. Since the AT re-routes little sections each year for various reasons, the mileage varies from year to year. Four miles into our day, we hit what we were looking for, 1,099.2 written in stones. The ACTUAL halfway point for this year’s 2,198.4 mile journey.   There were fist bumps and photos to commemorate the feat, but we were far from through with our celebrations.  For the first time, each step we took on the trail was closer to the endpoint of Mt. Katahdin than it was to the starting point of Springer Mountain. That seemed exciting to us, as did the fact that we had 1,099.2 miles to walk and we know that we can walk 1,099.2 miles because we have done it!  The next huge milestone was only a short distance down the trail when we hit the 1,100 mile mark. Another round of fist bumps and more pictures. Later we crossed ANOTHER halfway sign from a year when the trail length was 2,181 miles. This tall wooden sign with American flags in each side is a bit more iconic, it’s just in the wrong spot and has the wrong numbers on it for this year. We passed another really nice shelter area that had Adirondack chairs around a fire pit located near a stream. Honestly, as we hiked, we were mostly focused on reaching Pine Grove Furnace and its general store which is the home of the half gallon challenge. The tradition is for thru hikers to eat a half gallon of ice cream to celebrate reaching the halfway point of the trail. This is a great tradition, but for me, I thought it was a really bad decision since I take lactase tablets when I eat dairy and I have NEVER consumed a half gallon of dairy. When we all arrived, we went in to the ice cream case and selected our flavors. There was a pretty good selection of the 3 pint containers, but a more limited selection of the 1 pint containers and you have to eat both to finish your half gallon and win the coveted prize. I chose orange sherbet for my big container since it would have less dairy in it, but that wasn’t an option for the smaller container. I chose full dairy strawberry for my single pint. I went with the strategy of 2 lactase tablets to start and an additional tablet each 15 minutes. I surprisingly never really found instructions on how much to take if you’re eating an entire half gallon of ice cream.  TheOkie was very gracious and bought everyone’s ice cream for them which was a nice surprise. We pulled up chairs and all gathered around a table on the porch outside the store. We hit the timer and began to dig in. That Okie boy sure can eat some ice cream!  He was tearing through his and finished in 26 minutes.  The only person faster was 8 Lives who went back in the store and bought a carton of milk to stir into his ice cream to make it more like a shake. Maps finished his, and then I finished mine in 39 minutes. I actually felt surprisingly good other than the roof of my mouth which is still numb from what I assume is a mild case of frostbite. 4 Low soon finished hers, although I think she regretted choosing the super sweet birthday cake flavor for her final pint. That just left Catorito, who couldn’t weigh 100 pounds if she was soaking wet and full of ice cream.  She ate a lot of her large container of raspberry ice cream before she started looking a bit purple herself. She had to take a minute as we all watched to see if she was going to be all right. Eventually she grabbed the spoon and powered through the rest of the 3 pint container like a champ. She regrettably threw in the towel and didn’t open the final pint. But as a percentage of body weight, I think she did a great job. After lots of laughs and a lot of stares from the non-hiking public at the store, TheOkie and I decided the half gallon of ice cream didn’t fill us up. So we went back in and I had a delicious California burger and fries to go with my most important meal of the day. JFK’s friend, Johnny Bravo drove in from Ohio to spend a few days walking with us. They had burgers and a bit of ice cream as we all visited. Most of us walked across the parking lot to the AT museum which has a collection of neat AT artifacts such as gear that Grandma Gatewood carried on her thru hike as well as lots of photos and information. When we left there, it was a bit sad. With the nature of the trail, we may not see some of those hikers we’ve been around and sharing laughs with, for weeks, months, or possibly ever again. We will be doing some non-standard mileage these next few days and have several days off trail in June, so as much as the three of us have enjoyed being around these hikers lately, the reality is we will probably be around a different fun group of people for a while. But we’ll all have the memories of sharing our half gallon challenge together. And the universe has a funny way of crossing people’s paths on this crazy trail. As of now we are in a hotel, showering, and doing laundry. I picked out today’s quote ahead of time because I was prepared for the worst with the dairy situation. It turned out great, so I actually didn’t regret it, but even if it hadn’t turned out so well, I absolutely would share this day with those same people again!  As you probably already guessed, todays short miles pushed the imaginary needle over the magical 50% mark!  In bigger news of the day, as winners of the half gallon challenge, TheOkie and I are now proud owners of tiny little wooden ice cream spoons that attest to our membership in the Half Gallon Club!","Birch Run Shelter

We wanted to be on trail as early as possible so we could knock out our 10 miles and head over to Gettysburg for the afternoon. The trail goes about 15 miles from the battlefield, and none of us had ever been there, so we felt it was a great opportunity to learn a bit more about our country’s history. We employed the “key swap” method on the hike today. Johnny Bravo and JFK dropped TheOkie and me off at the north end of our hike and we slackpacked south. Then they drove back to the Pine Grove Furnace Store, where we ended yesterday’s hike, and they parked the car and slackpacked north. When we met in the middle of the hike, they gave the keys to TheOkie so that when we reached the car we could drive back to the north end of our hike and pick them up. It worked perfectly. Our hike started with the biggest uphill we had in a relatively flat hike. We had nice treadway and grade for the biggest part of the day.  We met JFK  and Johnny Bravo before we met any of the other hikers we knew. Eventually we came across Catorito, 4 Low, Maps, and Serotonin. With the light packs, we made pretty good time. The weather was ideal in the shady forest, and the mountain laurels continued to be in peak bloom. As we hit the Pine Grove Furnace State Park, we walked beside a beautiful lake with a sandy beach. A sign said that years ago it had been a 90 foot deep quarry. We also walked past the actual historic iron furnace that the park is named for. It was interesting reading about the way things operated back in those days. We eventually made our way to the general store parking lot where the car was. From the distance we heard our names and saw someone running towards us. We could tell by the voice that it was Bambi!  He ran up and gave us a big hug. It was quite the reunion since we hadn’t seen our long lost friend since April 5th, over 700 miles ago. Our wives had seen him when they were doing trail magic April 20th and we thought we would run into him around then. We would always check the shelter logs to see if he was ahead of us, but we never saw him. But today, the universe crossed our paths. He was actually in the middle of his half gallon challenge when he noticed us walking by. As much as we wanted to visit more and catch up on the missing time, we knew that we had 2 hikers at the edge of the woods waiting on their ride. So we quickly drove to meet JFK & Johnny Bravo. We made the short drive from Carlisle to Gettysburg where JFK had secured tickets for us to watch their film and diorama, tour the museum, and take the guided battlefield bus tour. It exceeded our expectations. In fact the museum was so good that TheOkie and I nearly got left for the bus tour. When we saw that JFK had texted that it was time to go, we went to the wrong bus area. By the time we figured things out, we had to halfway jog to the right area and only made it with a minute to spare.   On the bright side, we got the front row seats for the tour. The tour guide was very knowledgeable, and seeing the places as he described the three day battle really put the size of the battle in perspective. It was a tragic loss of so many young lives. As we’ve walked the trail over the mountains and through the towns near sites of many battles, you can’t help but think about the war every time you see an old stone fence or historic structure. After our tour, we stopped in Gettysburg for dinner, and then as luck would have it, a choco dipped strawberry Blizzard since there was a Dairy Queen a mile away. My mouth is painfully sore today from what I assume is frostbite from eating the half gallon of ice cream so quickly. But when you get bucked off a horse, you’ve got to get right back up there and I guess it’s the same thing with ice cream.","Pine Grove Furnace Store

It still hurt the roof of my mouth and gums. We were changing hotels to one farther up the trail, so we had to put everything we weren’t slackpacking, into our nylafume bags to store in the car for the day.  We did the “key swap” again today with Johnny Bravo’s car. It worked great. They dropped TheOkie and me where we started yesterday, but we walked north. We met them in Boiling Springs and got the keys on our way to Carlisle where they had parked the car and started walking south. Our walk today was mostly through the Cumberland Valley which covered a lot of flat walking in and near wheat fields. I’m guessing this may be the flattest hike of the entire trail after the first three miles. During those first  miles, we climbed a short distance through the blooming mountain laurels and came to a wonderful rock maze of giant boulders that the trail went over, under, and through. It was quite fun. Probably more fun since we were carrying lighter packs than usual. The day warmed up into the 80’s, but the trail kept tucking us back into narrow passages of shaded woods, which was very nice. Early on we came up on Hop who walked with us the rest of the day. It was great to have a new hiker to visit with and find out about them. We compared a lot of trail experiences and the conversation made the miles pass quickly. Shortly after meeting Hop, we came across Chance hiking southbound. We had met him at Wood’s Hole hostel but had not seen him on trail. He is doing something very unique. He has a car and a bicycle. He drops off his bicycle then drives 120 miles north. Hikes south to his bicycle, then rides it back up to his car and repeats the process. He was super helpful with trail information about where we were heading. He also is just an infectiously positive person that is fun to spend time around. This section didn’t have great water sources, so he told us about a spigot on the back of the condemned ATC building in Boiling Springs. We got there and everything was just as he said. While getting our water, we saw JFK & Johnny Bravo across the road visiting with Bambi. We got our water and then went over to visit with them under the shade of a tree on the post office lawn. Eventually we had to move on for the last 8 miles of the day. When we reached the side trail down from the AT to where we are staying tonight, Hop’s husband was there in their pro master camper van RV. He gave us each an ice cold Gatorade that really hit the spot after a long, hot hike. Then he offered to drive us the half mile to get the car. Since those are off-trail miles that don’t count, he didn’t have to ask twice!  We really appreciated his kindness. We drove down to pick up JFK & Johnny Bravo, then went back to the new hotel. For dinner we went to a nice restaurant and sat outside, not because they knew we were thru hikers and expected us to stink, but because it was so nice out. I looked for the softest thing on the menu and had the spaghetti. My mouth fared pretty good, although it tore the skin on a few more blisters. We stopped by a store for a light resupply and I got a few applesauce and banana squeeze snacks. Surely those will be soft enough and I hope to be back to eating everything in a couple of days. I did a little sink laundry to knock the salt off of some of my clothes. It is supposed to break 90° the next 2 days, so the salt will return pretty quickly. The miles today pushed the needle to 51% of the trail completed. It was an easy path, and didn’t have the best views, but it had great conversation, fun with new and old friends, and moved us that much closer to Katahdin.

I lucked out and had a nice bowl of oatmeal. I visited with Campfire, who is a thru hiker we had not met before because he started mid April and is doing huge miles. We also visited with our old friend Good Soup. I had mistakenly bought a couple of jalapeño beef sticks which would currently light up my mouth and he was kind enough to take them off my hands. I went back to the room and had one of the GoGo Squeeze pouches of apple-banana fruit on the go, which is totally not baby food, that I picked up at the store last night. By 8:05, we were walking back up the road to the trail. By 8:30, we were stopping in to the little Mennonite farm store, the Trail View Market, where they sell raw milk, eggs, ice cream and Gatorade. We really didn’t need anything that early, but when you pass something like that on the trail, you just have to support it. We grabbed cold Gatorades out of the case and Johnny Bravo left our money in their honor system box full of money. We had some more farm field walking and then walked a boardwalk next to a river. We walked through a nice rock tunnel under a highway and then began a climb. And what a climb it was, probably 700 feet of elevation gain that felt straight up after a couple of days of pasture walks. It gave us our first Mountain View we’ve had in a few days, and then dumped us out into more fields. These fields were beautiful, rolling fields of purple flowers. Looking it up, we discovered it was vetch. I had been texting with my mother who was concerned about me losing weight if I can’t load up on calories because of my mouth and letting me know she was praying for me. JFK was looking at FarOut and said just ahead there was a parking area big enough for four cars, it would be a great place for trail magic. As we got closer, there was a sign pointing to snacks and drinks! There was a mowed path from the trail to the parking area. It led to three ice chests full of goodies. I had an ice cold Powerade and two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on the softest white bread ever. It was no coincidence that it was just what I needed. We’ve talked a bit the last few days about trail magic. Strangely, it is controversial because there are much needier people than thru hikers going hungry in the world. While that is absolutely true, there is a lot of joy in trail magic for both the giver and the recipient. It really blessed us that an anonymous person wanted to show hospitality to strangers with no expectations of anything in return. I know that when our wives have been out to do trail magic, they have been just as excited to treat someone who they know is so genuinely appreciative, no matter how small the treat. After getting back on the trail, we walked through more fields with a  lovely purple hue until the trail took us up into the forest for good. As we climbed to the ridge line, the ground became rockier and rockier until you just stepped from rock to rock. Around 2:00 we reached the side trail for our shelter and went quite a way down a steep trail to get to it. One claim to fame of the Cove Mountain Shelter is that porcupines have been trying to eat the shelter and any salty hiker gear they can reach. Maintainers eventually took away the steps to get up into the shelter and have added a foot of metal flashing all the way around the bottom of the shelter to discourage the porcupines. It is also a unique shelter in that it has two sets of built in bunks. On this 90° day, I’m opting to sleep on the floor where I think it will be cooler than an upper bunk. I made the trip down the long steep side trail to the spring and got water. I only want to make that trip once. For supper I had tuna packets in flour tortillas and a GoGo Squeeze fruit packet. It’s definitely in the soft category, but still painful. I’m sure it will be better soon, but I do have to keep eating in the meantime.

We left before him, but I choose to think he made sure it was stone cold out before he headed south to finish his section hike. We hiked down into the town of Duncannon, stopping at Hawk Rock to take in the views. As we hit town, we stopped at the 7-Eleven and got a big Gatorade. I also got a jar of peanut butter for the next couple of days. We then stopped into Kinda Outdoorsy, a hostel with a hiker lounge and resupply items. Johnny Bravo got a quick $5 shower before catching his shuttle back to his car for his long drive home. We said our goodbyes and then walked to the historic Doyle Hotel.

I was thrilled to be able to eat all of my food by chewing on my right side, which is already much better. When we left the Doyle, we had a long very warm walk through town. At the end of town, we crossed two long bridges and a railroad track before heading up into the woods. When I say up into the woods, I mean UP into the woods! What a climb on this 90° day. In the shade, at times the temperature dropped into the high 80’s and any breeze on our sweat soaked bodies felt heavenly. Walking across the exposed rock slab outcroppings, the temperature would spike but we never stayed out there long enough to see just high it would get. I don’t know if I was just wilting in the heat or bonked from nutrition, but the hot climbs took their toll on me. JFK and I stopped at a shelter and he took our water bags down and filled them up. After a liter and a half of cold spring water and a few honey stingers, I was able to shuffle back up the trail. JFK followed me to make sure I was doing ok. We got a text from TheOkie to let us know that there was trail magic a mile ahead if we hurried. I hurried the best I could and we made it.  Lenny, known as Twizzler was there and we were sure glad to see him. After an ice cold Mountain Dew and a handful of Twizzlers, I felt like I had a new bit of life in me. TheOkie, JFK, Maps, and I covered the last three miles to the shelter at a pretty good pace. A pace that I don’t think I could have kept up on my own. When we arrived at the shelter, there was quite the crowd there including 4 Low and Catorito. The next order of business was to make the longest downhill trip to get water we have ever had to make. The nice spring for this shelter was about 550 steps down a steep hill from the shelter. I’m talking 25% grade of steep stairs. After filtering and drinking water, I gathered more water for tomorrow and then washed off a bit with a bandanna in the  cold spring water. Normally that seems too cold, but definitely not today. At dinner I had peanut butter on tortillas and that worked well. The large group in the shelter had a lot of fun telling stories until after hiker midnight, 8:00. So now it’s bedtime and time to be thankful for my friends that helped me through a challenging day.","Cove Mountain Shelter

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664966,"“When you're out of willpower you call on stubbornness, that's the trick.” - Henri MatisseLast night after I posted my journal, I went out one last time to the bathroom. As I was walking back to the shelter I heard a rustle in the underbrush. I looked and saw a porcupine waddling around the camp.  It wasn’t eating on the shelter, or anything, just lumbering along.  I took a quick picture and then got JFK, so he’s could see it. We were pretty packed in the shelter and it was still quite warm in the upper deck last night. The shelter came alive at 5:00, intentionally on someone’s part, and not because of our friendly whippoorwill that likes to visit the shelters early in the morning. I just had peanut butter for breakfast today, which felt fine and we were on the trail by 7:00. Today was much better hiking weather than yesterday as we topped out at 75° this afternoon.  There were some very long uphill climbs but thankfully they weren’t very steep. There were plenty of rocks, but they weren’t terrible all day.  My energy level stayed up today, so that was nice.  I hiked fast as I was racing the threat of rain to the shelter.  I did beat the rain by quite a while. When I got there, I was soaked with sweat, it was still warm and the water source was about 10 steps in front of the shelter. I quickly washed the salt off of me with a bandanna and then washed out some salty clothes. We had an early dinner and hung our bear bags. The shelter has a capacity of 6 and Maps, Catorito, 4 Low, TheOkie, JFK, and I were packed in shoulder to shoulder. Before 7 we were tucked in when a former thru hiker and his 4 year old son brought us chocolate bars for trail magic. As of now we are listening to a huge thunderstorm and having great conversation about our trail experiences. Glad to be inside and dry and not having to pack up a wet tent in the morning. I saw a few very bizarre things in the trail today. On two occasions miles apart, I found a leaf thumbtacked to a tree. I applaud the person who went to the trouble to do this. Most people would just look at all the leaves on the ground, separated from their trees and think they couldn’t make a difference by reattaching them all and give up. But this random person knew they could make a difference to those two leaves and chose to act, much like the person returning starfish to the sea. I also found a piece of paper on the trail, I picked it up and it was chock full of conspiracy theories. It even had the name JFK on it, so I tried to give it to him, but he declined. We also kept hearing gunfire and explosions from a nearby military training exercise. Kept things interesting!  Today’s miles pushed the needle to 53%.  I’m a bit sore and my feet hurt, but that stubbornness will have me back on the trail for another big day tomorrow.","Peter’s Mountain Shelter

We were treated to a thunderstorm and cooler temperatures in the shelter last night. We woke up around 5:30 and started getting ready for the day. 
Last night I strung a clothesline up in the shelter for the clothes I had washed. As I grabbed the clothes this morning I came to the realization that things don’t fully dry in 121% humidity. I went ahead and put my damp wool tshirt on and put a light fleece on over it. I opted to put a dry pair of underwear on, instead of the damp pair. You see, that’s one of the two reasons you should take an extra pair of underwear on the AT. The other reason is if you unexpectedly stumble upon a bear. 
I had given Maps the chocolate bar from the nice kid doing trail magic last night, so he could put it in his bear bag, as mine was already hung.  He gave me the chocolate back at breakfast and I was able to recreate the old Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup commercials by getting peanut butter on my chocolate. It was a good way to eat a lot of peanut butter for breakfast and obviously there are very few dietary rules on the trail. 
One of the rigid dietary rules on the trail is that if pizza delivery is available on trail, you MUST partake in it.  This is important because the 501 shelter where we are staying tonight, is our third opportunity on trail for pizza delivery. 
After breakfast we were hiking by 7:00. With last night’s rain, our little orange spotted salamander friends were out in force this morning. I bet we saw more than 50 of them, starting right outside the shelter area. 
Before 7:30, we had reached the area that the FarOut app had warned us about, the 150 foot section of trail that is flooded due to beavers damming up the creek. We crossed in a group, carefully stepping from log to log and branch to branch. It was a bit tricky as some logs were partially submerged and others were unstable “rollers”.  The trekking poles really helped keep your balance as you tentatively placed your weight on the next log. The water wasn’t super deep in most places, but I wasn’t sure how deep the muck was and I didn’t want to find out. We all successfully made it across to dry trail with only a few wet toes to show for it. 
Once across, the trail took us up, up, up to the ridge line for most of the day. There were patches of bad rock and patches of horrible rock, but lot’s of reasonable areas in between. 
About four miles from our shelter, we stopped at a side trail to get water. We are definitely spoiled to the cold clean spring water. It felt great to down a couple of liters. As we sat in the shade afterwards, I actually got chilled on the 72° day. Once we started hiking out, the chill was quickly gone. 
At the shelter, we were very excited about the prospect of pizza since we had been talking about it for days. We got our order in and it was a big one. When deprived of such things, your eyes are bigger than your stomach, even if your stomach can eat a half a gallon of ice cream. We will now have to eat second dinner, breakfast, and carry some out for lunch tomorrow. A new thru hiker, Nero showed up and was glad to take some of it off our hands. 
The shelter is quite unique as it is fully enclosed, has 12 bunks, and a giant octagonal skylight. There is a full sized picnic table in the middle of it, which made a nice place for the pizza feast and visiting. 
It was another beautiful day outside. Our mileage today bumps the needle to 54% of the trail.  We are experiencing more and more rocks, but hear the REAL rocks are ahead of us. The whole journey has been one of challenges, so that’s just the next one.","Rausch Gap Shelter

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665044,"“Hiking was the answer – can’t remember what the question was.”


People may have been awake in the shelter at 5:00 this morning, but after the stern warning yesterday, no one dared to get out of their bunk until around 7:00. For breakfast, I ate half of my sub that I ordered from the pizza place last night. It was a little soggy, but quite tasty. We had a couple of milestones on today’s hike. The first one was only two miles in when we passed the point that we have less than 1,000 miles to go to reach Mt. Katahdin.  It is hard for us to realize that the countdown to the end is now in the triple digits. The next big milestone was just 3.6 miles into our hike when we hit the 1,200 mile mark!  We had fist bumps and photos all around to celebrate.  Then a few yards later, there was another 1,200 mile mark, so more photos. We were not shocked that the material of choice to make both of the 1,200’s was rock. If there is one thing Pennsylvania is known for on the trail, it is rocks. Although we haven’t reached the iconic bad rock areas yet, today’s trail did a good imitation. It gave us the trail packed with pointy little rocks as well as the trail blended into the hillside consisting only of large rock slabs. We stopped at one of the few good water sources on trail today. While filtering and drinking water, I also ate the other half of my sub. Real food for lunch is a treat we don’t often take advantage of on trail. Downstream from where we collected water was a beautiful swimming hole. The comments on FarOut didn’t do it justice. The creek had an actual dam across it and there were rope swings out over it. It was only 66° out, but it looked like a great place to end a day when the temperatures are in the 90’s like a few days ago. Late in the day we went through an area that had experienced a prescribed burn. Unfortunately rocks don’t burn and there were plenty of them. We eventually made it into camp which is a really nice looking three sided log cabin structure. The water source here is a pretty small flow. We scooped the water up in a cup and used that to fill our water filter bags. For dinner, the six of us that have been traveling near each other gathered at the picnic table. Now that I can chew and eat anything again, I had spam with chili cheese Fritos on tortillas. I also caught up on some of the granola bars that I had been carrying but not eating. I no longer take chewing hard foods for granted. It was another beautiful day with comfortable temperatures. In fact at dinner, we were wearing our coats. Todays miles jumped the needle to 55% completed.  We love knocking out those 100 mile marks, so hitting 1,200 miles today made us all very happy.","501 Shelter

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665108,"“Don’t pray when it rains if you don’t pray when the sun shines.” -Satchel PaigeofThe Eagle’s Nest Shelter was a really classic log cabin looking shelter, but it was very dark inside. That made for good sleeping, so we slept in until after 6:00. We hiked out through some beautiful fern covered forests and then it was into the rocks. The trail also threw in an enormous “straight up to the top” climb for good measure. As we reached the edge of Port Clinton, the trail took us straight down a rocky ravine. I would guess that both the steep ascent and steep descent were in the neighborhood  of a 30° slope. Once we came back to earth at Port Clinton, the trail dumped us into a train yard. There were several sets of tracks to cross and some of the tracks had vintage passenger train cars on them.  Next to the tracks were some car sized chunks of the “Famous Reading Anthracite”.  We walked into town and asked a group of grade school kids on bicycles where we might get something cold to drink. They immediately pointed us to the river we had just walked across. I guess we just have that look. We eventually communicated that we were looking for something with flavor. They pointed us in the direction of the local candy store. While JFK waited for our other hikers and a shuttle driver to arrive, Ozzy the German and I walked the few blocks to the candy store. When we opened the door, it was unbelievable. The place was packed with rooms of all types of candies and nuts. The fact that this store exists in a town so small that BOTH of the restaurants are closed on Monday and Tuesday is surprising. I grabbed a Gatorade, some Zots, and a bag of carmel corn and headed back. Ozzy had left his trekking poles there, so I returned them to him. The shuttle driver that JFK found took us all to Walmart in the next town in two groups. The charge for taking four stinky hikers and their backpacks was $5 for the carload. That seemed super reasonable. We resupplied food for the next few days and ate a foot long sub from their Subway and a Nathan dog from their deli. Then we were shuttled back to Port Clinton and headed back into the woods. If you’ve been following this blog, you can probably guess what is next after you do a steep descent into a town. If you guessed that we had a steep climb out of town, you are correct. Once JFK and I got up to the ridge line high above Port Clinton, we started hearing thunder and seeing a large dark cloud approaching. We started going faster trying to get off the top of the ridge, but the trail kept rising. As we were practically running on the rocks, racing the storm, the rains hit us while still a quarter mile from where the trail would turn and take us down to relative safety. We stopped quickly to put on our rain jackets and JFK suggested we put some distance between us, just in case. The lightning never got super close and twenty minutes later, the storm had passed over. If there is one thing that will make you forget the painful rocks under your feet, it is lightning over your head. If you’ve followed this journal from the beginning, you know that lightning was my number one fear heading to the trail. I did a lot of praying through the storm!  But as the quote above indicates, that’s ok, because I find a lot of time to pray on the trail on all of the days, regardless of the weather. We finally made it to the shelter and got set up inside. For dinner, I had a bacon, tomato, mayo tortilla wrap courtesy of today’s resupply. It was another good, exhilarating day on the AT.  Tomorrow it looks like our little hiking group will go our separate ways until the universe brings us back together. The three of us will be preparing to travel and have a couple of days off trail. Maps, Catorito, and 4 Low are heading on ahead to the hostel we will be hitting the following day. It has been a blast sharing the trail with them and hopefully our paths will continue to cross up trail.","Eagle’s Nest Shelter

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665162,"“Your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire.” - Sanford Townsend BandYesterday evening the smoke from the Canadian wildfires started showing up.  By this morning it was here in full force. The smell of smoke was constant and where the sun’s rays penetrated the forest canopy it came through in amber. We had four named viewspots on today’s hike including Pulpit Rock and The Pinnacle.  Earlier in the day while there was still any view, it was a dim monochromatic one.  By the afternoon, you honestly couldn’t tell what the view was supposed to be of. We all kind of feel like we smoked a pack of Canadian Wildfire unfiltereds today. Right out of camp this morning, the climbing started. We climbed to the first view spot, Pulpit Rock. Right away we knew that the views weren’t going to be stellar today. Across the trail though, we saw the property of the Lehigh Valley Amateur Astronomical Society. There were three very large domed telescope facilities there. That was quite interesting. Moving on, we came to The Pinnacle. While the views weren’t clear, there was a very large 10 foot tall pyramid shaped pile of rocks at the top. I have no idea where they got that many rocks. Maybe they just hadn’t sprinkled them on the trail yet. We have about 50 more miles of Pennsylvania left and we hear that we aren’t to the rockiest part, yet. We walked on rocks for literally hours today.   The biggest ones aren’t that bad, it’s the smaller pointy ones that you can’t land a whole foot on, that do the damage. TheOkie, JFK, & I walked together most of the day. When we got to the shelter we went down about 550 paces to a piped spring. It was not even dripping from the pipe, but we were able to scoop water from a small puddle and fill our filter bags. For dinner, it was bacon and tomato wraps again. Still great!  I then ate all of my snacks that I didn’t eat earlier today because I feared tripping on a rock if I wasn’t totally focused. Now it’s time for bed along with Ozzy and a new hiker, Pedals in the shelter tonight. One Hundred days into this journey doesn’t seem possible!  The days are hard, but the adventure is grand!  Today’s miles moved the needle up to 56%.

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665212,"“Don't spend your whole life waiting to start living.”Knowing we had a short day today, we slept in to a decadent 6:45. When our eyes opened, the Canadian wildfire smoke was still with us. It didn’t seem any worse than yesterday, but it was still there. We had seen news articles last night saying that breathing the smoky air was the equivalent of smoking a cigarette an hour. So we all got up this morning having smoked another half a pack of Canadian Wildfire unfiltereds through the night. I don’t think you have to worry about any of us getting addicted though. We were quite leisurely packing up and eating breakfast. We said goodbye to Ozzy our German friend that we probably won’t see again since our time off trail will put us behind him and he will be returning to Germany after another 150 miles or so. We did meet Piper, who joined the shelter after we were all fast asleep last night. The treadway leaving the shelter was GREATLY improved over what we had walked the last few days. At one point, we were walking an actual dirt path when we saw a fence of neatly stacked rocks sitting off to the side. I suggested to JFK and TheOkie that those were probably a recent delivery of rocks that they just hadn’t had time to destroy the trail with, yet. We covered the ground pretty quickly this morning and there weren’t many items of note in the hike. We did see the 2,000 km point spelled out in stones beside the trail even though we weren’t looking for it. That alone should prove how much better the trail was. We reached The Lookout hostel just before 10:00 and were met at the door by 4 Low, Maps, and Catorito. 4 Low was wearing a mask over her mouth and nose to combat the smoke as she was hiking out. Maps was getting ready to hike on, and Catorito had decided to zero at the hostel and hope for improving air quality. We quickly found loaner clothes and gathered all of our dirty clothes to start laundry. Then we took showers, luxurious showers. I’m not sure if it was so great because it had been about a week since our last real shower, the fact that they had unlimited actual hot water, or the oversized rain showerhead directly over you, but it was great. While waiting for clothes to dry, we charged electronics, resupplied from the hostel’s food selection, and prepared our backpacks for a few days of storage. I wound up taking a very small bag containing a few clothes, a charger, a toothbrush, and just a few other small things with me. Our 1:00 shuttle was there a bit early and we were off to Allentown for the night. JFK will catch a super early shuttle to the airport for his flight to a wedding in Montana and TheOkie and I will catch an early shuttle to the Amtrak station to catch a bus to a train to New York City to meet my wife for the weekend. Once checked into the hotel in Allentown, we walked across the parking lot to Red Robin for lunch. A few hours later we Ubered to the restaurant of choice for this journey:  Texas Roadhouse. We had a great meal with great service. The best part was that they brought us more rolls than the three of us could eat, and that’s a lot. Now it’s time for bed before early shuttles in the morning. Within the next week, we will all have gotten to visit our wives and that is super exciting!","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter

There was a bit of confusion for our driver as apparently there are busses to New York City that leave from the airport, just not our bus. Our bus was the first leg of our Amtrak train ride in to New York City. We weren’t so much at a bus terminal as we were at a downtown bus stop.  Once we all figured this out, he quickly rerouted and we still arrived with time to spare. When the bus arrived at the Philadelphia train station, we got off and entered the cavernous building. It was very impressive with enormous columns, decorative ceilings, carved stone artwork in the walls and a giant 39 foot tall World War II monument anchoring one end of the building. Once they posted the gate and track information we got in line and waited for the train to arrive. When the Vermonter 56 train arrived, we could see through the windows that it was pretty full. Luckily several people got off in Philadelphia and we were able to get two seats together, although they were next to a solid wall and not a window. As we pulled out of the station, I could see through the window in front of us. My first thought was that I wished I was the paint salesman for the Amtrak corridor. It seemed that everything we passed was either broken down or boarded up, and all of it was painted. The graffiti was quite impressive actually to someone like me who can’t even draw a straight line. When our train reached New York City, it pulled in to the lower level of a subway station. When we exited the station it was automatically sensory overload. TheOkie and I walked the half mile of chaos to our hotel located on Times Square. There were a lot of sights and lights to see in that half mile. My wife had landed in New York about the same time we arrived and the timing was perfect when we all reached the hotel. After checking in, we walked to Junior’s where we had an excellent lunch topped off with a huge ice cream sundae. Then we hit the streets again. First to Rockefeller plaza and then walking down 5th Avenue and stopping in St. Patrick’s Cathedral. Then past Tiffany’s and all of the shops on the way to Central Park. We strolled through the park and found the Balto statue. Then we walked back through the craziness to our hotel. After a brief rest, we were out the door again. This time at JFK’s previous suggestion we got dinner of chicken and rice from a halal street cart. We sat in Times Square and ate while watching the street performers. Then we had a short walk to the Broadhurst Theater to take in the Broadway show, A Beautiful Noise. It was phenomenal!  Finally a walk back through Time’s Square at peak late night craziness to the hotel. Once safely in the hotel, we got a table at the big window that looks directly down on Time’s Square and had a snack while we watched the thousands of people in the crowd below. Today was about as big of a contrast as you could have to a day on the trail!","Allentown

We took the subway to the south end of the island where we hit a nice little deli for breakfast. Then we made it to the ferry terminal just before boarding took place. Once on the ferry, we sailed past the Statue of Liberty. We sat on the wrong side of the boat to get the best views on the way over. We corrected that on the trip back and were treated to great views of Lady Liberty. When we had returned, we stopped by a hotdog cart for a quick Nathan dog. From there we walked to the 9/11 memorial and the Wall Street Bull statue. At this point we decided to take the hop on bus to sightsee a while. It was nice to sit back and listen to the history of so many iconic sights. When we arrived back at the stop by our hotel, we hopped off and walked over to Times Square. There was a Christian concert going on in the square with a large crowd gathered. We also spent this time to secure tickets to another Broadway show for the evening. Finally I bought a container of sliced mango that I had been eyeing and we went up to the room for a short break. When we came back down, we hopped back on the bus to continue the tour loop. Once we finished the tour, we walked back down to Little Italy and started looking for a restaurant for dinner. We saw three police officers walking down the street, so we asked them which place they would recommend. Turns out they were visiting from Coney Island and didn’t know any of the restaurants. We selected a place that makes their own pasta from scratch, Zia Maria. The portions were huge, but I managed to make a happy plate. Then after we had paid our check, the manager said to wait and he had a treat for us. They brought us a plate full of tiramisu and pistachio ice cream!  Maybe we just looked like hungry hikers. After a short walk past the Museum of Ice Cream, we caught the subway back to the hotel to change clothes and then we were off again. We walked the few blocks to the Neil Simon theater to watch the musical MJ. It has some incredible singing and dancing. Afterwards we braved the crowded sidewalks back to Times Square and entered the calm of our hotel. We took up a spot at the table overlooking the chaos below. We people watched until a rain shower moved in and the crowd rapidly dispersed. TheOkie and I agreed that there were more people packed into Times Square than we will see in the next three months on the trail. I have really enjoyed getting to see my wife for a couple of days!  The sights and tastes of New York have also been a nice break from the trail.

We stopped in a little deli where I had a great cranberry and oat bagel. Then as we wandered toward the Rockefeller Plaza, TheOkie and I grabbed a picture with the FAO Swartz doorman, who had a more luxurious trail beard than either of us. That’s when we saw people lining 5th Avenue for a parade. We joined the crowd and watched a parade celebrating Puerto Rico with many, many Puerto Rican police officers and firefighters in the parade. We eventually moseyed back toward Times Square where we grabbed another Nathan Dog. We sat in Times Square one last time eating our hotdogs and taking in the sights. Then came the hardest part of the great weekend, saying goodbye to my wife. It has been so nice that I’ve been able to see her so frequently on this trip. I also appreciate her bringing out much needed shoes for TheOkie and me. Once we saw her off to the airport, we caught a subway over to Chinatown where we had a great lunch and a lot of interesting sights.  I had a hiker sized portion of chicken, shrimp, and pork fried rice and topped it off with some great pan seared dumplings.  Then it was time to navigate our way back to the NYC train station for our return trip. A pleasant train ride later and we were in Philadelphia where we caught our bus to Allentown after a brief layover. Lucky for everyone, I wasn’t driving the bus, because I could not stay awake. It did make the trip go by fast, though. Once we reached the bus stop, we got an Uber to take us to Target to finish up our resupply. And of course I overbought again because that’s what I do. From there we made the quick walk across the parking lot to Five Guys for burgers and then on to the hotel for the evening.

JFK finally arrived at the hotel after a long day of travel. We were all tired after our busy off-trail weekend and we slept hard. This morning we got up and met our shuttle driver who took us back to The lookout Hostel where we had stored our backpacks. We repacked our food bags and organized our gear while we visited with the folks that were staying there. With the big rains coming, it was very tempting to stay there had we not just had a double zero. We headed across the busy highway 309 and into the woods. The rocks started gradual and then ramped up to full 45° slabs. Thank goodness we had 3 hours of dry rocks before the rains came. We met six day hikers coming up the trail towards us. When they asked where we were going, we told them we were thru hikers. That brought on a fun question and answer session. When we told them we hadn’t seen a bear on the whole trail, they informed us that we were standing between a mother Behr and her three cubs. We got a good laugh out of that. When the rains first hit, I just went with the umbrella since the temperature was still warm. As I was stopped, attaching the umbrella to my backpack’s shoulder strap, a Boy Scout group hiked by. They were in their last day of a 50 mile hike. Once the rains had been around a while, we were reminded that there are things worse than the Pennsylvania rocks:  Wet Pennsylvania rocks!  It doesn’t take much moisture for those things to get very slick. We also decided that the rocky soil isn’t very good for drainage. We already knew that it wasn’t good for driving tent stakes. The rains let up for a while as we walked the high ridge above  Palmerton. That allowed for views of the town far below. Also on the ridge line were the first ripe blueberries I have seen on the trip. I honestly didn’t expect to see any until we reached New Hampshire or Maine. I picked and ate several as we walked along. They were quite tasty. When we reached the shelter we were shooting for, there was only one person there, U Haul, a section hiker. Later Yogi stopped in to eat dinner and then moved on. The water source is very near the shelter and really flowing well. We hear that many of the water sources north of here have dried up. Hopefully this rain will help recharge the springs. Nailed to the shelter as well as above the nearby spring are wooden signs dated 5-21-23 that say: Bear Activity High. The comments in FarOut also indicate a bear sighting on 6-9-23. So we will be sure and get all of our smellables into the bear bag tonight.  Today’s miles moved the needle up to 57% and we are closing in on the end of another state soon. In spite of the rain, it was good to be back on trail and heading north.","The Lookout Hostel

Today’s entry should really read: George W Outerbridge Shelter to Leroy A Smith Shelter to Gateway Motel.  But more about that, later. 
This morning when we woke up we saw that our bear bags were still in tact. So even though we were in a “high bear activity” shelter and Yogi had spilled noodles right in front of the shelter, we still haven’t seen a bear on this trip. 
When we started hiking at 8:00, we knew two things. First, we were immediately facing one of the most iconic climbs on the entire Appalachian Trail, the climb of the rock slide out of Palmerton. It is about a 1,000 foot climb from the Lehigh River to the top of the ridge over Palmerton in about 3/4 of a mile. The second thing we knew was that there were no good water sources on our planned 16.9 mile hike today. 
The climb started off as a steep hike but quickly turned into a rock scramble and then some hand over hand climbing. Eventually, trekking poles became more of a hindrance than a help. The entire climb took about 30 minutes and was actually a lot of fun. We had beautiful weather and the views from the top were great. 
We seemed to hike up on the ridge line for most of the day. In one area, we ran across another huge blueberry patch and grazed them for a bit. In another area, the Allentown Hiking Club had rerouted the trail and did an unbelievable job laying the huge rocks in a flat path connected by enormous rock steps. 
As we knew, there was no water on trail today, but from the FarOut comments, we knew that someone was setting up trail magic at Smith Gap Road, about 13.3 miles into our day. As slow as we were moving with the huge climb and dealing with the relentless rocks, we weren’t very optimistic that they would still be there. As we got closer, we picked up the pace  fueled by hope. 
As we approached the gap, there was a water cache of many gallon jugs of water which is a great help on a dry section like today. But just ahead at the parking area, we could make out a pop up awning. THEY WERE STILL THERE! We practically sprinted out of the woods into the trail magic. 
When we arrived, Yogi and Lone Wolf were just leaving. The trail angels couldn’t have been more gracious. They immediately gave us a soft drink and a chair to sit in. Then they fired up their camp stove and cooked us each two large hotdogs. They also gave us chips, cookies, bananas, watermelon, and filled our water bottles. 
We sat and visited with them for almost an hour. They section hike the trail and have a hiking club. They were so friendly and we really enjoyed sharing our thru hike experiences with them. They said they intended to stay until 4:00, so we actually got there with almost two hours to spare. 
Fueled by the great trail magic, we made quick work of the last 3.6 miles to the Leroy A Smith shelter. When we arrived, there was one other person in the shelter. He was reclined against the wall of the shelter and not particularly talkative. The best we could tell, he had been out a few days but wasn’t sure where he was going. We spread out our sleeping pads and sleeping bags in the shelter then walked about 500 yards downhill to a spring to get water for the evening and tomorrow morning. 
When we returned, I walked over to a nearby tent site to call my parents. A bit later, I got a text from JFK letting me know the guy in the shelter was crazy.  Now I’m not one to cast stones, because arguably anyone that would walk from Georgia to Maine would be considered crazy by a majority of people. But we’re talking about a different kind of crazy, the delusional kind where you start sounding agitated and talking about your clone. 
Again, if you’ve followed this journal from the beginning, you know that my number 5 fear on the trail is crazy people. My plan for dealing with them was to put distance between us. Before I got off of my call and walked back to the shelter, JFK and TheOkie had decided that there were enough red flags to do just that. They had already started packing up their sleep stuff by the time I arrived. I joined in and repacked my pack and we headed back out on trail after our 16.9 mile day, so you know we didn’t take it lightly. The way the guy was mumbling agitated nonsense, I’m not sure any of us would have gotten any sleep in that environment. 
So we wound up hiking 4.5 more miles to Wind Gap and the Gateway Motel. Now this might not be a motel that we would stop at on a family vacation, but it was a two minute walk from the trail and the proprietor Satish couldn’t have been any nicer. 
When we arrived at the office, he insisted that we sit down, so we did. He asked if we would like a soda, so to be polite, and because what hiker wouldn’t want a cold drink after hiking 20 miles, we said yes, thanks. He then proceeded to take three large glasses to the shower and wash them and give us each a glass. Next he gave each of us a scoop of ice from his tabletop ice maker. Then he got a 1 liter coke and poured us each a glass of coke before cannonballing the rest straight from the bottle. After we finished our soda and returned the large glasses to him, he wanted to show us the room. So we followed him to room 2 and walked in the unlocked door. He pushed the furniture out of the way so he could bring in another mattress for us to put on the floor, which was super nice of him. When the bed hit the wall, the cover fell off of the window unit air conditioner. So he had us wait while he went and cleaned the filter. Then it was three trips to get all of the additional pillows and bedding for the mattress on the floor. Then he said he had one more surprise for us and he would be right back.  He came back with a new bottle of aromatherapy body wash, the kind he uses himself, apparently. Very thoughtful. Finally he left us with one last piece of advice. The lady in the room next door is mean. If she beats on the wall, just ignore her. Thanks for the heads up!  
So TheOkie is on the bed, I’m on the floor mattress, and JFK may be the smart one, he is tenting on the lawn.   We have all three opted to sleep in our sleeping bags. On the bright side, we all got a shower, our host couldn’t be more accommodating, and instead of the three of us being in a shelter with a crazy person. only one of us is sleeping with a crazy person in the room with them and I’ll let you decide who that is. 
Today’s extended miles knocked that imaginary needle up to the 58% mark. Tomorrow we should finish our 7th state and start our 8th!  Tonight, we followed our collective gut and avoided a potential bad situation. It’s nice to have options and it’s nice to travel with friends that look out for each other.","George W Outerbridge Shelter

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665517,"“Sunshine is delicious, rain is refreshing, wind braces is up, snow is exhilarating; there is really no such thing as bad weather, only different kinds of good weather.” -John RuskinThe Gateway Motel had a lot of interesting things, but at least it was dark and quiet. I slept in until nearly 7:00. We ate, packed up, and were hiking around 8. Not long after the two minute road walk back to the trail, we entered the woods. Guess what, we had a 500 foot climb straight up the mountain to kick things off. Once we were on the ridge line, we were treated to the normal assortment of Pennsylvania rocks. Then about 10:00 the rains came. I popped up my backpacking umbrella and kept walking. For the most part, that kept my head and torso dry until the winds whipped up later. After the rocks were good and wet, the trail took us over to Wolf Rocks. The huge rock slabs would have been a lot more fun to scramble around on when they were dry and you weren’t fearful of falling with each step. But we survived and kept on walking as the forest became darker and foggy.The rains stayed for about three  hours until we were descending into Delaware Water Gap. Once we walked through the small town, we entered the pedestrian lane of the I-80 bridge. By this time, the sun had made an appearance and dried things out. Midway across the Delaware River we came to the state line separating Pennsylvania from New Jersey. We stopped on the bridge for a few minutes for photos and fist bumps in celebration of completing our 7th state on the trail. As we continued our sunny walk across the bridge, we pulled up the radar on our phones and saw a heavy thunderstorm bearing down on us.  In the distance we could see a covered pavilion at the Kittatinny Point Visitor Center. So we walked over there and posted up at the picnic tables. I grabbed my light fleece jacket and rain jacket and rain pants from my pack and threw them on before the storm hit. I was glad that I did as the rain cooled wind became a bit chilly as we sat there. The thunder boomed around us as we sat protected from the rains. We ate our snacks as TheOkie coordinated our pickup with his family that just arrived in the area today. Later, North Star, Stair Master, and Bobsled stopped under the pavilion for a bit before they moved on. Pennsylvania is known on the AT as Rocksylvania because of the ever present rocks on the trail. Now having completed the entire state, I would agree that it is a well deserved nickname. We’ve certainly seen our share of rocky trails in other states, but the constant rocky beating our feet have taken through the state of Pennsylvania is another level. Today we felt like the state was trying to beat us into submission one last time before letting us leave. We expect the same type of rocks for the first 30 miles of New Jersey as well. I guess to a certain degree, the difficulty of the trail is what makes hiking it such a special accomplishment. TheOkies family arrived and took us to the large vacation home they rented for the week. When we arrived, his daughter had a wonderful dinner prepared for us. After dinner we went to the store to resupply snacks for the next few days and then go to Dairy Queen for the most important meal of the day. The end of Pennsylvania also ends another segment of the FarOut maps. So far on the trip we have climbed 269,528 feet or the equivalent of a 51 mile tall staircase. From the start of the trip until the end of Pennsylvania, I have taken 3,192,008 steps according to the step counter on my phone. Today’s miles push the needle to 59% of the trail completed.","Gateway Motel

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665556,"“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.”  -Michael JordanWith TheOkie’s family visiting, we have the opportunity to slackpack, or hike with a lighter pack carrying the basics needed for the day. Today we decided to slackpack southbound so they dropped us off at Blue Mountain Lakes Road and we walked back to where we ended yesterday’s hike. The drive to both of those places was over an hour, but as we progress up the trail toward the Airbnb, those drive times will get shorter and shorter. We see more hikers hiking southbound because the majority of thru hikers are hiking northbound. The first hiker we saw this morning certainly wasn’t expecting to see another hiker as he was going to the bathroom not very far off the trail. Our running joke is that if you ever get lost on the AT, just go to the bathroom and someone is certain to walk by. After that, we saw lots of hikers and several that we knew. One of the highlights of the day was meeting our friend, Good Soup on one of the ledges that the trail took us to today. We had a nice visit with him as we took in the great views on this beautiful day. One of the most interesting things to come from our conversation was that Good Soup had encountered the crazy person that set off our red flags enough for us to hike out of the shelter. A few new tidbits are that he is on parole and can’t leave the state of Pennsylvania and he says that when he walks, it burns between his legs ever since his alien abduction. Good Soup offered that it sounded like it might just be chafing, but the guy was convinced it was the result of aliens. There were more bizarre stories and they all served to validate listening to our gut. We still haven’t seen a bear on the trail, but we must have been ever so close today. A few miles into the hike we saw a rather large pile of bear scat that was obviously quite fresh. We could also smell the bear until we got a good distance away. Many of our friends have seen a bear by this point and we think we will spy one before too long. We met a crew from the state forest fire department and visited with them for a bit. With the recent rains, they weren’t manning the fire tower, but gave us permission to climb up and check out the views. We did, and the views were amazing. The air was clear and we could once again see ridge after ridge after ridge. On the ground, we saw a couple of pretty large snakes today. One was very dark but patterned and just stayed put. The other one appeared to be a black rat snake and after a brief stare down, he zipped out of there, across the rocks at fantastic speed. Around lunchtime we came to a .2 mile side trail that led to the Mohican Outdoor Center. We stopped in and JFK bought us lunch. I had a burger platter that had chips and cookies washed down with a coke. Fresh, real food always tastes so good on the trail!  We won’t encounter any more Mohican Outdoor Centers on he trail, which makes this the last of the Mohicans. Sorry, I couldn’t resist. We walked along the rocky shoreline of Sunfish Pond, which was formed by glaciers and is one of the seven natural wonders of New Jersey. A few other highlights of the day were finding more blueberries to eat, watching a plane tow and release a glider (TheOkie said that was the first time he had seen that done in New Jersey), being greeted at the end of our hike by TheOkie’s cute little granddaughter holding up a trail magic sign, and watching two bald eagles fly down the Delaware River as we were getting ready to load up and head home. The major highlight of the day was reaching the 1,300 mile mark!  That number just keeps getting bigger and the miles to Katahdin keep getting smaller. Postholer.com has a program that will estimate your finish date. I was sharing that with another hiker today and it seems like the end is racing towards us. But we are out there walking it and making it happen.","Kittatinny Point Visitor Center

After a wonderful breakfast of blueberry pancakes and bacon that TheOkie’s wife prepared, TheOkie’s son in law drove us to our starting point a bit over an hour away.  It was a beautiful morning, but we knew that rain was on its way. 
Throughout much of the hike, we were surrounded by mountain laurel in full bloom. Each delicate bloom is pretty amazing, but when you see a whole hillside of it, it is stunning. 
True to expectations, we still got to walk on plenty of rocks. Luckily, all of the huge rock slabs that we crossed today were dry. That makes the footing so much safer. We were treated to some pretty good stretches of “tourist paths”, also.  Those wide, smooth trails of pine needles, soft dirt, or crushed gravel will definitely spoil you. Some places were so good, that we could even look up and around at our surroundings and not just at our foot placement the whole time.  A few of these times, we walked through truly spectacular areas of forest with stately old trees without significant undergrowth. Even though the dense, high ceiling of leaves gave it a dark feeling, you could see quite a ways in all directions. 
There were also a couple of good  ridge line view spots on today’s route. We met Tarzan on one of these ridge tops. He started a full month after we did and is a younger guy doing huge miles. 
About 1.2 miles from our pickup point, we got phone notifications that the rain was about to hit. I stopped and put on my raincoat. Soon we heard a few crashes of thunder and then the rain started. As the rain fell, we descended down the mountain to a road crossing. The rain seemed much worse when we weren’t protected with the forest canopy. After crossing a busy highway in the rain, the trail tucked us back in the safety of the woods. A short walk later we were picked up and taken back to the house.  
After changing into dry clothes, we had a bit of lunch and a glorious nap. For dinner, we had gourmet burgers and a bounty of other foods, topped off with a delicious homemade coconut cream pie for dessert. We sat around the very comfortable fire pit and had a relaxing evening.  
Today’s shorter hike was a treat to our feet which have taken a real beating the last few hundred miles. Our miles today were enough to crank that imaginary needle to another big milestone, though. We have now passed 60% of the trail!  We should be unstuck and back to bigger miles on more favorable paths soon.","Blue Mountain Lakes Road

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665626,"“One day you will wake up and there won’t be any more time to do the things you’ve always wanted. Do it now.” -Paulo Coelho via Karla GibsonWe got the whole crew loaded up this morning and headed back to the Culvers Gap Trailhead. TheOkie’s daughter and son-in-law joined us for today’s hike. We had great weather for the entire day. Much of the trail was nice, and we were looking forward to hitting the magic line 30 miles into New Jersey where the rocks stop. Spoiler Alert: The people telling us that, lied to us just like the people that told us Virginia was flat. We had lots of rock slabs which were fun to walk on with dry feet. We had areas we had to climb up the rocks. We also had sections of good old chunky rock trail. Maybe the rocks quit tomorrow. Since it rained yesterday, the little orange lizards were out in force. I’m sure we saw over a hundred of the little polka dotted critters. We saw more very tiny ones than before and more of them that were a dull orange color instead of America’s brightest orange. We hiked past a fire tower and more blueberry patches today. On top of Sunrise mountain, we stopped by the large pavilion to take in the views of the distant ridges. We stopped by the Mashipacong Shelter for a lunch snack and to get some water. Some nice person keeps the bear box stocked with five gallon jugs of water since that area doesn’t have great access to water. At the end of our hike, we stopped at the High Point State Park headquarters building. This classic stone and wood lodge style building was very nice. Our next hike will actually take us near the monument erected on the highest point in the state of New Jersey. Our two new hikers did great today. That was a pretty long hike over a lot of rocky terrain. They got a good sampling of things we have experienced throughout this journey. Afterwards, we drove to the nearest town that had a Texas Roadhouse (the official restaurant of our AT journey) and had a great meal. Driving back to our town, we stopped by the grocery store for a few items and then went to Dairy Queen since it was right in the way. Of all of the Choco Dipped Blizzards (the official ice cream treat of our AT journey) we’ve had, this was by far the best. We were in favor of nominating the lady from the Vernon Dairy Queen for company-wide employee of the year.","Culvers Gap Trailhead

If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.” -Ferris BuellerToday is Father’s Day and TheOkie’s family has made the day very special for TheOkie, JFK, and me. They chose this particular time to come out and visit us, slackpack us, treat us to living indoors, and feed us, specifically because it covered Father’s Day. They have really gone above and beyond in serving us. This morning we woke up to a special assortment of everyone’s favorite type of Dunkin Donuts. After our online church services, they prepared the most wonderful lunch. We had chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes, gravy, peas, and shrimp scampi. For dessert, we had his daughter’s famous Black Forest cheesecake that definitely lived up to TheOkie’s hype. For supper we sat around the fire pit and had hotdogs and more of the great cheesecake. We’ve had a great day of resting and relaxing. In addition to receiving Father’s Day wishes from my children, my wife, and a few dear friends, I was able to FaceTime my father and let him know how much I love and appreciate him. We also have had some time to evaluate the rest of our hike. The postholer.com website has a program that estimates when you will hit certain points on the trail. You can continually adjust it based on your progress to date. It is currently estimating a summit day of August 21st, nearly two weeks earlier than my guess when we started this adventure. It will be interesting to see how that changes up or down as we continue our progress. We have also been reading FarOut comments and Trailjournals of people ahead of us to keep an eye on the water situation. This area has been very dry with many water sources unreliable lately. We hope these recent rains make a quick difference, but a lot of places have been relying on water caches provided by trail angels. The next couple of days will be bigger mileage, but for today it was nice to stop and catch up on other areas of life.","High Point State Park Headquarters

I mean the bare necessitiesThat's why a bear can rest at easeWith just the bare necessities of life.”      -BalooWe we’re out the door early this morning because we were doing a bigger mileage day. We drove to the High Point Park Headquarters with the whole crew. TheOkie’s daughter and son-in-law each strapped a child to their back and we all headed up the AT. After hiking 1.1 miles, we reached the wooden observation deck and all stopped to take photos of the 220 foot tall monument. Shortly after that, the AT took a right turn and TheOkie, JFK, and I split off from the others. The others hiked the additional .2 mile side trail up to the monument and climbed the interior staircase to the top. We had beautiful weather all day. The trail definitely had more great treadway than we have been used to seeing, although the rocks still definitely made an appearance and we had a huge steep climb late in the day. We walked past many stacked stone walls out in the middle of the forests. I really wish I knew the history behind them, a lot of effort went into their creation. We walked on several long sections of boards to keep us up above swampy areas and one reroute that had a sign at the junction that said “no, no, no don’t even think about going through the swamp”.  We later met two trail maintainers out clearing the path. We stopped to visit with them and one of them said he was the one that put the warning signs up a couple of years ago when beavers made a dam that raised the swamp level above the boardwalk through it. We let them know how much we appreciated them fighting back the jungle so the trail remains passable. We saw two other signs for “newt crossing” with a really well drawn picture of our little orange, polka dotted friends on them. We got a laugh out of the signs, but didn’t see any newts since it wasn’t raining in the last 24 hours. We had several pasture walks and walked around some ponds and a large wetlands wildlife area. It looked like a federal mosquito breeding project. We walked down state line road and sure enough, the cars in the driveways on the left side of the road had New York license plates. I think the trail actually strayed over into New York a bit today, but ended up back in New Jersey.  Tomorrow we will leave New Jersey for good. At the end of a road walk, there was a house with a “trail magic” sign out front. In their yard, they had a dorm sized refrigerator stocked with free drinks and a wagon with a big water cooler and big jars of pretzels. The people didn’t appear to be home, but had a little notebook that people could use to leave them comments. We saw a new wildflower today. It was an eye catching blue and the research department informed me that it was chicory. The highlight of the day was just before noon. We had just stepped out of the woods onto an empty two lane road for one of today’s many road crossings. I was half way across the road when I heard JFK say “bear, bear”!  My head swiveled around, and sure enough, to my left about 30 feet, a small black bear was also crossing the same road. I unzipped my phone pocket and frantically pulled out my phone. I opened the screen, killed my FarOut app, and opened my camera. By this time the bear had already crossed the road and was on the other side of the guardrail. I was really hoping he would stay put long enough for me to get a photo or a video. I snapped a picture and then switched over to video and tried to acquire the bear in the phone screen. By this time, he had entered the thick underbrush. We crossed the road and walked up the trail trying to see where he was hiding. In the time we were standing there, Seinfeld and another thru hiker had walked up to us. We eventually hiked on. When we stopped and I looked at the one photo I had managed to take, it was mostly road and guardrail. There was a patch of black at the top that I knew was a bear, but honestly it looked like the kind of photo that would never convince someone that you had seen Bigfoot. The videos were no better. I was so disappointed. We have talked about seeing a bear nearly every day since we started. Surely we’ll see one in the Smokies, definitely in Shenandoah, they say New Jersey has the densest bear population…. Nearly all of our hiking friends have seen a bear by now and we were about to have to resort to seeing the poor bears in the Trailside Zoo 50 miles up trail from here. Then, almost like a miracle, I realized that my camera was set to Live Photo mode, which captures about 3 seconds surrounding the snapshot. Even though the final picture was terrible, there was bear gold hiding up in the Live Photo!  Now that may not mean much to you, but after going bearless for 111 days, I was thrilled!  As soon as I found it, I ran out to show TheOkie and JFK!  JFK is quite the bear spotter. Not only did he draw our attention to that one, he saw another one that I only heard as it scrambled over one of the stacked rock walls. He has said that he has a heightened sense of vigilance and I believe him. He’s definitely a good guy to have around!  Today’s mileage moved the needle to 61%. Today’s bear sighting moves that needle off of zero!  We have more big milestones coming our way starting tomorrow.","High Point State Park Headquarters

It doesn’t just happen.” -anonymous 9 year old via Gloria ReynoldsIt was another early morning as the whole crew was headed out to walk one of the iconic pieces of the AT together, the Pochuck Boardwalk. Trail volunteers constructed a boardwalk that is nearly a mile long to take the AT over a large section of New Jersey swamp land. Including other bog boards and bridges, we probably walked on wood for two miles today, keeping us above the mud, muck, and mire of New Jersey. It is quite the construction feat and we all enjoyed walking that far on smooth and level trail. Not long after the boardwalk, the trail snapped us back to reality with a climb up “The Stairway To Heaven Trail”.   When they NAME a climb, you know you’re in for a doozy and this 900 foot climb in less than a mile and a half fit the bill. We were very glad to be carrying lighter packs up this today, even if some of the hikers we passed weren’t as excited for us. The real highlight of the day was finishing all of the trail in New Jersey and crossing over into New York!  We have now completed 8 of the 14 states. We have really enjoyed New Jersey. The beautiful forests we have been walking in are a far cry from the dysfunctional concrete jungle that is portrayed in movies and on TV. The people along the trail and in the trail towns have been very nice also.   The area where we crossed the state line was on top of a granite ridge line that probably went on for a couple of miles. It was like a big jungle gym and a lot of fun since it was dry. I would not want to repeat that section with wet rocks. About a half mile past the state line was Prospect Rock. It is the highest point on the AT in the state of New York and you can barely make out the New York City skyline from there. When we completed our hike, we were met with trail magic again from TheOkie’s family. They have really spoiled us this week!  From there, I walked .2 miles to the Bellvale Creamery. It is an amazing and very popular ice cream shop that is close enough to the trail for hikers to take the side trail and treat themselves. I treated myself to a hot fudge sundae and it was great. Once we returned to the Airbnb, we showered and went to eat.  On the way back, we stopped to buy our final resupply items for the next few days. Then it was laundry and organizing time. Tomorrow is back to the reality of heavy packs, tuna packets, and sleeping pads. That’s what we signed up for, but this week has been really nice.

This morning I had a Zoom meeting, so since we were having a late start on the trail, TheOkie’s wife and daughter fixed us bacon, eggs, and pancakes for breakfast. After my meeting TheOkie’s wife drove us to the trailhead where we finished yesterday.  After saying our goodbyes, we were dumped back into reality. We realized this right away when we strapped on our fully resupplied packs. Todays hike seemed like a repetitive loop. Climb a ridge, descend to a dry creek. Climb a ridge, descend to stagnant water. Climb a ridge…. In fact today’s hike seemed to have more ridges than a bag of Ruffles!  Now don’t get me wrong, many of the climbs were fun slabs or crazy actual rock climbs. There were just so many of them.  We were extremely thankful that we were able to do all of that on dry rock today. The prospects for the weather in the near future do not seem as promising. One of the features today was the “trail famous” Lemon Squeezer, a narrow chute of rock with high walls that the trail is routed through. It starts about shoulder width and then tapers down the farther you go. Eventually you can climb up and out of it. It was actually fun and broke up the day. Just past that was an actual rock wall that we had to rock climb up. That was quite a challenge with the extra weight of a backpack pulling you backwards. We had beautiful weather all day again. We also hiked through some beautiful forests. At one point after we had already climbed several ridges we were quite thirsty, but conserving water because nearly all of today’s water sources are dried up or stagnant puddles. When we came to a road crossing, there were eight gallon jugs of water left there by trail angels with the Tuxedo hiking club. What a welcomed sight!  There was no good water after that today, although we did dip some of the less disgusting water from one place as a last resort. Our water filters will get a workout with that.  Another interesting thing we encountered today was the constant rumble of howitzer fire. We are hiking near West Point and I’m not sure if the sound is from there or if there is another military base in the area. When we finally arrived at the large stone shelter around 7:00, we met thru hikers Cruise Control and Encore, who are siblings from Massachusetts. After my anniversary dinner of spam and cheezits on tortillas, I called and talked to my wife. In addition to June 21st being my wedding day and Summer Solstice, it is also “hike naked day” or I guess you could just call it “the reason why you have to register with your state authorities each time you move day”.  You can see from today’s pictures that we did not participate in this holiday. Today’s miles nudged our needle to 63%.  We will hit another big milestone tomorrow. We just keep on moving towards the end of the trail. Some days, like today, it seems hard both physically and emotionally, but we just don’t quit.","NY Route 17A

She apologized and moved him as close to the far wall as possible, a good three feet away from JFK.  I’m no scientist, but does anyone know how far Norovirus can travel?  Just kidding, I’m sure it was something totally different. In spite of that revelation, I think we all slept quite well.  I guess the shelter faced East, because it got really light in there super early. We got started around 7:30 and hiked 1.1 miles to a road crossing that led down to a large state park beach. From a thru hiker’s point of view, it had real restrooms, fresh water, soda vending machines, and trash cans. After using all of their services, we hiked back up the hill and rejoined the AT. The forecast rains held off quite a while, which was great since we still had a lot of rocks and rock slabs to navigate. Before noon, we were surprised to hike up on Good Soup and Branch. Good Soup had been ahead of us, but was doing a short slackpack today. We came across them at the first of the 1,400 mile markers laid out in stones. That’s right, we have now crossed the 1,400 mile mark on this epic journey!  We took our traditional photos and had a round of fist bumps with all present. Soon it was time to decide if we would follow the traditional AT path across the Palisades Parkway or take the new blue blazed detour that leads you a few miles around to an overpass to cross the busy road. Good Soup and Branch took the detour and the three of us played human Frogger and took the traditional route. I mean if Grandma Gatewood could outrun all of those cars in her canvas Keds tennis shoes, surely we could. Since I’m writing this journal entry I guess you know we made it. There certainly was a lot of traffic, but we patiently waited for a break before we made our crossing. We started getting misted on, then sprinkled on, then drizzled on, and eventually rained on. Until about the last thirty minutes of the rain, I didn’t use my raincoat or umbrella. It was in the 60’s and we were doing lots of climbing. Eventually when we were descending I cooled down and did use my umbrella for a bit. Later the sun came out and my clothes dried. After the Palisades Parkway crossing, we came across another 1,400 mile marker. Then we climbed and climbed about 600 feet up West Mountain. Then it was back down followed by about a 700 foot climb up Bear Mountain. There were so many stairs climbing up that mountain and then even more stairs climbing back down. Even though the observation tower on top was closed for a construction project, we still had good views of the New York City skyline in the distance. After coming down the over two mile long staircase off of Bear Mountain, we reached another one of the quirky attractions of the AT, the Trailside Zoo. The AT literally white blazes its way through the zoo, including a stop at the bear exhibit where we saw two bears relaxing in their large enclosure. I’m so glad we finally saw a bear in the wild this week, so the zoo wasn’t our first bear sighting. After taking advantage of the zoo’s restrooms and soda vending machines, we walked out of there and onto the Bear Mountain Bridge. The enormous half mile long bridge that crosses the Hudson River was built in 1924. That was the last level ground we would see today. After the bridge, it was up, up, up about two miles to camp. We arrived at camp soaked through and through, not by rain, but by sweat. Seinfeld was already here setting up his tent and we all quickly set our tents up on the least rocky and least slanted spots we could find. After braving the mosquitoes to collect water from a brook about a quarter mile downhill I washed most of the mud and some of the sweat off of me with a bandanna. Tonight’s dinner was tuna packets on tortillas, then it was time to get in the tent before the mosquitoes carried me off. It was another very hard day with lots of climbing. It felt like spending the day on a stair master. Several times today, I thought to myself, I’m glad I know that I can do hard things, because this is hard. Although it seemed close, I never had to crawl on the near vertical climbs, and I certainly didn’t give up. Today’s miles sent us over the 1,400 mile mark and moved that needle to 64% of the trail completed.","Fingerboard Shelter

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665911,"“Be still sad heart! And cease repining. Behind the clouds is the sun still shining. Thy fate is the common fate of all. Into each life some rain must fall.” -Henry Wadsworth Longfellow The Rainy Day 1841Much to the surprise and pleasure of all of us, we packed up dry tents this morning. We had another big day planned, so we got an early start leaving before 7:30. The first exciting thing of the day was hiking into the Appalachian Market and Deli. We were stopping there to do a light resupply, but I also had a great ham and egg bagel and bought a huge sub sandwich to pack out for supper. I’ve said many times on this trip that I wished I knew the story behind some of the stone walls we have hiked past. Today, I got an answer on a couple of them. One was a foundation of a building that was used in 1776 to inoculate the army against a small pox epidemic at the request of George Washington.  Another was a tall stone turnpike used by horse teams to haul ore from the mines. The stone stacking business must have been huge in this part of the country back in the day. Today we hiked about three hours in the rain. I was soaked before the rains even started. I eventually wore my raincoat, for warmth. I wasn’t miserable, just soaked. At the end of the day, we knew that there was a Café at the Canopus Lake where we were headed. A mile and a half out, there was a sign indicating the hours and the ominous phrase, weather permitting. We were racing the clock and running on fumes at the end of an 18 mile day with over 4,000 feet of climbing. When we arrived, the grill was still open!  We all had an amazing burger and fries for a late lunch. We also were able to charge our battery banks, use their restrooms, and fill our water containers. Then it was the question of which is the least worst:  sleep in the shelter and risk the mosquitoes drilling you dry, or set up the tent and pack it away wet in the morning since there is a very high probability of rain through the night. We opted for the shelter.  Seinfeld is staying in the shelter as well.  Once I got my bed laid out, I changed into dry clothes. That felt absolutely wonderful. Tomorrow morning putting the wet ones back on will be the opposite of that. I have strung a clothesline in the shelter, but at 121% humidity and rain, I’m not very optimistic that it will be dry by morning.  I’m am however pretty sure my pruned feet will start looking normal again by then.  Other interesting things in today’s hike included seeing a spotted salamander that was coal black with yellow polka dots.  We also walked past the “wind phone” which is an old school telephone at the edge of nowhere that is mounted to a kiosk and not connected to anything. Many people stop by the phone to have conversations with their lost loved ones. Some of the people’s stories can be found on Instagram. Another interesting thing today was that I fell on the wet rocks. It was my first fall since the icy trail coming off of Clingman’s Dome over 1,200 miles ago. My trekking poles have saved me from hundreds of falls on the trip, but today when I started slipping, they couldn’t get a grip on the wet rock either. I didn’t land too hard or awkwardly and don’t think I hurt anything. In a show of solidarity, JFK slipped on the wet rocks, too. So I know that into each life some rain must fall, but it would be great if it would fall at night and be dry when we are hiking on granite slabs.","Hemlock Springs Campsite

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665962,"“Rain, rain, go away.” -The Good Half of a Children’s Nursery Rhyme
The rain on the shelter roof this morning was loud enough to hear it through earplugs. We weren’t in any real hurry to get going since we only had a 14 mile day and we knew it would be a wet one. I put on my rain pants and rain jacket in a futile attempt at staying dry today. We walked back up to the beach bathrooms to get water and have our breakfast. The more we hiked, the wetter I got. I’m not certain if it was more from sweat or rain. 
By 9:30 we had climbed to the top of Shenandoah Mountain. At the top of the mountain, someone has painted a large American flag as a 9/11 memorial. 
For the next seven miles we hiked up and down the ridges in the rain. After yesterday’s falls, we were reminded that each step down wet rock has the potential to send us home. 
We were fueled with the knowledge that at a road crossing 10 miles into our day, we could take a half mile road walk to a pizzeria and deli. Just as we reached the road, the rain stopped. We took off our shirts and wrung them out for the second time of the day. Each time, the water just poured out of them. We quickly walked to the pizzeria and ate our fill and stood in the sunshine. 
By the time we had walked back to the trail, we were fairly dried out. I realized that as much as I think I have a strong mental game, the sunshine after walking in the rain for hours had a profound impact on my attitude. As I trudged along in the rain, I often reminded myself that I was just wet, not wet and miserable. I told myself that I was capable of doing hard things, that all of the successful thru hikers before me have put up with the same conditions. I kept my head down and just plowed up and down the hills. But when that sunshine hit me, everything just felt lighter, better. 
The shelter we were hiking to doesn’t have a good water source. Like most of New York so far the stream is dried up. We had seen a comment on FarOut that at a trailhead 2.5 miles before the shelter, a trail angel had left a water cache of 60 one-gallon jugs of water. When we arrived, there were probably 40 gallons left. We greatly appreciate all of the trail magic we have received, but these water caches are truly critical. 
At the shelter, we quickly changed into dry clothes and hung the wet clothes up in a vain attempt at drying them out for tomorrow. Wet socks and shoes all day have caused some calluses to begin to tear away from my feet. 
Rain chances are above 90% through next Thursday, so we’ve got that going for us. Actually since it wasn’t raining when we got to camp and we were able to get things set up, eat, and do our camp chores without it raining, it makes it bearable. But, if it would like to go away, we’d appreciate it. We’d even compromise and let it rain all it wanted at night. 
Today’s miles moved the needle to the 65% mark!  We are still closing in on a few more milestones very soon. Today we saw beautiful forests, the generosity of strangers, God replenishing the Earth with rain, and how happy sunshine could make us. Another great day on the AT.","Canopus Lake Beach Shelter

This morning I woke up knowing it was going to be a great day because I was going to the Wiley Shelter.  There was dense fog and a 90% chance of rain, so I put on my wet hiking shorts and wet wool tshirt. I did allow myself the luxury of putting on dry socks. I strapped wet clothes and socks to the outside of my pack, in hopes that they would dry out at some point in the day. 
JFK had left the shelter last night and set up his tent when Hiawatha had come in late and squeezed into the shelter. JFK, had contemplated tenting earlier because of the mosquitoes, but not wanting a repeat of the Dying Swan incident sealed the deal. He was the first up and left camp before TheOkie and me. 
As we were hiking along, down a nice dirt path in a beautiful forest, it seemed as if someone all of a sudden turned up the house lights. The sun came shining through the dense canopy and it stayed with us all day long. What a pleasant difference a day makes!  
By the time we hiked by Nuclear Lake, before 10:00, the day was already gorgeous with blue skies and billowing clouds. The lake was beautiful. After learning about the 1972 explosion that spewed plutonium dust into the air, I kind of regretted eating the blueberries along the shore line, even if they were the largest ones I’ve seen on the trail. 
Nine miles into the day, we came to the Dover Oak. This is the largest oak tree on the Appalachian Trail and estimated to be over 300 years old. 
There were several swampy areas on today’s route. We crossed numerous bog boards, which were very slippery, and a really long boardwalk. Checking the weather on the sunny boardwalk showed the heat index to be 102°. 
Just past the boardwalk, we came to the Appalachian Trail train platform which is an official stop of the Metro North Railroad. There was actually a hiker at the platform waiting to take a train. 
As the trail turned down a highway for a short distance, we came to the DC Malaysian Food Truck. I don’t know that I’ve ever eaten Malaysian before, but it was open, along the trail, and we were hungry so it seemed meant to be. I had a pork and noodle dish that was excellent. The Coke that washed it down was a treat on a hot day as well. 
From there we waddled up hill through some scenic pastures and then back into the woods. A half mile before the shelter, we were able to collect water for tonight and in the morning. 
At camp I took a bandana bath to knock off the salt and grime from the warm day of hiking. The clothes on my pack were dry, but the ones I had been wearing were again soaked with sweat. All of our clothes are beginning to smell a bit like we went off and left them sealed up in the washing machine for a few days. At some point soon, we will need a proper food resupply and real laundry. 
Seinfeld, Bean, Bird, and Hiawatha have pushed on, but Encore, Cruise Control (who is still sick and may have giardia), and Griz are tenting here. 
It truly has been a great day. We have a long day planned tomorrow so we are hoping to get a very early start. Our miles today moved us to 66% completed on the imaginary dial. Tomorrow we have a big milestone coming up.","Morgan Stewart Shelter

We got up around 5:00 this morning for our big day. We finished packing up at the picnic table where it was lighter and we wouldn’t disturb the other person in the shelter. 
Before 7:00, we hit the Connecticut border, our 10th state of the 14!  It is always a boost to walk into a new state, but this one starts the list of states I’ve never been to before. We took our photos and had our fist bumps then moved on to climb Ten Mile Hill. 
On the way up, I heard something take off running to my right. It was a bear!  It ran to the brush line and stopped, so I yelled to the others so they could come down and see it. It wasn’t even 7:30 and we had already had a pretty exciting morning. 
When we climbed down the other side of the mountain, we came to the Housatonic River, a very large river with lots of rapids at that point. When we came out of the woods at a road crossing, we decided to take the short side trail to Bulls Bridge, a covered one lane bridge by Kent, Connecticut. We walked through the bridge and down to the country store to resupply for the next few days and to get a morning snack. 
Returning to the trail, we had lots of climbs. We had a lot of great trail today, but some very noteworthy rock areas. The rocks were made more of an issue when the rains started. 
We eventually hiked into a shelter to get water, take a lunch snack break, and sit out the rain. At the shelter, we saw Chicken Wing who we met yesterday, and another person who was already in bed and wearing a medical mask. They said they had been at the shelter for two days and my first thought was Noro - don’t touch anything. 
As we hiked on, another big storm developed and was coming our way. We had another mountain to cross and this storm had lightning in it. Since you may recall lightning was my number one fear coming into this thru hike, I kicked it into high gear to get past the mountain summit at Caleb’s Peak, to beat the storm. I barely made it to the descent before the storm.  But by this time the new wave of rain had hit, making the trail of jumbled granite slabs a very dangerous route to the safety of lower ground. 
Eventually we made it to the road that was just up off of the river. We had a 2 1/2 mile flat, smooth walk in the rain to tonight’s shelter. The shelter filled up quickly as we all tried to deal with our soggy clothing and gear. It was in the 70’s today, so the rain just changed our clothes from being soaked in the saltwater of sweat to being soaked in the freshwater of rain.  No one is looking forward to putting the wet, stinky things back on in the morning.  We are looking at our options of going into a town to dry out and do laundry after tomorrow’s hike.  
Also tenting at the shelter area tonight is Shawn the Ridge Runner.  He is here because of reports of someone stealing hikers’ food out of the bear boxes. Bear boxes are a large metal container with clasps to secure our food from the bears and mice. They have had several reports recently at this shelter and the shelter we stopped at for lunch, of not a bear, but a person stealing the food. Surprisingly, the person we saw in bed at the last shelter is the prime suspect. I would have never thought about that happening, but in some areas that could cause you real problems. 
Today’s hike had the big milestone of a new state, but also of moving our needle to 67%. That’s right, we are OVER 2/3 of the way to Katahdin!  We still have a few more big milestones coming up in the next few days, too.  But tonight it is STILL raining and there is no less than an 80% chance of rain through Thursday.  So as Dory would have us do, we’ll just keep swimming up trail and hopefully get a chance to dry out some in the near future.","Wiley Shelter

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666127,"“We all live with two types of pain, the pain of discipline, or the pain of regret.”Yesterday’s rains continued through the night with lots of thunder and lightning. I was glad to be in the shelter where I was dry, even if my clothes were dripping wet. With the continuous rain, nothing dried out overnight. We had decided that after our hike, we would get a shuttle into town and stay at a hotel where we could do laundry, dry out, and have our first shower in a week. Sounded like a great plan!  Since we were going into town, I started out hiking in my dry clothes that I had slept in, my sun hoodie and jogger pants, instead of putting on my soaking shorts and t-shirt. The day started out with a nice walk along the Housatonic River for a couple of miles. The sun was out and it was steamy humid. When the trail turned to go into the woods, it was headed straight uphill. I opted to put my wet tshirt on since I knew in a matter of minutes my shirt would be soaked anyway. As soon as I started uphill, I knew that I just didn’t have it today. I had no leg strength to climb and I felt like I was suffocating trying to catch my breath in the steamy, humid air. I would look for the next white blaze and tell myself, you can make it to there. I repeated that all the way to the top. At the top there was a small breeze and it felt like I could finally catch my breath. I was pretty good on the flat sections or downhills, other than the wet, slippery rocks snd roots, but every uphill today was a struggle. It rained on us a few times today, but just stayed muggy with wet vegetation pressing in on us most of the day. I told the guys that I wasn’t sure if today was my most challenging day on trail, or just the most recent very challenging day. About four miles into the day, we came to Guinea Brook. On a normal day I think you can rock-hop across it. After all of the recent rains, the rocks were submerged under the flowing water. So I stopped and took off my mostly dry joggers and put on my still wet shorts and my water shoes and safely made it across with helpful guidance from TheOkie and JFK. The rest of the hike was a lot of plodding along keeping my head down to avoid slippery wet rocks. We did go through enormous patches of large ferns and one section at the top of a mountain that had wide, level pine needle covered trail. THAT is the trail I would like to see more of. At times we could hear reviving engines go towards us, then away from us. High up on a mountain there was a  ledge that we could get views from, and we saw that we were above an automobile race track. It was interesting to watch from above for a few seconds. Thankfully we eventually made it down to US Route 7 and called Mr. Patel of the Hitching Post Country Motel. The FarOut app said they had laundry and would shuttle you to and from the trail, so that sealed the deal. TheOkie made the call and soon, Mr. Patel arrived in his Mercedes sedan. We actually stuffed three backpacks in the trunk and three stinky hikers into the nicest shuttle vehicle we have ridden in on the trip. Cornwall Bridge, Connecticut doesn’t have many dining options, so he dropped by a convenience store where we loaded up on snacks and later we ordered delivery from a pizza place in Goshen.  As the pizza and salads arrived, Mr. Patel showed up with a portable table and folding chairs so we could eat outside our rooms.  Chicken Wing is also staying here, so she joined us at our hiker trash parking lot picnic. Now all of my clothes are clean and dry thanks to Mr. Patel, and I’m no longer walking around wearing only my rain pants and rain jacket. Our gear is dry or drying. Our bellies are full and I have a nice soft bed to sleep in. It was definitely a day that having TheOkie and JFK with me made a huge difference. While I struggled, I kept going, trying to pace off of them. While we don’t talk the entire day, the joking and teasing lightens the day. And on a day that I was solidly on the struggle bus, that helped a lot.","Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter

The decision to go in, shower, eat town food, do laundry, and dry out was an excellent one, even though the drying out part was short lived. We loaded up in Mr. Patel’s Mercedes shuttle just before the 10:00 check out time.  He delivered us back to the trail on a bright sunny day. 
After a little road walking and a bit of nice woods walking along the Housatonic, we reached the big milestone of the day, 1,500 miles!  We took our celebration pictures at the iron bridge of Falls Village. From there, it was a short hike to a great viewing spot of the rain swollen Great Falls. I have seen many pictures of this spot through the years, but never with this volume of water flowing over it. 
Then the serious hiking of the day began, an 850 foot climb to the top of Mt Prospect. I was nervous about the climb because of how poorly I had climbed yesterday. To my great relief, this first climb went much better today. 
A mile and a half later, we came to the huge rock standing upright by itself and named Giant’s Thumb. Legend has it that this is the spot that the Thumb Booty Dance was invented. 
As we hiked past Salisbury, a lady pulled over and told us that if we needed water, there was a spigot we could use in the cemetery across the street. We filled our bottles and hiked on trying to beat a line of afternoon thunderstorms. 
In trying to race to the shelter before the lightning, I was somewhat successful in the fact that no lightning materialized, but very unsuccessful in keeping dry. Before I got to the shelter, the trail became a series of ponds. 
We are staying in the NEW Brassie Brook shelter which was just completed and opened in June. When I got in the shelter, North Star and Stairmaster were lounging inside all dry. I was a bit jealous. After the rains had stopped, they pushed on.  Later on, Veggie stopped in to eat and then Sour Patch and Burrito stopped in for a meal. 
We got out of our cold, wet clothes and being the eternal optimists, hung them up to dry for tomorrow.  
Today JFK and I celebrate 4 months on the trail, we crossed the big 1,500 mile mark, and we have another huge milestone early tomorrow morning. Connecticut has been beautiful. Wet, but beautiful.

We had just gotten inside our sleeping bags around hiker midnight, 8:00, when an eccentric older man walked up to the shelter, hiking with a large section of a tv antenna pole for his staff and an umbrella tucked into his belt. We exchanged pleasantries and then he chatted more and more and more. JFK likes to say that really talkative people have a long string, like the old talking dolls that you would pull their string to make them talk. This man may have had the longest string we ever saw. We eventually got to sleep on the very damp and chilly night. I had tried the old trick of placing my wet clothes between my sleeping pad and the floor to force the water out of them while I slept. Yeah, that didn’t work. I got up about 6:45 and put on my cold wet clothes, had my usual breakfast of peanut butter crackers and a peanut butter Cliff bar, packed up, and we were hiking by 7:30. The morning started out hiking through very dense tunnels of mountain laurel in full bloom. It was an amazing sight with the millions of white and pink blooms surrounding us like a heavy snow. In the first 1.3 miles, we climbed to the top of Bear Mountain about 700 feet taller than where the shelter was located. There were very steep rock slabs leading to the top. The wet rocks were quite slick and parts of the trail looked a bit like a river running down towards us. It turns out climbing up Bear Mountain was the easy part. The steep wet rock slabs coming down were treacherous, causing us to study each step we took. Overall today was our slowest pace on a hike so far. Shortly after making it down from Bear Mountain, we hit the state line. Goodbye Connecticut, hello Massachusetts!  We have now completed 10 of the 14 states on the trail. Massachusetts welcomed us by hiking through Sages Ravine.  It was one of the most beautiful spots I’ve seen on the trail. We followed Sawmill Brook through an old growth hemlock forest and it was stunning. The Brook had waterfalls and deep rock lined pools. The forest had huge old trees and a carpet of moss covering the boulders surrounding the trail. Next we climbed Mount Race which had great ledges that under normal conditions would probably have the best views we have seen in a long time. However, the current conditions are the reappearing of Canadian wildfire smoke, so there were no real views to be had. Our third mountain to climb for the day was Mount Everett at just over 2,600 feet. We saw Sour Patch and Burrito at the summit and visited with them a bit. They had also had a very lengthy encounter with the chatty gentleman last night as they were trying to hurry down from Bear Mountain before they ran out of daylight. Sour Patch had just received an apple from a day hiker and she shared it with us. Real, fresh fruit  was wonderful, although I guess the wild blueberries that I’ve been grazing on are real, fresh fruit as well. All of the climbs were hard and all of the descents down wet rock slabs and ledges were dangerous.  A few places were so steep that they actually had chunks of wood bolted onto the face of the rock like a sort of makeshift set of stairs. I actually slipped down twice today on the wet rock, but wasn’t hurt. When the rock is that steep, if your feet go out from under you, your bottom isn’t that far away from the rock. Once we finally made it safely down the last mountain, we had more muddy paths through pretty forests and then through a swampy area. The mosquitoes were so thick in the swampy area that JFK finally just took off in a run before they drained him dry. I think he feels the same way about mosquitoes as I do thunderstorms. We eventually made it to the highway into Great Barrington. After striking out on a shuttle or an Uber, we walked half a mile down the road to a nice restaurant. The staff and customers there were all super friendly to us. After eating we got a shuttle to a motel where we showered and eventually did laundry to dry things out again. We walked to a nearby grocery store to resupply for the next few days, and then next door to McDonald’s for supper. Today’s hike ends our seventh map for the trip, and we have three map sections remaining. To this point, we have climbed 311,697 feet or you could picture it as a staircase just over 59 miles tall. Since I began this journey, I have now taken 3,708,677 steps when I’ve had my phone with me. We moved the imaginary needle to 69% and have completed 10 states. We are expecting the Canadian wildfire smoke to intensify in our area again. Several hikers we have talked with are planning to get off trail, but we are not planning to at this point. After my particularly challenging day two days ago, I am relieved to string together a couple of days where I felt like I had my strength back. I sincerely appreciate everyone’s prayers and support!  I feel all of you pulling me toward Katahdin and I am thankful to have you along on this journey.","Brassie Brook Shelter

Luckily, we had arranged a 9:30 shuttle pickup, so we were able to sleep in a bit.  I had bought a large, .62 lb package of ham last night to have for breakfast this morning.   I think I have been losing a bit more weight and wanted to maximize my town food and get more protein. I made two large tortilla wraps and was barely able to finish them and a 32oz Gatorade.  Just before 9:30, we stuffed the three of us and our three backpacks that were bulging with resupplied food, into Jess’ tiny Suzuki car. She quickly delivered us to the trail and we were on our way. We started out with some field walking along the Housatonic River. Then it was the first three ridge climbs of a day with over 3,000 feet of climbing. We also walked past a couple of large, beautiful mountain ponds today. The largest one was Benedict Pond in the Beartown State Forest. The trail took us out to the edge of a few great ledges, but again the smoke obscured what otherwise would have been spectacular views. We also walked through and around a few more deep ravines with moss covered giant, house sized rocks and huge old trees. There were far fewer slanted rock slabs to climb and descend today, and for the most part, the rocks were dry. We walked through one area with piles of mangled dead trees littering both sides of the trail. On one tree near the trail, there was a wooden sign attached that said “Tornado Alley”. While I’m guessing a tornado was responsible for the path of destruction, the sign held other significance for TheOkie and me, as we have friends that have a very successful company named Tornado Alley back home. We again were treated to millions of mountain laurel blooms today. It is truly a spectacular sight. Another highlight of the day was right after a road crossing, the trail took us through a small parking area. When we looked in, we saw Sister Bear with an incredible trail magic setup. She usually sets up in that parking lot on weekends and loves visiting with hikers. When we arrived, Golden Girl and Nancy Drew were there. They were getting ready to leave and gave us their seats. Sister Bear had ice cold sodas and Gatorade, fresh fruit, nuts, cookies, candy, bug spray, toilet paper, bandaids, and even replacement tips for hiking poles. She was a lot of fun to talk with, but we eventually had to leave to make it to our shelter. Our shelter tonight is a huge log structure, but looks to be one of the older shelters we’ve stayed in. There is a water source just past the picnic table which is convenient for water, but leads to A LOT of mosquitoes. After my dinner of precooked bacon and grape tomatoes wrapped up in tortillas, it was time to journal and get in bed where my legs are more protected from the bugs. Today’s miles moved our needle to the big 70% mark!  Also, for the month of June, we hiked 410.2 miles.

We survived our night at the mosquito buffet. Barely. I slept soundly from 7:38 to 8:11 last night. Then the ultra-high-pitched buzzing brought me out of the quality sleep that I just couldn’t consistently return to. I tried my ear plugs, but there are just some frequencies that they apparently don’t block. 
TheOkie and I both had on our bug headnets, or our hairnets as JFK refers to them. We all three tried to stay scrunched down in our sleeping bag liners to keep all of our skin from being exposed. Things like elbows, poking the fabric made easy targets as did JFK’s exposed head. He woke up looking like he had just gone ten rounds with Apollo Creed and needed Mick to cut above his eye. The bright side is that we got an early start on our hiking day since no one wanted to linger around and be mosquito food. 
We had a pretty flat hike today, which was nice. Any views were still hazy from the Canadian smoke. About six miles into our day we came up on another iconic AT spot, the Trail Stand. This small shed just off of a road crossing offers sodas, snacks, and ice cream for sale to hikers. Normally it is just on the honor system, but the owner of the stand happened to be out doing lawn work snd stopped to visit with us. Nancy Drew, Golden Girl, and Point Man stopped in for a snack as well. 
Later, we walked up on Happy, who hiked the trail last year, and she offered each of us a Coke and a clementine as trail magic. She was just out hiking for the day with Spartan, who is doing a section hike.  
After a boardwalk, some bog bridges, and some more beautiful woods walking, we came upon Upper Goose Pond, our destination for today. Our friend Maps, who is now two days ahead of us, highly recommended we stay here. There is a large cabin and bunkhouse that we can stay in. In the mornings, the caretaker of the cabin makes pancakes for all of the hikers. So far tonight, Spartacus and Old Scout have joined us here. 
I walked down to the dock on the lake. The water is so clear that you could watch the perch picking up and spitting out stones as they made their nests. The lake is large and quite scenic and apparently can be accessed by more than just foot, as there were a handful of motor boats out on it. 
The caretaker’s 5 year old daughter, Chipmunk, has made a chipmunk village and makes sure that everyone walks over to see it. It is quite the setup with twig bridges, moss beds, pine cone living areas, and much more that the forest has provided. 
It was really nice to have a shorter hike today, a couple of dry days in a row, and a screened in place to sleep tonight. Here’s hoping that sleep comes early, deep, and uninterrupted from the insidious ultra-high-pitched buzzing that made such a difference last night!","North Mt Wilcox Shelter

Then at about 4:00, it started to rain and sleeping in the bunkhouse became great. We packed up and headed down to get the delicious pancakes a bit after 6. Those were quite a treat and the high point of the day. JFK had tented and packed up when the rains started, so he hiked out before TheOkie and me. We left out a bit before 7:00 in a very light rain. Soon we were sweating In our rain jackets, so we took them off. Not long after that the rains picked up, but we decided to be cool and wet instead of hot and wet. Not long after that, the bottom fell out of the clouds and it came a blinding rainstorm for a few hours. We weren’t dry again all day. If it wasn’t raining, it was misting or we were getting “wind showers” when the breeze would blow the rain out of the forest canopy. Otherwise we were wet with sweat from climbing over mountains in the humid fog. The trail today was a series of mud puddles connected by occasional rocks or roots. We tried to stay out of the deeper mud as best we could. At one point we were rock hopping across a stream, like we’ve done many times before. The rocks didn’t go straight across, so I had to go across a couple of rocks then pivot off of a peaked rock and change direction to the rocks that went to the far bank. As my foot hit the peaked rock, before I could push off of it to change direction, I found myself face down on a couple of the rocks. I’m still not sure how I didn’t just end up submerged in the stream. It was my worst fall of the trip. TheOkie heard the commotion and turned to check on me. It appeared that all parts were still working. I’ll probably have a few bruises to show for it, but I’m super thankful that I wasn’t injured.  Eleven miles into our day, we came upon another iconic AT institution, The Cookie Lady. We had stopped by The Southern Cookie Lady back at the end of March and she set the bar pretty high!  The Cookie lady today is not the original, but when they bought the blueberry farm, she decided to carry on the tradition of the original Cookie Lady. Since we had never seen the original Cookie Lady, we would have believed anyone to be her, much like the dread pirate Roberts. We were able to sit in the rockers on the porch for a bit and enjoy a couple of chocolate chip cookies. We visited with Hikelangelo, the Ridgerunner for a bit, then refilled our water bottles and hiked on. The trail was still a slippery, muddy mess all of the way into Dalton. Our first stop was at Angelina’s Sub Shop where I had a 12” hot pastrami sub with grilled onions. After hiking over 20 miles, it really hit the spot. Then we went to work trying to find a room to dry things out and a ride to get there. After several attempts, we wound up at the Pittsfield Econolodge.  Northstar and Stairmaster are also staying here. After a good hot shower, we walked across the street to McDonald’s for dinner. We opted to just let our clothes dry out tonight and we will do laundry on the 4th when we are in Williamstown for the holiday. Today’s miles moved the needle to 71% of the trail completed. Today’s rains made my feet look like those of a cadaver. Today’s lesson was wet shoes on wet rocks can be hazardous to your health.","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666384,"“I’ve got a theory that if you give 100 percent all of the time, somehow things will work out in the end.” -Larry BirdIt rained again over night, but we were sleeping inside where no rain or mosquitoes could bother us. When we woke up, we walked back over to McDonald’s for breakfast and then waited for the shuttle to pick us up and take us back to the trail. I had originally planned to treat my feet to dry socks and let the wet socks dry on top of my backpack, but when we walked back from breakfast it was already misting and we were expecting thunderstorms again today and all night. The shuttle couldn’t pick us up until after 10:00, so we got a late start. We only had 13.5 miles to hike, so we began our race to see if we could arrive at the shelter before the rain did. We started out easy enough with a couple of miles of road walking through Dalton, the town that manufactures the paper that is used to print U S currency according to a local. Once we returned to the woods, the trail headed up. After a while, we met a couple of shelter maintainers and visited with them a bit. They said that once we got to the top of the ridge, it would get swampy, but we wouldn’t have to climb any more until we got closer to our shelter at the end of the day. They were correct on all accounts. The swampy areas of the trail had actually seemed to have receded slightly from yesterday’s washout. While none of us fell today, I know that at least my shoes resembled chocolate dipped strawberries by the end of the hike. We crossed a lot of deep black mud and were successful on stepping on rocks or roots most of the time, but not all of the time. At one point I slipped off of a little log that was extended out into the muddy waters of the trail. I would love to see a video of it, because it felt like I was tap dancing on the water in a very ungraceful manner trying to hop to one bank or the other and preserve as much dry shoe space as possible. The highlight of the day was when the trail spit us out of the woods and into a neighborhood in Cheshire. A few houses into this road walk we could see an awning set up next to the street. As we approached, we heard “would you like any lemonade?”  A young man and his dog, Peanut were selling lemonade to passing hikers. You talk about location, location, location, that was like shooting fish in a barrel!  Of course we wanted lemonade, and cookies, and shade, and chairs. TheOkie covered our tab and we sat in the shade and had a great visit with the fellow. He was inquisitive about our trek and frankly was more conversational than the cookie lady we visited yesterday.  He has friends that sometimes help him with the lemonade stand and they call themselves The Lemoneighbors. How cute is that?  He got the Math Wiz award for 4th grade if I recall correctly. If they gave out an entrepreneur award for 4th grade, I would nominate him for that as well. I think that young man is going places. Before we left, JFK offered him a dollar if he would take his water bottle in the house and fill it with water. TheOkie and I followed suit. That young businessman made $9 in about 20 minutes with what I would guess to be very low overhead. Walking on through the town of Cheshire, we came across Sour Patch, Burrito, Gonzo, and Major. They were hanging out in the shade at an ice cream and sandwich shop just before the replica 1,235 lb wheel of cheese that Cheshire presented to President Thomas Jefferson in 1802. Normally you know we would have hit the ice cream, but the radar was looking more favorable, like we just might make it to the shelter before the rain if we hurried. We hurried. Well, we hurried the best we could given that we had a 1,700 foot climb between Cheshire and the shelter. At one point we crossed an open area and we could see the tower on top of Mt Greylock, which we will hike past tomorrow. The closer we got to the shelter, the prettier the forest became. it was steep, but it was beautiful with the fir trees and moss covered boulders. We eventually made it to the shelter about 4:30 and we beat the rain. That is not however to say that we arrived dry. Our clothes were once again soaked through with sweat. I can say that at least my feet didn’t look like cadaver feet today. When we arrived at the shelter, we met a new hiker, Right Way who started in Harper’s Ferry. Later, Kathy a section hiker arrived. The shelter is unique with two sets of bunk platforms and a loft over the front. We collected our water from the nearby stream, although we probably could have just taken it from the river that is the trail. We ate and stored our bear bags in the bear box. Now the rains have arrived and everyone is in their bunk listening to the pleasant sound of rain on the roof. Today’s miles moved our needle up to 72%. Tomorrow we will have a short mileage day so that we can experience a New England Independence Day celebration in Williamstown. That still should be enough miles for the next big milestone.","Dalton Massachusetts

It is an idea, and what an idea it is—that you can come from humble circumstances and do great things.” -Condoleezza Rice This morning one of the people in our shelter got up before 6:00 to go to the privy. We all know this because they left their phone in the shelter with a loud 6:00 alarm that kept going off repeatedly until someone found where it was coming from. So, the rest of us started moving around shortly after that. It was a great shelter that kept us dry through the overnight rains and had practically no mosquitoes. Our hike started off with about an 800 foot climb as we picked our way on the rocks sticking out of the mud to the summit of Mt Greylock. The hike up really was a beautiful area, but your focus had to be on foot placement and not looking around. Once we arrived at the summit, it seemed that someone had stolen the 93 foot tall tower, as it could not be seen through the fog from Bascom Lodge merely yards away. We went inside the lodge’s restaurant and had breakfast with Sour Patch and Burrito, who had shuttled back to the summit about the same time we reached it. Burrito is a vegetarian and I’m a meatatarian, so she gave me the bacon off her breakfast which worked out great for both of us. Although I really think I got the better end of the deal, it was bacon after all. When we walked back outside, it was lightly misting but the large War Memorial Tower was now visible.  We walked over to the impressive granite structure and went inside. The domed mosaic inside the lower level is stunning. We later climbed the 89 step spiral staircase to the observation area at the top. I’m sure that on a clear day you could see forever. Today was not a clear day. After climbing back down to the bottom, we headed back on the trail. The trail was still running with water like a small stream. Then the rains came again. Later as we were still descending, the rains picked up even more. They eventually quit, but we were all soaked either by rain or sweat at this point. A couple of miles from town we hit a long stretch of very light colored clayish mud that just might be the slickest thing we’ve walked on since the trail was frozen over, back in the Smokies. We all did a lot of sliding, and  a couple of times I did hear someone yelling, “DOWN GOES FRAZIER!” from a few steps behind. About a mile from town, we came to the big milestone of the day, 1,600 miles!  Those hundreds lift the spirits on a wet, muddy day. It really lets us know that we are making progress. We took our usual photos and had our fist bumps, then moved on. As we walked through town, we came to a little Appalachian Trail Message Center kiosk. The First Baptist Church had stocked it with cold sodas, snacks, and first aid and various other supplies. That was so kind. We stopped for a ginger ale and signed their log book. A block or two later we were at the road crossing to get picked up and shuttled to a hotel for tonight. After arranging for the shuttle, we walked down the sidewalk a few doors to a church to wait out yet another heavy downpour. When the shower ended, TheOkie and JFK moved out from under the tree we had been standing under for protection. They sat down on the lower steps of the elevated entryway. Soon, an angry woman came to the door to inform them that this building was now a private residence and they needed to get off of her steps. Maybe she never met the previous Occupant of the church building. Anyway, we all walked a few feet away to the sidewalk and stood there until the shuttle pulled up. Once shuttled to the Willows motel, we gave them virtually every piece of clothing we had, to wash and dry. We showered and napped until we got our clothes back and could go grocery shopping. We had a nice lady shuttle driver who waited on us to do our shopping and then brought us back to the motel. You know how you shouldn’t grocery shop while hungry?  Well you really shouldn’t grocery shop if you have hiker hunger and haven’t eaten in about 12 hours!  I walked out with two grocery sacks full of resupply, a big meal for tonight, and snacks as well. Another huge thunderstorm blew in when we were headed to the store. We thought that would be the end of tonight’s fireworks show, but after eating, I heard them going off in the distance. From the second story walkway, you could just see the tops of some of the bigger ones. Today’s big milestone was hitting 1,600 miles. Tomorrow we hit another big milestone. I hope you all had a great Independence Day!","Mark Noepel Shelter

That way when you criticize them, you are a mile away from them and you have their shoes.” – Jack HandeyAfter stuffing myself with the out of control grocery store goodies, I slept great. This morning we slept in a bit and then I ate more of my bounty while packing up. We then went to the Willows Motel’s breakfast which was actually spectacular. They had so many different fresh fruits and my personal motel favorite, English muffins. The owners shuttled us back to the trail and we headed back out to the woods on a sunny day for a change. Four miles into the day, we hit our latest milestone. We crossed into VERMONT!  We have now completed 11 of the 14 states!  So long, soggy Massachusetts, hello Vermont *checks notes* Vermont, known on the AT by its nickname -VerMud. That can’t be great. Vermont wasted No time living up to its reputation. What a muddy slog!  Traveling this path of mud pits was complicated by the overgrown trail. Many times you had difficulty seeing your feet to give you a fighting chance at stepping on a rock instead of burying up in mud. Often it was difficult to get your trekking poles in front of you as you raked them through the weeds and saplings that were pressing in on you.  At one point, the mud monster grabbed my left shoe and pulled it down about six inches as my right foot had already committed to its next step. The result was a really slow motion fall forward to my knees as I struggled to keep my foot in my shoe. I’m not sure if Davy Jones’ cousin has a locker at the bottom of the endless mud where he keeps hiker’s shoes, but he didn’t get mine. Today. I really shouldn’t criticize the  Vermont trail maintainers, if there are any, as I have never walked in their shoes. In several long, pond looking sections of trail, they had actually placed rocks in the middle of the water that we could use as stepping stones. Sometimes they ran short on stones and long on water, but hey at least you knew they made an effort. We were most grateful that we were able to do this section on a day that it didn’t rain. I’m sure that it could have been worse. At the shelter there were several people that agreed that this section was one of the few that just defeated you. Oh well, we’re here for a bigger goal and things will get better. The shelter is packed tonight and there are many tents set up around it also. I’m not sure what caused people to stack up, but it was just a few days ago that the three of us had the whole shelter to ourselves. It has been fun getting to visit with thru hikers like Gonzo, Major, and Smiles that we’ve seen off and on for the last 1,600 miles as well as some Long Trail hikers that we just met.

Overnight in the shelter, someone we had not been around before yelled out a very aggressive, profanity laced tirade about snoring.  This morning, I wasn’t 100% sure if I dreamed it or it actually happened. JFK  asked me about it as we were walking. Then when we caught TheOkie, we asked him about it. So it definitely happened. The other funny thing about it was that neither TheOkie nor I had heard any snoring, so that led us to both wonder if we were each the one he was yelling about. Our other guess is that he was just talking/yelling in his sleep. He was gone when I got up this morning and we haven’t seen him since. 
We were hiking by 7:00 this morning. My second day hiking in Vermont was more enjoyable than my first. Don’t get me wrong, the trail still had its warts, with mud puddles and water streaming down the trail, but they set the bar so low yesterday and anchored my expectations to the bottom, that by comparison the trail was better. 
Starting out, the trail was just like yesterday, but the farther we went the more the mud was spaced out and there was less water in the trail.  Maybe they just want to discourage people from Massachusetts from walking into their state.  By the afternoon, it seemed that the mud monster had crusted over and was no longer interested in stealing shoes. 
We had over 4,000 feet of climbing again today and with the humidity, it was a tough day. We descended and climbed so many stone steps near Bennington. We hiked through a pretty forest in the Glastonbury Wilderness, but still haven’t had many actual view spots. 
We stopped in at the Goddard Shelter to get water from their spring and eat a snack. Most of our water lately has been from streams, which is fine, but there really is a taste difference when we get a nice mountain spring. Shortly after leaving that shelter, we came to a fire tower. It was a beautiful day, but the tower was locked up and had signs to keep us out. 
We have all been super thankful to have two dry hiking days. About 30 minutes out from tonight’s shelter, the sky darkened and JFK pulled up the radar.  A storm was headed our way. About a mile out, JFK felt a raindrop and we picked up the pace. At the end of an 18 mile day, we were flying down the mountain and made it in before the rain. When I went down to the creek to get water and wash the salt and mud off of me, the first round of rains hit. We are really glad to be inside the shelter and dry. Hot Lips and her husband Caveman are tenting by the shelter, as is Pointman. 
Today’s miles pushed the needle to 74% of the trail completed. We got to hike for a second day without being rained on, which is a bigger deal that it probably seems like it should be. Finally, if you compare the trail today to the trail yesterday, and not to previous states we’ve hiked, it was a better day.","Congdon Shelter

We were up super early this morning. The shelter was packed with people sleeping under the bunks and picnic table. The last two shelters have had a very curious design with bunk platforms wider than one person would need, but not quite wide enough for two people. They also have had a built in picnic table in the middle of the shelter.  This takes up lots of room and is not very practical because the seating would be in someone’s bed. 
We packed up and left as quietly as we could and were hiking shortly after 6:00. I would say that the trails started out marginally better than yesterday. Still mud to dodge and water to negotiate, but maybe spread out a bit more. Later in the day we actually had a stretch of trail without mud which caused JFK to comment how nice it was to walk normal trail. 
We had the biggest climb that I can remember in the last several states. It was about a 1,700 foot climb up Stratton Mountain in a very short distance. It was really hard because it was steep climbing on a very humid day, but it was even harder because of dodging mud and navigating wet rocks. The great thing is that at least there was a payoff. 
There is a fire tower on top of Stratton Mountain that was open to climb. We climbed the breezy stairs to the enclosed top where we were treated to our best views in Vermont, by far. 
Much like yesterday, there were afternoon thunderstorms building, so we started down the mountain our final 3.2 miles to our shelter. We hiked quick, but didn’t feel the need to run down the mountain like yesterday. We arrived at the shelter around 2:00 and claimed our spots. There are ten built in bunk platforms and a large loft area over covered benches and a regular picnic table. 
We walked back down to a small stream to gather water and wash off a bit. When we got back to the shelter, we took a short but well deserved nap. 
Pointman arrived just a few minutes before the first downpour. Next the caretaker of the shelter arrived during a downpour. He visited with us a bit and said that he and a few others had been trimming the overgrown trail down by the Massachusetts border. He said that the trail down there was an embarrassment. I told him how much we appreciated them maintaining the trails. 
We had dinner about 4:00, my third day in a row of eating precooked bacon, grape tomatoes, and mayonnaise packets wrapped in a tortilla. I think this is definitely something that I will continue eating when I’m back in the real world. I also finished off any extra snacks that I don’t need for tomorrow, since tomorrow we will get to town to resupply. 
Then Remington showed up just before another downpour. I brushed my teeth and JFK put our bear bags in the bear box for the night. Then Seinfeld showed up during probably the biggest downpour.  Since then a steady stream of thoroughly soaked hikers has made their way to the shelter. 
TheOkie, JFK, and I are all so glad to have been fortunate enough to hike three straight days without getting rained on while hiking. Hopefully the streak will stay alive, but either way I can only imagine the bottomless mud pits we will encounter after this much rain.","Kid Gore Shelter

The overnight rains reinvigorated the mud monster as you might expect. The worst of it was early in the morning near where we started. The trail did actually improve later in the day. It was another very humid day and after putting our damp clothes on this morning, it didn’t take very long until they were totally soaked through. About halfway into our hike, we took the short side trail to Prospect Rock, one of the few views we’ve had in the state. When we arrived, the view was totally white, foggy clouds, but by the time we left, we could begin to see the tops of mountains appearing across the valley. We continued hiking until we had to cross the busy three lanes of Vermont Route 11/30. Once safely across, we reached three great locals doing trail magic. The cold Gatorade and snacks was greatly appreciated. After visiting a while, Josh offered to give us a ride into Manchester Center since we were needing to go resupply for the next few days. He was so kind to load us and Seinfeld into his nice clean car even though we were all wet and smelly. He pointed out the supermarket and then dropped us off at the McDonald’s across the street. We all ate our fill and then headed down to the grocery store. On the way, there was a bagel shop, so we did have to stop in for a bagel first. Due to being fairly full when I got to the grocery store, I controlled my food impulses much better than I did last time. At least I didn’t walk out of there with two full grocery bags. We stood outside the grocery store and got rid of all of the packaging from our food. I’m sure we were quite a sight and we got a lot of looks in this tourist town. When kids would stare at us, JFK would tell them to be sure and stay in school. When we finished repackaging all of our food into our bear bags. JFK asked if we wanted to hitchhike back to the trail. I thought it might be difficult for three of us, so I mentioned trying to get a shuttle. About ten seconds later, Bill walked out of the grocery store and asked if we would like a ride back to the trail. Yes, we would!  That was more great trail magic and just another example of us being taken care of. The people of Vermont have been so kind and we really appreciate it.  Back on the trail, we had two miles to get to our shelter tonight. It was uphill and caused us to soak our sun dried clothes again, but the grade was pretty gentle and the mud wasn’t nearly as bad as earlier. Turtle Toes and Yard Sale are the only other hikers at the shelter so far tonight.  This makes the fourth consecutive day that we have finished our hike without getting rained on.

Against the odds and with a few bouts of thunder, we finished our fifth consecutive day of hiking without getting rained on. We woke up at 5:30 to get an early start in an attempt to beat the upcoming rains that have been triggering flood warnings. We also wanted to arrive at the shelter early enough to get a spot inside. 
We were hiking around 6:30 and started off with a climb up to the top of Bromley Ski Mountain. At the summit, we were again in a totally foggy cloud with no views. We could barely make out the gondola at the unloading station a few yards away. There is a building at the summit that hikers can stay in. We saw Branch there getting ready to start her day. 
After Bromley, we climbed Styles Peak.  We had over 1,800 feet of climbing in about our first two hours on trail and about 3,300 feet of climbing overall. The final peak we climbed, Baker Peak, was topped with large rock slabs at about a 45° angle that we had to make our way up. I definitely would not want to climb that in the rain!  We had heard some loud thunder for some time as we approached the climb to the summit. I told JFK and TheOkie that I was glad that lightning was my number one fear and not thunder, or else I might not have made the trip to the top. 
For the most part, the trails were better again today than they were yesterday. Some stretches, we actually felt like we had our old hiking rhythm back. 
When we arrived at the shelter, Veggie was there. As we walked down to the beautiful pond to get our water, Tailwind showed up. We’ve been a bit spoiled on our water collection. Today I had to make sure not to scoop up a minnow or the salamander that were swimming nearby. I guess the Katadyn filter would have strained them out, but they probably wouldn’t appreciate it. 
Now the lightning and rains have hit and the shelter is filling up. Looks like a nap and then supper before an early bedtime. If we really get the predicted flooding, this shelter could be our home again tomorrow night.

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666684,"“Whenever I’m about to do something, I would think ‘would an idiot do that?’ and if they would, I do not do that thing.” -Dwight SchruteIt is not an exaggeration to say that it rained all night long. It is only a small exaggeration to say that a morning trip to the privy could have ended with you being washed down the trail and into the quickly rising Little Rock Pond. Our options appeared to be either stay warm and dry in the shelter for another day or hike on the flooded trail and in the pouring rain to get to a road crossing and get a shuttle into Rutland, Vermont. We opted to move forward. We hadn’t even made the short walk from the shelter to the main trail before our shoes were completely soaked.  When we reached the trail at the spot we had gathered our water from, just yesterday, trees and rocks that we had stood on were under water. As the trail followed the shore of the pond for a while, raging water was running off the hillside and emptying into the pond. We had to be careful that we were not also emptied into the pond. For the first time since entering Vermont, I don’t think we saw any mud on the trail. They cleverly hid it under about eight inches of water. The trick to hiking today was looking for the light colored rocks under the water on the trail and stepping on those. When you chose poorly and stepped on light colored mud, you might sink to your calf. When the trail turned uphill, it was very much like climbing a waterfall. When going downhill, you had to be very careful to keep your feet from sliding out from under you. I know this first hand as I forgot the lesson about wet rocks being slippery. I slid all the way down to my back when stepping down a rock. I don’t think any of us were spared a fall today, but none of us were hurt. We did actually pass through the prettiest stretch of Vermont we have seen so far. The White Rocks area has a couple of “Rock Gardens” where people have balanced the various shaped white rocks into towers, some very artistically. The area is one of the nice green moss carpeted areas amid some kind of spruce or fir type trees. A mile and a half past that is where the real excitement of the day started. We had crossed some swollen creeks that were a bit sketchy, but we were not prepared for what we saw when we got to Bully Brook. What some hiker friends had crossed over two days ago with dry feet, by stepping rock to rock, had transformed into a good candidate for white water rafting. We looked a bit upstream, but didn’t see anything that could safely be crossed. Only an idiot would cross that river there and not being idiots, we decided not to cross. We backtracked uphill to where we had seen a blue blazed side trail leading to White Rocks Recreation Area parking lot. There was still a heart stopping creek crossing to get there, but we all arrived safely. Once there, TheOkie went to work finding us a shuttle and lodging. that was no easy task with pruned fingers and raindrops hitting his phone screen, causing it to have a mind of its own. Soon, Branch showed up. We had passed her earlier and were very glad that she had also figured out the best way to get to safety. Thirty minutes later, Tom, a great shuttle driver was there to pick us up. He had us just throw our packs in the back and jump in his very nice car. We looked like three drowned rats, but he said that was just fine. He was a lot of fun on the drive to town and said that he had shuttled up to 450 hikers in a year. He dropped us at the front door of the Days Inn for $10.00.  Unbelievable. He said he doesn’t do it for the money, and that is obvious. Once situated in our rooms, it was hot shower time. That was a great shower. JFK rented a car and we went out for a late lunch. Being in New England, I had to try a lobster roll. It was great, but I could have eaten four of them. Afterwards we went to the grocery store where I walked out with everything in one bag this time. Later we went to the laundromat so we will have clean, dry clothes at least until we get back on trail. A quick stop at McDonald’s for a couple of McDoubles and we were back to the hotel for the night. We will ZERO at least tomorrow. We were probably due a day off to clean up, eat town food, and charge all of our devices anyway. We hope we are able to safely get back on trail soon. The national news is all about the unprecedented flooding, washouts, and mudslides in the area. The ATC is suggesting hikers get off trail and get to safety, so we’ll see how long it takes to get back out there and knock out these last three states. The shortened miles didn’t move the needle, but for today, we can all just be thankful that we are not idiots.","Little Rock Pond Shelter

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666736,"“Follow your heart, but take your brain with you.”You would think that a ZERO day in a hotel would mean sleeping in. That usually works, unless the hotel’s fire alarms start blaring about 6:30, which was the case today. After feeling that the door wasn’t hot and opening it to see if I could smell smoke, which I couldn’t, I felt pretty safe. A bit annoyed, but safe. We got dressed and walked downstairs where Northstar and Stairmaster were still casually having the hotel’s waffle breakfast. After a brief visit I walked out front where JFK was visiting with a couple of thru hikers we hadn’t met on trail. In just a few minutes a fire engine rolled into the parking lot. After they had a chance to inspect the hotel, JFK & I went inside and had breakfast.  We would love to be on trail and moving closer to our ultimate goal, but we felt that it was the smart thing to do, to give the flood waters another day to recede. Since we were taking a ZERO day and JFK had a car, we drove to the post office in Norwich, Vermont to pick up a replacement trekking pole section that I had shipped there. I had snapped the tip off, I think in Pennsylvania. Since then, it has slowly ground down to where it was eating away at the actual pole. With the historic flooding the last couple of days, many roads were closed due to washouts and mudslides. JFK picked his way through and around the obstacles, flooded roads, and detour signs and we we eventually made it to Norwich, where I got my pole.  Just up the block from the post office was Dan & Whit’s. JFK had told us about it for months, so we finally got to go there. It has everything from a deli to hardware to kitchen gadgets to toys. Quite the one stop shop. Leaving there, we drove across the Connecticut River bridge into New Hampshire and through the Dartmouth campus. That was my first time to be in New Hampshire, and we will be walking that same route in less than a week. We stopped at Lou’s Restaurant and Bakery for a great lunch of bacon, eggs, potatoes, French toast with real, local maple syrup, and a large blueberry muffin. Then we drove back the much longer, but less risky route to Rutland. I had a text from Northstar who got back on trail today. She and Stairmaster had made it to their shelter on Killington, but had to figure out some road walks to get around flooded rivers. Her updates will be helpful to us these next few days. When we returned, I had a few snacks snd made a few phone calls. Then it was time to go to dinner and get our final resupply items. We went to The Yellow Deli. It is both a restaurant and a hiker hostel. It has quite a reputation on the trail. The root beer on tap and the sandwich were both good and we got out of there without joining anything. Next it was three stops to find the precooked bacon that I’m addicted to. That will be my supper for the next four nights and I’ve got JFK on the bacon bandwagon now, too. I sadly also had to pick up a new headlamp as the one I like so much got water in it while hiking in the pouring rain. It was in the same hip belt pocket it has been in since Georgia, but this rain was apparently too much. I’ll carry it a few days to see if it returns to life before I get rid of it. Now it’s time to pack up and eat the rest of my snacks. We plan to restart our adventure at 7:30 in the morning, as long as we feel it is safe to do so.","Rutland, Vermont

With no new rain yesterday, we felt that the water levels would be back down enough to get on trail today. We were up about 6:30, returned the rental car about 7:30, got picked up by Tom, the awesome shuttle driver about 8:00, and were on the trail about 8:30. To welcome us back, the trail started off with a 45 minute climb up yet another Bear Mountain. 
The trail was actually quite nice for the most part today. I think in some areas, the flood waters swept away the mud and eroded the trail down to a firmer level. One exception was a long stretch where the trail was about a foot wide, shallow water running through it, and closed in by vegetation. In an attempt to keep my feet dry as long as possible, I was straddling the wet trail as I walked. Shortly thereafter, my legs were stinging fiercely. JFK took a picture of the vegetation we were brushing up against and it turned out to be Canadian nettle. First the Canadians sent us wildfire smoke and now they are sending us nettles. It’s as if Canada does not want me to thru hike the AT!  
Vermont actually gave us a couple of views this morning. The trail popped out at an overlook where you could see the Rutland airport with the rows of mountains in the background. It was a great site on our clear day. Next, we came to the Clarendon Gorge Suspension Bridge.  Man we were so thankful for that.  The water was still roaring through there today. You could see where the water had been much higher the last few days, leaving countless trees and debris in its path. 
When we emerged from the bridge to the parking area, we saw Turtle Toes and Yard Sale. They were with Sarah, a local trail angel that was out providing trail magic. When we told her our names, she said she had seen us on Trailjournals and knew JFK’s name before he could tell her. She said during the long winters up here that she will watch a lot of AT videos and read a lot of Trailjournals. We were so appreciative of the ice cold Pepsi, the good conversation, and the information about the local area. She also introduced us to Hoss Cartwright who was across the parking lot with trail magic of his own. 
We eventually left, crossed the highway and train tracks and were hit with a 500 foot climb in the first half mile, up to the Clarendon Lookout. That was some steep rock to climb to the top of that. 
Later we had a couple of road crossings. At one crossing, they had posted maps of road walks to avoid fording a couple of swollen streams. We walked to the Stone’s Throw Farmstand where JFK had a maple seltzer and we filled our water bottles. We sat on their porch a few minutes while we had a snack and then eventually met Turtle Toes and Yard Sale again and all took the road walk around the river fords. 
Just before we all arrived at the Governor Clement shelter, there was one unavoidable creek crossing. We switched to our water shoes and waded across the cold water that was about calf deep. While in the water, we took the opportunity to wash the day’s mud off of our legs and then walked the rest of the way in to camp. 
Now we are all set up in the very deep and dark shelter. We’ve gathered our water and are ready for dinner. There is no signal tonight, so I’ll have to post from the top of Killington in the morning. 
Today’s miles moved the needle to 77%. The bigger milestone today is that we are officially under 500 miles from Mt Katahdin! We will have another big milestone early in the morning tomorrow. 
We expect rain tomorrow, we can’t sit it all out. We have to be smart about moving on and choosing the safe routes when available.","White Rocks Recreation Area

We knew we had a big day coming up, so we started getting ready around 5:30 and were on the trail a bit after 6:30. Turtle Toes and Yard Sale were getting off trail today to celebrate their anniversary, so we said our goodbyes and headed out. 
Just over a mile into our day, we hit the 1,700 mile mark!  It is great to have that many trail miles behind us. We took our customary photos, had our fist bumps, and then got back after it. 
The next order of business was to climb Killington Peak, Vermont’s second highest peak and the largest ski resort in the northeast. That was a smooth 2,000 foot climb right out of the gate, but not the hardest climb on this day with over 5,300 feet of climbing. 
As we approached the top of Killington, we were in a beautiful spruce forest. When we popped out by the chairlift platform we were treated to some great views of the mountains with clouds settled in the valleys. 
Near Kent Pond, we stopped in to the office of the Gifford Woods State Park. JFK had read that they had refreshment there, and after a hard ten miles, we needed refreshing. When we arrived, the lady asked us if we would like a pop. We all certainly did. She quickly emerged with three freezer pops and even cut the end off of the little plastic tubes. I had orange. We also emptied our trash, refilled our water bottles, used their restroom, and I took advantage of the opportunity to wash the mud off of my calves. 
With over ten miles left to go, we headed back out on the trail. About 16 miles into our day, we took the short side trail to Thundering Falls. With all of the recent rains, it really was roaring. 
After a short boardwalk we began the hardest climb of the day. It may have only been about 1,100 feet of climbing, but at the end of a day we had walked over 20 miles, it hurt. We just had to keep putting one foot in front of the other. We did just that and eventually arrived at our shelter. 
When we arrived, there were three spots left. We quickly set up our bags and then went to gather water. Where we collected water might be a very exciting creek crossing in the morning if the rain predictions hold true. 
We quickly ate dinner then got in bed. About that time the rains hit and it is currently dripping on me through the roof. Not ideal. The shelter is packed, but I’ll see if I can bend around the raindrops somehow. Todays miles moved the needle to 78%.

All I have needed Thy hand hath provided—  Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!”
Last night I went to sleep dodging raindrop leaking through the roof and onto me. It was raining hard and I kept thinking back to Monday and how all the trail was a river and Bully Brook was impassable. Well I don’t know how long it rained, but it didn’t rain all night. The raindrops we heard hitting the roof this morning were just dripping off of the trees overhead. The creek crossing right off the bat was a rock hop with dry feet which was a great start. 
The weather was great all day and the trail was the best we’ve had in Vermont. I mean there were still some muddy sections like you would expect after a big rain in a normal state, but great trail by Vermont standards. It really seemed miraculous and I want to thank all of the people that have been praying for us on this adventure. 
We started hiking a bit after 7 and quickly came to an iconic spot where there is an aluminum extension ladder affixed to a sheer rock outcropping. With the help of the ladder, we made our way down off of the rock and were moving again. 
After about ten miles, we stopped in Winturri Shelter to get water and have a snack. After leaving there, we came to another road walk posted, to avoid a section of washed out trail and a washed out bridge from this week’s flooding. The walk was really quite scenic through the Vermont countryside. 
When we came to the main road, we saw a sign with a giant ice cream cone on it. How is that for fate?  Of course we stopped. I was able to try one of the local delicacies, a Maple Creemee. The maple flavored soft serve ice cream cone was quite tasty. I also couldn’t resist an oversized apple cider donut as well. It also was delicious. 
Fueled up, we walked the .4 miles down the highway toward the trail. Before we got to the trailhead, we came to a Farm Stand. Well, we do like to support small businesses, so we went in. I had a Coke, Turkey sub with fresh tomatoes and lettuce, and a blueberry pastry. More fuel for our big day. 
When we climbed back up into the woods, we walked past areas with extensive networks of tubing running from tree to tree. This is where they gather the maple sap to make their famous maple syrup. 
Next we came to a large creek crossing that had a cable strung across it to hold on to as you ford the stream. The stream wasn’t as out of control as Bully Brook was on Monday, but it was flowing quite aggressively. I had remembered reading the Trailjournal entry of Blue, who is about 100 miles ahead of us. When he got to this spot, he had found a sort of logjam above the water and crossed safely on that. We went downstream a bit and crossed over on the pile of logs. 
From there, we had miles to go and lots of climbing still. We walked through some beautiful spots including an old stone wall lined forest road in an area full of huge old trees without much undergrowth. The green moss and occasional ferns really stood out against the dark rust of the forest floor of pine needles.  
We also walked through several meadows that were overgrown to the point of not being able to see your feet, and in some places, it was growing over head high.  A weed eater would be of great assistance to the hikers. 
We didn’t get into camp until almost 6:30, which is quite late by our standards. We weren’t sure if there would still be any room in the shelter at that point. When we turned the corner at the shelter, there was no one in it. So as of now it is just the three of us, and the mosquitoes,  and one mouse, in the shelter tonight. 
Today’s 22.2 miles and over 6,000 feet of climbing have to be right up there at the top of the list of our biggest days. On top of the huge day yesterday, we are pretty worn out. Our miles today moved the needle to 79%. We have a huge milestone coming up tomorrow!  But for today, I am very thankful for the great weather, the great trail, the great treats, great friends to share the adventure with, and the ability to conquer these challenging days!","Stony Brook Shelter

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666888,"“Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt.” - John MuirThis morning we were in no particular hurry since it was a shorter day. JFK headed out about 7 with a plan of meeting us at Dan & Whit’s in Norwich. TheOkie and I started walking about 7:15. We had another day of great weather. For the most part, the trails were good, for Vermont, today. We did cross several overgrown fields again which makes my skin crawl thinking of all the happy chiggers and ticks out there. So far, none of us have had a tick bite, which is great. We are all using permethrin on our clothing and shoes. We leapfrogged Luna and her human, Jukebox a few times today. Once when we were stopped to get water and have a snack, I shared my peanut butter crackers with the dog. I suspect she also has hiker hunger as she seemed very appreciative. As I was hiking, I noticed that my mustache still smelled like maple from my maple creemee yesterday. Having never had a mustache before, I’m not sure what the trick is to eating a soft serve ice cream cone without getting it all up in the mustache. I kept wiping it with napkins as I ate, but obviously that didn’t work. Oh well, based on conversations with my wife, I think it will be a short term problem once I finish the trail. We had more stream crossings today, but all were successfully navigated by rock hopping with the occasional log assisting the process. When we emerged from the woods to begin the last few miles of road walking into Norwich, we stepped right into some great trail magic that had just been set up. Skittles hiked the first 300 miles of the trail earlier this year. He was in town for a Dartmouth class reunion, so he gathered several friends and they set up a table full of goodies and some chairs for the hikers. I had a Coke, some watermelon, a banana, and a bag of skittles in honor of our host. This fueled us on into town where we met up with JFK. We had a bit more road walking, but this was a pretty exciting road walk. We walked the bridge over the Connecticut River and halfway across we stepped into New Hampshire!  We survived the mud, the flood, and the bugs of Vermont and completed our 12th of the 14 states. We took our usual pictures and had our fist bumps, but we were also joined by my new friend Luna and her human for the occasion. Next we walked from the river, up the hill into Hanover. As we entered Hanover, we also entered Dartmouth College. We took a right on Main Street and stopped in at Lou’s Restaurant and Bakery again. We got a table inside and went to work uploading our new map section and securing a place to stay tonight. Then the hard part was finding a way to get to our hotel. The busses don’t run on the weekends, Uber didn’t have any drivers, and we were unsuccessful with the shuttle drivers we attempted to contact. Our awesome waitress, Leah came to our rescue. It was near the 3:00 closing time and she said that if we didn’t get something worked out, she would be happy to take us. What a blessing!  Sure enough, when she was through, she loaded these three smelly hikers in her car and delivered us to our hotel. We were so appreciative. In real life, we take for granted having a car and being able to travel wherever we need to, whenever we need to. Sure, we’ve walked over 1,700 miles, but we really didn’t want to walk an extra 5 miles that we didn’t have to.  At the hotel, we were able to get out of our wet clothes and get showered. We walked to the nearby convenience store for some food, but they had closed at 4:00. So we walked to a Dunkin Donuts by the hotel and had a breakfast sandwich, donut, and a Gatorade. The rest of the evening was spent trying to figure out the logistics of the next few days with limited road crossings and obtain a shuttle driver for getting back on the trail tomorrow morning. We had been given a list of local trail angels, and finally made connections with a great one that will pick us up early tomorrow. She will drop us 17.5 trail miles past Hanover and we will hike back. My awesome wife is flying in tomorrow and will pick us up in Hanover and take us to the Airbnb that she rented for the next few days. It will be great to see her, and everyone is excited for the opportunity to slackpack a few days. Today’s big milestone was obviously entering a new state. But we also started our next to last map segment. We have now had 360,239 feet of climbing, or 68.23 miles. From the beginning of the trip, through the start of New Hampshire today, I have taken 4,250,775 steps as tracked by my phone. Yes, Mr. Muir, most of those steps have been taken on dirt.","Thistle Hill Shelter

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666948,"“Wherever you go, no matter what the weather, always bring your own sunshine.” -Anthony J D’AngeloWe woke up at the Super8, packed up our backpacks, and waited for our shuttle to the trail. Somehow, the rain forecast which was calling for more floods, had gotten even worse overnight. We checked FarOut and we had three stream crossings early in the day and two brooks with bridges to cross later, so we figured it was safe. Just before 7:30, the awesome trail angel Clare who has the cool trail name Espresso Love, pulled in to pick us up. She went to a lot of trouble to get out in the rain on a Sunday morning just to help out three strangers in need. We’ve been the beneficiaries of so much of this type of kindness on the trail. She was super knowledgeable about the area and we had a great visit on the way to our trailhead. We decided to be dropped off about 17.5 miles out and hike back into Hanover, so my wife could meet us in town. The hike started out in the predicted rain, so I started off in rain pants and jacket. When we got to our destination, who should be crossing the road but Spartacus. We visited briefly and then headed into the wet woods to start our first climb of the day up to Holt’s Ledge and then up Moose Mountain. By noon, the all day predicted rain had quit, but many areas of trail were already streams or ponds. I was able to take off my raincoat, which helped with the sweating, but opened me up to the mosquitoes. We had no hope of dry anything today, but especially no dry feet. Giving up early and accepting your fate takes the pressure off. On one particular long stretch of wall to wall soupy mud bordered by dense vegetation, the goal wasn’t to keep your feet dry, the goal was to keep your feet in your shoes. We also ran into several spots of extremely slippery mud that led to lots of gyrations to try and stay upright. At one road crossing, there was a container at the edge of the trail. We opened it up and there was a note that said, “I know that you’ve had it hard with all of the rain, but you’re doing great.”  Also in the container were ziplock bags filled with large squares of delicious crumb cake that were still warm from the oven. Man, did that hit the spot on a rainy day, just more great trail magic. One nice thing about hiking south every now and again, is running into hikers you know. Today we got to visit with Black Beard from New Orleans, Major, Smile, Pointman, and Aileron. Once we reached town, the trail came out right at the Dartmouth baseball fields. As we walked through town, we came up on a really cool mural of the New England section of the trail. As we were admiring it, we heard someone yelling to us to come have some snacks. It was Gone-Zo and Chickadee. We stopped there and had a seat and some chips.  Angela had tracked me there and it was really great to see her when she arrived!  The hikers walked the last half mile to where we had ended yesterday’s hike at Lou’s, and Angela picked us up there. We then took a quick trip to L.L. Bean to pick up some DEET, to deal more harshly with those mosquito devils.  After that we headed to a nice Italian restaurant. On the way there, we had spied the Dairy Twirl with people lined up outside. So we had to head there for the most important meal of the day. Finally it was the long, winding drive to our home for the next few days in North Woodstock. Today’s miles moved the imaginary needle to the big 80% mark. If you notice, all of the numbers starting with 80 are in red. That’s because there is a popular saying about the AT, that when NOBO’s have done 80% of the trail, they have done 20% of the work!  That’s how hard these last two states are.  So it was another great day on the AT. Even though it rained quite a bit, we brought our own sunshine. My day was even brighter when my amazing wife flew across the country to be with me and support our hike.","Hanover, New Hampshire

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666980,"“When thro' the woods and forest glades I wander, And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur, And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze:
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee;  How great Thou art, how great Thou art!  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee;  How great Thou art, how great Thou art!”Today was a great day for many reasons. First was having my wife with me, in a clean, dry place to stay, with access to showers and laundry, indoor plumbing,  transportation, and good food. Honestly, things that I take for granted in the real world, but have a greater appreciation for,  after almost 1,800 miles of trail life. Also it was great weather all day long and I got to spend the day outdoors in a beautiful place. Additionally it was a great day because I got to climb a mountain, and in doing so, I wandered, heard, saw, and felt every single item mentioned in the song above that is today’s quote. I’ve climbed a lot of mountains through the years, and there is just something about standing above tree line looking off into the vast distance that makes my soul sing the praises of the Creator of all of this rugged beauty. The climb to the top was hard, but I thank God that I have the ability and desire needed to experience the grandeur of His creation. Expecting great weather today, we decided to climb Mt Moosilauke. We were able to slack pack it, climb it southbound, and do it out of order. It doesn’t get much more non traditional than that. When we arrived, we saw Snickers in the parking lot. She said that her husband, Aileron had just started about 15 minutes ahead of us. After giving us all a snicker bar and a hug, we were off. As we entered the woods, we were met with a pretty big water crossing. There were rock tips sticking up slightly out of the water and TheOkie just hopped right across weaving his way on the rocks that I was wishing were a bit closer together. Eventually we all made it across with dry feet. Then the real fun began. The climb to the top was about 3,000 feet of elevation gain with the bulk of it right beside the spectacular Beaver Brook waterfall. That was a lot of stepping up from rock to rock or occasionally stepping on small wooden blocks bolted to the sheer rock face. We eventually popped out of the trees above the tree line and followed the cairns up the rock lined path to the summit. This one climb took TheOkie and me just under 2 1/2 hours to reach the top. We took pictures with the summit sign. Then I put on a long sleeved shirt and we sat behind the protection of some stacked rocks to have a snack, admire the views, and wait for David, JFK, and Aileron to reach the summit. We also saw Jo, Kerry, and their dog Felix at he top. I am amazed that the dog is able to climb all of those boulders and rock faces. Before we headed lower, some low clouds blew in and the temperature dropped to the low 60’s. As we got lower, the temperature started warming up. When we stopped at a stream to get more water, I put the long sleeved shirt away. The rest of the hike was less eventful. There was plenty of mud to avoid after yesterday’s rains and we did have to switch to our water shoes and ford one calf deep creek. At our next to last road crossing, Angela met us with some much appreciated trail magic to fuel us the last five miles. A couple of hours later she was picking us up and taking us out for ice cream. Then we stopped by a small market for snacks on the way to the condo. Once we arrived, she prepared us a deliciously filling meal of chicken and dumplings, corn in the cob, broccoli, peas, cinnamon apples, and crescent rolls. She is doing her part to try and get some of our weight back on us. We saw lots of our hiking friends again today, some going north and some going south. We saw Encore, Cruise Control, Aileron, Northstar, Stairmaster, Pointman, Hot Lips, Caveman, Blackbeard, Spartacus, Jo, Kerry, and Felix.  Today’s miles pushed that needle up to the 81% mark. It was a hard percent, but very worth it. If you ever get to wander through the beautiful forests or even better, climb a lofty mountain, I highly recommend that you do it.  It just might make your soul sing.","Kinsman Notch

We were doing our last day of southbound slackpacking to fill in the 21 mile section we had skipped over, between Mt Moosilauke and our Sunday hike north of Hanover. We were expecting two bouts of rain around 2 and 5. We had climbs up Mt Cube and Smarts Mountain on the agenda with right about a mile of ascents on the day.   The two o’clock rain actually came an hour early. We had been on the top of Mt Cube having a snack and visiting with the dozens of teenage campers from Camp Walt Whitman. Some of them actually thought TheOkie had an accent. We got moving down the rock slabs which were wet with condensation. Before I knew it, the slippery, wet rocks got me again. I fell forward and landed on my knee. I didn’t get any blood on the rocks and all body parts seemed to be working, so we hiked on. We stopped at a stream crossing to collect water and all of a sudden, it was raining like a firehose. I got my raincoat out and on as quickly as I could but my shorts were totally soaked. Within an hour, the rains quit and we stopped to shed the raincoat.  It was pretty slow going today between dodging mud puddles and being cautious coming down rocks. We were actually walking for almost 11 hours. On Smarts Mountain, we were able to climb to the top of the fire tower. You could see the rows of mountains surrounding us, but the views were a bit smoky / foggy. The trails were still suffering a bit from all of the recent rains. Most places we were able to navigate around the mud puddles and ponds, but not all of them. Late in the day, we came to a watery mud puddle that was probably seven or eight feet across and tightly bound by a dense stand of young spruce trees. Water extended off into the woods and there was just no way to get around it. At one time there had been two boards crossing the water, but they had rotted away except for about a foot on each end that were partially submerged in the muck. Probing with our trekking poles, there wasn’t much of a bottom to the mud for a while. I stood on the partially submerged board and leaned out far into the puddle and planted my trekking poles on the least un-solid spots I could find. Then with all of the standing broadjump skills I could muster, I vaulted myself across the mud puddle and actually landed my left foot on the remnants of the rotted board. That was great for my left foot, but my right foot was not so lucky. There was no rotted board remnant to catch it and it immediately splashed and sank over my gaiter, sock, and shoe. Both legs ended the day as a muddy mess. 
We saw a few more NOBO’s that we knew today, including Jukebox and Luna. As we were two miles out from our pickup point, we started to hear the rumbling thunder. The race was on. Once we got off of the last rock slabs, we cruised over the dark trail. Angela was there waiting on us and luckily we got in the car just as the second wave of rain hit. We were tired and hungry, but so happy to beat the rain. Angela, being the great trail angel and supporter of the team, had cold sodas and salty snacks waiting on us in the car. We really appreciated that!  We headed to Hanover to get real food and went to Ramunto’s Brick Oven Pizza. The large slices of pizza were great. Before we left, Yard Sale and Turtle Toes came in. We had a nice visit with them and were able to introduce Angela to them. Then it was the long, winding car ride to North Woodstock. The car wasn’t smelling too fresh with all of the wet shoes and socks aboard. When we got to the condo, I threw clothes in the laundry and then had a great hot shower. Our imaginary needle hopped up to the 82% mark. But more importantly, today we hit the big 1,800 mile milestone!  We only have 389.6 miles left to the summit of Mt Katahdin!!  It is starting to seem closer and closer. For ten years, I’ve dreamed of standing on the sign atop Katahdin. But now we’re putting in the work to make the dream more than a dream.","NH Route 25C

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667059,"“Camping is not a date; it’s an endurance test. If you can survive camping with someone, you should marry them on the way home.”
Today was a well deserved and very productive zero day. We got to sleep in a little bit later than usual, and then I had a ZOOM meeting. Afterwards, we formulated our plan for the White Mountains, our next section of trail. 
We will be staying in several Appalachian Mountain Club huts along the trail in the coming week. There is limited availability, but we were able to arrange them for four of the next six days. They include a bunk space, supper, and breakfast the next morning. This will reduce the amount of food that we will have to carry over this seven day stretch through the hardest part of the trail. That is good, since we typically only carry about three days worth of food. 
We were helped greatly by our friend Aileron, who had been through the scheduling and reservation process a few days ago. He will be at the huts a day ahead of us. It is quite tricky balancing the availability on your desired days against the spacing of the huts and your realistic abilities to cover miles in the Whites. In fact, one of our requested reservations brought on some questions from the AMC lady that knows more about the White’s than we ever will. I’m sure all of the days will be exhausting, but for one of the days she included a note for the hut staff to hold our dinner for a late arrival. 
After getting that bit of logistics out of the way, it was off to Sugar Hill, New Hampshire to Polly’s Pancakes for a great lunch based on the recommendation of a friend. The drive over was filled with views of the mountains we will climb in the coming week. Afterwards, we went to North Conway for a stop at REI and a grocery store to resupply. Between the two, we managed to squeeze in a choco dipped strawberry blizzard at the nearby Dairy Queen for the most important meal of the day. 
For the drive home, we also took a friend’s recommendation and drove the very scenic Kancamagus Highway. We had lots of beautiful views of the mountains, gorgeous views of the  large, boulder filled rivers, and lots of laughs trying to remember the name of the highway. 
Back home, it was time to organize and repack all of our food. It’s a good thing we are getting so many meals at the huts, because I can barely close my bear bag as it is. I don’t want to even talk about the weight. Finally we had great burgers and fries from the local market for supper. 
Tomorrow morning my sweet wife will drop us off at the Kinsman Notch trailhead. It will be the last time I see her until the end of this long journey. I have been so blessed that she has been able to come out each month and support me. We’ve done our fair share of camping together through the years. As the quote above correctly suggests, that’s the type of person to marry. The bonus to that is that she understands this very illogical thing that I have been focused on for years and has been such a great encourager and supporter to me. 
Today there were no trail miles, but we covered a lot of miles taking in beautiful scenery that we otherwise probably never would have encountered. So, it was another great day because of the AT.","North Woodstock, New Hampshire

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667121,"“You've survived 100% of everything in your life so far, so there's a pretty good chance that you'll survive whatever is next.”
This morning, my sweet wife who has been helping us out the last few days, dropped us off at the trailhead for the last time. We were heading into the White Mountains and she was flying back home. 
We quickly started climbing and reached the tree covered summit of Mt Wolf. We later stopped for water and a snack near the Eliza Brook Shelter before the trail took us up next to some beautiful waterfalls. 
Ten miles into our day, we had finally climbed to the top of South Kinsman mountain where we had spectacular views. We could see the Mt Washington Omni resort with their red roofed buildings in the distance. It was a lot harder getting this view of it than it was when driving by it yesterday. After descending for a while, the trail turned right back up and we climbed to the top of North Kinsman mountain. Again we had stunning views of row after row of rugged mountain peaks. 
Then it was the long and treacherous descent to Lonesome Lake Hut. There were so many steeply angled rock slabs to navigate today. Some had wooden blocks bolted in and some had log ladders laying on the slabs. Many of the slabs were wet, but some of the rock actually had a rough texture to it that was helpful. 
When we arrived at the hut, we checked in. They served dinner at 6 and breakfast tomorrow morning at 7.  Dinner was great, large, and filling. We had lentil and barley soup, salad, lasagna, fresh baked bread, and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies. That really hit the spot after a hard hike. 
They also have snacks for sale, which means that we could have brought less food weight with us, if we had only known. They had a naturalist talk and a green energy talk before and after dinner. The CROO was very energetic!  
The three of us are in bunk room number 1 with room for one more person to join us, but it looks like they are far from capacity.  There is running water in the bathroom, so I took my bandanna in there and washed off my legs. 
After dinner, I visited with several other guests that had a lot of questions about a thru hike and the Appalachian Trail in general. It was fun sharing our experiences with others that were interested. 
Tomorrow is a huge day of both miles and climbs.  This is the hike that the AMC lady didn’t think we would complete before dinner time. We finished today’s hike about 4:00 and tomorrow we have 2.5 more miles and more than a mile of climbing. We really need to make it to our next hut so that we don’t start a domino chain reaction knocking out our other reservations.  
The weather will be a bigger factor than either the climb or the miles and you can’t control the weather. We’ve made it this far and whether or not we make it to our reserved hut tomorrow, I’m sure we will survive.","Kinsman Notch
",Lonesome Lake Hut,"Jul 20, Thu",13.40
McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667162,"“Man plans and God laughs.” - Yiddish ProverbWe got up from our bunks and started repacking our gear before the CROO did their morning wake up yell at 6:30. That is one energetic group of young people running the hut. We were served a large breakfast of oatmeal, scrambled eggs, sausage, and chocolate chip pumpkin bread. We ate lots to fuel us through our extremely hard day coming up. The CROO read the daily mountain weather forecast that they receive by radio from the Mt Washington observatory. They were calling for afternoon rains and possible thunderstorms, which wasn’t ideal with so many miles to go, so much climbing, and a lot of time exposed above tree line. We felt that if we could make good time and the rains held off until later in the afternoon, we could make it to the Galehead Hut before supper. We started off walking past the scenic Lonesome Lake just after 7:30 and then turned and walked downhill for almost three miles. It was mostly stepping rock to rock and boulder to boulder with occasional bog boards mixed in for the soupiest spots. About 8:00 we felt our first raindrops. We had two major brook crossings that were rock hops with consequences. I was really wishing for an extra rock in a couple of strategic places. Those water crossings got the adrenaline pumping, especially on wet rocks. We all made it across successfully and were making pretty good time down the trail, but the rain had increased to a steady downpour. We made it down to the point that the AT passes under the I-93 bridge. We stopped there, like three trolls under the bridge. We used the protection from the rain to put on rain gear and assess our situation. We had cell signal now and could see the radar and the updated rain forecast. It was clear that what would possibly be our hardest day we’ve had on trail if we had ideal conditions, would be treacherous in 2.15” of steady rain all day. If we didn’t make it to our hut tonight, we wouldn’t be able to keep any of our hut reservations. We’ve made a lot of good decisions on this trip. A lot of times we didn’t have our preferred option as one of the choices. That’s how today was. We all three decided that even though it threw things into a bit of chaos, it wasn’t safe to stick to our current plan. We made arrangements for hotel rooms for the evening and then walked out 0.9 miles on a bike trail to the Flume Gorge Visitor Center. Once we were in the dry building, we arranged a shuttle back to North Woodstock, just down the road from where we had spent several days in the condo. Although it was well before check in, the kind folks at Inn 32 cleaned our rooms and let us in early. We walked across the street to Wayne’s Market to pick up burgers for lunch.  Afterwards I showered and then took the best 2 1/2 hour rainy day nap. It was glorious and much needed. JFK spoke with the AMC folks and got our reservations arranged for huts on our new days. That changed some of the places we will stay and some of the mileages, but we feel good about the new schedule. The weather for the next week shows some rain chances, but they are around a tenth of an inch or so, unlike today’s complete washout. David and Sarah Dirrim were in the area with a car and drove us to a nice restaurant where we had a great dinner. David will pick us up early in the morning to shuttle us back to trail. That is so helpful. Even though today’s mileage was very short, it was just enough to nudge the imaginary needle up to the 83% mark. We had a good plan, but the weather had a different plan. We were in one of the few convenient locations in the White’s  to get off trail and make adjustments to our schedule. I think we again have a good plan for getting through the White’s. Ball’s in your court, weather.","Lonesome Lake Hut

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667177,"“Mountains are where heaven meets earth.” -Anita Diament
What a difference a day makes. After yesterday’s full day of rain, today was a great day on the trail. I woke up before my 6:00 alarm and started getting ready for the day. Just before 7:15, David arrived to shuttle us back to the Flume Gorge Visitor Center. After the short drive, we said our goodbyes and started up the 0.9 mile paved bike path to the AT. 
I was pleasantly surprised with what good shape the trail was in after all of the rain. Our initial climb was over 3,300 feet of elevation gain to Little Haystack Mountain. Even though it was a clear day, we were soaked to the bone. We stopped at the summit for a snack and a drink. Soon, I moved down behind a rock that blocked the cool breeze and put on my light jacket. 
As we kept walking along the Franconia Ridge, we climbed Mt Lincoln and Mt Lafayette, with its 5,246 foot summit. For years I had seen pictures and videos of the Franconia Ridge. I always felt that this was one of the most spectacular sections on the entire trail and I was not disappointed today. When we arrived, we had great views of the ridge and of the surrounding mountain ranges. By the time we reached the summit of Mt Lafayette, we were hiking in a cloud. Eventually we were sprinkled on a bit, but it never really seemed to rain. 
The climbs were quite steep, but we were generally stepping up on smaller rocks than on the climb up the Kinsman Mountains. The area below tree line was beautiful with lots of the bright green moss covering everything and a dense growth of spruce trees. The area above tree line was simply spectacular. It made my soul sing. 
Being a summer Saturday with nice weather, there were quite a few people out. There are some shorter and easier ways to access this beautiful place as opposed to the Appalachian Trail and I think that adds to the number of people out enjoying the area. When we arrived at the shelter, there were already five people in there, but it holds twelve, so we all got our spaces. 
There is a designated eating area, as per Bean, the caretaker, so we went there and finished off the snacks we didn’t eat on the way up.  Later I changed out of my damp clothes and put on my Smartwool layer, long hiking pants, and my puffy down coat. This will be the first night in a while where we will zip up our sleeping bags when we sleep.  Now it’s time for supper, so I’ll head back over to the eating area with my bacon and tomatoes. 
Today we saw Smiles and Walrus on the trail, but neither one stopped at this shelter. Our decision yesterday to wait for better weather proved to be a great one. We had a heavenly day in the vastness of God’s creation.","Flume Gorge Visitor Center

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667249,"“Mountains are earth’s undecaying monuments.” -Nathaniel Hawthorn
According to Bean, the caretaker, last night was a record number of people at the Garfield Ridge Tent Sites with 55 people paying to stay in the shelter or set up their tent there. Glad we could help. The double decker shelter was packed. At some point during the night, a very large person coming back from a trip to the bathroom without a headlamp, stepped right in my left calf. That will bring you right out of a deep sleep. I’m at a loss for how he got that confused about where he was walking. TheOkie and I were the only two spots on our side of the ladder to the upper deck and he came from that direction. Oh well, it could have been worse. 
We planned to sleep in a bit since we had a short day and wanted to stop in at Galehead Hut for a snack. The shelter was much too loud to sleep late, but we did stay in our bags and rest on the cool crisp morning. When we did get out, we had the prettiest blue skies we’ve seen in quite a while. It stayed beautiful all day. 
Unlike most days, we didn’t start out with a climb up a mountain. Instead, today we started out with a climb down a waterfall. Luckily there wasn’t a lot of water flowing over the rocks we were climbing down, but we had to go very slow and be extremely cautious with every step. 
Later, we did have a 1,500 foot climb up to the peak of South Twin Mountain that was just about straight up. It was mostly stepping up rock to rock like you were on a never-ending chunky Stairmaster. When we finally reached the top, above tree line, the 360° mountain view’s were worth all of the effort. I can’t recall when we’ve had better weather with such amazing views of endless mountains in every direction. It did truly make my soul sing again. During our brief stay on top, I was able to make a quick FaceTime call to share the views with family. After that we climbed Mt Guyot and Zealand Mountain. We popped out to several more great views above the trees. 
As we neared the Zealand Falls Hut, we crossed Zealand Falls a couple of times. The large granite falls are quite wide with water channels cut in various places and great dry rocks for sitting spread throughout. Once we checked into the hut, we walked over to the adjacent falls and sat in the sun with our feet in the frigid water occasionally. Our hiking clothes actually dried on the granite as we soaked in the sun. I eventually laid down on the warm rocks with my shoes under my head and just listened to the mighty roar of the falls as I took in the clear blue skies, while I could keep my eyes open. There was quite the drama going on near us as a young girl lost her glasses in a small channel of the falls. Causing a large group to go on a glasses search. Twice. 
Dinner was good again, especially the soup and bread. I learned from my first hut stay that they provide you scratchy wool blankets, so tonight I will be in my sleeping bag liner under the blanket. They also provide ear plugs and I’ll definitely be using those also. We are getting to bed pretty early after an absolutely awesome day among the monumental mountains on the AT.","Garfield Ridge Tentsites

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667298,"“Were the whole realm of nature mine,That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,Demands my soul, my life, my all.”What another GREAT day on the AT!  We woke up before the very unique CROO sang their morning wake-up song. We were packed up so that we could hit the trail as soon as we had breakfast. Breakfast was oatmeal with toppings, scrambled eggs with chives, pancakes, and bacon. As soon as we handed in our dishes, we were hitting the trail. We were excited about a comment we read in FarOut that said the first five miles leaving the hut would remind you what good trail was like. The comment was right and we flew down the trail. It was nice to feel the old average speed get up over 2 1/2 miles an hour again. Our speed has really slowed in Vermont and slowed even more in New Hampshire. There is a huge difference between walking in a rhythm on smooth trail and having to focus on foot placement with each step to either get up on a rock or avoid a mud puddle. Eventually we reached highway 302 and everything changed. We stopped for a snack and then crossed the highway. Just across we stopped at the Saco River to get water for the upcoming climb. The river is at 1,250 feet in elevation and we climbed to the top of Mt Webster and Mt Jackson at 4,034 feet in elevation. This climb was different than the climb up Moosilauke or the Kinsman Mountains and I actually enjoyed it more, if one can enjoy a 2,800 foot climb. Probably not the right use of that word.  There were many places where I had to hold both poles in one hand so I could use a hand to help climb up the steep rocks. We were rewarded with unbelievable views from the Webster Cliffs and then several more places on the way up. Photos just don’t capture the majesty of the mountains as you take in the 360° views of peaks for as far as you can see. It truly feels as if you are standing on top of the world. The fact that we again had beautiful sunny clear skies for these spectacular views was such a huge blessing. The fact that we were able to climb rock wall after rock wall on a dry day was a huge relief. We saw several other thru hikers today. We met Bagel and Van Gogh on top of the mountain and we saw our friends Smiles, Gone-Zo, and Dilemma at the hut. At the hut, we got to our assigned bunks and got things set up. Then it was time to try and dry out our clothes and journal before dinner at 6.  Dinner was good again with pumpkin soup, bread, chicken and chocolate cookies. After dinner I listened to the volunteer naturalist give a talk on erratics, the large boulders we see from time to time that seem out of place.

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667313,"“May your trails be crooked, winding, lonesome, dangerous, leading to the most amazing view. May your mountains rise into and above the clouds.” -Edward Abbey
It was another early morning in the Mizpah Spring Hut. We packed up before breakfast and headed out as soon as we ate. This CROO was great and their skits to remind guests to stay on the trails, pack out your trash, fold your wool blankets properly, and tip the CROO were my favorite of all the huts. 
Today was a big day, and the highlight would be climbing Mt Washington. Mt Washington is the highest Peak in the northeast and home to the worst recorded weather in the world with winds exceeding 230 mph. We were delighted to wake up to sunny skies. There were a few clouds around and the weather report said that the summit was currently in a cloud. 
Leaving the hut, we immediately climbed about 500 feet to the top of Mt Pierce. Then it was another climb of about 500 feet to Mt Eisenhower. We followed that with another climb of about 600 feet up Mt Monroe. Eventually we passed by the Lake Of The Clouds Hut. It is nestled in such a beautiful setting by two mountain lakes below the summit of Mt Washington. 
Just past the hut, there is a large, yellow, ominous sign warning people to stop and turn around if the weather is bad. It says that the area has the worst weather in America and many people have died there even in the summer. Fortunately for us, it was a beautiful day, because honestly we didn’t have a plan B. 
From there it was the final 1,250 foot climb up to the top of Mt Washington in 1.4 miles. We saw clouds leave the summit and at times, watched clouds lift and float over the peak like a white river. 
The trails were fairly crowded today and we passed lots of hikers on the way up. We finally reached the cool, windy summit and got in line to take our iconic photo at the summit sign. It is quite the complex on top. It can be reached  by cog train or auto road and there were lots of visitors taking advantage of the great day. 
There is the actual weather research and observatory complex. There is a large viewing area where people can take in the incredible views of the surrounding mountains. There is also a visitor center with a hiker lounge, snack bar, post office, and weather information desk. With a snack bar in play, obviously that’s where we headed first. I’m embarrassed to say that I only had a chili dog, hot dog, and a coke as opposed to TheOkie who had four chili dogs and a coke. We ate in the hiker lounge where we were able to empty the trash we’d been carrying in our backpacks for the last few days as well as plug in our battery banks to try and recharge them a bit. Even though we’ve been staying in the huts, there is no guest electricity or guest trash available. 
Although it was so comfortable in there, we eventually had to leave because we had miles to hike and most all of it was on exposed trail above tree line. Even though it was a great day, there’s always a chance of afternoon thunderstorms in the mountains. Especially on a mountain known for unpredictable and extreme weather. 
The 5.7 mile hike to the Madison Spring Hut was mostly downhill, but it was brutal. The rocks really took a toll on all of our feet and knees. We followed large cairns from point to point since the trail was generally indistinguishable from the other surrounding rocks. We were so glad to finally arrive at the hut. 
After a week of trying to get reservations straightened out for this hut, we walked in the door with only one solid reservation. We asked and they had a cancellation earlier in the day, so we took that spot. That still left us needing one spot. The huts have a work for stay program where they will usually take two thru hikers a day that will sweep or wipe down tables in trade for sleeping space in the dining room and leftover food. While the spots are coveted by a lot of thru hikers, they don’t accept work for stay hikers until 4:00. It was right at 4:00 when we arrived, so TheOkie inquired about one of those spots. The CROO member checking us in was super. She said that he could have the spot. A few minutes later she told him that while capacity is 50 guests, they actually have 52 bunks and keep two for emergencies. At her discretion, she was able to sell him one of those bunks for the night. She said she just couldn’t stand to think of him watching his friends eating without him. We all really appreciated her flexibility and it worked out just as we had hoped it would. 
Tomorrow we have three reservations at the Carter Notch Hut which will be our last night before we hit town again. Dinner was really good again tonight with minestrone soup, fresh baked bread, salad, rice, black bean enchiladas, and peach pie. 
The hut sits in a rugged, beautiful setting tucked below Mt Madison which we will climb to start things off tomorrow as we finish the Presidential Range. Today’s miles moved us to the 85% mark. Climbing Mt Washington is certainly one of the iconic spots on the AT. We were so appreciative to get to do it on a beautiful day.","Mizpah Spring Hut

Madison Spring Hut sits in a beautiful location .5 trail miles below the summit of Mt Madison. You essentially start the 551 foot climb to the top when you leave the porch. Not long into the climb, we popped out of the trees and it was a rock scramble following large cairns all the way to the top. It was a fairly cloudy morning, but we did have some good views and an especially nice view back down to the hut below. Coming down from Mt Madison, we had about a 3,300 foot descent. About half of it was a slow, foot shredding, knee burning test of focus. Our first 1.5 miles took us 1.75 hours. Not ideal pace on a planned 13.7 mile day. The bright spot in our descent was running into our friend Chance again. He really is just an energy spike in human form and always a wealth of trail information. He is on segment 16 of 18 of his unique thru hike where he drops his bicycle off, then drives north, then hikes south to his bicycle, then bikes north to his car. So since he is always hiking south, towards us, we are apt to see him every few weeks. Later, the trail crossed the Mt Washington Auto Road. We felt like we had walked so far from when we left Mt Washington, that we should be far away from any road leading to it, but I guess it has been more effort and less miles since then. Just before 1:00, we reached the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center 7.8 miles into our 13.7 mile planned day. I had a great fried egg and ham sandwich from their deli. As we sat and ate, we evaluated our current situation and decided that since we were at a point where we had an opportunity, we would shuttle into Gorham, New Hampshire. This will allow us to rest up, ride out tomorrow’s expected rains, and give everyone a chance to feel their best when we hit the Wildcat Mountains, one of the toughest climbs on the whole trail. We were able to move our Carter Notch Hut reservations to Friday, which was great.  Hopefully we will have good weather and get the Wildcats knocked out on a shorter day. Then we will still have a long, very hard day Saturday back into Gorham to resupply and make our plans for the next section of the trail. After shuttling into Gorham and checking in to the hotel, it felt so good to get a shower and put on clean, dry clothes.  When I get a chance, I like to read the Trailjournals of Jo, Kerry, & Felix as well as Shades of Blue, who are all hiker friends we have hiked around from time to time this year. I had just read Jo’s account of a great BBQ meal in Gorham, so tonight we walked down the street to that restaurant. I had high expectations and it far exceeded them. We each ordered the Bone-Afide Pig Pile which was a skillet of fresh cut fries topped with a heaping helping of great pulled pork and BBQ sauce, topped with three ribs. We all agreed that it was the best BBQ we’ve had on this trip. After dinner we walked to the Dollar General to get room snacks on the way back to the hotel. As we arrived, Jo, Kerry, & Felix were walking out. We stopped to tell them how much we liked their BBQ place and visited about the upcoming section of the trail for a bit. After buying snacks like an unsupervised grade schooler, we headed back across the street to the hotel for the evening. We know that we are ahead of our original timeline for finishing, so this change of plans doesn’t really set us back. We are focused on successfully finishing this adventure, so if that means changing our plans to put us in a better position, I hope that’s what we always do.","Madison Spring Hut

We went to the Italian place, but they couldn’t seat us at any of their empty tables for an hour and a half since we didn’t have a reservation. So we decided to walk the other way and went back to Road Hawg BBQ again and had the exact same thing as last night. It was still excellent. We had seen Seinfeld, Bookmark, and Ranch at the hotel earlier and told them about the great BBQ. As we were finishing our meal, they walked in. They are in for a treat. We get shuttled back to the trail at 6:45 in the morning to tackle the Wildcats. We are excited to be in the home stretch. And finally, to be clear, please don’t eat poisonous mushrooms, even once.","Gorham, New Hampshire

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667460,"“It’s not who you are that holds you back, it’s who you think you’re not.”
It was a particularly early morning at the hotel because of a scheduled 6:45 shuttle ride back to the trail. That was fine though, because we were quite well rested from our Zero day in Gorham. Once the shuttle driver remembered where he was taking us, it was a short drive to the visitor center. 
We started off excited about taking on the challenge of the Wildcats. By reputation, they are one of the most feared mountains on the trail. At some point most people put away their poles and use their hands and feet to climb up the slabs and walls leading to the ridge line at the top.  I’ve even had friends send me videos of people climbing this steep section of the trail. All of these factors lay waiting in the back of your mind. I mean it’s true that we’ve overcome every obstacle placed before us for almost 1,900 miles, but we’ve never had to face the Wildcats. 
Starting out, we kept our poles handy, which was a good idea over the rock strewn path. Eventually the trail turned sharply up. Many places the trail was an uneven staircase of large rocks, and still I found my poles handy for aiding my knees as I took the giant steps. In a few places, the trail turned to go up wet, slick slabs of rock. Generally, I was able to work my way to an edge and putting both poles in one hand, use my free hand to grab a nearby tree, a rock wall, or even the rock I was climbing, to pull myself up. 
After three miles of climbing, we made it to the top of Wildcat Peak D and could see the ski lift unloading platform. Having just climbed a bit over 2,000 feet, we took advantage of the large wooden observation platform to take a snack break. Since it was a low mileage day and we were making great time, we took off our heavy packs and sat in the sun for a while. We had two more miles of climbing to the peak of Wildcat Mountain, so we got going again. 
We met southbound thru hikers Crunk and Purple Heart at one steep wall section. We stopped and visited about what each of us could expect as we headed to where the others had come from. We also saw one of our hiking friends, Major who was slackpacking today the miles we are hiking today and tomorrow.   
Eventually we made it to the ridge line at the summit of Wildcat. I think all three of us had the same thoughts:  When do we get to the scary part?  You see, while it definitely was a strenuous climb including some vertical parts, the name and reputation may have been the scariest part of it. We honestly felt that the climb up the Kinsman Mountains and even Moosilauke were harder than today’s climb. Maybe that’s a good lesson for the rest of the scary sections that wait for us in Maine. We are overcomers of obstacles.  Don’t let doubt or fear creep into our minds. 
Once we descended into the notch where the hut is located, we stopped to check in. After getting our bunk room assignments, we went and unpacked for the night. Then back at the main building, I had a large bowl of soup, some pulled pork, and a great chunk of blueberry crumb cake. Since it was still early in the day, we went back to our bunk room and took a nice nap. 
Before dinner, we sat out front of the main building and watched a ball of four snakes sunning themselves on a rock. We visited with an Austrian southbound thru hiker for a while as we sat there looking up at the mountain he had just come down and we will start off climbing tomorrow. Another good 1,500 foot climb in the first mile coming up.  Fearless also stopped in to cook dinner in front of the hut. 
Our dinner was good and filling again, especially the fresh bread and tomato soup. We visited with a Japanese woman across the table and met another northbound thru hiker named Buck. 
Even though today was a short day, it was notable because we knocked out the Wildcats. It also marked five months since we started this journey. At dinner I showed some people a picture of us when we started. They said that we looked like different people. In many ways, we are.  Tomorrow starts another run of bigger milestones.","Pinkham Notch Visitor Center

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667495,"“Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.”  -Dwight Eisenhower  The three of us were being quiet in the bunk room this morning until we realized that the other two occupants of our bunk room had ditched us during the night. We weren’t sure if it was the sounds, the smells, or they just got a better offer.  Breakfast was good again and highlighted by a delicious blueberry coffee cake. We started out tackling a 1,500 foot climb in the first mile. We popped out several times, sometimes to views and sometimes to the white of the clouds that rolled in. The trail took us up Carter Dome, Mount Hight, South Carter Mountain, Middle Carter Mountain, North Carter Mountain, and Mt Moriah. Lots of mountains today. The climbs seemed easier on me than the descents. Finally near the end of our hike we actually got some nicely built trail. We had walked up and down huge stretches of granite. We had miles of slow going rock filled gulleys. We had many areas of bog boards today, also. At one point this afternoon when we were on top of a mountain and had a bit of cell service, we began trying to make a hotel reservation for tonight. We called several places and looked at others online and all were booked up except one room where we had stayed two nights ago for $111, which was now $399 for tonight. We hiked on and about 4:00 heard our first thunder. The forecast had called for .05” of rain starting at 4 and ending before 5. We were already well into our descent, so we weren’t concerned. As the light rain began to fall, we were approaching the Rattle River Shelter. We popped in there to evaluate our next steps. The Sisters, two very friendly section hiking sisters were in the shelter when we arrived. They ate dinner and then returned to their tent for the night. After we discussed the lack of rooms and the current rain, we decided to change our plan and stay in the shelter for the evening. We will get up early in the morning and complete the 1.9 miles to Route 2 that we planned to hike to today. We will shuttle into town, get our resupply and then shuttle back to Route 2 to hike what we had planned to hike for tomorrow. It is nice to have flexibility in your plans. Today’s miles moved our needle to 86%. Our shortened day moves our next big milestone to tomorrow. It is nearly 7:00 and it is STILL raining quite hard.","Carter Notch Hut

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667508,"“Be grateful for what you have, while you pursue what you want.”It was a cool damp morning in the shelter when we woke up at 5:30. I had hung up my hiking clothes last night and they were quite cold and wet this morning. I tried putting them in the sleeping bag with me for a bit to preheat them, but they were still cold and wet when I put them on. Definitely one of the things I will not miss from trail life. 
We were out of camp by 6:30 and much to our very pleasant surprise, we had very good trail the two miles down to the Route 2 parking lot. When we arrived at the road, Plan A was to hopefully catch a shuttle dropping hikers off at the parking lot and have them take us to town. Plan B was to call a shuttle driver to come pick us up and take us to town.  Although we hadn’t originally planned to, we went with Plan C and walked across the road and stuck our thumbs out. 
After just a few cars went by, a nice lady named Amy turned around and came back to pick us up. It was my first time to officially hitchhike!  We were so grateful for her stopping to pick up three old scraggly bearded hikers and take us to town to resupply. She had driven down from Maine to do a little hiking herself. She dropped us at the door of WalMart in Gorham and we got our food for the next three days as well as some town food we ate before returning to the trail. 
When we returned by shuttle around 9:30, we immediately hit the 1,900 mile mark!  There were rocks arranged on a bridge to form the number, so we stopped and took our traditional pictures and had our fist bumps. There won’t be many more of these milestones to celebrate. 
We had a short road walk and just as we were about to turn up into the woods, a nice trail angel announced that she had trail magic for us. She had a table with donuts and fruit on it and benches to sit on. She gave each of us a nice cold Gatorade also. The weather was beautiful and the day was really starting off great. 
The trail was much better than we have been experiencing lately. There were over 4,300 feet of climbing, so there were definitely steep sections. Multiple times we popped out on huge granite outcroppings with great views. We also had many blueberry patches that we were able to graze as we walked along. We spent a lot of time in deep dark forests with thick green moss covering the boulders and ground except for the well worn trail.  
There were many bogs today with lots of bog boards. Some were submerged making passage tricky. Often if you stuck your pole down it seemed as if there was no bottom to the mud. You definitely didn’t want to fall off or even take a misstep. 
We eventually arrived at Gentian Pond Shelter. It is a double decker shelter with sn absolutely incredible view straight out the front. You can see across the enormous valley to the mountain ranges in the distance. 
About a hundred yards downhill from the shelter is the pond it is named for. It also is a beautiful setting. A large pond surrounded by mountains. I went down to collect my water for the evening and stayed to wash off my legs and dry out the clothes I was wearing. Eventually the sun dipped behind the surrounding mountains and it started to cool off, so I headed back to the shelter. 
After a great dinner of bacon, mayonnaise, tomato, and tortilla wraps, I brushed my teeth and put my bear bag in the bear box by the shelter. The shelter is quite full with lots of new hikers including TC, Whispering Moose, Tech, and Cyclo.  I hope if I get up in the middle of the night that I remember that I’m on the upper deck. 
It was another absolutely great day on the AT highlighted by hitting the 1,900 mile mark. We have an even bigger milestone on tap for tomorrow, and we can’t wait!","Rattle River Shelter

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667531,"“I am a success today because I had a friend who believed in me and I did not have the heart to let him down.”  - Abe LincolnWe had a very early start out of the shelter this morning. We were on trail before 7:00 and started out with a steep 1,400 foot climb up Mt Success. It is true that the path to success is not easy. Just before 10:00 we achieved another success, we made it to the Maine border!  We have now walked from Georgia to Maine and entered our 14th and final state. While our ultimate goal still lies 277.1 miles ahead, reaching the final state in this adventure feels like a huge success in its own right. We took our traditional state line photos and had our celebratory fist bumps. This time it seemed to mean more. We crossed five peaks and two bogs on today’s hike. With all of the ups and downs, we had about 4,400 feet of climbing. The peaks had amazing views all day. Late in the day, those views included large shafts of rain falling. We stopped at one point and put on our raincoats, but it never rained on us while hiking. It saved that honor for when we left the shelter and walked down the hill to collect water for the day. That could have been better timing. I had semi-miraculously kept my shoes and feet dry the whole hike, only to get them soaked running back uphill from the water source in a sudden downpour. I say that it was semi-miraculous that my feet were dry because the bogs were brutal today. There were sunken bog boards, missing bog boards, and lots of walk around trails to avoid the waist deep pools of mud and water. We creatively managed to navigate them all. Other things that we had to navigate today were rebar rungs in the rock both on uphill climbs and downhill descents, wooden ladders fixed to extremely steep rock slabs, and many, many slanted boards with strips of wood across them for traction. We also got to witness a male grouse trying to impress a female grouse right along the trail. After the rains quit, I made another trip downhill and got my water. After a nice bacon tomato wrap supper, it was time for an early bedtime. Today’s miles moved our imaginary needle to 87% of the trail. For the month of July, we hiked 378.8 miles, and those were some hard fought miles. But by far, the biggest milestone of the day was reaching Maine. It was another great day on the AT, and Mt Katahdin is seeming closer and closer. I know I have  a great number of friends following along and supporting us on this journey and I sure don’t want to let you down.","Gentian Pond Shelter

While the “rubble” we were in today can’t even be compared to the rubble she was trapped in and survived, the rest of the quote is quite applicable to today. You see, the Mahoosuc Notch is widely regarded as either the hardest mile on the AT or the most fun mile on the AT. They are the same boulders, same caves, same scrambles, and same leaps for every hiker. It’s how they respond to it that determines for them if it is the hardest mile or the most fun mile. If you’ve followed along on our journey, you can probably guess which it was for us. IT WAS THE MOST FUN MILE ON THE AT!  While it took us about an hour and a half to go the .9 miles from Mahoosuc Notch West to Mahoosuc Notch East, it was a total blast. We climbed over giant boulders, took our packs off to climb through the tiny openings of cave passages, jumped over steep drops to follow the next white blaze, and scrambled up, over, and around the jumbled maze of bus sized rocks until we made our way to the other end. Our attitude going into it was that we were going to have a blast on this adult jungle gym, and we did. We all agreed with TheOkie that if there was a section of the AT that we would turn around and do again, this one was it. Following the Notch came the Mahoosuc Arm. This was a steep 1,600 foot climb out of the notch in about a mile and a half. While it was a strenuous climb, it was on pretty good trail and we all made it up just fine. It is not a section of the AT that we would turn around and do again, though. After dropping us back down to the beautiful Speck Pond, the trail took us up Old Speck mountain. The views were wonderful and just continually remind us what a vast country this is. From the top we were able to arrange a shuttle ride into the town of Bethel to resupply. Our shuttle driver told us that when they had earlier been to Grafton Notch, our pickup point, there was trail magic. That got us hiking the last 3.8 miles down the mountain at a pace with purpose. We made it down about 30 minutes early and Moose Boy and Crafty Girl were set up right there. They threw hamburger patties on the grill for us and had Gatorade, chips, watermelon, and whoopi pies for us as well. It was amazing after such a physically exhausting day to have that real food. We appreciated it so much and since they were thru hikers from last year, they knew exactly how we felt. Our shuttle driver, Homespun, arrived a bit early but told us to enjoy the trail magic and she would wait for us. She was great to visit with on the ride in to Bethel’s only grocery store. The hotel JFK had arranged sent a shuttle to pick us up from the grocery store and then later shuttled us to a restaurant and back. Yesterday, a friend and former coworker texted me that I needed to try a Maine Root Blueberry Soda. At the restaurant tonight they had them on the menu, so I had one and a lobster roll. When in Maine… Back at the hotel, it was laundry, shower, journal, and room snacks time. The hotel owner is shuttling us back to the trail at 7:00 in the morning. Arriving at Grafton Notch completed another map section. We now start our very last map!  Through Grafton Notch, we have climbed a total of 415,163 feet or the equivalent of a 78.62 mile long staircase, and many days it feels just like that. From the beginning of this journey through the end of July, I have taken 4,669,070 steps when my phone has been recording them, and many days it feels like that, too. Today was another great day on the AT, perfect weather, a great experience in the Mahoosuc Notch, and trail magic. It is quite possibly my favorite day on the AT so far, but the best day of all lies 267.4 miles ahead.","Full Goose Shelter

We were hiking by 7:30 on this beautiful cool morning. Starting with an immediate climb, it didn’t take long to stop and peel off my jacket. We had just at 6,000 feet of climbing today as we went up the Baldpate mountains and Wyman Mountain. We saw Flash a few times today. He is a very fast-hiking young man that is doing a 1,300 mile hike and peak bagging all 115 mountains above 4,000 feet in New England. Several of the peaks are on the AT, so that’s how we keep running in to him. We had tremendous views from the mountain peaks. We climbed up the steep granite sides to the bald granite tops where it felt like we could see mountains forever. As an added treat, there were many blueberry patches full of ripe blueberries on the mountains.  Today was the longest hike we’ve had in a while and our feet and knees were pretty beat when we made it to the shelter about 4.  Pointman met us just before the shelter and showed us where to get water for the evening.  It was a hard day, but we made it. The trail was so much better than what we’ve had lately, both in treadway and grade.

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667652,"“Mountains have a way of dealing with overconfidence.” - Hermann BuhlLast night I woke up hot and sweating in my sleeping bag, so I unzipped it to cool off and spent the next three hours thinking about climbing Mt Katahdin and the end of this journey. This morning we were up early again and headed off for what we had scheduled as a 12.8 mile day. We knew that rain was in the forecast and began weighing our options. We decided to add 4.6 miles to our dry day today and shorten our wet day tomorrow. This brought us to a road crossing where we could get to Rangely a day early and spend two nights in the hotel. The other advantage to this was that we could leave our tent, sleeping bag, food bag, extra clothes, and other items in the room and slackpack on our rainy day. The day wound up being another very physical day with about a mile of climbing again. We had a 2,100 foot climb up Old Blue mountain this morning. They threw everything at us. We had wooden ladders going up the sheer walls, rebar paced in the rock walls, stone staircases, boulders, mud pits, and the occasional dirt path. Later in the day, we climbed Bemis mountain. It was very pretty with all of the thick moss covering everything. Some places we had the nice needle covered paths, while other places were bare granite slabs. Near the granite slabs were also the best blueberry patches I’ve seen, with tons of large ripe blueberries. It was a shame that we couldn’t just sit there and gorge ourselves. When we reached the top, we could see lots of rain falling from the dark skies, over a nearby lake.  It seemed that rain would be our fate as well, but we barely got a mist, thankfully. At the stream before Bemis, we had quite the fun traffic jam as people stopped to get water. In addition to the three of us, Pointman & Carlos, Sour Patch & Burrito, Major, Smiles, & Blues Clues were all there. It was a fun visit as other than shelters, you seldom see your hiking friends. There was a water crossing one mile from the end of our day. JFK & I opted to switch into our water shoes and just wade across the calf deep water. On the other side of the water, in the final mile was a very steep 700 foot climb waiting for us. We keep thinking we’ve seen the last of the hardest stuff and the trail keeps giving us a mile of climbing. I had already eaten every snack I had allocated for today. I was running on fumes and was really hoping for a nice level smooth last mile at the end of the day. It rarely works out that way. When we finally reached the top, we came out to the road and an incredible view of lakes as well as the mountains we had been climbing. We called for a shuttle and waited the 40 minutes for them to arrive at the scenic overlook. The shuttle driver was super friendly and offered to stop by the grocery store and wait for us before dropping us at our motel. That was good and bad. I was starving and the last time I went to the grocery store while starving, I walked out with two sacks of groceries. I did it again, two sacks of groceries. When I got to the car, I honestly couldn’t tell you what all was in the bags. I’ve got two days to eat all of these room snacks. When we got unpacked at the motel, TheOkie and I walked down the road to the ice cream place that had burgers and such. I had a hamburger and a hot dog. We were obviously going to get ice cream afterwards, but while we were eating, the line stretched out to the road and it was 10 minutes before they closed. We’ll have to plan better tomorrow. So we walked back up the hill, still hungry. At the room, I ate my steak salad, chips and salsa, cranberry muffin, some ginger snaps, and drank my Moxie Soda. I have seen the Moxie Sodas on Trailjournals for years, but I think that you can only get them in Maine. It was ok, but as far as regional sodas on the AT go, Dr Enuf Cherry wins hands down.  Today’s miles bumped our imaginary needle up to 89% of the trail. The end is feeling more and more real.

It was lightly raining so I wore my rain pants and jacket. We could have easily taken a zero today to ride out the rain, but that doesn’t get us closer to Mt Katahdin. We started off uphill, but for the most part, the trail treated us pretty good today. After about an hour, the rain quit and we were able to peel off our rain jackets. We were still soaked, but it was sweat and not rain. The wet rocks and newly recharged mud puddles definitely slowed us down even though our overall speed was back up to the 2 mph range. The bog boards were even slicker than usual. On two occasions today, I fully dunked a foot. The first time, I trusted an untrustworthy tree. I was using it to swing around the mud like I’ve done a hundred times. This particular tree was having none of it. When I put my weight on it, it just bent over and into the mud I went. The second time I was walking on a series of bog boards, or as I like to call them, thru hiker sobriety tests. Sometimes they have single boards, sometimes side by side boards, sometimes broken boards, sometimes floating boards, and sometimes sunken boards. This happened to be side by side boards with a space between them that was just wider than my foot. I was walking along when all of a sudden my foot slipped off the board into the muck between the boards. I was very fortunate to not lose my balance and go totally in, but I had a soggy foot. I can’t believe I failed the thru hiker sobriety test. Maybe it was that Moxie Soda I drank last night.  At another set of bog boards, we got stuck in traffic behind a grouse. They definitely aren’t afraid of people and this one thought it was leading a parade down the trail. We passed a couple of beautiful ponds again today. They were lined with tall trees and looked like a painting. We had seen moose scat many times today, so we stopped and looked, in hopes of seeing one in a pond, but no such luck. At the end of the day we reached the trailhead where our shuttle was meeting us. When we popped out of the woods about 2:00, we stepped right in to trail magic. Snags, a thru hiker from last year was cooking up hotdogs, and boy did they hit the spot. After Dave dropped us back at the hotel, I got showered and started drying things out. Later we walked down the hill to a restaurant where I had a half of a bbq chicken for dinner. Then we hit the ice cream shop across the street. We beat the line this time and I had a great hot fudge sundae. We firmed up some plans for the next few days and visited with family.

With the late shuttle pick up today, we were able to sleep in past 7:00. We walked the half mile uphill to the grocery store when they opened at 8 and finished our resupply for the next few days. Then it was a walk back to the hotel where we organized and packed up. While waiting for the shuttle, I knocked out my room snacks and a 28 oz Gatorade and a 20 oz Coke. 
When Dave delivered us to the Route 4 trailhead, we crossed the road and stopped for the first of several times to offload some of that Gatorade. We then had an immediate steep uphill climb that ended up being 2,500 feet by the time we got to Saddleback Mountain. Stop me if you’ve head that before. 
On the way up, we passed several scenic ponds and walked through some beautiful spruce forests. A few times we walked up the exposed granite of the mountain where it was very steep. 
I was reminded of the old early 70’s Batman movie where they were walking up the side of a skyscraper. Only we didn’t have a bat-rope to pull ourselves up with. Instead, we relied on the quarter inch metal tips of our trekking poles to keep a grip on the often wet, smooth rock. While I’m not sure our slabs were ever truly 90°, they were definitely very steep and you had to place a lot of faith in your trekking poles and the soles of your shoes. 
Once up top, we spent a lot of time above tree line. I think that is my favorite place to be on trail, because you can see mountains forever. The views were so great that it made for another day where my soul was singing. It is just amazing to stand on top of the world and see the magnificent creation. 
On top of Saddleback Mountain, we visited with Logjam, the local Ridgerunner. I could look downhill and see yet another ski lift. I really hope that the next ski lift I see, I’m sitting on it and skiing back down the hill instead of climbing up to it on a long day of hiking. 
Somewhere between The Horn and Saddleback Junior, we caught up with Sour Patch and Burrito, who were both feeling ill. When we reached the shelter we are staying at, they stopped for a break. We were able to send them off with some of the Tylenol and unused cold meds we have been carrying since Georgia. 
At the shelter, Butterfly decided to try and build a fire to help fight off the mosquitoes. The wood was quite wet, but she and JFK eventually got a good fire going. I have a tiny air pump to inflate my sleeping pad and had seen where one of its other uses was to blow on a fire. I thought I would give it a try as they were trying to get things going. It was amazing. It looked like sticking a blow torch into the fire. 
This is really the first fire in nearly 2,000 miles that we have built. It felt good on the chilly afternoon and helped dry our sweaty clothes out a bit. We will really appreciate that when we put them back on in the morning. 
We were blessed by another picture perfect day today and priceless views. We had over 4,000 feet of climbing today and are getting closer to the end of the more well known mountains on the trail. We have the Crockers and the Bigelows coming up and then no more mountains above 4,000 feet until we reach Mt Katahdin. 
Todays miles did something special to my imaginary needle. The needle is now blinking and the numbers are now glowing red because today we hit the 90% completion mark!  What a milestone, but we have an even bigger milestone coming up tomorrow that you won’t want to miss.

We had seen that Kristian Morgan was making an attempt to set a speed record for hiking the Appalachian Trail. He started at Mt Katahdin four days ago and was supposed to hit the area we were in last night. This morning, I woke up and tried to find his online tracking, but my phone didn’t have signal. I laid back down and about 5:45 I heard music a few yards away from the shelter even though I had earplugs in. I popped up and saw him coming down the trail right in front of the shelter. I tried to get my camera pulled up to get a picture, but he was gone before I was able to. A lot of similarities to a Bigfoot sighting. When we finally all got up, we went through our morning routine and were on the trail by 7. Within the first quarter mile I had already slipped on steep, slick rock and barely saved a fall on two occasions. We are all very aware of the fact that we are literally one step away from a trip ender, even though we are this close to the finish. Our hike went through some very scenic forests again today. At one point we had to cross a large stream and switched to our water shoes to do it. There were rocks ALMOST close enough together to rock hop it, but it wasn’t worth the risk. We later climbed Spaulding Mountain which was our only major climb today. Overall, today was one of the easier days that we’ve had lately, but even the easier days are still hard on the AT. A little before 2:00, the moment came that we had been waiting for. We crossed the 2,000 mile mark!  Amazing!  We have crossed a lot of milestones on this trip,  but this one hit us all as just a bit more special than the others. It is so hard to believe that we have walked these rugged trails and climbed these never ending mountains for 2,000 miles. I can’t even imagine this adventure without TheOkie and JFK dragging me down the trail with them.  We’ve all had a great time, but we all have our daily aches and pains and are ready to make it across the finish line. Things we did in Georgia and North Carolina seem like a lifetime ago. We have made a few changes to our plans to try and mitigate some upcoming forecasted bad weather. We hiked a half mile down a closed road to a point we could get picked up today. We were taken into Stratton by Jen, an amazing hostel owner. We will slackpack the Bigelows tomorrow since it will be a really big day with lots of exposed mountain summits, and is supposed to be good weather. Then if the weather is salvageable Tuesday, we will hike the Crockers on a shorter hike. If we have to take a zero day Tuesday, we should be able to hike the Crockers on Wednesday. Lots of moving parts, but we want to balance our desire to get to the finish line as soon as possible, with being as safety conscious as we can. Some of our hiker friends that weren’t feeling well yesterday tested positive for Covid today. They had been at a hostel last week that the three of us did not stay at. Currently, Jen has the three of us in a separate room at a hotel she owns. It was to be for the night, but we really like the convenience of it and I think we will just stay here for our other two nights as well. There is a store across the street from us and we went there upon arrival. I immediately ate a half pound of ham, some chips, some ginger snaps, and a coke. About two hours later, we walked across the street to a restaurant where we had a nice dinner. It is great to have access to town food for these three days. Today’s miles moved our imaginary blinking needle to 91% completed. But without a doubt, the biggest milestone today was crossing 2,000 miles. This goal was a bucket list item set 10 years ago, it’s never too late to dream big and set big goals. You might be amazed at what you are able to accomplish!","Poplar Ridge Lean To

Today was another non-traditional day where we slackpacked, southbound, and out of sequence. It was also a day that we had an alarm set for 5:30 because our shuttle was picking us up at 6:30 to drive us an hour and a half around the mountains so we could climb the Bigelows back towards Stratton.  Jo, Kerry, their dog Felix, and Time And A Half were also on the shuttle.  
The 16.6 mile day with over a mile of climbing over the Bigelows was a huge day. We wanted to do it today because of the good weather since we would be exposed above tree line on several summits. The weather cooperated and it was an awesome day. At the end of our 8 1/2 hour hike, we felt a few sprinkles as we were waiting for our shuttle to pick us up. 
Early in the hike, we walked up more enormous granite slabs. The granite was surrounded by the largest all-you-could-eat blueberry buffet imaginable. We slowed down a few times to eat literal handfuls of the delicious treats. The views from these granite outcroppings were also great. 
Even though the sky was sunny, there was a bit of haze in the air that turned the rows of distant mountains into blue silhouettes of various shades, much like the Smokey Mountains. We were also struck by the size and number of huge ponds we could see from up high. 
Around 10:30 we came across Spartacus taking a lunch break. We joined him for a snack break as we enjoyed the sun and the views. The peaks above tree line continue to be my favorite spots on trail. They are hard to reach, but the views are quite the reward for the effort. 
Today had lots of areas with great trail.  We had long sections of soft, needle covered paths, and a lot of the time the grade was such that we climbed much higher than we would have guessed. 
Again, like every day on the AT, there were sections that definitely could have been better. There were the occasional washed out gullies where each step was on a football sized pointy rock. There were mud bogs and bog boards in bad shape. One new twist on the thru-hiker-sobriety-test boards today was having a single nail through each end of a long board. After years of use, this served as an effective pivot point. The first one caught me by surprise as my weight shifted off of the center of the board and the board immediately tilted to one side. Luckily I was not pitched into the mud. I became very focused on keeping my weight in the center of the board after that experience. 
When Jen dropped us back at the Stratton Inn, we went across the street to the grocery store for more snacks. Then we went next door to the restaurant and got three pizzas. TheOkie and I each finished our pizza and then I had a pint of ice cream to top off the evening. They are still calling for thunderstorms and flash flooding tomorrow. That means we will most likely zero here and hopefully knock out the Crockers on Wednesday. That will be our final mountain range with a mountain above 4,000 feet until we climb Mt Katahdin. That will take place in only 180.1 miles.","ME Route 27

Two owls and a hen, four larks and a wren have all built their nests in my beard.” -Edward LearYesterday while hiking the Bigelows, JFK & I met a younger hiker who paid us the compliment, “You guys have sick beards.”  JFK assured me that it was a compliment along the lines of “Wicked Good”. I have been clean-shaven my whole life so I really didn’t know what to expect. I had fears of the scraggly Joe Dirt beard and dreams of the ZZ Top beard. I think this Santa style white thing that popped out is a good compromise. I’m still not used to seeing myself in pictures or feeling the beard blow in the gusty wind on the mountain peaks. I’m not getting too attached to it because I don’t think I get to keep it too long after the trail. This morning, we woke up to the expected heavy rains. The nice people from the Maine Roadhouse hostel picked TheOkie and me up about 6:45 and took us to the hostel to have their delicious breakfast and do our laundry. It was fun to sit at a table with Pointman, Carlos, Butterfly, Lone Wolf, and Time and a Half and visit. The breakfast was amazing with multi-grain blueberry pancakes, hash brown casserole, scrambled eggs, sausage, and watermelon. After breakfast we moved to the very large, comfortable living area while we waited for our laundry to dry. We also saw Jo, Kerry, Garfield, Odie, Cash Money, Uncle Sam, and Acorn there. There was one hiker that headed out to face the floods. He is on a tight timeline and felt that it was worth the risk. Everyone wished him the best as he headed out into the rain.  After laundry was done,they delivered us back to the motel, or as we call it, the penthouse. At lunchtime I had a couple of hotdogs and a foot long turkey club sandwich. Then a nap was in order, which was easy to do on this dreary, rainy day. Afterwards I was able to do some planning and organizing for the final stage of the trip. Later, TheOkie and I walked across the street to the restaurant where I had a chicken sandwich. Once back to the hotel, I indulged in a few bowls of Raisin Bran and Oatmilk, the first cereal I’ve had in months. It was a nice after dinner treat. Downstairs from our bunk room is the common area. Tonight, Sonic, Prince Charming, and his girlfriend cooked and ate their dinner here. It was nice to visit with them a bit.  Just before bedtime, JFK noticed that the rain had found its way into our bunk room. There was a drip about a foot away from my bed and creating a puddle by my stuff. A quick trip downstairs to the kitchen for a pan and a towel contained the problem. Now, if it would just quit raining. Tomorrow we plan to hike the Crockers. I can only imagine what a muddy mess it will be. I don’t think there are any stream crossings that you normally have to ford. I hope that is still the case in the morning.","Stratton, Maine

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667904,"“Every mountain top is within reach if you just keep climbing.” – Barry FinlayWell the six inches of rain yesterday made the decision to zero look pretty good. This morning when they drove us from the motel to the hostel for breakfast, there were places where water pooled on the highway, washed out areas into the shoulders, and had creeks flowing out of their banks. 
A couple of hours later, things were looking better. We made it to the drop off point without any trouble. We had about a half mile gravel road walk up to where we got back on the AT. The trail was in much better shape than I would have guessed. 
The areas of water on the trail weren’t generally very deep and we were able to navigate around the worst of the mud by walking on rocks or roots.   
We had an 1,800 foot climb up to South Crocker mountain. After dropping down several hundred more feet, we began climbing to the top of North Crocker Mountain. The tree covered summit didn’t have any real views on this day that we had been hiking in the clouds. Nonetheless, the 4,213 foot summit was quite significant for us. Since we hiked the Bigelows in the good weather of Monday, North Crocker was the last mountain above 4,000 feet that we will climb on the AT until we climb Mt Katahdin. 
We are optimistic that less mountains above 4,000 feet will translate into flatter, faster trails in the remaining days. Today, we walked through more beautiful spruce forests with the thick green moss covering the boulders. The rust colored needles of the forest floor were accented with the orange dots of the many mushrooms springing up. 
After the first three miles spent climbing to the summit, it was a downhill walk nearly the entire rest of the hike. It felt like one of the less difficult hikes we’ve had and we made pretty quick work of it, in just over 4 hours. 
Jen quickly picked us up and then after showering, she took us back to the hostel to resupply for the next four days when we should reach Monson. Since the restaurant across the street is closed on Wednesday, Jen left us her Suburban so we could go down the road to the restaurant that is open on Wednesday and then drive ourselves to breakfast at the hostel in the morning. Who does that?!?!  We continue to be blown away by the generosity of the nice people in the Appalachian Trail community. Jen and Jen of the Maine Roadhouse are two of the nicest, most accommodating, and most fun people we have met in 2,000 miles. 
We did go to the restaurant down the road and all three of us had excellent meals. Since I had eaten three hotdogs and finished off my bags of chips and cookies after our hike, I was in the mood for something lighter. I had their Cobb salad with Maine lobster. It was great. I don’t think I’ve lost any weight in Stratton!
Back at the motel, we all got a head start on organizing for tomorrow morning. Then it was time for bed. 
Today’s miles pushed that imaginary blinking needle to the glowing ninety-two!  The biggest milestone of the day was finishing off the 4,000 foot mountain ranges. Moving to 171.8 miles from Katahdin is exciting, too. We have a big day planned for tomorrow, so we’ll keep chipping away at it.","Caribou Valley Road

It was hard to say goodbye to Jen and Jen this morning. Maybe it was because they were so friendly, maybe it was because they were so accommodating, or maybe it was because they had just served me the best breakfast I’ve ever had. We get so hungry from hiking that often we’ll say those are the best whatever, that I’ve ever had. But you always wonder was it really THAT great, or was I just THAT hungry. That was not the case with breakfast this morning. They knocked it out of the park and nudged Brunch at Brennan’s in New Orleans down to number two. They prepared amazing Eggs Benedict, great Cheesy Grits, awesome Multigrain Blueberry Pancakes, savory Mushrooms, Asparagus, and fresh Fruit.   All of this for hikers. At a hostel!  I would recommend the Maine Roadhouse to everyone. 
After breakfast, Jen drove us the hour and a half to the East Flagstaff Road, where we had hiked the Bigelows.  At the trailhead, there was a hiker that is currently off the trail and doing trail magic. We were so full that we politely declined any food. At his urging, we took a Gatorade and signed his logbook of hikers that he has given trail magic to. 
We said our goodbyes and the three of us and Butterfly headed off into the woods. Initially the trail went up, but wasn’t too bad. Within a mile, we hit a stretch of mud that lasted pretty much all day. There were a few areas that had actually great pine needle covered trail and there were a couple of boardwalk sections. But by and large, we spent about 15 miles stepping on rocks and roots trying to keep from sinking in mud. The trail on the Crockers, yesterday after the rain, was much better than most of today. 
If you’ve read previous entries, you know what can happen when you walk on wet rocks and roots. Well, it happened a few times today. I had one fall where I took a step and immediately I found myself on my right knee in the mud. The impact was sudden, but the mud was quite soft and I wasn’t injured, merely aggravated. At various times, I managed to slide off of rocks or roots and dip each shoe in the slop. 
We came to a small stream that was a little higher than the rocks, so we couldn’t rock hop it. We switched to our water shoes and crossed. I took that opportunity to wash all of the mud off of my knee and legs. 
Our friend Aileron had texted me and said we should stay at the Harrison’s Pierce Pond Camp if cabins were available and we should have the breakfast.  We hiked up to the main lodge and found Tim, the owner playing piano for Sonic and Prince Charming. Tim did have cabins available and showed us to them. 
They are rustic, but cool. There is a wood stove for heat, that we don’t need this time of year. There is a kerosene lantern for light, although the wick wasn’t long enough to reach the kerosene. I haven’t had a lot of experience with using a lamp like that, but that seems important. I have my headlamp and used that. There are two queen sized beds that you just put your sleeping bag on. For $40 a person, you get the cabin, a shower, and the breakfast that has a really great reputation. 
My hiking shirt is a bit tattered, and even though my wife brought me a new shirt to replace it, I thought I could make it to the finish line with the shirt I started in. None of the holes were in very critical places until today. When I pulled it off this afternoon, a big hole ripped open right on top of the shoulder. I was afraid that would rub under the shoulder strap, so I got out the little needle and thread I’d carried the whole trip and sewed it up. We’ll see if it can last 11 more days, as that’s our current target to climb Mt Katahdin. Only 155.1 miles to go!","East Flagstaff

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667963,"“The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.” -Proverbs‬ ‭27:12We had been told that breakfast was served PROMPTLY at 7:00, so we were up early in our rustic cabin. We had slept with the screen door open and could hear the mountain stream roaring all night. It had rained during the night and we could still hear water falling from the trees onto the cabin roof. We got dressed and packed up, then walked uphill to the main lodge well before the 7:00 breakfast time. There were eight of us in the large dining room, seated at tables with small glass pitchers of syrup. At precisely 7:00, Tim, the owner and cook, started bringing out platters of pancakes. The platter wasn’t for the table, he brought a platter for each person. There were 13 good sized pancakes that contained blueberries , strawberries , and apple and were sprinkled with powdered sugar. Then Tim brought each of us a dish of scrambled eggs and sausage links, followed by a glass of orange juice. I made a happy plate, but even by thru hiker standards, that was a lot of food. After breakfast, we had about a four mile walk to another of the iconic AT experiences, the ferry across the Kennebec River. Just before we reached the Kennebec, there was a warning sign that said the water may rise two to four feet without warning. In the past, hikers would ford the river, but when water was unexpectedly released upstream from the hydroelectric plant, they were in danger and sadly some drowned. So now, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy provides a canoe to ferry hikers across the river every day from 9 to 2 during hiker season. Some hikers still unwisely attempt to ford the river if they arrive after hours, but there is a white blaze painted on the floor of the canoe, making IT the official trail. When we arrived at the river, there were 15 NOBO’s in line ahead of us. A round trip to take 2 NOBO’s across and bring 2 SOBO’s back took about 10 minutes. As an extra treat, Greg the ferryman had his dog Maggie with him in the canoe. When SOBO’s came across, Dying Swan was one of them. He recognized JFK from sharing a tight shelter back when he was a NOBO. Since JFK has years of experience canoeing in the boundary waters, I sat in the middle and let him and Greg paddle Maggie and me over to the north shore. After we all reached the north side, we were off hiking again. The trail was another total mud fest again today. We also had a couple of creek crossings with rocks spread just about the maximum distance that I could hop. Once we slogged our way down the side trail to the shelter, we stopped to have a snack and decide if we wanted to push on. Even though it was early afternoon, we decided to stay put. We knew we had shelter space here and with 15 people ahead of us, we didn’t feel good about shelter space if we hiked the additional 9 miles. With the ground that we’ve been hiking being total mud, we weren’t excited about tenting. We spread out our bedding, gathered water, and stood in a ray of sunshine to dry out our clothes. Butterfly joined us for dinner and I had my daily bacon, tomato wraps. Lemon and Detour, two southbounders came in later and joined us in the shelter. Now it is time for bed.

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667996,"“If you want something you've never had, you've got to do something you've never done.”The trip to the privy this morning didn’t set a very good tone for the day. JFK had returned and recommended that we use our trekking poles if we headed that way. He was right. That was the muddiest, soupiest section of trail that we had all day. Generally today’s trail was much better than yesterday’s. We seemed to have more places with the nice pine needle treadway. Those were definitely less muddy than the leaf covered areas. We had several areas with rock slabs today.  Those areas and many others were surrounded by tons of blueberries. We’ve seen blueberries since about Pennsylvania, but never like today. We grazed our way through our hike. The blueberry bushes had clusters of large ripe blueberries everywhere we looked. They would basically fall into your hands as soon as your fingers touched them. We were curious why there aren’t any animals in the area to eat the blueberries, but we were more than happy to fill in for them. Today we started by climbing Pleasant Pond Mountain and ended by climbing Moxie Bald Mountain. In the middle, was Moxie Pond Road and in normal times, a ford of the Baker Stream. Of course these aren’t normal times and with the flooding rains, a road walk was posted where the trail would enter the water. We took the road walk instead of the swift, swollen stream. This made our hike longer than the official route, but allowed us to cross on a bridge. Then we turned and walked up a logging road until we came to power lines that intersected the trail. The area under the power lines was a bog. We had to be really careful with our steps. We had earlier met a southbounder that had stepped in the bog and sank to his thigh. We all made it through the bog with mostly dry feet. As an added bonus, the bog was full with an amazing amount of blueberries. We had to stop and graze there as well. Later we came across Butterfly sitting by a stream having lunch. We stopped and joined her for a snack.  When we finally reached the Bald Mountain Pond Lean To, we were the only ones in the shelter. We changed into our dry clothes and hung our hiking clothes in the tiny area of sunshine, hoping they would dry. Butterfly came in later and set up her tent by the pond. Later, Rope, a southbounder finishing up his hike from last year, came in and set up his hammock. He also built a fire to cook his dinner. Hopefully the smoke from his fire, right outside the shelter will keep the mosquitoes at bay. Tomorrow we hike to Shaw’s Hostel in Monson. That will be our last stop before we enter the 100 mile wilderness. I’m not really sure where all we will have cell signal from here on out. I’ll keep writing my journals and post them when I am able to. As I was eating my bacon, tomato wraps tonight, I put together an outline for the rest of the trail. Obviously things could change, but for now it looks like we will try and cover the 100 mile wilderness, the 100 miles between Monson and Abol Bridge in five days of hiking. That would set us up to summit Mt Katahdin on Monday, August 21st, weather permitting. The end of the journey keeps seeming more and more real.

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668006,"“What doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger.”At 5:45 this morning, a fellow hiker stopped by the shelter to let us know they were heading out early. We didn’t get out until 7:00, so we didn’t think we would see them until we were all at the hostel in Monson this evening. I had my peanut butter Cliff bar and peanut butter crackers as I do every morning on trail, filtered my water, and packed up my backpack. I started off in rain pants and rain jacket today since it rained last night  and a bit into this morning. We didn’t have a lot of climbing today, but we did have enough to want to stop and take off the rain jacket. Two miles in, we came to Bald Mountain Stream and the first ford on today’s trail. The water was moving fast, but above the little rapids, you could see the rocks on the bottom. We switched to our water shoes and crossed the knee high water. Afterwards, we commented about how strong the current was against you. There were two more fords of much bigger and swifter rivers that had instructions for a road walk to cross on a bridge and avoid the dangerous crossings. We started up the seven mile logging road which added some extra length to our day in exchange for some safety. Before long, we ran into our friend that had left much earlier than us. They were spreading their tent out to dry it, which seemed normal since it had rained last night. We stopped to visit with them and they told us their harrowing story. They had forded the stream below the rapids and couldn’t see the bottom. The water was deeper there and they slipped on an underwater rock causing them to lose their footing and fall under the surface of the water while wearing their backpack. They had undone their hip belt, but couldn’t get out of their shoulder straps as they were washed downstream under water. When they eventually got free of their pack, it started floating off and they snagged it with their trekking pole. They made their way back to the bank they had already been on. So, with all of their clothes and everything on the outside of their pack soaked, they had to ford the stream again.  They had stopped once they finally reached the far bank and put on their dry camp clothes. We asked to carry their heavy, wet gear, but they wouldn’t let us. We did hike the rest of the day with them and later, they did let us carry some of their wet gear into Monson. They are a small but extremely tough hiker and we are all so glad that they are safe and glad that they would accept the little bit of help that we could offer. After we finished the river bypass road walk and rejoined the trail for the last six miles, we were back to the mud punctuated trail. For extra excitement, we started to hear thunder in the distance. At one point up higher, we had cell signal and could see a large thunderstorm bearing down on us on radar. We picked up the pace and made  it to our road crossing to get picked up and taken to the hostel. Normally, they run shuttles to the trailhead every two hours. We were about an hour early for the next scheduled shuttle, but the storm wasn’t going to wait. We called the hostel and for $10 they sent Gomer Pyle right out to pick us up.  That was money well spent as we beat the rain. After checking in to Shaw’s they gave us a Coke, then a brief tour of all of the buildings, then showed us to the room the three of us had reserved. There is a full sized bed and a set of bunk beds right next door to a bathroom with a shower. We showered and then walked a block over to the main street in search of food. Since the ice cream place closes kind of early, we had ice cream first so we wouldn’t be disappointed like we were in Rangeley. We went to a store and bought a few resupply items and then to the gas station that had been recommended for dinner. I had a pizza that I carried back and ate in the hostel dining room.  We were going to do laundry tomorrow, but honestly our clothes were stinking up the small room so bad that we decided we better do it tonight. Now it is time for bed and to get ready for the legendary breakfast at 7:00.  Today’s miles moved that imaginary blinking needle to the 94% mark!  We plan to take a zero day here at the hostel tomorrow and then knock out the 114.7 miles to Katahdin.","Bald Mountain Pond Lean To

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668034,"“Roads? Where we’re going we don’t need roads.” - Doc BrownI woke up before my 6:30 alarm to get ready for the famous Shaw’s breakfast. I visited a bit with Pointman, Carlos, and Lone Wolf since they are heading out today. We sat at a table with Blue’s Clues, Major, and Husband. They also headed out today after zeroing yesterday. The breakfast of three fried eggs, bacon, fried potatoes, and all you can eat blueberry pancakes was as good and filling as advertised. We decided to walk downtown to the ATC visitor center and talk to Wendy about the upcoming water fords and the process for entering Baxter State Park at the end of the journey. She had a lot to say. We took pictures of the recommended road walks so if we get to the fords and they are too high to cross safely, we will know where to go. The water levels have been trending lower, so if there isn’t substantial new rain, we should be good to ford streams in the next few days. She also helped me reserve a spot in the park for my son, who we are hoping can hike and summit with me. That is an even more complicated process, but having a spot reserved in a bunkhouse was a relatively inexpensive way of improving his chances to join me. We sat outside in the beautiful sunshine and ate lunch at the deli down the street. After lunch, we bought our final resupply items to get us through the most remote 100 mile section of the trail, the 100 mile wilderness. There isn’t much access in this remote part of the trail, but there are a few private logging roads that cut through the wilderness. Shaw’s has access to a road and for a fee will deliver a five gallon bucket, that you can fill with your food, to you at the road at a predetermined day and time. This will allow us to only carry half of the food weight at the start of our hike through the wilderness. We have set a fairly aggressive schedule to cover the 100 miles in the next five days, so lighter packs will definitely help. This afternoon I was outside at the hostel and recognized Hawk standing nearby. He is one of the people that I had watched YouTube videos of his entire thru hike when he did the AT for the sixth time a few years ago. I would typically watch him on the iPad as I walked the inclined treadmill with a weighted backpack on. I had really enjoyed his videos and learned a lot from him. It was nice to be able to tell him that in person. He was very nice and encouraging and we had a good visit about the trail.  Later, JFK, TheOkie, and I walked back to the deli where I had a really good Rueben sandwich. On the way back to the hostel, we had to walk right past the ice cream shop, so TheOkie treated us to ice cream. Now it’s shower and bed time.

I knew I had to be packed up and ready to go after the awesome breakfast at 7:00. Again, the large breakfast did not disappoint. Poet and Hippie Chick run a great hostel. This morning we sat with Garfield, Odie, Cash Money, and Butterfly at the breakfast table. A bit after 8:00, a van load of us were headed to the trailhead just outside Monson to begin hiking the 100 Mile Wilderness. Poet took a picture of us and sent us off with a haiku. Just after we entered the woods, we came to the sign with the dire warning to carry 10 days worth of supplies and not to underestimate the difficulty of the next 100 miles. We felt like we just entered finals week and we weren’t scared. We are ready to push through to the end. A few miles into the day we met a hiker coming towards us. He looked familiar and it turned out to be M B, that we had been around in the McAfee Knob area. He said he was retreating and calling it quits after several falls. He had flipped ahead and made an attempt at Katahdin, but weather and the falls had proven just too much. It was another reminder that we are all a step away from a trip ender even if we are this close to the end. We joke about the trail trying to kill us, and there were a few falls today, but no one was injured. We did an ATC recommended walk around at a dangerous water crossing. The rumor on the trail is that someone was swept away there in the last few days, but I don’t know if that is true or not. We hope that the rains stay away and that the water levels continue to drop towards normal. Maine has been in a three year drought and we ended it by hiking up here in record summer rainfall. A bit over 16 miles into our day, we reached the big highlight, the 2,100 mile mark!  This is the final 100 mile milestone of the trip since we have less than 100 miles to the finish. We took our customary photos at a couple of places that people had arranged sticks in the 2,100 shape. At the last one, Bright Eyes, a SOBO was walking by and offered to take our picture. As she was getting ready to take it, her dog Sadie joined us for the special occasion. We had great views from Barren Ledges, a nice rock outcropping on the side of the mountain. From there we could see the Barren Mountain Fire Tower, which we later hiked to. There was a lot of climbing in today’s hike. We’re beginning to suspect that we were mislead about the flatness of the 100 mile wilderness. After getting cell signal on top of Barren Mountain, we were able to return a few texts and upload a few pictures. Then it was time to push on to camp. The trail was quite muddy on the way to the shelter side trail, but it got substantially worse once we headed down towards the shelter. Near the shelter, we reached the beautiful Cloud Pond. The area around the shelter is covered in nice pine needles and mossy boulders. It is really a pretty setting. We went down to the pond to collect our water. I noticed the sun was shining brightly there, so I went back to the shelter and changed out of my wet hiking clothes. I returned and hung my clothes up to dry on the small line I carry. They didn’t get completely dry, but they will be much better to put back on in the morning than they would have been. We were kind of late getting to our dinner, but I eventually had my bacon and tomato wraps. It was great again, but I’m a bit sad since there were no grocery stores in Monson, so that is my last bacon of the trip. It’s spam to the end of the 100 mile wilderness. When we walk, I often quiz TheOkie and JFK on where each 100 mile mark took place. Tonight at the shelter, I quizzed them on a list of hikers that we have hiked with on the trip going back to day one. It was a great trip down memory lane. We have really encountered a lot of great people as well as a lot of real characters. We’ll have to try and keep adding to the list these last few days on trail. Our miles today kicked the imaginary blinking needle all the way over to the glowing 95% number!  I’m not sure, but I think I even see a bit of steam escaping from the dial!  The bigger milestone for today, though, was hitting that 2,100 mile mark!  We survived day one of Finals Week with high marks. We’re looking forward to tackling day two!!  Only 95.5 more miles and we can step off of this treadmill!  We are confident that we will see it through.","ME Route 25

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668121,"“The way I see it, if you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain.” - Dolly PartonFinals Week day 2 had us on the trail by 7:00. The .4 mile side trail from the shelter was probably the worst trail we faced all day. At the junction with the AT, we had cell signal and stopped to post yesterday’s journal.      Not too much later, we had a special treat as the trail had been rerouted onto new trail. We walked quite a ways on the soft, needle covered path and it was awesome. We could actually walk at a good pace and not have to worry about foot placement with each step. The path took us to the wreckage of a small airplane that crashed into Chairback Fourth Mountain back in the 80’s. A father and son survived the crash, spent the night in the plane, and hiked out the next morning. Pretty amazing when you see the condition of the plane. We actually climbed 4 mountains today. We had great views from the granite tops of a couple of them. Even more exciting was the volume of loaded blueberry bushes up top. We definitely stopped and grazed often. About 11 miles into our day, we came to the West Branch of the Pleasant River. This river crossing as recent as a couple of days ago was high enough to cause people to take an extra ten mile walk-around. Luckily today the water had dropped to where we were able to safely cross it at about mostly shin deep levels. About 2:45 this afternoon, it started raining on us. We quickly stopped and I put on my rain jacket. After about 15 minutes of rain, it quit. With the climbing we were doing, I was sweating inside the jacket, so we stopped and I packed it away. About a mile from our shelter, it started sprinkling a bit again, but we just kept on walking through it. It wasn’t bad this afternoon, but putting those wet clothes back on in the morning won’t be any fun at all. When we arrived at the shelter, no one else was there, so we spread out our beds. Since there was no more bacon to eat, I had my spam and cheezits on tortillas for dinner. Now it is raining pretty steady and we are ready for an early bedtime with a big day coming up tomorrow. We don’t enjoy the rain, but I guess it is a small annoyance for all of the wonderful sights and experiences we’ve had these last five and a half months. Today’s miles inched the pulsating needle over to the glowing 96% mark on the dial. More steam is escaping and the rumble of the dial is getting bigger.  We all cruised through Day 2 of Finals Week, but it is taking a toll on our feet and energy levels. We’ll be back at it in the morning though. Only 78.6 more miles until the treadmill stops and we can get off the Stairmaster.","Cloud Pond Lean To

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668137,"“Gratitude turns what we have into enough.” -Jim SchmidtFinals Week rolled into day 3 early this morning. We all passed the two tests of waking up before 6:00 am and putting on thoroughly wet hiking clothes, even though we didn’t want to. We knew we needed an early start in order to meet our prearranged food drop 15.5 miles away by 3:00 this afternoon. We climbed five mountains today, but the trail finally really flattens out now. Or so we’ve been told. There are only two more places that the trail takes us up to 1,500 feet between here and Mt Katahdin. Our mileage increases the next two days, but without as much climbing, we hope to make better time. This morning started out quite damp. I was never sure if it was lightly raining, rain was blowing off of the trees, or if we were just running into raindrops since we were hiking in a cloud. On top of Whitecap Mountain we were supposed to have our first really good view of Katahdin, but it was pretty much a white out of clouds when we got there. Hiking through the Gulf Hagis area was quite beautiful. It was another one of those enchanted forest feeling locations with the carpet of thick green moss on everything except the rust colored path of spruce needles that we were walking on. Overall the trail today was pretty good. We were able to successfully rock hop over all of our water crossings we had today. Quite a difference from people having to ford or road walk around them just a few days ago. Today we had several long rock staircases that undoubtedly took an enormous amount of work to construct. We had several great blueberry patches to graze on again today, also. We all agreed that the all-you-can-eat wild blueberries will be one of the things we miss most from the trail. We made it to our designated road crossing where we were to pick up our food drop, just before 2:30. Longshot was already there waiting for us. He got out our five gallon bucket that we had packed with food for the next two days. He also got out a trash bag so we could empty our trash instead of hiking with that extra weight. Then he handed each of us a cold can of Coke. At this point, things were looking pretty good. Then he said that he had stopped before he left town and bought us a pizza!  He pulled out the pizza box and opened the lid to reveal a large cheese pizza. I think our eyes became as big as the pizza itself. I like pizza in the real world, too, but after long days of hiking it just hits different. Yesterday before we got to the shelter, I had bonked. Even with all of the calories of snacks I had eaten, I just don’t currently have enough energy reserves and we have been hiking such long hard hours. That pizza and coke was like a pure shot of energy. Since he had been a thru hiker, he totally understood how grateful we were. The pizza was gone in no time and it fueled us the 3.5 miles to our shelter. When we got to the shelter, no one was there, so we went about our evening chores of setting up our sleeping pads and bags, gathering water from the nearby spring, changing into dry clothes, and eating dinner. Now I am sitting on the front of the shelter looking at the waterfall that will soon provide good noise to sleep to. Today’s miles cranked that imaginary flashing needle up to the brightly glowing 97% mark. Unbelievable. Steam is really starting to shoot out of the dial and I think I even see a few sparks. Not sure how much longer it can stay together. Having all passed the tests on day 3 of finals week, we are going to go ahead and get ready for Thru Hiker Graduation.  The ceremony is slated to take place Monday on Mt Katahdin, 59.7 miles away and you are all invited!","Carl Newhall Lean To

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668187,"“There's no such thing as bad weather, only unsuitable clothing.” -Alfred WainwrightDay 4 of Finals Week started super early. We got ready, packed up, and had breakfast by headlamp.   We were on the trail about 6:00. We finally found the mythical stretch of smooth, flat trail for about 10 miles and we flew. In fact we had covered over 15 miles by noon. It’s amazing how much easier the walking is in a nice trail. Eventually the trail reintroduced rocks and mud, but it was still better than what we had been seeing for the last few states. It started drizzling on us about 8:00, but the temperature was in the mid 60’s, so no one put on our rain jackets. We leapfrogged James and Claire, two Irish hikers that we’ve been around since the Kennebec River. Eight miles into our morning, we passed the Antlers campsite. There were lots of people tenting there. We stopped in for a few minutes and had enough cell signal that I could post yesterday’s journal. Twelve miles into our day, we came to a sign pointing out a view of Katahdin. Far out described it as a spectacular view of Katahdin rising to the north. Hiking in the rain left much to be desired with our views today. About 18 miles into the hike, we met one of our favorite hikers, Chance.  This is his next to last segment of his combination hiking and biking the AT. We had another great visit with him. He had seen a moose at a pond that we were headed to, but we never saw the moose. The pond was beautiful though and even had sandy beaches. We had several more great looking moss covered areas today. We were all successful in rock hopping all of water crossings, too. Once we arrived at the shelter, we gathered our water from the small stream about 100 feet away. James and Claire stopped in for a snack and then pushed in for another 5 miles. Soon, the light rain turned into a huge downpour. Two other hikers stopped in the shelter for the night and we moved around to make space for them. We took a short nap while waiting for the rains to stop. It was very loud on the tin roof of the shelter. We eventually got up and had our dinner. We are heading to bed early, because tomorrow’s very difficult day will start very early. Today’s miles pushed the imaginary needle to the 98% mark. The whole dial is pulsating and the steam and sparks are getting out of control. I’m not sure how much longer it can hold together. Finals week concludes tomorrow. We are very ready but have been a bit nostalgic the last few days. We’ve spent a lot of time remembering hikers we’ve been around, hostels we’ve enjoyed, shuttle drivers we’ve encountered, and so many acts of kindness bestowed on us. Only 38.2 miles to Katahdin and we will knock 23.1 of them out tomorrow!","Cooper Brook Falls Lean To

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668245,"“When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.” -Elon MuskToday was the fifth and final day of Finals Week and we faced our biggest test yet. It was a comprehensive final including the mud of Vermont, the rocks of Pennsylvania, the roots of Maine, slippery bog boards, and our longest hike of the entire 100 mile wilderness. As a reward for taking on these challenges, we got to walk in some beautiful moss and fern filled forests, were treated to unbelievable trail magic, and got our first views of Mt Katahdin. We got another very early start out of the shelter since we had so many miles to cover and we needed to arrive at the Abol Bridge store before they closed at 6:00. We had two big climbs today and the first one started just out of camp. Near the top there was a side trail that we took for our first views of Mt Katahdin. You could see the large mountain towering over the smaller mountain range in front of it. Just below us was a large pond with mist rising up into the sky. It was a beautiful setting for our first glimpse. We were able to post journals and then quickly moved on. The second big climb of the day was Rainbow Ledges. From the granite top we had a much closer, spectacular view of Katahdin. The trail fought us for a good part of the day, but we kept a good pace. We kept checking our progress each hour to make sure we would be able to catch the store before it closed. We needed to resupply for our final two days and we would all love a snack or two. About a mile before we reached the road at the end of the 100 mile wilderness, it started raining. The temperature was in the mid 60’s, so we kept right on walking. As we exited the woods and hit Golden Road, there was a vehicle parked there. The driver rolled down the window and it was Longshot. We were surprised to see him again, but we were shocked when he said he had another pizza for us!  We stood in the rain devouring our precious slices of manna and talking to Longshot. He was there to pick up three hikers and shuttle them back to Shaw’s, but they were late getting to the pickup point. We eventually hiked the .2 miles down the Golden Road, across the Abol Bridge, and to the Abol Bridge store. We bought our snacks and resupply items and then waited for a very special arrival. Soon, my wife, daughter, son, daughter in law, and TheOkie’s wife drove up. After the initial hugs, they handed each of us a quarter pound burger to help tide us over until dinner. My son plans to hike with us the next two days and then we plan to visit Acadia National Park and other points of interest before heading home. JFK made arrangements to rent a bunk room from the Abol Bridge store and that is where the three of us and my son will stay tonight. After putting our packs in the cabin, the three of us headed to the campground showers. After showering, we took all of our wet hiking clothes and put them in the dryer. They won’t be any cleaner, or smell any better, but it will be a lot more pleasant than putting cold, soaking wet clothes on again in the morning. Then it was time for supper and we had more great pizza from a local pizza restaurant. Now we are laying on the nastiest mattresses on the worlds creakiest beds getting ready for a short nights sleep. Outside it is raining and there are mosquitoes, so we are thankful for what we have. Tomorrow we try to navigate the Baxter State Park rules to see if we get a spot in the Birches thru hiker campground so we can climb Mt Katahdin on Monday. The number of spots are very limited, so we plan to head to the signup kiosk about 5:30 in the morning to get in line. Today’s miles moved that imaginary flashing needle to the brightly glowing 99% mark on the dial. All of the glass has blown off of the gauge and there is no slowing the steam and sparks as they erupt out of the face of it. Much like us, it just needs to hold it together for two more days!  We all three passed Finals Week with high marks. It threw everything at us, but the last five and a half months prepared us well. Tomorrow we hope to line up, and then we hope to have good weather for thru hiker graduation on Monday. It is surreal to say it, but the summit of Mt Katahdin is only 15.1 miles away. They say that only about 25% of the people that attempt a thru hike are successful. The odds of all three of us starting together and successfully completing a thru hike together were definitely not in our favor. But God willing, in just two more days, we will have done just that.","Wadleigh Stream Lean To
",Abol Bridge,"Aug 19, Sat",23.10
McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668246,"“Never get so busy making a living that you forget to make a life.”
Last night we settled in to our bunks at the Abol Bridge campground. They were the creakiest beds I’ve ever seen. Every shift of weight or slight movement sounded like rusted springs on a buckboard wagon traveling over a washboard road. Multiply that by four people and you can imagine how much sleep any of us got. 
Honestly there wasn’t a lot of time for sleep anyway. We knew several people had been turned away from the Birches campground yesterday since the number of hikers exceeded capacity. We wanted to insure that we were among the 12 people permitted to stay there on our final night, setting us up to summit on Monday. 
We left camp about 5:20 and were the first to arrive at the sign-in kiosk. We knew the ranger wouldn’t arrive until just before 7:00, but we were fine with that in exchange for not prolonging the completion of our thru hike. We sat and visited among ourselves for a while and then Major and Blues Clues showed up. Later, James and Clare from Ireland showed up. 
When the ranger, Donald Duck (no relation) showed up, he quickly got us signed up for the Birches. He then changed my son’s reservation to a campsite at Katahdin Stream Campground, which was much closer than the place we had reserved just to get him in the park. Although the Baxter State Park rules are tricky to understand and navigate, the ranger couldn’t have been any nicer or more helpful.  He answered all of our questions, then let us store our packs and walk back to Abol Bridge to have breakfast, as long as we returned before 9:00. 
About 8:30 we were back at the kiosk and ready to hike through Baxter to the Birches. The trail through the park was great for the most part. In nearly ten miles, we had less than 1,000 feet of elevation gain. The treadway was mostly covered in pine needles with a few roots, rocks, and muddy spots to remind us that we were still on the AT. We traveled along large rivers, crashing falls, and long sections of moss and fern covered forests. All of the water crossings were accomplished with rock hops.  My son, Matthew had no problem keeping up on his first day hiking with us. 
With such short miles today, we reached the Birches about 12:30. We had stopped by the ranger station to pay and register, but he was out until 2:00.  We set up camp in the shelter and then walked back down at 2:00. This ranger presented us each with our Mt Katahdin hiking permit and our NOBO thru hiker summit number. It was much like a graduation ceremony before we walk across the stage when we get to the Mt Katahdin sign at the summit tomorrow. 
Later, my wife, daughter, daughter in law, and TheOkie’s wife came to visit us at the Birches, and they didn’t come empty handed. They brought us each two quarter pound cheeseburgers, cold sodas, and lots of cookies and snacks. They also shared the cookies and snacks as trail magic with the others camping here. 
About 5:30, the ranger came back and gave us a short talk about the logistics of tomorrow and answered any questions we had about summit day. He was even thoughtful enough to give Felix, Jo and Kerry’s dog, his own Mt Katahdin hiking permit and NOBO thru hiker summit number since he has faithfully walked all the way from Georgia with his owners.  
Before dark, we walked Matthew down the road a quarter mile to where he will tent for the night. Hot lips and Caveman are sharing the site with him. 
The ladies said Goodnight and headed off until they meet us as we come down off of Katahdin tomorrow afternoon. The last part of that sentence seems surreal after ten years of planning and dreaming about it as well as almost six months of hard work to achieve it. 
We are all very ready for graduation day tomorrow. We hope we have one last day of good weather for it. We are planning to be on trail about 6:30 in the morning. Some of the others actually plan to night hike it in hopes of catching a sunrise from the top. I wish them good luck and a safe hike. 
We only have 5.3 miles to reach the summit of Mt Katahdin tomorrow, but it is said to be the hardest climb of the journey and then we still have to hike down. We are definitely up for the challenge and can’t wait to be official Thru Hikers by this time tomorrow!","Abol Bridge

McDuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668268,"“The miracle isn't that I finished. The miracle is that I had the courage to start.” - John BinghamFirst and foremost I thank God for his favor on my hike, for keeping me safe and healthy throughout this journey. I thank all of the people that prayed for me and encouraged me throughout this trip, it meant so much. I thank my wife, Angela for being my biggest supporter, biggest encourager, traveling thousands of miles to come out each month, and doing everything possible to help me fulfill my dream. I thank TheOkie and JFK for being the best hiking partners around and making this adventure so much fun. I can’t imagine how much harder this hike would have been without them. Thank you trail builders and maintainers for giving us this corridor to see so much beauty in this great country and a place to challenge ourselves physically and mentally. Thank you to the trail community of shuttle drivers and hostel owners that provide such valuable services to hikers and enhance the thru hike experience. Thank you to all of the trail angels out there. The amount of trail magic I received has created a debt I will never be able to fully repay. The amount of kindness shown to total strangers is one of the most special aspects of the trail. From hiker feeds in Georgia, to a sandwich and encouraging conversation in Virginia, to water caches in New York, to a pizza in Maine, no matter the size of the magic, it always created tremendous gratitude and renewed my faith in humanity. Thank you to all of the hikers I shared the trail, a shelter, or a brief encounter with. From the larger than life characters when we started the trail, to the “kids” we hiked with for hundreds of miles, each of you really enriched my experience. The trail is funny in who it throws into and out of and back into your path. There are definitely a number of thru hiker friends that I wish we could have shared the whole trail with, but it just doesn’t work that way. Just know that when I see the picture of you standing on the Katahdin sign, I’m clapping and cheering for you and might be a little choked up. But now for the actual summit day!  The Birches campsite has two shelters that hold four people each and a wooden tent platform. TheOkie, JFK, and I were the only occupants of one shelter, giving us more space, which was nice.  The other shelter contained Major, Blue’s Clues, James, and Clare. Between 2:00 and 3:00 am I woke up and saw headlamps around the other shelter. They quietly got packed up and climbed Mt Katahdin by headlamp in hopes of an epic sunrise. We slept in until 5:00, planning to start our climb at 6:30. After I packed up my stuff, I walked down to where Matthew was tenting to have my cliff bar and peanut butter cracker breakfast with him and help him pack up the tent. When I got there, Hot Lips and Caveman were already packed up and on their way up the mountain. We ate and then gathered our stuff to carry back over the bridge to the area by the Ranger’s office. There was a small open shed there, where we stored the items we didn’t want to carry in our backpacks as we climbed the mountain.  I left my nylafume bag liner full of gear with my name attached to it on the provided masking tape. After filtering enough water top everything off, we were underway right at 6:30. It was graduation day and we were excited to be hiking our final steps of the Appalachian Trail. The Hunt Trail to Baxter Peak on top of Mt Katahdin is the official Appalachian Trail route, so we took it up. The trail started out graded well and a nice treadway. It was just another morning on the stairmaster, and not a bad one at that. We quickly reached O Joy Brook about two miles up the trail. We stopped to drink our water and refill our bottles since we were told not to count on Thoreau Spring, the only other water source higher up the mountain, not counting the trail which resembled a creek in many places. Less than a mile of climbing later, we had reached the tree line. We were hiking in very gusty winds and a foggy cloud which cut visibility to mere yards. My visibility seemed like half of that as the left half of my glasses stayed mostly obscured as the unrelenting wind blew the misty fog in from that direction. We stopped to put poles away and I put a jacket on. I cinched the hood down over my hat to keep it from flying off of the mountain. As we hit an area where the very strong wind was being funneled even stronger, we met Hot Lips descending. She said that the winds above were blowing 80 mph and knocking her around. She was finishing up her Triple Crown having already hiked the Pacific Crest Trail and the Continental Divide Trail, but felt it was unsafe to proceed, opting to make another summit attempt the next day. We kept moving forward. We came up on Jo, Kerry, and their dog Felix at one of the more difficult sections that had a short piece of iron driven into the mountain for a foot or hand hold. Felix needed a little boost, but put it in four paw drive and scrambled on up the steep rock face. The path was well blazed and we had quite the fun time scrambling up rock to rock. The blasting winds, which were certainly less than 80 mph, but still quite strong where we were, made for a great sense of adventure. We eventually made it through to the gateway, where the mountain flattens out a bit on the tableland section. We quickly made it to where the trail gently turned up towards the final push to the summit. We met Time and a Half, his wife, and Caveman coming from the summit and they assured us we were getting very close. Visibility was still very low and the winds were still whipping around. Eventually, the sign we had dreamed of for ten years was within sight. After 2,198.4 hard earned miles, we could see the finish line merely steps away through the fog. With no small effort, we squeezed all three of us on the sign for a picture that will always mean a lot to me. In my ten years of reading journals, I’ve never heard of three friends starting the trail together, staying together, and summiting together. Nearly six months of constantly being in close quarters under trying circumstances could have ended badly, but instead forged a deeper friendship and created a lifetime of shared memories. We took our solo photos standing atop the iconic sign, having just conquered the final obstacle of the trail. I had a mixture of feelings of accomplishment of reaching such a lofty goal, relief that the constant daily punishment on my feet and body was coming to an end, exhilaration of the crazy climb to the top in extreme weather conditions, thankfulness, and joy. When I got on the sign for a photo with my son, I put my arm around him and thought how lucky I am to have gotten to share so many mountain top experiences with him. That’s the first time I got choked up, which is odd because I’ve gotten choked up reading accounts of other hikers’ summit experiences in the past. We all stepped down a few feet and sat behind some larger rocks that gave us some protection from the fierce wind. We decided to eat a snack and see if the sun could burn through the foggy cloud. Jo, Kerry, and Felix made it to the top and had their photos. A few others had trickled up to the top as well. After an hour at the summit, we decided to head down. The sun finally broke through, but there was a good crowd approaching the sign, so we didn’t attempt to stay and retake our pictures. The lower we got, the more spectacular the views became until we could see the breathtaking panoramic views that went on forever. We eventually made it to Thoreau Spring and the junction of the Abol trail that we had decided to descend on. The upper section of the trail had lots of boulders to scramble down. Matthew took the lead and effortlessly hopped ahead from rock to rock, where he would stop and wait for the three old guys before scouting out the best path lower for the next section of the blue blazed trail. We soon made it down to the tree line and the more defined trail. About a half mile from the bottom we were greeted by the ladies who celebrated our thru hike completion with us and presented us each with an awesome Appalachian Trail finisher medal that my daughter Stephanie had searched out. Since the three of us have a background in endurance sports, these medals will be a highlight of our medal collections. The total hike had taken us seven hours including the hour that we spent at the summit. We drove back to the ranger station and picked up our belongings that we had stored there and then headed to the house we were staying in. I could barely keep my eyes open while riding in the car very tired, relaxed, and relieved. After showering and changing into real world clothes, we headed out to a celebration dinner at a restaurant on a lake that looked up to a peaceful looking Mt Katahdin that looked a lot different than it had earlier that morning. Today’s miles moved the imaginary needle to 100%. I know what happened to it in MY imagination, but if you run into me or want to leave a comment, let me know what happened to it in yours. The imagination is a powerful thing. I hope I’ve given you enough description and detail that you can imagine what the Appalachian Trail experience is like. I know I got that experience from reading Trailjournals through the years. I would also encourage you to have the courage to start something big. You never know what you might be able to accomplish with dedication and hard work. I’m sure I’ll have some post trail statistics and afterthoughts to post in the near future. Thanks again to everyone for joining me on this trip of a lifetime!","The Birches Campsite
