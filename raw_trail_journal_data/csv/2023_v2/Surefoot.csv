Surefoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660080,"I’m planning on getting on the AT on Thursday, February 16, 2023. Hiking the AT has been something I have thought about for a number of years. But it was always a “someday” kind of thing. I had never given it serious consideration. 
During the year of the big COVID outbreak, in June of 2020, I read an article about the infamous Bus 142 out in the wilderness of Alaska that was being lifted out by the Alaska Army National Guard. To be honest, if I was ever aware of the Chris McCandless ordeal of 1992, I had forgotten about it. Upon reading the article about the bus being moved, I was motivated to look up more information about McCandless which lead me to read the book by Jon Krakauer, “Into the Wild”. After reading that book, it rekindled my interest in reading outdoor adventure/survival books. Pretty soon I found myself reading every book I could get my hands on that was written by anyone who had hiked the Appalachian Trail.

I began giving more thought to the possibility of hiking the AT myself. The only problem was, I had never done much backpacking. I had gone a couple of times several decades ago but never more than a couple of miles into the wilderness. I mentioned my interest to one of the PE teachers at the school where I was working as a School Resource Officer. They offered to go with me on an overnight backpacking trip so I could get a feel for it. My first overnight trip was on a section of the Bartram Trail in Georgia going from Warwoman Dell to the Russell Bridge which is the Southern Terminus. I guess I just needed that to convince me that I could do it. A few months later I did another Georgia section of the trail with my son and his wife.

Each time I broached the subject of through hiking the AT with my wife, she was not very open to it. But as time went on, she knew it was something that I really wanted to do. So about this time last year, she said she would support me doing it. Since then, I have been preparing for it and acquiring appropriate gear. I still did not have a vast amount of experience with backpacking. In August 2022, after consulting with a friend who had section hiked the AT, I decided to hike a section of the trail which is close to my home in Franklin NC. I hiked a loop which included the section of the AT from Deep Gap NC to Glassmine Gap. This was about an 18 mile section of the trail although my loop included about six additional miles of trail. A reasonably seasoned hiker could have easily done that loop over two days and one night. But just to get a feel for it and because I wasn’t all that “seasoned”, I did it over parts of four days and spent three nights on the trail. Completing this section gave me the confidence to continue doing additional sections.
To be continued…",,View Entry,"Feb 07, Tue",0
Surefoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660085,"After completing my initial loop the weekend of August 25-28, 2022, and getting home, I decided to get back on the trail as frequently as possible and begin hiking from Springer Mtn, GA, and see how far I could get before Thanksgiving by hiking on the weekends. So on the weekend of September 17-18, 2022, with my wife’s assistance, I parked my pickup at Woody Gap, GA and had her drop me off at Springer Mtn via the forest service road. I had worked out a schedule (with my wife’s approval of course) to hike practically every weekend through the end of November. I had planned it out so that by the end of November, I would have completed the entire Appalachian trail from Springer Mtn, GA to Green’s Corner Rd in Tennessee on the North side of Interstate 40, which is at mile marker 241.5 according to the Farout app. I had also reached the decision that I was going to count these miles toward a thru-hike. I’m sure there are some who will argue that I can’t really be considered a thru-hiker by counting my initial sections. I get it. But for me, my reasoning is that as long as I make it to Katahdin by August 24th, 2023, I will have hiked the entire AT in less than a year. Besides, I’ve read numerous people who have taken much longer than a year and still others who have written about themselves as being thru-hikers who have never even hiked the whole distance. So as long as I can make it to Katahdin by August 24th, I’ll just be happy I made it. HYOH.
So here is what I ended up completing:
September 25, 2022, Wayah Bald to Wayah Crest, 4.2 miles. I chose to do this section southbound because my 82 year old mother wanted to do the section with me and it would be somewhat easier on her to do the section southbound because it would be more downhill than uphill.
October 1-2, 2022, Woody Gap to Hogpen Gap, GA, 17.7 miles.
October 8, 2022, Hogpen Gap to Unicoi Gap, GA, 14.3 miles. I originally planned to do this over two days but I made such good time on this section, I did it all in one day.
October 15-16, 2022, Unicoi Gap to Dick’s Creek Gap, GA, 16.7 miles.
October 22-23, 2022, Dick’s Creek Gap, GA to Deep Gap, NC, 15.8 miles.
October 29-31, 2022, Clingsman’s Dome to Fontana Dam, 33.7 miles. I jumped ahead and did this section because I had a three day weekend available to me (I was still working a full-time job at this point). Also, I did this section southbound because there was so much elevation gain going northbound that I didn’t think I would be able to accomplish it in the three days I had available to me.
November 5, 2022, Wayah Bald to Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC), 17.4 miles. Just like the Saturday in GA the previous month, I had originally planned to do this hike over two days but I made such good time, I did it all in one day. I could have slack packed and made it much easier on myself if I had realized I could do it all in one day. This was a tremendous boost to my confidence.
November 12, 2022, Clingman’s Dome to Newfound Gap, 7.7 miles. This was an anomaly to my schedule. That weekend, my wife and I had planned to go RV camping with our friends Bill and Sandy over in Cades Cove, TN. But Bill had agreed to do this section with me while our wives went shopping in Pigeon Forge.
November 19-20, 2022, NOC to Fontana Dam, 29.6 miles.
November 25-27, 2022, Newfound Gap to Green’s Corner Rd (I-40), 33.1
I still had a small section from Glassmine Gap to Wayah Crest, 12.2 miles, which I hadn’t completed. I completed those over a couple of day hikes with my friend Bill in early December, 2022.
As time allows, I may do an additional journal entry or two and elaborate on some of the sections I just listed before I get back on the trail Thursday, February 16, 2023. On that date, I plan to get back on at Green’s Corner Road and head northbound towards Max Patch and Hot Springs. However, from this point on, I don’t plan to be doing sections. My hope is to keep going all the way to Katahdin.","Springer Mtn Ga

Surefoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660100,"Bears and Bears and Bears, oh my!
During my first three outings on the AT, I encountered bears. Not that this was the first time I've encountered bears in the wild; but it was the first time encountering them when no one else was around. The first time was when I was doing the Standing Indian Loop hike in August. On this particular occasion, I was just walking along enjoying my day when I heard a loud ""Huff"". I looked to my left in the direction of the sound and saw an adult bear climbing backwards down a tree at no small pace. It startled me pretty good and it was a little close for comfort but I instinctively reached for my phone to take a picture. It all happened so fast there was no way I could have captured it's picture. You'll just have to take my word for it. When that bear made it to the ground out of the tree, it gave one more grunt and then I never heard another sound. I would have expected to hear sticks breaking as it ran away but I didn't.
The second time I encountered bears was on my hike from Springer Mtn to Woody Gap. I was almost back to Woody Gap. So close in fact, that I could hear the traffic on the road. I heard a sound up the hill to my left and saw a bear running away from me. I kept walking and just a few steps later I saw yet another bear. This one ran down the hill to my right and stopped. It was afraid of me but it didn't keep on running. It stopped and looked back at me. I wasn't really scared but I certainly wasn't going to try to get closer. At least this time, I was able to get somewhat of a picture.
The third time I encountered a bear was a bit different. It was on the weekend I hiked from Woody Gap to Hogpen Gap. Again this time I was nearly to the end of my weekend's hiking. I had met a nice fellow from the area who was out enjoying an afternoon hike and we were hiking at about the same pace so we just stayed close enough together that we could have a conversation as we hiked. As we approached Tesnatee Gap which is perhaps 30 minutes before you get to Hogpen Gap, we saw some bear hunters. We spoke to them and they told us they had harvested a bear and their partners were just bringing the bear up out of the woods. I walked down to where they were coming up out of the woods carrying the bear. So, as I said, this encounter was a bit different in that the bear was not still alive at the time I saw it. I snapped a picture of the deceased bear but out of respect for others, I don't usually share that picture. It was a large healthy looking bear. I suppose there are people who object to hunters harvesting wildlife. I view it a little differently though. I know there are wildlife management practices which are necessary to maintain a healthy population of a species without it becoming overpopulated. I respect all hunters as long as they make appropriate use of the animals they harvest.
It was kind of surprising to me that in all of the 241 miles of the AT I have completed so far, I have not seen a single deer on or near the trail.",,View Entry,"Feb 09, Thu",0

I have to give a lot of credit to my wife. Not only has she given her consent for me take on this endeavor, she is really supporting me in so many ways. I won't go into it all but I want to mention that up until now, she has been my only shuttle driver. We really enjoyed getting up really early on those, mostly Saturday, mornings and heading to a trailhead. That's because we would find and plan to go to a good breakfast place on the way and enjoy a good breakfast together. Breakfast may actually be our favorite meal of the day. You can't beat a good cup of coffee at a good breakfast restaurant.
When the trailheads were in Georgia, we mostly ate at the Main Street Grill in Hiawassee. I think we ate there at least three different times. It was a great place to have breakfast. The service was good, as was the food. There was one of the times we went by way of Clayton GA and it was more convenient to have breakfast in Dillard than in Hiawassee. So on that particular morning, we enjoyed breakfast at the Valley Cafe in Dillard. Again, you couldn't ask for a better breakfast. Once I got to the point where the trailheads were north of Franklin but south of the Smokies, it became most convenient to have breakfast in Bryson City. Everett Street Diner was the place. Again, I think we ate there about three different times. They have a Mountain Man Breakfast there that truly is a breakfast for a hiker. They open at 7:00 am and there are usually people waiting in line at the door to get in. The owner of the restaurant is usually the one who seats you and he is very friendly and hospitable. When I had to leave my truck at Green's Corner Road in Tennessee near I-40, we went by way of Waynesville NC. That morning, we enjoyed breakfast at Mountain Beach Diner. They had a good hiker breakfast and it is just an excellent restaurant.
Sorry to spend so much time describing places we had breakfast. But getting to spend time together and enjoying breakfast before she set me out on the trail was important. Even now that we are a few months past those days, she still remarks how much she enjoyed those mornings. I did too. In fact, when she sets me out on the trail at Green's Corner next Thursday, we plan to visit Mountain Beach Diner again.
Early in my AT planning, we were out on the west end of our county and were driving by Winding Stairs Gap where the trail crosses Hwy 64. There was a hitchhiker. I figured they were a thru-hiker and was going to stop and pick them up and bring them to Franklin. My wife was very reluctant to pick up a hitchhiker but I persisted. It turned out the person was a female thru-hiker although you couldn't tell she was a female until we got closer. It turns out giving that lady a ride was one of the best things I could have done. This was probably the first thru-hiker my wife had ever met. The lady answered a lot of our questions and I think it put my wife's mind at ease about a lot of things. Although we didn't get her real or trail name, we learned that she had previously hiked the PCT and only that day had covered 34 miles of the AT!
My wife still has a lot of trepidation about me taking to the trail. But over the last year she has learned a lot, as have I; and she is much more enthusiastic about me doing this than when she first consented. I am going to be depending on her a lot while I'm away and she is going to have a lot on her along with her responsibility of teaching a classroom of second graders. If you are a praying person, please pray for her.",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Fri",0

In the final few days before I’ll be getting back on the trail, I can’t deny that I am pretty apprehensive. On the one hand I’m really looking forward to it and on the other hand it’s gonna be hard leaving my wife and the rest of my family and our dogs.
I have put a lot of preparation into this trip. Anyone who has ever planned a long-term through hike would know what I’m talking about. But even with all the preparation, you can still be apprehensive about how prepared you are. I retired from my full-time job at the end of December 2022. Although I was doing lots of preparation for several months prior to then, I wasn’t able to do a lot of things around the house simply because I didn’t have time. So during the months of January and first half of February, I have done a lot of little things around the house trying to get them ready for me not being here. I feel good about those preparations and if I missed something, I’m confident I can fix it when I get back.
I feel good about my equipment for the most part. Perhaps the most important piece of equipment would be my shoes. I have decided I like Salomon’s X Ultra 4 the best. I normally wear a size 12 but when I first started hiking I went ahead and got a size larger and I got the Salomon shoe in GTX (waterproof). That is an excellent shoe but it doesn’t allow for any breathability. The size (13) worked for me. I bought a second pair of Salomons in size 13 but without the GTX. Not quite enough room in the toe box even though they were fine in the GTX version. So I settled on size 14 Salomon X Ultra 4 non-GTX. I got a pair and loved them. Then I ran into the problem of getting additional pairs of them in my size because I wanted to start my hike knowing I had at least four pairs on hand. Throughout last Fall, I kept trying to find additional pairs but no one had them, not even Salomon. So I decided to try the La Sportiva Wildcat in size 13. It didn’t give me enough room in the toe box. I also tried Merrell MOAB 2. I do really like this shoe but after wearing Salomon, I think I like Salomon better. I especially like Salomon’s lacing. Then later in the Fall I noticed that Salomon had the exact shoe in stock again. So I quickly ordered three more pairs. 
I discovered another thing about my feet doing all this hiking. I developed Plantar Fasciitis mostly in my left foot. I’m learning to deal with it and I have found that my flatfootedness contributes to it. So two things I have learned; one is to stretch early and often both before and after exercises. The other is to get a good set of arch supporting insoles. I’m not going to rely on the ones that come with the shoes. I didn’t really intend for this post to be so much about shoes. But when it comes to hiking, if your feet aren’t taken care of, you aren’t going to make it very far.",,View Entry,"Feb 11, Sat",0

In earlier entries, I’ve pretty much answered the five W’s in some manner or other. One of the first questions I get when I tell someone I’m going to hike the AT is “why”. I’ll  come back to that in a bit. Another question I get relates to the ""who"" question. I’m often asked if someone is going with me. My answer always surprises the questioner. It is, “no one, I’m going by myself"". The truth is I would like to have a hiking partner and possibly I will meet someone along the way who hikes at a similar pace to me and we can become partners or connected to a tramily (trail family). But for now, being from the small town of Franklin NC and not really having a broad circle of friends anyway, I just don’t know who I could ask to join me in this adventure. It’s not like just anyone can just up and take five or so months off to go do such a thing and very few would actually have the interest to. So for now, I’m content to get on the trail solo and if a partner comes along, that would be great.
Now to the weightier question of “Why”. Of course this is often discussed and I suppose whole books could be written about it. I guess I had a few things pointing me in the direction of wanting to do this. I’m recently retired and can afford to take the time to do it. I hate to call this a “bucket list” item but I can’t deny that I said more than 30 years ago I would like to someday hike the AT (meaning thru-hike it). I am 61 years of age right now and I’m currently in pretty decent health. So, one answer might be because I want to; and because I can. None of us knows what tomorrow holds so if I want to do it and am able, there’s no time like the present to do it.
Another aspect to it though is that I want to do something that challenges me. I watch very little television but if I do, it usually is something like “Alone” or some other type show where participants have to survive on their own. I know I will never be a participant on “Alone” or anything else and I don’t really have a desire to. But the prospect of doing something very difficult and overcoming it definitely appeals to me. I know already from my previous time on the trail that this is very much a test of fortitude and endurance. Can I do it? We shall see.
Another motivator for me is this. I know this may not mean much to some people but very early in my adult life, I completed a Bachelor’s Degree. After completing it, which by today’s standards isn’t really that big of a deal, I wanted to go on and earn a Master’s Degree. All throughout my adult working life, I enrolled and many times took graduate level courses. But I never followed through with it. At one time, I had completed 12 semester hours towards a 36 hour Master in Public Affairs degree and then life got in the way and I never went back and finished it. At this stage in my life, I could certainly enroll and complete a Master’s Degree but, for what? It would mean very little to me and would just be an exercise in fortitude and endurance. Sound familiar? So if I’m going to put myself through something that requires fortitude and endurance, it is going to be something that I’m committed to.
Finally, as a believer, I believe the Lord often grants us the desires of our heart. It is definitely my heart’s desire to take this on and complete it. A guiding verse in my life is: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct thy paths.” Proverbs 3:5-6 KJV. I can’t really articulate why the Lord has laid it on my heart to want to do this, but I’m committed to seeing it through.",,View Entry,"Feb 12, Sun",0

I have accumulated an assortment of gear over the last couple of years mostly through trial and error. To start with, my pack is an Osprey Atmos AG 65 liter. I had a different pack to start out with but when I saw someone’s Osprey Atmos, I realized it might help keep my back a little dryer the way the mesh creates an air gap between you and your pack. I’m satisfied with it. I’ve heard people say there are lighter packs and I believe it; but for now, I think I’ll stick with what I have.
My tent is a Nemo Hornet 2P. The first tent I had weighed over 4 lbs so I started looking around. I liked the Nemo Hornet better than the Big Agnes. I know there are several others to choose from but this one is working for me. I have heard Nemo gives excellent service although I haven’t had to call on it yet.
I have two sleeping quilts. I have an Enlightened Equipment Revelation Apex 30 degree and a Jacks R Better 0 degree. I’ll start out with the 0 degree quilt and when it warms up a bit, I’ll get my wife to send me the 30 degree and swap them out. I also have a Sea to Summit Reactor Thermolite bag liner.
I have a Nemo Tensor inflatable sleeping pad and a Nemo Fillo Pillow inflatable pillow. I don’t sleep very well under any circumstances so anything to enhance my comfort is going to help me get the rest I need.
I have Black Diamond Trail Pro Shock trekking poles. They have a little bit of shock absorbency in them and a seasoned hiker recommended I get something that absorbs shock. I like them.
For my water I use a Sawyer Squeeze coupled with a CNOC 3 liter water bladder and one liter water bottles.
I have a Garmin Inreach Mini. I know you mostly have decent cell phone coverage on the AT but I have found places where I had no signal. It is nice to be able to send and receive a satellite text messages to and from home. Even though you may have good signal while you are up on the ridge, when you drop down off the ridge for a camp or shelter, the signal may have gone away. It gives my wife and family peace of mind so it is worth it. Just a comment about cell phones. I made the mistake of switching my cell phone carrier from Verizon to AT&T about a year and a half ago. After having hiked some of the southern mountains of the AT and being at shelters with other hikers who had Verizon, I know for certain there were times when Verizon had signal and AT&T didn’t. Right now, it is not economically feasible for me to switch back so I activated a spare verizon phone I had on one of my son’s cell phone plan. It only caused his bill to go up about $5 per month so I’m going to start the trail carrying two phones. I’m not in love with this idea but I’m going to see how it goes.
I have an Anker battery pack. I’m wondering if they named their company Anker as a play on the word anchor because that thing is as heavy as a boat anchor. I’m going to try carrying it for a while and see if it is worth it.
I started out hiking with my Iwatch but over Christmas I was able to get a really good deal on a lightly used Garmin Instinct 2 Solar. I really like this watch. I haven’t had time to master all of its functions and probably never will. But it does a good job tracking me and recording data. A single charge lasts for days and it partially charges with solar.
This is just some of my gear. There is other stuff; but these are the things that I will be using the most that weigh the most.",,View Entry,"Feb 13, Mon",0

Well, it is February 15th and tomorrow is the date I have planned to get back on the trail. I am both excited and a little nervous. I'm confident enough in myself and my preparations but being away from home this long is going to be new for me. I'm sure it would be for most people. I've done a great deal of preparing for this adventure but there is always be a little more I could do. I know I will continue to learn as I go and I therefore, purposely did not prepare a lot of mail drops. I would prefer to get most of my resupply along the way. Of course that doesn't mean I won't be receiving any mail drops. 
Over the course of last Fall with all the hiking I was doing, I achieved a certain level of fitness. I know I have a long way to go but I was a lot further along than when I started. I was concerned about taking time away from hiking that I would lose some of the fitness I had gained. I have tried to continue hiking and getting exercise but in all honesty, it just isn't the same. I have a hiking trail close to my house where I can go out and hike about four miles. I have been doing this trek multiple times per week while wearing a 25 lb ruck vest. By doing this, I believe I have been able to maintain at least some of the fitness I gained last Fall.
My next post will be from the trail. I'm not really sure how often I will be able and feel like posting. I know it won't be every day. I'm thinking maybe every three or four days. I'll talk at you later.",,View Entry,"Feb 15, Wed",0
Surefoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660203,"Well, Thursday, February 16 finally arrived, and I got back on the trail. Since then, I have been pretty busy, and I have not had time to make a log entry. My first day on the trail, I hiked from green corner Road to groundhog Creek shelter. On my way there, I crossed Snowbird Mountain, where there is a FAA transmission tower that has something to do with air traffic control. That was about the only place that I had any view to speak of. My original plan was to go 3 miles beyond groundhog creek shelter, but the forecast was for heavy rain, and I opted to stay at the shelter rather than tent camp for that night. Although it made for a shorter and easier day for me, it made my second day on the trail longer than I would have liked it to be. It turns out that my second day was a 13-mile and very strenuous day. Although it did not rain a lot in the earlier part of the day, by the time I made it to Max patch, and actually before, I was hiking in the snow. In the early afternoon, I completed my second day which was February 17. The temperatures started plummeting.
 As I crossed Max patch, there was no one around at all. In fact, that whole day, I only saw one lone female hiker, headed in the opposite direction. By about 3 PM, the temperature was in the mid-20s. My goal was to make it to Walnut Mountain shelter even though I had seen some reviews indicating that it was not a very good shelter to stay in. Its location was where I needed to be to put me in position to be able to make it to Hot Springs the following evening. The weather was continuing to get colder, and the wind was blowing very strong and it continued to snow. My water bottle froze around 4 PM and I was not able to drink any water after that. By the time I made it to Walnut Mountain shelter at 4:40 PM, there was snow all over the sleeping deck of the shelter, and there were a lot of openings between the logs of the shelter that allowed wind to go through. But at that point, I had no choice but to stay there.
My clothes were partially wet and as soon as I stopped, I started getting cold. I spread my sleeping, set up out as quickly as I could, and crawled into my 0° sleeping quilt by 5 PM. I was able to stay mostly warm throughout the night and did not get up except to go to the bathroom. I stayed inside my sleeping bag for 15 1/2 hours before I got up and got my pack back together and started walking. As long as I was inside my sleeping bag I was fine but as soon as I got out of my sleeping bag the cold started getting to me pretty quickly. By the time I got started moving again my fingers were getting numb and hurting. But after packing for a little while, my fingers started feeling better. I hadn’t had any water since before 4 PM the evening before, and I knew I was at risk of becoming dehydrated. I got back on the trail about 7:50 AM on Saturday, February 18, I’d probably walked for an hour or more before I came to a water source. The water source wasn’t actually even listed on any of the guidebooks or the far out app. But I could hear the water running, so I climbed down off the trail to get to the water that was coming out of the spring. I was able to quickly filter the water and drink about a liter right off the bat, before filling two more liters.
 My initial plan for Friday was to make it all the way into Hot Springs and stay at laughing heart hostel, but after I had been hiking about 2 or 3 miles, I began to realize that I was just too fatigued to make it 13 miles. So I called Jason Turney Shuttle Service and he sent out his associate Michelle to pick me up at Garenflo Gap. I am so glad I made that decision because I was pretty worn out from the day before as well as the night before. I was able to get a good night’s rest at the hostel. On Sunday, February 19, I was able to get the same shuttle driver to take me back to Garenflo Gap and I slack packed the remaining 6.2 miles back to my hostel. I was back at the hostel by 11:30 AM and had a good restful day. I plan to get back on the trail on Monday, February 20 and make it to Spring Mountain shelter, which is about 11 miles. I have enjoyed my two nights at laughing heart hostel and have gotten to meet some really cool hikers.","Green Corner Rd TN

On the morning of February 20, after having a good breakfast, with Bob, Dave, and NoDak; I began my hike up out of Hot Springs heading north. It was a pretty steep hike, but there were lots of views along the way. I hiked about 11.3 miles that day with just under 4000 feet of elevation gain. That night, I sheltered at Spring Mountain shelter with NoDak and Merlin and Merlin‘s dog Wade Wilson. Water wasn’t very hard to get at that shelter and it was a pretty decent night except the next morning a mouse had chewed one of my ropes in two. 
The next morning, February 21, I continued north, and only went 8.6 miles before I reached Little Laurel shelter. I had done about 2500 feet in elevation gain. Sometime during the day, I was passed by a young NOBO by the name of Topo. He was a very swift hiker. I was ready to stop for the day when I reached the shelter. Merlin and Wade Wilson were long gone and NoDak decided to push on for another couple of miles. So I had the shelter that night to myself. The shelter had bear hang cables, so I wasn’t worried about my food and all through the night I did not experience any evidence of mice.
On February 22, I hiked 14 miles to Flint mountain shelter with about 3000 feet in elevation gain. It was a long day; but it was a very rewarding day. There is a section of the trail that is very rocky and exposed ridge line that literally constitutes the state line between Tennessee and North Carolina. It was a difficult patch to hike, but it was very interesting, walking along, knowing that my left foot was in Tennessee, and my right foot was in North Carolina, and the views were simply amazing. After I made it through that section, I came to Jerry cabin shelter, and stopped for a while and had a break and some lunch. Once I got back on the trail and hiked several more miles, I passed the Shelton Civil War graves. When I made it to the shelter, that evening, NoDak was already there. I did not have a lot of daylight to spare before it turned dark. NoDak had gathered some firewood because he had arrived earlier, so we were able to enjoy a campfire. Just a few minutes before dark, another swift, moving Nobo hiker came in and sheltered with us. He had not adopted a trail name yet. His name is Ian. He said some people had suggested his trail name should be ranger, and he was still contemplating accepting that as a trail name. The shelter had hang cables, and there was no evidence of mice.
February 23 was an 11.2 mile day with approximately 3000 feet of elevation gain. NoDak and I had decided we wanted to get off the trail for a night so we agreed to split the cost of a shuttle so once we got to Sam’s Gap, Steve from Unicoi shuttles took us to Uncle Johnny’s hostel in Erwin, Tennessee. There were not a lot of remarkable views on this day of hiking. On the trip to town, we discussed the possibility of doing some slack packing to help us make it to Erwin the following couple of days, but without us trying to slack pack the whole distance from Sam’s Gap to Erwin. We came up with the idea that Steve would drop us back off the following morning at Sam’s Gap and carry our packs over to Spivey Gap and meet us there at 2:30 PM. So we stayed at uncle Johnny’s hostel that night, and Steve picked us up the following morning at 6:30 AM. But that night at the hostel, we got to see Merlin and Wade Wilson, and also Charlie Brown and snoopy. We also ran into Topo that evening. We had made it to the hostel in time to catch their free shuttle into town where I was able to enjoy a Pal’s burger.
On February 24, Steve dropped us back off at Sam’s gap at about 7 AM. We did in fact slack pack to Spivey Gap. This day took us across Big Bald Mountain, which was probably one of the most spectacular views I have seen from the trail so far except for Clingman’s Dome. I ran into another NOBO hiker by the name of Cayenne. He seemed to be about my age, but since he started in Springer Mountain a little over a month ago and is already an experienced hiker, he is doing 20 plus miles per day. After receiving my pack from Steve at Spivey gap I continued another 5 miles to no business knob shelter. I had hiked 18.3 miles that day with approximately 4500 feet of elevation gain. Of course, approximately 13 miles of that was slack packing. That night, I shared the shelter with NoDak, Cayenne, and another NOBO hiker by the name of Arnold. The shelter did not have a privy or hang cables. There was no evidence of mice that night.
On February 25, we hiked 6.2 miles back into uncle Johnny’s hostel. It was about 850 feet of elevation gain. We got on the trail at about 5:50 AM so it was still dark and we had to use headlamps for the first little while. Cayenne did a quick resupply and kept going. NoDak and I took the rest of the day off along with Arnold. We ran into Ian who was just getting ready to head out even though it was raining really hard at the time. He is a hearty soul. We got Steve to run us into town and I had another burger from Pal’s. Merlin was still at the hostel along with Wade Wilson. Merlin had decided to take a couple of zero days not for his benefit but for Wade’s. He takes care of and watches over that dog better than many parents I have seen. I really like Merlin and think he is a very good man. If you are not used to tattoos and body piercings, which I am not, it could be disconcerting when you first meet Merlin, but he is a great guy and is always willing to help another hiker. I think he has hiked over 9000 miles in his lifetime. Wade Wilson is a good dog and they make a good team.
At the time of this writing, it is February 26. I have decided to take a zero day to give my wife a chance to come and visit me one more time. I plan to get back on the trail tomorrow, February 27. I just met another NOBO through hiker by the name of Prepper. He seems like a really nice guy and I’m sure I will be running into him more along the way.","Hot Springs NC

On Monday, February 27, I walked out of Uncle Johnny’s Hostel in Erwin, Tennessee. I had to leave behind my newfound friend NoDak. I had previously worked it out with Steve from Unicoi Shuttle‘s for him to help me slack pack to Indian grave gap. So that allowed me to walk 8 miles without my heavy pack. But before I started my hike, Steve took me to the hospital in Erwin and I was able to have a really good breakfast at the hospital cafeteria at a really good price. After I received my pack from Steve at Indian Grave Gap, I continued on to Cherry Gap Shelter. I hiked a total of 17.3 miles that day and saw 5100 feet of elevation gain. It was getting dark when I arrived at the shelter and it had been raining. There was already a section hiker there by the name of Steppenwolf. I was pleased to not be alone that night although Steppenwolf slept in his Hammock away from the shelter.
The next morning, I hiked to Hughes gap. There was no shelter there, and I pitched my tent along a forest service road adjacent to the asphalt road that runs through Hughes Gap. Steppenwolf had indicated that he was going to stop at the same location, but he never showed up. The hike from Cherry Gap Shelter to Hughes gap was 10.1 miles, and was almost 3200 feet in elevation gain.
On Wednesday, March 1, I hiked from Hughes Gap to Stan Murray Shelter. This day took me across Roan Mountain, Round Bald, and Jane Bald. The weather was pretty overcast that day and visibility was not good on Roan Mountain. It was interesting to visit the site of the old Cloudland Hotel, but I could not see very far because of visibility. By the time I got to Round Bald and Jane Bald, visibility had improved a great deal, and it was very beautiful. On this day, I hiked 12.7 miles and saw almost 2600 feet of elevation gain. And I was able to meet back up with Steppenwolf at Stan Murray shelter.
On Thursday, March 2, I hiked from Stan Murray, shelter to the Refuge Hostel. Shortly after leaving the shelter, I came across the famous overland shelter, which is a big red barn. It used to be used as a shelter for Appalachian Trail hikers, but has been condemned and is slated to be torn down. It is a shame to know that a piece of history is going to be demolished. I crossed some very beautiful country that day, but again, visibility was very poor. I went across Little Hump Mountain and Hump Mountain. They were very large bald mountains. I know they would have had fantastic views, but the weather would not permit me to see very much that day. I arrived at the Refuge Hostel after having hiked 12.8 miles with just over 2500 feet of elevation gain. I ended up staying two nights at the Refuge Hostel because it was so comfortable and affordable. The owners of this hostel, Robert and April, run it out of the basement of their home. Their home is .4 miles off the trail. They are very hiker oriented.
The next day, Robert took me to Walnut Mountain Road and let me slack pack 8.9 miles back to his hostel. There was about 1800 feet of elevation gain in that trek. On this particular day, I saw some pretty waterfalls and crossed the North Carolina State line for the last time on this trip.
On Saturday, March 4, Robert returned me to the same location on Walnut Mountain Road. I hiked 14.4 miles to Black Bear Resort and saw 2600 feet in elevation gain.
On Sunday, March 5 I hiked from Black Bear Resort to Boots Off Hostel in Hampton Tennessee. I know it sounds like I am doing a lot of hostels, which I am; but I am thankful to be able to experience some of these hostels and meet the people around them, as well as all of the hikers. To me, it is all a part of the experience. I have really enjoyed my time at Boots Off Hostel. The hostess this year is a lady by the name of Pringles. She is a through hiker from 2019. She is very friendly and helpful and makes this place a pleasant place to be. And she was also able to fill me in on other hikers I have seen previously such as Topo and Ranger, who are both way ahead of me now. I have also run into Prepper, who I had met at Uncle Johnny’s.","Erwin, Tennessee

On Monday, March 6, I headed out of Boots Off Hostel after having a nice continental breakfast there. As I was preparing to leave that morning, I noticed they had two growlers from the Lazy Hiker Brewery in Franklin, NC. I had nice weather that day and the hike around the north side of the lake was very pretty. I never realized how big that lake was. But for probably the first 10 miles of that hike, I could look to my right and see the lake, even if it was off out in the distance. I think I only saw one hiker all that day. His name was Kenny and he claimed to be a through hiker. He had a 2023 hangtag and showed me that it was number one. I won’t deny I was a bit skeptical, because he did not look like a usual through hiker. First of all, when I first encountered him, he was eating pork and beans out of a full sized can. He did not wear the typical clothes of a through hiker and his pack did not look large enough for a through hiker. Also, he was not using trekking poles.
I stopped for lunch that day at Vandeventer Shelter. I was ahead of Kenny at this point. I went down a very long side trail to get some water. When I got back up to the shelter, Kenny had arrived, and we visited some more.
There was quite a bit of elevation gain that day and I ended up hiking 16.5 miles to Iron Mountain shelter. I had the shelter all to myself that night.
The next day was a nice weather for hiking as well. I hiked just under 8 miles to Double Spring Gap Shelter, where I stopped for lunch. When I first arrived at that shelter, there was a man with his approximately 20 year old daughter there. They were section Hiking from Watauga Lake to Damascus. I spoke briefly with them, and then they headed out. I had some lunch and was in the process of filtering some water when five ladies from Morristown, TN who were out day hiking, came along. They were very nice, and I enjoyed a nice conversation with them. When they found out I was through hiking, they asked me several questions. As we prepare to go our separate ways, they very generously gave me some of their snacks. This came in handy later in the day. It always brightens my day to meet up with nice people like that.
I arrived at Abington Gap Shelter around 4 PM. I needed to go for water, and it was a long way down a side trail to a spring. After having hiked 16 miles, I wasn’t thrilled at having to do that; but it was necessary. The same father and daughter pair were at the shelter also. They did not sleep in the shelter that night, rather, they hammocked in adjacent trees. They had Verizon cell service and had no signal at all compared to my AT&T service in which I had two bars. Usually, I have found it to be the other way around. I let the father use my phone to call his wife. That night, the forecast was for it to get down to 27°. And I do believe it got down to that. So the next morning, which was March 8, it was quite cold, getting up and going. In fact, I didn’t bother eating anything other than a breakfast cereal bar before heading out. Later that morning after it warmed up some, I stopped and took a break and ate some more high calorie food. I was able to make it into Damascus just before noon. My first stop was at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy office where I was able to obtain a hang tag for my backpack since I did not get on the trail at Amicalola State Park.
I ran into Prepper in Damascus, and I also met another through hiker, whom I had not met yet by the name of Lonewolf. Both of these hikers were familiar with Kenny and assured me that he was legitimately attempting a through hike.","Hampton, Tennessee

After arriving in Damascus Wednesday, March 8, I had a nice burger at the Damascus Diner and then checked in at The Place, which is a hostel run by the Methodist Church in Damascus. There was no heat in the building but otherwise it was a nice stay and was very economical for the suggested donation of $10. The next morning, I had a really good breakfast at the Damascus Diner. I had arranged to slack pack with the bike rental company The Blue Blaze. I borrowed a slack pack bag from Lady Di and got my ride up to Grassy Ridge Rd about 15 trail miles out from Damascus. I got on the trail just a few minutes after noon on Thursday, March 9. I had a really nice hike that day. I met Prepper heading out and later that day I met a young woman from Finland (trail name Finn). I made it in to Damascus and Lady Di’s right around 6:00 PM. I didn’t have to wait long and my wife arrived. 
On Friday, my wife and I enjoyed a delicious breakfast at Lady Di’s, spent the day together and ran a supply box ahead to the Longneck Lair Hostel. Saturday, we enjoyed another good breakfast at Lady Di’s and were joined by our sons and their families that morning. We did the Virginia Creeper trail on rented bicycles. That was a blast. That evening, we enjoyed a good meal at the Wicked Chicken in Damascus. We did a couple other things in Damascus before going down to Abingdon VA where we checked in at the Country Inn & Suites and we spent enjoyable evening together.
I had been planning on having my wife drop me back off on Grassy Ridge Rd, Sunday morning but Prepper called me Saturday night and told me what a hard time he had been through that day coming down to Dickey Gap. I looked again at the forecast on ATWeather.org for the relevant shelters and realized the forecast had changed a great deal for the worse since I had last viewed it. So I had to revise my plan. Sunday morning, after enjoying a nice breakfast with my family at the Cracker Barrel in Abingdon with a “d”, I had my wife drop me off at Long Neck Lair which is also an Alpaca farm. I zeroed the rest of the day Sunday with Prepper and another Hiker, Wandering Monk. Later, we were joined by Shades and her seeing eye dog Blaze. Blaze is his trail name. His real name is Thor. He’s an awesome black lab. Shades is trying to become the first blind female hiker to through hike the AT.
At this writing, it is Monday, March 13, which is my wedding anniversary with my truly wonderful wife. The four of us hikers are zeroing today and our plan is to do the same tomorrow with a forecast high of the low 30’s. We are all enjoying each other’s company. Our plan is to get our host Cyndie, to take us to Partnership Shelter Wednesday, March 15, and hike back into Longneck Lair. Thursday, I think we may be going in different directions. I have to get back to Grassy Ridge Rd and hike across Grayson Highlands to Dickey Gap.","Damascus

Surefoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661026,"On Wednesday, March 15, Prepper, Shades, Blaze, Wandering Monk and I were dropped off near Partnership Shelter so we could hike back to the Longneck Lair Hostel. It was in the upper 20’s when we got on the trail and it stayed that way for an hour or so before the temperature got above freezing. We had a nice time hiking together and it was interesting watching Blaze work. Shades showed a lot of fortitude which she is going to have to have to complete this task as a blind person with a guide dog. Shades ended up getting off the trail at the Settlers Museum which was about 10 miles into about a 14 mile hike. 
On Thursday, March 16, Cyndie, the host at the Longneck Lair, dropped me off on Grassy Ridge Road, 15 miles up the trail from Damascus. I crossed up and over White Top Mountain and through most of Grayson Highlands state park. What an amazing and beautiful place. Even without the ponies, it is still an awe-inspiring place to visit. I visited there once last year for the first time but it is difficult to take it all in. I regret not taking many pictures that day but I had this weighing on me: I was doing nearly 19 miles and I wanted to get to my shelter before dark. If you have never been there, it is worth the visit. The terrain there is unlike anything I have ever seen in the eastern United States. I sheltered that night at Wise Shelter. The next morning wasn’t especially cold, but it started out raining. Later in the day, the rain stopped, although it stayed overcast most of the day. I did not realize I would be doing this, but the trail zigzagged in and out of the park for several hours  on Friday, March 17. I had been hiking for several hours that morning when I encountered a second group of wild ponies. Hiking across this park was pretty difficult. The ground is very rocky in most places and it is very hard on your feet and ankles. When I started out that morning, I had hoped to make it to Trimpi Shelter, which was 20 miles. However, coming on the heels of an almost 19 mile day the day before with 5500 feet of elevation gain, I was a little worn out and opted to cut my day short when I reached Dickey Gap. Even so, it was after 5 PM when I arrived at my campsite. It was fortunate that I stopped when I did, because pretty soon after I stopped, it started raining. I was able to get my tent, set up and stay dry though.
The next morning, which was Saturday, March 18, the temperature was around 27°. The rain from the night before had frozen on my tent and I hurriedly packed up my things and got moving around 7:30. It stayed cold most of the day, although my water never completely froze. I was not able to shed any layers of clothing until around 11:15 that morning. It stayed pretty windy that day, and I am confident the temperature never got out of the 30s. My destination that day was the Partnership Shelter, although it was not my intention to stay there that night. I had previously arranged with Cyndie to be picked up at 3:30 but I arrived there at 2:30. So I waited around there for a while before being picked up.
It was my intention to only spend that night at the hostel and get up the next morning heading north. However, the weather Sunday morning, March 19 was extremely cold. In fact, the forecast was once again for the temperature to barely get above freezing, even at lower elevations. So although I wanted to continue moving north, I decided to stay in place one more day.","Damascus

The creek had to be forded. I took my shoes and socks off and rolled my pants up. This was the first time I’ve encountered this situation. The water was quite invigorating (i.e. it was really cold!). I understand there will be other water fording opportunities further north but hopefully by then temperatures will be warmer. That evening while at the hostel, I received a call from Prepper telling me that if I would hurry up and catch up to him, he would slow down to give me time to catch him and we would hike together.
So on Wednesday, March 22, I hiked 20.7 miles from the point on the trail closest to Burke’s Garden Hostel to Hwy 52 in Bland VA.

Our original intention for that day was to go about 8 miles further, but I became very fatigued that afternoon, and we decided to cut the day short and call for a shuttle driver to pick us up and bring us to Four Pines Hostel. The reason we were trying for such high miles was because we wanted to make it to McAfee knob on Thursday rather than Friday. The weather forecast for Thursday was for it to be very nice, but the weather forecast for Friday was for it to be cloudy and raining.
So on Thursday, March 30, instead of going back where we left off the day before, we hiked out of Four Pines Hostel at VA Hwy 624 and went all the way to US Hwy 220 in Daleville.

We didn’t actually get to stay at the shelter that night because there were so many hikers already there, there was not room for us. So we moved just a little ways on past that location and found a nice area to pitch our tents. We were joined by Speedy and Long Walkabout. This was an 18.6 mile hike and we saw an elevation gain of 4450 feet. We also crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway for the first time.
On Monday, April 3, we hiked to Cornelius Creek Shelter, which was a 19.1 mile day and 5300 feet elevation gain.

On this particular day, we met my wife where she picked us up because she was on spring break. We dropped Prepper off at Stanimals Hostel in Glasgow, and then we went on to a hotel in Lexington.
On Wednesday, April 5, we picked Prepper back up at his hostel, and then we were returned to Petites Gap. We hiked that day to James River bridge carrying lighter packs. It is always nice when we get to have a day when we don’t have to carry our full heavy pack. On that day, we hiked 9.9 miles and saw an elevation gain of 1500 feet. As we were walking along the trail, there was a doe deer standing in the trail, and she did not show any signs of being afraid of us. Our sheltering arrangements that day were the same as the day before.

Again, we were carrying lighter packs that day and our sheltering arrangements for the same as the two previous days.
On Friday, April 7, my wife dropped us off for the final time and returned home. She dropped us off at the Punch Bowl Overlook and we hiked to Salt Log Gap. This was an especially hard day for me because I knew I would not be seeing my wife again for at least three months. It was also hard for another reason because it was the coldest day we had seen in a while and we ended up walking through freezing rain, sleet, and snow. Fortunately for us, we had made arrangements to be picked up by a shuttle and taken it back to the hostel in Glasgow. This had been a 19.4 mile day and we saw a 5200 foot elevation gain.
On Saturday, April 8, we were dropped back off at Salt Log Gap and hiked to Harpers Creek shelter. This was a 19.7 mile hike with 4200 feet of elevation gain. Since this was a Saturday, and as we were approaching the shelter and walking by the closest trailhead, there were a lot of cars in the parking lot. This caused us to be concerned that the shelter might be overcrowded. But as it turned out, all of the weekenders were using their tents, and we had the shelter all to ourselves.
On Sunday, April 9, we hiked from Harpers Creek shelter to Dripping Rock parking area off of the Blue Ridge Parkway. This was a 12.8 mile hike and saw an elevation gain of 3600 feet. We were picked up by a shuttle driver from the Stanimals Hostel in Waynesboro.

Surefoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662357,"After taking Wednesday, April 12, as an extra zero day so that I could visit the doctor for a Cortizone shot, we got back on the trail at Rockfish Gap to begin our journey through the Shenandoah National Park. That day, we hiked 21.9 miles to the Blackrock Summit parking lot where we were picked up by a shuttle driver from Stanimals Hostel. We are doing more slack packing now because it is easier on our bodies to not carry as much weight and we are enjoying staying in the hostels and meeting other hikers. We know this won’t always be the case but as long as it lasts, we are going to try to take it advantage of it. Our first day in the park was a very pleasant day and we saw lots of deer. The weather was beautiful.
On Friday, April 14 we were dropped back off by the shuttle at the same Blackrock Summit parking lot from which we had been picked up the day before. We were a bit frustrated with the hostel at that point because they would not agree to take us out before 8 o’clock that morning and in addition they wanted to take another hiker to the airport before dropping us off. We had planned for a 22 mile hike that day and that was going to put us into our planned shelter pretty late that evening. We did not get hiking that morning until about 9:45. We had been staying at the Stanimals Hostel in Waynesboro. It was a nice enough hostel but it had a little too much of a party atmosphere in the evenings and seemed to place a higher priority in perpetuating their party lifestyle in the evenings than in accommodating serious hikers who are interested in getting a good night’s rest and getting back to the trail as quickly as possible. We know we weren’t the only hikers to feel that way, because we have spoken to numerous other hikers. That evening, we hiked into Hightop Hut, a 20.2 mile hike. We had become acquainted with a hiker who goes by the name of Bear Hang. We first met him at Stanimals and we knew we would be meeting up with him at Hightop Hut. We had also been crossing paths with another hiker who goes by the name of Atticus. There were several hikers at that shelter that evening but there was plenty of room. There was only three of us who actually stayed in the shelter and everyone else was in tents/hammocks. It stormed some that night but it was clear by the next morning.
On Saturday, April 15, we enjoyed the 19.5 mile hike to Big Meadows Wayside. We had good weather. With it being a weekend and nice weather, there were a lot of day hikers on the trail. When we got to the wayside, we were able to get a soft drink and some ice cream. Then we were picked up by Alison from Open Arms Hostel in Luray, Virginia. Alison was one of the best hosts we have encountered so far. It seems the most pleasant hostels to stay at are the ones where the owner is involved first hand in running it. She was both the person who ran the hostel and also provided the shuttle service. 
On Sunday, April 16, Alison dropped us back off at Big Meadows Wayside and we hiked 18.3 miles to the Panorama Parking lot at Thornton Gap. That evening, Alison picked us up again and brought us back to her hostel.
On Monday, April 17, we were dropped back off at the same location from which we had been picked up the day before. On this day, we hiked 16.3 miles and were picked up again by Alison. I simply cannot describe for you the beautiful views that we were seeing as we were making our way through Shenandoah National Park, and the photographs I took just can’t do it justice. Our pick up point that evening was at mile point 960.5 of the Appalachian Trail along Skyline Drive. I don’t think I have seen so many deer concentrated in one area in my entire life as I saw in Shenandoah National Park.
On Tuesday, April 18, we were dropped off for the final time by Alison at the same location from which we had been picked up the previous evening. That day we hiked 12 miles to make it to Mountain Home Hostel in Front Royal, Virginia. After meeting the owners and getting situated, we decided to hike an additional 8 miles to the intersection of the trail and Interstate 66 where we had arranged for a shuttle driver to pick us up and bring us back to the hostel. So that day, we hiked a total of 20 miles. Since our last zero day, we had hiked 116 miles. 
As of this writing, it is Wednesday, April 19, and we are taking another zero day. My foot has been continuing to improve, although I am still experiencing some discomfort. The pain is not slowing me down though. 
I apologize for the lengthy journal entry this time. I know I need to try to do journal entries on a daily basis but truthfully, it is difficult to make that happen.","Rockfish Gap

Surefoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662774,"On Thursday, April 20, we were dropped off by shuttle driver Bill at the Tuckers Lane parking area which is at approximately mile point 980.5. We hiked 16.9 miles to a point along the Appalachian trail that is about a mile and a half into the area known as the Virginia roller coaster. That evening we were guests in the home of Jane, a wonderful trail angel. She fed us a delicious meal that evening and sent us on our way the next morning with full bellies from a hardy breakfast.
On Friday, April 21, we crossed the 1000 mile mark of the Appalachian Trail. We ended our hike that day by hiking all the way to the northern end of the Virginia roller coaster. That is at mile point 1010.2. This made for a 12.8 mile day. We were able to get off the trail at that location and hike down into a residential neighborhood and were shuttled by some really nice people named Scott and Marie Wheaton. They shuttled us to Bears Den Hostel, where we spent the night. We had a really good evening that day. There was a brewery called Bear Chase Brewery, which was within walking distance of the hostel, and we were able to go and enjoy a celebratory (for having crossed the 1000 mile mark)  beer and a really good burger. We enjoyed the company of several fellow hikers both at the brewery and also back at the hostel. We made the acquaintance of a number of hikers, but there was one couple that stood out. Their names were Stephen and Rachelle Cox, from New Hampshire. We exchanged contact information with them, and they told us when we get up in New Hampshire to be sure and contact them. They said they would help us out up there.
On Saturday, April 22, Scott Wheaton returned us to the same location from which we had gotten off the trail the previous evening. On that day, we hiked 15.2 miles into Harpers Ferry. We had a good hike that day, although the ground got very rocky about the last four miles into Harpers Ferry. That evening, we were able to briefly join back up with Wondering “Munk”. (That’s the way he spells it.) We had dinner at a restaurant called the Anvil along with fellow hikers Jeff and Maila, and Stumbledor and Bougieboss. We took a zero the next day in Harpers Ferry and spent quite a bit of time at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy office. That evening our new friends Stephen and Rachelle came up and visited us and brought my hiking partner Prepper, some capsicum knee patches to help with his knees.
On Monday, April 24, we hiked out of Harpers Ferry, 18.2 miles to Dahlgren’s backpacker campground. That morning, Prepper had decided to attempt to get an appointment with an orthopedist to get Cortizone shots for his knees. As it turned out, he was only able to get an appointment for Wednesday the 26th back in Harpers Ferry. So he was going to have to secure a shuttle ride back from Waynesboro PA to Harpers Ferry. Dahlgren’s was a really nice campground along the Appalachian Trail. It  is pretty much there exclusively for backpackers. There were places to pitch tents and hang hammocks. The place had a bath house with toilets, lavatories, and showers. Of course, there was hot water. There was also electricity inside the bathhouse to be able to charge electronics if needed. I think we encountered perhaps the most backpackers we had ever encountered, at this location. The previous weekend, the weekend we were in Harpers Ferry, there had been a flip flop festival. This festival was sort of a kick off for people, intending to flip-flop the Appalachian trail. For people who do not know, flipfloppers are people who start somewhere besides one of the terminuses and hike to a terminus, and then return to the same point, and go the opposite direction to the other terminus. Many people use Harpers Ferry as their flipflop starting point. So needless to say, heading north out of Harpers Ferry on Monday was slightly congested compared to the concentration of hikers we had been experiencing. But that is not to say that the trail was particularly congested. That evening, at Dahlgren‘s, we became acquainted with quite a number of other backpackers. Dahlgren’s was close enough to a highway that many of us went in together and placed an order with Domino’s Pizza for delivery to the campground. That evening, while we were at Dahlgren’s, Prepper received a call from Stephen who was just calling to check on him. When Stephen found out about Prepper’s appointment, he insisted on coming to Waynesboro on Wednesday and taking him to Harpers Ferry. We were both just blown away by Stephen’s generosity.
On Tuesday, April 25, we hiked 18.9 miles to Raven rock shelter. It was actually a pretty good hiking day, although it was hard on Prepper because he was in so much pain. That evening at the shelter, we were again among somewhat of a bubble of hikers, mostly flipfloppers.
On Wednesday, April 26, we hiked 7.5 miles to PA route 16 near Waynesboro Pennsylvania. We had gotten an early start that morning, and we actually got on the trail at around 6:15 AM. So we made it to the end point by around 10 AM. At that point, we were picked up by the father of a friend of mine from Franklin. My friend's name is Joel and his fathers name is Charlie. Charlie transported us to the Cobblestone Inn in Waynesboro. A little while later, we were joined by Stephen and Rachelle. We went out to lunch together and then they took us back to Harpers Ferry for Prepper‘s doctor visit. We waited around in Harpers Ferry for Prepper’s doctor visit, and then they returned us back to Waynesboro. 
At the time of this writing, it is Thursday, April 27, and we are taking another zero day in Waynesboro so that Prepper‘s knees can recover after the Cortizone shots.","Front Royal

Surefoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662901,"After taking a zero on April 27th, we ended up taking another zero on Friday the 28th as well. The reason for taking the second zero was twofold; Prepper needed some additional time off his knee and infected foot, and the forecast was for temperatures to be in the 50’s with heavy rain and wind gusts up to 35 mph. This extra downtime allowed us to spend some time with Stumbledore and Bougieboss, a couple of NOBO through hikers who were also staying at the Cobblestone Inn. We also met Lucky Penny and her daughter Prickleberry who are flipfloppers starting in Harpers Ferry. They are from Mills River NC. There were several other hikers around and it was fun visiting with them as well. I don’t remember all the other hikers’ names but I do remember one. His name was Ramen and he must have been from India. He had that kind of accent. I suspect we will run into him and some of the others again. We are encountering more hikers now that we are north of Harpers Ferry. 
 
On Saturday, April 29, Charlie took us back to where the trail crosses PA Route 16 and set us out. We got on the trail about 6:35 that morning and by 1:00, we had hiked the 15.3 miles to where the trail crosses US Hwy 30 East of Fayetteville PA. Along the way we met NOBO hikers Oz and Little Engine. We also met a section hiker heading south whose trail name was Terminal Lance. This was one of the easiest sections of the Appalachian Trail I have hiked. Prepper struggled a little because his knee and foot were not healed up enough for him to be on them.
Once we got to US Hwy 30, we walked .5 West to 65 South BBQ. We each had some really good pulled pork and then walked another .3 to a Church/Hostel called Through It All Ministries. This is a very clean, well run hostel in the back of a Pentecostal Church. The Pastor and other staff are very nice. We will be zeroing here again on April 30 to give Prepper additional time to heal. Also, it is forecast to rain 100% with thunderstorms. We will be back on the trail Monday, May 1st.","Waynesboro PA

Surefoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663023,"When we got up Sunday morning April 30th, Prepper’s foot was worse. The doctor at Harpers Ferry had thought it was Bursitis and gave him an antibiotic. But Prepper had posted pictures of his foot on Facebook and several medical people who saw it suggested he might have cellulitis. He looked it up and learned that it can be life threatening if left untreated. One of the church members came in and took one look at his foot and handed me the keys to his car and told me to get him to the emergency room. When we got him to the emergency room, once the doctor saw it she admitted him to the hospital and scheduled surgery to clean out the infection. So I have lost my hiking partner. It will likely be multiple weeks before he can resume hiking.
On Monday, May 1st, I headed back to the trail by myself. Of course I started alone back in February but Prepper and I have hiked the last 460 miles together. It was hard leaving without him. I’m hoping he can jump forward and rejoin me when he recovers but that would cause him to have to come back and make up the section he skipped.
I got on the trail at 7:00 am and made pretty good time. The trail was fairly easy with only a couple of short moderately demanding climbs. I’m seeing a lot more hikers on the trail these days. I crossed the 1,100 mile point today which is the true halfway point. So now, there is less of the trail I have left to do than what I’ve already done. I hiked 19.9 miles and arrived at Ironmasters Mansion Hostel by 3:00 pm.","Fayetteville PA

Surefoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663169,"On Tuesday, May 2, we hiked out of Ironmasters Mansion 15.4 miles to Alec Kennedy Shelter. I say we because I have a new hiking partner. Her name is Blue Bear. We first met at the Through It All Ministries Hostel in Fayetteville. When I first walked back into the hostel after taking Prepper to the hospital, Blue Bear had just walked in off the trail. That evening we were discussing our goals and determined that we both hike about the same pace and we both want to cover about 100 miles per week. Also, her goal is to reach Katahdin around the middle of July, which is the same as my goal. So we discussed hiking together, and agreed that we would give it a try. After we left the Ironmasters Mansion, we stopped on our way at Green Mountain General Store and had an early lunch. We arrived at the shelter with plenty of daylight left, so we were able to get set up in plenty of time before dark. Later, we were joined by another couple, whom we had passed along the way. The man’s name was Magilla Gorilla, and the woman’s name was Hotfoot. They are from upstate New York, and were really nice folks. We had a nice conversation with them before turning in for the night.
The next morning, on Wednesday, May 3, we hiked 20.4 miles to where the trail crosses PA Hwy 850. At this location, we were picked up by a trail angel by the name of Natalie. She brought us back to her home and we enjoyed a really good home cooked meal and were able to get cleaned up and do our laundry at her house.
The following morning, Thursday, May 4, Natalie dropped us back off at the same location where she had picked us up the previous evening. From there we only had to hike 8.6 miles to reach Duncannon Pennsylvania. So at this writing, we are staying at a hostel known as Kind of Outdoorsy. So far, we have only met one other hiker.

This turned out to be a 17.8 mile day. There were a couple of somewhat steep climbs early in the day, and then it seems like most of the rest of the day was ridge walking. There were times when the rock fields were aggravating to walk through but then there were other times when the trail was pretty nice to walk. We met several day hikers going in the opposite direction from us, and towards the end of our day, we were overtaken and passed by a NOBO through hiker by the name of Pinky. We made camp just before Clarks Valley Road also known as Highway 325. There was no shelter here but there was a nice water source and some level tent sites.","Duncannon

There wasn’t really a lot of views to take in during this segment of the trail, but it was a very nice section to hike. The forest scenery was nice and the grade of the trail was easy to hike. There were times when there were a lot of rocks on the trail, but there were also a lot of times when the trail was pretty easy to walk. I have to say, this last week of hiking in Pennsylvania has been some of the nicest hiking I have experienced on the Appalachian Trail. I know the rocks are coming. Pennsylvania is known by some hikers as Rocksylvania. I think we will probably encounter the rocks about halfway through our hike tomorrow. I am looking forward to tomorrow, not because of the rocks, but we will cross the 1200 mile mark. That will mean that from that point forward we will have less than 1000 miles to finish the trail.

Then we hiked about four more miles, and stopped for a lunch break at 501 Shelter. Just a couple of miles after leaving 501 shelter we crossed the 1200 mile mark. I was pretty excited about crossing the 1200 mile mark because this means that now we have less than 1000 miles to reach Katahdin. We met several day hikers throughout the day. We also saw a few northbound through hikers. I was only able to get the name of one young woman. Her trail name is leapfrog. We had been told that the reason Pennsylvania is sometimes called Rockylvania is because of all the rocks in the trail that start as you’re heading northbound right after you leave 501 shelter. And we did encounter a lot of rocks this afternoon. The trail itself wasn’t especially steep in most places, but stepping over all those rocks really slows down your progress. We arrived at the place where we planned to tent camp near PA Route 183 at about 4:45 PM. We had hiked 20.9 miles.

We hiked 14.8 miles to milepoint 1220.1 in Port Clinton and then walked up to the St John’s Church Pavilion. We made it to Port Clinton by 12:30 PM. On our way, we made a .3 mile detour down to Eagles Nest Shelter for water and a break. So that added a total of .6 to our mileage for the day. Overall, it was a nice hike. Pennsylvania is a beautiful state. We did encounter several rock fields but we were able to get through them without being slowed down too much. 
Somewhere along the way I lost the whole tip off of one of my Black Diamond trekking poles. I don’t like to waste money but I need good trekking poles. So when we shuttled to Walmart for resupply, I also went by Cabelas and bought a new set. My old poles were aluminum but this new set is carbon fiber. I think aluminum may not be the best material for trekking poles. The aluminum tends to corrode just a little making it difficult to collapse them. I had gotten to where one of my poles would not collapse. I hope the new poles hold up. I had wanted to get a set of Leki poles but Cabelas does not carry Leki. So I settled for a pair of Ascent poles.","PA Route 183

There were a few views along the way which we enjoyed. We took a midmorning snack break at Windsor Furnace Shelter. There, we encountered a group of possibly high school students with about three adult leaders. Later, we took our lunch break at a spring along the way. Perhaps the most notable thing that happened today was when we were about 1.5 miles south of Eckville Shelter. I was in front, and I heard the distinctive buzzing of a rattlesnake to my left. It wasn’t completely coiled up, ready to strike. It was mostly laid out straight. But Blue Bear was behind me and we were reluctant for her to move on forward and cross the path of the snake.

We certainly found the rocks for which Pennsylvania is known. There have been rocks in the trail all along the way, but sections of the trail today were very long and tiring to cross. I saw some beautiful views today and even though the rocks made it difficult to hike, I still enjoyed my hike. Some of the rocks I crossed today were big enough that I could just step from large rock to large rock and it saved me a lot of time, but even then, it can cause you to expend a lot of energy. When I reached the summit of Bake Oven Knob Mountain, I had to do quite a bit of rock scrambling to get down off the mountain. When I reached the shelter, I found it to be in pretty dilapidated condition. On top of that, I found that it was inhabited by two black snakes. But there wasn’t a lot of space around the shelter to set up a tent, so I just decided to sleep in the shelter. Hopefully, they won’t try to crawl in my sleeping quilt with me.

When we first heard it, Blue Bear asked if it was me making the noise. I told her no and that we needed to turn on a headlamp. I was having trouble finding my headlamp, and she got hers on first. We were able to see clearly that it was a porcupine. I figured when we turn the lights on that he would scamper off, but I was wrong. The shelter broom was on Blue Bears side of the shelter so she grabbed it and started hitting the floor with it. This caused the porcupine to withdraw. But after a minute or so, he came back. In fact, he came back about three more times. But eventually he got the message that he wasn’t welcome and didn’t come back.

The price is very reasonable and it is clean and comfortable. We had access to a nice shower and towels. There wasn’t an extra charge to do our laundry and the hostel manager, Tracy, was very nice. Overall I’ve had a positive experience with this hostel. It is right in the middle of town. I’ve done more town walking today than I have since I have been on the trail. I went to the barber and got a haircut. I went to an ice cream shop for ice cream. I went to family dollar to resupply.

Surefoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664133,We left Wildcat Shelter this morning about 6:10. We weren’t able to make a fast pace this morning because of the rough terrain. We didn’t get any rain until about 12:30. We crossed through Harriman State Park this afternoon and it was beautiful even with the rain. I couldn’t get any pictures though because I couldn’t get my iPhone to open or operate because my hands and fingers were wet. We hiked a total of 19.8 miles today arriving at William Brien Memorial Shelter at almost 5:00. There was a through hiker by the name of Dragon and two female section hikers already at the shelter when we get there.,"Wildcat Shelter

Surefoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664195,"We got on our way this morning at 6:30 AM. That is a little bit later than we normally head out but we were pretty soggy from the day before. And we were also a little crowded in the shelter. So it took a little bit longer to get packed up and going. Pretty soon after we got going, we were faced with a decision. We had to take new detour that the Appalachian Trail Conservancy has established or we could stick to the old way, which required a crossing directly over the Palisades Parkway. The new detour adeed over 1.25 miles to the trip, and since it was only a Sunday morning traffic situation, we decided to do the Palisades Parkway crossing. It wasn’t difficult and quite frankly, I have had more dangerous crossings of other highways since I’ve been hiking the trail. Pretty soon after crossing the Palisades Parkway, we crossed the 1400 mile point of the Appalachian Trail. Each time we pass one of these 100 mile increments of the trail, it is pretty exciting.
At about 10:15 this morning, we were re-joined by Splash, who had to leave us a couple of days ago to attend a family event. He is now back with us and plans to stay with us all the way to Katahdin. We made our way to Bear Mountain and climbed up into the observation tower. From the observation tower, you can see a very limited view of the New York City skyline. After we came down from the tower, we walked down off the mountain, which seemed like a really long walk. But once we got to the bottom, we were at a public park, and there was a lake and a lot of picnickers. After having lunch in the picnic area of the park, we walked through Bear Mountain zoo and crossed the bridge over the Hudson River. We hiked to a convenience store/service station known as the Appalachian market. It had a little deli inside and I was able to get a hot hero sandwich and a pint of ice cream. Yesterday, as we were first heading into Harriman state park we met a young man who we later learned was from San Diego and he told us his name was Dragon. When we made it to William Brien memorial shelter, he was already there, and we were able to visit with him and a couple of young women that were there also. Today, we saw him just before we got into the bear mountain area and we also ran into him again at the Appalachian market. When we were sitting at a picnic table with him at the Appalachian market, we learned that his name is not Dragon as in the mythical creature, but his name is Draggin. As he is draggin along on the trail. But he really doesn’t drag, he is covering a lot of miles. We will probably not cross paths with him again. After we finished at the Appalachian market, we only had about .9 of a mile to get to a pavilion located on the grounds of the Graymoor Monastery. The pavilion isn’t anything fancy, but it did provide a roof over our head, and there was a place to take a shower and charge our electronics. There was no hot water.","William Brien Memorial Shelter

The rocks, roots, and terrain kept progress slow. But after lunch, we were able to pick up the pace somewhat. The day went fairly uneventfully and there really weren’t a lot of great views. I arrived at the shelter first at about 4:15 after hiking 18.8 miles. We are staying at Ralph’s Peak Hikers’ (RPH) Cabin. There were a number of hikers already at the site and some arrived later. As of bedtime, there were at least six tents on the site and four hikers occupying four of the six bunks inside. One hiker was “Junk Food”. He had ordered too much pizza and generously shared with the rest of us. A couple of other hikers were”Pops” and “Dances with Ticks”. Some of these names are great. I didn’t get everyone’s name. I wish I could get them all written down. It was a beautiful day with fantastic weather. What more could you ask?","Graymoor Monastery Pavilion

We hiked about 5 miles to NY Route 52 and walked .5 miles south to a deli where we were able get a breakfast sandwich, a pastry, and a good cup of coffee. After enjoying that treat we hiked the rest of the way to Telephone Pioneers Shelter stopping for a brief lunch break along the way. At one point today, we hiked past a really huge oak tree. I don’t know any story about this tree but I’m sure there is one. We hiked a total of 16.8 miles today not counting the one mile round trip to the deli. We didn’t see many hikers today although we did see Emily from Australia stealth camping near the Telephone Pioneers Shelter. We had first met Emily at the Church of the Mountain Hostel in Delaware Water Gap. There is a young man named Jack at the shelter with us tonight. Today’s hike wasn’t particularly strenuous.

Surefoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664383,"We left out this morning from Telephone Pioneers Shelter at about 6:20 AM. We had good weather almost all day today. It was an especially good morning. I had something surprising happen to me this morning though. As I was walking along, I could see a hiker approaching me from the opposite direction. As she drew closer, she asked me if I do a trail journal. I answered yes, and she asked me “are you Surefoot?” I told her I was, and she said she recognized me from my entries. That was surprising to me because I really wasn’t sure how many people even pay attention to my entries. She introduced herself as Christine and I asked her if she was Christine the shuttle driver. She said she was. So, although we have never met each other before, we were already aware of each other. She is a very nice lady and I enjoyed meeting her.
Later, in the morning, we stopped at Wiley Shelter to have lunch. As we were getting ready to leave, Emily from Australia came in and we spoke briefly to her and a gentleman that was hiking with her before getting going. We had planned to only hike to the next shelter, which was Ten Mile River Shelter. But when we got to the shelter, it was still fairly early and there wasn’t a safe water supply nearby. Also, about a mile and a half further up the trail, there was a country store called Bulls Bridge Country Store. We decided to hike on to that store and get some ice cream and a soft drink. After resting and doing a little recharge to our electronics, we decided to hike on to Schaghticoke Mtn Campsite which is a place for hikers to tent camp. It is convenient because it has ready-made tent sites, a bear box, and a privy. This made for an 18.7 mile day. There was rain in the forecast for this afternoon, which is why we had thought about stopping short at the Ten Mile River Shelter. We had managed to enjoy some really nice weather all day today which caused us to push our luck. But it finally caught up with us about 3 miles out from our campsite. We got rained on. But at least the rain had let up by the time we reached the campsite. Tomorrow, we only have a 3.2 mile hike into Kent, Connecticut where we plan to resupply, get showers, do laundry, and then hike back out about 7 miles.","Telephone Pioneers Shelter

Surefoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664428,"We got on our way from Schaghticoke Mtn Campsite by around 6:15 AM this morning. It was a surprisingly strenuous hike, although it was only about 3.2 miles into Kent. There were some fairly steep ups and downs along the way. I had communicated with shuttle driver, Christine the previous evening about her recommendations for where we could have breakfast. She let me know that she was going to be in Kent around 7:30 this morning and I told her we would probably be getting to Kent around 8 AM. When we were less than .25 from Kent, we were met by Christine. She very generously offered to drive us into town. Once we got to town, she actually drove us around a little bit and showed us where things were. In my journeys on the Appalachian Trail, I have seen some shuttle drivers who do it for the money and I have seen others who are genuinely interested in the hikers and serving them and wanting their success. Christine is definitely in the latter group. 
Once we got into Kent, the first order of business was going to a diner and having a hardy breakfast. Next, we went over to the Kent, welcome center. It is basically just a public restroom but on the backside of the building, there is a coin operated shower. So for two dollars you got a four minute hot shower, which was plenty of time to get cleaned up. Next, we walked a short distance over to the laundromat and did our laundry. At all three places, while we were there, we had our electronics plugged up to recharge. The post office was nearby to the laundromat and we were able to pick up some packages which had been mailed to us. I was able to get three days worth of resupply in my mail drop and I also was able to get my new trekking poles. At one point today, Blue Bear visited the local IGA grocery store for some resupply items and Splash visited a bakery for some pastries. 
I we got going from Kent around 1:15 PM and probably got back to the trail around 1:45 PM. We hiked an additional 7 miles on the Appalachian Trail to Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter. So all total, we hiked 10.2 miles. Along the way today, we saw Emily from Australia again.","Schaghticoke Mtn Campsite

Surefoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664499,"We left from Stewart Hollow Shelter at about 6:10 AM. The first couple of miles were level and very easy. But then the trail got rough and we had a lot of ups and downs with rugged terrain for most of the day. It slowed us down quite a bit and we weren’t able to make our usual miles per hour. We had planned to hike to Limestone Spring Shelter today but we got so worn out and the hike was going to be a 22.7 mile hike if we had done that. So instead we decided to stop at Falls Village. We had heard about someone who allows hikers to camp in his backyard so we stopped at the Falls Village Café and got a burger and then contacted the guy. He was very willing to help us out so we are now camped in our tents in his backyard. So our hike today turned out to be an 18.3 mile hike.
Along the way today, we stopped in at Pine Swamp Shelter for lunch. For a lot of the afternoon, we kept hearing what sounded like a race track with big cars racing. It was so loud and distinct that I decided to look it up on Google as I was walking. I determined that there was indeed a track nearby known as the Lime Rock Drivers Club. It was a really nice race track that was designed for road racing, not oval track racing. When we got a little further up the trail, I was able to see pretty clearly a portion of the track.","Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter

Pretty soon after leaving Falls Village, we crossed the 1500 mile point of the trail. We also passed a really pretty waterfall which I would presume is the reason the town got its name. Along the way we dropped in to Salisbury Connecticut and visited a grocery store's deli and got a hot breakfast sandwich and a couple of other things to eat for a mid-morning breakfast. As we were walking back to the trail, we saw an adolescent bear in a residential neighborhood. The bear was trying to cross the road and get back up into the woods, but there was a lot of traffic and our presence added to his confusion. I felt sorry for the bear because he looked a little scruffy and he was carrying his left front paw and was not putting any weight on it. He was clearly injured. This was the first bear I have seen since I was hiking the trail last fall. We stopped in at Brassie Brook Shelter to have lunch and found a large crew of trail maintainers rebuilding the shelter. They were a friendly bunch of men and were doing an excellent job. We went across Bear Mountain Connecticut, which is the highest point in Connecticut. Shortly after crossing over the mountain we crossed into Massachusetts, leaving Connecticut behind. When we reached the campsite, there were already several hikers around and others showed up as well. It is always interesting meeting other hikers and you can always learn something.

I have been seeing moose skat ever since Vermont, but this was the first time I had come across fresh tracks. I am hopeful that I get to see a moose during this trek. I like staying at this hostel. The cabin we are in is a timber frame structure and is rustic. This hostel is located in a very rural area and there is not much around to be able to go to a restaurant and get something to eat. Also, there is not a proper bathhouse and what serves as the bathhouse is basically just a tent with a shower, a washer and dryer and a toilet. It is pretty basic. It is in pretty sharp contrast to the hostel we stayed at the night before. I have found this to be true all along the trail.

On the way to the trailhead we spotted a bear crossing the road in an area where there were houses. That makes the second time I’ve seen a bear since February 16 and neither time was it out in the woods. 
This was a slow going day. We got going a little after 7:30 AM. We hiked up and over Mt Wolf and down to Eliza Brook Shelter where we had lunch a little after 12:00 PM. This was only about 7 miles which is a lot slower pace than we’re used to. The section between Mt Wolf and the Eliza Brook Shelter is where my friend Speedy broke her leg a couple of weeks earlier and I kept thinking about that. 
After lunch we hiked up and over the Kinsmans. After that, our pace picked up a bit. It had been forecast to rain heavy all day and we were mentally prepared for it but in fact, it never really rained all day. But that doesn’t mean we stayed dry. The weather was dreary and humid all day. On top of that, there were streams of water literally running down the trail. There was simply no way to keep your feet dry. Brushing past wet trees all day caused us to be nearly completely soaked by the end of the day.

They took us to their house and let us stay in their camper. We will be using their place as a base camp for about the next week. They served us a delicious dinner last night and also fixed us a hardy breakfast this morning before taking us back to the trail. We had gotten off the trail Saturday just after it crossed under Interstate 93. But this morning we were able to avoid doing the long blue blaze trail back up to the trail. Instead, Steve dropped us off on the side of Interstate 93 right where it crosses over the trail.

She had been experiencing growing back pain and today she had to make the decision to get off the trail. We spent the previous night in the shelter at Garfield Ridge Campsite. It turned out to be a full house in the shelter. I’m not really interested in repeating that again. It is just too close quarters for my comfort. When we left the shelter this morning we hiked 2.1 miles and reached the intersection with the Gale River Trail. A sign said it was 4.0 miles to Gale River Road. That was the point at which Blue Bear reached her decision to get off. I contacted my friend Steve to see if he could meet us and pick up Blue Bear to which he readily agreed. Splash and I walked her down this trail until we met Steve and passed her off to him. I estimate we walked close to three of the four miles down to the trailhead. Once we knew Blue Bear was in safe hands, Splash and I walked back up the steep trail back to the AT. From that point on the trail, it was only .6 miles to Galehead Hut.

There have been numerous deaths on that mountain because the weather changed and people were unprepared for the conditions that can happen there. So we were very pleased that we had very mild temperatures and low winds when we went across. Overall, the day was a fairly difficult day. When we got to the summit of Mount Washington, we were thinking that would be the completion of the toughest part of the day. But we were surprised to find that the rest of the day was even more difficult. We made very slow progress and only averaged about one mph for the whole day. We got started at 8 AM and only made it to the tent site by around 6:15 PM. Even though it was a difficult day, we were able to enjoy spectacular views.

There was a bit of a tricky river crossing to get from the parking lot to the trail. Once we made it to the trail we went vertical for about a mile. In that one mile we went from 2000 feet elevation to 4000 feet elevation. What a climb! A crew member from the Carter Notch Hut where we stopped later for lunch told us that is the steepest one mile section on the AT. I believe it.

This made for a very long day because we could not make fast progress. We arrived at the shelter at around 7:30 PM. That is late for us.

The thunder and lightning was very close and kept us awake quite a bit. It must have put down a massive amount of rain. The trail was the wettest I’ve ever seen. Literally, the entire time we were on the trail, it was like a small stream running down the trail. There were numerous points along the trail where there was water standing and you either tried to skirt around the water or you just sloshed right through it. Then there were a couple of river crossings. These crossings were quite treacherous because the flow volume was so high. We didn’t have any choice but to find a way across the rivers, but there were times when it was very scary. Ultimately, we gave up on trying to keep our boots from becoming full of water. The only way to get across these rivers was to rock hop. But when I say rock up, I don’t mean stepping on rocks that are above the surface of the water. The flow of the river was so strong, the best you could do was look for rocks that were from 6 to 12 inches below the surface of the water and step there. There were places where the water was much deeper and the current was way too strong to stand against. So we had to look for places where the water was shallow enough to not sweep us away. The river we crossed was called the Rattle River. We had to cross it at least twice while we were still higher up on the mountain and it had not become so strong. But once we got lower down the mountain there was absolutely no way of crossing the river. We found a side river that converged with the Rattle River which we had to cross. This river had a very strong current also; but we were able to manage it. It took us 6 1/2 hours to traverse this 8 miles. Most of it was downhill, but that was not a consolation. 
Steve met us at the trail head and brought us back to his home. Along the way, we stopped at a Chinese buffet in Gorham and had lunch. My left foot pain has been flaring up quite a bit the last couple of days. I am hoping it is just because the hiking has been so difficult these last few days. Steve and Rachelle suggested that I visit their chiropractor to see if he could give me some relief. Steve took me into Littleton and I was able to get in to see the chiropractor. He was very nice and made some adjustments as well as showed me some massages I can do. He also gave me some kinesio tape and showed me how to apply it to my foot. I am hoping this helps because there is only 300 miles left to finish this journey. We are taking a zero day Tuesday, June 27th to try to recover from the White Mountains.

But I have to admit, it was kind of fun. Like a jungle gym for adults. I actually quite enjoyed it even though it took a lot of energy. I took a hard fall going through and banged by chin really hard on a rock. It hurt and I was stuck there for a minute and was a little concerned that I might be injured. But I wasn’t seriously injured and was able to get up and move on. Praise God!  After we made it through the Notch, we had to wade thigh deep icy cold water in order to move forward. That was not so fun. We took a brief break at a campsite and moved on to the Mahoosuc Arm. That, my friends, was no joke. It was a mile and a half precarious climb almost straight up the side of a mountain. There were other climbs and descents throughout the remainder of the day. And I took another hard fall thankfully with no serious injuries. These damp rocks can’t be trusted! By the end of the day, we were all so exhausted. By “we” I mean myself, Splash, and Kidding. I don’t think Kidding is going to become a permanent part of mine and Splash’s team but it is a pleasure walking with her.

We were able to slack-pack this section because the hostel owners at the Maine Roadhouse carried the bulk of our gear for us up the trail to the Terrapin Hostel in Kingfield ME. So when we arrived at Long Falls Dam Rd, Lauran, the owner of the Terrapin Hostel picked us up and shuttled us to his hostel. This was a long day. We were on the trail just before 7:00 AM and we didn’t get to the end of our hiking day until about 6:15 PM. We hiked up and over the Bigelo Mtns. There won’t be any more high mountains for us to climb until we reach Katahdin. There are other mountains but none of them are anywhere near 4,000 feet. Our day included 5800 ft of ascent and 5900 ft of descent. Needless to say, it was a very tiring day.","ME Route 27 Near Stratton

We started hiking at about 7:10 AM. It was overcast and the forecast was for rain but the rain pretty much held off until about 11:30 AM. So we were able to make good time in the morning. It was a pleasant hike and it was very pretty even if it was overcast. But starting at 11:30 AM, the rain came making the rest of the hiking day pretty miserable. We sloshed through mud and I slipped and fell once. Thankfully I didn’t get hurt. 
The Appalachian Trail Conservancy has a canoe with which they provide free ferries across the Kennebec River. They do this to discourage hikers from attempting to ford the river. At least one hiker drowned attempting to ford this river. There’s a problem with the ATC’s plan. They only operate the free ferry from 9:00 AM until 2:00 PM. If you arrive after 2:00 PM, you have to wait until the next morning. There are a couple of private contractors you can hire to ferry you across during off hours. That is what we did. The contractor who served us is Cheryl. She was very nice and even drove us in her car to the Sterling Inn where we are staying. After we got to the Inn, we showered and put on dry clothes and went out for dinner.

I came across a female grouse who didn’t fly away. I was able to get a couple of good pictures of her. There were some nice views to take in and we enjoyed good weather all day. At the very end, there was a thunderstorm in the area and it sprinkled a little on us but this was after we had made it to the lean-to. The lean-to overlooked Bald Mtn Pond. (Note: I would not call this body of water a pond, it is really a lake.) We had actually contemplated hiking an additional couple of miles but with the threat of storming, we decided to stay put. We could hear the loons calling at different times during the night and the bullfrogs croaked practically all night long.","Pleasant Pond Mtn Rd

Surefoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666815,"We hiked from Moxie Bald Mtn Pond Lean-to to ME Route 15 at Monson ME, 17.9 miles. Even though this day had relatively high miles compared to some of the days we’ve been doing lately, the topography did not indicate that it was going to be a strenuous day. And honestly, it wasn’t. But for some reason I hit a wall at around 1:30 PM and I was pretty sapped for the rest of my day. Even though I have hiked over 2000 of the Appalachian Trail, I still miss it on my nutritional needs every once in a while. If I am well nourished and not experiencing a lot of plantar fasciitis pain, I can usually hike pretty strongly; but introduce one or both of those factors and I slow way down.
This day contained a lot of water crossings. For me, I do not enjoy walking in soggy shoes. But I have had to learn to suck it up and get used to it. There was one river in particular in which we had to cross both the West branch and the East branch. The name of the river is the Piscataquis River. Due to all the rain in the region, this river was flowing at unusually high volume. We had been cautioned by Eric back at the Sterling Inn and subsequently by numerous SOBO’s that there was a roadwalk alternative. However, the roadwalk would add about three miles to the day. We were hoping to avoid that extra three miles but were wanting to exercise caution as well. Fortunately for Splash and I, Kidding was able to learn that a safe volume to cross the river was when it was measuring at 400 cubic meters per second. Kidding had further been able to find a website that continuously gives live-time readings of the current flow rate of that river. The only problem was we had no cell signal where we were. But Kidding was able to use her Garmin Inreach mini satellite communicator to ask a family member to check the website first thing in the morning. So it turns out the flow rate at that time was reading 456 cmpm. We deemed that close enough to the 400 limit and decided to cross the river. It was a bit intimidating walking up to that river and seeing the volume of water flowing through. But we mustered up our courage and made the crossing. The water in some places made it up almost to my waste. With that amount of water pushing against you, it forces you to brace yourself a lot. Adding to the challenge is the slippery rocks you have to walk across in the bottom of the river. It is a hair raising experience. I think we made a total of four crossings. The two most challenging were the West and East branches of the Piscatiquis. We took photos at a couple of the other crossings but at these two, our full focus was on getting across and we didn’t pull our phone/cameras out. After getting past the river crossings, the rest of the day was just about trudging through the muddy trail to make it to Monson.
Once we got to the highway crossing, we called Shaw’s Hostel for a shuttle. Their shuttle runs at the top of even numbered hours and we arrived at 2:30 PM. So we had to wait a while. But the wait was worth it. Shaw’s is a very hospitable hostel.","Moxie Bald Mtn Pond Lean-to

So during that time, I won’t be making posts.
A word about Shaw’s Hiker Hostel. This is the busiest hostel I have seen since being on the trail. There are NOBO’s and SOBO’s as well as a mix of other hikers too. They are very organized without seeming too petty about certain issues. I’ve been to hostels in which the owners seemed too anal about things that they want to control. The owners here, Poet and Hippy Chick, are laid back yet they still manage to host a large number of hikers without making them feel like little children that need to be managed. This morning, I went in the kitchen and Poet was busy cooking away and enjoying it. He’s a fantastic person. He and Hippy Chick seem to make it a point to remember everyone’s name. Oh, and by the way, the breakfast was fantastic. Three fried eggs with the white cooked and the yolk runny, bacon, homemade hash browns, and all you can eat blueberry pancakes. They have an amazingly stocked resupply and a broadly stocked hiking gear shop. This place is a don’t miss it kind of place. I hope they stay in business for as long as they want.We will be taking advantage of their food drop service in which they meet you out in the 100 mile wilderness with half of your food so you don’t have to carry all that extra weight.","Shaw’s

I was amazed at the speed with which he rattled off the information he was sharing with us in such a poetic manner. I like that guy. 
I was a little apprehensive about being in the 100 mile wilderness. It can be intimidating with all the build up before you enter it. Poet’s pep talk before he let us out was encouraging. After getting on our way, we forded at least four rivers during the day. We saw a family out hiking without any gear or provisions. This made me realize we weren’t as remote as I thought.

I looked at my watch as we were walking away from the campground. It was 7:06 AM. This is a strenuous hike with 4200 feet of ascent. But we had fantastic weather and even the mosquitoes seemed to leave us alone. We made it to the summit by around 10:45 AM. I felt like we made good time. We took pictures at the sign and then found a place to sit and have lunch. We started back down the mountain by around 11:30 AM. We decided to take the Abol Trail down. This trail is about 1.3 miles shorter than the Hunt Trail which is the route the AT takes. But the Abol Trail is very steep. It took a lot of energy to descend via this route. It made my knees hurt. The pain wasn’t in my knee joints but in the muscles around my knees. We arrived at Abol Campground by around 2:15 PM where my wife and son were waiting to pick us up. So it took us less than three hours and 45 minutes to ascend Katahdin and it took us about two hours and 45 minutes to descend. 
So finally my 2,198.4 mile journey was complete. It felt good. Maybe sometime I will take the time to write down my thoughts on completing this journey.

I can honestly say this has been the most difficult undertaking I have ever experienced. Very little can prepare a person for this kind of endeavor.

I’ve only been hiking with Kidding since around the time we started hiking in Maine although we had crossed paths several times prior. I have come to admire and respect Kidding because she is so sharp and reliable. I don’t know how to express it; but when you have been around someone 24 hours a days/seven days a week for several weeks, it is hard to say goodbye to them.
