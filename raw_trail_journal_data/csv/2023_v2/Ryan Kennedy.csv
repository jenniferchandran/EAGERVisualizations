Ryan Kennedy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661654,"So 12 years after Townie (Beka) and I attempted the AT SOBO, I’m heading out for a NOBO attempt! The stars have (mostly) aligned and I’m able to get a leave of absence from my job for just long enough to do it. I’m setting out on Monday April 10th with my 9-year-old son and my father-in-law, they’re doing at least Georgia with me and then we’ll see from there. Beka and my 7-year-old daughter will be out to support us along the way.",,View Entry,"Apr 06, Thu",0
Ryan Kennedy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661820,"Townie (Beka) and I attempted a southbound thru hike in 2011 when I got home from Iraq and out of the navy. We made it just under 800 miles and got off the trail in Harriman State Park in NY. She had been a warrior the whole way, fighting through back and knee pain, but she tweaked her ankle somewhere in CT and it just stopped being fun. We decided to head home and maybe try again some day.",,View Entry,"Apr 08, Sat",0
Ryan Kennedy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661934,"So yesterday was technically our first day on the trail but it was a short one, a mile out to Springer to start, then a mile back to the car and one last night in Dahlonega. After a nice night at the house we headed back out today (after yet another ridiculously long dirt road drive) and left in earnest after long goodbyes with Beka, Charlotte and Becky. Relatively easy hiking through here, some uphills near the end that we all struggled with, but Miles powered through and did great. No views today, though the forest is beautiful right now as spring is in full swing. Plenty of other hikers at the shelter tonight. The ladies all surprised us about halfway through the day at Long Creek Falls for one last goodbye and prayer. Great first full day out.","Big Stamp Gap

Ryan Kennedy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662000,"Long night last night, Walt had some serious equipment failures in the middle of the night and I ended up giving him my sleeping bag and putting on all the clothes I had to get through the 40 degree night. We got through okay and Becky made a trip to REI and met us at Cooper Gap to replace his equipment with some nice upgrades. Another beautiful day, but Sassafras Mountain was no joke, everyone was struggling. Miles was really discouraged on the steep climb but he pushed through and finished strong. He’s really finding he’s capable of a lot more out here. Full house at the shelter tonight, we got one of the last tent sites. Missing Beka and Charlotte, looking forward to seeing them soon.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Ryan Kennedy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662035,"So the surprises just keep coming. Walt slept well in his new gear last night, but when we woke up this morning, 6 food bags, including ours, had been stolen from the bear box during the night. The ridgerunner said in 6 years on the trail, he’s never seen anything like that. Fortunately we were able to get a ride to a nearby Dollar General and get enough food to get us to Neels Gap. After getting back on the trail we made great time to Woody Gap and enjoyed the best views yet. A storm was blowing in, so we booked it to Lance Creek to camp. Got rained on for the first time and set up the tent in rain, not fun but part of the deal. Tomorrow we climb Blood Mountain and it’s forecast to rain all day, we’ll see what happens.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Ryan Kennedy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662094,"So yet another rough night last night. Walt was really struggling with the climb in the rain out of Woody Gap and had started having afib by the time he got to Lance Creek. After calling family, it was clear he needed to get off the trail. My sister-in-law Tara drove over this morning to pick him up from Henry Gap half a mile from Lance Creek. We caught a ride with her too. After the last few days, Miles has been struggling, and with rain forecast, Blood Mountain would be a bad day. My mother-in-law Becky rented a place for us to stay in Blairsville while Walt recovers. Beka is going to slackpack Miles and me over Blood Mountain tomorrow.","Lance Creek
",Henry Gap,"Apr 14, Fri",0.50
Ryan Kennedy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662149,"Beka dropped Miles and me off back at Henry Gap to slackpack today. We were hoping it would give Miles a boost to go without a pack, and boy did it. We booked it up to Blood Mountain, he cruised the whole way. Quite a crowd at the top, but we had some great views and good pictures. While we were near the top, a stunt plane did a few loops right over the peak. We booked it down to Neels Gap where it was even more crowded and got the Red Baron pizzas we'd heard about so long, and they were pretty good. Met a few new really cool thru-hikers I hope we catch up with, though we could barely hear each other talk over the sound of the motorcycles. We met Hawk and Miles was a little starstruck, we've watched his channel for a long time. While we were waiting around for Beka to pick us up Miles decided to dance a little, and finally earned himself a trail name he likes: Happy Feet! Came back to the house and spent a great evening with the family, and Walt is feeling better today. Taking a zero tomorrow to avoid the rain. I don't love only being 31 miles in after a whole week, but while I'm still in GA we'll take all the family time we can get, the miles will come.","Henry Gap

Ryan Kennedy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662267,"After a zero in Blairsville with the family, Miles and I hit the trail again today at Hogpen Gap. We skipped ahead a few miles (which we’ll make up this fall) so we can get to Unicoi Gap in time to meet my good friend from college and his son, who will hike with us for a week. The hike up out of Hogpen wasn’t bad, but Miles was struggling after all that time off and slackpacking. We still made good time and decided to go farther than Low Gap Shelter to make tomorrow shorter, but overshot Poplar Stamp Gap, so we just hiked to the next nice looking tent site we found since we had plenty of water left, not quite at Cold Springs Gap. Another hiker joined us on this very windy evening. Hung a bear bag for the first time on the trip, and after losing one bag already, I’m semi-paranoid about losing another.  Going to get a semi-early start tomorrow to meet back up with Beka and Charlotte for a bit before they head home.","Hogpen Gap

Ryan Kennedy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662331,"Well today was a tough one, and Miles/Happy Feet hit the wall. The trail never got crazy, but there were enough ups and downs with steep parts that his body and mind just had enough. We worked our way slowly down into Unicoi Gap where Beka and Charlotte picked us up. After lunch in Helen we went back to their site at Unicoi State Park and spent the evening. It was emotional having the talk with him about going home, especially when he said he just didn’t want me to be sad and alone. I assured him I would be okay and that I could not be more proud of him, and reminded him that we crossed the 50 mile mark today. I will miss him very much, glad Dillon and Caleb will be here tomorrow. Some gnarly weather forecast for the next week, and all the delays/hiccups are starting to get really old.","Cold Springs Gap

Ryan Kennedy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662387,"After a great night at Unicoi State Park with Beka and the kids with hot dogs and s’mores, I switched packs (to a lighter one) this morning and we headed to meet Dillon and Caleb back at Unicoi Gap. It was really hard to say goodbye yet again, and this time to Miles too and for longer till the next time. But I am glad he went home, because today was easily the hardest day of hiking yet. We took our time and did a shorter day since we started late and climbed Rocky Mtn and Trey Mtn both. While I loved hiking with Miles, it was great to have adults to talk with while hiking and not hearing recaps of episodes of Phineas and Ferb. Beautiful but windy site up here on the ridge tonight, and yet another shelter at full capacity. I don’t know how people were doing this a month ago when there were double the thru hikers passing through. Really great to have Dillon and Caleb here.","Unicoi Gap
",Tray Mountain Shelter,"Apr 19, Wed",5.70
Ryan Kennedy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662538,"Well after plenty of time to think today, I’ve decided this isn’t the right time for me to do this. It’s been great having Dillon and Caleb here and a fun couple of days, but I had time to think and realized that my heart just isn’t in this any more right now. I think the bumpy start just kicked my morale to the ground and it never got up, but I also found out right before starting that my dad’s health has started rapidly declining. And I’ve told myself that though I’ll miss Beka and the kids, I’ll get used to it and we’ll meet up a lot along the way. It hit me while hiking today: I don’t want to get used to that. Everyone else I’ve encountered out here has either been young and uncommitted or in a transition phase of life or in retirement with kids out of the house. We are in the middle of everything in our lives right now, so it’s just not the right time. 
We pushed pretty hard yesterday to get to Dicks Creek Gap and took the free shuttle to Hiawassee and got a hotel room. Had dinner with Josh and Marty, some great guys we met out here. We’re getting a shuttle to Dillon’s car tomorrow and then headed home. 
I’ll do this someday hopefully, I just kinda forced it this year. Hopefully the day will come soon where the timing is right and we’ll try again. The key lesson I’ve learned is I can’t start off with family or close friends with them planning to leave after a week or two. That separation is just too much for me.","Tray Mountain Shelter
