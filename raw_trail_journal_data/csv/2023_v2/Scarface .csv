Scarface ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660592,"I rented a car from Orlando International Airport on Sunday.  This was a holiday week and I was afraid I would have an issue with renting a car.  I stood in line for over 2 hours and finally got a rental car.  Later that day I heard on the news that all the rental cars at the airport had been sold out and people who had reserved and paid for cars were just out of luck. Thankfully I picked my car up early.  I met my 2 daughters for lunch and said my goodbyes.  I left home on Monday afternoon and drove about 1 hour away from Atlanta airport where I had to return the car.  Tuesday morning I returned the car at Atlanta airport and got a ride from a shuttle driver to Amicola campground where I met up with Rebecca and her husband and Paula and her husband.  My emotions were all over the place.  Days leading up to today I was crying ,anxious, excited and scared.  Today Wednesday February 22nd I woke up at 5 am to start my first day of hiking. I slept at the campground in my Big Agnes Tent which I love , love, love.  My friend Mosetta(Teresa who completed AT 2 years ago recommended this tent). My previous tent was a Zpack duplex but I had issues with water and condensation and didn’t want to deal with this on the trail. It had rained a little last night but I was nice and dry.  It was 57 degrees and sunny and the perfect first day to start the hike. I feel a bit disorganized with my gear but this is only day 1.  I had my kchava drink for breakfast, green belly protein bar for lunch and my dehydrated chop meat and instant potatoes for dinner.  Hiked the approach trail from the campground to Black Gap shelter ,a total of 7.3 miles and I feel good. Lesson : get water when you see it on the trail.  The next water spot maybe 1/2 Mike off trail","Amicola Falls approach trail

Scarface ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660613,Last night was awakened by what sounded like a train.  I was a bit disoriented because I was on top of a mountain with no trains nearby.  It got closer and louder and then a big gust of wind blew the tent.  It was as if there was a train sound from above the sky and then gradually came closer to the ground and then the huge gust of wind.  I was a bit scared because I was always told that a tornado sounds like a train. Needless to say I was up for about an hour due to the noise.   Started hiking around 8am weather was cloudy but no rain.  As we approached Springer mountain it was raining and misting.  There was no view from Springer but got pics by the rock. Rained on and off all day. There was a gorgeous waterfall .1 mile off the trail. The last 2 miles was uphill and I was exhausted.  Finally got to the campsite in the rain. Set up my tent in the rain for the first time and did a good job. I tied my food ursack bag to a tree and hopefully it is still there in the morning    Lesson:  drink drink drink lots of water,"Black gap shelter

Scarface ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660615,I didn’t leave camp until 8:30 am.   Slept really well last night. Cloudy and sunny today and was a great day to hike.  Just started raining as we got into campsite.  Wanted to get to shelter but it was another 1.3 miles and I was just too exhausted to go any further. I have been so tired at night I haven’t been eating dinner(except for the first night). Still slow at setting up and taking down the tent but can put tent up in the rain without everything getting wet. Rebecca decided to quit hiking today.  I was shocked.  Have to rethink this whole hike now. ( Backstory- Rebecca and I met on a hike over the summer and talked about hiking the AT.  Her husband was going to bring their RV and pick her up at the trail every 5 or 6 days to resupply and shower and laundry. She invited me to hike with her and keep my resupply in the RV.  Paula was only going to hike a week and then go home.  )   Do I continue or do I go home??  I didn’t want to quit but I had to figure out what I was going to do with all the resupply I had in the RV. (Resupply in RV was a month worth or food and personal toiletries and extra hiking clothes and gear).  Lesson today : Take care of gear.  If it is wet dry out on the trail when I take food breaks.  Take time to put on rain gear and cover pack so my clothes don’t get wet and stay dry,"

Scarface ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660616,Today was an easy day.  Hiked with Paula and “Timeout” (She has a YouTube channel). Rebecca picked me up and I camped at Vogel state park.  Paula and Timeout slept at a hostel.  Went through all my stuff in RV and will mail some stuff home and some stuff I will forward to hostels or post offices for future use.,"Devils Kitchen 
",Woody gap,"Feb 25, Sat",6.10
Scarface ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660617,I met up with Paula and timeout this morning.  I slackpacked today (hike with a small pack and only carry food and water). Blood mountain is very rocky and slippery when wet and I needed to do 11 miles today so that is why I decided to slackpack.  I started around 8am and finished at 5:45pm. It was a very hard 11 miles so I am happy I didn’t have my full pack. Paula and timeout went back to the hostel. They said for $50 they got dinner and breakfast and there was a Roman tub that they could soak in.  When I finished the hike I said my goodbyes to Paula.  I had only just met her a few days ago but she gave me a small wooden cross that was very special to her. She made me cry.  She is just such a sweet person.,"Woody gap

Scarface ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660732,went to post office this morning to mail packages home and mailed a few packages forward to hostels and post offices.  Got dropped off at Neels Gap Crossing Store and started backpacking around 11am. Rained lightly all day with high winds. Was only going to go 6 miles to shelter but when I got to the sign for shelter it was another 1.2 miles off the trail. No way was I going to hike the extra miles.  Read that there was an unofficial site further so I continued to Hogpen Gap unofficial tent site. There were about 7 other tents and barely got here before dark.  I was exhausted but had to set up in the dark,"Neels Gap

Scarface ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660733,woke up about 7 am today.  Not so windy this morning and sun is out  so trying to dry out tent and clothes before I start the hike.  Have to do 10 miles today to get to next tent site.  Ups and downs on trail today look a bit easier.  Started hiking around 10:15.  All my clothes and gear did dry before I started hiking.  Only made it to an unofficial campsite just 1 mile short of the shelter.  I had to stop here because it was getting dark and only had a few minutes to setup before I lost daylight.   There was nobody else here and I had to camp all by myself.  Did not expect to have to camp by myself so early in the trip but there was nothing else I could do.  Tent site at Mile 49.1,"Hog pen Gap

Piped stream right below campsite and was 3rd person at tentsite.  Within 15 minutes about 8 more people showed up. Got here just in time and got a nice level tentsite.  I passed the Georgia/North Carolina state line today!!!  Lesson - the zipper on my sleeping bag needs to be underneath me instead of on the side dueto drafts in the zipper area which makes the bag much warmer.,"Dicks creek gap

Got to standing Indian campsite around 4pm. Hopper , girl with piper the dog Dan , goose and maverick were there.  Set up camp and had meat and mashed potatoes. After 2 days my phone was at 20% battery so I needed to charge it with my battery backup.  I looked all through my stuff and could not find the wire to charge my phone. Surprisingly I did not freak out.  I was pretty calm but knew I could not be on the trail by myself with a fully charged phone.  Since I knew 5 people at the site I asked Hopper  and he had the wire I needed.  So he lent it to me for the night so I could charge my phone.","Bly Gap

Scarface ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660740,I got up at 6 am because I needed an early start.  I have reservations at Chica and Sunset Hostel on Thursday and wanted to try to go 11 miles to a tentsite today. I started around 7:45 today. I gave Hopper his phone wire back and my phone was at 100%.  Left it on airplane mode and didn’t listen to any audiobooks today because I had to conserve the battery. It was a beautiful day and the hike was mostly switchbacks and pretty easy.    I did the 11 miles to Betty Creek Gap.  This was the prettiest campsite with a bunch of little tent sites nestled in little alcoves of the forest.   It is suppose to be very cold tonight.,"Standing Indian Campsite
",Betty Creek Gap,"Mar 07, Tue",11
Scarface ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660741,it was freezing last night!!  Went all the way in sleeping bag and shut phone off to conserve battery.  I only had 1 more day to hike before getting a wire for my phone.  Didn’t get up til after 7:30 and out of camp by 9am.  First 2 miles were awful!!  Albert mountain was a big climb with rocks do I was on my hands and knees with my pack on trying to get up the mountain.  Once I got to the lookout / fire tower it was an easy downhill. I hit the 100 Mile Marker today!!! Rock Gap Shelter was a brand new shelter and had only been open for 2 weeks and you could still smell the paint.  I need to wake up by 6 am and out of camp by 7 am to hike the 4 miles in order to be picked up at 11 am to be taken to the hostel.

(This was my 3rd zero day got to winding stair in 14 days of hiking).  It is suggested that you hike only 8-10 miles a day the first few weeks to prevent injury and pain.

Hiked to Cold spring Shelter.  I swore I would never sleep in a shelter.  ( A shelter is a 3 sided structure with a roof which usually sleeps 5-8 people.  There is no privacy and there are lots of snoring going on.   Mice usually come into the shelter at night looking for food.   No way would I be able to sleep with mice running around.  Well it happened. I could not set up my tent because it was so wet and cold. 3 guys and 1 other girl in the shelter.  Went to bed at 5:30 pm because it was so cold.  Slept most of the night and only got up 3 times but went right back to sleep.,"Wine Spring Camp

Only had to go 3 1/2 miles to get a ride. I never walked so fast in my life.  At the pickup road was trail magic ( 3 people who brought food and drinks for free to the hikers.  They were very sweet and had plenty of food for the taking).

Scarface ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661721,"Since my last night on the trail was freezing I needed to get off the trail and take a break for 2 weeks and wait for the weather to warm up just a bit.  I also planned on skipping the smokies  because the weather was so bad. It would be in the teens and 20’s and snowy, Icy and just miserable.  I rented a car and went home for 2 weeks.  I plan on making up the part I skipped in June. I need to go home again in June for my daughters graduation and the smokies will be much more enjoyable to hike in June.  Drove a rental car from Orlando Florida yesterday to Asheville Regional airport in North Carolina. Shuttle driver picked me up at 8am this morning and took me to Hot Springs. This is a quaint little town and the AT goes right thru the town.   There was a horrible wind storm last night and the whole town lost power.  Meet up with Paula at Laughing Hostel and we started hiking around 10am.  It was a beautiful day to start backpacking but it was all uphill and very tiring.  After being home for 2 weeks it was like starting all over again. I lost my “trail legs”. Hiked 8.3 miles today.  Staying at Rich Mountain Camp which is on top of mountain and it was very windy and had a hard time putting up my tent.

While thinking this through another hiker came up from behind and said I was going the wrong way!!   If I had slide down I do not know what was at the bottom of the rock face nor would I have been able to get back up.   Someone was watching over me thankfully.  Huge Lesson learned today - double and triple check for blazes before you climb up or down any rocks!!  Got to Jerry’s Cabin Shelter after 5:30 and while setting up my tent saw Dan (dang bird). He said the smokies weren’t too hard but was very cold and icy.  Also found out there was a side trail off the AT that skipped the rocks I encountered today and that some people use the side trail to avoid the rocks or when the weather is bad.,"Little Laurel Shelter
