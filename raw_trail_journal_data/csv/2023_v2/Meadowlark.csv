Meadowlark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660112,"With 21 days to go I feel ready. I've reached that point where I'm tired of research and planning. It's time to get hiking.
I've been doing 4 mile day hikes with a full pack. I hope to get in a rain hike before departing to test rain gear and set up/tear down of my camp.

Meadowlark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660167,"I didn't get the rain I was hoping for during day light hours. There was a light sprinkle however that gave me a good feeling for set up and tear down in the rain. I will try to get a 8-9 mile hike in tomorrow. I am in the Columbia, SC area so our trails are flat to rolling. That's all for now.

Meadowlark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660191,"On Thursday I got a 7 mile hike in with full pack. I had to cut it short due to a late start and the park locking the gates at 4:30.
First 3.5 went pretty easy. After a short break the second half was harder.
My practice has helped to organize my gear to have handy what I need while on the trail. Things like glasses, rain gear, and knife are more assessable.
I've learned not to bend over with a full pack. I came close to going down head first. I also learned to prepare for boredom if in camp alone.
Getting things at home in order has been a major priority too. I want no worries for my wife. Yard work, cars, and scheduled maintenance are complete. 
I'll post one more before setting out on the trail.

Meadowlark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660374,"The week started out fun with a Send Off party at my daughter’s home. Prizes were given for AT trivia, best hiker outfit (I was excluded) and guessing the weight of my pack.
We are spending 2 nights in Marietta and the plan is for my friend Beau to drive me to the Springer parking lot tomorrow for the start. He will join me for the hike back to Springer then back to the lot to retrieve my pack. The forecast is not looking nice. My biggest concern is the wind, 15-25 mph with gusts to 45. We plan to wake and evaluate the weather then. There is always the option of a 1 day delay.

Meadowlark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660432,Into Day3. Day 1 I was driven to the Springer parking lot by my friend Beau Henry. He mastered the winding mountain roads in rain and fog. Rain and fog all day for the hike to Hawk Mt. Day 2 was great weather but pretty hard on these old legs. A lot of steep up and down. On my way to Jarred Gap tonight.,,View Entry,"Mar 05, Sun",0
Meadowlark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660471,"Spent last night at Lance Creek. Saw 4 tent spots not 6 as published. We ended up with maybe 12. Up and down Blood Mt today into Neels Gap. Had pizza and a shower and will bunk here tonight. Unfortunately the downhill from Blood Mt took a further toll on my knee and I decided to call it quits. My dear wife is on her way to get me tomorrow. I had a good experience, learned a lot and met nice people.

Meadowlark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660672,Disappointed that I called off the thru hike I'm thinking of switching to a section hike approach. I'm just not ready to give up that easy.,,View Entry,"Mar 12, Sun",0
