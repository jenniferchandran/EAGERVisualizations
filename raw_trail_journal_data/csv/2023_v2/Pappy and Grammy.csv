Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659050,"Last year's hike from Amicalola Falls to Woody Gap was inspirational.  We had intended to go to Neel's Gap but had a family emergency and headed home.  This year we are starting in Waynesboro, PA and hiking to Duncannon.  Once we completely retire, we will hike longer sections.  Our son came along for the first few miles last year but hope to have more family members join us in 2023.  We had wittled down our pack weight to just under 20 lbs each and that got us up those hills a little bit easier.  Made some friends last year which is always one of our favorite parts of the journey.",,View Entry,"Oct 26, Wed",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659275,"This year we will travel first to the Boston area to visit family and then head South to Waynesboro, PA.  Waynesboro is where we finished a hike from Harpers Ferry a few years ago.  We hope to park our car there and hike to Duncannon and then get a shuttle back to the car.  This isn't a bad hike it appears from others videos on YouTube so we hope to do it in a week.  Our main goal is to keep knocking off sections of the AT.  I believe we better tackle New Hampshire next as it does look tough.  The ups are rough but the downs sometimes are harder on our knees.",,View Entry,"Nov 02, Wed",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659332,Here is my wife at the top of Springer Mtn.  We camped at the shelter area and had a wonderful night.  There was a lost teenager that we tried to help find and he was found safe.  The night before we stayed at the lodge and had a great dinner with our son who was there for a job gig.  He walked the first few miles with us.  This year we will be less steep but a few days longer.  We had a trail angel a few years ago that brought us to the Cobblestone Inn to ride out some rainy nights.  This is where we will start in 2023.,,View Entry,"Nov 07, Mon",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659616,"After the Holidays we have to kick our workout up a notch.  More stretching and walking.  It has been below zero here in Iowa for a week and we will probably do some snowshoeing this week.  Can't decide whether to bring our Copper Spur UL3 or the Triplex.  The Triplex is much lighter and you can set it up in the rain but the Copper Spur is a quicker set up though a pound heavier.  Took the Triplex to Georgia and enjoyed the lightness going up the mountains.  We will be in Southern PA in May so hopefully it won't be too hot.They always say don't pack your fears.  For us our fears are too much weight, mosquitoes, lack of water.  We added the BeFree and the Thermacell Mosquito repelller which works great.  Last summer in Georgia we had 20lb packs.  This summer there are several places to get food so hoping to trim a pound.The picture is of Neels Gap.  Did some shopping there.  My first trip I got sandwiches, cokes, snacks and rented a cabin nearby.  Fond memories.",,View Entry,"Dec 26, Mon",0

Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660186,"The planning is going well.  We have decided to take our Copper Spur HV UL3 as we have heard that the tenting spots will be small or wood platforms.  We love the Triplex but it does have a big footprint.  I have been watching Krizakoni's videos showing the shelters and their components which has been very helpful.  Thanks Krizakoni!  Ordered some new rolltop bags as ours have holes in them.  Southern PA looks like fun, not too many climbs with some fun rock mazes.We have been working out four times per week and getting in some longer prep hikes.  It has been cold and icy so it is harder to prepare.  Have purchased all our food except the lunches.  We will pick up tortillas, tuna, cheese, salami, PB, jelly, and snacks just before leaving.  Looks like we will be just under 20lbs with food and water with the heavier tent.  We both wear Altra Lone Peak shoes which work well for us.  We have been following the early hikers and it looks like they have had some good weather but will get a cold spell.We hike because it is in our blood.  Ever since our first hike we long for the trail.  Our shorter prep hikes help get us through but we long for the mountains.  Not too many in Iowa!",,View Entry,"Feb 18, Sat",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661461,"Time to spray the Permethrin on the clothes and plan the packing.  We also spray waterproofing on some items just in case.  Bringing some dehydrated raspberries as none will be ready to eat with a Spring hike.  Lots left to do!I am the worst at slowly sneaking in items I think would be fun to bring along and then later regretting on the first uphill.  We do the system the previous summer of putting in three piles; used items frequently, seldom used items, never used items.  Still though some new invention worms its way into our packs.  We are up to over 19 pounds, mostly snack items like BelVita biscuits and Sweet and Salty bars.  Hopefully I will eat most before the first big climb.  Hope all the hikers are faring the weather okay.  We wish them well.",,View Entry,"Mar 31, Fri",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662421,"Hard to believe it is almost time for our next Section hike!  It has been great fun following this year's class of hikers.  We are starting to make our final packing and preparing to make the drive to PA.  We will begin where we left off several years ago.  Last year we did GA and had an amazing hike.  This year we hope to make some new friends and cross off another section.  We are thinking of NC/TN or maybe NH while we are still young enough to do the Whites.  We will see.This year we are bringing battery operated air pumps for our sleeping pads, just for fun.  We will make sure to inflate before Hiker Midnight so as not to disturb.  We are right around 20lbs each for pack weight and are bringing two light hammocks for lounging so do have a few luxuries.   Our best to those hiking now and those considering a hike.",,View Entry,"Apr 20, Thu",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664280,"We had a terrific hike in Southern PA.  Made many new friends like Quazi, Eygore, Generic, Holiday, Elle, and more.  Great weather, only one day of light rain.  Beautiful flowers like Pink Lady Slippers and Azaleas.  Met the caretakers for Tumbling Run Shelter.  We finished our hike with a trip to Middlesex Diner and over ate of course.  More pictures to come!  Have already started planning next year's hike, maybe Whites or Delaware Water Gap.",,View Entry,"May 23, Tue",0

Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664283,"Pleasant stroll to Caldonia State Park where we reserved a campsite.  The view from Chimney Rocks was amazing and helped to breakup the day.  Or friend tripped on a root just before Hwy 30 but he is okay.  I guess I overpacked by a pound or two of items we never used, next year I will scrutinize a bit more.",,View Entry,"May 23, Tue",0
