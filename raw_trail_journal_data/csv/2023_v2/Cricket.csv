Cricket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546929,"All the advice I've read about endeavoring to hike the Appalachian Trail is that I must be committed to the hike, and that means going public with my intentions. This is a hard step because right now the hike is just an idea, planning and gear selection is fun. Reading books about the trail, reading the trail journals of 2016 thru hikers is interesting. But actually committing to the hike is very hard. I will hopefully be granted a 6 month leave from work, but if they won't allow it then I will have to leave my job that I love and have done for 12 years and look for something else after the hike. And what if I get injured or end up leaving the trail early, as so many hikers do, then what?With this entry I am taking the step of letting the public know my intentions, and the hike becomes a real. My husband would say that the dream became real 3 months ago when the tent, sleeping bag, trekking poles and such started arriving in boxes on our front porch. Or when he saw me slim down 20 pounds because I knew that my knees would be happier hiking if the body weighed a bit less. Or when I started dehydrating the garden vegetables. Either way, he is beginning to tell about my future hike to his work buddies so somewhere along the way he went from, ""sure, honey, hike the trail"", to ""your actually serious, aren't you?""So, Public, you now know my intentions. I look forward to sharing my journey with you. Happy reading!",,View Entry,"Aug 26, Fri",0
Cricket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546938,"I have never carried a backpack and hiked. I went to college before backpacks were popular, and we all carried our books. So when I sent to our local outfitters to try a backpack on it was quite an experience. The kind saleswoman did not laugh at me when she asked what I needed the pack for and I said I was planning on thru hiking the AT. She did not laugh at me when I could not answer (or understand) the question of what my dry weight was. And she didn't laugh when she handed me a 20# weighted pack to try on and I had no idea how to get the thing on my back-it seemed very heavy! She ended up placing the pack on a table and having me back up to the pack, throw on the shoulder straps, then buckle the hip belt, then the sternum straps, then adjust the load lifters. I realized later that this method is the equivalent to using a step ladder to get on the back of a horse-only done by the elderly and overweight. Hummm. I now know that the young and fit pick the pack up by the top loop and place it on their upper thigh, then put the first shoulder strap on, then the next one, then continue to buckle/adjust. I left the store that day without a pack, and I thought I heard laughter as the door was closing....Anyway, I still have a pack to purchase and am finding some interesting options online where I can have it delivered to my home (I love getting home and finding those packages on the porch)and try it on in private.",,View Entry,"Aug 27, Sat",0
Cricket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546939,"This site requires 3 journal entries before a hiker's journal becomes public and is able to be read by all you lovely people. I am doing all three in one day so that my intentions become public (see entry #1). I thought I'd tell you how I come up with Cricket as my Trail name. I knew a name bestowed by other hikers might not be as flattering as I'd like, and so began the process of renaming myself. A girl at work calls me KitKat, so that was at the top of my list until I read that there is a trail angel/hiker that goes by that name, and I don't want her wonderful image to be blurred with mine. I was going to use something like snail or worm because I am likely to be one of the slowest hikers on the trail, or “kneedy” because of my bad knees, but these trail names seem rather depressing and negative. So I started to think about some positive names: gorgeous, lovely, or fantastic. That way other hikers could say, “there’s gorgeous”, or “that’s fantastic”, which would be pretty cool, but maybe misleading.  “Hope” was in the running because I hope to hike, I hope to finish, I hope my foot and knees will be OK, I hope not to get attacked by a bear/snake/moose/crazy serial killer.    Frosty was in the running because I am always hot and like cool temps better, and it sounds similar to my last name. But that got a cool response from my family. Get it? Cool response?Cricket starts with same hard ""k"" sound as my real name, so maybe I'll realize someone is talking to me, unlike ""gorgeous"" which would have taken me months to catch on to. Also, I read that crickets have tubular shaped bodies and round heads, which I must say is probably how people describe me, and they make noise at night (all those who have sleep apnea can appreciate that the sound of a Cricket is a mild term for what we put our sleeping partners through each night. I'm sure my earned trail name would have been much worse. Think about what your trail name would be and why. It's not so easy to think of one. Hopefully you like Cricket.",,View Entry,"Aug 28, Sun",0
Cricket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549993,"Saturday my daughter and I walked a 13 mile trail,which turned into a 15 mile walk for us as we found two stray dogs and missed a turn and walked a mile out of our way. Just when we were trying to decide on what to do with the dogs they ran off to greet another group of people. That is also when we chose to consult the map and found we had made a wrong turn. Lesson learned: always stay focused.Anyway we had a lovely hike in perfect weather and my daughter had the good idea to call her father and request a steak dinner for when we got back home. We were obviously pampered by the weather, dinner, hot shower and comfy bed Saturday night so on Sunday, feeling like I needed to put myself thru a little more discomfort to try and mimic AT conditions I woke my daughter and said, ""let's do it again!"". To which she replied, ""you go without me"". So I did. It was another fantastic day for hiking and covered the 13 miles without getting lost. So I have decided that I LOVE the trekking poles, love the zip off pants that I purchased, love the merino wool quarter zip top,but still need to find shoes that will not crunch my toes. I am wearing a pair of Solomon waterproof hiking shoes that are very comfortable for the first seven miles but then I notice the little toes are being crunched a bit. I did not get blisters, but the toes hurt and that will be a big problem on the AT. I have heard that Keen's have more toe room so that will be my next pair. Found out that if you are an REI member they will accept returns on shoes for up to a year, so am definitely going to try out shoes thru REI. We are planning to overnight next weekend or some weekend soon to test the cooking end of my equipment, which is just the ability to boil water, but I would hate to leave any stone unturned, so to speak. I also want to try hanging my food bag. This will be one of my biggest obstacles because I can't throw worth a lick. Even in my younger days I couldn't throw a softball across the school gym. Across, not the length of, and I tried this very thing in middle school as part of the Presidential Fitness Testing the school was required administer to all students. I guess they were trying to prove that TV watching in adolesence was detrimental to one's health. Which I'm sure it is, but the follow up is I'll be hiking the Appalachian Trail soon, so put that in my secret dossier.I will be sure to let you know how the bear bag hanging goes. Until then-Cricket",,Caesar Creek Perimeter trail,"Oct 01, Sat",0
Cricket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551935,"I've had a lot of questions from friends and family regarding my journal entries, so I will be writing about the trail itself and addressing concerns they have about the trip. I included a map of the AT, which runs from Springer Mountain, GA to Mount Katahdin in Maine. The trail can get re-routed at any time for various reasons, but remains approximately 2190 miles long and runs thru several National and State Parks. The trail itself is well blazed with white painted 2""X 6"" strips, usually on trees and rocks. When the trail runs thru a town the AT emblem is used and can be found on any surface including signposts, or embedded into the sidewalk. In the New England states where the trail is above treeline and foggy conditions are frequent the trail is marked by stone cairns, which are little formed ""pyramids"" made from stones. I will not be relying solely on the blazes to navigate as I will have a AT guide book and a phone APP, both of which have the entire length of the trail mapped out, as well as the location of shelters, tent sites, water supplies, hostels and towns near the trail. Statistically half of hikers attempting a thru hike (Thru Hike is a term for a person attempting to hike the entire length of the trail in one attempt, or year) will quit the trail somewhere in Virginia. About 1/4 of the entire trail is located in Virginia and hikers spend so much time in that state that they get what is referred to as the ""Virginia Blues"". Because it takes so long to hike thru Virginia many hikers feel that aren't making any progress, the honeymoon phase of the hike is over, and it is a mental challenge that most hikers face just to continue the journey. Another statistic I found interesting is takes 7 months for women my age to complete their thru hike. I hope to average 15 miles a day of hiking, which should leave plenty of time to take days off in towns along the way.I will be leaving in Mid March on this journey and I have read enough to know that I will need sunscreen at the beginning of the hike because the trees have not gotten their leaves yet, that for the first two months I can expect temperatures to range from high of 80s to low of mid teens in the higher elevations, and that the trail gets a lot of rainfall because of the mountains, and can get very bad thunderstorms as well. The trail summits Mount Washington in New Hampshire where wind speeds of over 231 miles per hour were recorded-the highest wind speed every recorded on earth, and where snow is possible any month of the year. Though bear encounters are what people first think of as the most dangerous animal on the trail, it is actually the tick that ends most thru hikers dreams. Ticks the size of a fleck of pepper can bring on Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain Spotted fever and other illnesses. And because the tick is so small and hard to find on oneself it often goes unnoticed until the flu like symptoms and lethargy set in. Other dangers include two poisonous snakes that are found on the trail, the Rattlesnake and the Copperhead. Still, the bears and snakes want to avoid human interaction if they can, but the tick will seek us out. Generally thru hikers will sleep at or tent near shelters, which are three sided huts made of wood or stone and usually have a water supply nearby. The shelters can fill up quickly, so hikers need to carry a tent or hammock as a back up.    Hanging your bag of food out of the reach of bears and rodents is necessary if you want to eat the next day. Access to towns where food can be resupplied are usually 3-4 days apart and usually require a hiker to get/hitch a ride into town. Hikers will occasionally stay at a hostel or hotel while in town where laundry can be done and a shower can be had, as well as eat a good meal. Hiker meals on the trail consist of the lightest most calorie filled food items that can be found. Cooking is limited to boiling water, so hikers will bring one small pot and a ""stove"" of some type. Dehydrated meals where you tear the top off the foil bag and add boiling water, wait 20 minutes and eat right out of the bag are the easiest. Mac-N-Cheese is a staple, made with water only, no butter or milk. Hikers lose weight because they cannot carry enough food calories to cover the calories burned while hiking, making town trips an excellent time to pig out and make up for the calorie deficit. My cooking system is a tin can stove that will burn Denatured alcohol to boil the water then add to couscous, pasta sides and rice dishes. Also, I plan on a lot of Pop Tarts and Nutella!Water is found along the trail in the form of springs, streams and occasionally a hand pump. I will be carrying both a water filter to filter out the particles, and Aqua Mira drops, which kill bacteria. Hikers must be careful of water near pollutants, such as farms with chemical runoff water as the filters and drops do not remove chemicals.There are people along the trail who help hikers in different ways, and they are referred to as Trail Angels. Trail Angels will leave coolers of food or drinks along the trail for hikers to stumble across (known as Trail Magic), or set up food tents at road crossing/parking spots where the trail crosses and serve whole meals. They also will pick up hikers and give them rides to town and back to the trail. There are many ways a person can help a hiker and become a Trail Angel, and they highly regarded in the hiker community. Many hikers come back to the trail yearly so that they can be Trail Angels, too, because it had such a powerful impact on them when they received the Magic. It is getting late so I'm going to wrap this up. Just want to say that I have slept in the tent on a cold 34 degree night and the tent and sleep system worked well, though there was lots of condensation inside the tent in the morning. I can successfully boil water with my alcohol stove. I have been walking 4-5 miles most morning before work, with the 13 mile wooded hike on Saturdays and a 6 mile walk on Sundays. Have yet to fully pack my pack, but it will be a tight fit for sure. Not sure how other hikers are fitting everything in. The sleeping bag takes up 1/3 of the pack and after clothes, stove kit, tent, camp shoes, medical/hygiene kit, head light, sleeping bag liner, toilet paper, water bottle, filter-you get the idea-there isn't much room left for food. No wonder hikers lose weight! Have to figure out how to pack it all better. As far as training to throw the bear bag line to hang my food, I will just have to learn when I get out there. Wish me luck. Cricket",,View Entry,"Nov 28, Mon",0
Cricket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553376,"57 days until I will be leaving Springer Mountain. I still try to hike 3 to 5 miles in the mornings before work and try to get in a long hike on the weekends, but with the holidays and icy conditions, plus the bad cold I just got over training has slowed down quite a bit. I wont walk when it is icy because I don't want to get an injury.The photo was taken in Washington near Seattle where I was able to hike the Tolt Pipeline trail located practically in my daughter's backyard. It is an East/ West trail with views of Cascades to the East and Seattle to the West. The trail is mostly used for off road bicyclists and equestrians but all I saw were hikers. It had gotten fairly cold for Seattle and snowed a few inches so the schools shut down as the city does not have a way to treat roadways of ice. On one of my hikes I took several pictures of the heavy frost that coated everything. Wish I could share them as they were kinda ""artsy"" and I was happy with them, but I don't know how to have more than one picture connected to each journal entry. Still trying to pack my backpack and have everything fit. My total weight with food and water should be under 30# but the pack will not close on top and the only thing I can think of is to keep my pack rain cover on at all times. I have been focused on my ipod, getting new faster beat songs on my playlist-sorry Adele and Josh (Groban), but your songs just won't help me get up the mountains! I have also downloaded a couple books-on-tape. I want something to listen to at night while I come to terms with camping on my own and scary night noises.I am hovering between being excited and fearful, wondering what was I ever thinking that I could do this, especially on my own. But I have decided to trust in Him. As I told a co-worker, I needs to practice what I refer to as ""falling backwards"". Taken literally it is a trust exercise where you partner up and one person falls backward and the partner catches them from behind before they hit the floor. Of course I know that God is capable of ""Catching"" me, but my willingness to ""fall"" is what needs developed. Thus does not mean I think I should jump off a mountain and expect God to protect me, but I do feel that He has placed things in my heart throughout my life that I did not follow up on because I would not ""fall backwards"" and trust that He would catch me and things would be OK. Anyway, in 57 days I will be falling backward big time!",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Mon",0
Cricket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555324,"Last week my youngest daughter told me that her Spring Break starts the same week I was planning to start my AT hike, and that she would like to join me for a few days. Such awesome news! So the plan is now to leave one day earlier and start hiking on Monday, arriving around noon Thursday at Neels Gap, where she will head home and I will continue on my way, probably crying, missing her and feeling all alone. So let me tell you a little about Lauren. She is currently a Junior in college studying Biology. She is very active, not much of a TV watcher, and loves the outdoors. This summer will be her third summer working as a white water rafting guide for ACE Adventures in West Virginia, working on the New River. The guides get a primitive campsite on the grounds, so she has basically lived out of a tent for the past two summers. I have gone on several of her trips and I can testify that she works HARD from 7am to 6pm, lifting the rafts on and off the trailers, getting the guests ready, guiding on the river, setting up the guest lunches, then putting all the gear and rafts away at the end of the day. She also works there as a Mountain Bike guide, but I have never taken one of those trips. She is also learning Mountaineering. Last May she summited Mount Hood, in Oregon, and this year she plans to summit Mount Rainier in Washington.So I told her that we need to pick out a trail name, and she said she wanted to earn one on the trail. I'm not sure 3 days will be enough time to get a trail name. I suggested Guide, or Sacagawea, or Ace, or Class 5, but she just looked at me funny. I hope to upload a photo of her, but adding pictures to this journal is always troublesome.Anyway, I have turned in my 2 weeks notice at work and my last day is March 8th. I have gotten more positive responses to the news of my AT hike than negative ones, and am surprised at how many people confessed that they always wanted to hike the AT, and several asked for this website so that they can follow my journey. I will post as often as I can given that I will need cell phone service to post. My next post will be if a couple of weeks when I start the trip. -Cricket",,View Entry,"Feb 28, Tue",0
Cricket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556436,"Wednesday March 8th was my last day of work. I packed up all my belongings and said my goodbyes and began thinking of all the things that still needed done before leaving for the trail. Thursday morning we got an early call from family letting us know that our wonderful stepmother had just passed away only a short time ago. Though my father married her after all his own children were grown, she became another mother to us and helped our family, fractured by divorce, mend and I think we siblings have remained closer than we would ever have been had she not been in our lives, and God sent the perfect mate to my father. The funeral was a loving and wonderful tribute to her life and she will be sorely and forever missed. So it is with a heavy heart that my daughter and I begin out journey. We are leaving by car this morning and I will post how our first day of hiking went ASAP. We stayed at a B&B last night as the weather was to be 18 degrees with 40 mph wind gusts.

Cricket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556743,"We were dropped off at Springer mountain parking lot atound noon on Wednesday. It was very cold, about 20 degrees, and I slipped on ice on the way up to the summit. When one falls with over 30 lbs strapped to one's back you simply dont fall, you get slammed down. So as I fell face first I saw a tiny nubby stump and thought ""will it hit my teeth or go into my eye? "" but fortunately it hit my cheek. Very lucky. That night it dropped into the teens with lots of wind. We stayed with 5 other hikers at a cemetery with a picnic pavillion. I set up my tent in the pavillion, lauren slept in the rafters on plywood, which was out of the wind, and 3 guys slept on the privy floor. Yep, it was so cold they slept in the outhouse. I shivered so hard my back hurt, but we survived. I stoked the coals from the night fire and had a nice fire going when the rest of the hikers woke. While trying to warm my feet I burned a whole in one of my socks. Didnt even notice-another hiker had to tell me thar my foot was on fire. Hiked about 8 miles, though only 7 AT miles since you have to retrace your steps getting to Springer summit and back from the parking lot.

Cricket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556748,"As I mentioned, we woke from a very cold night and got off around 10am. We hiked over a few tough climbs and it was slow going. I was tired from nit having slept much and my appetite is non existent. We kept going though and the weather improved. We ""lost"" a fellow hiker named Sydney who was from Canada. She stopped to mend some hot spots on her foot but she never caught back up to us. We found out later that she called someone for a ride off the mountain. Not sure if she will be back. We hiked to a srealth spot on Justus Mountain where we had a beautiful view of the sun going down. I'm sure the view was lovelg but we fell asleep before it set. I was in my tent and Lauren was finishing her dinner when I heard a clink of metal against rock, then a shout of ""oh, no!"", followed by the sound of her cook pot hurling down the mountain, the clinck of rocks, followed by the rustling of leaves. Hlwe were high up and the pot fell for 10 seconds. Thats a long way to go down to retrieve it, so needless to say we are now sharing mine.We met a few more hikers, Ned, korea, igloo, and raisin.

We were attempting to get to Lance Creek campsite as it is the last camping allowed for an 8 mile stretch unless you hike with a bear cannister,which we dont have. He have been hanging our food in the trees in dry bags. My first attempt at this was frustrating as I cant throw and the line would catch in the wrong spot and when I would yank on the line to get it unstuck from the tree then the rock bag tied to the end of my line would slingshot right back at me.

We then went to dinner and ordered copious amounts of food, then left with over half in a to go carton. It seemed as though we were hungry....
Next stop was WalMart to buy detergent to wash my clothes that I had worn for 4 straight days. Unfortunately the laudrymat closed at 8pm and the hotel bathtub is now disgustingly dirty and my clothes are strung up around the room to dry. Lauren has calculated that we need to leave here by 9am so she can get to work. I just want to sleep on this mattress with 4 pillows. On the trail for a pillow I put all the clothes I'm not wearing in a stuff sack and use it as a mini pillow. That works OK until it's 15 degrees and I wearing everything I have to bed, then there isnt a pillow anymore. 
Today we made it up and over Blood Mountain with an elevation of 4457 feet. It was a hard climb up and an even more trying descent. Both of Laurens knees got tendonitis and it was slow going as she basically used her hiking poles as crutches. She said she felt like Walter Jr on the show Breaking Bad. She's hobbling like an old person and used the electric cart at WalMart. 
Anyway, it had rained overnight and we set out hiking in a dense fog, eerie and awesome at the same time, and by the time we summited Blood Mountain the sun had come out and the view was breathtaking.

Cricket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557133,"Last night was so windy as we were camped on a ridge. The trees blew in waves across the mountains and it sounded like incoming jet planes landing and taking off continually all night. We all got little sleep because of it. I finally put on my earbuds and listened to music and that helped me fall asleep. Woke to my tent laying on top of me blown down by the winds. About 3 miles into the hiking to day we received trail majic! John and Al at tray gap were serving hot dogs and soda, and I thank them. They even had chairs to sit on, which just makes one feel civilized. It was hot today and the hikers were taking rest breaks in the shade all along the trail. We only made 9 miles and the threat of rain made us stop. There are two ladies with named Caboose a1nd Bruiser who are section hikers from New England planning on going to the NC border, then I will loose them too, but for now they have been fun company and we arw camping together tonight. There are flash flood warnings tonight for the town and it is thundering as I type. Oh, hung my bear bag on the 3rd try so I'm getting better. It doesnt sound hard to do, just tie a rock on your cord and throw it over a branch about 20 feet high. Easy, right? Now let me describe what really happens in no particular order: you miss the branch. Often. When you finally get the perfect throw then the remaining 30 feet of rope has caught on brush and you watch as your rock, thrown perfectly and headed right over the chosen branch, abruptly stop in flight and zoom right back to earth. Or you simply are stupid and hold the end of your line and the same thing happens. Or you give it enough line to get the rock over the branch but because you held onto the end of the rope the rock sling shots around the branch several times and gets hopelessly caught and you have to cut the line, leave it in the tree and start over. There are many examples of this at every campsite. The final glorious goof up is when the line goes over the branch but either too close to the tree trunk (bears can climb trees so it needs hung 10 feet from the trunk) and you hank on the line to get it back and retry, but the rock hurtles directly for your head. Should be easy but it takes practice for sure.

But God provided me well as the night before in the high winds my tent collapsed on me and Jamison, a fellow ex-chef with a 3"" pony tail on the top of his head, said I should weigh each stake down with a big rock or the winds at the altitude we are at will pull the stakes out enough to cause the collapse. So I did as suggested and the tent held firm through the night. We packed it up and by 9am were off hiking. Had one strenuous climb and then the rest was typical AT up and downs. Caboose, Bruiser and I hiked a nero to Dicks Creek Gap where a shuttle driver picked us up and brought us in to Hiawassee, Ga. They are hiking on in the morning and I will stay one more night here at the Holiday Inn and meet up with my husband and he will bring me some resupply. A Nero day is when a hiker hikes only a few miles, today we dad just a little over 6 miles, and a Zero day is a complete day off from hiking, though we still have to do laundry and walk to the grocery store, etc. 
We ate dinner at an all-you-can-eat buffet. The food was not great but the baked chicken and salad bar was good. The 3 of us ate with another hiker named Sigh (Cy?) Who hiked 800 miles of the AT a few years ago but stopped short due to the mental challange of such an endeavor. So she is at it again and has 6 months leave to get it done. 
I hope she makes it this time.

Cricket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557537,Got dropped off Dicks Creek Gap and was hiking by 11:00. Made it to the campsite called Bly Gap at mile marker 78.3. Hiked alone today but it was easier now that I had rest and some food. What a difference. Could have hiked farther but the next campsite is 3 miles away and at 4562 feet. I'd rather be here at 3840 feet as it is chilly and windy and only gets worse with elevation. There are only 2 other tents here and both hikers are in them sleeping. My hubby agreed to help get pictures loaded into the journal so hopefully tonight or tomorrow the previous entries will have pictures to go with them. -Cricket.,"Dicks Creek Gap

It was like, ""good morning. Now go climb a mountain"". It was a tough climb, and got to 5400 feet at Standing Indian Mtn, but there were no views to be had because of the constant drizzle and dense fog. 
The forest had many areas of burning with blackened trunks and underbrush. There were also patches of moss covered rocks to navigate. Had a coke a trail majic from a 2013 thru hiker. They were going to have hot dogs, too, but were still assembling a brand new grill and I didnt want to wait on that. Who goes to the middle of a forest and tries to assemble a grill on the fly? Ex-military, thats who.
Had a nice tent site and slept pretty well. I was always concerned about night noises, you know, spooky hooting and leaves rustling ( bear or mice), but when you camp with others the loudest noise are all the air mattresses squeaking as we toss and turn all night, and of course there is the constant zipping of tents for forest potty breaks. 
Anyway, i am trying to get caught up with posts because of the rain all day I cant pull out my phone when there is a signal, and at the last couple tent sites i did not have a signal. Thanks for bearing with me-Cricket.","Bly Gap

The county privides these shuttles for hikers and for just $3 I got a ride tofranklin 10 miles from the trail. The driver recommended the Sapphire Inn so for $50 i have a king size bed and hot shower. What else do I need? I went to McD's for food while they finished cleaning the room. Then I did town chores which include visiting the local laundrymat, resupply at the dollar general store, and shower. Met another hiker named Foghat at laundry who also is using Trail journals, though I havent read any of his entries. My rainpants ripped, but they were cheap pants bought at wal mart so what could i expect, so i walked to the local Franklin outfitters and will be sporting a new lovely green, or citron, rain skirt. It will be easier to put on and take off on the trail as putting on pants in the rain over clunky hiking shoes turned out to be a tripping hazzard. I will be so fashionable here on the trail. Combine that will my new abilities of pooping in the woods, blowing snot out of my nose directly on to the ground and not showering for 4 days in a row and I am becoming QUITE THE LADY. Or at least the perfect mate for Sassquach.
There is a free breakfast at the Baptist church in the morning so if I can be ready by 7:15 they will sent a van to pick us up and return us by 8:15 so we can get a 9 o'click MCT shuttle back to the trail. The next 5 miles are up, up ,up so I plan for a low mileage day- must climb from 3690 feet to 5001. Yuck.

So nice of them to offer to shuttle everyone there, feed them, then return them to thier hotels. Got to the Gap and started climbing by 10:00. Had to go up about 1000 feet. About 1/3 of the way up, just when I thought I might be at the top, the trail crossed a forest road and I saw the trail on the other side and it eent straight up again. I loudly said the ""F"" word, then noticed another hiker just a little way away getting water. He asked if I was OK, and I may have mentioned my distraught at the never ending mountain, and he took pity on me. (God provides) and he gave me something to help called GU. Its any energy gel sold in little packets. He aid to eat it 20 minutes prior to exertion, then hurried on before I needed more help, like an ambulance service.

Campfires are a treat because hikers do not have the time and energy, generally, to gather the wood. Sad, really, but the wood has to be collected a ways away since all the good stuff has been previously burned.

We walked along the ridge, then there was the burned sides, then the sides fell away making the path very narrow. You can see the back of Short Straw, who got his name jokingly that he drew the short straw and ended up hiking with his aunt. Her name is hiking home because she lives in Maine. They left a week before me but have had some foot and knee issues that slowed them down. They hike faster but the same mileage so we've ended up together since Franklin. We are at the NOC for the night and it is a mecca for outdoor enthusiasts-they have a kayak course on the river, white water rafting, bicyclists, hikers, and more. I ate lunch with Hiking home and Short Straw and PaPa Smurf, then 3 hours later Johnny Walker and his wife Moffit asked if I wanted to grab dinner. You bet! So Ive had two real meals today and so much to drink-sodas, tea, naked juices, water. Unfortunately I have a top bunk bed, and there are 5 flights of steps up to the bathhouse, which will make for an interesting night. When I got here and realized that the laundry facilities were far from the bunkhouse I decided to just walk into the shower with all my dirty clothes, wash them and myself, then hang it all up to dry. It worked ok and i saved money. (Quite the lady!)Its been so nice here at the NOC, they have a store, outfitters, where I bought new shoe in-soles, and the restaurant. So today I left the Wesser Bald shelter at mile marker 131 and hiked here to mile marker 137. We are now at elevation 1732 and tomorrow we climb for 6 miles to elevation 4391, to the next shelter.

I think I mentioned yesterday that I had the top bunk and there were 5 sets of 15 steps up to get to the bathhouse. It turns out that after barely eating for several days the last thing you want to order for lunch is the Philly Cheese steak and fries daily special.   I made the haul to the bathhouse several times last night in the storm! After a breakfast of eggs, toast and yogurt (much more sensible options) I left NOC at 9:15 and made it the 6 mile climb to the first shelter by 2:30, at lunch and decided it was too early to stop so climbed another 500 feet and back down, 4 more miles to this campsite. For a while the trail narrowed and I didn't see any of the white blazes and thought maybe Id gotten off on a side trail. I have an App on my phone called Gutthooks that has GPS positioning so I used it for the first time and it showed I was still on the AT. Several of the other hikers also had doubts they were on the trail so I wasn't alone. Tonight I am with 5 hikers I've not met before, and Foghat who seems to do the same miles as I do.

After about 3 miles, I came to a gap and a gentleman pulled up and dropped off a bag of apples and big jug of water. Trail majic before my very eyes!. Then we had a difficult uphill climb called Jacobs Ladder.   Up 600 feet in 6/10 of a mile. It was so steep we had to hike on our toes.   That was the hardest part of the day. Got to a gap 1 mile before the shelter and a hiker had a friend set up more trail majic, pop and snacks. Twice in one day!A funny thing happened tonight as we sat around a fireless campfire eating dinner.

Not sure I liked it, but it was much easier to pack up this morning. Hiked about 6 miles to Fontana marina where there is a phone to call for a shuttle to the Fontana Village Resort, which we did. Staying at a night room, kinda pricey, and may very well take a zero here tomorrow as well because of a large storm that will hit us by 10 am and rain hard all day Monday. We have a good climb out of Fontana and the trail conditions in a hard rain is just taking an unnecessary chance at injury. Also, this is the last "" civilization"" prior to entering the Smokey Mountains Natl Park. The Smokey's have lots of regulations, first you have to buy a permit to hike there. The permit is $20, and you have 30 days from the date you printed the permit to hike thru. There is more-once you enter the park within that 30 day window you have 8 days to hike to approx 70 miles. There are Ridge Runners, police of the Smokeys, that will ask to see your permit and there are fines if they find you in violation of their rules. Another rule is that all hikers must stay inside a shelter unless the shelter is full. Section hikers MUST stay in a shelter, so if a thru hiker gets into a shelter, sets up for the night and is asleep, and a section hiker shows up at any hour, the last thru hiker to have reached the shelter that day must vacate his space and go set up his tent. As a slow hiker this person will most likely always be me. So many rules. 
Anyway, for tonight and probably tomorrow I am at a nice resort. I've done laundry and took a shower.   Ahhhh! Met more hikers at dinner and had good socialization time. Got to talk with my daughter who turns 32 today. Happy birthday, Heather! Life is good. Still loving the guest book.

He was slightly hard of hearing so some of his answers were not related to my questions, but still pretty cool guy.

We got set up in the shelter and a section hiker came along and said there was a group of 10 section hikers with reservations on the way, so out we went and set up our tents. Today was beautiful weather but we hear of thunderstorms on the way tomorrow around 3 pm. It would be great to make 12 miles to Derrick Knob shelter, but every shelter is above 4500 feet for a few days and I don't like being this high up in foul weather.

Then most of us are making our way into Gatlinburg for resupply. 
The picture is of Short Straw and his aunt Hiking Home. We shared a hotel room last night. Hikers become best buddies quickly on the trail, and these friendships are the best thing about hiking, in my opinion. Tonight at the shelter there are about 25 hikers, which is a lot for one site, but the bad weather created a big bubble of us from Fontana Dam shelter and resort. Plus the section hikers are here. 
Nothing funny or exciting happened today. It is welcome that there is a little bit of greenery appearing which will be nice for privacy. There are few privies and the view in the woods right now is endless. You just find a big tree and hope you finish before someone rounds the bend.

It snowed all day and the trail became a muddy, soupy mess that tried to pull off my shoes while I walked. Gained about 500 feet of elevation today. No views. Very windy. Stopped for lunch at Derrick Knob shelter and met up with Nacho, who was having a hard time of hiking and was going to zero at that shelter. The wind was so strong it blew his pack rain cover off. I remember the wind would blow my leg to the side as I tried to step forward. It was too cold to stop hiking, so i at my tortilla PB and headed off. Made it the 12 miles to Silers Bald at dinner time and found 2 spaces empty in the shelter on the top bunk, empty because the roof wasnt sealed and snow/wind was blowing in on the spaces. Too tired to pitch the tent i placed my pad and bag on the layer of snow and immediately tried to get warm. Shivered all night and woke to a wet sleeping bag. Temps overnight were under 20 degrees. Started to worry because everything was frozen solid, but more importantly i couldnt stop shivering. Hadnt eated since noon the previous day, and could not seem to function properly to take care of myself. Most hikers left by 10am hoping to make the parking lot at Clingmans Dome, but I had heard from my husband that that road and the road to Newfound Gap, which hikers use to hitch into Gatlinburg were both closed. Other hikers heard rumours that park rangers were shuttling hikers off from Clingmans, so I got all my gear ready to hike and was just about to head off when I began to get dizzy. I was still in the shelter and layed down on the bunk so as about to pass out and knew I was in trouble. If the roads were closed then I would have to hike at least 7 miles in what was now a foot of snow, and I knew I couldnt do it. I had shaken all night in the wet bag, hadnt eaten or had anything to drink for over 24 hours, and now I was beginning to become hypothermic. A few hikers stayed behind and did what they could to try and get me warm, but they left by noon. More hikers started to show up from the previous shelter and were stopping by to have lunch. One of them had a SPOT rescue GPS and used it to call for a rescue for me. Within an hour a Blackhawk Military rescue helicopter was there to airlift me off the mountain. Very scary to be dangling in a basket above trees and be hoisted up into the copter, but they started IV warm saline and put me under what seemed like warm lights. Then they opened the door again and one of the guys was dangling outside and crawling over me to get in. They took me to University of TN med center and treated me for hypothermia. I have no frostbite, and they let me go after several hours under a warming blanket. My husband was in Gatlinburg waiting for me when he got the call. It is about a 1 1/2 hour drive, but fortunately he was nearby. We came back to Gatlinburg for the night. Still not feeling great, but better. Will stay here another night and pick up my friends at either clingmans dome, though as of this morning that road is still closed, or the gap. <
Not sure if I will quit the trail or try again. Maybe I should wait to see what the Rescue bill will be. I joked (I hope) that I may have to sell my car to pay for it. The military guy gave rhe nurse a business card to give to me but she accidentally threw it away. I do believe that I was in some serious trouble as i could not hike on my state and i could not have spent another night in a wet bag. Also was happy that Hiking Home, Short Straw and PaPa Smurf arrived at shelter right before rhe helicopter.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WDEF)  – The Tennessee Army National Guard rescued a sick individual from Silers Bald Shelter, near the Tennessee state border, in the Great Smoky Mountains on the afternoon of April 7.
This is the third rescue this year for the 1-230th Assault Helicopter Battalion. The unit rescued another sick individual from the same location on March 29.
Each mission, the patients were hoisted into an HH-60 medical evacuation helicopter and flown from the shelter to the University of Tennessee hospital.
In the March rescue, the National Guard helicopter departed Joint Base McGhee-Tyson in Knoxville, Tenn., at 9:15am and the entire mission was complete within an hour. Due to weather in April, it took about an hour and a half.
Last year, the Tennessee aviators completed five rescues, an airplane crash recovery, and performed medical evacuations in South Carolina in response to hurricane relief efforts.

Cricket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559400,"Just wanted to update everyone on my situation. I stayed in a hotel in Gatlinburg last night and the previous night, after being released from the ED. I am feeling fine, toes are a little ""prickly"", but otherwise I am good. My husband would like me to take a week before deciding whether to go back and hike, and his opinion is that I should just do long sections through the summer to better avoid hazardous weather in the future. I picked up Hiking Home, Short Straw and PaPa Smurf yesterday from the road to Clingman's Dome. The road to the Dome was still closed because of ice so they had to hike the 4.5 miles to the Dome, then walk 7 miles down the road to us, but it was good for them as the trail was harder to walk than the road and the rangers agreed to take their packs for them and drop them off with us. They said they used crampons for parts of the 4.5 mile trail hike because the snow had packed down to ice in several places. On the ride to Gatlinburg we rehashed all that went on with me and the evacuation and we felt pretty strongly that had they been with me at the shelter the whole time (they arrived after the SPOT had been called) they would have made me eat and drink, then started a fire to dry my stuff and warm me, and I would still be on the trail. It is important to note that the park rangers had been called several times about my situation yet did nothing. I spoke to another thru hiker who told me his story of calling a ranger and, again, the rangers did nothing. He was hiking along and found a backpack abandoned in the middle of the trail, and 3 feet away was a cell phone. Packs are not left alone unless they are on the side of the trail and the hiker needs ""woods privacy"", so this was cause for alarm. He did not see any other hikers so he got a good description of the pack color, phone, etc, hiked an hour until he had cell reception and called the Ranger to report it. The ranger then asked the hiker to GO BACK and see if he could better identify the items owner, then report back. The hiker said he could not hike back and hour, then hike back to the cell reception spot and that the ranger should be doing this. The hiker told me that he later heard that a woman had hurt her hip and two others helped her to a shelter but does not know what became of her or her things. THEN, a trail runner did show up at the shelter where I was just helicoptered out of and my friends assumed she was there to attend to me, told her I had just left, but she didn't know anything about any hiker in distress. She then got upset that hikers had built a fire in the shelter. The shelter has a stone fireplace, by the way, but also has a sign hanging in it that hikers are not to disrupt the natural beauty of the woods by gathering wood for fires. So I guess they are OK with fires if you pack in your own wood! PaPa Smurf reminded her of the case of hypothermia and that they were keeping the fire and she reluctantly agreed. Then she was unhappy because the snow surrounding the shelter was all yellow, and hikers are to go 200 feet away to urinate. Hikers come in all wet and must change into dry clothes so as to keep warm and safe so none of us were going to walk in our dry camp clothes and shoes thru 12"" of snow to pee because then our dry clothes would get wet. And we werent going to change into frozen clothes in the middle of the night to pee away from the cabin either. My impression is that the Rangers are there for the forest and not the people in the forest. I cant say enough good things about the National Guard and the blackhawk rescue, though. They were there within an hour of the distress call. I now support the SPOT, or something similar, for all hikers.If anyone reading this has experience of needing to leave the trail and then had to decide whether to return to the hike, I would be interested in what you decided to do, why, and if you have any regrets. I have appreciated all the guest book encouragements and glad that my journal was interesting to read. I read journals from last year and know how fun it can be to keep up with different hikers and how they are doing so I'm glad I could provide some fun reading. It was so fun to do the hike and the journaling and have a difficult decision to make. Thanks again for all the encouragement and concern. Bye for now-Cricket","Silers Bald

I was hoping to do 15 miles today but I was last out of camp and didn't start until 10 am. Had trouble sleeping because of leg cramps- I had 5 sets of cramps on my inner thighs on both legs. So I slept in. The last thing to get packed up is always my tent which gets attached to the back outside of my pack.   It gets rolled up and placed in a dry sack. So this morning I had it all ready to tie onto the pack and I placed it on the ground to get the pack situated and the next thing I know the darn thing was rolling away..my site was on a slight slope and it gained momentum, crossed the path and rolled down the hill about 50 yards. I yelled at it to stop, like that would help. I retrieved it without much trouble and began the hike. Again the trail was really nice, though still all fog except for the picture here. I would recommend this section to anyone wanting to hike in the Smokies- the trail is well graded and pretty, and on a clear day will have spectacular views It will give you a cardio workout, but you wont have a heart attack. 
I stopped short of my original destination of 15 miles because of rain and was able to get a spot in the shelter. I met several people as shelters are a great social spot and many of them had heard about my heli rescue 10 days ago! The trail grapevine is amazing! It is 8:40 and I'm the only one in the shelter still awake and the light from my phone is probably annoying so I will sign off. I should be out of the Smokies tomorrow.

Cricket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561061,"Left Cosby Knob shelter mile marker 229.6 early this morning. The sun was trying to make an appearance, but I was less than 100 yards from the shelter when, you guessed it, it started to rain. So on went the rain jacket and rain skirt; on I hiked. 
There was trail magic at Davenport Gap of soda and snacks and a chair to sit in. Wonderful! And after 3.5 more miles ended up at Standing Bear Farm hostel at mile marker 240.3. For $20 hikers get a mattress on the floor, a free outside shower and a wash board and sink for laundry. They have port-a-let's, so its not deluxe accommodations but it is pretty nice anyway. And we just happened by chance to arrive on the day the owners have an annual pig roast and all the locals come with a side dish, and the hikers here got to eat for free! They had bear meat in addition to the pig, but I missed that. It was fantastic. There was even a band set up on the porch and they are still playing as I type. 
It is 8:30 and dark outside and several of us are turning in for the night and planning our next few days of hiking. The next 3 miles is straight up so a few people are slack packing--they pay to be shuttled north 10 miles and then they will carry only water and lunch and will hike downhill back to the hostel. The hostel worker here told me he saw pictures of my heli rescue because it was posted on either the internet or Facebook. He says I'm famous.   Ha ha. 
So glad to be out of the Smokies and everyone here concurs. We are tired of the weather, but the forecast is for 3 more days of rain. We were comparing toenails tonight and we all are losing at least one toenail due to the wet conditions. And we are all getting blisters, also because of the feet being wet for too long.

Left camp before 8:00 and started hiking. I kept leap-frogging with another hiker named Low Gear. I hike faster on the uphills and he hikes faster on the downhills so we finally accepted ourselves as hiking partners and started to plan our day together.   We hiked 15 miles, from mile marker 250.1 to 265.6. We ran into trail magic 2 times and had a soda and a muffin. One group, located just north of Max Patch, was a group of thru hikers from 2014. That was pretty neat. They all seem to know about the rescue, too. The picture is of Max Patch which some guy years ago cleared of trees so he could graze cattle. Guess that didn't work out too well for him cause nothing is there now but pretty views in all directions. It rained on and off all day and we could see the clouds below us. The trail changed a lot during the 15 miles and it seemed like a lot farther and I was really ready to stop about 12 miles in, but Low Gear had a plan and in the end i am glad we stuck to it.

Cricket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561513,"The sun was actually out this morning and it turned into a nice day for hiking, cool and mostly overcast, but that makes the hills easier to climb. Couldn't believe my luck because I was not about to leave a dry hotel room to hike, as there is no stopping in towns for at least 5 days. Next stop is Erwin and it is approx 70 miles away. The backpack is weighed down with food, probably 8 lbs worth. I am trying something new on the trail which is bagels and cream cheese. I read that cream cheese and some other hard cheeses can last in cooler temps outside the refrigerator for several days so i have that and some bagels. For breakfast i had a cream cheese bagel with tuna fish. Lunch was a nut bar, fruit roll up and lemon cream cookies. Dinner was mac-n-cheese and chocolate wafers. So I am eating more calories a day than the start of my hike, though still never very hungry. The trail out of Hot Springs crosses the French Broad River, then runs next to the river for a quarter mile marker before it climbs up from 1325 feet to over 3500, our highest point today. The river was swollen way over its banks and came close to spilling onto the trail in a couple of places. The trail since leaving the Smokies has been pretty with many creeks with cascading water and mossy boulders. I arrived at the first shelter from Hot Springs called Spring Mountain Shelter (hiked from mile marker 273.4 to 284.4, 11 miles) and couldn't believe my eyes--Foghat was also setting up his tent. He was with my original hiking bubble and because of my 11 days off trail thought I would never see him again.   He had been in Hot Springs for 5 days nursing a foot sprain and has also taken time getting his nutrition straightened out. Several of us are forcing ourselves to eat more than we are interested in doing just to have some energy. And it seems to be a bigger problem for us older generation as the kids are always snacking and talking of food.  It is 5:15 and I have already eaten and am ready for bed. It won't be dark for a couple of hours yet but it is already sprinkling again and it is nice to be done with chores before rain comes. When I finish this journal entry and send it off to my hubby to post then I will listen to an audio book, then music until its time to sleep. Tonight is my first night with a new inflatable pillow purchased in Hot Springs. I also had to buy new shoes and the store did not have what I had been wearing so i bought trail runners instead.

I'm exhausted and didn't arrive until 5:45 so I hiked for almost 10 hours and am now tenting at Jerry Cabin shelter site mile marker 300.4.

The winds lasted all night long and whipped the fabric ferociously and the only way to sleep was to listen to music to drown out the sound. The tent held strong, though. The day was warm and the trail was nice enough. There was one section where the trail was basically a creek bed and mudslide. I slipped and fell, gracefully into my hands and feet, but the backpack had momentum of its own and flipped me around and i landed on my backside. It took several baby wipes to get clean that night.

The next 3 days have a bleak forecast of rain, cold, and for tomorrow a high wind advisory.  My vote is to stay at the hostel but it is a very small town with not much to do and Low Gear would rather zero in Damascus, which is understandable.  One of the hikers staying here named Shaggy ( a different Shaggy from the one i met before) was telling funny stories of people he has met on trail.  He met a guy at on the approach trail that had to leave the trail at Springer Mountain because he had forgotten his water filter so he was burning fuel to melt snow, but then he ran out of fuel and couldnt cook, so he left.  He also ran into two guys who were each carrying a full size electric heavy microscopes that they said were expensive and they were sure someone on the trail would want to buy them cheap.  Like, who goes shopping for items like that on the trail.  Another hiker named Sun told of a guy she met that carried a light weight tent, but it leaked badly so he also brought a wetsuit!  Strange things are happening out here.  I have only met fairly rational thinking people so far so my stories might be dull.

We have a small cabin with twin beds, sheets, pillow, and a bath house with free laundry.  I called the campground owner to ask if anyone delivered food around here and he laughed at me, said this is a very small town, but that if we could be ready in two minutes he would drive us to a place we could get burgers, so we did that.   We are clean, dry, warm and fed. Plus we will not be sleeping in 35 degree temps with 35 mile winds tonight.  We are at mile marker 447.5.  
Tomorrow will be a long day but the terrain is good and we have made reservations at the Woodchuck Hostel for the next two nights.  I may be in Damascus for several days because we climb to over 5,000 feet again and the forecast is for cold and rain and wind.  I'm not doing that again.  Plus I got a message from Hiking Home that they had stayed at a hostel for a couple of days and they are now a day or two behind me. They are attempting to get to the Vandeventer Shelter  tonight, which is where I was last night.  To get there one must go thru the Watauga Lake area and the trails are closed to all persons except thru hikers due to high bear activity, and the shelter there is closed to even thru hikers.  Once on trail you are required to hike 4 miles without stopping to eat or camp. I heard others say they saw bears but I still have not.  
Low Gear let me know that his mom will be leaving the ICU for a regular room and will get off the ventilator.  He is still hoping to be able to rejoin the trail, possibly wherever I am, and hike again.  I will probably still be in Damascus.  Ha Ha.

We only did about 10 miles and will tackle ""the hardest 7 miles of trail in Virginia"" according to rumors.  Then we will go to a hostel and get real food and resupply.  Cant wait.  We are in the shelter tonight and the Florida guys are tenting here, too.  Met a South-bounder who started in Harper's Ferry and played cards with him.

Cricket,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567344,"No one slept well last night as the temperature dropped while we slept to 45 degrees. I have a 55 degree bag, and since we all took a Tylenol PM before bed we were cold but couldn't wake up enough to realize we needed more clothes. Short Straw was heard moaning in the night, cold and unable to waken enough to help himself.  Last time he moaned in his sleep was when the shelter we were at had a leak in the roof and he was dripped on all night long -- again, too tired to waken enough to help himself. Anyway, we stayed in the shelter, and the Florida group tented (we saw them all day long, but now they are done with their section hike for the year), and a SoBo hiker who started at Harper's Ferry and played cards with us that night,  and a father/daughter team named Colonel and U-Turn.  I met them while hiking with Low Gear, and it looks like we will be spending the next week hiking together.  
I took off by 7 am and slowly made my way up the hill (remember, it's always ""good morning, now go climb a mountain"").  We knew that in 4 miles we would get to a popular spot called Dragons Tooth and we wanted to spend time there as a group,  so I waited for the others.  The day was perfect, maybe even too hot with 82 degrees, and the trail was rocky and difficult with heavy packs on, but really beautiful. We had two sets of rebar ladders built into the rock-face to make the climb in these sections manageable, but we were only planning the 7 miles to the hostel so we took our time.  Once at the hostel at 11:30 we were told that THE place to eat didn't open until 3:00, and if we wanted we could be driven 6 miles north and slack pack back to the hostel and be back for dinner we chose to do that.  So even though we are at the hostel at mile 702.4, we really have done like 13 miles up to trail mile 708.3.  Tomorrow we will slack pack again, 20 miles, from 708.3 to 728.1.  It will be our longest day, but with bad weather forecast for Monday we will zero on that day.  
The dinner tonight was amazing- all you can eat family style with lemonade, tea, fried chicken, roast beef, ham, mashed potatoes and gravy, coleslaw, corn, beans, and biscuits.  We ate until we felt sick.  It was great.  We were dropped off at the restaurant and there was a line at the door waiting to be seated, but they took our party of seven filthy, smelly, dirty hikers right in and we we served within 5 minutes. They are very good to hikers, realizing that most of us have lost 30 pounds already and come starving to their place.  It is hard not to think about food after 6 days of granola bars and Ramen noodles, and we start to feel weakened by lack of calories.  
The hostel is crazy.  Its a 3 car garage, lined with regular garage stuff, and then filled with old tattered couches and chairs, I'm in a lazy boy recliner and they are in pool side loungers.  There are 15 of us here and one bathroom that has the only toilet, shower and sink.  We chose not to shower even though we are 6 days stinky, so that should tell you something.  But to be fair, it is a donation only hostel and they shuttle you to the restaurant and gas station.  
This is getting lengthy and our ride leaves at 7 am so I need to get in line for the bathroom so I can get to sleep.  More later.","Pickle Branch Shelter at mile 695.7

Nope.  And to be fair, the delivery guy DROVE. 
We had another beautiful day, though a bit hot, and the views were terrific.  We saw McAfee knob (see picture from yesterday, that's me), Tinker Cliffs, Hay Rock, and there were lots of day hikers on the trail, this being Sunday and all.  We were taking pictures at the Knob when a guy proposed to his girlfriend, she must have said yes, there was crying and calling the mother, all on top of the most photographed rock on the AT.  You need to share this rock to get individual photos taken and this couple and their friends were shocked when we asked them, after 20 minutes, if they could move out of the way for us.  
Anyway, the trail was amazing, but 20 miles was too much for me for one day and the last 5 miles were torture.  There is an area near Tinker Cliff where the AT takes a sharp turn.  There is a sign posted on a tree indicating the turn for the AT, but to go straight is an option if you just want to climb around the base of the rock cliff. Well, two of our party missed the sign and went straight.  We finally found them.  Another hiker also missed the turn and spent an hour going in circles trying to find his way back on trail. Short Straw helped him get back on the path, too.

Tomorrow has 2 big climbs and we've planned for only 9 miles because of the difficulty.  We are currently at 951 feet and climb to 2000 feet in one mile (yuck) just to go back down to 1200 feet, then climb again to over 3560 feet.  
I've learned the value of Tylenol PM out here.  It is hard to get to sleep, even when I'm exhausted because of the pain of hiking distances.  Both feet throb, my knees are usually on fire, and my back and shoulders ache.  This is somewhat standard pain for all of us, and the sleep aid works wonders.  I wake up around 2 am every nite now because my air mattress has a small leak in it.  I will replace it this weekend.  
We played cards last nite with a young man from Germany named Mustafa.  There are many hikers here on a 4 to 6 month visa and are hiking hard to get done in time.  They all seem to want to visit New York and Washington  DC if time allows.  I found it interesting that no one from Europe knows about poison ivy, oak and sumac.  They are having trouble identifying it and are terrified of the berry bushes that are everywhere, though no berries yet, because they are ""leaves of three"".

Sex Shop went home yesterday.  We gave him his trail name his first day on trail because when he said he worked on a socks shop Nothing Stuck (so named because when he was asked why he didn't have a trail name yet he replied, Well, so far nothing's stuck) thought he said sex shop.  That's all it took to get his name.  He had planned to be on the AT for one month but lasted two days, and two days of the easiest trail terrain so far.  Poor kid.  He tried to hike with thru hikers and they are doing more miles a day at this point than a new hiker should start off doing.

We passed a campground with a camp store and I got a soda and two hard boiled eggs.  I made tuna salad with them, mayo and relish and ate it on tortillas.  Not a very exciting day.  We did meet up with some hikers we hadn't seen for a while and got caught up on their news. And we played cards.  Short Straw has a birthday tomorrow, he turns 23, and I told him I would buy him a blackberry milkshake at the wayside we will be passing 6 miles from here.We have had nice weather today, and should have tomorrow, but then rain again.More later.","mile 907.4 at a hotel in ELKTON, VA

Great start to the day. Then we hiked on, uneventfully, to the wayside for breakfast.  While there I finally got cell reception and heard from my daughter, Lauren, who had started the first 4 days on the trail with me.  She was able to come pick me up from the trail today so we decided to plan for that instead of me leaving the trail at Harper's Ferry since it would be harder to arrange a ride from there.  My knees are done, the left one mostly.  It would have been great to get to the AT conservancy, but that didn't work out.  So we stayed the night at the lodge and left Friday morning for Front Royal because Short Straw's new backpack was mailed to the hostel there. Hiking Home and Short Straw checked in to the hostel, then we went to eat, then to resupply at WalMart, then to the post office to return mail the broken pack.  While at the post office a hiker named Guppy that I knew was there needing a ride to the grocery.  I gave him a ride and he told me that he was at the post office because he had found over $200 on the trail and through the trail grapevine found out who had lost it and he was mailing it back to him.  How awesome is the trail!  After taking Short Straw and Hiking Home back to the hostel Lauren and I stopped for a couple of hikers hitching into town.  They turned out to be a couple I met at Hiawassee who are also on TJ named Aquaman and Sapphire.  We gave them a ride and he said he had turned both ankles on the last part of the Shenandoahs because it is rocky.  Hopefully they can continue.Anyway, I am home now and pretty sure I won't get back on trail.  It is hard on the body, but I am glad I gave it my best shot.  Thanks to all who have been enjoying this journal and to those who signed my guest book and encouraged me during my hike.  It was appreciated very much!","Bearfence Shelter mile 916.4

There was a large group of over 50 women hikers headed southbound, all so nice, and we passed each other in waves.  There were also many eclipse day hikers out on the Parkway as well, and one couple let me use their special glasses for a moment so I could see it clearly and not go blind.  I just happened to come across a side trail leading to a parking viewpoint at exactly eclipse time.  I could not have timed it better had I known when the eclipse would begin!

This year he is only doing Maryland as a south-bounder.  Gathland park was 10 miles from Harper's Ferry, but it was 12:30 when I got there so I decided to make it 6 more miles to Rocky Run shelter.  The last 3 miles were tough and I would have loved it if there had been water and a place to stay at mile 13, but it the conservancy has yet to cater to my needs.  I think that's a different vacation.At the shelter are several people, all trying a thru hike and all from West Virginia, though spread out from Huntington, Beckley area and so near Morgantown. They all started from HF yesterday and are impressed at my mileage, but not so impressed at my sad, shuffling gait.  They are walking like normal people.   This is a very nice shelter with lots of space. I am on the bottom level but the ladies on the top level are not hanging their food and are sleeping with it instead.  This does not make me happy at all.  I joked that the bears will look at us on the lower level first but they have the impression that a bear will not come this near to so many people Which i don't believe.  That crazy part is there is a bear pole 30 feet away.  No need to throw a bear line at all!

The hostel owner stated they got 3 inches of rain Sunday. Anyway, the hostel was good, but pricey. And the shuttle to the Trailhead cost another $63.  Lauren paid by vendor, Tim, so we owe her some money.Anyway, we were shuttled to the trailhead, PA 183.  We hiked just the 6 miles to the first shelter, Eagles Nest. It is 7:30 as I type this message and there are at least a dozen others here, though we were first to arrive. Most everyone else did 15 miles and came from the 501 shelter.
It was chilly all day, in the 50s, and we had many short bursts of rain and 2 bursts of small hail.  I will enclose a video.  The hiking was flat but full of rocks --those pointy and small -- and I ended up with a blister on the side of my heal because my foot kept shifting around in the shoe.  This happens to me whenever the trail has long stretches of this type terrain. 
Arlo had a good time, and after eating lunch at the shelter we thought about hiking another 2 to 4 miles, but Arlo started to limp slightly (i think that dog understands English) so we just stayed put.  
Lauren is freezing for some reason.  She shouldn't be this cold. I've given her my puffy jacket to layer up with.  Neither of could sleep last night so now she took a Benadryl and hasn't moved for a while, so probably is our for the night.  
Gathered water prior to dinner only to find out that the brand new water filter that Amazon sent me, that took a month to arrive, doesn't work!. Of course Lauren let me use hers, bit still. Hers is small and I want a larger, faster one.  Six miles further up Trail we can maybe get a ride to the ""world largest"" Cabela's store and I can get a new one.  It is supposed to be just as cold tomorrow and rainy -- real steady rain, not just bursts like we had today.  I had told Lauren to put her rain pants on to sleep in because they are very insulating only for her to tell me she didn't pack rain pants.  Tomorrow might be hard on her.  There is a hotel nearest Cabela's which we may need to stay at if she gets soaked. So far an expensive trip. 
Lauren and Arlo both sound asleep and it is just getting dark.  All conversation from the direction of the shelter has stopped and everyone is in tents.  That is all I can think of to tell you about day 1.  Good night.

It made her so snuggly and warm that my gentle suggestions for her to get up went nowhere.  So she had my puffy and the quilt, so me sitting at the picnic table in the cold morning was not too fun, but my oatmeal kept me warm.  
We were the last to leave the shelter (and the first to arrive), and did get off by 8:30. I miscalculated the mileage so it was 9 miles instead of 6.  The weather was same as yesterday, cold, windy with several periods of small hail.  I prefer the hail to rain because the hail just bounces off is but the rain requires rain pants and eventually everything wets through. The last half mile was almost straight down and some of the hardest down I have had yet. Big deep stone steps that were not flat, with leaves and loose dirt that were wet and slippery.  I turned my ankle but was able to walk on it, though it is still sore.  Blister count is now Lauren 1, Kathy 2.  
God sent us a gift of a trail angel.  She was climbing  up that horrible mess we were going down and we got to chatting. She wanted to know our plans, so we mentioned the need to get to Cabela's.  Lauren wanted another blanket and I needed a water filter, and she said if we were around when she got back down that she would drive us.  So she did!  So grateful for that because Cabela's has a free shuttle service between the church Pavilion we planned to spend the night at and their store , though they were in opposite directions, but we were too late  for the last pick up.  So the trail angel driving us to the store and catching the 5 o'clock Cabela shuttle to the pavilion worked out perfectly.  We knew our trail angel all of 3 minutes and she wanted to give us both a hug.  People can be so kind. 
We are here in a tent that is set up inside this large picnic shelter.  I wanted the tent set up cause It blocks a lot of the cold wind.  Lauren is still cold.  It is 7:43 pm and 47 degrees now, with lowabout 38, but high humidity makes it fells that much colder.  It's getting dark.  We met a hiker woman from Germany and a young man from Hilton Head Island.  His trail name is Father David To Be.  Very nice man who tried to get to a Mass service in Hamburg tonight and the service was canceled.

The food was delicious but the best thing about the place was that it was heated!  Lauren left Arlo in our tent while we walked the half mile road walk to the restaurant, and she left the tent unzipped because if he really wanted out he would just rip the tent.  A fellow hiker left the restaurant before us and he said Arlo was walking around the shelter. He sat with him until we returned.  People are nice.  Anyway, we got on trail about 10:30 and only hikes 6 miles, but it took us until 3:00, which is a dismal pace, but we are sore and I just felt my muscles have no energy.  Plus it was a climb for four of those miles.  
We got to the shelter with two of the guys we've been running into and Lauren and one of them started a fire. That doesn't seem so impressive except for the fact that we have had rain every day and all the wood is soaked. The guy packed in drier lint, I had Vaseline, and Lauren found some pieces of dried wood, and with lots of effort we were all enjoying the fruits of their labor.  
Lauren keeps telling people that she will be on trail another night, and I am begging her to stay with me until New Jersey. Maybe if it warms up a little she will want to continue.  This wet cold stuff, on top of the fact that Pennsylvania is incredibly rocky, is swaying her to stop sooner.

Last night one of three guys at camp that we have run into a few times told us why his trail name is Paw.  He has a tattoo of a dog's paw on his chest, visible if his shirt has a v neck.  But the tattoo is special because he has a silicone implant under the tattoo to make it 3 dimensional, so the paw pads are actually bumpy.

Several Boulder fields, shifting rocks, and in between that mess were those little pointy rocks with no foot space between them.  
When we got to the shelter at about 2:30 for lunch I wanted to spend the night.  It was 4 more miles and I could not imagine 4 more of the miles we had just done.  But, there was a guy camping at the shelter, not a hiker, older guy, who said he pulled a wagon with supplies from the road.  It took him 12 hours.  Well, Lauren and I looked at each other with the same thought-the trail was ""wagonable"". I almost cried with joy.  We forced ourselves onward for the next 4 miles, which weren't that bad, but Lauren's feet and my, well everything, were hurting so much that it was all we could do to make it to the hostel.  No one else was here, so we showered (I thought it ironic that the hostel owner tiled the shower floor with rocks, like we just cannot get away from  the PA rocks!) and put some laundry in, then went up the road for dinner.  I can barely move.  I'm not kidding.  Lauren wants to slack pack me 5 miles tomorrow while she and Arlo take a day off.  That will work if I can move.  
On the lighter side, the day was warmer and sunny with just a small breakthrough sprinkle.
