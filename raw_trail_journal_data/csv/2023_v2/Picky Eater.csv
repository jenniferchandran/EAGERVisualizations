Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/658790,"My wife (aka Grinch) and I decided in 2019 to sell our hobby farm in Northern Michigan, purchase a Class A motorhome and become full time RVers. While this seems kind of extreme, we did something similar back in our 20s and built an off grid cabin in Alaska. 
Alaska was awesome, we raised our family there, but when it was time for a change we moved to Michigan and bought the Farm. Michigan is also awesome, we finished raising our family there. 
Now it's time for another adventure. So the RV is going into storage for 6 months and we'll be heading up to Springer Mountain in Georgia to start the Appalachian Trail where we hope to make it all the way (2194 +/- miles) to Mt. Katahdin in Maine.
After backpacking several distance trails the last 2 years, I do believe we're confident enough to attempt a thru hike of the Appalachian Trail in 2023. We have all of our gear dialed in and with a few changes we'll be ready to start in mid February. 
Some of the trails we've hiked:
150 miles of the Pinhoti trail in Alabama over 3 weeks.84 miles of the Florida Trail thru the Ocala National Forest.80 mile loop of the Pigeon River Forest in Northern Michigan",,View Entry,"Oct 14, Fri",0

Our Gear
After researching and trying out different gear over the last 2 years, we chose the following for our big three for the AT.
Backpack - REI Flash 55
What drew me to this pack to begin with was the side pockets leaned forward enough that I could easily reach my water bottle behind me when I had the pack on. No need to have a bottle dangling in front on my chest straps. Got fitted at REI for the right size, used it on the 150 mile Pinhoti hike and loved it. Grinch has since bought the same pack in woman's size. Not ultra light but pretty light at 40 ounces.
Tent - Zpacks Duplex
Purchased our Duplex prior to hiking the Florida trail shakedown. So far we love it. It feels big enough for the two of us but we haven't spent 6 months in it yet either. The jury is still out on whether we should have bought the Triplex. We overnighted in some rain with no problems but admittedly it wasn't a downpour. Easy to set up fast and it only weighs 18.5 oz!
Sleep system - Zenbivy 10deg Light Bed Quilt and Sheet set - Therma Rest NeoAir Xlite sleeping pad
We haven't used either one of these on the trail yet but I did set it up in the RV. The Zenbivy has a sheet that straps to your pad and the quilt clips to it. It wasn't cheap (about $650 each for the sleep system) but confident we'll be warm at the early part of the trail. The Zenbivy weights 44 oz and the Therma Rest is 13 oz.
With all of our gear packed except food and water, my pack weight is about 17 lbs and Grinch's will be just slightly more. With water and 3 days food we're probably looking at 25 lbs.",,View Entry,"Oct 19, Wed",0

Grinch and I did a 10.4 Mile hike on the Eastern Lake Trail in the Florida Panhandle.  Perfect day, cool mornings and 70's in the afternoon. I know it's not the Appalachian Mountains, in fact, it's pretty darn flat. It'll have to do, as this is as hilly as it gets around here. 
In the next couple weeks we'll start putting our full backpacks on so we can get some time in carrying 17lbs + food/water. <img src=""/images/photos/journals/27394/tj27394_110422_163143_1307884.jpg"" class=""img-responsive"">",,View Entry,"Oct 27, Thu",0
Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659300,"We overnighted on the Florida Eastern Lake trail for a couple nights. The trail itself isn't very challenging, but it is pretty and gave us a chance to carry our full backpacks. We also carried 2 days worth of water. Packs weighed in about 22 lbs.
Our Zenbivy quilt system is the most comfortable I've slept while backpacking. They're exactly what we need to start the AT in February, but it was a little warm for a 63 degree Florida night.",,View Entry,"Nov 04, Fri",0
Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659407,"Set a goal to lose my pack weight in weight loss before starting the trail which would be about 19 lbs before food and water. I'm at -11lbs so it looks like I'll reach it.
I'm a little concerned about eating so healthy and then going to high sodium and high carb foods once we start the trail. The goal is to meet somewhere in the middle and also load up on fresh salads and fruits when we get to town every few days.
When we hiked the Pinhoti trail in Alabama I picked up oranges in town and carried them with me so I could have one with lunch every day. The weather will be cold enough for the first couple months of the AT that we can do the same. 
We heard from Stumpknocker, who we met on the Pinhoti, that our starting in February will allow us to have awesome views from the trail before the leaves set in. Although it will be cold for a couple months he added. Stumpknocker has hiked the entire AT something like 4 times and has been an inspiration for both Grinch and I. He also has journals on this same platform. 
We're currently work camping at an Rv park in Florida until we head out for the trail in mid February.  We are walking at least 3 miles a day and then adding another 4 miles in the evening 4 nights a week. That hopefully will lessen the shock of 10 mile days of the start of the AT?
Haven't worked out the logistics of storing the RV, Car and motorcycles for the 6 months on the trail but confident we'll figure it out by then.",,View Entry,"Nov 16, Wed",0

Been noticing 2023 AT thru hikers posting videos online already. We won't be posting any youtube videos but it is exciting to see some of the folks we could be coming across on the trail. 
We're going to try to sneak in another shakedown hike in the next couple months but mostly going to keep walking every night to keep in shape.

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659646,"It's crazy to think that we've been planning this adventure for more than 2 years. It started out with us backpacking the High Country Pathway in the Pigeon River Forest in Northern Michigan.  Our packs were from WalMart, everything we carried was heavy. Our tents were decent, but in the 4 lb range. We weren't in shape, we had no clue, but we had a blast. We were hooked. 
The Appalachian Trail was not on our radar back then. The goal was to complete the 80 mile High County Pathway by section hiking over the summer.  Did it, and it was awesome.  Came across elk, black bear, coyote, swamps, lakes, views  and cold nights. We loved it and wanted to do more. I would love to do the High Country pathway again as a thru hike. There are so many more cool hiking areas  in Michigan on the bucket list.  God willing, we'll be able to backpack the North Country trail across the UP in the next year or so.
We're full time RVrs so we've spent the last few winters in Florida work camping. Last winter was at Alexander Springs in the Ocala National Forest so we were able to hike 80 miles of the Florida Trail thru the forest. It's beautiful! And cool. 
The winter before, we were able to head up to Alabama and backpack 150 miles of the Pinhoti trail. Tornadoes came thru twice while we were on the trail and we had to get off and shelter but otherwise it was a great learning experience on hiking in the mountains.  We certainly got a good idea of what gear we would need on the Appalachian trail. 
We are now under 60 days before our long planned AT start date. Have all our gear and clothing and are now focusing on important things like making sure our lighters are new and full and is there enough Alieve in the kit. 
The hike is 100 percent on our minds every day. So looking forward to being on the trail every day. No Politics,  No Recession, No Election. No working.  AHHHH. 
We know every day will be a challenge and we are ready for it. 
Grinch and I talk about the trail every day. We've researched gear, food, weather,  everything trail related together.  We are ready to take on this challenge. Can we start already?We checked out the Florida Trail terminus a couple weeks ago. That's on the bucket list too!",,View Entry,"Dec 30, Fri",0

We went on an overnight motorcycle ride last week and did some tent camping. Guess that qualifies as a shakedown?

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660222,"Made it to Amicalola Falls State Park. In the morning we'll hitch a ride at 6am to the main trail and start our hike from Springer Mountain. Got our official picture taken under the Arch. We are hikers numbered 407 and 408 out of 3000 or so expected this year.
Staying in the hiker shelter near the visitor center tonight. It's like 75 degrees and we're hoping it cools down a little. A bit warm for a 10 degree down quilt.
Sharing the shelter with ""Rambling Man"". He's hiked the AT 3 times before and is on a solo section hike. As his trail name suggests, there are lots of stories to tell. He did set up a mouse trap about 3 ft from my head on the bunk, so we've got that going.
Our trip from Florida was uneventful.  The car is now stored for 6 months or so with the battery unhooked. Hopefully be there in one piece when we finish the trail. A shout out to all our friends from work for the nice send off and for helping get our rv and motorcycles over to storage. It's a good feeling knowing someone has your back.
The plan is to hike 3 days to Neels Gap and probably get into a hiker hostel for a night and resupply with another 3 days food. I saw a mountain forecast for Monday night calling for 50 mph winds with rain and under 20 degrees wind chill. If that hold up, we'll stay off for another night.

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660257,"The ride up to Springer Mountain this morning was interesting.  Straight up gravel and 2 track road. Passed some Army rangers in training with full gear. They weren't smiling.
It was a mile hike uphill to the summit.  We took our pictures and signed the logbook at 7:45 am. Clouds had moved in and although we couldn't see the mountains all around us, I have to say it was pretty cool. Like we had Springer Mountain to ourselves. The 2200 mile trip begins from here. Today we hiked from Springer Mtn to Hawk Mountain campsite 7.4 miles down the trail. We hiked about 9 miles total today when you add in side trails. 
Met section hikers Jakobe and Quiet at Springer Mountain shelter. Chatted for a bit and they gave us a heads up about a water supply down the trail.
Met Lilly, a trail runner for the AT in the Springer Mountain parking area. She said she spends the whole summer hiking and camping the Georgia section keeping an eye on things, helping hikers and teaching leave no trace.
Today was a reminder of how tough sections of the trail can be. Lots of upsides and downs, rocks and mud. We expect tomorrow To be a little harder.
Picky Eater was the first to take a tumble on the trail. I never new tripping on a root and flipping over landing on my backpack could look so ungraceful. Probably be nursing a sore foot for a few days.
Made it to camp as it started raining. We got some experience setup our trekking pole tent in the rain and mud. Heated up some food, ate in the tent and are now relaxing and tending to sore spots.
Over all, a good day!

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660264,"It rained pretty hard last night. We slept great and didn't get up till 7am. I think we did a good job picking out our sleep system. Should have bought a little larger tent but this Zpacks Duplex will have to do. 
Expected today to be a bit more difficult and it was. Still an amazing day. Sassafras Mountain about halfway thru the day was the most challenging climb yet but we had nice weather and took our time. The clouds broke so it's pretty much beautiful mountain views all around. Heading down the mountains is much more difficult than going up. It's been a little harder on the feet and legs and takes a lot of concentration to not trip. The trails have been maintained excellent. Water is plentiful all along the trail. There's a stream or water flow every so often. We just fill up our bag and filter into our smart water bottles. It's the best water. I will miss it when we have to go to civilization. 
Still not as many hikers as I expected to see so the trail is still fairly quiet. That'll probably change in a week. Hopefully we'll be a couple weeks ahead of the big hiker bubble by then.
Got to Gooch Mountain shelter about 5:30 in light rain. Found a flat tent site and finished setting up just as it started raining hard. Ate our dinner in the shelter with 4 other hikers. One was from Frankfort Germany and one from Texas. Hopefully find out a little more about all of them in the morning.
It's been rainy on and off all evening and more rain tomorrow.  I heard a saying in an AT hiking video: ""No rain, no pain, no Maine"" which sums things up pretty well. 
Grinch had her first fall today compliments of a tree root. I didn't see it happen but to hear her storytelling, it was worthy of an academy award. She survived without any injuries so all is good","Hawk Mountain Campsite

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660279,"Another good night's sleep. We had a determined mouse chew a 2 inch hole in our tent screen and also chewed into Grinch's hanging bag that had a snack wrapper in it. There are no mosquitoes yet so I can put off that repair for a bit.
Short day today. Got picked up at 10:30 at Gooch Mtn parking area by ""Disco"" for a ride to Above the Clouds Hostel. We heard such great things about this place so we decided to check it out and dry out some of our gear tonight. $50 each for the night includes a bunk, shuttle ride, hot shower, breakfast and they do your laundry. I might just move in. They also have this cool electronic foot and leg massage chair. I'm sitting in it writing this now.
Heavy rain last night and we had some water splash in the tent while we were having dinner in the shelter. Not too bad but some of our Xtra clothes got wet. 
I'm told a lot of people get picked up here because they decided hiking the AT isn't for them. Usually it's because their packs are too heavy and that causes all kinds of problems. I've come across people with packs over 50 lbs. We are in the 25 to 28 lb range and I'd like to drop 2 or 3 lbs. But our packs feel good and we feel good.
Big Day tomorrow. 11 miles to Slaughter Creek.

Fresh coffee and all 15 hikers organizing their packs and getting ready for the morning. ""Where are you getting dropped?"", ""How far you going today?"", ""Are you staying at the next hostel?"" It was quite the gathering.
Got dropped off at Gooch Gap for an 11.3 mile hike to Slaughter creek campsite. We both feel great today so this will be our longest day yet.
Trail magic at Woodys Gap from Rainman. Grinch had a hotdog. Too early in the day for Picky Eater  so settled for a pickle spear. We also received trail magic from a young couple. ( Didn't get their names dang it) they had boxes of candy bars and cases of pop. He had hiked the trail in 2019 and wanted to help hikers like he was helped.
Took a snack break at preachers Rock, a 5 mile climb up about 5 miles in. Pretty much fogged in for a view when we first got there but then opened up to a beautiful panoramic view. Today's cover picture is taken from there.
Met Eli - we saw him a couple days earlier taking a bath in a waterfall. We reminded him of it today. Picky Eater said that cold water was like one of those fundraisers in the winter. Grinch said ""Polar Plunge!""….and that's how a trail name is born. I think Eli is now gonna go by Polar Plunge. He seemed to like it.
Today was a lot of up and down Mountain climbs. Fog in the early day and some sun and mountain views later. We arrived at Slaughter Campsite about 5:00, set up and ate some Mountain house breakfast and some mashed potato. Delicious. Grinch has a movie going she downloaded. Should we be this comfortable?
Still deciding tomorrow's plan. We have a 3 mile trek up and over Blood Mountain to Mountain crossings store/outfitter and hostel. We may stay there depending on weather. There's other options down the trail too. It's looking like scattered thunder showers the next week so one way or another we'll be hiking in the rain.

Came across Alaska on the trail. He got that name by his ability to withstand very cold temperatures. 
Hiked for a bit with Trent from Ohio. He's an Eagle Scout. We took a picture of him at the summit  for his mom and he took our photo.
Going down a pretty steep section, we passed Mayor. He is finishing up his Southbound hike. Been hiking all winter and has 30 miles to go. He was loving every minute of being so close to the finish. Mayor gave us some candy bars as trail magic.
Got to Mountain Crossings Store/Outfitter and hostel just before noon. It started raining just as we arrived and is supposed to rain till morning so we asked if they had any beds available in the Hostel. We paid for 2 beds and got to the hostel which only had one bed left. So one of us is sleeping on the floor tonight. Guess who.

Redwood, who used to play college basketball and is about 7 foot tall, told us how his dad took him mountain climbing up Mt. McKinley when he was a kid and how they had to dig a shelter because it was too much of a blizzard to set up camp. They stayed in the hole for 3 days before the weather cleared and they were able to summit.
Most everyone at the hostel had planned to hike 11 miles to Low Gap Shelter today. We also heard from other hikers that they planned to do the same. It's looking to be a busy place.
Passed Long Story today. We stopped and chatted for a bit. He is finishing his Southbound thru hike. Only 40 miles to go. He looked tired, but it was late in the day. He said last night where he set up camp got real windy and a few times his tent almost collapsed on him.
Passed a volunteer ridge runner a few miles before getting to camp. She asked where we were going and we told her Low Gap Shelter. She said there was plenty of room there and asked if we were good on water. It's great they have those volunteers hiking the mountain trails making sure no one gets in trouble.
Passed a group of Japanese tourists with LLBean type clothing ready to conquer one of the mountain views. Seems like we come across a lot more day hikers when there is a view with a parking lot nearby.
We both started getting tired about 8 miles into our 11 mile day. A lot of upsides and downs. Hoping that there would be room for our tent near the shelter so we didn't have to go farther looking for a spot. Plus the shelter is usually near a water source, has a privy and a picnic table. 
Arrived at Low Gap Shelter about 5:30 so we had been hiking for 9 hours. There were probably 7 tents set up with another 7 sleeping bags lined up in the shelter claiming spots. About 15 hikers hanging out, most of whom we've come across before. We hurried and set up our tent in one of the few remaining areas that were flat right next to the creek. It's not supposed to rain tonight so we should be good.
We headed up to the shelter and a spot at the picnic table was cleared for us to cook our dinners. We boiled water. Picky Eater had freeze dried biscuits and gravy. Grinch had Ramen Noodles. Hung out and chatted for a while.
In the tent by 7:00. Grinch has a movie playing on her phone. We  have cell service on and off  which is a treat. We have about a 9 mile day tomorrow and are getting picked up for a stay at Hostel Around the Bend for a couple nights. 
We are sticking with the plan of taking it easy for the 1st few weeks before we get to the Smokey Mountains at about 170 miles into the trail. It'll get damp and cold a lot in that stretch,  and then we should see less high climbs for a while.
We've been coming across a lot of the same hikers on the trail. It's fun to take a few minutes to exchange stories and share information about upcoming parts of the trail.

Our tent was on a flat spot next to the creek so we listened to the running water all night. We both slept really well. It's been unseasonably warm here. It stayed close to 50 degrees last night. We'll eventually hit some cold nights but we are prepared. 
Packed up our tent and gear, filtered water for the day and headed up to the shelter to make some coffee. Everyone was up and packing gear for the day. 
Chatted with ""6-2"" who was section hiking the trail with his dog. He had previously hiked the trail in 2003 back before all the ultra light gear came out. He was hiking old school before old school was cool.
Also met Sierra who was hiking with her dog. She said hiking with her dog was more about making sure piper stayed happy and had her daily nap than Sierra having her AT dream hike.
The research and preparation  for the 4 legged hikers is just as arduous and expensive as it is for the two legged hikers.   The nutrition needs of the dog come first.   And…..even they send gear home along the way!
Got on the trail about 8am on a sunny calm morning. Played leap frog with about 5 other hikers that seem to be a part of our own little hiker bubble. The first 6 miles were a gentle but steady climb most of the day. A really enjoyable hike. Then came Blue Mountain, a steep rocky incline and then a steep rocky decent where you really had to concentrate on every step. 
We called for our ride with about 2 ½ miles to go before Unicoi Gap and finished the steep decline. 
Maps and frozen belt were going to the same place so we packed our backpacks into the shuttle and headed to Hostel Around the Bend.
We planned to stay in the hostel for 1 night but extended to 2 nights to ride out a band of thunderstorms moving thru the area. 1st night in a cabin then moving into the hikers bunkhouse. This hostel is pretty nice and well planned out for hikers. Foot massagers, shoe dryers, food resupply, outfitter, even an inversion table. 
We were able to get a shuttle with a van full our bubble! hikers to Hiawassi,  GA and have dinner at a Mexican restaurant.  The ride in was a riot listening to the other hikers trying to get one of the male hikers to take the trail name ""Baby Girl"". The name had something to do with an incident at the fire at the last shelter they were at. He just might take it.

A week in review.
JOY
Two years of planning.   I won’t go into all the details as it’s well documented everywhere you research.
 We are finally on the trail.  And in between the stumbles, falls, soggy, mud-laden clothes and shoes, sore muscles and smelly clothes…….Joy.
The views are everything we imagined and more.  There are moments, in the silence of the morning at the top of a fog laden Vista your breath actually catches in your throat as reality settles in.  I am on the trail.  The next steps you take are noticeably lighter.
The cast of characters along the trail are as varied as any great novel centered around a hilariously dysfunctional family.  And just like that whole six degrees of separation from Kevin  Bacon; someone you are talking to will either know or know someone else who hiked with someone you hiked with.  It's a long-outstretched funky family tree across inter continental hiking trails.
You see the sincerity and generosity of one hiker  buying himself 3 different  large portions  of take out food so the people who couldn’t afford the luxury of town food could have a bit of that good stuff we all crave after a diet of protein bars, freeze dried meals and ramen noodles.  Joy.
Each day brings a range of new experiences and challenges and promises  more and more characters to add to the play.  
The sleep that comes is restful, peaceful and heavy.
Tomorrow I’m going to get up and go for a walk in the mountains. 
Joy.","Hostel Around the Bend

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660411,"Had coffee and breakfast with everyone at Hostel Around the Bend before getting a shuttle to Unicoi Gap. It started raining a little as soon as we started on the trail. Today's hike to Tray Mountain Shelter was 5.7 miles and more than half of that was straight up the mountains. About halfway up the wind and rain picked up, with 20 to 30mph gusts. 
We decided to sleep in the shelter because weather for the mountain was calling for rain showers,  lightning and gusts of 50 mph. For once the forecast was correct. 
As soon as we got to the shelter we hung our tent across the front and secured it tightly to block some of the wind and rain.  It worked perfect. Another hiker (Sierra) and her dgg Piper showed up before the rain got too bad. A little while later Barepaw showed up. Everyone was happy we were all out of the rain and wind. We all ate our various hiker foods and had a great chat. Barepaw had completed an AT thru hike 2 years ago. 
Everything died down about 6:30. Everyone set up their sleep systems and we hunkered down to a beautiful red sky sunset. Supposed to stay a little windy tonight with temperature about 40. 
The shelters on the Appalachian Trail are all 3 sided wood structures with a roof and a floor that usually sleeps 7 to 14 hikers. Some are 2 story. We have been tenting near the shelters but haven't been sleeping in them, mainly because they are known to have mice that get into everything. Someone told us to leave all the zipper pockets open on our gear because the mice were going to get in anyway. This way they didn't chew their way in.
The shelters so far have had a cable system between 2 trees to hook your food bag onto and hoist out of bear reach. We make sure to use them and we clean any food/snack wrappers out of our pockets and hang our trash.

On the other side of the mountain was a half mile side trail to Deep Gap Shelter.
One other hiker was already at the shelter, (Hopper) whom we've came across quite often on the trail. Several more hikers came after we were already hunkered down in the tent.
We had a quick dinner at the picnic table and got into our quilts by 5:30. The temperature was dropping fast and is getting down to the upper 30s tonight.
Sunny weather forecast for the next 4 days but still heavy winds. Should be good hiking.","Tray Mountain Shelter

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660450,"Temperature got down to 34 last night. We both stayed toasty warm. It was nice being back in our tent. We have it set up so everything is easy to reach. Just like being at home. Deep Gap Shelter was pretty nice, a double decker with views of the mornings sunrise. Took a picture of the sunrise from our tent (that's the cover photo). We had our coffee with several other hikers before heading out about 8am.
An easy 3 ½ mile hike down to Dicks Creek Gap where the Decerning Hiker was set up with some trail magic. We both had coffee and waited for our shuttle to Hostel Around The Bend where we did laundry, took a shower picked up our resupply box and added a few more items. Grinch had a large burrito and Picky Eater had a frozen pizza.  Shuttle back to the trail about 2:15. That's the last of the showers and real bathrooms for 5 days till we get to Franklin, NC. 
We hiked another 4 ½ miles or so to Plumborchard Shelter and arrived about a half hour before dark. Set up the tent, filtered water and sat down to eat again. We're pretty fast and have our system down. Chatted with a few hikers at the shelter we haven't seen before. There's also a volunteer ridge runner tenting it close to us.  
Tomorrow we cross over into North Carolina about 5 miles up the trail. It's exciting to know that we'll have one state completed. Only 13 more to go. Looks like sunny weather for the next few days.","Deep Gap shelter

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660470,"Woke up at 7:30 this morning.  We were one of the last to get to the shelter area yesterday so we didn't get the best site. Sloped down, which meant we slowly slipped
down the tent all night and had to keep creeping back up in our sleeping pads.
 Chatted with (Collassas), a young, big guy with a million dollar smile and an even bigger personality.  He should be in the movies.  
The volunteer ridge runner showed us his food trick (a full sub from the grocery store he packed out for tomorrow's lunch)  he put all the veggies in a ziplock bag to add to the sub later.  He held it up, gave it a good shake and remarked what a great salad it would  make too.  Now that's a seasoned hiker if ever there was one!
Everyone headed out one by one.
We planned on 7.1 miles for the day so we took our time having coffee/breakfast and ended up being the last ones out. It's supposed to be 66 degrees this morning. Probably a little too warm for the steep climbs ahead.
Was thinking today, what inspires people to take on an adventure like hiking the entire Appalachian Trail? Most of the people are just average everyday folks with a family at home they call or text when cell service allows. Take away all the ulralight fancy and expensive gear and everyone is just hoping they can make it thru the next days mountain passes without twisting an ankle on the downhill. I'm sure everyone out here has a story and as we get down the trail we'll hear more of them.
Crossed the GA/NC border about 1:30 at mile marker 78.1 of the trail. There was a water source nearby so we stopped to have lunch. Meat snack sausages and Swedish fish, it doesn't get any better. About this time everyday we start thinking about dinner. For this 5 day section of the trail we each brought a little over 1lb of food per day. So one good thing is our packs get that much lighter each day. 
The last 3 miles were straight up and down 3 mountains. By the time we arrived at Muskrat Creek shelter we were pooped. Only 2 other hikers here. In the tent by 7pm. We're going to try and get a little earlier start tomorrow and make it a 9 mile day. Doesn't look like as many mountains to climb.

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660496,"A little earlier start on trail this morning.  The next shelters were 5 miles and 12 miles ahead. We opted to do 9.1 miles instead to Beech Gap campsite. When we finished coffee we noticed that (The Professor) had left one of his food bags behind. He left early and was going to be hiking a lot faster and farther than us. We packed his food hoping we would see him along the way. Highly unlikely. 
Although there were a couple steep mountain climbs, it wasn't too difficult of a day and the views were amazing.
We got to camp about 4:30 and (Alabama Chowder) was there getting ready to set up his tent. We met him along the trail a couple days earlier and he stuck out because he was carrying an ultra light camping chair. Now that's a luxury item. He said he was short one days food to make it to the next resupply so we tossed him The Professor's food bag and t
Said take what you need. He took a couple things and headed off to finish setting up. He was happy for the food and Picky Eater was happy to get rid of some weight.
There was no bear proof storage container here so we hung our food bags from a tree. The comments on our map app said there was high bear activity in this area last fall. It's probably a little to early in the year for problem bears that got accustomed to taking hikers food. Probably.

It has a way of doing that. A little cooler this morning but already warming up and mostly sunny by the time we got onto the trail
After a smaller climb this morning,  most of the trail was ridgewalk with beautiful panoramic views. It was nice not to have the ups and downs as much for a change.  Didn't  get passed 5 times by the group of Eagle Scouts today either.  Kinda like that one movie……
We planned on camping at Betty Creek Gap but got there so early we decided to go a bit further to Mooney  Gap so after a half hour of snacking and stretching we moved along.(7.8 miles for the day). 
We came across Collassas and chatted a bit.  We asked him what his family (they live in Egypt) thought  of him doing an Appalachain Trail thru hike.  He responded; ""I haven't told them yet"".

We spent the night in a sheltered valley at a stealth site close to the trail.  It was a peaceful night.  We slept great, we have every night on trail. 
We were passed by various  familiar faces as we had coffee on our log.  All headed the same way, Maine via Albert Mountain and the 100 mile marker.  The daily special  on the AT menu.The approach trail to Albert was a prehistoric  feeling cliff climb.  Panoramic views were all around and one mis- step could get you a long bumpy view of the valley below.  No thanks.
We were happy to have fresh legs.  Once on the way up Albert, we were even happier.  We encountered only one other hiker pair that morning after we had already hit the summit.  We had the whole mountain  to ourselves to climb and rest at will.  At times it was a feet and hands climb.  We really enjoyed it!Strangely enough, that steep, demanding climb up Albert was followed by a long  sweetly meandering down climb.  The payoff at the bottom  is always water and there we met “Just Jack” and  “Fix it”.   There’s no better place to converse than a watering hole.  When Fix it came in a bit after meeting Just Jack, we both thought  he might be struggling a bit.  Both were seasoned and mature  individuals  like ourselves. 
Introductions led to conversations and we find out Fix It is doing the AT to Achieve his triple crown.  The Triple Crown of hiking entails completing thru hikes of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), The Continental Divide Trail (CDT), and the Appalachain  Trail  (AT).
A thru hike is a hike of a trail completed in one calendar year and there are a lot of different opinions  on what this actually  means…..but for hikers like us……..these crazy people  are just a wealth of knowledge.   They’re humble, helpful  and so ready to help anyone. 
We shared a shuttle ride to town  with the duo.  It was then that Fix It shared he wouldn’t have gone for the 3C but his wife told him he could go ahead and go.No sign of the Eagle Scouts today.

Franklin is a town that caters to Appalachian Trail thru hikers.  The Outdoor 76 outfitters store has a section in the back to get a craft beer (or 2). There's a local brewery within walking distance. The local church has a free breakfast daily for hikers. The town runs a free shuttle to 2 trail heads to pick up hikers.

A week in review
Peace
There are no words to describe the majestic scenery we walk through on a daily basis.  It is breath taking.   Each rock perch that juts out over an expanse of mountains and valleys is a reward hard earned for certain.
As we walk, climb and sometimes crawl along there is an overwhelming peacefulness, that if you get out of your own thoughts Long enough, settles over you like a welcome gift. The breeze ruffles the leaves above you as your feet whisper through those fallen, birds sing and still all around you is a profound hush.
There are no errands to run.  No calls to make or appointments to schedule.   No grocery list sits un-shopped on a countertop.  You begin to realize a need to accept the simplicity of making do with what you have out on the trail regardless of what you may want.
The very first day out on Springer Mountain a hunter on the trail stopped and asked if we were headed to Maine.  When we told him we were he asked if he could pray with us.  He said a really nice prayer that has stayed with me a hundred miles now.
This morning we had breakfast at a local favorite restaurant.   There was a WWII Veteran sitting with his family.  I had thanked him for his service, when he asked if we were thru hiking to Maine.  When I answered yes, he asked if he could say a prayer.  His voice wavered a bit as he spoke,  But with true-blue eyes in an age weathered face of wisdom he delivered a short and eloquent blessing.
Peace.
After the prayer the Veteran named Joe looked at me said
“You know, you’re going to have a lot of trials along the way. “
I smiled and said, “yes, I know.  But as long as he apologizes,  it will be just fine.”
Tomorrow I’m going to get up and go for a walk in the mountains.
Peace.

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660695,"Started out on the trail at 8:15 in wind and rain and temperature at 35 degrees. It actually wasn't too bad if we kept moving.  The rain lasted till about 11:00 and then thick fog moved in. It was so quiet on the trail today. Guess only a few of us were brave enough.
We planned on going 7.5 miles to the next shelter but we were making good time so decided to make it 9.5 to Wayah Gap picnic area. We found a clearing that had 3 tenting sites with picnic tables. We finished setting up the tent just as it started sprinkling pretty good.  Boiled water for our dinners and sat at the picnic table eating in the light rain.
We figured we wouldn't see anyone else as this tenting spot was kind of hard to find but another couple our age showed up as we were finishing up dinner. (Cautious and Cardiac) are from Minnisota and are also thru hiking to Maine. Cautious gave us some homemade chocolate chip cookies which we scarffed right down.   That was a treat.   
We were in the tent and watching a movie by 6pm. It felt good to be out of the rain and into warm down quilts for the evening. 
We received a text from Hopper, whom we've been spending time with in trail towns. His feet have been bothering him for a while on the trail and he has decided to head home. We're sad about that because we all hit it off good and thought we'd be hiking all the way to Maine together. Another hiker (Boone) has also left the trail with knee problems.  That was kind of our Tramley.  We'd been hiking and leapfrogging each other since our third day on trail.  It was over before we even realized we had a Tramley,  that's a bit of a hit to the morale.  In the end we all have to do what's best for ourselves.
The next few days are supposed to be sunny and in the upper 40s to 50s but will be in the low 20s at night. Good hiking Temps and we're glad we have warm sleeping systems. It looks like we will get to the Smokey Mountains in about 5 more days. We sent a resupply box with food and some warm clothes items north to Fontana Dam which is our last stop before the big climb.

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660698,"Chilly morning with frost and frozen rain on the tent. Picky Eater had a hard time getting the bear bag down from the tree branch because the lines had frozen up. But when Grinch is waiting for coffee we find a way, and fast!
Took our time packing up this morning hoping the sun would warm things up a bit. Just as we finished a group of people showed up in pickup trucks and started setting up to cook pancake breakfasts for thru hikers coming along the trail. We were halfway up a mountain in the middle of nowhere so they must have had a fun ride up. It was already after 9am so we grabbed an apple and orange and headed on our way.
The temperature struggled to get above freezing all day today, usually only when we were down in a Gap. As soon as we climbed up a bit all the trees were frosted and the wind picked up. You could see where the fog was moving thru and leaving a white frost in its path. We stopped often to either put layers of clothing on or take layers off.  We climbed out of the ice  fog and clouds to sunshine and crisp temperatures then back down into the ice fog and clouds. It was the same all day.  Later in the afternoon  we  climbed into stunning  vista's as the fog finally lifted.
We are very happy so far with our clothing gear. Everything is put on in layers trying to stay in the range of not being cold but also not sweating.   The kids seem to achieve  this by simply wearing shorts and t shirts.  None of them slowed down to chat today.  The one we call Joe Spicolli slowed his crazy pace enough to vociferously  and vehemently  express his great joy about the pancake breakfast trail magic.
We hiked 8.8 miles today to a tent site at Burningtown Gap. We leapfrogged with Cardiac and Cautious most of the day. Our tents are set up near each other tonight but not much socializing as it's already below 30 degrees and supposed to get down to 19 tonight. Everyone is bundled up in sleeping quilts for the night by 6:00.

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660760,"We slept pretty good last night considering the temperature dropped down to 16 degrees. We slept with our water bottles, water filters and cell phones with us inside our quilts so nothing would freeze. The hard part was getting out of the tent and packing up for the day's trek.
We had planned to go 7 miles to the next shelter area but since it wasn't going to get above 32 all day and tonight was expected to get down to 20 again we made an executive decision together.  It's 12.8 miles to Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) and a warm bunkhouse bed for the night.
NOC is an outfitter, lodge, rafting, general store, restaurant and caters to thru hikers. We were able to get a 2 bed bunkhouse for $50 a night. Nothing fancy but it will let us warm up and have a burger or two.
On our maps, today's hike looked like it was going to be the normal ups and down mountains and then a 6 mile long gradual descent that ended at NOC. The last 6 miles ended up being a cross between 3 ft wide ridge walk with steep dropoffs and straight descent that required sliding down to the next footing. We did just fine but it was cold and it ended up taking 10 hours to complete.  Certainly our most challenging section yet but the views were amazing.  We climbed up to an Eagle's nest then shimmered down the other side.   There was no Eagle or nest, but that's all there was room for on that micro peak.
You can always tell when civilization is again near.  Clean, nicely dressed, good smelling people start showing up on trail.  Your head plays a trick on you and you don't believe what you're seeing for a nano second, then you realize you'll be descending  to a parking lot soon.  There's always hope for trail magic. 
We arrived at the NOC just after 7pm. Good thing we booked our bunk online in the morning because everything was closed and they had our key waiting. We cooked our meals in the community kitchen. Restaurant burgers will have to wait till tomorrow. We decided to stay another night so we can take advantage of the restaurant and resupply for our next section.

We were even able to eat real food at the restaurant here at Nantahala Outdoor Center. Tonight we're repacking our backpacks to be ready to go in the morning.
We purchased our permits to thru hike the Smokey Mountains online a couple weeks ago. We will print them out here as this is the last chance to do so before we start them on Sunday or Monday. We are required to drop a copy of the permit at the start and have a copy with us till we finish 70 miles later. The Smokey Mountains are known for unpredictable weather this time of year. Last week the lows were single digits but so far it's looking good for next week. We're expecting that section to take 7 days so we'll have food for at least 6 nights. (Heavy packs to start).
We knew all this hiking and climbing would be a great weight loss program and it is. We are both monitoring and learning what and how much each of us need to maintain enough energy and muscle mass. The difficult part is that our hiker hunger hasn't quite kicked in on the trail yet. But it will. Grinch bought packs of Spam for Picky Eater to add to his meals. We've also been adding electrolytes to our water bottles. 
Tomorrow's hike starts with a 6 mile 3000 ft. hike up Cheoah Bald. We're planning on going 7 miles to the 1st shelter but may cut that back if needed. Especially if there is more boulder climbing. 'A Walk in the Woods' has to be the most misguided book title ever.
We enjoyed a good chat with Spicolli whose trail name we found out is 700.  He is doing the AT as his final leg of the triple crown.  We call his hiking buddy Tarzan because of his unique and loud vocalizations in the forest.  We'll see if he adopts it as his trail name.  He seemed to like it.  They are both fun to chat with and will sail through the Smokies ahead of us.   Hopefully  we see them.","Nantahala Outdoor center

 A six mile 3000ft climb to start the day. Within 1 mile we already dropped our layers and were down to shorts. 
We heard a rooster crowing a few times during the day. It was off in the distance and probably at a farm down in the valley. Grinch says Bigfoots can mimic different sounds and are known to make crowing sounds as well as owl and coyote calls.   Picky Eater doesn't want those thoughts when going to sleep on a mountain in the middle of the woods.  But we have heard some pretty strange howls throughout  the mountains.
Today was perfect hiking weather. Mid 40s to mid 50s with sunshine and a slight breeze. We took our time and arrived at Sassafras Gap Shelter about 4:30 not feeling too tired out. No one else was there so for a minute we thought we might be alone tonight. Then 4 other hikers arrived. No trail names yet, but all good folks.  Everyone tended to their chores, ate and got ready to call it a night early.  Picky Eater has passed over into the realm of spam.

There were a few snorers but we just put our earbuds in.  We listen to music and it doesn't take long to fall asleep. 
The first hikers got moving around  8am and by 8:30 everyone was busy packing up their gear. Seemed like no one was in a hurry to start out in the rain. We all had coffee and chatted while Anderson made coffee for his wife and gave it to her so she could stay bundled in her sleeping  bag.
We got going about 9:45 in 20 mph winds with the rain. The wind rolled the fog up the mountains  and through the trees.  Visibility  was low and the vistas were hidden from view.
As usual the day started out with a steep climb out of the gap where the shelter was. The trail leveled out along ridges most of the day but it rained on and off and stayed windy.
We were headed to Brown Fork gap shelter which was a 9.2 mile day. The shelter only holds 6 hikers so we were hoping to arrive before it was full so we wouldn't have to set up the tent in the rain. Every other hiker hopes for exactly the same. 
The last couple miles was quite the climb and we could hear hikers gaining on us when we were about a half mile from the shelter. Thats when Picky Eater decided he wasn't going to surrender a comfy spot for us in the shelter to a couple long haired hippies so easily.  It was Picky Eater by a nose followed by Spicolli (700) and Tarzan by a length. 
 The hike turned into a brisk walk, then a fast jog, bordering on a dead run.  Picky Eater held them on the rail, but lost his bid right before the turnoff to the shelter.  The two acknowledged  each other with a grin as Spicolli squeeked by. 
The shelter ended up being pretty full. Offers were made to squeeze us in but we opted to go ahead and set up the tent in the blowing rain. We set up fast and we were inside the tent with dry clothes and boiling water for dinner in no time. We're glad to be in our own space for the night. There are 9 hikers in the 6 person shelter.  
Supposed to get down to 26 tonight and a pretty decent day for hiking tomorrow, sunny and in the 40s. We have 2 days to go 12 miles to get to Fontana Dam to pick up our resupply and start the Smokies on Monday.  Hopefully  there's a good restaurant in there somewhere.","Sassafras Gap Shelter

Hope 
There sure is a lot to hope for along this 2183 mile trail (give or take)
“ But if we hope for what we do not yet have we wait for it patiently. “  Romans 8:25
Hope  can relate to the very small, that at times becomes paramount…..”I hope I like the sandwich I ordered because  I will be eating every bite of it”.  When you’re burning 4000 calories  a day,  what you eat becomes  very important.  And can become a hikers biggest worry.  “ I hope I’m going to be able to stomach the 6lbs of food I have in my backpack.”  Sometimes, as it turns out, you can’t. 
And as hope relates to the very important…..“ I hope my family is ok.” , “ I hope we make it to Katahdin. “ , “I hope we don’t get injured”. “ I hope there’s a restaurant open when we make it to town.”……..”I hope there’s a couple spots left in the shelter”……… “I hope there’s  a couple bunks left in the hostel.”
“And hope does not put us to shame because God’s love has been  poured  out into  us through  the holy spirit “  .   Romans 5:5
Our hopes  have certainly not been in vain.  Hope is a real thing with real benefits and when you are out here walking from shelter to shelter, campsite to campsite,  Town to town, hope becomes a very tangible part of the day.  
And when you look at the road ahead  and what we are hoping to accomplish,  well God becomes very real.
When you look at the paths we’ve traveled and the,  at times,  indescribable beauty all around, God becomes very real.
When you hope to see again the people he’s placed for a short time on these same pathways , God becomes very real .
Now all of this hope began with a sandwich and I will tell you, hope did not disappoint  me.  There was crumb none left on my plate.  
Hope is our steady companion along this journey.   I can’t see that  changing.  I hope it doesn’t.
Tomorrow  I’m going to get up and go for a walk in the mountains .","Brown Fork Gap shelter 
",Cable Gap shelter,"Mar 18, Sat",6.30
Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661043,"Yesterday we hiked 6.3 miles to Cable Gap Shelter. It was a fairly easy day as AT hiking goes. About halfway we found a sunny spot, pulled out all our wet gear and hung it to dry. That's the first time we've stopped hiking and taken a break like that.  It was nice. Chatted with hikers as they went by about the night before; cold. rain.  Anderson and Jessica came by and related their budget hostel tale that would have been well suited for a campfire.  Their hostel guy picked them up and drove them up a mountain road to a single wide trailer on the side of the mountain.   No one else was there.  They are a young couple.  The guy said he'd be back to pick them up in the morning.   Jessica said it looked like the guy's gramma had just moved out.  They made it back to the trail fine.  Hikers beware!
When we got to Cable Gap no one else was staying in the shelter for the night so we had it to ourselves. It was a 6 person log shelter that looked like a tornado could come thru and we'd still be fine. The only problem was that the floor was warped on both ends so it really only slept 2 comfortably in the middle. Perfect.
This morning was another chilly one. Right around 18 degrees. Picky Eater went and got the food bags, and made coffee.  Grinch got her coffee while still bundled in her quilt,  Anderson style.  We enjoyed our morning coffees bundled up in our quilts which warmed us up just enough to have the courage to pack up for the day's hike. 
Today's hike was another short one into Fontana Dam.  We shipped a resupply package and some cold weather gear there some time ago. So the plan was to pick up our resupply, buy a couple more days resupply and stay the night at the Fontana Shelter before starting the Smokies in the morning. But first things first! 
We hit the Fontana lodge restaurant for burgers, fries, salad, and beers. It was awesome.  It is such a motivator on trail to know a  bacon cheeseburger awaits you at the next hop off point.  Our steps were quick and light all the way down the mountain. 
The Fontana shelter is known as the Fontana Hilton because it is a well built 2 story that holds 24 hikers, overlooks the Fontana Lake and dam, has a charging station and restrooms and showers nearby. Multiple picnic tables and a huge fire ring surrounded  by benches. A Thru hiker's dream. 
 Cereal Killer and Poncho had a roaring Blaze going when we arrived, and by dusk it was standing room only while trail stories flew in quick succession. 
There was also 2 sets of people handing out trail magic when we got there. Extra snacks for our packs and free beer at the fire tonight. Chicken and biscuits , cookies. Apple pie, and all kinds of snacks.   This is certainly the Hilton of shelters. 
There were about 20 hikers here at the shelter by 7pm, so I emagine it'll be full tonight. We made sure our earbuds are fully charged. It'll probably stay noisy till 9:00 then the snorers take over. It's supposed to get down to 20 but there's not much wind so it should be comfortable sleeping. It'll be interesting with 20 or so hikers all packing up at the same time in the morning. 
Tomorrow starts with a steep 7 mile ascent and a total of 12 miles to Mollies ridge shelter. The first couple days in the Smokies will be the toughest then it should level off. Also, we're packing 6 nights of food, extra cooking fuel and extra clothes, so our packs will be the heaviest they've been. We're planning on tenting near the shelter because it'll probably be full before we get there.
Starting tomorrow it'll be 10 days before we get to a town again. We'll look forward to a couple nights in Hot Springs, NC and the food and showers that go with it.
Have no idea what cell service will be like all week so we will update the journal when service allows.","Cable Gap shelter

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661134,"Hikers started moving around the Fontana Hilton at 7am this morning. There was a beautiful sunrise over the lake and Poncho and Crazy Korean made a big fire in the fire pit. I don't think we're going to have our morning coffee next to such a warm fire too often on the trail. We lingered, enjoying the coffee and warmth while Poncho and Preacher talked Bible.  The only thing missing was a lazy harmonica playing softly in the distance. 
We had everything packed up and hit the trail at 9:00am. The first mile or so wasn't much of a trail. It was a road that went over Fontana Dam.  The road was closed due to dam work.  So no dam traffic was allowed.  The dam workers were everywhere.   We could wander across the road from one dam side to the other.  It was amazing how large the dam is. The views were spectacular! I hope it shows in the pictures we post.
After the road walk the rest of today's 12 mile hike was pretty much straight up heading into the Smokies. It stayed clear all day and the views made the tough climb just a bit more tolerable. While the day was tough. It was doable. And we were treated to a birdseye view of the famous Smokey Mountain  Vistas.  We're both glad we didn't have to do this climb 3 weeks ago. Thankfully we're starting to get trail legs.
We deposited the bottom half of our permits into a box heading in this morning. The top half we keep with us and deposit at the finish. It says we have 8 days to complete the Smokies but I'm sure we'd be OK a day or 2 longer.  Well, except we only brought 6 nights worth food. The permits were $20 each when we purchased them but went up to $40 each as of March 1st.
We arrived at Mollies Ridge Shelter about 6pm.  Grinch said her legs felt like green jello.  I think we were both a bit tired  and It felt like the temperature started dropping as soon as we got there. There was room in the shelter but we opted to set up our tent and get a good warm night's sleep. 
We set up, got water, ate and were in the tent by 7:30. The AT weather site says a low of 29 degrees here for tonight but it already feels a bit colder. Should be a nice day tomorrow.","Fontana Dam Shelter

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661136,"We didn't think it would be so chilly this morning but the shelter area was up on a ridge so the wind was blowing pretty good. It was going to be too windy for our cook stove so we opted to pack up and have coffee down the trail. About a mile up the trail we found a gap protected from the wind  and we pulled out our stove and boiled water for coffee. We were one of the first to leave but it didn't take Long for a few other mature hikers to pass by.  The youngins sleep late, pack up around noon then go flying past us at some point in the day.
Looking at our elevation maps for the day we thought today's hike would be much easier than yesterday. The weather was certainly nicer, it got up to the mid 40s and was sunny all day. There were some nice rolling hill sections that looked like they were old overgrown homestead grazing areas or orchards.
 But then came the climb up Rocky Top. Straight up for a mile and then straight down . But the views……you understand why there are songs about it.
We stopped at Spence Field shelter about 6 miles into the day to take a break and have a snack with coffee. There were 3 other hikers there with us.  We enjoyed coffee and hot cocoa with Dang B
ird and the Mad Scottsman.  Remarks were made about the brand new privy that was built wheelchair accessible with handicap hardware throughout.   We chatted, and enjoyed the sunshine.
 By the time we left it was 2:30 and we were thinking it would take till 6:00 to get to Derrick Knob Shelter about 6 more miles up the trail. It turned out to be steep ups and downs with long sections of loose rocks, frozen muddy sections, frozen falls to navigate and one final steep 1.5 climb into the shelter. 
We arrived at 8:00 in the dark with our headlamps on. An 11 hour day of hiking. The shelter was pretty full but it had a fireplace in it and someone had a roaring fire going. We chatted for a bit and decided to set up our tent so we could sleep in.  Yes.  Sleep in!
We got set up and into our quilts by 9:00. Didn't feel like heating up meals so our dinner consisted of meat snacks, candy bars and grandma's cookies. The weather is calling for some snow and freezing rain tonight but at least the temperature is a little warmer at 37 degrees. Boy those hot showers when we get to Hot Springs in 6 days are going to feel great.
Planning a shorter day tomorrow.  It's supposed to rain on and off and we need to recoup from the last two days which were the most challenging so far. We're doing good. 
We knew starting out this early would mean colder nights. Actually we feel pretty fortunate that we haven't had to deal with snow in the Smokies. It looks like Thursday and Friday are going to be in the 60s. The hardest part right now is that our packs are heavy with the added food and warm gear for this section. Picky Eater is hoping for a warmer evening so he can get rid of 12 ounces by enjoying the can of craft beer he's been carrying for 2 days.","Mollies Ridge

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661137,"Stayed in the tent till 9:00 staying warm and putting off packing up in the light rain as long as possible.  Thoughts and conversations take place, lets stay in the tent today and take a zero. (Zero mile day)  watch movies, eat food. Drink coffee.  As good as the all sounds, the Smokies rangers want you through in 7 days. We only have six days of food which is mediocre at best as far as calorie  needs.  So pushing  on is a must.  But it's fun to entertain the thought. 
Finally got all packed up and moved into the shelter to make some coffee and hang out with a few other hikers before heading out at 11:00. Papa Steve and Kitchen Sink had a roaring fire going in the shelter fireplace.  It made the blowing rain outside a tolerable certainty.  We enjoyed our coffee.
We weren't in a hurry because we were only going to the next shelter 5.7 miles away.
Today's hike was wet and muddy but the climbs were a little more subdued than the previous two days. Lots of fog and clouds so no beautiful vistas to look at today.  But in the minds eye, they were spectacular. 
We had one goal: Get to the next shelter and out of wet gear. We passed one other thru hiker today. Hiram Hikes has a you tube channel of his hike.  We watched a couple of his early videos before we started. He filled us in on some of the trail in front of us and we did the same for him on Southbound sections.
We got to Silers Bald shelter about 3:15 wet, mud slogged and cold.  True to Smokey Mountain reputation, tapering off rain and rising temperatures  turned into high winds , blowing rain and intermittent freezing rain with temps dropping back down to just above freezing. 
There were 2 other hikers at the shelter. Iron Will had a fire going and chatty Julie was helping him break up sticks.  He had gathered half a forest of tree branches to break up to keep it going. It really was a dream come true for a couple hikers with wet gear and feet.
 We claimed our sleeping spot in the loft,  spread out our sleeping pads and started cooking dinner.  We helped break down some of the branches for firewood and other hikers helped out as they arrived.  We retreated to our warm quilts by 6:00. Although we hung our bear bags away from the shelter, we snuck baggies of snacks into our quilts to help us get to sleep. 
By 7:00 there were already a dozen hikers in the shelter. It was still raining so it looked like everyone was looking to stay out of the element for tonight. 
Tomorrow we'll pass some milestones.  We will pass the  halfway point of the Smokies as well as the 200 mile mark of the AT. We'll also climb up to Clingmans Dome, the highest point on the entire Appalachian trail at 6612 feet.","Derrick Knob Shelter

It was still raining and they had hiked 19 miles, Drive thru and Leaf were soaked and shivering. Fortunately the fire was still going and everyone made room for them in the sleeping area.  Preacher showed up just after.  Everyone slid down and made room.  The Smokies can be a tough place to weather out a storm.   And deadly if you under estimate them or are unprepared. 
Grinch woke up first and retrieved our bear bags so we could have coffee sitting in our quilts. We were packed up and headed up trail by 9:30. We stopped at another shelter that was right on the trail about 2 miles in and filled our waters. There was cell service so we were able to upload pictures and the last 3 days trail journals.
Another 3 miles straight up was Clingmans Dome. Some of the most beautiful trail yet. Green moss and pine forest. The temperature wasn't as warm as we hoped but it was the warmest in a week and the sun peeked through on and off.  We climbed up the concrete monstrosity which was peculiar in its environment, but were treated to the best views of the day after a short walk up the circular concrete pathway. 
We were warned by Sunshine, a sobo hiker heading to the Benton McKay that the trail down from Clingmans Dome was pretty icy and she wasn't kidding.  A good 2 mile stretch was slow going. It was melting fast but was still very slippery.
We arrived at Mt Collins shelter about 5:30. Another 2 story shelter that slept 12. It was full again tonight and there were also about 6 tents set up. The spring for water was quite the hike down across muddy, icy side trail. 
We set up our sleeping spots in the upper deck and made our dinners and chatted. Temperature feels like upper 40s so it should be good sleeping.","Silers Bald shelter

Very nice day of hiking today. Not many mountain views as we were in a green tunnel pine forest most of the day. We had a long up and down descent into Newfound Gap which was a parking lot full of day tourists and about a hundred cars. Jessica and Anderson were getting picked up by family there and they were set up with trail magic for thru hikers. We drank sodas and ate handfuls of candy bars and chips. They also encouraged us to take as much with us as we want. Hiker hunger has been kicking in soooo…
When we left Newfound Gap we had a 3.5 mile hike mostly straight up to get to Icewater Spring Shelter. Since we were so close to the parking lot there were a lot of day hikers along the way.
They were clean and smelled like fabric softener.   Grinch kept telling everyone how clean they looked.
We were able to keep pace on this long upward climb with day hikers without packs.  Some of them were impressed and said so.  We were impressed too. A few of them stopped us and asked questions when they figured out we were hiking the whole AT.
Arrived at the shelter by 3pm to sunny warm temperatures.  It's been a while and long anticipated.  It was a treat to get there so early and be able to take our time getting set up for the night. There were bout 8 hikers in the shelter so far but we're expecting heavy rain, wind and thunder tonight so there will most likely be more showing up. There's a fire going in the fireplace and we all brought handfuls of firewood from the area.
We were in our quilts by 7:00 but most everyone else is up chatting led by Groceries who is the most colorful in conversation.  We plan on sleeping in a bit since it's going to be raining in the morning.  The plan is to go 7.4 miles tomorrow but if the weather gets bad we'll hunker down here.  We're among friends who will do the same.","Mt.

We were one of the first ones there so we got a good spot on the lower level. Soon, 8 hikers showed up that were a  group doing an overnight hike. It ended up being a pretty full house. The leader of the group, who we called ""little focker"" (like from that one movie) came in waving his arms saying they had permits for 8 spots.  It was obvious he was ready for battle.  Picky Eater and Grinch looked at each other and our two spots taken in the 18 spot shelter, Grinch said if he counted slowly he'd see there was plenty  of room.  
We're used to Marijuana smell during the evening as it seems to go along with a lot of the younger hiker crowd. But the group of 8 overnighter hikers added shots of whiskey to the mix and ended up staying up late telling their stories to each other.  We're used to quiet shelters after 7 or 8pm so the sleep wasn't the best.  At 9:30 Grinch finally told little focker and the last two loud talkers that it was time for inside voices.  They looked a little stunned but obliged Grinch.
We were the first ones up having coffee at 6am and on the trail by 7:30. Wanted to make it to Cosby Knob Shelter 12.9 miles up the trail at a decent time. It was sprinkling a little when we started but turned into a warm sunny day. Really nice hiking with spectacular views.  We started and ended the day with long climbs but the terrain in between was ridgewalks with some technical parts. The second half of the Smokies is more beautiful than the first. The terrain seems to be a little more manageable too.  
Only ran into 1 other hiker today. Furlough was doing a section hike of the whole Smokies.  He got the trail name because his wife let him off for 5 days to be away from housework and the kids. We made excellent time today and got to the shelter by 4:30. We were happy to see the whole gang we'd been hiking around all there. We had done a shorter day the night before and they had all moved ahead.  There was some discussion with Will Rogers about changing his traill name to Silver Alert after he wandered away from camp a couple times.  He doesn't get lost,  but we all have learned to keep an eye on him.

We made great time on our way out and there was a group of people set up with trail magic about 2.5 miles from the end. We sat down and munched on snacks, grapes and had pops. The rest of our trail family showed up and they were heading to the same hostel. 
Standing Bear hostel is one of the iconic places on the AT. There are a couple bunkhouses and several outbuildings for private sleeping quarters. It looks like it was put together in the early 70s and has a stream running thru the center. A little elbow work and it could be a nice place. Unfortunately it was a little scary.   Some of the help and half of the hikers were smoking pot from sun up till sun down. The bed mattresses were creepy and the pillows looked like hand me downs from a prison.  The bathrooms were Porta John's. They did cook dinner and breakfast for $12 but we didn't take part.  We'll have stories to tell for a while.
One good thing is we were able to buy a couple beers and chat with some of the hikers we'd met along the trail. No one left their wallets unattended.","Cosby Knob shelter

We got back to the Hostel, packed our packs and were on the trail by 12:30.

Frosty and Drive-thru were already there and a few more than that standing around.  We were spoiled in the smokies with large shelters and fire places.  It's a low near freezing tonight so we opted to set up our tent tonight, watch a movie and catch up on sleep that we lacked last night.

Sounds like everyone in the group was planning on a longer hike today except us. We plan on doing a long day tomorrow.  We like to get up early and get going on long days so we're not hiking into the evening.
The first half of today's hike was straight up again.  It's always tough but seems like our bodies are adjusting to it and we recover faster. We arrived at Max Patch about 5.5 miles into the day after climbing up a long earthin and log stairs. Max Patch is a large field on the top of a mountain that is surrounded 360 degrees by mountain views as far as you can see. Picture The Sound of Music on steroids. Today being a clear and sunny day made it even more spectacular.  This area used to be a well used camping area because of the sunrises and sunsets but is now more restricted to protect the habitat.  We hung out for a bit then continued for a half mile to the other end of Max Patch to begin our decent.
On our way down we met Midnight Rider. He had thru hiked the pacific Crest trail 2 years ago and could tell we were thru hikers. You could tell he was really excited to meet us and he wished us a good safe trip.
The rest of the day was downhill and we arrived at Roaring Fork Shelter about 3pm. There were 2 younger hikers there having a snack but they were moving on. We hadn't planned on staying in the shelter but it was a well built log structure with a solid flat floor so we laid out our pads and claimed our spots. We cooked our dinners and ate, Picky Eater packed out a beer 15 miles ago so we filled our titanium mugs and enjoyed it in the warm sun.

We planned a while ago to spend 3 nights at Laughing Heart Hostel resting and getting away from the trail for a bit. Hot Springs is a small community surrounded by mountains and the Appalachian Trail runs right through the town. There's a few hostels, a Dollar General, an outfitter and a brewery. Everything a hiker could ask for. People were friendly and welcoming.   Doors were opened for us all along the way,followed by ""have a blessed day!"".
Laughing Heart lodge and hostel is the first thing you come to after the descent into town. The trail goes right through the parking lot. We were able to get a private room for the three nights that included a shower and laundry, both of which were needed badly.  There were about 20 other hikers staying in the hostel and another 10 tents set up outside each night. The owners really took care of us by keeping the place clean, making sure there was a fire each night and providing free food for us as the power in town was out for 2 days. Burgers on the grill, omelets for breakfast and pizza for everyone.  It'll be hard to leave.
Walking into town we ran into many hikers we've met on the trail.  Most of them taking multiple days off to recoup. We were able to resupply our food, pick up a few needed gear items and have a few at the brewery.  A large bonfire was going when we got back to Laughing  Heart.  Conversations ranged from Spirit Talismans on the trail to real estate prices to everything food related. 
We both went through our backpacks and downsized our gear to lighten our packs a bit. We're sending another box home, mostly cold weather gear. The next food resupply will be about 45 miles down the trail. We may need to hitch a ride into Irwin and find a grocery store. Probably won't be taking any 3 day vacations for a while. We planned out a few days off after the Smokies and it was a welcome rest.  
One thing about staying at hostels is it is the quickest way to have all your crazy thoughts and feelings normalized by other hikers having all the same struggles, aches and fatigue.   No matter your age or physical condition, struggles happen. 
Everyone has been having weird deep dreams along the trail which turn into great conversation at the campfire. Picky Eater dreamed about 3 older Ukrainian women who were playing a traditional game where they had to toss a ball up a steps and his job was to keep retrieving it. Every time he came back they told him how wonderful his hair was. 
Looks like some warmer weather is coming in this week. We may see some rain but the temperatures will hit the 70s a few days in the mountains.  We are looking forward to warmer nights and will still be ready for spring storms along the way.","Deer Park mtn shelter

Power was still out (3 days now) but we were able to stop at a convenient store that was accepting cash and buy a few hunneybuns to add to our food bags (750 calories each!). 2.5 mile climb out of Hot Springs to start the day.   We sent another box home with extra clothes and a few odds and ends.  We lightened our packs another 4lbs each.  What a difference !:
The trail today wasn't necessarily hard or real steep but it was enough of an incline to tire us out after 3 days off sitting around relaxing. Kind of like a welcome back, now get to work.  This would be a much easier trail if there weren't  all these mountains in the way!

Once we were on the trail we switch to our bright lights which illuminate the trail and the swirling mist.
With the dark and the fog and us being the only ones out on the trail it was eerie quiet for a couple hours. As the sun rose the birds started singing just one or two at first, then the forest echoed with their cheery good mornings. 
As usual, the day started out with a steep climb. Halfway through the day we hit a 2 mile section of boulders, a climb up and down that took a few hours to get thru. At the top was Howard's rock.  It was the tippy top of the climb and there wasn't room for anything but Howard's rock and two feet.  Not sure who Howard was  but as Grinch put it ""Howards tend to be great people.""  We passed the Big Butt bypass and went on to climb the big butt.  Heading that way?  Take the Bypass! 
The rest of the day was an easier meandering trail through meadows and pine forest with blooming wildflowers and budding ferns and greens.  Picky Eater asked Where's grubhub when you need them?!
We passed the 300 mile mark halfway through the day! We can't say we have our trail legs yet but can sure tell our bodies are getting stronger every day. Our feet and ankles are strong but still sore after a 14 mile day as expected. The 2000 + foot descents also take a toll on the knees.

They made room for us and we all cooked our various dinners and chatted about the day and of course the food we wanted when in town next while we ate our hiker food. The winners were McDonalds and Cracker Barrel.  We got a spot in the shelter which was now full and there are a half dozen tents and hammocks scattered around.

The closest McDonald's was an 11 mile hike up over a mountain to a parking area where we would need to hitchhike or call for a shuttle another 15 miles into Erwin. TN.  But when it's your birthday on the trail and you want McDonalds, no mountain is too high to cross.  
We hiked with Dang Bird all day. All three of us felt great so we made good time and got to the parking area by 3:30.

Just imagine it's a river flowing and it lulls you to sleep. It was a calm night with maybe a sprinkle or two.
We had 2 options for today. Either hunker down in our tents or hike and get wet. The forecast was for rain all day with temps hovering around 50. We chose to hike 7.7 miles to Bald Mountain Shelter. Dang Bird has been hiking the same pace and distance as us so we all headed out together. 
5 minutes into the trail the steady blowing rain started. It never stopped. We all have pretty good rain gear for hiking but after a while it didn't matter. 2 hours into the hike we were all soaked thru and dreaming of a dry shelter. 
The trail had some pretty steady climbs but nothing too steep.  If it wasn't raining it was the kind of section to take your time in. All of us came close to falling in the mud several times on the downhills but we all kept a sense of humor. We never really knew how close to the shelter we were because no one wanted to take their phone out in rain.
In spite of the rain, we made great time and arrived at the shelter before 2:00pm. The 10 person space was already getting packed. Gear everywhere,  wet clothes hanging, everyone trying to get out of wet clothes at the same time. Everyone making room and everyone in good spirits. By 6pm there were already 16 hikers laid out on platforms meant for 10. 
It was mostly a young crowd in the shelter.  Jess and Anderson stopped by for lunch and were continuing to the next Gap to catch a shuttle.  It was great to see them again.   The kids were either talking about trading food, what foods they were craving (BLTs, Ribeyes, Spaghetti, blueberry pie)  and singing their favorite  Disney movie songs as many of them had performed them in a theater.  Sounds like they all met on trail and are hiking together……jukebox, girl scout, tacos, index, and a few others.  Jukebox  hikes with his dog Luna who happily travels over pads and bags to get to her favorite  people. 
 
Plenty of entertainment as we all huddled in our quilts to warm up from the day.  Thankfully,  our Xtra clothes, puffys and quilts stayed dry. We learned our lesson on that early on the trail. We have plastic compactor bags lining the inside of our backpacks and everything that needs to stay dry gets rolled up in that. We'll be putting wet shoes on in the morning though. 
Super thankful to be in a warm quilt in the shelter. It's forecast to be close to freezing tonight so our water filters will be tucked in with us. We may opt to get picked up at the Spivey Gap crossing 6 miles down the trail tomorrow as the forecast is the same and freezing temps tonight.
It's a good evening.","Sam's Gap

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661780,"Well, nothing really dried out during the night. The temperature dropped below freezing. Someone stretched para-cord lines across the shelter and we all hung gear and clothing to dry but it all froze solid. There were so many people in the shelter that no one slept on their own pad.  Grinch shared hers with Jukebox and his dog Luna.  And so on down the line.
Everyone started out in their sleeping clothes and puffy jackets.  The ultimate hiker no-no but with freezing temps and 6 miles to a pick up, we all did the same.   It was interesting putting on frozen shoes to start the day.
 We were the last ones to leave as we decided to go 5.7 miles to Spivey Gap and hitch a ride with Miss Janet again to Irwin. We needed to dry out and warm up.  Out of the 20 in the shelter, only two continued  forward.  Two SOBOs Irish and Prophet.
Cell service was pretty much non existent all day but we were able to get a text in to be picked up at 12:30. It started raining thru the day and was blowing pretty hard at the top of the mountains.  It wasn't snow so much as ice chunks blowing off the canopy above.  The wind was brisk so we kept it brisk as well.   We all were pretty comfortable and semi warm till we got to the parking area for pick up. We weren't sure our communication to be picked up went through and we waited for an hour and a half in the cold drizzle. 
Other than a few cars going by and a few hikers we were pretty remote, so when Miss Janet rolled in we were so happy.  Straight to a diner to eat then to a hotel. 
 
We were able to dry out all our gear, take showers and do laundry before ordering pizza for a second dinner. 
The day ended on the opposite  end of the spectrum.  But while we were all walking around to keep warm in an empty parking lot on a low traveled mountain road we all told stories that kept us laughing. 
Tomorrow is Easter so we are taking a zero day and working the phones to hitch a ride to church. Rumor has it that there's a breakfast afterwards. Don't have to tell a thru hiker that twice.
It was a great day!","Bald Mountain Shelter

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661931,"Stayed last night at Uncle Johnny's Hostel in Erwin. The weather turned nice so we are tenting it here for a few nights so we can hang out with other hikers, get rides to town for resupply and best of all; slackpack for a couple days. Slackpacking is when we get to leave our tent and heavy gear here and get dropped off down the trail to hike back with lightweight packs.
Today we hiked 11.1 miles from Spivey Gap north to Uncle Johnnys. A beautiful day of sunshine for a change. We were able to take our time and even stopped to make lunch at No Business shelter about halfway thru the day.
When we got back to Uncle Johnny's this afternoon there were quite a few more hikers here. The fire pit was going and it was interesting conversations. Usually trail related. Leaf keeps everyone going, a young West Point Grad now out of the military.  She is a dynamic conversationalist. 
Barefoot was there. Yep he's hiking the entire trail barefoot. Cuts all over his feet which he treats with superglue.
Scarface showed up. We met her earlier on the trail. Her trail name came from a previous hike when
She fell and did a faceplant into the rocks. She was excited to show us the bloody pictures as proof.  It wasn't  pretty. 
 There's also Sass, he's from South Africa, hiking with a hiker from Sweden. They have 6 month visas so they are pushing  the miles to be done in time.  They argued good naturedly with each other about who was more worried about making the six month deadline.  They are both young,  but nursing  overuse injuries.
Tomorrow we head out at 9am for one more day of slackpacking before packing up the tent and getting back down the trail away from civilization.","Spivey Gap

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661935,"Our ride dropped us off at Indian Grave Gap about 9:30 this morning. Picky Eater, Grinch, Dang Bird and Scarface all hiking together today. There was an older gentleman setting up chairs and food in the remote parking lot when we arrived. He was going to be handing out trail magic but we had already had our coffee and breakfasts so we moved on down the trail.
We were hiking 8.5 miles today, all downhill. Temperatures in the 60s and full sun. This was probably the most laid back and relaxing hiking day of the trail so far. We took our time and even stopped at Curly Maple Gap shelter for lunch and to chat with other hikers. If every day out here was like today there would probably be a lot more hikers doing the Appalachian Trail.  
There weren't a lot of distant mountain views today, but the trail was perfect. The smell of pine needles, the trees budding and the fresh flowers popping up every so often let us know warmer temperatures were finally here. 
We made it back to the Hostel by 2:00, an early finish. We had a couple hours to relax before we caught a shuttle in to the grocery store to resupply for our next week on the trail.
Uncle Johnnys offers a free shuttle to town for hikers. The shuttle bus is an old dial a ride type bus left over from the 80s. We asked the driver earlier if he would take us to Walmart and he said no, because they won't take the bus out onto the highway. Once we started moving down the road it was understood why. All 17 of us crammed into the 10 seats had fun holding on and were glad for the free ride anyway.
By 7:30 we were back at the hostel, packing our food resupply and drinking our wine. Today was a great day. Tomorrow we head back out for a 6 night stretch on the trail.","Uncle Johnnys

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661999,"Back to the trail this morning at 9:30. We enjoyed our stay tenting at Uncle Johnny's Hostel in Erwin but are happy that we get to be sleeping back out on the trail. It may seem kind of weird but you get accustomed to sleeping and relaxing in your tent away from everyone. It feels like home after a while. Even though it's only 5 ft wide and there's 2 of us we don't feel cramped and we have a good system. 
After 2 days of slackpacking,  it took some getting used to carrying our full packs again. We're loaded  qwith 6 days of food for this stretch.  We may have overdid it a bit. That seems to be the case every time we spend a couple nights near a town. Everything at the grocery store looks good until you have to carry it.  Hiker hunger is kicking in and we want food!
The hike today started off fairly easy then led into a couple steep climbs, a two miler up to beauty spot and a 3 mile rock scramble-climb up to Unaka Mountain at 5000 ft elevation. The trail was well maintained and as Grinch put it; not of the precarious nature.
The rest of the hike was mostly down hill to Cherry Gap shelter for an 8.8 mile day.  As usual the last mile of the day was uphill.  There were 6 hikers in the shelter and half a dozen or so tents tonight. We opted to set up the tent. It's supposed to be clear sky's tonight and there was a lot of flat spots perfect for a comfy nights sleep. 
It's a good crowd here tonight with lots of conversation and laughing.  We caught up to the fab four, a name for a group of kids hiking together that get along well and are creative in entertaining each other.  Barefoot showed up with a bandage wrap around one of his feet.  Turtle and pup showed up as well as several new faces.
We headed to the tent by 7:30. Can hear various conversations and laughing coming from the shelter and surrounding tents. It's a good night.","Indian Grave Gap

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662157,"Cell service has been pretty spotty the last few days so just now catching up on the journal. Also added new photos to the gallery. 
We've picked up the miles in the last few days averaging over 11 a day. Still some tough trail but nothing like the Smokies. It seems like every day begins with a climb and ends with a climb. We're really getting our trail legs so we aren't feeling exhausted on the steep mountain ascents until about 3:or 4 in the afternoon pushing to reach the shelter or tent spot by then.  There is fun along the way.  We'll come across Barefoot gathering edibles from the forest to add to his sandwiches.  Well, somewhat edible.  Some of it made him sick, he said.
Friday we hiked 13 miles to a tent spot just over Grassy Ridge Bald at 6100 ft. It was a long day and it started raining just before we got there. We're getting pretty good at setting up the tent fast so nothing got wet inside. It rained pretty good on and off all night so we cooked our dinners reaching out into the small vestibule of the tent. We hiked with Dang Bird and Scarface.
Saturday morning we planned on getting an early start but just as we finished our coffee it started raining again.  So back into the quilts for another hour. 
By 8:30 we had everything packed and hit the trail in the light sprinkles and heavy fog. We had 11 miles to hike for the day to get to a hostel in Roan Mountain where we planned a day off on Sunday. 
Early in today's hike we came across the fab four still hunkered in their quilts at the next shelter.  We gave them a hard time.  It was still raining on and off and the trail was covered in heavy fog. 
We took a .2 mile detour to Overmountain shelter, a large barn that is in rough shape but used to be a shelter. Supposedly it's being torn down soon. We're glad we got to see it as it's an iconic part of the trail. Grinch visited the privy located up a steep hill.  It was an open air style commode with a million dollar view.
Halfway thru today's hike we climbed over Little Hump mtn and Hump Mountain where most of the climbs were in thick fog. (See the word ""Hump"" on a hiking map?  Don't let the name fool you!) 
The skies cleared eventually and we were blessed with some of the most beautiful views of the trail so far. We were able to have lunch at the top before starting a 5 mile descent into Roan Mountain and The Station Hostel.  The long descents are a killer on the knees so a day off is going to be nice.  
The Station Hostel is an older building that is an iconic landmark of the trail. Clean showers, laundry and free breakfast. There's also a craft beer bar downstairs so we'll sleep good tonight. It's supposed to rain pretty good on Sunday, it'll be good to be off trail.  Our hostel hikers were all known….Jukebox, purple rain, the fab four and cloud walker, a young navy man leaving the trail in Damascus due to ankle issues.
We hit the 395 mile mark today and also finished up hiking through North Carolina. In a week we should be in Damascus,  VA and closing in on the 500 mile mark. Lord willing!","Cherry Gap Shelter 
",The Station Hostel (Roan Mountain),"Apr 15, Sat",33.60
Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662354,"A day off yesterday to recharge at The Station Hostel. We picked the perfect day. It was sunny and warm and then heavy rain in the late afternoon. 
4 of us hitched a ride in the back of a local's pickup to Dollar General for resupply. We're known as hiker trash on the trail and it was fitting that there were two bags of garbage between us. As soon as we were finished another local told us to hop in the back of his truck for the 3 mile ride back to the Hostel. After cleaning and organizing our packs we had the rest of the day to relax and have a few craft beers downstairs. Grinch played a few pounds of pool with leaf while other hikers pulled up favorite music videos.
Quite a few hikers showed up to get off trail before the rain so there was a lot of catching up and meeting new people.  The hostel is also a Harvest host spot for Van RVrs and a few showed up to park for free for the night. They were asking a lot of questions about the trail and we filled them in on hiker life.
Got up early Monday morning and packed our gear before heading down from the loft we slept in. We got rid of a few items that were Xtra weight and weighed our packs. With 4 days food and 1.5 litres water Picky Eater's pack weighed 28 lbs and Grinch's Weighed 24.  We both felt good about that weight and we should be able to lighten up more as the weather gets warmer.
The hostel offered free breakfast that tasted like home cooking. Picky Eater even cleaned his plate. We waited to get a ride ½ mile back to the trail but decided just to walk it so we could get going. It was 10:20 by the time we got started for the day.   It's a known fact that thru hiker will hike 2183 miles to Maine, but expect them to do an extra .5 and we're looking for ways out of it !
We all felt a bit sluggish today after a day off so it seemed a struggle to keep our normal pace.  We gave each other a hard time in good fun but Dang Bird finally got us going. Thankfully the trail was fairly easy and we passed by 2 beautiful large waterfalls before deciding to call it a day at Mountaineer Falls shelter 8.7 miles in. The shelter is one of the nicest on the trail so far with 3 stories. The water source is not far and is at the top of a waterfall. Only 4 of us sleeping in the large shelter.
Ron from Belgium is here so we had a great discussion about different hiking trails in Europe.  Like other hikers from other countries he has a 6 month visa to finish the trail.
The fab 4 showed up and were huddled in the tent area deciding if they were going to stay or move on for the night. Picky Eater went over to where they were and pretended to dig a cat hole right next to them with his mini shovel saying he was getting ready for the morning.  The forest erupted with their laughter as the figured out the joke.  They moved on.  After a night with them at the hostel we're ready for some peace and quiet.   They're good kids.

Temperatures are getting warmer so it's a little hot in the afternoons but we still managed to hike 12 miles to a great tent site with Grassy fields, a sunset and a sunrise view. Sometimes finding a tent site that's flat and not muddy is hard but this site was perfect. We all slept great so we decided to head all the way to Boots off Hostel  near Hampton,  TN where we could get a ride to town to resupply.  
We stopped at Laural Falls (Cover photo) halfway thru the day to snack and enjoy the view. This section of the trail is some of the most beautiful yet. The trail meandered thru the woods and other than a few climbs that were challenging it's getting easier. It must be, because we completed over 24 miles in two days. We're hoping to average 12 to 15 miles a day now with the occasional short day or zero day.
We arrived at Boots Off about 5:30, just in time to reserve a site and catch the 6:00 pm shuttle. The grocery store was small and other than being more expensive it had adequate resupply (and beer).

The temps were going to be above 80 and it's a nice relaxing place. They'll do our laundry for $5.00 and Rumer had it that there was going to be a free pizza dinner. 
The showers were the best we've had on the trail so far, although our standards have probably been lowered. A separate rustic outbuilding had 2 individual showers that utilized an overhead galvanized bucket with holes drilled in the bottom. 
We spent all day relaxing and chatting with the owner and other hikers. They had 20 pizzas delivered. No one went hungry.
Friday morning we packed up and headed out at 10am for a 9.3 mile hike to Vandeventer Shelter. The hike paralleled Watauga lake the entire way and when we arrived at the shelter we had a bird's eye view of the entire lake.

Lots of mud splash on the outside but we'll deal with that when the sun comes out. Mud has been a part of our life for 60 days now. Heard other hikers packing up early but we are in no hurry. 
Hiked 9.3 miles to Iron Mtn shelter. It's been a lot easier hiking lately so it didn't take Long, even with the late start. We filled up our waters a quarter mile before arriving at the shelter by 3:00. Only one hiker there so we got a couple spots for the night without having to set up the tent.
Got up early Sunday and hiked 3.6 to a parking area at TN 91 to hitch a ride into Damascus where we'll bunk for a couple nights. We figured we'd dry out our gear from the rain and shower/laundry. Grinch has warn out her shoes and there's a couple outfitters there to get new ones. Picky Eater says his will last for 1000 miles (We'll see).

We resupplied at dollar General and an outfitter in town had some good freeze dried meals.  Grinch had a healthy looking chicken soup and a couple of Picky Eater's chicken wing dinner.  The town is small.  No traffic light, but the people welcome you to town as you pass.
We relaxed and pretty much sat around hanging with other hikers the rest of the time. Treehouse was the manager and ran a tight ship.  He wasn't one for repetition so there were answer books posted all over the hostel.  By the time you read it, as strongly encouraged to do, the only thing left to talk about with Treehouse was hiking.   We chatted with Radish, a young hiker named for the red face that happens when climbing.  Radish's red alarms people. A section hiker. History was enjoying the hiker atmosphere.   Fun stories exchanged.  Dang Bird got new shoes.   We even got a nap in. (First one on the trail!) 
We're heading out early tomorrow hoping to do a long day with our fully stocked food supply. Grinch is saying she wants to do the long days when our food supplies are lighter.  we take it as it comes.  Body. Packs, weather, trail.  It's fun to try to plan!
Dang Bird showed up in the afternoon and will head out with us in the morning.  He had a bear encounter at one of the shelters yesterday. Seems the bears get used to stealing food from hanging hiker bags and food canisters. It wasn't too interested in the hikers, just the food. The cover picture is the bear.
The next 40 mile stretch should be pretty cool. We'll go thru Grayson Highlands where there are wild ponies for quite a bit of it. Should be some great pictures.  One of the comments on our map app said they had a hard time sleeping in their tent because of the pony shenanigans all night.  Looking forward to it. Looks like we'll start hitting some rain after the first couple days with night temperatures in the 30s. 
The Outfitter didn't have Grinches size in her trail shoes so we ordered online and are having them shipped to our next resupply town. 
The Hostel is full again tonight but it's a great crowd. Pretty much everyone that's made it this far has figured out the trail and is tough enough to go the whole way. Learning the physical part is out of the way and trail legs have developed. Now it's figuring out the mental part of getting up every day and hiking for another 5 months.   Almost 500 miles and we are both thankful to have our best friend along to keep each other from tumbling down the mental rabbit hole.","Broken Fiddle hostel

Chatted with Timber who's with his dog Jake. He told us about taking the Virginia Creeper trail out of Damascus for 10 miles and then meeting back up to the AT where it crosses. The Creeper trail is a 35 mile long bike trail that used to be a rail line. There's a 17 mile section that is popular with bikers from all over the country because it's down hill at a 2 % grade all the way to town. We were heading out of town so it was a slight ascent the whole 10 miles but a real easy gravel pathway that followed the Laurel Fork River the whole way. No mountain views but probably the most beautiful hike so far. We crossed over 20 restored railroad bridges crossing back and forth over the river and went thru the small community of Taylor's Valley. It may as well have been called Mayberry. The river is stocked with brown trout and would be a fly fishers heaven. 
When we reached the AT after crossing a long rail bridge there was a perfect camping area right on the river and we had our dinner next to a fire. What a perfect day! Picky Eater packed out 2 large beers for the three of us to split.
It wasn't long and Long John Silver and KP showed up to pitch their tents.  We were able to watch hikers crossing the trestle bridge above our campsites heading 2 miles up to the next shelter.  Barefoot crossed just before sunset.
Tomorrow we're back in the mountains with a 3.5 mile climb up Mt. Rogers, Virginia's highest point.

A month in review
Patience
They say being successful on a thru hike is 90% mental once you’ve made it through the initial body break down and build up.
Patience is an integral part of  sustaining the mental game.  Being patient with yourself, your abilities , your hiking partner, your body  and the daily challenges of the trail wrap themselves into one big ball of consternation when conditions are right.
No two days are the same, no two mountain ranges are the same, but keeping it simple and calling it one foot in front of the  other pairs it all down to an achievable goal.
Some days the weather is your ally, and other days it is a character in a cast of adversaries plotting a whole new chapter in the way you planned your story.  Patience and the act of putting one foot in front of the other keeps you moving forward.
Some days all things align and the day and miles can go off almost effortlessly.  It’s a payday of sorts for the perseverance of patience.  At the end of the day you fall asleep with a smile and look forward to sunrise.
Achieving patience and hanging on to it is as illusive as finding the legendary Sasquatch .  Being simply a mortal human, patience is a work in progress each and every day.  I pray for patience in all aspects of trail life, but the hardest is finding patience  with myself and hanging on to it.  It’s really no different than everyday life no matter where you are or what you are doing.   Out here the miles lend plenty of time to find opportunities to ask for patience.  My cup runneth over.
“But they that wait upon the Lord will mount up with wings of eagles.  They shall run and not grow weary. They shall walk and not grow faint.”  Isaiah 40:31
Tomorrow I’m going to get up and go for a walk in the mountains .","

Once again we took our time packing up. It was such a nice camping spot on the river that deserved a few cups of coffee. Most of the hikers we come across seem to pack up and leave as early as possible.  We tend to chat and take our time but we keep seeing them at the end of the day anyway.
Today's hike was a longer one but not too many steep climbs until the last few miles where it was pretty much boulder hopping until we reached Thomas Knob Shelter. We arrived about 8pm with our headlamps on and it looked like the shelter had room but it was dark. Everyone was already in their sleeping bags and it didn't feel like anyone wanted to move over from their comfy spots so we opted to move on and set up our tents. Although we were tired and didn't finish setting up till 10:00 we were glad to be in our tents without a crowd.
Halfway through the day we ran into some trail magic at a road crossing.  Wheels was there. He hiked the trail in 2018 and was returning to hand out snacks. He gave us each a beer that we hiked out for tonight. 'A toast to Wheels!'
4-27
We packed up to another warm morning. Only one mile into the day we crossed the 500 mile mark! That's one photo op that we truly earned. Today our hike went thru Grayson Highlands, famous for wild ponies that greet you on the trail. We decided to take a blue Blaze side trail because the comments said we'd see ponies and the views were spectacular.  Well, it clouded up so no views. The fog rolled in and though we could hear an occasional  whinney, no ponies. Probably the first thru hikers ever that didn't experience the ponies,  they'll be talking about us for years. We still had a great day and made good time arriving at Hurricane Mountain Shelter by 4pm.  We got set up and with heavy rain in the forecast for the night, we were soon full up, then made room for 2 more.  
The forecast was calling for heavy rain  all day tomorrow. We planned to stay in the shelter and if needed, hang out all day tomorrow to stay out of the rain. It was a good crowd in the shelter with everyone making room and taking turns eating at the covered picnic table. George was there in his plaid kilt. Runt and Ken (brother and sister) were there. Nanna Man was all dressed up in bright yellow hiking gear. Ended up with about 9 of us in the newer well built shelter.
It rained hard all night and made for a great night's sleep. The rain hitting the metal roof was a soothing pitter patter that drowned out what little snoring there was. This was home for the night.

Everyone was up and packing early. The forecast for today changed and the rain was going to bypass us till late afternoon.  We decided to move on and see how far we could get and set up our tents if it looked like rain. We called a shuttle driver to meet us at Dickey Gap to take us to a Dollar General to resupply. 
When we arrived at the Gap we had a snack and waited for Cole, our ride to the store. We didn't have cell service and couldn't contact him. When a car pulled up to pick up some other hikers, we asked the female driver if she knew Cole which she replied. ""Yes I do, he's my ex husband."" Once we stopped laughing she said she'd call him when she got back to cell service and let him know we were there.
After resupply and having an awesome deli sandwich we were back on trail in the light rain. Found a great tent site and set up quickly before any heavy rain. Tonight will be a good night to fall asleep to a movie Grinch downloaded on her phone. 36.7 miles over three days.","Laurel Creek Bridge

Grinch had replacement shoes shipped to an outfitter there and we can eat town food and resupply.  Partnership Shelter is a large shelter that's popular with hikers because you can have pizza delivered.  Rumor had it that there was going to be a large crowd there and spaces would fill up fast. Add to that the forecast for rain all night and we figured we needed to hike fast and secure a spot.
Very few breaks and a fast pace got us all there in time for a comfy corner in the loft of the 2 story shelter. By the time we set up it was filled with 30 hikers, all glad that they won the shelter spot lottery. Dang Bird talked someone into picking us up some beer and we had a pizza delivery. Again, hiker heaven. It was a giant pizza party.
We were glad to be out of the rain tonight and in our quilts in the loft but put 30 hikers that haven't showered in a week in such a close quarters and the smell is pretty bad. Can't wait till morning and fresh air.","Tent site mile 521.5

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663197,"Everyone was packing up in the shelter at 7:00 am. 30 hikers all moving around and stuffing their packs and a line at the privy.  I think we'll wait it out a bit in our warm quilts. We plan on hitching a ride into Marion and taking a zero day. This will be the last time to get a good resupply for the next 70 miles on the trail and for sure the last real town food.
No cell service at the Partnership shelter outside of Marion  VA. 
In the morning grinch walked down to the visitor center to use the hiker phone to get us a shuttle to town.  A storm had rolled through overnight so the phone wasn't working.  Busy signal, you must first dial the area code, the number you are calling is no longer in service….grinch kept at it for 30 minutes or so to no avail.  As she picked up the phone to try again she heard a loud ""yooooo hoooo!!"" From the parking lot.  a local lady was driving through  to see if anyone needed a ride to town.  Grinch couldn't believe  it!   She explained that our group of 3 had to pack up yet.  The driver said she had a full mug of coffee  and to take our time and she'd wait.  Grinch double timed it back to the shelter and we stuffed our packs and got out to the parking lot in 15 minutes.
Carrie's son had hiked the AT a few years back and she's been helping hikers ever since.  She drove us around, showed us where the outfitters were and when we found out the hostel was full she drove us to a recommended motel whose hiker rate was cheaper than the hostel.  Then she offered to pick us up in the morning and go through the same process again. Now that's trail magic. We've learned not to turn those offers down.  We tried to give Mrs. Sparks some gas money. But she refused.
We ate Chinese buffet for an early dinner and resupplied at Ingles grocery and Walmart for a 5 night 6 day hike this week. After well needed showers and a 2nd dinner pizza delivery it was time to call it for the night. 
Marion has been an amazing hiker friendly hiker town. Locals have gone out of their way to chat, ask questions, and offer help. Sitting on a bench after the buffet, a young man taking a break from Little Caesars was asking questions about our hike and telling us about his interactions with other hikers. He offered to buy us a pizza which we would have loved but had just filled up on 2nds and thirds at the buffet.  He was great to talk to and has his first baby on the way.
Two different men at the grocery store stopped us to chat and ask about our hike. One offered a ride if we needed. Amazing people and an amazing town. I'm sure we stick out as thru hikers by our gear and long beards and the hiker type food in our cart.","Partnership Shelter

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663198,"Got picked up at the motel in Marion and dropped off in town to pick up Grinches shoes at the outfitter. Grabbed some dehydrated meals and electrolytes and headed to 3 sisters Cafe for lunch. The town has a free bus which we hopped back to Partnership Shelter at the trail. It was already 3:00 pm so we decided to stay there for the night. Picky Eater packed out a package of jalapeño hot dogs and buns and we had a fabulous dinner.
Tuesday morning we hit the trail. Sunny, but a bit Chilly made for good hiking weather. We had 2 pretty good climbs in the first part of the day and then fairly level trail the rest of the day ( nothing like the Smokies). So far in Southern Virginia there aren't sweeping mountain views but it is pretty.  
We came across a 19th century farm that has been restored and we're able to hang out in the front porch swing for lunch. No one else around except a gaggle of chickens. We checked out the barns and it was like being back at the farm in Northern Michigan. 
We found a great campsite about 13 miles into the day to set up our tents. There was an awesome spring a short walk down a side trail to fill up with water. Had dinner and called it a night.
We left Marion this morning with 6 days worth of food so our packs were on the heavy side. We actually could probably go more than a week without resupply. Can't wait till we go thru it and our packs get lighter.","Marion

11.1 miles Possum Creek pavilion 
We waited out freezing rain until 10 am.  By then it had changed to sleet and 30 mph winds.  It was time to go.
 There was another hiker there last night, Skippy from New Zealand who was very animated in her storytelling.  She acted out the story of taking a picture of a bear. She played the part of the bear.  And then herself. She had us all rolling with laughter. 
She made fun of the fact that everyone on the trail thinks she's from Australia.  Apparently there's a thing between Australians and New Zealanders because she said she didn't trust them. She was gone early in the morning. 
Lots of ups and downs and switchbacks today but nothing too steep. There were quite a few cattle crossing ladders as the trail rolled through farm lands.
 We sure like the switchbacks rather than going straight up or down, easier on the knees.  Of course  there are other hikers that hate swtch backs.  No middle ground  on that one.
We found a community Pavillion in the middle of nowhere on Possum Creek that had power outlets, a nice flat Grassy area and an outhouse.  The sign said no camping but it was such a perfect area we would just assume that sign was meant for other hikers. A section hiker  from Pennsylvania showed up so we figured we could just blame our lawlessness on him. 
We were able to eat at the picnic tables and charge our phones. If not for the whippoorwill crowing half the night it would have been a perfect night for Dang Bird too.  He kept muttering at the dang whipoorwill.

11.3 Chestnut Knob Shelter
We managed to make it thru the night without getting arrested.  Sunny morning but windy and 40. It warmed up fast though and the first half of the day was fairly easy hiking.  Our app stated that the bridge was out over Lick creek and to find an alternate route if high water. It hadn't rained in a couple days so we took our chance that it was going to be passable.  
When we got to the river crossing it was a relief to see that it was only 8 inches deep. We decided to have lunch before crossing and had fun seeing the look on other arriving hikers faces when we told them it was chest deep. After taking off our shoes and crossing, we set our sites on Chestnut Knob shelter. The shelter is an old fire wardens cabin with a beautiful Grassy area overlooking Burkes Garden, a scenic farm area with mountains for a backdrop.  Most of the 6 miles to get there was uphill but well worth it. We set up our tents overlooking the view. Later in the evening more hikers showed up and there were about 6 tents set up. 
While everyone was packing up 3 young Amish men came into camp and chatted with the hikers.  Two of them came all the way from Michigan for a wedding the day before.  
We made it down the mountain and were heading up the next climb when we found trail magic of a dozen fresh hard boiled eggs.  Picky Eater warned grinch and Dang Bird……DON'T EAT THESE EGGS.
Poor trinity.  We saw her later.  She ate the eggs along with a few other people.  They all got sick.
2 miles from the shelter we were all hiking close together chatting and looking forward to cooking dinner and relaxing.   All of the sudden grinch was tumbling downhill.  It happened just that fast.  She'd rolled both her ankles and came to a stop by the Boulder seemingly left there to catch runaway hikers.
The last two miles were slow going.  Picky Eater and Dang Bird backed off and let grinch do her thing.  She can be scary sometimes.

10.7 Jenkins Shelter
We woke up at 6am so we could have coffee in the tent and watch the morning sunrise over the valley below. It did not disappoint and we had another cup before packing up and gave grinch as much coffee as she wanted.  Most of the hikers moved on early, and everything  was quiet and peaceful.  
We expected yesterday's hike to be an easy flat ridge walk because Picky Eater looked at the app the night before and said so. It turned out to be a difficult up and down rocky day but we still managed to make it over 10 miles to Jenkins Shelter.    The last two were toughest on grinch but we were all quiet.
5-6 
4.5 Laurel Creek
We set off and it was quickly evident that grinch's ribs were a bigger issue.  She  hiked 3.5 miles through climbs and descents until Picky Eater took her pack for the last mile to give her a break.  Grinch can be stubborn at times.
We had made arrangements for a shuttle from Miss Julie to Weary Feet hostel in Bland.  Picky Eater and Dang Bird would catch up in a couple days.   
 We got to Laurel Creek, a wide waterfall with places to soak your feet or dunk into the deeper pools if it was warmer out.  Grinch contemplated soaking her bones.
Minutes later a car pulled up and a tall cowboy with spurs on his boots stepped out of the car and with a deep southern drawl and gravely voice hollered out; ""I'm here for The Grinch"".   The three amigos were split up for the first time.
Just past the creek was tenting areas that were flat and sheltered. There were 2 other hikers set up, one was Trinity that was recuperating from eating boiled eggs she found at the earlier crossing left by someone for hikers. Picky Eater is traumatized by the fact that someone would actually think that's OK to eat.
It was a nice warm day today. We are enjoying the warmer weather but know the real hot days of summer are coming. Thinking back on those 18 degree nights in the smokies,  this is pretty good. 
We got a late-night text from Grinch showing us a mountainous plate of meatloaf, mashed potatoes and gravy, and a huge garden salad.  It hurt a little to see that but Picky Eater and Dang Bird were mostly happy she was being taken care of by one of the nicest ladies you'll  ever meet.

15.7 Tent site mile 600.6
Hikers kept coming in throughout the evening and by 8pm there were about 15 tents set up. We're in the middle of the hiker bubble now. Moving forward, we'll probably pick stealth campsites away from the shelters more often until the younger, faster hikers pass thru. 
We decided to get up at 4am and hit the trail early. It was going to rain later today and we were thinking it would be good to get some miles in before it rained. Also, there was an outpost 8 miles up the trail that had breakfast and if they were open on Sundays we wanted to be there in time. Picky Eater was in charge of setting an alarm for 4:00 and when he went over to Dangbirds tent to wake him in the dark there were 3 tents, all blue Zpacks that were identical.  He whispered quietly to try and wake him up not knowing which tent was the right one. No luck. It wasn't until a half our later when he got bold enough to yell out and hear an answer back. Dang Bird led this morning and he must have been hungry because we got to the outpost by 9:00. To our disappointment,  it was closed. On to plan B. We hitched a ride with trail angel Chuck to the tiny town of Bland where there was a Dollar General for a small resupply of snacks.
For $10, Chuck picked us up in what could only be described as a beater. He was quite a character,  filling us in on government conspiracy theories which had us laughing the whole trip. He said his wife had to rescue him yesterday when he had a flat tire, so we were glad the beater held together this time. 
We were back on the trail by 10:30 and made good time. The trail was pretty good but still a lot of upsides and downs.  We passed the 600 mile mark today, a little underwhelming as it was raining pretty good. We found a good campsite about 15.7 miles into the day that only had room for a few tents so it was going to be a quiet night.  Just after setting up, a couple from Alaska pulled up in a pickup and asked if we wanted a beer. Uh ya! They gave us each a couple of Alaskan Amber's each. It's turning into a fine evening. Only 9 miles tomorrow and we'll reach Weary Feet hostel for a well needed day off with showers and real food.","Marion

We had 9.3 miles to go till we reached a side trail that led to Weary Feet Hostel where Grinch was waiting for us. Of course our day started with an early mile and a half climb straight up but the rest of the day was easier hiking. There wasn't much for water sources on this section but we did find a tiny pool of water fed by a small spring. There were mosquitoes in it but our filters made it drinkable and it actually tasted pretty good.  It's not funny, but funny it was   It was our first day hiking without grinch.  We all take turns being the pace car, but grinch also says;.  Hey it's time for a snack.  Or hey, let's find a place to eat lunch. Without her, picky Eater and Dang Bird were left to themselves.  Dang Bird led. And was thinking, ""why is he right on my heels and chasing me, I want a break."".
Picky Eater was running behind thinking; ""why is he running from me, I want to take a break "".
Not sure if it was last night's trail magic beers, the good night's sleep or just knowing we were going to have tomorrow off but we cruised thru the hike with just a few breaks and made it to Weary Feet hostel by 2:00 pm where Grinch was waiting by the road. It had been a week on the trail without real food or showers so we were all more than ready for a rest.
Grinch handed Dang Bird and Picky Eater each a beer that some hikers getting off trail left for us and we sat on the front porch catching up on the last 2 days apart. Weary Feet hostel is an older restored farmhouse with a beautiful setting and a creek running below.  We are going to set up tents in the field for 2 nights but get to use all the amenities and they cook breakfast and lunch each day. More like a bed and breakfast than a hostel.
More hikers showed up as the evening approached, about a dozen sat in for our dinner of pork roast, green beans,  potatoes, rolls and cake. $12 each got you the meal and great conversation with hikers from all over. Pork Chop was hiking by himself. There were 2 ladies starting their hike again after 5 weeks recuperating.  A Mom and sun from Argentina. Another couple was section hiking the entire trail and said they planned on completing it in 20 years. Everyone enjoying the conversation and laughing. We all had seconds.
Hit the tents by 8:30 and we watched a movie before falling asleep.  It was good to all be back together again and have tomorrow to relax on our minds.","Tent site 600.6

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663543,"Zero Day at Weary Feet Hostel in Bland, VA. Woke up this morning thinking how unreal it felt that we were sleeping in a tent basically in a back yard somewhere in Virginia. We had a good rest day yesterday. The hostel made breakfast and dinner and we took advantage of the all you can eat spread. There were a couple dozen hikers here and everyone seemed content with the progress they've made on the trail so far.  Frozen Belt showed up.  We haven't  seen him since before the Smokies.  He got off trail for his granddaughter 's first birthday.  He's back on trail.
We filled a box with gear to send home. The forecast looks like warm weather is here to stay so we're ditching some clothing, gloves and one of the 10 degree quilts. That should lighten the packs a bit more. 
Grinch is feeling much better and is going to take a couple more days to heal up and meet us in Pearisburg, about 25 trail miles away. There's an outfitter and a Walmart there for resupply.  We all have been craving a good ribeye steak so we set a goal to find a good restaurant up the trail in the next week or so.
 McAfee knob, a famous rock outcrop that is the most photographed point on the AT  is coming up in the next week.  It is such a popular  spot that thru hikers traverse the climb before sunrise to beat the throngs of tourists.  Then on to the Shenandoahs.

We left Weary Feet Hostel Around 10am after a well needed rest day. We were able to resupply there with some dehydrated meals and various snacks that wouldn't be good for you in real life. But for now we need all the calories available.  It was nice having a couple real dinners and breakfast at the hostel.  Julie, Meghan and the cowboy(Robert)  keep everyone fed and happy during their  stay.  It's a great place.  Grinch stayed behind to heal up.   She's in the best hands!
Shortly after getting on the trail we crossed a river on the Kimberling suspension bridge. They say the river goes through lots of farmland and the waters are not good for drinking. 
About 3 miles in we took a blue Blaze trail to Dismal Falls. Not a real high waterfall. More of a spread out rocky area with lots of water flowing into a deep swimming holes for summertime.  And we had it all to ourselves.
About 11 miles in we found a great campsite up on a ridge with great views. The only downside was we had to carry 6 liters of water each almost 2 miles so we could make dinner and have water for tomorrow.  The next water would be 8 miles up the trail.

15.5 miles Angel's Rest Hostel
We got on the trail by 8:30. The plan was to go about 13 miles and camp a couple miles outside of Pearisburg,  VA. Then we would meet back up with Grinch, hitch a ride to an outfitter and to Walmart. We found out we could get a free ride to a hostel in Pearisburg and tent there for $12 and that there was a Mexican restaurant across the street. So we added 2 and a half miles to the day, got our ride. Set up our tents and were sitting at the Mexican restaurant with our margaritas by 6pm. See, all we needed was motivation.

We took our showers and packed up right before Grinch arrived at the hostel at 10am. She got a hiker shuttle from Cowboy at Weary Feet hostel where she was healing up from her fall. We still had to get out to Walmart and the outfitters for resupply and it was going to be a hotter day than we are used to so we had a quick vote and decided to stay another night. It was only another $12 to tent and the senior discount they gave Picky Eater sealed the deal. Guess 55 and older is considered senior in VA.
Got a $6 ride out to resupply and picked up some jalapeño cheese dogs for a healthy dinner. We did put green onions on them. 
Our resupply was for 6 nights so we had half packed up for a food drop 3 days down the trail. The next grocery store was over 70 miles away and we didn't want to carry that much food all at once. We had a few left over beers so they went into the food drop too.

We were awoken at 6am by the town's volunteer fire department siren going off. Just so happens that the fire department is right behind the tent area, lucky us. I guess it was good because we had coffee and were headed to the trail at 8:00. It was a warm night and although it rained on and off between sunny skies and 75 degrees.  Each time it rained it was a welcome cool down.
Other than a few beautiful valley views, today's hike was mostly in a green tunnel of trees. It's certainly spring because we're now seeing flowers, bugs and lots of green.
Our destination today was a campsite 9.5 miles down the trail that had a spring for water nearby.  This was important because the next water for tomorrow is 10 miles down the trail.  We didn't see any other hikers on the  trail but after we were set up and were in our tents another 6 hikers came in.  Everyone  was happy to have water and a flat spot to tent.  It was a great day!","Weary Feet hostel

It didn't last long so we assumed he woke himself up. He apologized at morning coffee but we reassured him it wasn't the first time it's happened on the trail. If he was a thru hiker we could have come up with some good trail names for him though.  In the smokies there was a hiker dog that was trained to wake PTSD sufferers from their nightmares.   More than once he would run across our sleeping pads and wake whomever was having a nightmare.  We all thought that was pretty cool.  
We hit the trail at 9:30. Overcast morning and perfect hiking temperature and one of the easiest sections to hike to date. We flip flopped back and forth with other through hikers throughout the day and settled on a great camping spot next to a creek with small waterfalls for the night. That should make for a great night's sleep. There's also a couple 4 ft swimming holes that would be great on a 90 degree day. 
Picky Eater, Grinch and Dangbird sat at the firepit eating our dinners and chatting. One of the best parts of our hiking is being able to enjoy each other's company at the end of the day, especially as the weather has been warming up. 
Our tents are about 10ft from the trail so we can hear the occasional late hiker stomping by. They're probably wishing they got to these waterfront sites first.

The hardest part was the socks and underwear. 
The rain stopped long enough for us to pack up the tent and gear and get headed down the trail. The hike started out with a 3 mile steep climb to the top of Kelly Knob. Pretty much had to lean forward and creep up to the top. Then as we're accustomed to on the trail we began a steep descent. The rest of the day was a much better trail that included a hundred yard section of soupy mud. Our shoes and socks were already wet from yesterday so no big deal.
We had a food drop scheduled for 2pm at Rout 42 crossing. Our supplies were running low and this would get us another couple days down the trail. We were running behind so Picky Eater decided to go ahead and see if he could get there in time. He made it with 5 minutes to spare but the resupply shuttle didn't show up for another hour. 
We decided to camp just past the drop off point about 8.5 miles into the day. Shorter than we'd like but a nice rest from yesterday's rain. Today ended up only raining on and off a few times and the sky's cleared long enough to get setup and have our dinners. Supposed to be thunder showers tonight.

We passed over a large area of ledges that were at a 45 degree angle with drop offs at the end. For a mile we really had to concentrate on every step. This would have been even harder if it had been raining. It really slowed us down but we took our time.
Our goal today was to get past Dragons Tooth, the first stop of completing VA tripple crown. The climb up was tough after 12 miles of hiking but nothing like the steep climb down. Boulder hopping on giant boulders and ridges, sometimes sliding down to the next boulder. Normally,  this distance would have taken an hour but it was more like 3.

Tomorrow we will head 9.2 miles to Daleville, VA and take a day off to shower, eat and resupply.  We've been discussing our food cravings the last few days and it looks like ribeye steaks on the grill before we leave town. And then maybe another dinner later in the evening.  Hiker hunger is in full swing.  We are in great spirits.","Catawba Mtn shelter

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664429,"We fell asleep early last night in our tent just north of Lambert Mtn Shelter.  It was still light out. Our tent was set up near the metal Bear box where hikers store their food bags for the night. Picky Eater was awakened before dark by a noise and peaked under the tent vestibule to see the head of a bear staring at him from next to the bear box. Still groggy he started yelling out GET! GET! . The bear just looked at him confused and then a hiker stood up from putting his bear bag in the box. Picky Eater apologized for yelling at his dog that looked like a bear and we all went back to sleep.
We started our hike into Daleville about 9:00, a Fairly easy day. We were excited to have a full day off tomorrow and planned to pick up some ribeye steaks for the grill. We passed a park ranger on the way who told us about a camping closure about 30 miles up the trail. A couple of section hikers had a bear come up to them at one of the shelters and it boldly grabbed one of their backpacks and ran off with it. The two ladies got scared and hi-tailed it down the trail. So they closed a 10 mile radius to camping but we can still hike thru.
About a half mile before reaching town we came across a smaller bear that kept its distance but watched us from the woods. We let other hikers know about it and moved on. Our first stop was Wendy's for first dinner burgers. Our second stop was a Super 8 to check into our room for the night. Our 3rd stop was the Mexican restaurant out front for 2nd dinner.
Tomorrow we'll resupply our food bags, hit the outfitters and move to a hostel for the night. It felt good to eat real food and have a relaxing night.","Lambert Mtn Shelter

We headed out for a half mile walk to the outfitters for freeze dried meals then to Kroger to finish our resupply.  We bought ribeyes, potatoes and coleslaw for grilling out tonight and headed to the hostel, a mile walk thru the woods. Our packs were full so Pickey Eater hung the steaks from the back of his. 
We arrived at the hostel about 3pm and as we were checking in, another hiker told us about a bear he had just seen in the woods we had just walked through.  We've been dreaming of Ribeye steaks for so long it would have to be a pretty determined bear to wrestle them away from us so close to meal time.
The hostel provided us with a charcoal grill and a bucket of ice to make some drinks and after setting up our tents we sat down to our best meal on the trail to date. The weather warmed up and it was a nice sunny evening.","Daleville, VA

Shortly after heading down the trail we passed the ⅓ of the way to Katahdin marker. We're getting in more miles everyday and not taking all the cold weather zero days so the next third will come along much faster. We found a nice camping area near Wilson Creek. A shelter was just a half mile more up the trail but we opted to have our quiet area by the creek for tonight.  We were right off the trail so about a half dozen hikers passed thru during the evening.  It's relaxing falling asleep to the sound of flowing water.","Daleville, VA

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664517,"Woke up Early and got going up the trail by 7:30. We found out that if we only take 2 packets of instant coffee into the tent it's easier to get an early start. This will take some getting used to though. We all felt rested this morning so planning on a longer hiking day.
We stopped at the first shelter for a quick break and a snack. The AT crossed the Blue ridge Parkway about 3 miles ahead and crisscrossed for about 8 miles. We decided to walk the parkway because it was wide open mountain views the whole way. A perfect sunny day. The car pull outs on the parkway had picnic tables so we stopped and had our lunch in a shady spot. There wasn't much traffic so it was really nice. We'd like to come back one day with our motorcycles. 
Once we got back on the trail we decided to make it a 17.5 mile day and spend the night at Middle Creek Campground.  They have a $10 hiker rate and we could get hamburgers there. They would also pick us up from the trail for free. Last call for burgers was 6:15 so we had to high tail it to the pickup point still 5 miles away. We had cell service at the top of a ridge walk before the last 3 mile descent so Grinch called in our burger orders and we made it just in time to enjoy dinner and a beer on the deck before closing time. There were about a dozen other hikers there when we arrived.  
We were given a tent site with water and electric so we were able to charge our phones.  It was a great little place.","Wilson Creek tentsite

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664518,"We were able to resupply with some snacks at the Campground but really didn't need much as we already had enough food to get us to our next town. 
We had a couple pretty good climbs coming up for the day and the lighter our packs were the better.
There was a camping closure 15 miles up the trail because of a problem bear so we decided to camp well before that area so we didn't have to deal with it. The trail itself has been good. Not a lot of rocky areas but there was a couple mile and a half climbs. The trees are full with leaves now so we're only getting the occasional mountain view. We've been checking around logs and rocks before sitting for a break to make sure of no snake surprises. 
We arrived at Cornelius Creek Shelter about 3pm. A fairly easy day but we were all ready to be finished for the night. There were quite a few campsites, most of them pretty sloped. It makes for a long night when you keep sliding down your sleeping pad because the ground is uneven so we put our backpacks down by our feet to keep us in place.
Because of the recent bear activity, we've been taking Xtra care to hang our food bags high up on a tree limb. Always happy to see it still hanging in the morning.

A few climbs right away this morning.  We're still pretty much in the green tunnel of leaves and the temperature is in the 60s so it makes for good hiking. We are pretty good on food resupply and Glasgow,  VA is 20 miles up trail so the plan is to stock up good for a 6 day stretch into Waynesboro. 
Hikers have been telling us they've been seeing a larger black bear between us and Glasgow hanging near the shelter and doesn't run off when hikers show up. Neither of us is up to do 20 miles today so we got hold of a shuttle to pick us up where the trail crosses the Blue Ridge Parkway.  It was going to be a bit before he could get there so we laid back on our packs and napped in the sun on the side if the road.
Our shuttle driver was quite the character, every sentence he spoke ending with a punchline. He was in the navy for 6 years and most recently ran the local hostel in town. The parkway, although beautiful,  twists and turns all the way down to Glasgow and he made sure we had that soothing roller coaster feeling. It didn't take long to get to town. 
Glasgow is a hiker friendly town. There is a shelter that was set up for Appalachian Trail thru hikers right in town that has a large tenting area, a fire pit, hot outdoor shower and power outlets, all for free.  There's a pizza restaurant and grocery store but not much else. We ate dinner as soon as we got to town and set up our tents. After resupplying our food bags it was time to order pizza for a second dinner.

Can usual hear Dangbird moving in his tent sometime around the second cup. The shelter area we stayed at in Glaskow was a pretty nice place to rest last night. We sat at the picnic table and decided to take a zero day today. We had a 70+ mile stretch coming up and thought it would be good to have fresh legs since we'd be carrying a lot of food. Another town dinner sounded good too.
Irish and another hiker from Canada showed up in the afternoon. We met him a few hundred miles ago at a hostel in Irwin, TN. We remembered he liked bluegrass music and he helped Picky Eater pick out some songs for his Playlist. A few other hikers showed up, one had hiked all the way from the Pinhoti trail in Alabama and was going to hike the Pacific Crest trail this year too. We sat around the fire telling trail stories.
We scheduled a ride back to the trail for morning. It looks like rain for the next 2 days but we're all well rested and ready. The next town will be Waynesboro,  VA,  about 5 or 6 days away.","Glasgow, VA

The bear was foaming at the mouth and face to face with him snapping its jaws. Luckily the alarm on the phone went off and woke us up, it was 6am and time for coffee before the day's hike.
We had a ride back to the trail scheduled for 9:00 so we were able to take our time packing up. It was supposed to rain during the day so we knew the chance of getting pretty wet was good. Made sure our quilts and clothing were packed into the dry bags, we learned that lesson early on.
The trail started with a 3.5 mile steep climb. We made good time and the rain held off until about 2:00. When it started raining, we still had 5 miles to get to Punchbowl Shelter.  When we arrived there were 2 hikers there already, with a fire started.

No one was in a hurry to pack up, everyone checking the weather forecast for the day. By 9am we decided to hang out in the shelter instead of hiking in rain all day. Most of the other hikers came to the same decision.
A younger section hiker had to hike to her car that was parked at a trail crossing a mile down trail.  Two thru hikers, one an army drill Sargent, the other a new retiree offered to get her to her car in exchange for a ride to town. An offer she gladly accepted.
The three of them returned a short time later as the young section hiker realized this wasn't the trail head where her car was parked.  She was able to get in touch with the hostel that helped stage her car for her hike.  It was actually 10 miles further up the trail.  They set out a second time to meet the shuttle driver to take her to her car.
This was her first hiking experience  and she was in over her head.
 We all awoke from afternoon naps in the shelter when the guys showed back up with 5 pizzas and beer for everyone. The drill Sargent  even packed in a bag of firewood. Man are we glad we stuck around.  Roaring fire, pizza and great conversation.  Thank you Homemade and GI Joe for the Memorial  Day Celebration.  We celebrated  with Irish, Slo Moe, Spider work, Homemade, GI Joe, and Dang Bird.
Quite a few hikers stopped by the shelter during the day on their way down the trail. They were all soaked from head to toe but all in good spirits. By early evening the rain stopped and sun came out. It's looking good for tomorrow.

We had coffee at the picnic table and chatted with everyone as they left one by one. We had an easier hike ahead for the day and everything except our shoes was dry. 
We passed a few section hikers and flip flopped with Dory, a Mom out doing a 400 mile section hike by herself. No mountain views today. Just a green tunnel for almost 10 miles. We passed over two suspension bridges before arriving at Brown Mountain Creek shelter. There is a creek just below the shelter with some nice level tent sites that we'll call home for the night. 
We ate our dinners up at the shelter picnic table and chatted with Dory about her plans to hike the whole AT with her 18 yr old son next year. Dang Bird got a little fire going. With the wet wood it was more smoke than fire, but it did smell good. By 8pm, no other hikers showed up so it may be a pleasant,  quiet night with only the fast moving water in the creek to lull us to sleep.
We decided to get going a little earlier tomorrow.  Grinch says that with all the zero days we've taken this week it feels like Virginia is for loafers.  It'll be 5 more days before we get another day to rest.
It's been quite an adventure so far and we were reflecting on everything we've been through on the trail. All the characters from all walks of life out here with the same daily goal to get from one camp to the next. 18 degree nights and waking up to frozen shoes. 12 mile mountain climbs in the Smokies.

The weather finally broke and it's sunny and warm again. The hostel is pretty busy. A clean place and we were able to set up our tents out front. There's an all you can eat chinese buffet, a neighborhood Walmart and dollar stores for resupply.
We've been concerned for a couple weeks that Grinch may have picked up Lyme disease from a tick we removed under her eye a month earlier. She's feeling OK but some of the tell tale symptoms have been getting worse and the smart thing to do is get checked out by her doctor.  So as tough a decision as it was, Grinch will be getting off trail and Picky Eater will continue on with Dang Bird. We've planned this hike together for years, it's been the trip of a lifetime and both of us want it to continue.  Grinch will be providing logistical help and will very much still be sharing in the adventure.

No mountain views with the fog and low clouds but we plan to hike thru any of the turn offs anyway.our goal is to secure a free camping spot at the Loft Mountain Campground compliments of trail magic. We're hoping there will still be some when we get there.
It didn't start raining until we arrived at the Campground. There were actually two different trail magic setups going on. One was making hot dogs and had a couple awning tents set up. The other one had pizzas and about 19 coolers full of beer and refreshments. They also had camp spots for us. It was going to be nice to relax and not have to cook.

We will cross the 900 mile mark today.
We hiked a mile to the camp store just to check it out. Don't need any supplies though. The clerk gave us a free coffee and we hung out chatting while plugging our battery packs in for a quick charge. She hiked the whole trail in 2021 and had good stories.

We were closer to civilization most of the day so there were a lot of day hikers on the trail, most of them struggling up the steep rocky climbs. A few stopped us to ask about our thru hike and of course we made sure they new we passed 900 miles.
We kept a good pace until we hid the rocks near Mary's Rock overlook. Only a few miles to go so we took our time. There was smoke filling the valley views and someone Told us it was from wildfires in Canada blowing south. I'll have to look that up tonight as we haven't watched any news in a while.
When we got to the road crossing to Luray we started calling for a shuttle to town. I don't think they are as used to thru hikers because it's about 8 Miles away and not much for hikers there.

Today's cover photo shows the Smokey Valley views we've been getting from the Canadian wildfires this week.  Sometimes in the mornings it completely hides the mountains. 
Arrived at the shelter at 3:30. The shelter was nice with a big deck out front. The tenting areas were spread out and quite the Boulder hop to get to them. We found a couple spots that were rocky and uneven but they'll have to do.

Rocky most of the beginning but down hill and we arrived a half hour before the shuttle.  A couple hikers were trying to hitchhike but it didn't go too well so they ended up on the trolley with us.The trolley driver was a little cranky and told us to hurry. She must have been behind schedule because we were rocking side to side at every curve and we could hear her talking under her breath as she tailgated cars that weren't moving fast enough. We arrived to town in one piece and thanked her for the ride.
Front Royal is a pretty nice place. At least the downtown area where we were was. We resupplied the few items we needed at Dollar General and picked up some dehydrated meals at the outfitter.  Picky Eater got his new Merrill Moab shoes. Sad to see the old ones go but they had 1000 miles on them, no cushion left and smelt real bad. Don't think he'll wait so long next time.

We started out by eating a large breakfast at the pancake house and ended with pork tacos and a giant pretzel at the downtown brewery.  We decided after buy one get one beers that we would only go another 3 miles to Mosby Camp to tent for the night. The trolley got us back to the trail and after another good climb we were set up by 6:30pm. 
We may do a 20 mile day tomorrow.  It's supposed to be in the upper 80s though, so we'll see how it goes.","Tom Floyd Wayside shelter

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665327,"Another good night's sleep and waking up at 6am. Was already warming up before we packed up. We wanted to make sure we got going because it was gonna be one of the warmer days on the trail so far. We spent March and April dreaming of days like this and now we dream that it will be cooler out.
The first half of today's hike was a steady slow climb. It wouldn't have been too bad but there were rock hopping sections mixed in. That always slows us down. We passed several hikers and others passed us, usually as we took a break on the side of the trail. 
We stopped at Manassas Gap shelter to eat something, fill up our waters and take our shoes off for a bit. We'll do that more now that the weather is getting warmer. The shelter is log cabin style with a picnic table and benches to sit at. There were two other hikers there and Picky Eater asked if they minded if two smelly hikers joined them for lunch. They were thru hiking too so that made 4 smelly hikers for lunch.
We are fairly close to Washington DC  so there were quite a few day hiker groups on the trail today. Most didn't have water and most were struggling on the rock climbs in the heat of the day. One asked Dangbird and Picky Eater if they had any bug spray. Funny, but the mosquitoes don't bother us at all. Probably because we don't have the smell of perfume or deodorant or clean clothes on us.
The second half of the day was much easier.  Long slow climbs and descents. We were able o speed it up a little and made it to a tent site 18.6 miles into the hike. Tucked into the woods and right beside a stream. A section hiker from DC showd up just as we finished setting up. We all had our dinners and chatted about the trail.
Big day tomorrow.  Not sure how far we're going but we are going to pass the 1000 Mike mark about 6 Mike's into the day!","Mosby Camp

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665357,"Today we'll hit the Virginia Rollercoasters, a series of ups and downs for 14 miles that starts 2 miles up the trail. A couple hikers we've talked to said it's not easy but not as bad as the hype. It's supposed to get in the 80s today so we're gonna shoot for a shorter day after yesterday's 18.6 miles. That will put us in Harper's Ferry on Tues instead of Monday.  
We hit the 1,000 mile mark about 6 miles into the day! There was a sign posted (Springer Mountain 1000 miles). We're well into the roller coasters that are tough but not as bad as we thought. All the hype prepared us so we were ready. There's a nice breeze so far which really helps since it's pushing 80 already. Lots of stream crossings so we've been filtering and drinking lots of water and propel. 
Flip flopped with several hikers today. Everyone was taking it slow. By the 5th climb up a mountain we decided to look for a camp spot. We're not too picky. It just needs to be flat, have water nearby and somewhere to sit. Found the perfect spot about 11 miles into the day. That'll do after yesterday's 18+ miles.
We filled our waters, set up our tents and relaxed while eating. Picky Eater had his typical meal of biscuits and gravy with bacon crumbles, a small bag of pretzel bite and some sugar donuts. Topped it off with a hot chocolate and mini bottle of Kahlua. 
Still have a little less than a third of the Roller Coasters to finish tomorrow. It's supposed to be thunder showers beginning around 7am till afternoon. Looks like we'll be wet. Hopefully that forcast changes.","Stealth site mile 994.1

Was hoping to put it in the packs while still dry. Been sleeping real good lately. Probably because we've increased our average miles and have figured out our food and are eating better. 
4 more climbs in store for the day and then it levels off after we finish the Rollercoasters. Just after our first climb we came up to a road crossing where some 2022 thru hikers were set up with trail magic. Picky Eater feasted on a couple donuts and sat in a real camp chair while chatting.  A good start to the day. 
We finished the Rollercoasters right at noon and it started raining almost immediately.  We were glad it held off till now when the climbs and descents were finished. We were still 15 miles from Harper's Ferry but it was mostly flat hiking ahead. Dangbird suggested we keep going since we were both feeling good and we were already wet anyway. 
It rained pretty hard the rest of the day. We didn't take any breaks because it was just warm enough that if we kept moving it was comfortable.  We were going to be staying in a hotel for a couple nights and there would be plenty time to dry out when we got to Harper's Ferry.  
About an hour before we got to town the rain stopped and sun came out. It warmed up fast but the trail was still a big mud puddle to hike thru. We arrived at 5:30 and were showered and in dry clothes by 6:30. Time to order a couple large pizzas delivered. 20.1 miles for the day. It felt good.

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665513,"Slept in till 7:00 and had coffee till 10:00. Taking a much needed day off. We needed to do laundry,  resupply and check in at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.  But in no hurry to start the day.
There were almost a dozen hikers staying in the hotel. Harper's Ferry, while not quite the half way point is kind of an emotional half way. The ATC has an office and visitor center here and we'll get our pictures taken for the record book. There is a lot of civil war history here and a few hours in town doesn't do it justice.  It's on the bucket list to come back through and walk all the historic buildings.
The hotel had laundry facilities thankfully so we were able to check that off the list. We headed to town, about a mile further up hill on the trail. The first stop was the ATC to check in. We had our official photos taken and filled in the info for the photo log book. Picky Eater was hiker number 658 to arrive in Harper's Ferry.  About 3000 +/- started the trail. Probably half have left the trail and more are behind, so we're feeling pretty good about it. Still a lot of trail ahead though. 
The next stop was the outfitters a few blocks away. We picked up some dehydrated meals, electrolytes and body glide.  They had lightweight 50deg sleeping bags that packed up real small so Picky Eater and Dangbird both bought one. We will send home our bulky 10 degree quilts and take some weight from our packs. When it gets colder again, Grinch will send our quilts back to us.
Walked the mile back to the hotel and started making plans for dinner.  Picky Eater has been dreaming of a steak for a couple weeks. The two nice steak houses in town were closed on Mondays and Tuesdays,  go figured.  We found a place 1.2 miles up the highway that had steaks. A nice New York Strip for Picky Eater was well worth a 2.4 mile round trip playing frogger on the busy road. It really wasn't that bad of a walk and it was delicious.","Harper's Ferry

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665521,"Stopped at the post office on our walk to the trail to mail home the last of our cold weather gear. It's gonna be nice having our pack weight down even more. It also looks like we go thru resupply towns more often so no need to carry as much food. Down to just the bare essentials. Picky Eater eat his puffy jacket because it doesn't weigh much, it's nice for cooler mornings at camp and it doubles as a pillow at night.
One last walk through Harper's Ferry and a stop at a Cafe to eat a late morning cheeseburger. It sprinkled a little but didn't last long and the sun came out.
The trail went over a railrod bridge crossing the Potomac river heading out of town and the first 3 miles was flat pathway along an old barge canal. We're in Maryland now and it's supposed to be the easiest part of the trail. In 40 miles we enter Pennsylvania. 
Even though it was almost noon when leaving town we still managed to get in 11.4 miles to Crampton Gap shelter.  There was a nice separate tenting area and each site had a bench to cook at. There was only one other hiker there. Could tell it wasn't a thru hiker because he hung his food on the bear pole in a plastic garbage bag.

We decided to go for 20 miles today. The trail should be good and there's not a whole lot to see this section. Picky Eater led today and we started out pretty fast. We made 9 miles to the original Washington Memorial in 3 hours and took a long break to eat and check out the memorial, a stone structure with nice views. 
13 more miles to hit 20. We toyed with the idea of going farther but the trail turned rocky with some steaper bolder stair climbs that slowed things down. The rest of the day was uneventful and by the time we reached Ensign Cowal shelter at 20.7 miles we were pretty tired. We found a spring to get water,  made dinner and settled in our tents. Tomorrow we have about 13 miles to resupply in Waynesboro,  PA. There's a Walmart and we should be able to get a restaurant meal.","Crampton Gap Shelter

We made the executive decision to stay hunkered down in the tents and dry till they passed thru by 11:00. Time to put the coffee away and sneak a couple more hours sleep. Now that doesn't happen often. 
Woke up at 11:00. The rain was done and a slight breeze was drying off the tent. We weren't going to be doing another 20 miles today with the late start.  The plan was to go about 10 miles and set ourselves up to resupply in Waynesboro the next morning. 
Many hikers had been telling us that the trail would be flatter in Maryland.  The ATC lists it as the easiest state to hike thru on their hiker facts web page. Maryland is not long 3000 foot mountain climbs but there are steep sections and a good portion is boulder hopping. It's only 40ish miles though. 
After hiking about 7 miles we started to hear thunder rolling in. It was getting closer and looked like we were going to get dumped on. We were about 2.5 miles from Pen Mar Park where there were pavilions we could duck under so we picked up the pace. The trail smoothed out and we made it just in time. It rained hard for an hour while we made our dinners to pass time. Dodged the rain twice in one day.
When the rain stopped,  we moved on another mile to a campsite just over the Mason Dixon line and into Pennsylvania. Another state completed.  It was already 7:30 when we set up and almost hiker midnight.  Tomorrow is resupply day.","Ensign Cowall Shelter

Not even a Cracker. Perfect timing. But first stop was Applebee's for a ribeye steak. It was only noon but can't miss this opportunity. 
Walmart and dollar General were close by so resupply was easy. We picked up 4 days worth of food so back to a heavier pack to start the next section. We made arrangements for a ride back to the trail since it was all uphill and walked over to Kentucky Fried chicken to have another late lunch. Hiker hunger is in full bloom.

Today's hike looked pretty good on the map but there were some pretty good climbs and the ever present rocks and boulder hopping kept us looking at our footing. Our goal was to go at least 20 miles so we started off fast and only took a few breaks. At 10 miles in to the day we found a spot with flat boulders to take our shoes off and sit for a lunch break. Feeling pretty good about the longer mile day.
At just over 20 miles we filled up our waters, taking Xtra to cook meals and have some to start tomorrow.  With all the water and 4 days food, packs were heavy climbing up the last hill before camping at a site 21.2 miles into the day.

We only had 12 miles to go today so took our time packing up and headed out about 9:00. Close to 90 degrees today with no wind. Glad most of the trail was tucked into the green tunnel.  No mountain views.
At just over 1099 mile marker we reached to AT halfway point. Picky Eater was expecting a band and cheering crowds but we had to settle for ""½ way"" spelled out in sticks on the side of the trail. Kind of underwhelming for a feat of this magnitude.  We'll reach Pine Grove Furnace state park in 5 miles where hikers do the traditional 'half gallon' ice cream challenge. Picky Eater thinks he'll do the 1 ice cream sandwich challenge. 
When we arrived, there were 15 hikers sitting on the camp store deck shoving ice cream down and timing each other's progress. We ordered bacon cheeseburgers and chatted with local campers. A little disappointed they don't sell congratulate beer growlers here.
Most hikers moved on down the trail. We opted to get a site in the Campground so we could shower and charge our battery packs overnight. The Campground host gave us some shampoo, probably because we smelt so good.","Tent site mile 1093.2

We stop stopped at Green Mountain General Store about 8 miles down trail to grab a sports drink and ice cream. There were several other hikers there. We met Molly from Rhode Island who was doing a solo 50 mile section hike. She was headed near the same campsite as us so we all hiked together. Although we were expecting an easy finish to the day, it turned in to boulder climbing and steep ups and downs. Slow going but we madeit to camp by 7:15.
The only tree branch worthy of hanging our food bags was pretty high off the ground. It too about ten tries of Picky Eater and Dangbird throwing the rock bag in the air before finally reaching over the tree branch. Good thing we didn't have an audience.

We the increase in daily miles we need to eat well and often. 
The 4 miles to town went fast. Picky Eater had breakfast on his mind and other than one good climb, the trail was downhill the whole way. We were passed by a group of 15 school kids. Looked like they were out on a hike with their teachers.
We got to town by 10:30. Cafe 101 was still serving breakfast so we had a hearty meal. We stopped at the local outfitter but it was more of a fly fishing shop. Not much there we would need. Boiling Springs is a nice, clean and laid back town.
We hit the trail again about 12:15. The trail was a mixture of woods and rolling farm land. Probably the easiest hiking to date which made for a fast day. We leapfrogged with several hikers all day keeping a pretty good pace. Our goal was to do 26 miles but we settled on a tent site 22 miles in to the day. Water was scarce and if we went farther it would have meant hauling water for 4½ miles to the next tent site. Still,  we had our longest miles day of the trail so far.
Apparently, nude hiking day is a thing on summer solstice every year. Luckily,  Picky Eater and Dangbird didn't participate but we passed a couple hikers who did. Won't go into the details here.

We made it to town in about 3 hours. There was one decent climb early on then boulder hopping and a steep decline at the end. We found a little storefront called Kind of Outdoorsy that caters to thru hikers. They had a good selection of hiker food (a little pricey) and a hiker lounge with couches and a bathroom in the back. Hung out with hikers for a bit then headed to the Doyle hotel to grab a coffee and a burger. The bartender asked if we wanted our coffees spiced up with Irish whiskey. Sure!
We stopped at a convenience store for a few things, organized our food bags and recharged our battery packs before heading back down the trail. The rain had stopped so things dried out pretty fast. The first 2 miles was road walking out of town but when we got to the woods it was a steep boulder climb for another 2 miles and a steep boulder descent8 the rest of the way to camp. 
Pennsylvania hasn't been difficult, but with all the rocks and boulders you have to look at your feet the whole day so you don't bust an ankle. Add rain and it slows things down a bit more. We hear Northern PA is more rocky,  so got that to look forward to.

Passed a few hikers today. Everyone this far into the trail is doing about the same miles each day so there's not a lot of passing because it seems we're all doing the same pace. There were a few boulder ridge walks right off the bat. But also some smoother sections mixed in to give the feet a rest. 
About 10 miles in, along a beautiful ridge walk, Picky Eater came around a bend going a pretty good pace. Standing on the trail was a juvenile black bear about 10 feet away and staring face to face. Tapped the trekking poles together and told the bear to move on. Although it wasn't aggressive,  it had no plans to move any time soon. Finally, it turned around and headed into the woods with an attitude. A shelter was about a mile up the trail and this bear was probably getting used to people's food or trash from weekend hikers. 
Stopped at the shelter, made lunch and rested feet from rock hopping all morning. A couple other hikers came by. This was the last water source for a while, so everyone was topping off their bottles. We loaded up on 4 litres so that we'd also have water to cook with tonight.
With about 4 miles to go, we crossed over the Lehigh River and began a 1000 foot climb up Blue Mountain.  This section was more rock climbing than hiking and one of the most intense sections of the AT so far.

About 2 miles down the trail, someone had left 3 new gallon jugs of water for hikers. Thank-you trail Angels! Just after filling up with water, a group of day hikers called picky Eater over to their truck and asked if he was thru hiking. Asked if he needed anything like water or snacks. Uh, beer would be nice. So in a span of 5 minutes the trail provided. 
About halfway thru the day, crossing a trail parking lot, there was a large group of Chinese people set up with food for hikers. One of them had thru hiked in 2019 and they all come back for 1 week each year to provide trail magic. They were cooking fried rice to order and had sausages, cake, donuts, fruit and drinks. By far the most enthusiastic group we've seen so far. Picky Eater had to pass on the kimchi though.
The rest of the day was a fairly level but extremely rocky trail. Northern PA is living up to its reputation.  The last water source was 5 miles before our camp destination which meant once again carrying extra water. And as usual, the last couple miles was a steep 900 ft climb in elevation. 
We found a good camp spot a little over 17 miles into the day.  Picky Eater enjoyed the blue moon beer he received as trail magic this morning.  It must be the carbs he craves.
Tomorrow will be a 14 mile hike into Delaware Water Gap.  We'll resupply,  eat and stay the night. Hit the post office Monday morning before heading back onto the trail","Tent site mile 1265.4

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666352,"Great nite sleep. It rained pretty good but by morning it was already drying out. More rocks in store and the trail will eventually head straight down into Delaware Water Gap where we plan to stay the night tenting at a church hostel.
We had just enough water to get us to a spring 5 miles ahead. There was a mom with her 3 kids backpacking and they were packing up just as we arrived. Nice cold spring water.
Right after topping off our bottles we headed out for the last 9 miles of Pennsylvania.  Of course it started with a boulder hop and it was ending with a steep boulder hop. Add last night's rain and it made for a slow slippery descent. 
We passed a lot of day hikers in this stretch. It's close to a town and also a long holiday weekend. A few of them stopped us to ask about our thru hike. The last 2 miles was straight down into town. We were excited to have Pennsylvania finished. 
We found good tent sites at the hostel. There were probably 2 dozen hikers there but not all were thru hiking. Plugged our battery packs in to charge and headed out to eat, hit the outfitters and resupply.  Slim pickens on resupply as the only place in town was an overpriced Sunoko gas station. It'll have to do. 
We'll head to the post office 1st thing in the morning.  Picky Eater gets his long awaited chair!","Tent Site mile 1282.8

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666381,"Tenting area was comfortable,  but there was a motion light that kept going off all night. And it was bright. Got to the post office at 9am. Dangbird had a package and Picky Eater got his chair! It's perfect, comfortable and only weighs 1lb. Well worth the weight.
Took our time packing up. Dangbird had to go back to the outfitters and get a new sleeping pad. Before hitting the trail we stopped at a local shop and had BLTs and fries and then back to the Hostel for a 20 minute power nap.
It was close to 90deg as we started about noon. Going about 8 miles today. Of course there's a 3 mile, 1000 ft climb involved. 
We passed over the Delaware Water Gap Bridge. Halfway across we were now in New Jersey! 7 states done and 7 more to go. We also passed over 1300 miles today! Only 900 more.
The trail went around Sunfish pond, a beautiful lake that looked like would be nice for swimming.  I guess they call em ponds up here. About 1.5 miles past the pond, a stream crossed the trail that was perfect for filling up waters. We packed up xtrato take to our camp 1 mile more up the trail.
We found a great campsite right off trail about 8.5 miles into the day. Should see some nice sunset here tonight. Picky Eater sat in his wonderful ultralight camp chair while cooking/eating dinner.","Delaware Water Gap

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666563,"Made it all the way through New Jersey this week. Just now catching up on the journal.  We did longer days Wednesday and Thursday and it really felt like 20 miles a day was gonna be the norm. Then came the heat and humidity.  
We ended yesterday and today with stops at ice cream shops. It was humid and 90 degrees both days. A lot of the trail in the northern part of NJ came out into exposed rocky ridges where the sun was shining and hot. We've been pretty good on drinking water. There's been a lot of water caches at road crossings on this section of trail. Between that and the tannin colored streams, there's plenty. But drinking warm water gets old.
Today we passed the New York state line and out of NJ for good. That's 8 states done. We should make it through NY in a week. 
I'll try to keep up on the journal a little better this week.","Tent site mile 1360.4

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666644,"Another early start on the trail. The goal is to make it to Lake Tiorati where they have showers that hikers can use. 
New York is surprisingly beautiful but also very tough. Actually,  today was one of the toughest days on the trail. Not long ascents but grueling straight up and down rock climbs. A lot of them required putting the trekking poles away and pulling up by hand. Add to that the temperature close to 90 and humid.
One of the highlights of today was going thru the lemon squeezer. Just enough room to fit thru. Picky Eater was able to leave his pack on but most had to remove their packs to fit. One of the few times it's paid to be a picky Eater. There was a climb right after that required tossing packs upward and hand climbing. It's good to be in shape.
About 2 hours before reaching the lake, it started raining. Although it cooled things off, it made the boulders slippery which slowed us down. We passed a point where the New York City Skyline was in the distance but it was clouded in. Perhaps we'll be able to see it on our next thru hike.
Water crossings were scarce all day. Thankfully,  trail angels have been leaving gallons of water at road crossings. We've been drinking a litre every one to two hours and carrying extra just in case.
Picky Eater made it to the lake/showers about 2 hours before Dangbird.  The showers ended up being just 2 shower stalls in the bathroom with no curtains. Basically set up for swimmers to rinse off. So showered in shorts with everyone coming in staring like what's this homeless guy doing. At least the water was warm.
Set up at a picnic table to eat and wait on Dangbird.  When he arrived we found a stealth camping spot in the no camping area of the State Park. We planned to pack up early before anyone noticed.","Tent site mile 1375.8
",Tent site mile 1393.2,"Jul 08, Sat",17.30
Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666649,"It's gonna be hard to describe today in one journal post. I'm writing in my tent which is set up in the front lawn of the Holiday Inn Express in Fort Montgomery, NY. Dangbird is set up a few yards away.
We woke up early and were on the trail by 7am. Our plan was to go at least 17 miles. The trail goes up and over Bear Mountain and then right thru the Trailside Zoo just outside of Fort Montgomery where they have rehabilitated wildlife from the local area. Not sure why we need to see a captive bear as seeing them on the trail has almost been a daily occurrence. But hey, it'll be kind of cool since the trail was routed right thru (and it's free).
It was a little cooler out than the last couple days, but by 10am it was muggy and the trail once again was rugged. Going up and down large boulder climbs that rivaled anything we had in the Smokies. There was a blue Blaze reroute that bypassed a busy highway road crossing crossing but would have added a mile or 2 into the hike. We, like most AT hikers, opted to skip the Bypass. It was tricky because the old 3 mile section wasn't blazed very well and we had to use our GPS often to get back in the right direction. The road crossing wasn't that bad and we were glad for not taking the longer route.
We were getting low on food supply and Picky Eater had been thinking and dreaming of trail magic beer again. Most certainly because of the carb cravings. We ended up hiking with a few other hikers all going about the same pace. It was going to rain pretty good by 2:00 and we were hoping to get to the zoo before getting too wet.
About 11:30 we came down a steep descent and there it was, the world's best trail magic! A local couple had a table set up with Pizza, bagels, donuts and beer. There were chairs set up for hikers and we sat for about 45 minutes enjoying the finer things and chatting. But it was time to get going before the heavy rain started. Everyone moved on down the rocky trail and Picky Eater lagged a little behind after having seconds on the cheese pizza. He always catches up.
About 1:30 the rain started. We always put away our phones in a plastic baggie so it stays dry so it's hard to check in too often. The radar showed a pretty good storm building, so on with the rain jackets. When it's heavy rain they really don't keep you dry but do keep you warm. By 2:00 the rain was coming down by the bucket load as we were climbing up Bear Mountain (straight up) and a boulder climb. Sections required pulling yourself up over large boulders like a mountain climber. At least that's what it felt like. By the time we reached the top, there was no pulling out phones to check the radar.  Waterlogged fingers are useless on the touch screen anyway. About this time, an emergency alert was going off on picky Eaters phone.
The descent from Bear Mountain was straight down for 2.5 miles. There were stepping stones laid out the whole way so normally would have been an OK climb down but by now the rain was so hard it was extremely slow going. Already soaked, it didn't matter much if we were getting wetter. At least it was warm. It took over 2 hours to reach the zoo. Some of the hikers huddled down in the snake exhibit drying hands and finally using phones to make hotel arrangements.  It was slim pickens on finding rooms and like most hikers, after ⅔ of the trail done we've all blown our budgets and are trying to do things on the cheap. Bear Mountain lodge had rooms in the $300 range available but that wasn't happening.  
Rain coming down even harder now. We found a hotel room 12 miles away and texted around trying to find a ride. Finally, a shuttle driver responded but said it would be a while because the roads were flooded. We waited at the Bear Mountain lodge with about 2 dozen tourists, chatting and drinking free coffee.  After 2 hours the shuttle driver texted that the State troopers closed all the roads leading to us and turned him away. Everyone at the lodge was stuck there. 
The rain slowed down a bit so we decided to walk 1.5 miles to the highway where we though it would be easier to hitch a ride to our hotel. If we saw any hikers on the way we would offer a spot in our room. We passed some police along the way and they said all roads into and out of the area were flooded over and no one was going anywhere. And it was gonna rain hard again.
There was a young man in a pickup truck with a blown out tire on the side of the road. He just wanted to get home but his spare was rusted to the cable hoist underneath the truck bed and he didn't have tools. We were already wet and muddy, Picky Eater had a Leatherman, so we crawled underneath and worked on getting it down. We were able to get his spare put on and the police I'm sure were happy to have his truck moved because now they were routing traffic up to the lodge parking area which was already full. He would have given us a ride but no one was going anywhere. 
We did hitch a ride 2 miles to a Holiday Inn Express. They didn't have rooms but said we could hunker down in the lobby with the 50 other people that were there. At least we were out of the rain. Members of the Army basketball team were there and gave us sandwiches from a catered spread. All the restaurants were closed. We charged up our phones and put ourselves on a room waiting list knowing there was no chance of a room. We asked if we could set up our tents out front and they were fine with that. The front desk people were awesome, calmly taking care of everyone. They were moving cots into meeting rooms and were patient with everyone.  
We set up our tents and got inside, into dry clothes and warm for the night. It rained good for another 3 hours. 7 inches of rain in 3 hours. Bridges washed out, power in the area out. We'll try to get a room tomorrow and dry out and get a good meal or two or three.
Picky Eater and Dangbird were on the ozone with our wives throughout, assuring them we were fine.  Grinch was calling around working on logistics to help get a room for tomorrow.  The NY governor has declared a state of emergency so we'll have to see how this plays out in the morning","Tent site mile 1393.2

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666692,"Hard to get to sleep last night with the rain and adrenaline from the day. Stayed dry and warm in the tent though. By 8am the sun was shining and it was already heating up. We packed up our gear and tents and went back into the hotel lobby. There was a breakfast set up for guests. If sleeping in a tent in front of the hotel doesn't qualify you as a guest, what will? So we filled up on eggs and sausage. 
We were able to find a hotel room for tonight 2 miles up the road. Decided to take the day off and dry out our gear. As of now, the bridge to get back to the trail is closed and so is every other road leading out of town. We'll rest up today, catch up on sleep and worry about getting back to the trail tomorrow. 
About half way walking to the hotel the road was washed out from an overflowing stream. Workers were there with equipment to start repairing it and gave us weird looks as we climbed over the washout with our backpacks.  One of them said he wouldn't recommend going through.  Picky Eater said, mister. We've been hiking up and down mountains since February, we'll be fine.
We arrived at the hotel and checked in.  The hotel was clean enough, had hot water and a TV. All we needed. The parking lot was pretty much caved in and washed away from yesterday's flooding. Some of the lower rooms had been flooded but we were on the upper level. The laundry room had been flooded so we'll be washing our clothes in the sink today.
Found a Mexican restaurant just up the road and a small market to resupply.  The people we have come across in New York have been awesome.  People stopping for conversation, asking about the trail, wishing us well. The hotel desk folks yesterday went out of their way to help us even though we weren't staying there.
Late today it looks like the bridge over the Hudson River is open, so we may be able to cross over to the trail tomorrow.  We'll see.","Tent site Holiday Inn Fort Montgomery

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666730,"Took our time waking up. We still weren't sure if we were able to get to the trail today. All the roads leading back to the trailhead had washed out sections so they were closed to traffic.  We had 4 miles to get there so we headed out at 11:00 and started road walking. 
About 2 miles down the road we came across a deli and decided to get something to eat. There were several hikers there and one showed us a video from Sunday of the trail section they were on that turned into a torrential river. We had passed thru there two hours earlier when the heavy rain had just started. 
A little farther down the road, as we were coming up to a bridge that was closed, a local from West Point stopped us and gave directions to a side trail with a suspension bridge that would get us to the other side. It worked and we were able to make it to the Bear Mountain bridge where the Appalachian trail started again.  We were the only ones crossing, no cars.
The rest of the trail today, although washed out in sections, was easily passable. We made it to the Appalachian Deli right off the trail at 5:30 and had another meal. There were several hikers there telling stories about the rain storm and being out in the flooding.
A half mile past the deli was Graymoor Spiritual Life center. They have been letting hikers set up at the baseball field for years so we decided to head there for tonight. Nice level tent sites, water and a charging station.

Considering all the rain from Sunday, the trail really wasn't that bad.  A few of the streams were gushing water pretty good but were crossable. We did have to take our shoes off to wade thru one fast moving runoff and Picky Eater almost fell over when stepping on a sharp rock. Made it to the other side all dry.
The trail seemed a little easier today but it was muggy. Lots of smaller ups and downs and this week's rain washed a lot of the packed dirt away so more loose rocks than normal. 
We made it to Canopus Lake 14 miles down the trail. They had a small camp store and we were able to get burgers. One mile before getting there we came across a cooler with trail magic beers so we were able to take one and have it when we ate.

Our first stop is a deli and pizza shop about 10 miles away. It's a half mile off the trail but we heard there's new owners and they take good care of hikers. Picky Eater also needs some snack items for the next couple days.
The trail had the usual AT ups and downs but has flattened out a little as we got to Northern NY. By tomorrow we'll pass into Connecticut.  One good thing about having all the rain on Sunday is that there's water runoff all along the trail to filter from.
About a mile before the deli, someone left a trail magic cooler full of drinks and snickers bars. Picky Eater grabbed a beer to have with lunch. Perfect timing. Got to the deli about 10:30. That's the earliest we've done 10 miles the whole trail. Ordered a giant breakfast sandwich. They had just enough resupply selection to get us to the next town. 
After finishing our lunch beers, we headed back out down the road a half mile back to the trail. It was already getting pretty warm but a breeze was keeping it manageable. It seemed like the trail got easier as the day went on. Maybe because we ate a good lunch.
Made it to a tent site about 21 miles down the trail. It was already 5:00 and rain was forecast for the night so this would be a good place to stop. Also, there was a stream nearby for water. We ate and ducked into the tents, the mosquitoes made us hurry.","Canopus Lake Shelter

Rain was forcast for a couple hours with a storm moving thru. We also will be passing into Connecticut about 19 miles into the day.
The trail was average for the Appalachian trail. Not too easy and not too hard. There were swampy we areas with raised boards laid out to walk on for 30yard sections at a time. With all the rain lately, they get slippery so it slows things down a bit. 
About 2 hours into the day, the thunder started getting louder and faster. It was time to get out the rain jacket and put the phone into a plastic bag. The rain hit fast and the lightning was pretty intense just as Picky Eater was coming across a large open field. Time to sprint to the tree line.
The rain storm lasted about 1.5 hours. It cooled things off which was nice, but now we've got wet feet the rest if the day. The trail got pretty muddy too.
Picky Eater caught back up to Dangbird about half way thru the day. We stopped for lunch and made plans to go all the way to Mt Algo Shelter to set up for the night. That would put us just outside of Kent, CT and we could hit town the next day.
The last 2 miles into the shelter were tough. Rocky inclines and steep rocky descent right after everything got wet from the rain. We also were finishing back to back 20+ mile days.

He had a package waiting for him at the next town up 10 miles away. We'd meet up in Kent later in the morning. 
The town was fairly small but everything we needed was close by. There was a welcome center with clean bathrooms and a shower for hikers ($2 for 4 minutes). We Were able to hit the outfitters and grocery store for resupply and did laundry at the laundromat. 
We spent most of the day in town. Just as we were getting ready to eat one last meal before leaving, a young couple came up to us at the visitor center and asked if they could buy us pizza and beer. Buckaroo had thru hiked the AT a couple years ago and they were on a mission today to help out some hikers. We all went over to the pizza place and had a great time talking about the trail. It was a humbling experience that we won't forget. 
We left town about 4pm and hiked another 7 miles to Stewart Hollow Shelter.  It was an easy hike, mostly along a dirt road beside the river. The trail had been diverted here because of a bridge being washed out.

The trail started off with easy terrain although the trail was muddy. We eventually ended up with a long road walk because several of the river crossings on the trail were unpassable. We followed the Housatonic river for about 10 miles. An already large river, that was almost overflowing the banks in sections from all the rain. We were dry though.
Stopped at a river guide service along the way. They had a little store and let us plug in our phones to charge for a bit. The trail went near the town of Falls Village. When we passed Great Falls there was so much water coming over the falls it looked like the Grand Canyon.
We passed the 1500 mile mark today. Less than 700 miles to go!
Our destination was Limestone Spring Shelter which was a half mile straight down a tricky side trail. Normally we wouldn't venture so far from the main trail to camp but Connecticut is Picky about where you can set up. By the time we reached the shelter we were getting attacked by mosquitoes and out came the bug spray. The tent area had recently been flooded but was dry enough to set up.

We made it to the small town of Salisbury,  CT by 10am. There was a small grocery store and deli waiting for us. Picky Eater had a breakfast sandwich and fried chicken before picking up a few resupply items. There was an area for us to recharge our battery packs. 
We ended up spending about 4 hours in town, mostly chatting with a ridge runner who was hanging out for a bit. He has spent the last two summers paid by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy to walk the trail, stay at shelters and help/inform hikers about the trail. A few locals stopped by and one bought us all some Klondike ice cream bars.
We hit the trail again about 2pm and hiked another 5 miles to Ball Brook campsite.  It looked like it was going to rain a few times but we dodged getting wet for now. The campsite was high up on a ridge and it looks like we'll have it to ourselves for the night. Tomorrow will be bigger miles and well pass into Massachusetts. 
Thinking a lot tonight about everything it took to get this far down the trail. Passing 1500 miles was a big morale booster. Other than some toe blisters and sore feet on the long mile days, we are injury free and feeling good about finishing by the first week of September. There is no way we could make it this far without all the help we received. Grinch encourages Picky Eater every day and helps us get through the lows of rainy days and constant mountain climbing. Sometimes she's on speaker phone hiking right along. We receive trail magic almost daily. Sometimes just water. But more often it's a beer, pizza, snacks, ice cream or a freshly cooked burger at a trail crossing.

Three mountain climbs early on today. Bear Mountain wasn't too bad going up but steeper technical coming down. The second climb was a bit steeper and continued on a rock ledge with a steep dropoff for about a quarter mile. The view was amazing. Someone who is afraid of heights would have a tough time here. The Third climb up Mt. Everett was one of the steepest climbs and descents we've had since the Smokies. It was slow going coming down. Many sections of holding on to trees to drop down a few feet. 
After the climbs,  the trail leveled off thru a combination of pine forest, wet meadows and fields. The mosquitoes were bad here if you stopped for even a minute. It is also pretty muddy in the low sections from last week's flooding.  Overall, today's hike was some of the most scenic we've traveled the entire hike. A taste of what we should see going north.
When we got to Rt. 7 we hitched a ride into town. It took about 15 minutes to get a ride. Not bad for a couple smelly, bearded hippy looking hikers. There was a grocery store and restaurants nearby and we decided to eat at McDonald's for a quick meal before setting up.

We got an early start and were on the trail at 7:00. No big climbs today but the trail had long muddy sections. No way around it, our feet are getting wet. Picky Eater had lots of energy and moved on ahead at a good pace. 
About 11:30, started looking for a good dry spot for lunch. Just before a road crossing, Picky Eater started to smell bacon. Right then, at a parking area, there was a large setup with a group of people with trail magic. They had a Blackstone grill to cook fresh bacon cheeseburgers for thru hikers. Picky Eater was the first hiker coming through for the day and was treated like a rock star. Burgers, snacks and sports drinks. And real chairs!
A couple hours later, coming up a rocky incline, Picky Eater looked up and there, three feet away was a momma bear and 2 cubs. They were hiding behind a log and it was a lot. Of commotion for a few seconds while they decided which direction was the best escape route.  No time for a picture though. 
Got to Dalton,  MA about 4pm, a 20 mile day. There is a trail angel that live right on the trail where it runs thru town. Tom Levardis has been letting hikers camp in his back yard for over 40 years. He welcomed us to camp and had a charging station and fresh water. A neighbor showed up with fresh brownies and oranges. It was heartwarming.  Nice flat Grassy area will make for a good night's sleep.","Upper Goose Pond Shelter

The trail out of town was an easy road walk for a couple miles, then the long 12 mile ascent towards Mount Greylock. We won't make it the whole way to Greylock today but ¾ of the 3400 ft climb will be done.
Early on, we came across some trail magic. Two 2019 thru hikers were set up with snacks and chairs.  Picky Eater was able to grab a beer to put in the pack for tonight. 
The climb wasn't exceptionally hard but it did go on for the rest of the day till we arrived at Noepel Shelter.  Picky Eater was first to arrive so he got the choice wooden tent platform.  Once other hikers arrived,  we made dinner and enjoyed our beer.Hikers kept showing up after dark and the shelter camp spots filled up.

The memorial is a beautiful concrete tower dedicated to soldiers that made the ultimate sacrifice.  We were able to climb the spiral staircase to the top and lookout over the 360 degree panoramic views.
Back on the trail we had a 6 mile steep decent into the outskirts of Williamstown, MA. There was a grocery store that had resupply and deli food. A storm was coming thru so we hung out in front until it passed about 5:30 before getting back on the trail. 
The rain delay made us change our plans and we only hiked a couple more miles to Sherman Brook Campsite.  An easy afternoon hike and we were set up in no time. Thankful to dodge the rain once again.

They call Vermont (Vermud) for a good reason. Half of the day was spent walking in mud or walking around mud. I think this is going to be the trail for the next week or so.
Stopped About half way thru the day and ate a good lunch. Picky Eater washed two pairs of his socks in a stream and hung them on the back of his pack to dry. 
Not much for views today. Just hiking through mud and boulder hopping. It felt like one of the tougher days on trail. The last mile and a half was straight up climb into camp. Hungry and tired, it'll be an early night.

Manchester Center has an outfitter so hopefully the 3rd pair will make it to Katahdin. 
Both Dangbird and Picky Eater slipped and fell today. No injuries but Dangbird broke his trekking pole in half. Good thing we're hitting the outfitter tomorrow.

This morning we'll hitch a ride back to the trail 5 miles away. Rain expected after 1:00 so we're probably going to get wet today.
A local picked us up as soon as we started walking down the road. It doesn't get any faster than that. When we arrived at the trailhead, there was a family set up with trail magic. We chatted for a bit and stuffed some free snacks into our packs. Starting off great today!
2 big climbs today. First was up Bromley Mountain, 3200 ft elevation. There's a seasonal ski resort at the top with nice views. We hung out by the chair lifts for a break. The second wasn't as bad up Styles Peak. 
Passed a few more Southbound thru hikers today. Most of them started in June as Mount Katahdin at the North end of the trail isn't opened up till then. 
We saw a pile of Moose droppings on the trail coming down the mountain. They weren't fresh so doubt we see the moose. In Alaska they make novelty jewelry out of these moose nuggets. 
We were hoping the rain held off till we got to Griffith Lake where we would be camping for the night but it started raining about a half hour before we arrived. A little wet, we set up our tents fast and got into dry clothes. We had nice wooden tent platforms so it'll be good sleeping. 
Made dinner in the tent vestibule out of the rain. When it stops we'll put our food in the bear box for the night. Only hiked 10.5 miles, which was enough. Tomorrow should be a longer day.","Manchester Center VFW

Today is going to be sunny so we'll dry them off at lunchtime. 
Dangbird and Picky Eater hiked together most of the day. Not a lot of climbs and the trail, while still muddy, was easier terrain. Things have begun to dry out from the big rains couple weeks ago. So far all the streams have been low and passable. 
Came across ""Boone"" today. We haven't seen him since Franklin, TN.  He had gotten off trail with knee problems and is now just doing section hikes. He said he remembered us well because Picky Eater had said he looked lie Neil Peart, the drummer for Rush.
We were going to try for a 19 Mile day but decided to camp at Bully Brook campsite . A nice spot not far off trail with flat tent spots. Hadn't had cell service all day and were happy to finally call home and check the weather.

We had a decent climb right off the bat this morning. Hoping that the rain holds off till later this afternoon and we can set up before it hits. The trail has dried up pretty good and it's a little easier hiking.
Passed a few Southbound hikers but not seeing as many northbounders lately.  A lot have dropped off by this point. The New England states have been hit with heavy rain for a month and the trail has taken its toll on many. Dangbird and Picky Eater feel great though.
About ⅔ thru the day we came across trail magic at a crossing.  Hotdogs and chips hit the spot for lunch. We sat and chatted with the local couple whose daughter hiked the trail 2 years ago. Her trail name was Snot Rocket. They were proud of her hike but not her trail name.
With about 2 hours before camp it started raining hard. It stopped as we got to Governor Clement Shelter but we were soaked and a bit chilled. Set up the tents. Got in and changed to dry clothes. We cooked diner in our tent vestibule and hunkered down for the night. It was going to get down to 45 again. 
No cell service at all so won't be able to check in with Grinch till tomorrow.  We've been good about touching base by text throughout the day so she's used to the no cell service times.

We stopped at Cooper Lodge shelter to take a break and snack. A group of Day hikers came thru and asked all about our hike. You would have thought they just met someone famous. We had fun playing the part of expert thru hikers, telling them some of the experiences we've been through and tidbits about the trail. With our long beards and weathered gear we sure look the part. 
Except for a good climb this morning. The trail was good and went thru a mossy green forest. Water was spread out along the trail so we didn't have to carry too much extra. 
A German hiker passed us, took a look and said,  ""Brothers?"". Nope, we've just been on trail since February.  Dang Bird and Picky Eater now have longer ĝrey beards and and are starting to look alike. 
Ŵe reached Giffotd State Park and got a $6.00 camping spot. Not the most level but we'll make it work. A section hiker had a hound dog that howled at everything that moved. It finally quieted down at dark so we were gonna be able to sleep after all.  At least it'll keep the bears away.
We were able to charge our battery packs and phones, so it was worth the $6 a person charge. Also,  the park was right on trail. No rain scheduled for tomorrow.","Governor Clement Shelter

We decided to leave our packs at the campground and walk a mile into town and have a deli sandwich before getting on the trail. Taking every opportunity to get some real food into us. A mile back to camp and we were ready to go.
A mile into the trail we hit a steep 1200 foot climb. More training for te White Mountains. The rest of the afternoon leveled off a bit until the steep decent into Stoney Brook shelter. There weren't any good tent sites there so we moved on a bit farther and found some good sites by a creek. Temperatures were already starting to drop.
While we were eating, Two Shoes and Greatfull showed up and set up camp. We hadn't seen them in a few days so it was good to catch up. Everyone is feeling good about finishing. About 5 more weeks with some challenging trail ahead. 
The next 2 days should be about 15 miles each and will set us up to get to arrive in Hanover,  NH on Saturday. Once we get into New Hampshire the tough climbs and beautiful views will hit.

Came within 3 feet of a skunk that was hanging out on the trail. Didn't see it till the last minute. It turned towards Picky Eater, who darted about 10 yards away to observe from a distance. Waited a few minutes till it turned and waddled into the woods before getting back on the trail.  Already smell bad enough without adding that scent.

The rain stopped a couple times just long enough for a quick snack break. The small stream crossings were just over the ankles to cross. Used the opportunity to clean the Mudd off of shoes and socks. The trail is super muddy and water flowing down the trail on all the uphill climbs. And it's slippery. 
Only Saw a few Southbound hikers today and no Northbounders.  Maybe everyone decided to hunker down and skip the rain today. Only a crazy few of us. The hikers also thinned out the farther north we got. I think estimates are as high as 75% of Northbounders have dropped off by this point. We feel good about finishing though. 
Tomorrow we cross into New Hampshire! Only 2 more states remain. We'll start getting into climbing up 4000+ ft mountains almost immediately.  After 1750 miles we should be in good enough shape to tackle them. Even if we slow down the miles.

The hike down to town was fairly easy. 3 miles of trail and the rest was road walk. Our first stop was to resupply at a general store that also had deli sandwiches.  They also had camp fuel so that saved us from trying to find an outfitter. 
Next we crossed over the Connecticut River and into Hanover, Hampshire, home of Dartmouth college. The town is pretty hiker friendly, but we only hung out long enough to stop at a convenience store for a couple things. 
We planned on going to the next shelter a couple more miles up trail but a lot of hikers were in town and it sounded like everyone was going there. Found a stealth spot to set up our tents behind the Dartmouth soccer fields. The sign said no camping so once again we would be breaking the law. At least we had it to ourselves.

It started raining about an hour into the morning and rained lightly all day. There was an enclosed shelter at the top of Smarts Mtn so we ducked in and ate a snack lunch. There were 3 other hikers there that were probably just going to ride out the rain for a day.

The rain held off early and then just a light rain on and off. The climb up was steep but not too technical till we got closer to the top.

A hiker in front of us was blown off his feet at the summit.  There weren't any steep drop offs where we were, so we felt safe. Took quick videos and pictures and quickly began our descent.

The hostel offered free slack packing where we could leave most of our gear there and hike today with just a few necessities. We only slackpacked one other time back in North Carolina. 
This was the most challenging hike of our adventure to date. Began with a steep climb that never ended. It was in the 60s to start and the wind picked up the higher we got. The last half mile before South Kinsman was hand pulling ourselves over boulders and slow going. As soon as we were above tree line it leveled off until we reached North Kinsman. There were beautiful panoramic views at both peaks. Thankfully,  the clouds broke and it wasn't raining. 
Again,  much of the trail, when not boulder climbing, was a thick mud bog. At times it was ankle deep. We welcomed stream crossings to wash our shoes off a bit. You get used to hiking in wet feet.
The climb down wasn't as steep but was miles of rock hopping and the occasional putting the trekking poles away to hand climb. Usually there's a stretch here and there of easier terrain to rest your brain from concentrating on the rocks, but not today. About 3 miles before the end we had a stream crossing. Normally you'd be able to rock hop across but with all the rain it was a wade thru with water almost waist deep. Not dangerous but you had to watch your footing. 
We must be in pretty good shape because we weren't warn out when finally reaching the bottom after 16 miles. We then had another mile on a bike path to reach the parking area for our shuttle back to the Hostel. 
Arrived in town and got out of our muddy gear and eat frozen pizzas just as it was getting dark. Back to sleeping on the trail tomorrow.

Today's hike was a fairly easy (By AT standards) hike. 2 miles downhill we stopped at Zealand Falls Hut. People pay $150 a night to sleep in a bunk here. Mostly day hikers. They let thru hikers stop by and eat any breakfast leftovers. We're not too proud, and Picky Eater isn't so picky anymore, so we timed it perfectly and ate cold eggs and pancakes. 
The rest of the trail was fairly flat and we made it 9 miles to a highway crossing. A 1999 thru hiker was set up with trail magic snacks so we stopped for a bit. We needed to get some resupply snacks and the closest convenience store was 8 miles away. Time to hitch a ride.
It didn't take long for someone to stop and pick up these two sorry looking hippie hikers. A van with a full timer and 2 large great Danes. Picky Eater jumped in the back and it didn't take long for the dogs and him to hit it off. Just as long as the ear scratches continued. 
We got a ride to the gas station and the awesome driver said he'd come back in a bit and give us a ride back to town. Yep, more ear scratching was demanded.

We made it 11 miles to Lake of the Clouds Hut. There were about 50 paying guests there getting pampered with dinner. Nothing fancy and they all sleep in bunk rooms. There is a room down below the hut that servers as an emergency shelter for winter hikers. In the summer they let thru hikers stay in it for $10. It holds 6 people. Dangbird and Picky Eater were able to get a bunk. 
We're about 1.4 miles from the peak of Mount Washington,  which is known for windy unpredictable weather. It looks like we'll have decent weather to summit and go 12 miles above treeline the rest of the day.","Stealth Site mile 1852.9

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668200,"We survived sleeping in the Dungeon of Lake of the Clouds Hut last night. Damp, dark and smelly, but there were 6 bunks and actually slept good. We had free breakfast leftovers and headed on the trail up towards Mount Washington at 9am.
The Boulder climb started right away and we were socked in the clouds but it was pretty cool to know we were climbing up such a rugged and anticipated section of the entire Appalachian Trail. From Lake of the Clouds to the summit was only 1.5 miles and we reached the top by 10:30. 
There was a visitor center at the top and tourists had already been arriving by train. Most were hanging out hoping the clouds would part so they could get a view. We hung around till noon recharging our battery packs and eating. The clouds didn't give way until beginning our long ridge walk and descent. The sky's opened up to some of the most beautiful scenery we'd ever seen. Had to take breaks every so often to take it all in. The trail here is 12 miles of Boulder hopping and boulder climbing so in order to really get the views you have to stop or risk breaking an ankle. 
The weather stayed nice until we neared Mount Madison.  Then the wind picked up, the clouds surrounded us and it started raining. By the time we reached Madison it was 30mph blowing rain and low visibility.  We were already drenched by the time our descent started. The trail here isn't much of a trail. Large boulder fields with only rock cairns to follow. Add the blowing rain and it was extremely difficult and slow going. We moved along, cairn to cairn pulling our phones out occasionally to make sure pops had us going in the right direction.  Averaging .5 to 1 mph it was clear we needed to get below tree line and find a camp spot for the night. It was close to 7pm when we finally got down out of the wind and found a stealth spot with enough room for 2 tents. (We fit 4 tents). One hiker was already there and another arrived just as we did. It was close quarters but everyone happy to be tucked in and warm. Everyone cooked in their tents. 
Whew, don't want to do that again anytime soon. The rain and wind died down as soon as we had hit tree line. It was quite a bit warmer too.","Lake of the Clouds Hut

Muddy slow decent with occasional rock hops was actually an improvement over what we've been seeing lately.  We'll be glad to see sunny weather again. 
Started raining again and making the trail a bit slippery so slow going. It won't be long and we'll hit the 1900 mile mark and be on our way to Maine. Really looking forward to going through the Mahoosuc Notch in a couple days. It's a much hyped section of the AT with many calling it the hardest (or funnest) mile of the trail.
We're probably a little over 3 weeks from finishing.  It's been a long time out here in all kinds of weather and terrain. We've slowed down considerably with the tough trail in New Hampshire but should be able to pick up the pace again in a week. Maine will be a little harder to resupply so we ordered some freeze dried meals and had them sent ahead. So glad to be reaching our final State this week!","Stealth site mile 1872.6

Heading into this stretch with 5 nights/6 days of food so packs are a bit on the heavy side. The sporting goods store in town had dehydrated meals.
Started out with a 1900 ft , 3 mile climb but the trail was much easier terrain than what we've been seeing.  Still a lot of mud sections from all the rain.
Stopped for a break at a rock outcrop with a nice view and set up our chairs for a break. We're only going about 12 miles today and with the early start we get to take our time for a change. Dangbird showed up all excited that he just saw a moose. It was right on trail and both he and the moose were startled. It ran off crashing thru the trees.
Arrive at Gentian Pond Shelter just before 4. There were wooden tent platforms so we set up our chairs next to the tents. It felt like sitting out on our own front porches. Hung out while we ate and enjoyed an adult beverage.  We were sound asleep by 8:00pm.

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668254,"Started off with our usual morning climb up Mount Success. We crossed over 4 mountain tops today. It wasn't as much elevation as we've been doing but probably some of the most technical climbing of the trail so far. Lots of steep pull your self up sections and holding tree branches on the downs. There's still a lot of mud. Some areas the only choice was to step thru ankle deep mud soup.
About 5 miles into the day we crossed the border into Maine.  13 States done and on our last one! We planned on taking a good break at the border to take in the accomplishment but the sign was right in the middle of a mud pit. We found a good spot about a half mile ahead and set up our chairs. It's hard to fathom we've made it this far. About 80% of the hikers have dropped out. 1916 miles done and 282 miles to go. We're tired but feeling good. 
The rest of the trail today was a lot of technical ups and downs with beautiful views as rewards. At one peak we could see Mount Washington in the distance (50 trail miles away). By the time we reached Full Goose Shelter our shoes and legs were covered with mud.
Full Goose Shelter is the highest shelter on the AT. There were nice large wood tent platforms to set up on. Two Shoes and Greatfull showed up. We'll all clime thru Mahoosuc Notch together in the morning.","Gentian Pond Shelter

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668286,"It got down to 45 last night. It was clear skies and there's a lot of condensation on the tent. It's a two coffee morning. 
In one mile we'll start climbing thru the Mahoosuc Notch. Some say it's the hardest mile on the AT. Others say it's the funnest.  Picky Eater thinks it'll be both. Right after the Notch is a steep 1500 ft, one mile climb. 
The terrain got technical and slow going right after leaving camp. Slow going but we were not no hurry. This was the one day we decided to take our time. It was sunny and 62 when we got to the Notch. Dangbird led the way. 
The Mahoosuc Notch was piles of large boulders in a somewhat narrow channel a mile long. Some we were able to climb over, others we climbed in-between and thru small caves. Had to stop and analyze the best and safest route each step. Picky Eater was using muscles he hadn't used since playground days. We took pictures and video and helped each other pass our backpacks thru the smaller cave channels. The 1 mile took about 2.5 hours.
Immediately after the Notch we had a steep mostly rock slab climb up the Mahoosuc Arm. More slow going until we reached Speck Pond Shelter. 8 hours of hiking/scramblin/climbing for the day to go 5.1 miles. 
The shelter had nice tent platforms and wasn't too full so we picked the largest one and set up. Other hikers rolled in throughout the lae afternoon. Temperature started to drop and it was going to get down to 42 tonight. Surely we'll be able to pick up the miles soon.","Full Goose Shelter

Picky Eater,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668332,"Cold night. Got down to 42 and lots of condensation in the tent. The sun is shining bright so everything is drying up fast.
900 ft clime up old Speck Mountain then a long 3.5 mile descent down. Not too technical, actually pretty  fast hiking, but long sections of rock slabs that could be slippery if you didn't pay attention. Dangbird took a pretty good fall. A few bruises but he'll be fine. 
When we came down to the hwy 26 there were 2 separate people set up with trail magic snacks.  We hung out for a bit and were offered a ride to town to resupply.  We still had 3 days food but the resupply locations are far and in-between in Maine so we decided to take the offer. Went into Bethel to stock up on snacks. 
It's nice to have some trail ahead that, although not easy, will alow us to get some miles in again. Probably only 3 more resupply points from here to the end of the trail.

We picked up some dehydrated Peak meals Picky had shipped to The Hiker Hut Hostel near Rangeley,  ME. We were originally going to stay here but there's no electricity to recharge our battery packs so there is no need.
I'll be posting as we have cell service in the next 200 miles. Pretty sure we won't have cell service in the 100 mile Wilderness at all. Sometimes I can squeeze a text message out to Grinch but uploading journal entries or photos is tough. 
Lots of emotions right now. Really want this journey to be ending but still loving it and all the accomplishments. We passed the 6 months mark and will be done in less than 3 weeks.

A few other hikers showed up and we cramped into the few tent spaces. There were row boards on the shoreline and a few of them went out on the lake. They saw a moose on the opposite shore.
The weather this morning was decent. We climbed 1500 ft almost immediately up to Saddleback mountain. It was above Ridgeline for a good portion and opened up to 360 degree views at the top. Picky Eater and Dangbird set up chairs and took a break. Maine is beautiful!
We made good time today and decided to camp at Sluice Brook Logging road. Our site was at the top of a waterfall. After keeping our feet dry all day, there was a good side stream to walk thru right before getting there. Shin deep meant wet shoes and socks. At least the mud got cleaned off.
We had camp set up by 4pm and were able to take our time cooking and hanging out in the sun.","Eddy Pond campsite

The first climb today wasn't too bad. 1500 ft but spread out over 3 miles to Lone Mountain and Mount Abraham.  Then another similar climb up to Sugarloaf.  Small openings along the way with spectacular views.
We reached the 2,000 mile mark about lunchtime. No big sign saying you made it this far. Just 2,000 laid out in rocks, but the emotions were running high. We had cell service so Picky Eater was able to call Grinch and share the moment. Less than 200 miles to go!
The climb down Sugarloaf was steep and slow with views that let you know it was Maine. Thankfully it was a beautiful sunny day. This would have been tough if the rocks were wet. We took our time and occasionally stopped to take in the views.
Our destination was Crocker Mountain campsite. There were 3 wood tent platforms and a crystal clear stream for water. It started sprinkling later in the evening so we ended up eating under cover of the tent.","Sluice Brook Logging road

First off, an 1800 foot climb up South and North Crocker mountains. Spread out over 2 miles, the climb was steep at first but nothing we haven't done before. Most of today was thru spruce forest and it had the feel like there was going to be a moose around every corner. Picky Eater kept an eye out just in case.
Another hiker had left the camping area an hour before us. When he came up behind us at South Crocker Mountain we asked how did that happen.  Well, he took a wrong turn and headed south when he got on the trail and made it a couple miles before realizing he went the wrong way. Picky Eater (and most hikers) knows that feeling. 
After getting to the top, we had a 5 mile decent to our pick up point. It went fairly fast. Lots of tree roots to negotiate in Maine. It was fairly sunny and in the 70s, so nice hiking. 
Arrived at ME 27 about 1:00pm and the yellow mini school bus shuttle picked us up shortly after. First stop, the local general store to pick up some greasy pizza slices and some beer for later.

It was 9:45 when we started out on the trail. About a mile in there was a group of volunteers with a large pile of lumber. They we building new tent platforms another mile down the trail and had to carry it all to that location.  Picky Eater grabbed an 8ft 2x6 and carried it. It seemed light at first but was glad to finally get there.
Today's climb wasn't too bad. It was spread out over 5 miles so no steep sections. The top of South Bigelow Mountain was one of the most beautiful views of the trail. It helped that the skies were clear and you could see Mountain ranges 360 degrees.  Another mile descent down to Bigelow Col Campsite.  There were 4 wood tent platforms tucked into the pines. The wind was picking up so it was nice to be sheltered.

Short but steep climb up Bigelow Avery Peak to start the day. Not a real difficult climb bit it was above tree line and wind was gusting pretty good. The view at the top was stunning. The drop off over the edge was even more stunning. Climbing down took a while with steep descent the whole way. The trail finally leveled off and was some of the easier hiking we had in a while.
Picky Eater eventually caught up to Dangbird at West Carry Pond Lean-to. A Lean-to is basically what was called a shelter the rest of the trail.

We made good time today. Just had to deal with tree roots and mud but some of the easiest hiking we've had in weeks, maybe months. Passed a few ponds and saw a family of wood ducks swimming in the 2nd. The last 2 miles were rocky and a little more difficult but we arrived at the Kennebec by 12:30. The canoe guide came across the river and paddled us back. We're told a couple of hikers have drowned trying to wade/swim across in the past. 
We hitched a ride 6 miles down the road to Barry's general store for some resupply and bacon cheeseburgers. It only took a few minutes to hitch a ride back to the trail. They love hikers around here.
