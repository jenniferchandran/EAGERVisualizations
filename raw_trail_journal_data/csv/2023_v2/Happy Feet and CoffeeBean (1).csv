Happy Feet and CoffeeBean ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665377,"So we have 600 miles left to finish our hike of the AT. This is the perfect number for us because we seem to hit that many miles and have to get off because of injury or just plain homesickness. But we don’t want to spend another winter saying “I wish we had kept going.” Also, we have heard so much talk about hiking the Whites (the White Mountain range in New Hampshire) and how difficult it is, terrain-wise and weather-wise, that we want to get there and see for ourselves. We have had hikers warn us about other tough places on the trail and after we hike them we think “That wasn’t as bad as we thought it would be.” We’re hoping that holds true with the Whites. Stay tuned. Near the end of the hike, just before Mt Katahdin, we will hike through what is called the “100 Mile Wilderness”. No amenities, no phone service, nothing. Just you and nature. It is also supposed to be some of the most beautiful hiking on the trail. Other hiker friends have taken extra days through it, stopping to camp by lakes and just listening to the silence. We are looking forward to that. We have also packed a box of food to ship to Shaw’s Hostel, just before entering the Wilderness. We are planning for 12 days. We’ll carry in 6 days worth and then Shaw’s will drop a bucket (that we have filled with additional food) halfway through. Thank God! The thought of carrying 12 days of food?! I would be crawling the first 6 days because I wouldn’t be able to stand on my feet from the weight!We have our packs almost ready too. Big difference in what we need to take for the AT and what we needed for the Camino! I have washed, aired, and Febrezed my sleeping bag, hoping it will stay fairly stink-free for at least half the hike. Right now I have calculated my pack at 30.5 pounds with water and food. Coffeebean is 38 pounds. Doesn’t sound so bad until you start hiking up a 6000ft mountain. ",,View Entry,"Jun 12, Mon",0
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665744,"Sooo originally we had planned to celebrate our grandson’s high school graduation on Saturday and then leave Sunday for Maine and my brother’s house. After the festivities Saturday and all the fun we had spending time with family, we decided to take another day in Rochester and just hang with family. Spent most of the day at my sister, Marg, and her husband, Brian’s, house. It was a slow and restful day. Perfect. 


Today we got up at 6am, thanked my brother, Rob, for his great hospitality and headed to Maine. Time to leech off another sibling, my brother, Tom. Haha


We decided to avoid the crazy Massachusetts drivers and take a more scenic route through Vermont and New Hampshire. We drove through part of the White Mountains. We will be hiking through them in about a month. They are big! The whole drive was beautiful and we are getting excited about hiking this last 600 miles. 


Tomorrow will be a rest day. Driving 9 hours today and then getting back in the car the next day to drive 4-1/2 hours to the trail didn’t sound enticing. This also gives us time to visit with Tom and his humongous, but pretty, cat named Cleo.",,View Entry,"Jun 19, Mon",0
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665807,"We woke up at 5 this morning but had agreed to leave at 7 so we dozed for an hour. Tom carb-loaded us last night with a delicious dinner of spaghetti and homemade sauce. It was great!


After a breakfast this morning of oatmeal (or “gruel” as I lovingly call it), juice, and tea (for me)/coffee (for David), we hit the road. 


We got to Salisbury, CT on highway 41 about 1:45. By 2pm we were waving goodbye to Tom and starting out. There was a cooler with amazing trail magic right at the trailhead! If we had been on the trail awhile we would have hunkered down and pigged out. There was cut up watermelon in the cooler too!! The folks who left the trail magic stopped by and we chatted for a bit.


Of course leaving town is always a hill climb. This pack is so freaking heavy! I told CoffeeBean we will never carry 6 days of food again! Well, until we get to the 100 Mile Wilderness. Then we will have too. 


So we hiked for about an hour when we ran into 2 day hikers coming down the mountain. We stopped and chatted and then turned to go and one of the lady’s said “Buen Camino”. We both turned back at the same time and I said “You recognize this?”, pointing to my buff with yellow shells and yellow arrows, symbols of the Camino. They said they had walked it from Sarria in 2018. What a shock to run into someone that recognized my buff and what it meant! And they were the first hikers we had met!



The mountain laurel is in bloom everywhere. The mountain is covered in the beautiful blooms. 
Farther on we met some folks coming back from one of the shelters that they are rebuilding. We talked a bit and they asked how far we were going. Then they said “Katahdin or bust”? We laughed and said that, yes, we were finishing the trail this time. They told us the Brassie Brook shelter was complete and we should check it out. A few minutes later we met another maintenance worker and after asking how far we were going, also said “Katahdin or bust”, huh? We said yes. And I thought “Why does everyone keep saying that?” 


We got to Brassie Brook and it is very nice. There was a hiker asleep in the shelter already. There is a nice privy and a bear box. We decided we would stop here for the night. As I pulled my pack off and set it on the bench it all became clear. My sneaky brother had taped a big sign on the back of my pack that read “Katahdin or Bust!!” (CoffeeBean walked ahead of me so he never saw the sign either.) I will definitely hang onto it for inspiration.


A 4.2 mile uphill day. Not a long day but we are satisfied.","Brassie Brook Shelter
",View Entry,"Jun 21, Wed",4.20
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665848,"So the night in the shelter wasn’t bad especially when it started getting cooler. The mosquitoes took off then. During the night we were taken back to our albergue days a few times when the guy sharing the shelter with us started snoring. :)


Our first climb of the day was up and down Bear Mountain. The up was very strenuous and the down required some hands and feet to climb over the big rocks. 

Then came Race Mountain. Another yucky uphill but at the top were the Race Ledges. The view was beautiful and the breeze cooled us right down. Climbing down required walking along the ledges on the edge of the mountain. You really had to pay attention. I am carrying 30 pounds, which is more than I should for my weight, so I was careful to be sure my pack wasn’t shifting on my back. 
Coming down Race I fell two times. The first time, I tripped on a rock, and if not for a tree that I grabbed, I would have totally face-planted. Then I was walking around a rock and the ground next to it gave way and my right leg started sliding down the edge. 


We were low on water and had one more mountain to climb (Everett) before getting to the shelter. Finally found a small stream and cameled up and had lunch. We tried these bars called Meal-to-Go. They are high in calories and protein. The flavor was Spicy Caramel Apple. Why would you add spicy with caramel apple? I don’t care for spicy anyways and I sure didn’t care for that. 



Then our last climb up Everett Mountain. We were told this would be a good example of what to expect when we get to the White Mountains in New Hampshire. It sucked. The summit was 2602 and a 650’ elevation in .7 of a mile. That is steep. I was sucking wind bad. David has been like the Little Engine That Could just powering up the mountains. I have been like the Little Engine that Said WTH??!!
Coming down Everett CoffeeBean stopped short and told me to back up. There laying across the trail was a rattlesnake. We threw some stones and branches at it and that usually sends them slithering away. Not this guy. He turned and looked at us and headed our way, rattle shaking. Like “Come on sista. I’ll take you on and da man too! This is my rock and I ain’t movin’”. And he didn’t. We had to bushwhack through brush and trees and go around. He was watching us as we came out of the underbrush. Little jerk!


We got to Hemlock Shelter and Buster had been there for 2 hours already. (We met him earlier in the day. He is from Ottawa, Canada and is doing a flip-flop. He mentioned staying at this shelter and I figured he would get there probably 2 hours before us and I was right!)


He kindly gave up his lower bunk for me so I didn’t have to climb up and down a ladder. This shelter holds 10 and there is a big upper floor in addition to the 2 bunkbeds. We decided to cook one of our homemade dinners that I cooked and dehydrated. This one was made my David, his homemade chili. I split it out into several meals and dehydrated it. He heated up water, put it in the bag and let it sit for about 30 mins. IT WAS FANTASTIC! To have something that delicious on trail was so great. We wolfed it down. It looked like a lot and we thought we would have some to share with Buster, but today was not his lucky day. Sorry Buster. 


Today was 8.8 miles. Not a lot but these were very tough miles so we were OK with it. 


Oh, we also figured out last night that we had miscalculated our mileage to Katahdin. We thought we had 600 miles when we really have 685. Crap!","Brassie Brook Shelter
",Hemlock Shelter,"Jun 22, Thu",8.80
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665969,"So the only choice we have is to do 8.8 to Great Barrington or 14.4 to the next shelter beyond. So we’ve been on the trail for one full day. We’re ready to do a 14 miler. Um, no we weren’t!


It started out fairly level and then big climb down. Once we got down there were some nice level areas. There were some pretty pastures and a wooded area. A Guthook comment said “The next 2.25 miles is brought to you by Deep Woods Off. Mosquitoes are crazy so deet up and run like hell!” I put on bug spray and had my head net ready but the mosquitoes were not bad at all. One lady said she had seen hikers come out of the woods crying! The Good Lord was smiling on us today!



Them we come out of the woods and start to cross the road and see a sign saying “Trail Magic”. A man waved us over and asked if we wanted a hamburger or hotdog and all the fixins. Didn’t have to invite us twice! They had watermelon, chips, soda, and fun conversation. There are severa churches and organizations that sign ip to provide magic 6 days a week fro June to August. Just being able to sit in a chair with a back was great. We were powered up and figured “Yeah, we can make that next 6 miles.” 
Later we thought about it and said we should have stayed in a hotel in Great Barrington and had a nice meal because it is our 33rd wedding anniversary! Made us mad that we didn’t think of those plans sooner. For the past 3 or 4 years we have missed Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, our anniversary, and CoffeeBean’s birthday because we have been on trail. WE have decided that from now on our vacations/hikes will be planned around the special occasions!


After leaving the trail magic we crossed another road and saw a guy stocking up water for the hikers. The river around here (the Hoosatonic or something like that is badly polluted so people generously leave jugs of water at the trailheads.) His name is Harry and he also makes these hiking sticks called Tiger Stripes. They are so cool but we have poles. We may stop on the way home in Sept to get one though. Harry is 87 and still really active. 


Of course the hike to Tom Leonard shelter was grueling. An hour from the shelter it began to rain. We finally dragged in about 5:35, exhausted and with no water. None of the river crossings had water.


I said “I will give $10 to anyone who will go down and get us water!” Sam said “I’ll do it!” Turns out he is a trail runner. (They move from shelter to shelter checking things out and helping out hikers.) Everyone laughed but I said I was serious as we had no water. He gave us water and jumped up to go down the .2 miles to the water. (He also insisted that we not pay him because he enjoyed doing it and that’s why he was there - to help out hikers, but we insisted he take it and and buy himself lunch.) Another couple returned just as Sam started down and he told them we were giving him $10 to get water. They said “Hey, we would have given you $10!”  


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> Heavy rain is due tonight so we stayed in the shelter. Someday the rain will stop and we will he able to have our own little house again. I can’t wait!


14.4 miles was too much for our second day on trail. Tomorrow will be a short day. Counting the days till we get to a town with a hostel or hotel!","Hemlock Shelter
",Tom Leonard shelter,"Jun 23, Fri",14.40
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666102,"So “Slip, Sliding Away” was the theme song for the day. Everything was wet. All the leaves, rocks, tree roots. And tree roots are unbelievably slippery when they are wet! We were so tired from yesterday that we were the last ones out. At 9:30!


It rained on and off all day as we walked/climbed/slid. We are still sucking wind going uphill and stopping to rest at the top. But even a 5 minute rest makes a big difference. We are just trying to “embrace the suck” as they say on the AT. 


We decided that we are not ready for big mile days and that’s fine with us. Today we hiked 5.4 to the South Wilcox shelter. It was pretty chewed ip by porcupines. Oz was there waiting for the weather to clear. Said he wasn’t going to walk during the day and get all wet. The rain was supposed to quit by 4:30 so he would leave then and do a night hike. He was a very experienced hiker and seemed very knowledgeable. Almost to the point of a know-it-all, but we listened and oohed and aahed at the right moments. 


Lighthouse showed up and we talked about the new shelter that was supposed to be here. I had already said that there was supposed to be a new one here at South Wilcox but Oz said that North Wilcox was the new one. I said “Then why does Guthook show 3 pictures of different shelters?” So Lighthouse said he was going to go down this other path and check. He comes back all excited and said there was a bigger and newer shelter. So we all went down to see. It was like the Tom Leonard and slept 10. CoffeeBean snagged a lower bunk but Lighthouse had already grabbed the other. I’m sure he would have moved if I asked him but I just took the bunk above CoffeeBean. 


We hung out and talked awhile and then Chowder and Hot Cakes showed up. They took the upper loft. 


Everyone had stuff hanging everywhere trying to dry it out. Chowder and Hot Cakes took their tent up to the old shelter and hung it across there to dry. Came back an hour or so later with a dry tent. 



The rain had stopped but more was due tonight and it was so humid and muggy. I want to sleep in my tent without mosquitoes buzzing in my ears all night but carrying a wet tent is really heavy. So the shelter it is. 
YOLO stopped by just to eat and rest and then pushed on to the North Wilcox shelter. That one is supposed to he farther in and really buggy according to Sam, the trail runner, so he is welcome to it. 


Short day but we are happy and resting. By the way, the hike we are doing is not a section hike or a thru-hike. It is referred to as a LASH. Long Ass Section Hike. ","Tom Leonard Shelter
",South Wilcox Shelter,"Jun 24, Sat",0
Happy Feet and CoffeeBean ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666108,"Everyone woke about 5:30 and began preparing for the day. This morning about 2 or 3am the skies opened and poured rain. There was also lightning. I slept through the lightening. 



They are all hiking the 16 miles to Goose Pond. We are doing 6.8 to Shaker Campsite. Chowder said the first half of the day is pretty level but level to a thru-hiker with 1600 miles on his legs and level to us may be two different things. We walked up to the old South Wilcox shelter. (You have to walk past it to go out.) CoffeeBean went to get water. I did it last night. You walked down a path and there was a large group of rocks. The spring was coming from under the rocks so I had to get down on my hands and knees and scoop water out of a small pool. I could just reach the pool surface so it was his turn. In the shelter was a hiker named Lotus. She had stayed in the old shelter last night and said the mosquitos were terrible. She started hiking in GA and was only going to do that state but when she finished GA she had caught the hiking bug. She flip-flopped up to Harpers Ferry to finish the north section before Katahdin closes and then will do the southern section in the fall. 


Chowder was right after all. The hike to Shaker Campsite was very nice and easy. Still wet but not bad and plenty of water finally. We had to walk on the edges on a beaver fam to get past a pond. With the recent rain some of the boards were close to be under water. We had quite a few boardwalks this morning through wetlands. 


We got to the campsite by 11:30. It had once been a settlement of the Shaker religious community. There was a paper in the campsite log book telling about it. Lotus and I read it and were confused by the two statements “The Shakers were celibate.” and “In 1792 their numbers grew and they began to build a settlement.” Not sure how that worked. 


We discussed going on to Goose Pond Cabin but 1) there are 2 big mountains to climb to get there, 2) we already knew of at least 7 people going and the cabin there only holds 14, 3) we still had 10 miles to go, 4) we would be dragging in after 6pm, 5) it was calling for rain tonight. So we stayed at Shaker Campsite. Had a nice relaxing lunch. I was craving tortilla with a pulled pork packet, if you can believe that. No tuna packets this trip! 



The sun came out! There were 2 wooden platforms for tents. One was in the full sun so we laid all our damp/wet stuff out and it dried great. We set up on the other platform. 
A while later Lotus showed up and we sat and talked with her. Holly and 2 other hikers showed up later in the afternoon. We had another homemade dehydrated meal for dinner - Pasta with sausage and red peppers. CoffeeBean couldn’t stop raving about it. It was delicious, if I may say so myself. 


We had just finished dinner and were putting things away and the food bags in the bear box when there was a giant clap of thunder. Everyone went scrambling for their tent and then it poured buckets. We are fat and full and dry (with dry clothes for tomorrow!) in our tent so we are happy! The thunder continued for quite a while but moved out finally and just left us with a light drizzle. Supposed to stop during the night. Would love it if the tent dried. 


We are excited about tomorrow’s destination. The Goose Pond has a huge enclosed cabin with 14 bunks with mattresses! There are also tent sites. But best of all? In the morning the volunteer caretaker makes all-you-can-eat pancakes and coffee. There is also a pond there (duh, Goose Pond) and you can swim or rent a canoe and go out on the pond. So tomorrow will be fun, once we get there. Then the next day, we hike 11 miles to the Cookie Lady’s house and you can camp in her yard and it’s all-you-can-eat cookies and lemonade! And then we do 9.6 miles into the town of Dalton for a hotel and shower and clean clothes!! Woo hoo!! This girl ain’t gonna stink no more! At least for a day. ","South Wilcox Shelter

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666167,"The day started out well. We had been able to dry everything yesterday so neither of us had to dress in damp or downright wet clothes. It had rained and thundered hard last night so the tent and rain canopy were wet. Also we had set up our tent on a wooden platform. Keep it off the ground, the tent stays drier. Except we couldn’t pull the guy lines on the rain canopy taut so they laid a little against the actual tent. We could feel a bit of mist because of that but not enough to get us wet and I thought it was cooling. (The temp had gotten to 80 degrees in the afternoon so in the tent was pretty warm.)
We toweled off a lot of the water and put the canopy in a plastic kitchen trash bag that I bring just for that purpose. The tent was dry enough to go in its carry bag. 


After breakfast (which I have to make myself eat because I’m not hungry in the morning but know I need the calories.) we started hiking about 7:40. We are only doing 10 miles and figured to get there by 2 at the latest. 


We made it up the first of two big climbs for the day and felt good. We weren’t sucking wind as bad and didn’t have to rest much. We came to a road crossing and saw a sign “AT Trail Stand”. Soda, snacks, free wifi, and electricity to charge electronics. A hiker’s dream! Lotus and Mad Dog were already there. We drank a soda each and split some Oreos. I changed out of my rain pants into my hiking pants because I was sweating so badly. (Sorry, Mom. I know that “ladies don’t sweat, they glisten” but if you smelled me, this girl was definitely sweating.) 


We walked on and did a lot of boardwalking through swamps and pond areas. The boards were super slick so we walked slowly and carefully on them. 




The second big climb was not as bad until the rain started. It began about 12:30 and didn’t stop. Then the thunder began to. It was very loud. No lightening, but thunder. We hiked as fast as we could to get to the Upper Goose Pond cabin. We finally got to the trailhead and knew we still had 1/2 a mile to get to the actual cabin. We were soaking wet and hiked double-time! As we got closer ai could smell campfire. We finally came up to the cabin and a group were out under the covered picnic tables eating. There are only 14 beds in the cabin and I was so worried that we wouldn’t get a bunk but I prayed several times while we were hiking and the Good Lord answered my prayers!

Inside the cabin was a beautiful fire going in the front room. There was spring water in jugs on the front porch. You just had to filter it. No electricity or indoor plumbing. Cell coverage was spotty. Bit the bunks had actual mattresses and the cabin was enclosed - 4 walls and a roof!
They showed us upstairs to pick a bunk. I grabbed a top bunk by the screened window. CoffeeBean was in the top bunk next to me. He sat down by the fire for several hours, warming up.
I was so tired. I climbed into my bunk and tried to sleep. Then the bottom dropped out and the rain poured buckets. Suddenly the guy under me (let me clarify, in the bunk under me) jumped up and said he was getting wet. The rain was now coming down sideways and coming in through the screen. My sleeping bag and clothes bag were already damp. We found a wood window cover and were able to get that into the window to block the rain.



The caretakers are volunteers that come up for a week at a time. This week was a woman, Kathy, and her 4 kids. The oldest daughter, trail name Fern, was in charge of greeting hikers and explaining the rules and showing them around. The youngest, Evelyn, is 5 years old and so precocious. She buzzed around and talked to everyone. I played a game of Go Fish with her as she explained all the rules and the rhymes you were supposed to say when you got a pair. She was a hoot. She also talked Mad Dog and Soot into playing with her.

The rain would taper off and then start up again with a vengeance. A few more hikers came in during the rain looking like drowned kittens. One took a bunk and the other two decided to tent. Driving rain and thunder continued all through the night. And I have to say, for a room of 14 stinky people, it was sure quiet all night. I woke several times to hear the rain pounding on the roof and thanking my lucky stars that I was under a solid roof. ","Shaker Campsite

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666198,"We were down by 5:45 for the all-you-can-eat pancakes and coffee. Breakfast was made by Fern cooking on a propane stove. She is 12 years old and told us she has been doing this for 10 years! What an amazing young lady!


We left about 7:15 and the trail was a mess. It was basically just a river with occasional downgrades to fast-moving streams. Then, just to make it interesting, you had large pits of mud to circumnavigate. It was so much fun. :(


We came to a river with boards across and a white blaze on the tree. We crossed and walked up and down several trails for 15-20 minutes unable to find another blaze. We finally returned back over the bridge and noticed the next blaze on a skinny tree parallel to the river. The bridge was just a red herring and we fell for it! Arghh!


After we got back on track we hiked for a while longer and came to a wide, fast-moving river. We went up and down both sides but could not find a way to cross without actually wading into the river. So we sat down, pulled off our boots and socks, made sure our phone & airpods & power bank were all securely in our waterproof bag inside our pack. CoffeeBean crossed first. I could see the current pulling at him buy he went slowly and made it across. I followed where he went as best I could and made it across too. A sample of Maine to come! But it was fun! (Speaking of that, we talked to a hiker that said that the ferry crossing for hikers on the Kennebec River in Maine has been closed because of how strong the ricer is flowing. Hikers have to walk around 4 miles instead and of the fun canoe crossing that they usually do.)


We finally got to the Washington Mountain Rd crossing about 4:15 and saw the signs for the Cookie Lady. We took a right and walked about .1 down the road to a pretty house surrounded by acres of blueberry bushes! Wild Berry (formerly Holly) and Pacer greeted us from the porch rocking chairs. “Cookie Son” (as we called him) came out and gave us the rundown of amenities. There were outlets to plugs in electronics and water from the hose, clothesline for wet things, port-a-potty, and, of course, a wooden box labeled “cookies”. Today’s selection was homemade chocolate chip. (They were good, but they weren’t brother Tom quality.)



The coolest thing was where you could sleep. The lawn area was huge and you could pitch a tent if you wanted. The ground was pretty soggy from all the rain so we said nah. The other choice was this great big airplane hangar! We opened the door and the place was full of furniture! Beds, mattresses, couches, tables & chairs, you name it! It was like walking into a huge house. Pacer and Wild Berry had snagged us a bed and mattress. There were also model airplanes and airplanes in various states of assembly hanging from the ceiling or laying on tables. It was so neat to see!We unpacked and then took the tent and our clothes up to the clothesline to hang. Also ate more cookies. Met a new hiker, Pink Flop, from Australia. Had a lot of fun hanging at the Cookie Lady’s!","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

I took a shower 
I have clean clothes
I have dry feet
Who could ask for anything more?!
       la   la   la


We were awaken at 1:30am by 3 hikers and their dog who wanted to leave early. Hard to be quiet in an airplane hangar. I was able to fall back to a restless sleep and by 5:30am gave up and got CoffeeBean up and going. 


After leaving a donation for the great hospitality, we headed for Dalton and clean laundry and a shower. 



The trail was still a mess. Smaller streams on the trail but more mud. There was only small ups and downs and actually some level spots. Not bad. We finally came down the mountain to Dalton. I sopped just inside the woods and put on a less stinky shirt. CoffeeBean said he would change at the motel. We crossed over railroad tracks and then turned onto the Main Street of the cutest town. They obviously take great pride in their town. The homes were very old (one had a sign that said “Built in 1801”) with big front or wraparound porches. The sidewalks were swept clean and everyone had flowers in their yard or pots. Like something out of a Jimmy Stewart movie. 


We walked down and saw Angelina’s Subs. Pacer and Wild Berry were already there. We got the best meal. A carnivore’s dream. An 8” sub called a “Cuban” with 4 kinds of meat, melted cheese, mustard and chipotle mayo. We got a big salad too and drinks. We wolfed it all down like, well, like starving hikers! 


Right next to the sub shop was our motel - the Shamrock Village Motel. It was a small, very tired, very old motel. But the manager was nice. :). It did have onsite laundry so that was a plus. We were given room #4. The sign said No Smoking in any room. We needed to dry our boots and discovered the unit in the window was an air conditioner. The heat was baseboard heating. So I cranked up the thermostat and we laid our boots against it to dry. We piled our dirty clothes on the bed and then took them to the laundry room and got them going. I took a shower first. I could just turn around in it. Very small. CoffeeBean was disappointed there was no tub. He really likes to sit and soak his  sore muscles. There was cable TV though so we watched The Office reruns. 


We had talked to Pacer and Wild Berry about meeting for dinner. (They are staying 2 days and taking a zero. A “zero” means that you hike zero miles that day. A “nero” means near-zero miles.) When they texted we asked for a rain check. We were tired and just wanted to veg out. So that’s what we did. We went nowhere else and did nothing but lay on the bed. (I did go get the dry laundry though.)


About 8:00 I went to use the bathroom and it smelled of cigarettes. We had to keep the bathroom door closed the rest of the night. Not the best place on trail, but not the worst either. We didn’t have to set up a tent and we were clean and dry. I’ll take it. ","Cookie Lady’s

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666347,"We still needed to resupply so we started hitchhiking to the Walmart 1-1/2 miles away. First time my “golden thumb” (as CoffeeBean calls it) didn’t get us a ride. We got to Walmart, did our shop, and called for a shuttle. It was $10 for the both of us but is was better than walking back with all the groceries. 


We got onto trail about 10:35 and it was in such better shape than the last few days. It seemed to finally be drying up a bit so we were making a little better time. 



The weather was nice just vey humid. We arrived in Cheshire about 3:30 and found Father Tom’s Campsite not far from the trailhead. Father Tom was a local priest who began hosting AT hikers almost as soon as he took over ministry of St Mary’s of the Assumption in Cheshire, MA. He section hiked the AT (trail name Father Time), completing it on Sept 4, 1995. He was active in all the hiking organizations in the area and was a volunteer Maintainer of a 4 mile section of the AT. He passed away on Dec 2, 2018 and the church found it could no longer host hikers. So the Cheshire Appalachian Trail Community members created this campsite in Fr Tom’s memory. 

The campsite is a large grassy area for tents and several post set up for hangers (folks that hammock). They also had put out 2 picnic tables, chairs, and a cool bike shed. There were 3 bikes hanging in it for hikers to ride into town. There was also electricity, a porta-potty, bear box, trash cans, and a washing/water station. They thought of everything. 
We met a couple from Utah (No Complaints and her husband Time and a Half) that had retired in December and decided to thru-hike. Of course, CoffeeBean was in seventh heaven talking about Utah. While he did that, and worked on making dinner, I walked across the street to Diane’s Twists, and got an ice cream cone. Every time we would go into town I said I wanted to get ice cream and it didn’t happen. So I made it happen this time! :)


We ate dinner and were in our tent resting by 5:55pm. Tomorrow is a BIG climb up to Mt Greylock, the highest mountain in Massachusetts. Elevation is 3491’

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666348,"We got up at 5:20am. The morning was very foggy, dewy, misty. Take your pick. The tent was wet. We had to dry it as best we could with our camp towel. 


Today is a big climb - 980’ to 3491’. David made a hot breakfast while I packed the tent away. Then we got on trail at 6:35. I had put rain pants on thinking the meadow we had to go through initially would soak my pants. It didn’t. Instead I started sweating so I stopped, pulled off my pack , dug out my hiking pants, then unhooked my gaiters, untied my boots, changed pants, put gaiters back on, tied boots, and hooked up gaiters. Along process just to change pants. Next time I’ll let them get wet. :)


We were pleasantly surprised that the climb ip was not as bad as we feared or as bad as it looked on my Guthook app. There were still patches of mud to traverse but it is getting better. Every now and then we would walk through an area and the smell of pine and balsam would be so delicious. We would breathe deeply when we hit those spots. 


I set a better pace now that we are starting to acquire our hiker legs so I usually lead. Today we were going downhill getting near a road crossing and CoffeeBean yelled “Hey, did you not see the trail magic?” I went back and someone had left 2 cans of A&W Root Beer and a can of YooHoo. And they were still cold! CoffeeBean sucked down the YooHoo before I could grab it and I ended up getting the last 2 swigs. We took the other 2 to have for lunch as we were almost to the summit of Mt Greylock. 


Another mile and we came out on the top of the summit. What a view! The first thing you see is this giant tower built as a war memorial to all the Massachusetts soldiers  that died during the world war (the first). The top of the tower is like a glass globe or orb and it shines a light at night that can be seen for 90 miles. You can climb all the way to the top and we did. In each direction there was a plaque stating what you could see on a clear day but the smoke from the Canadian fires made the view very murky. In the center of the tower, on the ground floor, is a large plaque that has US with a torch between the letters. There were also beautiful poetic phases written around the circular room. We were very awed by it all. 


We went out to the large lawn area. Other people had spread out blankets and were eating lunch while their children ran around on the grass playing. We dropped our packs, spread out out our wet tent and gear, ate lunch, and then leaned against our packs and snoozed for a bit. Not your typical tourists. :)



The hike down wasn’t bad at all. We hiked to the Wilbur Clearing Shelter, with a .3 mile hike in to the shelter! And that mileage doesn’t count as AT miles. So at the end of this 2,194 mile trip there are a LOT more miles hiked than that. 
So we did 11.7 miles today. Our average mileage the first week on trail was 9.3 miles/day. We are working to increase our daily mileage the second week on trail to 10-11. So far, so good. ","Father Tom’s Campsite

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666408,"We set up our tent last night on a platform and were able to stake the guy lines on the rain tarp just in case it rained during the night but it didn’t. Yay!


We left at 6:35. That seems to be our new time which makes for a shorter day, in a way. We still hike 8-10 hours a day but end sooner in the day. 


Just before the trailhead that took us into West Adams, MA, we came to a nice stream with a bridge. We stopped and filtered water. Then a few yards down the trail we came to a cooler with about 8 gallons of fresh water. Argh! We wouldn’t have had to filter if we had seen that. Oh well. 


We walked a short distance and saw 2 potato chip bags sitting on a log. Someone had written “You’ve been bacon wrapped”. We laughed and tore into those chips! In our heads we thanked the trail angel named “Bacon Wrapped”. 


We walked through West Adams, stopping for a quick break on the school steps. Then we saw an AT community news board with 3 coolers under it labelled “For AT hikers only”. One had water, one had snacks, and one had supplies (soap, bandaids, ibuprofen, etc). We grabbed a couple “vitamin i” (ibuprofen) and swallowed them. 


In 4.1 miles we came to the VT border! Actually there was a sign that said “You are entering Massachusetts” and then about 20’ from there was a sign that said “Welcome to Vermont”. There were 3 people sitting on a rock on the land in between and said they were in no man’s land. We all laughed at that. Those folks were seeing their 20-something year old daughter, Ruby, who was off to hike the Long Trail (a trail that runs 272 miles through Vermont to the Canadian border). 


 My first impression of Vermont was the huge boulders. Everywhere! Second was the lousy trail maintenance. At times we felt like we were bushwhacking the trail. Overgrown branches across the trail, trees that had fallen across the trail that we had to climb over or around. And, of course, the trail itself. The only way to identify the trail was to look for the raging stream of water 6-18” deep and the sucking mud. There was NO place to step that wasn’t underwater. 



There was a shelter called the Seth Warner Shelter but they tore that one down and moved it 2.7 miles north so we were headed to the new one. We were disappointed when we got there. We had hoped to tent but the area was covered in downed trees and branches and tree stumps. The new shelter was very nice. It was completed enough to sleep in but had boards stacked against the back wall for completing the rest. There was no picnic table or tent platforms (which would definitely be needed because the land around the shelter is all sloped). The privy looked really snazzy with a little porch and railing. Then when I went to use it. I had to walk around a huge mud puddle, of course, and then the door only opened about a foot because it didn’t hang correctly. Once I closed it and put the hook on to lock it closed, the door was cracked open about 4”, enough so that anyone walking by or waiting to use the privy had a clear view of me on the pot. Hmm. Not so impressed with this new privy after all. 
Ruby was already at the shelter when we got there and slowly more folks began showing up. A shelter made for 6-8 people was holding 9 by night. 


Hiking was harder today than yesterday but we still did 12.55 miles.","Wilbur Clearing Campsite

Happy Feet and CoffeeBean ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666444,"The rain, which wasn’t supposed to start until 8:30am, began in the middle of the night. We had planned to get up as usual at 5am-ish and be on the trail by 6:30 to get some miles behind us before the rain started. When we woke to the rain still poring down, most of us just kept on sleeping. One couple left early but the rest of us hoped the rain would taper off at some point. (BTW, it turned out that of the 9 people in the shelter, we were the only 2 doing the AT. The rest were hiking the Long Trail to Canada.) We had no service at the shelter so we couldn’t check the weather. 
We finally left at 10:35am when the rain slowed just a little. Soon after it began pouring down again in earnest. I can’t even begin to describe how awful the trail was. Some parts were constant flowing rivers. Other parts were standing deep pools of water and mud. Sometimes there were stones in the middle on which to balance but rarely were there enough to get you all the way through the river. We just did our best to try and walk along the trail but there was no where else to walk. Our boots were completely saturated and the rain never let up so we were soaked to the skin too. 


At a point I was able to check for service and had enough bars to call the town of Bennington to a motel called the Catamount, a hiker favorite on Guthook. I was so sure they would be full because of the weather but they had a room. They said to call when we reached Harmon Hill, where we would have service again. From that point it was 1.8 miles to the trailhead, where there was no service. They would give us an hour and 10 minutes to reach the trailhead where a shuttle to the motel would be waiting. But the shuttle did not run at night. So we had 6.8 miles to get to Harmon Hill. 


We started hiking as fast as was possible for us. We came down an incline and turned to continue down the trail. There were branches across part of the trail but a path to walk so we did. After 15-20 minutes we could not find any blazes. (It was hard finding blazes anyways because of the rain and mist.) I checked the map on Guthook and found we were on an ATV trail not the AT! We turned around and hiked back to where we came in then continued on the foot path but we didn’t verify the direction! Shame on us! We hiked another 20-30 minutes following the blazes. Then CoffeeBean made the comment that this area around the pond seemed familiar and after checking the map we realized we were hiking south! Back in the direction of the shelter that we had left!! At that point, I lost it and started crying. There was no way we were going to be able to hike 6.8 miles to the top of Harmon Hill and then 1.8 to the trailhead before dark. I prayed a lot over the hours, in between bouts of tears over the shitty trail. 


We hiked as fast as we could and it took until 5:15pm to get to Harmon Hill. I made the call to the Catamount and asked for an hour and 20 minutes before the shuttle picked us up and they said sure. 


CoffeeBean had hiked on while I made the call. I caught up and said we were on and had an hour and 20 minutes. Then I fell. I tripped on a tree root and went down onto my wrist and side. When I was able to get to my knees I realized that I had caught myself from falling onto a pointed rock just below my left collarbone. My hands and chest hurt but I kept going. The second fall hurt more and I cut my knee good. The third fall made my hands and wrists hurt. 


We finally started down the hill towards the trailhead. It was a hands and feet boulder scramble all the way down. Huge boulders. Some were like steps bit others were tilted downwards so we had to be careful not to slide on them. Not always successful at that. CoffeeBean was 5 minutes from the bottom when he slid on a rock and went down hard! I was afraid that he had broken his wrist because he was holding it. He said it was sore but his leg was gashed pretty bad. We got down the hill in an hour and 15 minutes. Five minutes to spare!


We were picked up by a super nice guy named Allen. (He and his wife used to own the motel but he said that it got to be too much so they sold it to Pete. Now they just come in the summers to help out.) Allen showed us where things in town were. I told him that we were taking a zero day tomorrow. 


I wonder if I will ever be dry or warm again. Now I understand why Vermont is referred to as Vermud. The trail in this state really sucks. It is not a trail. Just a river with no trail maintenance.

Talked to other hikers who said that the ferry across the Kennebec River in Maine was closed due to high and dangerous water. We also heard that hikers waiting at the kiosk to sign in to get a campsite in Baxter State Park (before climbing up Katahdin) were standing in water above waist high! One of the bridges that hikers have to cross to get to Abol in Maine is now underwater. The bridge is normally 15 feet above the water. The rain and water this year is unprecedented. 


We called my brother, Tom, for a ride back to his house. The falls we took have us really concerned about injuries. Cuts and bruises are one thing but if we broke anything it would take much longer to recover from. We don’t want to do something that would keep us from hiking into our 70’s and 80’s. We can wait for drier weather and so we will. 


We’ve done 110.5 miles this trip and will keep chipping away at it. Thank you for following us and supporting us. We love you all. ",,View Entry,"Jul 03, Mon",0
