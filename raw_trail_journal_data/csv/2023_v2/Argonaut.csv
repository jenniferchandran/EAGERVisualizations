Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661138,"With only a few days left before I begin my hike, I thought now would be as good a time as any to write up my first entry.When I tell people about this trip, one of the most common questions I get is ""why?"" It's usually either why am I doing something like this in general or why did I specifically choose to do the Appalachian Trail as opposed to something else? The second question is easier to answer, so I'll do that one first.
I chose to hike the Appalachian Trail because, at least to my ignorant mind, it's not something that requires a lot of technical skill to accomplish. There are some logistical challenges to be sure, but if you can put one foot in front of the other and can pitch a tent, then there isn't much else required to be successful. However, despite the technical simplicity, the extreme distance, rugged terrain, and limited time frame make the actual difficulty much greater. I've read that out of all the people who attempt a thru-hike, only about 20 - 25% actually complete it. This should give you an idea of the challenge involved.
The first question is a little bit more difficult to answer. Mainly because I haven't completely figured it out yet, but also because there isn't just a single reason. One reason, and probably the biggest contributor is that it's something different than what I'm doing now. I don't know this as fact, but I suspect that most people at one point or another fall into life ruts. They are more or less doing the same thing in the same general location day in and day out and that kind of thing can take a mental toll on a person. Most people my age are married with kids, so they have to find other less intrusive ways to manage those ruts. They try new restaurants or take up hobbies. They go on vacations or just do something so that not every day feels like the day before. The benefit of not having a spouse or kids is that I can do something much bigger... like take off six months from work to go hiking.
This can't be my only reason though, because if it was, I don't think I would have a good chance of succeeding and making it to Katahdin. If this was all the motivation that I had, then once the newness of the experience wore off (which might be within the first 24 hours if the current weather forecast at Springer Mountain holds), I wouldn't have any reason to continue. So, I'm also doing this for the challenge itself. I think it's human nature to want to have something that can be looked back upon with a sense of accomplishment whether it's kids, a business, a cause, or something else. We all want to know that we did something meaningful with our lives. For me, right now, I just want to be able to say that I undertook this incredibly difficult task and through grit and determination I was able to accomplish what I set out to do. 
And while I am mostly doing this for myself, I also do hope that it inspires other people as well. For example, I have a niece that I absolutely adore. She's young now so, relatively speaking, she doesn't have much in life to worry about. But, I hope that someday when life truly does get difficult, she can find at least a tiny bit of solace or inspiration in my own experience.
There are other reasons, both conscious and unconscious, for this trip, but they are relatively small compared to the above I think. Despite my best intentions, there's no guarantee that I will be able to make it all the way to Maine. Of the 75-80% that don't make it, most quit because of either injury, family emergency, or some other unforeseen and uncontrollable circumstance. However, I believe that I can confidently say that if I do quit, it won't be because I just don't want to do it anymore.",,View Entry,"Mar 23, Thu",0
Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661241,"Tomorrow is the big day. The plan is to get up around 6:30am, eat breakfast at the hotel and get to the trail by 8:00am. The goal for the day is Black Gap, which is about 7 miles from the beginning of the trail and about a mile from Springer Mountain and the beginning of the Appalachian Trail.
With all that said, and despite my words of confidence from my last entry, I would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous now. I don't really know how best to describe what I'm feeling but the closest analogy that I can think of is a person who quits their job, changes careers, and moves to a completely new city.
I've tried to prepare as best as possible, but I'm not an experienced backpacker and I don't know what I don't know. Am I in good enough shape? Is my pack too heavy? Do I have all the right equipment? These questions and lots of others swirl in the back of my mind and it does take some effort to not get overwhelmed and allow self-doubt to creep in.I know these feelings are natural and I know the thousands of people who have done this before me have felt similar things, but when you're the one experiencing it, that knowledge is cold comfort. But, the die has been cast and the only move now is forward. On to tomorrow.",,View Entry,"Mar 25, Sat",0
Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661261,"The first hiking day is in the bag. I started at the famous Amicalola Arc and went about 7 miles to Black Gap Shelter.
The first obstacle was about a half a mile from the arc. In order to get to the top of Amicalola Falls and continue on the AT approach trail, you have to climb 604 steps. It was difficult,  but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I had read that it was the most difficult part of the trail, but I would disagree. About 3 to 4 miles on the trail, I began an ascent. It wasn't as steep as the stairs and I'm sure it was only a half-mile or so, but it felt like it went on forever. I was also starting to get fairly fatigued by this point, so that only made it harder.
But, I made it and all things considered,  I couldn't have asked for a better day to start. The temperature was in the high 50s to low 60s the entire time. It was mostly overcast, so I didn't have the sun beating down on me, and it only sprinkled rain a couple of times. Earlier in the week the forecast called for much worse, so I'm thankful for that. I'll have plenty of terrible weather days ahead. I didn't need to start out with one.
Black Gap itself is relatively decent. It's basically just an elevated platform with three walls and a roof. If I had to guess, I'd say you can fit six or seven people side by side comfortably. 
The one drawback is that the water source is a little far away. It's about 1/4 of a mile and it's fairly steep on the way down. That means it's fairly steep on the way back up. Not ideal after just having hiked for 7 miles. But I didn't have to do it with a pack, so silver linings.
When I got here, there wasn't anyone else here yet except one other guy who hiked on. Since then it's started to get a little busier. There are about seven people spread out over the area now.
I did make a couple of rookie mistakes on my first day. The first is that I forgot my toothbrush bag at the hotel we stayed at I Alpharetta last night. I probably won't be able to get a new one for at least three days. So that's gross.
Second, I didn't check my electronics before starting. If I had, I would have noticed that my GPS device got turned on inside my pack. It died pretty quickly on the trail. Fortunately I was able to get it charged back up with my power pack, but there is a gap in my trail tracking.
I don't know what my destination is for tomorrow yet. But, it'll be around the 8 mile mark again. That's the limit I've set for myself for the first week while I get my trail legs.
Breakfast: Hotel food. Eggs, 4 pork sausages,  a bowl of oatmeal with about a tablespoon of brown sugar and a tablespoon of granola, and a carton of chocolate milk.
Snack 1: A handful of Second Nature Keto Crunch snack mix.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661305,"So I'm going to get this out of the way.
I woke up, ate a pretty terrible breakfast, and was on the trail by about 7am. It stormed pretty bad the night before and sunrise was around 7:30. So, it was dark, foggy, and a little cool and it was also a little rainy. But once I got moving on the trail, it was actually pretty comfortable. 
So there I am trucking along at a pretty nice pace when I get about a mile and a half in. I get to this clearing and I see this plague sticking out of the ground. It looked very similar to the same plaque I saw on the way to Black Gap the day before. Further investigation revealed that it was identical.  Now this would have immediately raised some red flag in a normal person, but I actually walked about another 200 feet before I pulled out my phone and realized I had just walked south for about an hour. Now as I'm sure many of you know, Maine is north of Georgia, not south. It was a real gut punch and put an extra 3 hours and about 3 miles onto today's trip.
With all that said, I got myself turned around and made it to the shelter. I'm now also officially on the Appalachian Trail (the first 8ish miles was the approach trail).
The shelter area here is a bit more lively than last nights. I think there are probably more people, but I also think quite a few people skip the approach trail and go straight to Springer Mountain.
Breakfast: Backpackers Pantry Breakfast Skillet.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661356,"No major hiccups this time. Though you can bet that five minutes after I left the shelter I had my phone out checking to make sure I was going in the right direction. I did leave my phone on the battery pack overnight so it did drain it more than I would have liked. In the future, I'm going to journal if I can, charge the phone, then turn it off for the night.
Last night was fairly interesting. A fire was built and most of the people at the site sat around and talked until about 9pm. Inappropriate jokes and one liners were told, laughter was had. It was a great time. 
I also found out that the Army Rangers have a training camp nearby when aat about 8 or so a bunch of automatic weapon fire rang out through the mountain.  Then, at about 1am, a loud explosion went off with another one following several minutes later. Fortunately I was already awake because I still haven't gotten a nice sleeping schedule down yet. Though it was better than the previous night.
The first 3.25 miles this morning were pretty brutal. There were a lot of ups and downs. There was one section that I later found out was called Sassafras mountain and it was a very steep incline and I don't know the distance, but it probably took about 30 minutes to finally get to the top. Once I got to Coopers Gap, I refilled at a water buffalo (a giant tank filled with potable water) and the rest of the trail was relatively flat with just a couple of small inclines and declines. Though by the time I got to the Gooch Gap Shelter I was pretty exhausted. 
I also did IT for the first time. If you know, then you know. If you don't then just think about what a person who has never done backcountry hiking before might do for the first time and it shouldn't take too much imagination to figure out. Nothing more needs to be said, but I wanted to mark the occasion for future posterity.
I did make one other slight mistake. I thought that I miscalculated the amount of food that I needed before my first resupply because I didn't think the website I used took into account the 8 mile approach trail. So, I skipped breakfast this morning. Once I got to Gooch Gap, I did an inventory of my food and skipping breakfast was unnecessary. 
Breakfast: None
Snack 1: Snickerdoodle protein cookie. I'm not sure if I'll get this again. I had to drink about half of liter of water as I was chewing it in order to be able to swallow it.
Snack 2: A couple handfuls of Second Nature Keto Crunch Snack Mix. I've gotten this before and it's pretty good. I do wish it was a little sweeter though.
Dinner: Peak Refuel Chicken Alfredo Pasta. It was good, but a little too watery.","Hawk Mountain Shelter 
",Gooch Gap Shelter,"Mar 28, Tue",7.80
Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661357,"Last night at the shelter was another fun one. At one point a group of people tried to start up a poker game using snacks as betting chips. They tried to rate each type of snack based on its desirability. After all it would be fair if someone threw in a candy bar and someone else called with a shitty protein cookie. About the only thing the could agree on was that a Snickers was definitely a tier 4 item. There were also several people who didn't know how to play poker at all. By the time we did a practice round, it started getting too dark to see the cards so we ended up calling it a night.
I got started on the trail pretty early because I knew I would be hiking a longer distance today. Tomorrow is Blood Mountain, which is a steep and long uphill climb followed by steep and long downhill climb. I wanted to get to the closest shelter possible so that my legs would be as fresh. The good thing is that it's going to be a short 4 mile or so hike to Neel Gap which is my first resupply point. I'm going to try and rent a cabin for the night if any are available. 
The hike itself was long but pretty manageable. There was a pretty steep climb just past Woody Gap, but I was rewarded with one of the best views I've had so far. It was a giant rock outcrop and you could see out over the mountains for miles. It was beautiful. 
Tonight I'm staying at Woods Hole. It's probably my least favorite shelter so far. You have to take a trail that is almost a half a mile backwards from the main trail and the water source is a real pain to access. The main flow is low to the ground and it's about six inches back under a rock. It's better than nothing, but not great.
Breakfast: Mountain House scrambled eggs with uncured bacon. It's not terrible, but it has the same issue that some of the other meals that I've had. It asks for too much water and I end up having to drink my eggs. You're not supposed to drink eggs.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661498,"There weren't as many people at this shelter as the last couple of nights. I think it's probably because of the distance from the trail and the requirement to have a bear canister to stay there. It didn't get as rambunctious as before but it wasn't uneventful either.
Starting at about 6:30 or so, smoke started rolling into the area. By sunset, it completely blanketed the valley and turned the sun blood red. It was definitely a fire, but we weren't sure whether it was from a controlled burn or a wildfire. We checked some internet sites, but couldn't find anything definitive. I did try to get a picture of the red sun, but it didn't turn out well at all. We did worry that the smoke would make the view atop Blood Mountain the next day worthless, but it was gone by morning.
The weather was pretty cold overnight. I don't know the exact temperature,  but I think it was in the mid to low 30s. I know I woke up a few times shivering pretty good. The quilt I have is nice, but I haven't figured out how to deal with cold drafts yet.
The hike today was short, only about 5 miles, but it still did a number on me. The ascent was close to 1000 miles in a little over a mile. It actually wasn't too bad. There were a couple of spots that felt like climbing stairs, but most of it was pretty gradual so it felt more like just walking uphill. The view from the top was amazing. Blood Mountain is the third highest point in Georgia and the highest point in Georgia on the AT. It makes me wish I had a quality camera that I knew how to use because the pictures I take with my phone don't capture the spectacle at all. The decent from Blood Mountain was a totally different story. It was about 1400 feet over a distance of a little over two miles. The majority of it was on straight Rock. No grass or dirt paths at all so my feet took quite a beating.
But it did get me to Neels Gap and my first resupply point. I'm renting a cabin for the night and have already gotten a nice meal, a shower which felt amazing and finally a toothbrush and toothpaste so I'm no longer walking around with a literal dirty mouth.The cabin was pretty nice, but after sleeping on an air mattress for the past four nights, it probably wouldn't take more than a nice bed to impress me. It is supposed to sleep six (4 adults and 2 children). It had a small downstairs bedroom with a queen bed, a small living room area with a pull out sofa bed, a little kitchen, and a loft upstairs that had another queen bed. I completely forgot to get a picture of it.I met up with the group of hikers that tried to play poker with snacks at Gooch Gap. They were also renting a cabin at the same place. After I ate dinner, I ended up hanging out in their cabin for the rest of the evening. We even got to play some actual poker using M&Ms.

",Neel Gap,"Mar 30, Thu",5.30
Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661504,"I had to suspend journaling for a few days because I needed to conserve my phone's battery. I forgot to pack a USB outlet adapter, so I had no way of charging my electronics. I was hoping Mountain Crossing at Neel Gap would have one, but they didn't have the right kind I needed. I'm at a place where I can get everything charged, so I'm retroactively filling in the last few entries.
The stay at the cabin was very pleasant. It was nice to sleep in a bed after having slept on an air mattress for the past four nights. The small kitchen also gave me an opportunity to eat something other than a meal that required just adding water.
Leaving Neel Gap, the plan was to hike and stay at the Whitley Gap Shelter. I was aware that it was over a mile off-trail, but I figured since I was already trying to hike over 2,000 miles, a few extra wouldn't hurt. Also, the FarOut comments for the location said there usually weren't many people there and it had a good water flow. Only one of those things turned out to be true.
The thing I didn't find out until it was too late was that there was about a 3/4 of a mile stretch that had a pretty significant decline. This would mean that I would also have a pretty significant incline on the way out the next morning. And I didn't even get the solitude that the comments talked about. When I got there, there we already 4 people in the shelter that sleeps 7 and by evening it was full along with several tents. One factor that probably contributed to the number of people was the forecast for severe thunderstorms that night.

The flow at the water source was excellent though, probably the best I'd seen to that point and the company was nice. I met a hiker who came all the way from Portugal to hike the AT. I also met a volunteer that was not a fan of trail magic. Especially those who did elaborate setups like cook hamburgers or something of that nature. I don't know the exact reason, but I got the impression that he thought it took away from the wilderness experience. Personally, I think people who do that sort of thing contribute just as much to the AT experience as the trail volunteers who maintain the trails and shelters do. Hiking the AT is really hard and coming across a person or a group of people who are willing to feed you a decent meal can be a really great spirit lifter.
Breakfast: I had bought two frozen Jimmy Dean sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit sandwiches the night before, but I only ate one of them. They weren't terrible, but they weren't that good either.
Lunch: A tortilla with peanut butter and honey. It was good, but I wish I had a banana to go with it.
Dinner: Peak Refuel Chicken Coconut Curry. This was my favorite so far. It made me want to try the authentic version of it.","Neel Gap

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661510,"Today was a doozy for a couple of reasons. It was my longest distance traveled so far and the first couple of hours I was hiking in pouring rain with the occasional lightning storm.I woke up very early and the forecasted storm for the night seemed to have never materialized, so I figured I'd get an early start. I woke up at about 0330 and was on the trail by about 0545. Apparently the storm that was supposed to hit the night before decided to wait until about 0615 to start. By the time I had climbed out of the gap, the rain was so bad that my headlamp was next to useless. Like the first morning on the trail, the dark and low visibility also caused me to get turned around again, but fortunately I realized it much sooner this time. It also got so bad that at one point I just stopped and stood for about 5-10 minutes until the rain let up enough so that I could tell where I was going.There was a point about an hour or so later where I thought the storm might be over because the rain had let up significantly, but about 15 minutes later it started all over again. By this time, it was past sunrise though, so I could at least tell where I was going. It was finally about 9 or 10 when the storm passed and about an hour after that the sun came out. So, overall I hiked in the rain for around 3 to 4 hours. The rest of the hike, after I dried out, was very pleasant though socks stayed wet until I got to the shelter. All in all, it wasn't a terrible experience. The temperature was high enough that I never felt cold and there were only a few times where I really started getting concerned about the lightning. I'd prefer it didn't happen again, but if that's the worst I have to deal with then I'll be grateful for it.The conditions at the shelter, once I finally got there, were non-ideal in its own way. I'm glad I got there in time to get the last shelter space because there were frequent gusts of wind that had to be in the 30-40 mph range. It wasn't impossible to set up a tent, there were several people who did, but it did make it more difficult.There was also a boy scout group at the shelter area. I got to talking with them for a little bit and they were hiking around the area for a few days in order to prepare for a two week backpacking trip to somewhere in New Mexico I think. The scout leader told me, but I can't remember the name. I think it started with an F. It was a little amusing watching them try to start a fire so they could boil a pot of water with the high winds. They had some sort of gas tank that was attached to a tube which was then attached to the burner. They had to pressurize the canister using some sort of pump while they tried to light it. Meanwhile,  the wind was making it very difficult and when they would finally get it lit, a gust of wind would blow the flame out and they'd have to do the whole thing over again. But, they eventually got it and a lot of them had a Backpackers staple dinner of instant Ramen.Breakfast: Peak Refuel Breakfast Skillet. This was the first one from this brand that I wasn't a fan of. Part of it might have been because I added less than the amount of water called for. All the other freeze dried meals that had eggs seemed to ask for too much water, so I figured this would be the same. But, I think it's probably more the fact that it's not possible to make good rehydrated eggs period.Snack: 2 handfuls of Second Nature Keto Crunch Snack Mix. Lunch: A tortilla with peanut butter and honey. Dinner: Peak Refuel Chicken Pesto Pasta.

I was on the trail by 6 because I wanted to get into town as soon as possible. I'm doing a back-to-back nero (near zero miles) and zero day. It was a little over 2 miles to get to Unicoi Gap. From there I hitched into Helen, GA where I'm going to stay until Tuesday. A real nice lady picked me up after about 10 minutes of walking toward Helen and I'm really glad she did because as we were driving i realized that the walk would not have been fun if I had had to do the whole thing on foot.I didn't do much of note.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661573,"Today was zero day in Helen, GA. After getting breakfast around 7, I spent most of the morning in my room just relaxing. Most of the town doesn't start opening up until 10.
It did rain a little bit, but it wasn't too bad. It also didn't take me as long to explore the main part of the town as I thought it would. I'd say the main drag is maybe about a mile long, so it only took about 30-45 minutes to walk from one end to the other. It's pretty touristy. There are a lot of restaurants and little gitchy shops up and down the road. Google did show a few interesting locations a little outside of town, for instance there's some kind of burial mound and a castle. But, they were a little further away than I wanted to walk, so after getting some lunch, I just made my way back to my room and relaxed some more before dinner.
I did make a purchase at the grocery store that I may end up regretting. At the Blue Mountain Shelter, the topic of fruit came up and I mentioned how nice it would be if someone had pulled out a whole pineapple. People seemed to relish the idea, so while I didn't get a pineapple (I was afraid no one would have anything to cut it with), I did pick up a small bag of oranges. Unfortunately that small bag weighs about 3 lbs, which is just more weight I have to carry. Still, tomorrow is a short distance to the shelter and hopefully there are enough people there who like oranges that I can get rid of them all before the next days hike.
But, it's close to turning in time. Tomorrow is back to the trail and a few more miles closer to Maine.
Breakfast: A banana, some Quaker Brown Sugar and Maple Oatmeal, a cup of OJ, and a carton of chocolate milk at the hotel.
Lunch: Gulasch at The Heidelburg. A spicy Hungarian-style stew of beef and pork, spätzle, onions, peppers, tomatoes and potatoes. I thought this was really good. I also got a side of red cabbage. I knew it was a gamble, because I've had it before and didn't care for it, but wanted to see if my tastes had changed. They have not. I can't find the receipt,  but I think it was around $20.00 with tip.
Dinner: Schweinbraten. Slow-roasted pork served with a Rahm gravy, roasted potatoes, and carrots. This is a meal that if I went to someone's house and they were serving it, I would eat it and enjoy it, but I wouldn't order it at a restaurant again. At least not this one. The main problem I had with it is that I thought there was way too much salt in everything. $21.40 with tip.
Dessert: A piece of rum trufle torte from Hofer's Bakery and Cafe. It was good, but I was surprised by the texture. It was a lot more airy than I was expecting and it was a little dry. I'd get it again though and would love to try their other tortes. $8.30","

I had a pretty difficult time on the second uphill and had to stop several times.I'd be lying if I said I didn't get a little discouraged.

Then Kelly Knob happened and it completely wiped me out. It was another one of those climbs that just seemed to go on forever. I'd think I was almost done, but I'd round a bend and up it went some more. I definitely had to stop several times and it made the last 4 miles of my hike almost unbearable. There were a couple of times in that last stretch that I just had to sit down for a while. I'm wondering if maybe I'm not getting enough calories, because I don't feel sore, I just feel exhausted.

Getting exhausted on an 11.6 mile hike just feels better than getting exhausted on a 5.6. I am going to try increasing my milage a little bit. I've been aiming for the 8-10 mile range since I started and I'm going to see about pushing it to 10-12.Tonight I'm staying at the Around the Bend Hostel which is just off the trail from Dick's Creek Gap about 0.6 miles. I missed the shuttle, so I did have to walk the extra distance along the road. It was mostly flat though, so it wasn't too terrible. The hostel itself is pretty nice. There's a common area, some rooms with beds, a shed that acts as a resupply point, and a separate building that has more beds. The resupply shed is surprisingly well stocked for being so small. The room I rented sleeps three I think, but I have it to myself which is nice. It was the only one available when I booked, but I'd rather pay a little extra to have a room to myself. Breakfast: Mountain House Scrambled Eggs with Bacon.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661809,"*I tried to update this the day of, but even though I had reception at camp, it wasn't good enough to let me log in. Then my phone got wet (details in that days entry) and wouldn't turn on. Fortunately after it dried out it started working again, but these next few entries are made with a fuzzy memory. 
Today was probably the most mentally taxing day that I've had yet. I don't know if terrain wise it was the most difficult, but after a while I just stopped caring and every step seemed to take an extra amount of effort. I'm not sure what it was, but almost the entire day I was walking with this constant morose feeling hanging over me. It was the first time I seriously questioned whether or not I wanted to be doing this.
Making it to the GA/NC border did perk me up a little bit, but that didn't last long. My reward for getting to North Carolina was another slog up a steep mountain that I had to stop several times to reach the top followed by what seemed like an even steeper climb (This is where my memory is a little fuzzy. I know the climbs were steep and they sucked, but I don't remember the details. I tried using the AT Guide and the FarOut app to get an idea of the incline, but they don't seem to make it out to be as bad as I remember.)
I finally made it to the shelter at around 6:30 or so. By that time all the spaces in the shelter had been taken, so I had to setup my tent. Unfortunately all the good tent spaces had also been taken. I did manage to find a relatively flat area, but it's at a bit of an incline, so sleeping tonight isn't going to be the most comfortable. 
I think the novelty of this whole experience has worn off. Time also feels so much different than when I'm back home. It's only been about two weeks since I started, but it feels like I've been out here for two months. That makes it really hard to manage expectations. Because it seems like I've been out here so long, I have this idea of how far along I should be. But when I stop to actually look, I'm nowhere near where my brain is telling me I should be. I'm also not getting my trail legs as fast as I want, which leads to further frustration when I have to stop all the time to rest. 
I'm going to stop in Franklin, NC in a few days to rest and resupply. I'm also going to take the time to reevaluate whether or not I really want to do this.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661817,"Today did not start out great. My air mattress got a hole in it a few days ago, so when I was at Around the Bend I sent it home and bought a foam sleeping pad to try out. I think I should have tried fixing the hole instead. It also didn't help that I was laying at an angle so I really didn't get a good nights sleep.I think it was around 6:30am when I got everything packed up and started the days hike. About 30 minutes later it started raining. It was still raining when I stopped to take a break about 4 miles later at the Standing Indian shelter. Up to this point I was still feeling pretty depressed like I was yesterday. But after I began walking that feeling started to go away. It wasn't until about 11:30am that the rain finally stopped and throughout the rest of the day the sun never really came out so I never really had the chance to dry off. It was during this period where I discovered that either my phone wasn't actually water resistant or it wasn't water resistant enough. It had been in my leg pocket, but it had rained so much that I was completely soaked through. When I took it out to see where I was at, it was turned off and it wouldn't turn back on. I can't say that I panicked, but it was concerning. The FarOut app was a very useful tool for figuring out where shelters, water sources, and other points of interest were located. It was also how I was making entries in this journal and keeping in touch with family so that they knew I was doing okay. So, it was a tool that I didn't want to be without.When I finally got to the shelter, it was about 3:30pm. There was only one other person there and it was a guy that I had met and gotten to know a little bit from shelters before. His trail name is Cruz. I usually wake up and hit the trail before him, but he's a much faster hiker and always manages to catch up and pass me pretty quick. He let me use his phone so that I could let my family know the situation and get a hotel reservation for Franklin setup. Then I just set my phone out and hoped when it dried out it would start working again. If not, then I would have to see about getting a new one in Franklin. When I got to the shelter I changed into mostly dry clothes which was nice. I've laid my wet clothes out to dry, but without the sun I don't think it's going to do much good which means I'm probably hiking in wet clothes tomorrow. It's also supposed to get pretty cold tonight and I think it's supposed to rain again tomorrow as well. That's life on the trail sometimes I guess.Breakfast: Peak Refuel Strawberry and Granola. This was the first cold rehydrated meal I've had. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. Apparently it's just really hard to make a good freeze dried breakfast of any kind. Still, it was decent enough that I'll probably eat it again at some point.Trail Magic: There was a very nice older couple at mile 85 (I'm guessing at the location based on the AT guide) that was handing out Easter bags to hikers. It had some grapes, an orange, a box of raisins, a hard boiled egg, and some assorted candy. I ate the fruit immediately and saved the rest for later.I didn't eat anything else until I got to the shelter. Being wet and cold just made me want to keep walking.Recovery Drink: 8 scoops of Carnation Instant Breakfast Dinner: Knorr Taco Rice with a packet of white meat chicken. This is the second time I've had the Knorr rice packets and I thought this one was pretty good also, especially with the added chicken. I didn't make it like the packet said, instead I just poured boiling water into it and let it sit for about 15 minutes. I also snacked throughout the rest of the day on the dried fruit mix to help make up some of the calories I didn't eat earlier.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661831,"To quote Charles Dickens, ""it was the best of times, it was the worst of times...""
I think it started raining again around 2:30am and it was still raining when I finally managed to convince myself to get up and get moving at around 8:00am. The combination of the rain, the wind, and knowing my hiking clothes were still wet did not really motivate me to start as early as I normally would. By the time I got a quick breakfast, got packed up, and on the trail it was around 9:00am or so. And it was still raining. 
After I got moving though I started to warm up and was actually feeling pretty good. Fortunately, a lot of the hike was on pretty level ground so even though it rained all day, I was able to move relatively quickly. There were really only two difficult sections. The first was about 6 miles from the Carter Gap Shelter. It was up Albert Mountain and it was probably my first scramble. Scrambling is more than hiking, but less than mountain climbing. From my limited experience, it seems to usually involve getting up large rocks that require using your upper body more than you normally would in order to hoist yourself up. I wish it hadn't been raining because I would have liked to take some pictures. But, I didn't want to risk it getting wet and stop working again. The rain also made the rocks really slippery, so I had to be careful and take care of my steps so I didn't slip.
It wasn't a very long climb, but it was very steep. All and all though I think it was the best I felt yet about a tough climb like that. I think I had to stop once or twice, but I didn't feel as wiped out when I got to the top as before. So, hopefully that means I'm starting to get my trail legs.
At the top there was a fire tower. Again, I wish it wasn't raining because I would have liked to climb it and get a picture. As it was though, I just wanted to keep moving and the rain and clouds obscured everything and wouldn't have made a good picture anyways. Though, had it not been raining and was just cloudy, I would have attempted it. I'm going to try and get a picture off the internet of what it would have looked like on a better day.
The other tough section was about 12 miles into the hike right after Wallace Gap. This one was more typical of the other tough climbs that I've done in that it was just really steep and slow going. But again, I still felt pretty good after I got through it. I was definitely tired and sore by this point though. 
The rest of the days hike was pretty easy going. I still don't move as fast as i would like, but i seem to be able to go further without getting as tired. There was actually a section several miles in where an older hiker that I had met a few times previously caught up to me. His trail name is Seeker and i think he's in his 70s. I get the impression that he is a pretty experienced hiker, but I'll admit that when he caught up to me, it did put a bit of fire into my legs. I started to move a bit faster because I didn't want him to get so far ahead of me. We ended up getting to Winding Gap at the same time. I was always faster on the climbs, but he was definitely faster overall and would catch up to me pretty quick. Though the last couple of miles we hiked the same speed and we both decided to hike to Winding Gap instead of stopping for the evening at a shelter.
The original plan had been to stop at Rock Gap Shelter for the night and get into Franklin the next morning. But it had literally been raining non-stop since the early morning and the thought of sleeping in wet clothes again motivated me to hike the extra five miles that day instead. In hindsight, it was the right decision. Once I got to Winding Gap and stopped moving (we had to wait about 20-30 minutes for a shuttle to pick us up), I started to shiver pretty violently. Since the temperature was going to drop in the evening, had I stayed at the shelter instead of getting to the hotel a day early, I would have had a very miserable (and potentially dangerous) night.
The previous days depression is completely gone now. Since I got to Franklin early, I'm going to take two days off instead of the original one, but I'll be back on the trail Tuesday ready to continue. It looks like the weather is going to be a lot nicer, so that will be a plus as well.
Breakfast: A Gatorade chocolate chip protein bar.
I didn't eat anything else until I got to the hotel. It was a bad idea, but again the rain just made me want to keep moving. I'm going to rearrange my pack a little bit so that some of my food is more easily accessible. Had I been able to get to it without having to stop, I think I would have ate more.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661966,"Today was a great day. The shuttle picked me up from the hotel and I was on the trail at about 7:30am. It was a little chilly, but it didn't take long to warm up. The whole day was beautiful hiking weather. The sun was out the entire time, there were very few clouds, and it never got really hot. Since it was a really nice day, I was also able to get some pretty good pictures. I'll upload those when I have a better connection. 
There were some tough sections. Particularly the stretch between the Wayah Gap Picnic area at mile 115.2 and the Wayah Bald Observation Tower at 119. It was almost all uphill. Most of it was relatively gradual, but there were sections that were more like stairs.
The other tough one was right at the end of the day from Burningtown Gap at mile 124 to Cold Spring Shelter where I'm staying for the night at mile 125.2. It was short, only about 1.2 miles, but it was a constant uphill climb and it ended up being about 700 feet ascent. Still, I had no major issues with either one, even the last one after about 14 miles of hiking, so the promising trend continues.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661968,"Today was another beautiful day, though it did get a little hotter or it seemed to. That might have been because even though I did less miles than yesterday, it was quite a bit harder. Out of the 11+ miles that I did today, I'd say maybe 3 or 4 were on relatively level terrain. The rest was either up or down, with quite a bit down.
I've definitely gotten better on the uphill, but the downhills are still brutal on my knees. At this point, they are probably my weakest area and what's preventing me from going as fast as I would like to go. They don't really hurt, but they just get really stiff and it makes it difficult to walk with a full stride. Though I will say that sometimes when I'm going downhill, my right knee will get a little painful at times. So far, a decent night's sleep and I'm feeling fine for the next day, but hopefully they start getting stronger soon.
There were some spectacular views though. I was able to get some pretty good pictures. There was an old fire tower at Wesser Bald (mile 130.2) that I climbed to the top of and was able to see for miles. It's one of the best views I've encountered so far.
Tonight I'm staying at the Dogwood Lodge. I was originally going to stay in one of the bunkhouses, but it was basically just a small wooden room (not much bigger than a walk in closet) that had a built in bunkbed with a crappy mattress (if that's what you even want to call it, it was basically a thin blue plastic like material) with no linens and a small bench. I decided to pay the extra to get an actual room that had a real bed and more importantly access to a shower and laundry facilities. No need to ""rough it"", if I don't have to.Also, I have decided on my trail name. I think Argonaut is a good choice. It goes with my first name, my time in the Navy, and the myth is somewhat analogous (with a bit of stretched imagination) to the journey I'm on now. I've been using it for a week or so now and it works for me.
Breakfast: Kodiak Blueberries and Cream Oatmeal Cup. It was decent, but it doesn't pack very well, so I probably won't get it again.

Lunch: A peanut butter and banana taco (same thing as yesterday).

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662123,"I started a lot later than normal since I knew it would be a short mile day. I think it was about 9:45am when I finally got on the trail. I just didn't want to leave the nice warm bed until I had to. But even though I only went 7 miles, it was the hardest 7 miles I've done yet and it's a top contender for the hardest day overall. 
Coming out of the NOC, it was an ascent of about 3300 feet in about 6 miles. So it was almost all uphill with a lot of the sections really uphill. There were several spots where I'd go about 100 feet and have to stop and take a break. I guess it's a good introduction to what the Smokies are going to be like, which I'll be starting in just a few more days.
I recovered pretty quickly once I got to the shelter though, so I think I'll be good to go tomorrow. I'm going to try for a big mile day because I'm taking a zero before starting the Smokies and I'd like to get to where I'm staying as early as possible.
Breakfast: There wasn't a place that served breakfast, so that was a little disappointing. I just got a package of Smores pop tarts from the general store.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662126,"Today wasn't a bad day, but it was a day where things didn't align very well.
The first 11 miles were pretty difficult. Nothing like the 3000+ climb from yesterday, but there were more climbs and they were all hundred or more foot climbs and most of them had sections where the incline was probably close to 45 degrees, if not more and they went on for a while. The biggest one was right at the beginning and it was close to 700 feet. Then once you got to the top, it was oftentimes a fairly steep climb down.
After I got to Stecoah Gap, there was a pretty tough climb out buy then it leveled out pretty good. Unfortunately, right when the terrain got easier, it started raining. It would rain for an hour, then quit, rain for 45 minutes,  then quit, and just for good measure when I was about a mile from the shelter I'd be staying at, it started raining again. Heaven forbid I have some dry clothes for the morning.I will also say that I do feel a bit of frustration with how slow I hike sometimes. This was most acute between Cody Gap (mile 156) and the Cable Gap Shelter (159.2). I left Cody Gap knowing that I wanted to get to the shelter as quickly as possible so that I would increase the chance that I could sleep in the shelter and not have to put up my tent in the rain. I also knew that there were others who were going to do the same thing. I don't know how much time was between when I left and when they left, but it didn't take long before I could hear them behind me. So I tried to pick up my pace and there were sections that I literally started running. Yet they were still able to pass me with about a mile still left to go. Fortunately it didn't matter because I was able to get into the shelter. Now, this isn't something I'm losing any sleep over, but it is a minor annoyance that even when I'm trying to be quicker, it's still not enough. Damn young people and their better knees and higher energy reserves.
Overall though it was a good hike. I managed to get 15+ miles which will make tomorrow a lot easier. I'll hopefully be able to get to the lodge I'm staying at early and have plenty of time to relax. I'm taking the next day off as well so that I am as fresh as possible when I start the Smokey mountains. According to what I've read, this will be one of the hardest sections on the entire AT, but the views should be spectacular. 
Breakfast: Good To-Go Oatmeal. This was better than I expected. Usually when I make oatmeal at home, I have to put a bunch of brown sugar or some other kind of sweetener in order to eat it. This had enough stuff in it that I was able to eat it pretty easily. It still wasn't sweet enough for my liking, but it was close enough. 
Snack 1: Second Nature Super Omega Smart Mix. It was fine. I can't say I prefer this over the other variety or not. They are both basically just nuts.
Lunch: 2 Keto tortillas with Starkist BBQ chicken packets. This would have been better warm and with maybe some greens or something else to enhance it, but it was still good enough cold and by itself. I also had a trail magic banana. I had stopped in a parking lot area on the side of a fairly busy road. Some lady pulled up, dropped off a bag of bananas and then left.
Snack 2: Frosted honey bun. 720 calories in compact form.
Recovery Drink: Around 5 scoops plus a full packet. I ran out of the powder I'd been carrying from the beginning and the NOC only had individual packets so I ended up making more than usual.

The sun was shining the entire time, but whether because of the altitude or just the temperature it never got hot. I'd say the high was around 55 degrees. It was also pretty breezy so that helped keep me cool as well.It was also not near as bad as I expected it to be. According to FarOut, the total ascent from the Marina parking lot to Mollies Ridge Shelter was 4547 feet, which is about 1200 feet more than the ascent coming out of the NOC. Yet this was 13.4 miles compared to 7 something at the NOC. I'll also add that it didn't really start going uphill until I was about 10 miles from the shelter. But that extra 3+ miles really made a difference. It was mostly uphill, but it was much more gradual and so much more manageable. There were only a few sections that started to get steep, but not compared to NOC or even Albert mountain coming into NC for the first time.The shelter here is also pretty decent. It's fairly large, sleeping a total of 14 I think, but most people are in tents so i think there are only about 5 of us. Apparently before Covid, all thru-hikers were required to sleep in the shelters, but because of social distancing they have relaxed that rule. Its also a rule that if the shelter is full and a section hiker shows up, they get priority no matter what time. I'm not a fan of this rule, but hopefully it wont be an issue. Parts of it are a little drafty, which may get uncomfortable tonight once the sun goes down (I think it's supposed to be in the mid 30s to low 40s with fairly heavy wind). But fortunately I think I'm in a part that isn't drafty at all. The other rule that only applies in the Smokies (as far as I'm aware) is that you have to hang anything that has food or any other kind of odor on bear cables that are provided at each shelter. This includes bear canisters. Unfortunately bear canisters don't have anchor points or hooks or anything else that I could attach a cable to. So, I've been forced to put it in my backpack and hang that.Breakfast: Ham, onion, and cheese quiche with tater tots and an orange juice at Wing and Hoof.

When I first entered the Smokies, I thought the hike to the shelter was relatively easy. I thought that if that was it, then I didn't get how people said the Smokies were one of the harder sections on the AT. Well, the past two days have shown why. They've definitely been the hardest back to back days that I've had so far. I also decided that this was the time I was going to up my miles per day as well. Between these two things, I've been pretty exhausted by the time I've gotten to the shelter. Yesterday I was fast asleep before 8. Today I probably won't be up much past that.
All of the shelters in the Smokies have been made of stone and they have all had stone fireplaces built into them. At each one that I've stayed at, there has also been another hiker who has taken advantage of that and built a fire using dead wood from off the ground. It was really nice the first night because it did get rather cold and the fire helped keep the shelter area a little warmer. It wasn't need as much last night because it didn't get as cold, but it was still welcome. Except when he got up at like 4 in the morning to light it back up and it lit the shelter up as if someone had turned on a lamp.
Breakfast: 4 Kind peanut butter breakfast bars
Snack 1: The last few slices of dried mangoes that I had.
Lunch: Pea tortilla peanut butter taco and some dried apricots. I really need to get something else when I resupply. Peanut butter is getting old, fast. Also, I thought the apricots were going to be like what I get in some trail mix, but these were a lot softer and chewier. I didn't hate them, but I would have preferred the ones like I got in the trail mix.
Snack 2: A few dried apricots. 
Recovery Drink: One package of Carnation Instant Breakfast. 
Dinner: A bag of Knorr chicken flavored rice with two packets of Starkist BBQ chicken. This was better than the Teriyaki mix from yesterday, but some of the rice was a little crunchy. This has been a problem with all the Knorr rich packets because I'm just adding boiling water to the packet and letting it sit for 15 minutes or so. You're supposed to let it simmer in boiling water for about 7 minutes, but I don't want to waste the fuel or dirty a dish if I don't absolutely have to.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662415,"Today was a pretty easy day. I got started on the trail at 5:30am. I had heard there was a free shuttle into Gatlinburg that left Newfound Gap at 10:00am and it was a little over 5 miles from the shelter, so I wanted to make sure I got there in time. It turns out I didn't need to leave quite so early because the hike was very easy. I ended up getting to Newfound at a little past 8:00am. It was nice to have the extra time though. I got to throw away some trash, use the restroom and just relax for a little while.
The Sevierville First Baptist church is the group that does the free shuttle. They also setup a trail magic table that had all kinds of snacks. There were oranges, bananas, honeybuns, trail mix, Nutter Butter, just to name a few things. They also had a cooler full of water, pop, and various other drinks. They put out chairs to sit on, they had plastic bags you could take, it really was a full service trail magic stop. It was definitely the largest and most organized one I've come across.
I left Newfound Gap on the shuttle at 10:00am and it took about 20 minutes to get to Gatlinburg. I thought I had been there before, but none of what I saw looked familiar. They did have an NOC building (which is affiliated with the NOC from a few days ago), but overall it wasn't a great resupply town. It was very touristy, so there were no grocery stores in the area that we got dropped off at. There was a Walgreens, but it was pretty small and didn't have much that a hiker could use. Though I did get some Starburst jellybeans, so it wasn't a complete bust.
For lunch I had Cicis pizza with some other hikers that I've come across a lot. 10 bucks for all you can eat pizza and pasta is a pretty good deal for a calorie deprived thru-hiker.
I got back to Newfound at about 2:00 and was on the trail shortly after. It was only about 3 miles to the shelter where I was staying, but it was almost all uphill. It was gradual though so  overall my hiking day was pretty short and easy. I also hiked the entire way with another hiker named Woobie. He's a retired army guy, so it was nice to have someone to talk to while I was hiking. It did take my mind off the effort and made the climb seem a lot faster.
Breakfast: 4 Kind peanut butter breakfast bars.
Trail Magic: A lot. I had an orange, a package of Nutter Butters, a cinnamon roll, and a Yoo-hoo
Lunch: Cicis pizza
Recovery Drink: One package of Carnation Instant Breakfast 
Dinner: Backpackers Pantry Shepherd's Potato Stew with Beef. This is a top pick for me. The only negative is that even at 2 servings, it's only 430 calories. When I get it next time, I'll see if I can pair it with some shredded cheddar cheese to give it some more calories.","Mount Collins Shelter
",Icewater Spring Shelter ,"Apr 20, Thu",8.30
Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662480,"I made a last minute adjustment to my original plan. I was going to go from Icewater Spring Shelter to Tri-Corner Knob Shelter to Davenport Gap Shelter, get a shuttle and resupply, then get back on the trail the same day. However, when I got to Tri-Corner  it was only about 2:30pm and I had already kind of decided earlier at Icewater that I really wanted to get off the trail and get to a place where I could take a shower and do some laundry. If you look at some of the picture I took of myself, you may notice white lines on my black shirt. That is salt left over from evaporated sweat. 
I had also been wearing the same pair of socks for several days (I regret sending the other pair I had home) and I was just at a level of grossness that I could no longer tolerate. 
The only issue was that because you are required to stay at the shelters while in the Smokies, I'd have to walk an additional 7+ miles on top of the 13+ I'd already walked to get to Tri-Corner. So, I told myself that when I got to Tri-Corner, I'd take a break, get something to eat, and see how I felt after 45 minutes or so. Well, after all that I felt like I still had some left in the tank, so I made the decision that I would hike the 7+ miles to the next shelter. 
Now that I'm here, I think I made the right decision. I won't know for sure until probably tomorrow and I see how my joints feel. But I've already called and made reservations at The Discerning Hiker hostel for tomorrow night, so I have a hot shower, laundry, and a warm bed to look forward to. 
The only thing that kind of killed the good vibe that I was feeling about the 20+ mile hike was when I got to the shelter it was packed. It was the most packed I'd ever seen a shelter area yet, even more than in the very beginning when everyone is all bunched up together in the bubble. There had to have been at least 45 people total. There were so many that a large number of them had to go to another area about .2 miles to the south. 
I don't know why there were so many, but I think because it was Friday, a lot of them were section hikers and it is a shelter that is close to the northern border of the Smokies. So I will have to sleep in my tent. It wouldn't be as big of a pain except it's supposed to rain tonight and the location the I'm at is at the bottom of a hill on one side of my tent and a giant fallen tree on the other. So, if it does rain significantly, my tent site will probably act like a bathtub. But there are so many people that there really aren't any better sites that I could find.
I also met another hiker who had a full blown, 3 foot tail. I actually first saw him when we were on the shuttle leaving Gatlinburg. I then talked to him briefly at Newfound Gap, and then a little bit more at Icewater Spring. His trail name is Strange Bird and it's certainly apt. From the little I talked to him he seemed like an interesting guy. He's the kind of person that has opinions that he's not hesitant about sharing, but not in an arrogant I know I'm right kind of way. 
Anyway, from what I could gather,  the origins of the tail had something to do with a ripped pair of pants. I don't remember the context, but he told someone that he'd always wanted a tail and so instead of fixing the hole in his pants, they gave him something that was supposed to be like a tail. Well, he didn't like it because apparently it didn't behave in a way that he thought a tail should. So he fashioned himself a new one using some metal and other materials. Now when he moves, the tail moves in a way that he thinks it should. Unfortunately I didn't even think about getting a picture. 
Breakfast: 4 Kind peanut butter breakfast bars 
Snack 1: Several dried apricots 
Lunch: Peanut butter taco
Dinner 1 (or if you're in Europe, Supper): Mountain House Pro-Pak Chili Mac: Pretty good. I'll get it again.
Snack 2: A couple more dried apricots
Dinner 2: Good To-Go Thai Curry. This was pretty good but I didn't read the instructions before I opened it. It was supposed to soak for 20 minutes, but by the time I got to the shelter, found a tent site, and got all settled in, it was already starting to get dark. I think in a rush I didn't let it soak long enough and some of the rice was still pretty hard. I also didn't end up eating it all because I was tired and just wanted to go to bed.","Icewater Spring Shelter

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662602,"I woke up at 2:15am, tried for about 15 minutes to fall back asleep, then made the decision that I would just start hiking so that I could get to the hostel earlier and have longer to relax. 
Fortunately it hadn't rained during the night, so everything was still dry. I get everything packed up and just as I was getting the last thing into my pack at about 3:00am, the rain finally starts and it didn't take long for it to start pouring. I was actually pretty thankful that I was at least able to get everything put away before it started. Unfortunately just as I was starting up the trail, I realized that I was missing a water bottle. So, I put my backpack and trekking poles in the privy house and walked back to my tent site to look for it. It wasn't there and it wasn't at the shelter. I didn't look any further and have no idea where I left it.
The hike itself wasn't terrible. It was just wet, dark, sometimes windy, and somewhat cold. It started with a decent climb, and ended with a very long descent out of the Smokies. Over the course of about 6.6 miles I dropped over 3,700 feet. It was a little tough on the knees, but it did get a little warmer the lower I got. 
It was about 9:00am by the time I finally got to the location where the hostel owner was waiting to pick me up. It was a bit of a bummer because there was a small group there who were in the process of setting up what looked like a pretty nice trail magic site. They had several tables with warmers and hot plates, so they were definitely going to be serving hot food. But since the guy was waiting and I was tired and wet, I just got in his truck, got to the hostel and after a brief tour, soaked in a bathtub of hot water for about 45 minutes. 
I'm really glad I made the choice to get off the trail for a day instead of just resupplying and moving on. Getting to take a hot bath, then a hot shower, do laundry, and get some decent food in me just hit the spot so nicely. The owner also took us into town so we could resupply at Walmart and get some dinner.
While I was at the hostel, I met a woman who had been there since the day before. She had to leave the trail because she accidentally poisoned herself. Apparently it is somewhat popular for people to pick wild ramps and either eat them straight or add them to their meals. They are a type of onion. But there is another plant that looks similar called the Lily of the Valley and it is extremely toxic. Well, this woman ate one of those thinking it was a ramp and a short time later started getting sick. She called 911 but because of the poor reception the call dropped and when she called again, she got a different 911 call center because the section that she was at was right at the border between North Carolina and Tennessee. Meanwhile, she had to hike like 4 miles in order to get somewhere that had a road. She was finally able to get to the hospital and get treated and fortunately there were no long term affects. She just had to take a few days off to rest. She was going to slack pack a section today and get back to full hiking tomorrow. She was able to laugh about it after the fact, but it's definitely a lesson about making sure you know what you're doing if you're going to eat wild food.
Breakfast: It was too early so I just skipped it.
Once I got to the hostel, there was fruit available so I ate two or three oranges, a banana, and I had a cup of hot chocolate. 
Lunch: Surfer Boy Multi-meat frozen pizza. The claim to fame for this is that it's the pizza company on the show Stranger Things. It was fine. It was a frozen pizza.
Dinner: I bought some Jack Daniel's pulled pork, maple roasted sweet potatoes, and some vegetables in cheese sauce at Walmart and cooked it up at the hostel. It was pretty good, but I undercooked the potatoes a little bit.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662734,"I got playfully made fun of a little bit this morning. There were two other people sleeping in the same area that I was in and apparently about 30 seconds after we turned the lights out at around 9:00am I was fast asleep. They knew that I was asleep because I started snoring. The woman who was staying there (her trail name is Slaw) just thought it was funny that I was so tired that I fell asleep so quickly. I had been up since about 3:00am. so I was pretty exhausted. There were even times earlier in the day when I'd dozed off for a few minutes before I realized it.
I knew it was going to be a short hiking day (about 7 miles), so I decided to leave the hostel a little late. It was about 10am when I got back on the trail. It was a moderately difficult hike. I started at an elevation of about 1,371 feet and got to 4,263 feet at the top of Snowbird mountain in about 6 miles. There weren't any real steep climbs, but it was a steady uphill almost the entire way. The weather was also pretty mild and towards the top even got a little chilly because of the wind.
There was a pretty neat landmark at the top. About 50 yards or so from the trail was a large antenna. It was an FAA radar antenna used for air traffic control. Unfortunately I couldn't get too close because there was a fence around it and all kinds of warning signs posted.
From there it was about 2.5 miles and 1,400 feet downhill to the shelter where I was going to stay. It was about 3:00pm when I arrived at the shelter and I did think about trying to do a few more miles, but just decided to take it easy. Instead I made the decision to get to Hot Springs in two days instead of the planned three I was originally going to do. So, tomorrow will be another big mile day.
Breakfast: Fried cranberry bread with bananas, strawberries, and whipped cream that was made by the owner of the hostel. He also made baked apples and I had a cup of hot chocolate. 
I'm writing this a few days after the fact and can't remember if I stopped for lunch.
Recovery Drink: I was a little cold when I got to the shelter, so I tried adding boiling water to the Carnation Instant Breakfast mix. It was good, but next time I won't use boiling water because it was too hot to drink right away and took too long to cool off enough.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662740,"Today was a long day and it ended up being quite a bit tougher than I had anticipated when I looked at the A.T. guide the day before.  But, there were some great views and an awesome trail magic spot.
One of the tougher sections was the climb from the shelter to Max Patch. It wasn't as big of an elevation change as yesterday, 2,897 feet to 4,629, but it just seemed like there were more sections that were quite a bit steeper. But the view at the top was amazing. The whole area was cleared for cattle grazing (not sure if it's still used for that purpose, but I don't think it is) so there are no trees to block any of the views. I don't know the exact size of the area, but it's enough to give a 360 degree view of all the surrounding mountains.
The other notably difficult climb was coming out of Lemon Gap. It wasn't very high, about 700 feet, but for whatever reason, parts of the trail just got really steep. Fortunately at Lemon Gap I came across one of the best trail magic spots yet.
There was a former PCT (Pacific Coast Trail) hiker named Midnight Rider there and he had a stand setup. He was only giving out one thing, but that one thing was freshly made apple fritters covered in a maple glaze. And when I say freshly made, I mean he didn't start making them until you got there. They were hot, messy, and absolutely delicious.
He said he moved to the area partly because he wanted to open up a burger/ice cream restaurant. He had done a trial run sometime before and there seemed to be a lot of interest, so he was out doing the apple fritter thing while waiting for some logistics to get completed for his restaurant. If his burgers and ice cream are as good as the fritters, then I think he's got a good shot a success.
Now I'm at an unnamed campsite that's a little under 8 miles from Hot Springs. Yesterday I called and reserved a room that has a jacuzzi tub in it, so I'm definitely looking forward to that.
There are three other ladies here at the campsite with me. They are first time backpackers and are headed into Hot Springs tomorrow as well. I think they said they started at Max Patch and are doing this as a sort of trial run to see if they like it.
This will be the first time that I'll be sleeping at a tent site and not at or near a shelter. If I thought I could make it to the next shelter, I would, but that would put me at 23 miles for the day and that's just too much for me. The tent site is decent, but pretty small. It just fits the four of us and definitely requires some careful steps so as not to trip over stakes and tent cords. My tent is also at a bit of an angle, so I'll be sleeping a little sideways this evening. Other than that, it's pretty nice. It's on a rock outcrop, so there is a cliff nearby that has a fairly decent creek flowing down below. There's also a pretty good water source close by. All in all, it could be worse.
Breakfast: Good To-Go Breakfast Hash. This one had butternut squash, spinach, feta cheese, and rosemary. It also continued the trend of me not being able to find a good hot breakfast option. It wasn't terrible, it was just rather bland.
Snack 1: I finished up the bag of dried apricots I had.
Lunch: 2 peanut butter tacos and some Nice! tropical trail mix. This has been my favorite trail mix blend so far. The dried fruit gave it the sweetness that I usually like better.
Trail Magic: Fresh apple fritter made by Midnight Rider.
Dinner: Knorr Chicken Brocolli rice with added chicken. This probably would have been better, but I didn't mix it well enough so all the seasoning was still at the bottom of the packet when I ate it.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662756,"Not much about the hike into town to talk about. I was on the trail at about 6am and got into Hot Springs at about 9:30am. I could start seeing the town from up in the mountains probably about 45 minutes to an hour before I actually got there. It started out as a bit of a morale boost, but I was starting to get impatient towards the end.
I got checked into the Iron Station Inn, went and got some breakfast, and spent the day resupplying, eating, resting, and relaxing. It's a very small town, you can walk from one end to the other in about 20 minutes, so there isn't much recreation to do. Which I'm fine with. I think I've pushed myself a little too hard the past week because my Achilles tendon area is starting to get pretty sore. I've already taken full advantage of the jacuzzi tub in my room, so hopefully that and the time spent without 30+ pounds on my back will give it enough time to settle back down. I'm also going to take it a bit slower when I start back up again on Thursday.
The one downside that has been hanging over my day so far though is what's up ahead. In planning my next week or so, I checked the weather and it looks like it's going to be pretty crappy for the next 3 or 4 days. There are supposed to be rain showers and thunderstorms pretty much everyday until at least Monday. I know it's part of the deal with this whole trip, but it still brings me down quite a bit. It's not really the rain so much as the rain combined with the low temperatures. I'm just a little tired of having to wake up cold every morning. It's almost May, in the South. Where are my warm temperatures? 
Breakfast: 4 Kind Dark Chocolate Cocoa breakfast bars. These are a little better than the peanut butter ones. But that might just be because I'm sick of peanut butter. 
Lunch: Country Fried Steak meal at the Smokey Mountain Diner. It was an 11oz country fried steak covered in gravy, two scrambled eggs, hash browns, and a biscuit with more gravy. I ate it all and it was fantastic.
Dinner: Iron Horse burger with fries at the Iron Station restaurant which is right downstairs from my room. It was basically a 1/2 bacon BBQ cheeseburger. Maybe it's because it's been a while, but I thought it was a really great hamburger.

I did meet up with TrailTripper, HipHiker, and Walkie Talkie for lunch. They were the three ladies that i had met at the tent site two days ago. I actually saw them yesterday when i was coming down for dinner, but they were leaving as i was coming down. It was nice to see them still in town and have lunch with them.
I will say that being in town or staying at a hostel has been a bit of a double edged sword. It's nice to get into a bed and rest and relax for a night or two, but I do find that it takes a little extra effort to find the motivation to continue. These days off remind me what it's like to feel comfortable on a regular basis and it's hard to give that up.
Breakfast: French toast meal at the Smokey Mountain Diner. It was three pieces of French toast, two scrambled eggs, and a sausage patty. It was good, but pretty basic french toast. I think they just used white bread. I prefer something like Texas toast or brioche bread. I'm spoiled I guess.
Lunch: Grilled cheese with tomato soup at Vaste Riviere Provisions. I'm not sure what kind of cheese they used. Some kind of white cheese, but it was pretty good. It's been forever since I've had tomato soup, so I can't really compare it, but I thought it was good enough that I ate it all.
Snack: Bavarian Cream fried pie from the Hillbilly Market and a chocolate milk. The Hillbilly Market is supposedly known for their fried pies, but I thought mine was just okay.
Dinner: A chicken burrito from Grey Eagle Taqueria. It was about the size of a Chipotle burrito and it had chicken, cheddar cheese, rice, black beans, and curtido (which is lightly fermented cabbage and other vegetables). It was a solid burrito and I'd get it again.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662867,"Today's hike started out okay, but ended less than pleasantly. When I left Hot Springs at about 8:45am, there was a very light sprinkle of rain. It only lasted about 30-45 minutes. It was a pretty decent climb almost the entire hike, but I've come to expect that whenever I leave a town, hostel, or hostel drop off. All these places, for geographical reason, are located in the gaps of the Appalachian Mountains. So it's always like several thousand feet to get down to them, then several thousand feet to get back up into the mountains when you leave.
As I mentioned, it stopped raining about 45 minutes after I started and remained that way for about 5 miles. It stayed cloudy, a little misty, and occasionally pretty windy. There were times where the wind gusts got so high that even though I was moving, I still got a little chilly at times.
Unfortunately starting at around noon, the rain started back up again. It never got to a torrential pour like I've been in before, but it was a steady light to medium rainfall all the way until I got tobthe shelter. Even now it is still coming down fairly consistently, though I'm hoping it let's up long enough that I can go get some water without getting soaked.
One good thing is that I got to the shelter at just the right time. It's very small, I think the guide says it's built for five, but we were able to fit six, and there were already three people in it when I got here. It was maybe 30 minutes later when enough people had shown up that there was no more room. So, no pitching a tent in the rain for me today.
The weather is supposed to be equally bad, if not worse, tomorrow. I haven't decided yet whether I'll just hike the 8 miles to the next shelter, or the 15 to the one after that. It'll depend on what the weather is like in the morning and how I'm feeling when I get to that first shelter.

When I got to the first shelter, which was only about 8.6 miles from where i started for the day, it was only about noon.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662907,"Cutting my hike short yesterday turned out to be the correct decision. It rained during the night, so it was pretty misty this morning, but by about noon or so it had cleared up and was sunny my entire hike.I will note that at about 4:00am, some asshat came into camp, setup at the picnic table right in front of the shelter, and turned on a light that was basically a miniature sun. It lit up the entire shelter and then he decided it would be a good idea to fire up his stove. So, it was super bright and pretty loud. I finally got up to go to the bathroom and on my way back, rather curtly, asked him how long he planned on being there. I think he got my point because he asked if I wanted him to turn off the light, which I responded that it would be nice since there was a shelter full of people trying to sleep. He did turn off the light, but still made a bit of a racket for another 30-45 minutes before he finally packed up and moved on.My best guess is that he wasn't a thru-hiker, but a homeless guy, possibly a meth head. I've heard they do show up on the trail sometimes, and though I didn't get a good look at him, I did notice that he was missing a bunch of teeth. I ended up getting up not too long afterwards. The plan was originally to try and hike to the closest shelter to Sam's Gap, which was about 2.5 miles away so that i could get to the hostel as early as possible. For some reason I thought it was only about 20 miles. Long, but doable. About 14 miles in though, I discovered that it was actually closer to 23. I was still going to attempt it and I definitely tried my best, but the weather was starting to look just a little too dicey to risk continuing. Overall the hike was pretty easy. There was a section right at the beginning (the Little Laurel Shelter was actually part way up the mountain, so I had actually already climbed a good section of it the day before) that was tough and then another section up to Big Butt about 9 miles into the hike that was also tough. The rest of it was either very flat or only small ups and downs. Had I continued, the climb up to Lick Rock would have also been tough, but... the weather. I wasn't so much worried about the rain as I was about thunderstorms. The clouds were getting awfully dark and the last section before getting to the shelter involved going up and over Lick Rock, which was about 1,500 feet or so. I just didn't want to risk being that high in a thunderstorm, so I took advantage of an opportunity that presented itself.When I got to Rector Laurel Road, which is right before the beginning of the ascent, there was a sign pointing toward the direction of a hostel called Laurel Hostel. There was a couple who I had met a few shelters back who had originally told me about it and they were considering staying there also. I had actually passed it and was going to continue on the trail, but that's when I looked at the sky and saw how dark it was getting, so I turned around and am now staying at the hostel. I still did almost 17 miles today and the hostel is only $25 for a bed. Though it didn't actually end up raining, I think it is supposed to rain tonight and into tomorrow morning. Even if I had made it to the shelter, it would have almost certainly been full. That means a tent, which means I probably would have had to pack up everything tomorrow in the rain. So, I'll stay here tonight and hopefully the weather clears up by early tomorrow morning and I can still get to Sam's Gap at a good time.

In hindsight I don't know if it was the best decision or not, but I did make it to the hostel at about 8:30am, so I have spent most of the day being able to relax.It didn't rain a lot during the hike, light showers on and off a few times, but it was humid and damp the entire time so I still got pretty soaked. Night hiking is also an interesting experience. It's generally quiet and because your sight is limited, you're forced into a kind of tunnel vision as you're walking. It's also kind of nice to get where you're going, the sun is brand new, and you've already put on several miles for the day. However, I don't think I'll do it again soon unless I really have to. Because of the limited visibility, I have to concentrate harder on where I'm stepping, especially when going downhill. It also means that I woke up earlier, so I'm also not as rested as I could be. Maybe when it starts to get hotter I might reconsider, just to avoid hiking in the blistering sun.Breakfast: 4 Kind Dark Chocolate Cocoa breakfast barsLunch: Great Value meat lasagna at the hostelSnack: An orange Dinner: A baked potato with pulled pork and house made BBQ sauce.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663095,"I made a very unfortunate mistake today. I woke up feeling pretty good. Had a very processed, but high calorie breakfast. Filled my water bottles, got on the shuttle and was at the trail head by about 8:30am. As soon as I got off the shuttle, turned on my GPS tracking, and put my pack on, I looked down and my heart just dropped. When I refilled my water bottles, instead of immediately putting them back on my pack, I set them down on a table inside the hostel common area. They were still at the hostel common area while I was at the beginning of the trail.It wouldn't have been too big of a deal, the hostel was only a out a 5-10 minute drive away, except that when the hostel owner got back, she was supposed to shuttle another group to a different location that was in the opposite direction and it was going to be at least an hour.I didn't have a choice, I couldn't hike with no water, so I ended up having to go back to the hostel and wait for her to drop off the other group. When all was said and done, I got back to the trail at about 10:30am, so I lost about 2 hours. Fortunately I was only going about 13 miles, so I was still able to get to camp at around 4:30pm. The only thing I really lost was the few hours of rest I could have had if I had started at 8:30. So, it wasn't the worst thing ever. Just kind of annoying. I'd say it ranks right below that second day that I went the wrong direction for a mile and a half.Overall the hike itself was pretty pleasant. Coming out of Sam's Gap was a little tough and the climb up to Big Bald was really tough, but that was only about 3-4 miles of the 13 I did today. The rest was either fairly level of slightly up or down. The weather was decent. It was mostly cloudy with the sun occasionally popping out for 10-15 minutes before getting cloudy again. The wind was pretty gusty, so it did get chilly at times, but when it wasn't blowing it was cool and dry enough that I didn't even really sweat all that much.The one exception was near the top and at the top of Big Bald. There was no tree cover at all and the wind was constantly blowing at around 40 mph. This made it pretty cold. My core was fine, but my hands did start to hurt from being so cold. But the view was spectacular. It reminded me of Max Patch. There was a 360 degree view of everything.I also want to mention an incident that I heard about a few days ago, but forgot to mention. There were some hikers that I've leap frogged a few times staying at a camp site before the Little Laurel Shelter (I think). Apparently some bears came into their camp multiple times throughout the night attempting to steal their food that was hanging in the trees. They'd scare them away and 30 minutes later they'd come back. They finally seemed to scare them off for good until sometime during the early morning they heard a loud crack and then a crash. One of the bears had climbed the tree and gotten out onto the branch where the bags were and it broke under his weight. The crash they heard was the bear hitting the ground. They managed to get away with at least one person's food bag, but I think the others had a secondary line attached to them so they didn't get taken.It's supposed to get pretty cold again tonight, the mid 30s I think. There is a slight chance of rain, and in fact it has sprinkled a few times briefly since I got in my tent, but I don't thin it's supposed to be a lot. One downside (among many) of colder weather, especially at a tent site with no shelter house, is that there isn't as much socializing. Everyone sat around during dinner and talked for a bit, but after that it starts to get dark, the temperature starts dropping, and everyone just wants to get into their tent to get warm. It's only about 8:15pm and I might just go to bed because there really isn't anything else to do. I do have my Kindle, so I might read for a bit first.Breakfast: A package of chocolate chip muffins, two frosted strawberry pop tarts, and a small bottle of orange juice. Like I said, highly processed.Snack 1: A package of peanut butter crackers.Trail Magic: Someone left several coolers full of various things on the trail. One cooler was empty, one had some canned meat, and the other had some fruit and other things. I took an apple.Lunch: Since I started late, I decided to skip lunch and just keep moving.Snack 2: SnickersRecovery Drink: 8 scoops of Carnation Instant Breakfast Dinner: Peak Beef with noodles and marinara sauce. I think I've had this before or something similar. It was fine, but I put too much water in it.","Sam's Gap

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663096,"Last night or maybe early morning it did rain at the campsite a few times where I stayed. Fortunately it was very light and didn't last long. It wasn't even enough to leave the ground wet in the morning when I woke up. It's still a bit chilly in the mornings, but not terrible. Once I'm up and moving, I warm up pretty quick.
Terrain wise the hike was pretty easy. As usual there were some pretty sharp inclines, but for the most part it was pretty flat. Though a lot of the flat parts were either fairly rocky or fairly rooty, so it did do a number on my feet. Also, there was like a 2 mile stretch where I really had to go to the bathroom, but it was literally a 60 degree incline on one side of me and a 60 degree decline on the other side of me. That was an uncomfortable few miles.
Though the trail doesn't go directly through Erwin, TN like it did Hot Springs, it is close enough that like Hot Springs, you can see it from the trail quite a while before you actually get to it (or in this case as close as you can get, which is about 3 miles). I think from the first time I saw it, it was about an hour before I actually got there.
Despite the easiness of the terrain itself, for whatever reason I still hard a hard time of it today. Maybe it was pushing myself a little too hard yesterday since I got such a late start. I'm staying at Uncle Johnny's hostel, which is right off the trail and neat Erwin. Hopefully a good nights rest is all I need, but I may take an unplanned zero tomorrow depending on how I feel when I wake up. I'd rather not if I don't have to, but I've got to take care of myself if I want to make it all the way to Maine.
Breakfast: 4 Nature's Bakery Blueberry Fig Bars
Snack: Package of peanut butter crackers.
Lunch: I got to the hostel right around noon, so I didn't really get a lunch. They have a store here, but I guess there was only one person working at the time and he was gone to shuttle some people into town. They didn't have a very good selection anyway. 
Recovery Drink: 2 Yoo-hoos. I would have preferred chocolate milk, but that's all they had.
Early dinner: 3 piece chicken meal with fries and mac and cheese at bojangles.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663147,"I was feeling good this morning, so I decided to go ahead and get back on the trail. Now that I'm at my camping spot tonight, I'd say it was the right choice. In fact, though the trail wasn't too bad, I'd say that mentally this was one of my best days yet. I was still about as sore as usual when I got to camp, but I still felt really good.I think yesterday I just pushed myself a little too hard and didn't eat enough throughout the day. I think another thing that may have helped today was that I didn't have any kind of urgency to get to my destination. I knew I wasn't staying at a shelter, so I didn't have to hurry to try and get a spot. The weather forecast was great, so I didn't have to hurry and try to beat the rain. And since I knew I was going to a campsite, I didn't really have to worry about finding a spot. If it was full, I had enough time to just fund another. It allowed me to just hike at a decent, but not hurried pace. I also took a couple of snack breaks and a good lunch break. I made sure to get plenty of food when I resupplied at Food City yesterday. My next resupply is scheduled for 4 days, but i probably have enough food for 6. Like I said, I was still sore as ever when i got to the campsite, but I wasn't also mentally exhausted as well.I actually did end up hiking an extra mile and a half. I was going to stay at a campsite in Beauty Spot Gap, but when I looked on Farout, there were comments under the Unaka Mountain waypoint that said it was like tenting in a park or an enchanted forest. I couldn't pass that chance up and I have to say I can understand where they are coming from. The entire summit of Unaka is just a bunch of Spruce trees. The ground is covered in Spruce pine needles so it's very soft. I've got a couple of pictures (or I will when my reception is good enough to upload them) that give an idea of what it looks like.So far I'm the only person at thus tent site, so this may end up being the first time I've spent the night somewhere by myself.

Well, the enchanted forest did not turn into a horror forest. The only evil spirits that showed up were the spirit of being way to windy at night and the spirit of being too friggin cold in the morning. The biggest problem with the wind last night wasn't that it blew real hard in my tent area. There were enough trees that it wasn't too bad. Instead, it was just really loud above the tree line, so I didn't really get a good nights sleep. I also think that the sleeping pad just isn't working. I just don't have enough cushion between myself and the ground. When I get to Damascus, I may see if I can find another air mattress. Hopefully I can find a decent one that doesn't sound like I'm on a bag of potato chips every time I move.
I may have said this before, but I DO NOT LIKE WAKING UP COLD. And it was very cold this morning. I believe it got down to the mid 30s overnight and it wasn't much warmer in the morning. It just takes that much more effort to get moving when it's that cold and even after I start, my body gets pretty stiff when its that cold. Having gloves would have helped, but I never thought I'd need them in May, in the South. But, I did get moving and once the sun came up and was out for a while, I started warming up pretty quick. It actually turned out to be a pretty nice day and I do believe the weather is calling for increased temperatures over the next few days. It might rain in the next few days, but I think if it does it's only supposed to be for a few hours. Hopefully that holds. Actually, hopefully it doesn't rain at all, but beggars and choosers and all that.
I will say that I could get used to this camping for a day or two and then staying in a hostel. I don't know if my bank account would support that all the way to Maine, but it would be nice.
The hostel I'm staying at tonight is called the Greasy Creek Friendly. It was actually a little difficult to find. Once you get to Greasy Creek Gap, you have to take this side trail that winds through the forest for about half a mile. It's not marked and more than once I wasn't sure I was actually going in the right direction. But, I finally made it and Cee Cee and Gadget are wonderful hosts. Cee Cee made all the guests a hamburger dinner at no extra charge and I know she's given some other things, including beer and wine, at no charge as well.
The hostel has a pretty interesting history from what I've gathered. When Cee Cee first opened up the place back in the early 2000s, it was just her. Apparently she has a neighbor that wasn't too thrilled about it and did things like put signs at the trail saying the place was closed when it wasn't all the way to actually destroying property like digging up water lines and such.
She also has an ex-husband who I think owned the land and was threatening to sell it.
Fortunately things seem to have worked out. Another hiker named Gadget came through here some years ago and became a business partner. He really helped Cee Cee out. Among other things he took the nasty neighbor to court and won, so the harassment has completely stopped. He also created a GoFundMe campaign to help with the land issues. I don't know if everything has been completely worked out, but things do seem to at least trending in the right direction. I for one am glad they are here. Hostels like this make hiking the trail so much better.
Breakfast: A bagel with one half with peanut butter andnthe other half with Nutella. I may get sick of peanut butter, but I don't think I'll ever get sick of Nutella. It doesn't hold up as well in the cold though. It was very hard and instead of spreading on the bagel, it was more like chunked on.
Snack 1: Some dried fruit mix.
Lunch: Summer sausage and cheddar cheese.  I know they say you can carry this without having to worry about it going bad for a while, but I still think I'm going to trash it. I took a few bites of it and it just wasn't doing it for me.
Recovery Drink: Cee Cee made me a nice glass of milk with chocolate syrup.
Supper: A Marie Calendar chicken pot pie and a Sprite.
Dinner: A hamburger with fries and some vegetables that Cee Cee made. Also a Dr. Pepper.","Unaka Mountain

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663366,"Today was a tough day. I got started later than normal, around 8:30am, and had to do a 0.6 mile hike from the hostel back to the trailhead.  I think I mentioned this yesterday, but it's not marked at all and there were several forks on my way out that I had to make an educated guess on which one to take. Fortunately with the help of the FarOut app, I was able to navigate my way back to where I needed to be.
Once I got back on the trail, the first 5 or so miles weren't terrible, but there were enough climbs that it did tire me out. This is significant because the last 4 or 5 miles was the climb up Roan Mountain. It was basically three solid hours of almost all uphill. The total elevation change was about 2,500 feet. There was a small section that was flat, but that was right before the final climb of about 950 feet. It was at this flat section that I did take a little nap. Several miles earlier I had crossed paths with a hiker named Steve that I've run into before. When we got to that flat area, we decided to take a rest break. He went off to get some water, so I just leaned back on my pack that was on the ground and took about a 10-15 minute nap. It did help a little with that last 950 foot climb.
Right before the start of the Roan climb is Hughes Gap. About half a mile before, a rather elaborate sign that said trail magic ahead was posted. With a sign like that, the expectations were pretty high. And it did not disappoint. Chipmunk, CK, and Patience, thru-hikers from last year had several tents setup with chairs all over. They were making tacos for Cinco de Mayo. One guy was toasting the tortillas and grilling the meat, there was a table that had all kinds of taco toppings. They had junk food, beer, pop, water and a bunch of other stuff as well. It was one of the best trail magic setups that I've been to. I'm not sure though whether it helped or hurt my Roan climb. On the one hand, I ended up relaxing and eating for about 45 minutes. On the other hand, I probably ate 5 lbs of food which I then had to carry up the mountain with me.
When I finally got to the top, I got to see where there used to be a pretty luxurious hotel in the 1800s. The only thing remaining is some of the foundation. Though it would be kind of neat to have a hostel/hotel at the top of the mountain that hikers could stay at. But, I'll have to settle for the Roan High Knob Shelter instead. It's the highest shelter on the AT and unlike most shelters so far, it is completely enclosed with windows, a door, and two levels. It's closer to a cabin than like the other shelters on the trail.
Breakfast: A sundae glass filled with fresh fruit and topped with whipped cream. A glass of milk with chocolate syrup and some cheddar cheese grits. I did like the grits that Cee Cee made better than the other grits I tried, though it's still not my breakfast item of choice.
Lunch: I got to the awesome trail magic around noon. Just in time for lunch. I had two beef tacos with refried beans, lettuce, rice, and cheese. I also had two Capri Suns, a banana, some watermelon, and a chocolate peanut butter brownie.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663367,"Today was another 16+ day. In theory, it shouldn't have been too bad. Across the entire 16 miles, the total ascent was about 2,500 feet and the total decent was about 5,800 feet. So, a lot more downhill than uphill.
Unfortunately, about 1,500 of that 2,500 ascent happened in the span of about 3 miles. This occurred going up Little Hump first, which was about 900 feet, then Hump Mountain about a mile later which was about another 600 feet. It shouldn't have been as bad as Roan the day before because it wasn't as high and it was split up between two different balds instead of just one single climb, but even after having time to process the day, I still think today was harder than yesterday. 
I think two factors played into this. First, I did Roan yesterday. So, I probably wasn't completely recovered from that 3 hour climb. The second was that unlike almost every ascent I've done before, this one was completely in the open. Normally when I'm climbing, I'm in a wooded area so I can't really get a good gauge of how difficult the climb actually is. Little Hump and Hump were not like that at all. You could pretty much see from the bottom of the mountain all the way to the top because there were no trees or anything. So, as you're climbing it you can just look up and tell how far you've gone. Which was usually not as far as you thought. So, I think it just affected me mentally a lot different than all the other climbs I've done. I don't want to downplay it though. Both climbs were difficult on their own. They were very steep and pretty rocky at times, so it really did a number on my feet.
The rest of the hike though was fairly easy. After Hump Mountain, it was almost all downhill right to the Mountain Harbor hostel which is where I'm staying. I was originally going to tent about 3 miles out and arrive in the morning, but decided to just get here today instead. I have a room reserved for tomorrow, but they were fully booked today so I have to tent on their property tonight. But, and this is the main reason I decided to get here today, they are supposed to have the best breakfast on the entire AT and I'll get to have it twice now instead of just once if I had waited until tomorrow to arrive.I have also officially completed the state of North Carolina. Since leaving Georgia, the trail has gone between North Carolina and Tennessee. I permanently crossed into Tennessee about 3 miles ago. From where I'm staying, it's only about 75 miles to Virginia and except for one section, the trail looks like it mellows out a little bit from here to Damascus. Which is good because I'd like to get through Tennessee as quickly as possible.
One thing that might be irritating about tenting here tonight is that it's right next to a road that seems to be pretty busy. Hopefully it calms down at night, but I can already tell I'm going to get woke up in the night because of some passing semi truck or something like that.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663426,"The tenting experience was not as bad as I thought it would be. Whether because I was just tired, the sound of the nearby creek, or just the time of night, I was not woken up by any passing traffic from the nearby road.
Breakfast was served at 8:00am and it was every bit as good as all my expectations hoped it would be. They have definitely earned their reputation as having the best breakfast on the AT.
I took a picture of the counter that was full of food. They had muffins, pastries, quiches, French toast, fruit, sausage, and a bunch of other things as well. If I had to guess, there were probably 25-30 people at breakfast this morning and there was so much food that there was still some left over when everyone was finished. If you leave hungry, it's your own fault.
I had to wait until about 1:00pm before I could check into my room. I didn't really do much. Just kind of hung out. The room I'm staying in is really nice though. I have a few pictures, but it has a large king size bed in the middle of a very specious room. The bathroom has a jacuzzi tub which I took advantage of. I did like the jacuzzi tub at Iron Station better though. This room is inside a house that is the location of the breakfast, as well as two other rooms. I don't know of it's because they all share the same water tank, but I ran out of hot water before I was able to completely fill the jacuzzi so it ended up being more like a warm tub instead of a hot tub.
I didn't do much of anything else for the rest of the day. Dinner ended up being a surprise treat. I had planned to just get something at the food truck/bar that was on property. But, at about 4pm, Steve, a guy I've been hiking with the last few days came up to me and asked if I wanted to go into town. He had been talking with a woman named Venezza who has been section hiking with her car and she had offered to take him into town.
Venezza lives somewhere in Alabama and her and her husband operate a deer processing business. She said that she has to work really hard and put in long hours for about 4 or 5 months a year, but it does well enough that she is basically able to do whatever she wants for the other 7 or 8 months. So, she does a lot of section hiking with her car. She parks her car somewhere along the trail, shuttles either north or south so many miles, hikes to her car, and repeats the process until she finishes her section. I think she said this year she is going from Davenport Gap to Damascus. 
The trip was originally just going to be going to a grocery store because Steve just wanted a salad or something like that. Instead, we ended up going to an Italian restaurant called Bella's. I got spaghetti with meatballs with a bowl of white bean and ham soup. To top it all off, Venezza paid for the entire dinner.","

It looks like I'm going to be hiking with Steve for the foreseeable future. When I make my plans for the next week or so, he seems fine with whatever I decide. It's been nice having someone to hike with and Steve is a good guy, so it's worked out so far.
I haven't gotten to say it often, but the hike today was pretty mild. I was originally going to do about 9 miles and stay at one of the shelters, but even though we didn't start until about 10am, it was only about 3:00pm when we got there. This was even after we took a small side trail to see a pretty neat water fall, then took a side trail to the side trail to go up to the top of the waterfall. The side side trail was a pretty difficult climb. It had some ropes that helped, but it took about 10-15 minutes to get to the top. We did all this without our packs on, so that certainly made it easier. 
Since we did get to the shelter so early, we took about 30 minutes for a break and to get something to eat then I decided I wanted to do a few more miles. I'm now setup in a tent neat Upper Laurel Fork about 4 miles further on.
The one thing I am concerned about is that the last I checked, it was supposed to rain and/or thunderstorm tonight and into the morning. Being in the shelter for that would be ideal. Hopefully if it does rain, it won't be much and it'll be over by morning. 
Unfortunately when we got to Upper Laurel Fork, there was already another group of people here, so we didn't get the best tenting spots. I'm at a spot that my tent just barely fits at, it's a bit unlevel, there's a root underneath it, and there's a slope to the left of it so if it does rain hard, it's going to run right down into my tent area. There is also a rather loud creek to my right. It may be annoying, but perhaps it will act more like a white noise machine and help me sleep better instead.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663713,"The creek didn't seem to affect my sleep one way or the other. I guess it makes sense, even when I'm at home, noise machines were never something I really used.
The good news is that it didn't rain (or if it did, I didn't hear it) during the night. At around 6:00am or so, I got out of my tent to use the restroom and get my bear canister. Now the bad news. As soon as I got back into my tent about 10 minutes later, the thunder and lightning started. About 5 minutes after that, the rain started. So, I got back into my sleeping bag and went back to sleep hoping I could wait it out.
It finally let up enough after about 2 hours that I got out of my tent and was able to start getting everything packed up. I also made sure Steve was awake and we were finally ready to hit the trail at about 9:00am or so.
Steve and I hiked a little ways together, but I had decided that at the very least I was going to get to the top of Pond Flats today and maybe even push all the way to the Boots Off Hostel if I could get a reservation. That would be at least a 17 mile day with a potential of 20. Steve wasn't really interested in doing that many miles, so we parted ways as I sped up so I could get the miles in since we were starting later because of the storm.
There are only a couple of spots on the hike worth mentioning. The first was down to Laural Falls about 13 miles in. That was a very strenuous half mile or so. It started by going pretty much straight down some very suspect stone ""steps."" They weren't nicely cut clean steps. Instead they were basically just stones that were placed somewhat haphazardly in a sort of downward direction. But once down, Laurel Falls was pretty awesome. It's probably the best waterfall I've seen since Amicalola Falls back at the very beginning. But, since I had to go down to get to the falls that meant I had to climb back up further up the trail. First though, the trail did run along the river for a bit and there was one section where the path ran along the stone walls. It was a little difficult to find at first because it was literally just a section of the rock face that had been cut out for the trail. It was about 6 inches wide and on one side was the river and on the other it was just the rock wall.
The other part of the hike worth mentioning was the climb up Ponds Flat. When I got to the shelter a few miles before the start of the climb, I was tired but still feeling okay. I knew it was going to be a tough climb, but I definitely underestimated how tough. I think there were two factors that made it so tough. First, I'd already done 14 miles, so I was tired. Second, and it's now official that I'm complaining about non-cold weather, it was hot and humid enough to make a 3 mile climb feel even more miserable. I had to stop about half a dozen times and rest and I think I drank almost two liters of water on the 3 mile climb alone. 
By this time I knew I was going to go up and over because I had already made a reservation at the Boots Off Hostel. I was hoping for cabin or at least a room in the bunkhouse, but all they had were tent sites. But, it came with a shower, laundry, and breakfast so I was okay with it. By the time I got to the hostel, it was almost 9:00pm. There were sections on the way down Ponds Flat where it got pretty dark because of the trees, but I was pretty much out of the wooded area before it got totally dark. I did get to have an ice cream sandwich at the driveway entrance to the hostel, which was nice. There was a guy who had his RV parked there and when I walked up in the dark, he offered it to me and directed me towards the hostel. 
Then there was one last bit of drama. When I went to check in, apparently there was some kind of mistake because not only had they given my tent site to someone else, they had charged my credit card with the things the people had bought from the store. So, it took a little bit of extra time to get that sorted out, but I was eventually able to get a shower, get something to eat, and give them my laundry to do in the morning. They also had some other open tent areas, so I just ended up at one of those.
I wish I could say that I was able to get to bed pretty soon afterwards, but I ended up staying up a bit later than I would have liked. Part of it was just the need to wind down after a long day of hiking, but I also got to talking to a couple of other hikers. They were each interesting in their own way. I had actually met one of them the day before at a shelter, but we only talked briefly. She was hiking with her Dad and she was very open about some of the mental issues she had. I won't go into details, but she said hiking is basically the one thing that helps with the problems that she's having.
The other person also had some issues, but in a totally different way. He told us several stories, including one about seeing a raven get hit by a car at the NOC. After it got hit, this guy went and sawed the claw off of it, went through the necessary steps to preserve it, and now carries it around with him on the trail. Unfortunately I did not get to see it. He brought it the next morning at breakfast, but I missed it.
He also told us about this girl he had met on the trail. They hooked up (he was very explicit about how many times), she professed her love but also cheated on him with other guys, then somehow by the end of the story she ended up hitching a ride to New Mexico. And all of this happened within a span of about a month or so. It's one of those stories that would take several pages to really do it justice.
I didn't really do my normal food routine. I ate some trail mix for breakfast, started hiking, and then just kind of stopped a few times to snack until I got to the hostel. At the hostel I drank an orange Gatorade (which was given to me for free because of the reservation problems) and a frozen pepperoni pizza.","Upper Laurel Fork

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663762,"One of the deciding factors for doing 20 miles yesterday was the impression I had, based on looking at The AT Guide, that the rest ofnthe way into Damascus would be relatively easier. It was a faulty impression. If the 13 miles I did today was easier, I couldn't tell. Instead of having to go up a single several thousand foot mountain, I had to go up and over several hundreds of feet mountains. It was like being on a really slow roller coaster. I'd go up, get to the top, then come back down just to do it all over again.There were some people at the hostel who did what is known as aquablazing. Much of this section of the trail runs next to Watauga Lake. So, instead of hiking, for a price, the hostel will provide you with kayaks and you can kayak about 21 miles instead of hiking. Once you get to your destination, the hostel picks you up and brings you back to the hostel for the night. The next day, they then drop you off at the spot where you finished aquablazing.It sounds like a good time, but I admit, and I want to iterate that this is just for me and is not a judgment on anyone else's choice, it seems like cheating. I decided I was going to hike the entire thing, so that's what I'm going to do.It's a similar feeling I have towards the idea of me slackpacking. That's when a hostel will either drop you off further up the trail, then you hike back to the hostel or you hike some distance and the hostel picks you up when you're finished. The catch though is that since you'll be staying at the hostel that night again, you don't have to carry anything other than water, some food, and a few other items. Oftentimes the hostel will even provide a lighter day pack specifically for slackpacking. Again, I'm not judging anyone else's choice. We're all out here for different reasons and have different goals. For me, I'm going to try and do it with my full pack the entire way.
Not much of note happened on the hike itself. Apparently I did just miss seeing a rattlesnake though. When I got to the Vandeventer shelter there was a woman already there and she said she had seen a rattlesnake just up the trail not too long ago. I think she said it was about a half hour before I got there. It would have been cool to see, but my luck I wouldn't have seen it and it would have bitten me as I went past it.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663765,"Today was what I thought yesterday was going to be like. For the most part, it was a pretty mild hike. Not a lot of ups and downs. I was pretty beat when I got to the shelter and towards the end the terrain did start to get a little more difficult. But I think some of my issues are a combination of the miles I've done the last few days, the heat, and not getting enough calories. Once I get to Damascus, I'm going to get more food and I'm also going to dial back my mileage a bit. 
I'm thinking about doing a 15/4 rule. I'll either hike about 15 miles or until 4:00pm, whichever comes first. Hopefully that will give me more time to rest and relax. It should also give me time to fix two dinners instead of one so I can get more calories. The extra food will increase my pack weight, buy hopefully not a lot.
I did finally cross paths with the single mother who is out here with her 15 kids. I'd heard about them almost since the beginning of the trail. I didn't say much to them except hello. Both times we crossed paths, I was either hiking past them while they were stopped or they hiked past me while I was stopped. You can Google them if you're interested in learning more about them.
The shelter that I'm staying at tonight has had bear problems the last couple of nights according to the FarOut comments. One person had their food sack crushed by bear teeth overnight, another person saw a bear hanging around at about noon, and the shelter journal was all torn up and in pieces around the area.
The story that I heard is that some hunters some time ago started scattering dog food around the shelter so that they could easily kill them during bear hunting season. Well, between the time they did this and when hunting season began, the mama bear taught the cubs where to find food. So now these bears associate the shelter with a place to get food. I don't know if it's true or not, but it certainly wouldn't surprise me if it was. I've got a bear canister, so I don't have to hang anything, but there are other people here who do, so hopefully they don't get there food taken. Though I guess the silver lining is that if a bear does steal some food tonight, we'll be in Damascus tomorrow so no one will have to go long without food.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663772,"As far as I know, there was no bear activity at the shelter last night. However, I did wake up around 1:00am and while I was awake I did hear some very loud noises coming from around and behind the shelter. It was enough that I did consider getting up to investigate, but decided against it. There was only one other person in the shelter with me (the other people were tenting about 75 yards away) so I just decided that if it was a bear, it could do what it wanted as long as it did it away from me. So, I went back to sleep.
I then proceeded to have a dream about a bear being in the camp. I got out of the shelter and the bear got spooked and started to run away. Only, this bear didn't actually look like a bear. The best way I can describe it is some kind of bear like thing that had gray skin that was almost like either a rhinoceros skin or a gray metal plated skin. Anyway, for whatever reason the bear couldn't run away because there was something blocking its escape route so it turned around towards me. At this point I tried to wake up the other guy in the shelter up, but no matter what I did, he just wouldn't wake up. I shook him and pulled his whole body out of the shelter, but he just kept sleeping. And I remember just saying bear, bear, bear, bear, over and over again louder and louder. At this point I woke up and I'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure I yelled bear out loud at least once as I was waking up. No one heard me though, so I can't confirm it.
One other thing I forgot to mention yesterday was that there was a section hiker tenting nearby. He informed all of us that if we did see a bear that we should yell bear out loud because he was carrying a gun and would shoot it into the air to try and scare it away. Another reason why I'm glad there was no bear.
During my hike today I hit another milestone. I have permanently left the state of Tennessee and I'm now in the state of Virginia. I may have already said this in another entry, but the longest section of the AT is in Virginia. It begins (if you're heading north like me) at mile 467.0 and ends at mile 1023.7. So, about 550 miles (there is a small section that crossed into West Virginia for a few miles). The bad news is that's a long ways. The good news is that once Virginia is complete, I'll be almost half way done.
From the border, it was only another couple of miles to Damascus and it was almost all downhill. I ended up getting into town around 10:30. Since I went past it on the waybto the hostel I was staying at, I stopped at the Damascus Diner for lunch. I ended up having lunch with some ofnthe people I had met at the shelter the previous night. I got a BBQ bacon cheeseburger with fries and some green beans. It definitely hit the spot.
After getting checked in at Lady Di's B&B, I just relaxed for a while. The plan was to meet the same group from lunch at Wicked Chicken for dinner. Before that though, I did go into town to the Main Street Coffee & Cream and got two scoops of Cow Tippin ice cream in a waffle cone. It was basically vanilla ice cream with caramel swirl and some kind of chunks in it.
At the Wicked Chicken, the group I was supposed to meet up with were running late so I ended up sitting with another group that was also staying at Lady Di's. I was a little disappointed with what I ordered. I got the boneless honey BBQ wings with a bowl of chicken enchilada soup. The wings had almost no sauce on them. I think that place was biased against boneless wings, because someone else had ordered regular wings with honey BBQ and they looked amazing. The soup was really good though and for a reason I never did figure out, I got a cup and a bowl of soup instead of just the bowl I had originally ordered.
I'm going to be staying in Damascus for three nights. I decided the extra zero would be good for me. I'll get to eat some good food for a few days (and as much of it as I can get) and give my body an extra day to recover. Tomorrow I'm going to resupply and get some new shoes. After that I'll just try and rest and relax for the rest of my stay here.","Abingdon Gap Shelter

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663776,"Breakfast here was really good. Di made some kind of quiche, blueberry bread, and fried potatoes. I haven't really talked to her a lot, but she completed her thru-hike in 2019. She apparently fell in love with Damascus and decided to open up a B&B here. I think 2021 was the year it opened.
I got a new pair of shoes. My old ones were just too small and I was afraid that if I kept hiking in them, I would do permanent damage to my toes and feet. The shoes I got are basically the same shoes, but I went from a size 10.5 to a size 11.5. I could immediately tell the difference. When I walk, my toes no longer feel like they are jamming into the front of my shoe. I'm also hoping this relieves some of the Achilles pain that I've been having. I won't know for sure until I get back on the trail though.
Dinner ended up being fantastic. The seven other people that I'd had dinner with the night before all decided that we'd have a cookout. So, when we all went to the store for our resupply, between all of us we also got pork chops, squash, asparagus, onions, pineapple, watermelon, grapes, chips, and pie. We cooked it up and it was delicious. I missed having a home cooked meal.After dinner we all sat out on the porch and had a very wide ranging discussion/ debate on all the subjects you're not supposed to talk about. It was great and I'm a little sad that they are leaving tomorrow. They are coming back for trail days, so while they are here I may end up catching up to them depending on how far they are going each day.","

I mostly stayed at the hostel and was just lazy.The only time I left was to go get lunch at the diner and a few more things I needed from the outfitter store. At the diner I got the lunch BBQ plate which was just a plate of pulled pork with hushpuppies and two sides. I got fried cabbage and green beans. Everything was good except the beans. Which baffles me because they were really good when I got them the first day I was here. Dinner tonight was a very far step down from yesterday. I didn't feel like leaving again, so I ended up just microwaving a bowl of Chef Boyardee mini beef ravioli. I had that, a piece of chocolate pie from yesterday, and a Virgil's root beer.

I don't know why it was so difficult to keep going, but I got to a trail junction that either continued on the AT or went to the Virginia Creeper Trail back towards Damascus and just sat down for about 20 minutes trying to decide what I wanted to do. I ultimately decided I would get to the next shelter which was about 2 miles ahead and call it a day and see how i feel tomorrow. I'm feeling better now, but I still haven't decided whether or not I'm going to go home tomorrow or not. I'll wait until morning to decide for sure.
I think the main issue that I'm having is that I've realized that I don't really like backpacking. At least not for multiple days at a time. I like modern conveniences like indoor plumbing, a bed, and being able to shower daily. There are things out here that I really love. Many of the views are amazing, the community aspect of the AT is fantastic, and I've met some really great people. Usually I can tolerate the hiking enough to get through it, but it does seem to be getting more difficult.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664083,"I woke up this morning feeling the same, if not leaning more towards quitting, than last night. The weather was not hiker friendly. It had rained pretty hard on and off all night and didn't let up much once the sun came up. So, I decided that I would stay at the shelter for one more day since it was supposed to be nice tomorrow and then probably go home on Wednesday. I even typed up a text message to my Mom to let her know, but because of bad reception, it wouldn't send.
Then at around 11:00am my mood began to change. I was all by myself at this point just laying in my quilt. I knew the next shelter was only about 7 miles away, so at about 11:30 I started packing up my things and was hiking again about noon. And all in all it was a pretty easy hike. I think it was around 3:00pm when I got to the shelter and by then, my thoughts of getting off had receded. They aren't completely gone, but it's at least manageable 
I have no good explanation for any of it. I think it's possible, though I've never been diagnosed, that I have a mild form of depression and sometimes it just becomes a little overwhelming. Even before I started hiking the AT, I would get into similar emotional  ruts. I'd compare it to putting a filter on a camera. When I feel this way, it's like there's an emotional filter that just causes me to experience reality in a much more negative way than I normally would. Fortunately, so far I've been able to at least handle it enough that I haven't made any rash decisions. Each time I've told myself I'd get somewhere, take a few days to make sure it's what I really want, and both times I've been able to move past it.
I have joined up with Steve again. He actually showed up at the Saunders Shelter yesterday and he's also staying at the Lost Mountain  Shelter I'm at tonight. 
I'm hoping the next few shelter stops will be pretty empty because a lot of people will be in Damascus for Trail Days. It's something that I would like to go to, but I just don't want to shuttle back and waste the extra days attending. If and when I get to Katahdin, I will probably come back next year so that I can enjoy it without having to worry about lost hiking days.
It didn't rain at all during my hike and for most of the afternoon and early evening it was pretty nice out. But, starting around 7:00pm it started thundering and shortly after the rain started. It is still raining as I'm typing this. Hopefully it's finished by morning.
Because of the emotional roller coaster I was on today, I didn't eat breakfast until late and I only hiked for about 3 hours and it was first dinner by the time I got to the shelter.

The hike today started out really difficult. It was a 1,500 foot climb over about 2.5 miles. It's another one of those climbs that just feels like it goes on forever. But, once I got to the top, it was fairly easy for about 5 or 6 miles. Then once I got to Elk Garden, it got moderately difficult again all the way to Thomas Knob Shelter where I'm staying. It ended up being about 1,300 feet over about 4 miles. Not terrible, but still quite a bit uphill.
I did take a 0.5 mile side trail that led to the summit of Mt. Rogers. I believe it is the highest point on the AT in Virginia. The biggest reason I went up there is because there is a geological survey marker and I'm trying to get photographs of as many of them as I can. If you look in my photo gallery, you'll see the ones I've got so far.

There also may have been some pony poop in my second dinner. So, for the past few days, my first dinner has always been a freeze dried meal. Then I use the bag to warm up my second dinner. Well, today the bag was sitting on the table and the wind caught it and blew it on to the ground.

""You know Argonaut honey, you've worked really hard this past month and a half. I know there's been a couple times you've thought about quitting, but you overcame those negative feeling and soldiered on and made it to 500 miles (I know it's technically only 499, but you've done some bonus miles, so I'm going to give it to you). Congratulations!!
You know what? I'm going to do something special for you. I see that you're planning on 16 miles today. Now, I'm going to start you off a little tough, but I promise it'll be worth it. I'm going to take you through some of the most gorgeous scenery you've seen yet. And there will be ponies, and cows, and bears. And just for you, not for any other hikers, I'm going to have a pony, a cow, and a bear fight each other because I know how awesome you think that would be. But don't you worry your pretty little head off, they won't actually hurt each other. No, once you leave they will go back to drinking tea and eating biscuits because all the animals around here are secretly British. 
Now, once you see all that, it's going to be all downhills and level surfaces all the way to the shelter. Now, I can't do anything about the rocks and roots along the way. Those left wing hippies just go on and on about the trees and the environment. What can you do, am I right? Of course I am. But, they'll be plenty of great water sources and I'll even throw in a trash can because I know how you hikers love to get rid of your trash. Every little bit of weight removed helps!!
So enjoy today's hike and I look forward to being there for you for another 1,700 miles.""
Instead, this is the AT that I got:
""Hey AR-GO-NOT. For 499 miles (499? You're literally carrying a shelter on your back and you just had to stay at the provided one so badly that you couldn't go one extra mile. Some thru-hiker you are.) you've walked all over me, urinated on me, defecated on me, and you know what, I'M SICK OF IT.
So here's what I'm gonna do. I see your stupid a** has decided to do 16 miles today. Well, I'm gonna start your idiot self going uphill. I'm going to take you through some of the most gorgeous scenery you've ever seen, BUT, I'm gonna cover that s*** in a blanket of fog so you can't see nuthin. And just to screw with you, because I know you're broken eyed a** will eventually have to take your glasses off, I'm gonna wait until you do and then you're gonna look around and BOO, there's gonna be a cow there that wasn't there when you walked past 10 seconds ago. It's not gonna do a thing except look at you with shame and disappointment in its eyes until it silently walks away into the mist.
Oh and I know how much you want to see some ponies. So, I'm gonna drop two of them stubborn equines right smack in the middle of  the trail and the only way you'll be able to get around is by trudging your a** through the tick infested brush. I hope you get lymn disease and become allergic to red meat a******.
Then, I'm gonna make you think you're coming up on a trash can, because I know how much you dumb hikers just LOVE getting rid of your 0.5 ounces of trash, as if that makes any damn difference, only to find out NOPE, it's a bear box sucker!! HA HA HA HA!!
And here's the best part. I'm gonna make most of the trail pretty easy. Oh it'll still be rocky and rooty as hell, wouldn't want to give up the game by making it too easy. And you'll be walkin along with a stupid grin on your face saying to yourself 'gee, today has been pretty easy and I'm making great time', but then right as your nearing the end and your feet are starting to get a little sore... BAM... hike uphill 950 feet for two miles!!! Have fun with that! HA HA HA HA! Oh, and by the way, hike uphill to the shelter also b****""
All joking aside, today's hike was actually really good. Even with the fog, the Grayson Highlands are probably my favorite spot I've been so far. The fog even added a sort of eerie atmosphere, which was neat (for about 10 minutes anyway, then I wanted it to go away). If and when I come back next year for Trail Days, I may start at the Highlands and hike from there into Damascus. 
Speaking of Trail Days, it's a very large hiker festival that is held in Damascus every year. I don't know what the population of Damascus is normally, but I wouldn't think it's more than a couple thousand. Well, Trail Days brings in an average of about 20,000 people. Major vendors show up, there's a hiker parade, there's tent city where everyone who is staying sets up their tents. It's basically a party for several days from what I've heard.
Unfortunately I already passed Damascus, so I won't be going this year. There are people who shuttle back in order to attend, but I'd rather just keep hiking forward. I'll come back next year when I am not so concerned about my average miles and whether or not I'll have enough time to make it to Katahdin.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664086,"At least for the past two days, Virginia has started to live up to its reputation as being at least easier, though still not easy.
The biggest difference between Virginia so far and the previous 500 miles is that instead of going up for 800 feet, then down 700, then back up 400, rinse and repeat for 15 miles a day, I'll go up a few hundred feet and oftentimes once I reach the top, the trail will follow a ridgeline and stay relatively flat for several miles. It's why I was able to do 19 miles today in 9 hours. The only real tough section was about 11 miles in. It wasn't too steep, but it was very rocky. And the rocks were either small or angled so that the sharp edge was sticking up. So, it was difficult to get a good pace going because I had to constantly pay attention to where I was stepping. The rocks also do quite a number on the bottoms of my feet. 
My original plan was to get into Marion on Saturday, so I was going to stop at a tent site about 6 miles away on Friday and have a short hike the next day. We'll, then I found out that the Partnership shelter was the shelter you could have pizza delivered to. That was something I just had to experience, so I changed plans and hiked the extra six miles. It will also get me into Marion earlier and make tomorrow basically a zero day because the hostel that I'm staying at picks up from the Partnership shelter area. It also worked out because I was starting to run low on food, since I spent that extra day earlier getting my head straight. 
The shelter itself is very near the Mount Roger's visitor center, which is on a main road that goes into Marion about 3 miles away, which is why you can get pizza delivered. Well, when I got there, another hiker had already ordered food. The pizza place will only deliver to the shelter area if the total is over $30, so this hiker had a bunch of extra pizza, cheesy bread, and Pepsi so I got to eat some of that as an appetizer. Later, I ordered more pizza, some chicken wings, and Mountain Dew. Total, I think I ended up eating a whole 14"" pizza, a liter of Pepsi, a half a liter of Mountain Dew, and three chicken wings.
Breakfast: Two blueberry fig bars and an apple breakfast bar 
Lunch: A packet of Starkist BBQ chicken, some Terry's trail mix, and two Little Debbie apple pies
First Dinner: About half of a meat pizza from Pizza Perfect and half a liter of Pepsi. 
Second Dinner: About 3/4 of a Hawaiian pizza, three honey BBQ boneless wings, half a liter of Mountain Dew, and a large cup of Pepsi that the delivery driver had extra.
The pizza was decent. Not the best I've had, but better than whatever I would have eaten otherwise. They did forget to provide cups and eating utensils though, so I had to drink the Mountain Dew from the bottle and eat the wings with my pretty dirty fingers.","Hurricane Mountain Shelter

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664211,"Today was essentially a zero day since I hiked the extra miles to the Partnership Shelter yesterday. The hostel that I'm staying at picked us up from the Mt. Rogers Visitor Center and drove us the 3 miles into town.
There was a minor snafu with the shuttle. When I originally made the reservation for the hostel, I had planned to camp about 6 miles away and hike in the next morning. The hostel owner said there was no cell reception at the visitor center, but I should have one a few miles beforehand. He said to text him when I got a signal and he'd have someone waiting when I arrived.
Well, since I was going to hike the extra six miles and stay at the Partnership Shelter (which is pretty much right next to the visitor center), I tried to call him while I was on the trail, but he didn't answer. So, I tried to text him to find out the earliest he could pick me up, but couldn't wait around for a response, so I just had to hope he'd get it and that I would at some point while hiking get a signal again to read it.
I never did get a signal and he was mostly right about not having reception at the visitor center. But, once or twice I must have gotten a good enough signal to recieve texts because I did get his response and was able to reply back that I would be ready at 7:30am the next morning.
To shorten this already long story a little, the shuttle didn't show up at 7:30am because he wrote the day down wrong or something. Fortunately, Steve ended up staying at the Partnership Shelter also and he was able to text him using his Garmin, which uses satellite instead of cell towers. So, we were able to get into town at about 9:00am.
Marion was a pretty decent sized town (compared to other trail towns anyway). It was big enough to have a Wal-Mart, a couple grocery stores, and some fast food places. So, it was a good resupply town.
The hostel (The Merry Hiker Inn) was very nice. It was on the second floor of the owners outfitter store and you got to it from a set of stairs that led to the sidewalk. Unfortunately I completely forgot to take pictures.
Other than resupplying and trying to relax a little, the only other thing I did was eat. Since we got in early enough for breakfast, we went to a restaurant called Downtown Pioneer. I got French toast, scrambled eggs, sausage, hashbrowns, and baked apples. I felt the same way about breakfast as I did about the pizza yesterday. It wasn't the best, but it was better than fig bars or other breakfast bars that I would have had.
For lunch we went to a Japanese place called Yummy Yummy. I got some sort of chicken and steak dish with fried rice and some sweet buns. It was okay, but I doubt I'd eat there again.
For dinner a bunch of us went to the Wooden Pickle. Apparently the Wood family and the Pickle family are (or maybe were) a big deal in Marion, so the name of the restaurant is just a combination of the two family names. I actually wasn't that hungry because we didn't leave for dinner until late and about 30 minutes beforehand I drank almost a quart of chocolate milk. But, I did get a pear and blue cheese salad with chicken and it was a solid choice.","

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664244,"The shuttle logistics were much better this morning than yesterday. Since we knew we weren't going far today, we decided to start later. I think it was close to 9:00am when we got back on the trail.
The hike itself was pretty uneventful. The first four or five miles were a little tough, but after that it leveled out pretty good. Although, a few miles in I did take a tumble. I didn't trip over anything, but for whatever reason my feet went one way and my body went another and I lost my balance and fell. Fortunately I just fell into a bed of leaves and only got a few scratches. Really, if I was going to fall, it was a really good place to do so because most of the rest of that section, both before and after, was very rocky. So, it could have been a lot worse.
I did stop at an old farmhouse that was just a little ways off the trail. I think it was built in the 1890's. It was interesting to see and it did have a working water pump. The farmhouse may have been part of the Settlers Museum, but I'm not positive because it was about a quarter mile up the trail. 
The Settlers Museum was kind of cool. There was an old schoolhouse that was open. I did get a little excited because there was a sign that said there was trail magic inside, but that sign was a lie. There were some other houses and buildings on the property as well, but they were all closed. The visitor center was open and a gentleman inside said when they have volunteers, they give tours but there were none today.
Between the farmhouse and the Settlers Museum I also went under one of the noisiest power lines I've ever heard. Before I got to it, I thought someone was weed whacking some grass somewhere. 
Tonight I'm staying at The Long Neck Lair which is a hostel that is on an alpaca farm. I took some pictures and a video and will upload them when I can. I haven't stayed in many bunkhouses, so I don't have much to compare it to, but talking to some of the other hikers, I get the impression that this was one of the nicer ones.
There were about 4 double stacked beds and they were all attached to the wall of the building. So, one side of the bed was completely closed off. The other side had a 3/4 wall and a curtain on the other 1/4, so when you were in your bunk you could have some privacy. Each bunk had two light switches that controlled a built in light and a fan. Each bunk also had an outlet for charging your electronics.
They do offer breakfast, but it's just some cereal, donuts, and other cold items like that. But, at $35, I think it's a really nice place to stay. Oh, apparently there is also a rooster that likes to sound off at 4:30 in the morning. Fortunately the owner has earplugs available, so hopefully between them and the white noise of the bunk fan, I won't get rudely woken up before I'm ready.
Breakfast: Two individual cups of maple and brown sugar oatmeal and some pineapple. 
Lunch: Terry's trail mix, an oatmeal cream pie, and some Jolly Ranchers. 
Snack 1: I bought a bag of Doritos and a fruit punch Gatorade from the museum visitor center
First Dinner: Chicken and dumplings, green beans, a croissant, and a Pepsi at Sweetwater Venue. This was before the hostel, so i stopped here before checking in. It was good, but I'd take Cracker Barrel over them given the choice. 
Snack 2: Some peanut butter crackers that were on the table at the hostel. 
Second Dinner: Chicken Feliz from El Burrito Loco. It was grilled chicken with grilled pineapple and it came with beans, rice, and a couple tortillas. It was a Mexican restaurant attached to a gas station and I thought there food was better than Sweetwater. I also had a root beer and some Cheesecake Factory strawberry ice cream that I got from the gas station.","VA-16

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664246,"I wouldn't say I slept great, but I do think I slept better than I have for a while. Between the privacy wall/curtain, ear plugs, and fan, I didn't hear a thing all night. No tossing and turning, no snoring, no noisy cock, nothing.
The only noteworthy about the hike is that several times I had to climb over these wooden contraptions that went over some barbed wire fencing. It's a bit of a chore when you've got 40 lbs strapped to your back. Apparently putting in a gate is asking for too much.Actually, I also officially crossed the 25% threshold. I've done 1/4th of the AT.
I'm staying at the Bear Garden Hostel tonight. Steve and I rented the private house they have available and it's quaint. It's about 100 years old and it used to be some kind of grain store. Well, at some point they moved the whole building by putting it on some logs. When you walk around the place, you can feel where the logs are at.
On the note I'll say that I know it isn't sustainable, but I really like knowing that at the end of my hike, I'll have at least a shower, laundry, and a bed waiting. If I had more money, I would almost certainly do this as many times as feasible all the way to Maine.

Lunch: Terry's trail mix, an oatmeal cream pie, and some Jolly Ranchers 
Drink Experiment: Powdered Ovaltine mixed with powdered goat milk. It wasn't terrible, but the goat milk doesn't dissolve all the way so there are chunks of it left. Still, I think it'll make a good recovery drink. 
First Dinner: Good To-Go Chicken Pho. Since I'm staying at hostels, it's easy to not eat my packed food. Unfortunately that means I have to carry it the next day, so I'm trying to lighten my load a little.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664323,"I forded my first river today. It took about two hours to cut down some trees and lash them together to make a raft. After that I loaded myself and my pack onto it, I used a branch and floated across the 50 foot expanse of water. Fortunately the currents were mild and I did not tip over. So, all of my buffalo and deer meat, clothing, and bullets remained safe and nobody drowned or died of dysentery. 
In reality, the river was more like a creek, it was only about 10 feet across, and never got more than ankle deep. There used to be a bridge, but apparently it got washed away in 2020 and they haven't gotten around to fixing it yet. So, I took my shoes and socks off, put on my Crocs, rolled up my pants, and walked across. The water was pretty cold, but it felt good on my feet so I stood in it for a few minutes before continuing. Afterwards I sat down for about 15 minutes so my feet could dry, put my socks and shoes back on, and went on with the rest of my hike.
I'm staying at Burke's Garden Hostel tonight. It was almost a mile off trail down a rocky/gravelly road that turned into an asphalt road, but fortunately he offers free shuttles back up to the trail in the morning. 
It's a renovated Amish pole barn and seems very nice. There's a large common area downstairs and some floor beds upstairs. I haven't tested them yet, but people on FarOut say they are very comfortable. In the mornings there is a waffle bar, so I'm interested to see what that is all about.

",Walker Gap/Burke's Garden Hostel,"May 23, Tue",12.70
Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664441,"Burke's Garden ended up being a pretty decent place to stay. It is only about two years old and you can tell. Everything still looks pretty new and clean. Hopefully the owners can maintain that.
The waffle bar was really just a make your own waffle in the morning thing. It's been  while since I've used a waffle iron. I ended up putting too much batter in the thing and I also undercooked it. So, it wasn't great.
Steve wasn't sure last night if he was going to hike the 20 miles that I was going to hike to get to the next hostel, but by morning he had made up his mind to do it.
So, the hostel owner drove us back to the trailhead (it's about a .75 miles downhill walk off trail to his place and he offers rides back up the next morning for those who stay overnight) and we started hiking at about 7:45am. Unfortunately not too far into the hike, we missed a turn and hiked probably about a quarter mile on the wrong trail. I should have known when it was mostly downhill.
But, after that mishap the rest of the hike was good, but long. There were quite a few flat areas, with one that ran for probably a good 5 or 6 miles. Of course that was after a fairly brutal climb up to it.
After the 20 mile hike, we got picked up near US-52 and we're staying at The Weary Feet Hostel tonight and tomorrow. 
The worst thing about doing a big mile day isn't really the miles and the soreness that comes along with it. That's all usually better by the morning. No, the worst thing is that I end up getting to where I'm going much later and I don't have as much time to just decompress from the days hike.
I got to the pickup spot at about 5:45pm, Steve got there about 45 minutes later, and by the time the shuttle arrived and dropped us off at the hostel, it was past 7:30. After dinner and a shower, it's now past 9:00pm and time for bed. So, I just didn't have much time to just kick my feet up and relax for a bit. Hopefully tomorrow I'll have a little more time to unwind because we're going to get dropped off where we got picked up and slackpack the 18 or so miles back to the hostel. 
I think in a previous post, I did say that I had no interest in slackpacking, but circumstances have changed and it wouldn't make sense not to do it.
So today we started near Walker Gap at mile marker 571.2. We hiked to 20.6 miles to mile 591.8 and got picked up by The Weary Feet Hostel, which is off mile 609.9. Notice that The Weary Feet Hostel is further ahead on the trail, by 18.1 miles, from where we got picked up. Since I'm staying here tomorrow also, it doesn't make sense to carry anything more than a days worth of things. So, that is what I'm going to do tomorrow. The only issue might be when we start. Breakfast is at 7 and the drive to the drop off point is about 25 minutes. So, we might not be able to start until close to 9. Not ideal for an 18 mile day.
Breakfast: An undercooked waffle.
Lunch: Two packets of Starkist teriyaki chicken, two oatmeal cream pies.

Dinner: A basic salad with Italian dressing, a dinner roll, and a large plate of spaghetti with meat sauce at The Weary Feet Hostel.

",US-52/The Weary Feet Hostel,"May 24, Wed",20.60
Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664442,"So we had a few things happen this morning that delayed our start time. First, I really wanted some chocolate milk when I finished my hike, so I asked Robert, our shuttle driver, about it and he said he'd take us to the Dollar General in Vland, VA. So, that was about a 15 minute detour. 
The bigger problem happened after he dropped us off. We started hiking and about 10 minutes in I realized that I didn't have my phone. So, Steve had to call Julie at the hostel so she could call Robert. Fortunately my phone was in his car, but we had to wait about 20 minutes for him to drive back to where we were.
So, by the time all that got resolved, it was about 9:30am before we actually started the hike. But, we were slackpacking and having finished, I understand why people like to do it so much. There is a world of difference between carrying 30+ lbs and carrying about 10 lbs. Today I was able to do 18 miles in about 7 hours. Part of that was definitely the terrain because there were a lot of flat sections, but because I didn't have so much weight, I was also able to go faster for longer periods of time.
During the hike I think I may have spotted my first bear. We were walking when all of a sudden I hear a shuffling noise and see this shape go darting through the brush. I didn't get a good look at it, but it seemed too small for a deer, so I think it may have been a smaller younger bear. Though I did see several deer along the trail and they were all pretty close encounters. 
The only other thing worth mentioning is that I ended up running quite a bit of the last 3 miles and I looked absolutely ridiculous doing it. 
Because I've lost so much weight since I've started, my pants have gotten too big. Normally it's not too big of a deal because I use the waist belt on my backpack to keep my pants up. Well, I didn't use my pack today, instead I used a smaller loaner pack provided by the hostel and it doesn't have a waist belt, so my pants kept falling down the entire hike.
Anyway, while I was running, to keep my pants in place, I had to grab them with my left hand which also held my hiking poles. So, here I am running down the trail grabbing my pants with trekking poles sticking behind me and I can just imagine how comical the whole thing must have looked. There were a few people that I went by who got to witness it, so I'm sure they had a good laugh about it.
Breakfast: Scrambled eggs, sausage, and pancakes from The Weary Feet Hostel. 
Lunch: A large packet of Starkist white chicken, a packet of Starkist BBQ chicken, and two oatmeal pies.
Recovery Drink: A half gallon of chocolate milk. There was a bit of a mix up with the milk. When I bought it this morning, it was supposed to be waiting for me at the hostel. Instead it got delivered to Julie's house, so when I got back, she had to go get it which took about 20 minutes. Not a huge deal, but I normally like to drink soon after I get done.
Dinner: Pork tenderloin, mashed potatoes with gravy, and corn at The Weary Feet Hostel. The pork was a little dry, but everything else was solid.
Dessert: A piece of red velvet cake at The Weary Feet Hostel. It was good, but the chocolate cake I had yesterday was better.","US-52

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664543,"There were no setbacks this morning and I was able to get on the trail pretty soon after breakfast. I did have to walk probably about 3/4 of a mile from the hostel to where the trail began which is always kind of a pain since it's basically miles that don't count.
There was a little bit of a climb at the start, but for the majority of the morning it was a very level walk. Still, I was feeling a little sluggish. I think the previous two days of hiking wore me out quite a bit and I wasn't fully recovered. There was a shelter right before a big climb, so I stopped there for lunch and rested for about 30-40 minutes. 
The climb was about 1600 feet over a 4 mile stretch, but a significant chunk was in about the first 2, so it was fairly steep to start with. It did get more gradual, but I was still pretty tired  when I finally made it to the top. After the climb it was pretty much downhill to the hostel.
The hostel is call Woods Hole and it's one of the oldest hostels on the trail. The sleeping arrangements are pretty standard, but the thing that sets it apart and makes it a popular stopping place is that all the meals are home-cooked organic vegetarian food. They have a small garden out front that they use to create their salads. For dinner we had fresh baked bread, fresh picked salad, brown rice, and Chana Masala (chickpea curry). It was all very delicious and I can understand why this place is so popular.
Steve enjoyed it so much that we are going to stay here another day. Originally we were going to hike to Pearisburg and stay at a hostel in town, but now we are going to slackpack into Pearisburg and then shuttle back to Woods Hole for the night. It's only about 12 miles, so I'm hoping the relatively short distance and light pack weight will help my legs out a bit.

The hike to Pearisburg was uneventful. Though despite the fact that I said I wasn't going to slackpack at all, I'm now going to do it three times in four days. And I'm glad for it for a couple of reasons. First, it's better for my joints and tendons because I'm not carrying as much weight. Second, and I think more importantly, it keeps me hiking with other people. I really enjoyed my hike today because I had multiple people to talk to. It made it more pleasant and it kept me out of my head for a while.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664714,"This morning was about 99%, not really misery, but just trying not to let the situation become emotionally overwhelming. Even though I knew it was probably going to rain all day, I decided to join Pacer, The Professor, and St.Paul on a potential 21 mile slackpacking hike. No rain, no Maine I guess.
The first hour or so wasn't terrible. It was raining, but it was fairly light and the tree cover kept me from getting completely soaked. But as the morning wore on, it began raining much harder and it didn't take long after that to become completely soaked through. Fortunately it wasn't too cold, so like I said, I wasn't completely miserable, but it was still not an enjoyable time. 
However, there was one moment that almost made me forget the rain. We were walking along a fairly narrow, flat, wooded section of the trail with me in the front and Pacer close behind. All of a sudden this tiny fawn, it couldn't have been more than a week or two old, steps out of the brush right in front of me. I stop, a little startled, and just look at it for a few moments. Like us, it's wet and shivering and just looked miserable. The momma deer was no where to be seen. I didn't really know what to do, so I just stepped around it and started walking again. After a few steps, I turn around and the fawn is following me. I stop and the fawn stops. I start walking again and the fawn starts following me again. It stayed right behind me for probably close to 5 or 10 minutes. We finally came to a tree stump that I had to step over and though it tried to climb over, it wasn't big enough and steady enough to make it. So it kind of moved around a bit, I think trying to find another way around. I admit, part of me wanted to pick it up and help it over, but in the end it was a wild animal and I didn't think it was a good idea. Besides, what am I supposed to do with a deer anyway. A few moments after this, The Professor walked up and it got a little startled and went back into the brush. But it was definitely one of the weirdest and coolest things I've experienced. And the good news is that Pacer got both pictures and some video. Once I'm able to get them from her, I'll post them.
The rest of the hike was uneventful. The rain did eventually stop and the sun even came out for a little while. We also decided to cut our hike by about a mile since we didn't feel we were going as fast as we'd like. So, it was about 5:15pm when we arrived at the shuttle that would take us back to the hostel. 
At this point the plan was to get a rotisserie chicken and some things to go along with it from the nearby Food Lion for dinner. However, Pacer was convinced that because it was Memorial Day and Steve and some other people were taking a zero, that they would be making something for dinner. So, The Professor and I got dropped off at Food Lion (it's about a 5 minute walk from there to the hostel) and Pacer went back and would call us to let us know. And sure enough she was right. Steve and the others went all out and prepared an amazing dinner. There was oven baked chicken, roasted cabbage, corn, red cabbage, green beans, rice, and some kind of curry. While we were at Food Lion we got an apple pie, a chocolate satin pie, and two key lime pies (I thought I had gotten banana cream, but I accidentally got a second key lime) for dessert. The whole thing was fantastic and it was a great way to end the day.

The Professor also slackpacked with us the 11+ miles, but when we got to where the shuttle was to pick us up, he continued on. He is meeting his wife tomorrow further up the trail and getting off for a few days to go see his granddaughter's dance recital.
The hike was pretty easy. It was very similar to a few days ago. It started with a decent climb, then stayed level most of the way, before decending back down. There was about a two mile stretch along the ridgeline at the top that was very rocky. Not tiny stones, but large flat, usually not horizontal rocks. It was a little slower going during this section. 
The weather wasn't as terrible as yesterday, but it did rain a little towards the beginning of our hike and a little towards the end.
Speaking of yesterday's rain. It certainly caused some problems for quite a few people from what I heard. One section hiker's car got flooded and several people got stuck at The Weary Feet Hostel because the nearby creek flooded the road. I guess this is the kind of thing you have to deal with when you live in a valley.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664803,"We slackpacked almost 14 miles, but by the end I felt like we did 20. Since we cooked dinner last night, I didn't really get to relax much so I think that may have played a part.We did skip a section of the trail though. At the very beginning of where we would have started today (where we ended yesterday) there was a creek that used to have a bridge crossing. Well, it got washed out three years ago and because of all the rain the past few days, we didn't want to risk crossing it. There was a detour, but it was along a road that people fly down, so this morning we just had the shuttle driver take us to where the detour ended. It cut about 7 miles out, but I don't care.
However, I did do the first part of the so called Virginia triple crown. There are three ""must see"" points of interest along the trail in Virginia that every hiker should see. The first, which I saw today, was Dragon's Tooth. It was pretty cool, but I think it was a little misnamed. It should have been called Dragon's Teeth or Dragon's Mouth because there was several large rocks that looked like a tooth.
The hike up wasn't too bad, but the hike down got pretty sketchy in places. It was very rocky, very steep, and often times the trail was very narrow. There were spots where you had to walk along the rock face on another part of the rock that was less than the width of your shoe. And it was like a six or eight foot drop if you fell. I think this also had an effect on how tired I was by the end. After we finally got to the bottom, we still had about 8-9 miles left in our hike.
It's probably going to be worse tomorrow. Pacer and I are going to get up at around 3am and get on the trail by 4am so we can get up to McAfee Knob for sunrise. Then we'll hike another 16 miles into Daleville. McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs are the other two attractions of the triple crown, so we'll knock those out tomorrow. 
Tonight I'm staying at the Four Pines Hostel. It's a three bay car garage that has been converted into a bunkhouse. It's not terrible, but the layout isn't great. There are about 6 double bunks on one side, several couches scattered in the rest of the section, and a kitchen area. They don't do reservations. When I called the owner basically said if you show up, we'll find room for you. That's actually really awesome of them, but they can get crowded as a result and they only have a single bathroom with a shower. They have two privies that are outside up a slightly steep cliff. So all in all, it's not the best hostel I've stayed in, but it's still a bed and a warm shower so I'll take it.
Breakfast: The rest of a fruit tray and some chocolate milk.
Lunch: Cold leftover lasagna from yesterdays meal and some garlic bread. The lasagna was pretty good cold, but the bread was pretty soggy.
Recovery: Some chocolate milk from a gas station and a banana.
Dinner: The hostel makes dinner and today's meal was... drumroll... lasagna. So, I had lasagna for dinner yesterday, lunch today, and dinner today. Today's was good, but I liked the one we made yesterday better. Today's had mushrooms and some other things I'm not crazy about.

",VA-311/Four Pines Hostel,"May 31, Wed",13.80
Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664846,"So, I'm going to reevaluate the Four Pines Hostel somewhat from yesterday. On the positive, their shuttle driver did wake up at 3:30am so that he could get us to the trail by 4am so that we could see the sunrise at McAfee Knob. So, they are very accommodating. 
On the negative, they need to do a better job of enforcing their quiet hours. Since Pacer and I were going to start so early, we tried to get to bed a little early. Now, I obviously didn't expect people to keep the noise down prior to 10pm. But, I ended up waking up at about 10:15 to the lights still on and several loud conversations happening in the bunkhouse. It wasn't until about 10:45pm when someone finally came in and turned out the lights.
The other negative is that they don't have a clothes dryer for general use. They have a washer and then you're supposed to hang your clothes on a line to dry. There is a dryer in the main house that can get used if it's raining or late or whatever, but only the owner can use it and it was being used pretty heavily last night. So, we didn't get our laundry until about 9pm.
Finally, they allow pets, which I suppose is nice, but there were two dogs that decided to growl at each other for 15 minutes or so after the lights went out.
So with all these things combined, I ended up getting about 4 not so great hours of sleep. So, I was pretty tired for a good portion of the hike. Around 10 or 11am, I did finally start to ""wake up"", but now that the hike is over (we finished around 2:30pm), I'm exhausted. 
So, that was my experience with Four Pines. But, the risk we took in getting up early for the sunrise paid off in spades. I was worried the day before because it was overcast almost the entire day and I was afraid it would carry over into the morning. But it was absolutely gorgeous this morning and I think I got some amazing photos. The hike up there wasn't too bad either. I think because it's a very popular destination, the trail is very well maintained. But, it was mostly in the dark, so we still had to be careful.
The only other real tough section was up to Tinker Cliffs and even that wasn't too bad. So, I've now completed the Virginia triple crown.
I'm staying in Roanoke, VA tonight. Hopefully I can get some good sleep tonight because we may be doing another 20 miles tomorrow. It's still being decided.

I think 22 miles (or close to it anyway) may be the longest distance I've gone in a day. It started out fairly moderate, but at about the halfway point, there was quite a bit of uphill climbing. Nothing super difficult, just a lot of it. With about 5 or so miles left, it did start storming. At first it barely rained at all and seemed like it was going to miss us, but about 20 minutes later it started to rain pretty hard. Fortunately it only did it for about 30 minutes and it did lower the temperature quite a bit. We also had to pick up the pace towards the end because the road where we were getting picked up was going to be closing for an Iron Man race tomorrow. 
About the only points of interest worth mentioning are The Guillotine and some kind of weather radar. The Guillotine was actually pretty neat. It's a large rock that is wedged up between the underside of a crevice. You walk right under the rock. I just hope no one is there when gravity finally wins out against friction. 
I don't know anything about the weather radar other than it's a weather radar.
Pacer and I did hike with another thru-hiker named Jelly Bean today. We met her yesterday when she got picked up by the shuttle because she was also staying at the Fairfield Inn. Originally she was going to do the 20 miles today that Pacer and I did yesterday and then on Sunday do the 22 we did today. However, because of the Iron Man race on Sunday, the road that she would have had to get dropped off at is going to be closed. So she's doing that section with us today and will go back and do the previous 20 mile section tomorrow because her pickup point should be accessible by the time she finishes. 
Breakfast: Eggs, turkey sausage, oatmeal, and chocolate milk from the hotel breakfast. 
Snack: Some kind of Nature Valley bar and a banana.
Lunch: A Payday candy bar, some peanut butter crackers.
Trail Magic: We finally got some decent trail magic in Virginia. We were coming down to Jennings Creek and a group of people we just packing up because of the incoming storm. Fortunately they still had some things out, so we got some chips and Gatorade and a few other goodies.
Dinner: Ananas-Kaju-Malai Chicken, a Samosa, garlic Naan, and at Mt Dew.","Blue Ridge Parkway

So, Pacer went on ahead and I'm staying in the hotel for one more night. Fortunately at the time I'm writing this, I feel much better. Another night's rest and I should be good to get back on the trail.
I really didn't eat much all morning. I tried to eat breakfast but it just came back up a short while later. So, I pretty much spent all morning sleeping. By the afternoon I was starting to feel better, but didn't want to eat anything to heavy so I thought I'd Doordash some food. That's how I ended up with a 36 count variety box of Motts applesauce, a 28 count box of Gatorade, and one very large container of Chobani vanilla Greek yogurt. I didn't realize it at the time I ordered everything, but I got it all from a wholesale store instead of a regular grocery store.","

I'm glad for it too because it still took a lot out of me. I'm still feeling some of the after effects of being sick. My sides hurt and I was definitely feeling a little worn out most of the hike. Hopefully a good meal and another night's rest will bring me back up to top shape. 
Tonight I'm staying at Stanimals hostel is Glasgow, VA. It's a pretty small house, but also kind of nice. I definitely need to get some food in me though.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665122,"Today was quite a bit tougher than yesterday. It started out pretty easy, lots of flat walks. So much so that at one point I think I was close to averaging 4 miles/hour. But several miles in is when the uphill climbing started which put a stop to that pretty quick.
I was originally going to stay at Stanimals again tonight, but my hiking partner for today, Jelly Bean, is staying at a Hampton Inn in Lexington, VA.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665169,"So, 25 miles...
All in all, it wasn't terrible. It was long. I'm tired. I wouldn't want to do it often, but it's good to know that under the right circumstances, I can do it in a reasonable time if I needed to.
The only real tough section was right at the beginning. It was about 2000' up in a little under 3 miles. After that, it was mostly just a few rolling hills, quite a bit of flat areas, and two moderate couple hundred foot climbs. Those did come towards the end though, so even moderate climbs are tough after already walking 18 miles. It ended with a 3000' decent over about 4.5 miles. Maybe I was just determined to get the hike over with, but I actually got a nice burst of energy and ended up jogging down the mountain for probably 2 or 3 miles I'd say. We started the hike at about 7am and I got to the parking lot at about 5:45pm. 25 miles in under 11 hours is pretty good to me.
Breakfast: Two pre-made small western style omelets, an orange, a banana, an apple danish, a sausage patty, two glasses of orange juice, and two glasses of strawberry-kiwi water from the hotel breakfast. 
Snack 1: A double chocolate chip muffin
Lunch: Two peanut butter and jelly bagel sandwiches. 
Snack 2: Two really broken frosted Pop-Tarts. I think they were strawberry, but not sure. My hiking partner Jelly Bean gave them to me last night.
Recovery Drink: A quart of chocolate milk that our shuttle driver Michael was awesome enough to pick up for me on his way to the pickup point
Dinner: Penne pasta with Alfredo sauce, spinach, and blackened chicken. And a coke.","US-60

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665251,"So today started with correcting a screw up on my part from yesterday. Since I basically ran the last few miles, I got to the shuttle pickup point about 20 minutes ahead of Jelly Bean and right when the shuttle driver arrived.  I decided to do some stretching, so I stuck my hiking poles in the ground next to a tree.
Well, 20 minutes later, we left with my poles still stuck in the ground under the tree. I didn't realize I'd forgotten them until we were already back at the hotel.
Fortunately it was only about a 20 minute detour this morning to swing by there. And they were right were I had left them the day before. So, we got started a little bit later than I intended, but not by much. And the drive ended up being fairly interesting because it required going along some of the back roads of Virginia.
Just a side note. I felt a little like a minor celebrity this morning at breakfast. A few people found out Jelly Bean and I were thru-hikers and couldn't stop asking us questions about it. I thought one guy was on the verge of asking for my autograph. It was entertaining, but a little surreal. 
The 15 mile hike itself was good, but I'm glad it was only 15 because my legs were still a little fatigued from the 25 yesterday. I'm also glad that we slackpacked SOBO (southbound, as opposed to NOBO or northbound) because if we had come the other way, there was a 6 mile, 3000 foot elevation change that was bad enough going down. I saw a few people near the top coming up and they all looked pretty spent. Not only was it a long climb, but there were sections that were very rocky as well.
There was a point about 6 miles in where we could have taken a blue blaze trail that would have cut our total milage from about 15 to around 11. It was called the Mau-Har trail. It's supposedly still pretty tough but many of the FarOut comments said it was worth doing because of the springs along the trail. We did entertain the idea, but ultimately decided to stick to the white blazes.
Breakfast: An egg white frittata, which was basically the same thing as the western omelet from yesterday.  Some smoked sausages, an apple danish, two glasses of orange juice and two glasses of strawberry-kiwi water from the hotel.
Snack: A bag of cheesy gold fish
Lunch: A peanut butter, banana, and honey bagel.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665253,"Yesterday Pacer wasn't feeling well, so she took a zero at Stanimals in Waynesboro. Since she was only about a day ahead, that allowed Jelly Bean and I to catch back up with her. So, we all hiked together today.
The hike itself, at least for Pacer and I was very easy. We only did about 14 miles and there weren't any real big climbs. We started at about 7am and were done before 1pm. We did see a pretty large black snake on the trail, but it slithered into the grass before I could get a picture. 
Unfortunately this will be the last day, at least for the foreseeable future, that I'll be hiking with Jelly Bean. While Pacer and I only did 14 miles, JB did about 19. She is trying to get as far as she can before next Friday because she has to get off trail for a few days for a wedding.
Pacer and I stopped when we did because tomorrow we are also sort of getting off trail as well. Tomorrow we are going to start our aqua-blaze adventure. Instead of hiking the normal AT, we are ""buying"" a used canoe and we are going to canoe down the Shenandoah River. We're going to start with three days to see how we like it. If it's fun, then we plan on going all the way to Harper's Ferry in West Virginia. We are kind of winging the whole thing, but basically we'll go a certain distance each day, hopefully get to an established camp site, spend the night in our tents, and do the same thing the next day. If there are no established sites, then I've read that there are places one can stealth camp if needed.
Earlier I said we are buying a canoe, and technically that is true. As of tomorrow I will officially own a canoe. However, once we are finished, the place we bought it from will buy it back, for a reduced price of course, so once we're done aqua-blazing, I don't have to worry about what I'm now supposed to do with a boat.
I admit I'm both excited and a little nervous. Right now there are quite a few unknowns and that makes me slightly uncomfortable, but the thought of getting off my feet for even a few days is very enticing. It'll be nice to use a different set of muscles for a bit. Plus, just the change itself I think will be refreshing. It's sort of like how I felt at the very beginning of this thru-hike. It's new, so there's the novelty of it that makes it exciting.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665363,"Aqua-blaze day one was a success. We started a little bit later than the 8am time we were supposed to because the canoes were a little late to arrive. I think it was around 8:30-8:45 before we actually got in the water and got going.
It was definitely fun, but there were also some pretty frustrating parts. Since it hasn't rained a lot, the river water level is pretty low. This led to a lot of areas where our canoe got caught on rocks and we either had to push ourselves out with our paddles, or one of us had to actually get out of the canoe and push or pull it as needed.
There were also just a lot of instances where we would get up to a decent pace only to run over a rock and not stop, but completely kill the boats forward momentum. 
There was also a section with a relatively swift rapid (for being in a canoe, nothing that would equal something on a white water rafting trip) where a kayak in front ofnus got stuck. The channel the water flowed through was very narrow and there was a good chance that we'd hit him if we tried going past him. Fortunately our canoe kind of got stuck on a different rock. So, we just sat for about 15 minutes or so hoping he'd get his kayak unstuck. He did not. Some of the other guys he was kayaking with attempted to help, but eventually we couldn't wait any longer and just had to hope we wouldn't hit anyone when we went through the rapid. 
We got to today's final destination at the Shenandoah River Park at about 5:30pm. We are going to have our canoe transfered around a dam and we'll continue down the river tomorrow morning. Tonight we are going to tent at the Shenandoah River Adventure HQ, which is where we got the canoe from.
Breakfast: Two small cartons of chocolate milk, a apple muffin, a small sugar waffle, and two glasses of orange juice. 
Snack: A clementine orange
Lunch: Since we were in a canoe, when we were ready for lunch we found a small landing area, pulled off, and had lunch at what turned out to be a potential campsite for canoeers. I had half a italian sub and some harvest cheddar Sun Chips.

",Shenandoah River Park,"Jun 10, Sat",23
Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665364,"Our starting point today was just on the other side of dam near the Shenandoah River Park which was just a few feet from where we camped for the night.
It's been a while since I had to tent camp on the trail. It was pleasant for the most part. The only issue that I had was that in the evening it was hot enough that I woke up sweating quite a bit in my quilt so I got out of it, but by early morning the temperature had dropped enough that I woke up again because I was cold.
I also woke up because of some kind of noise that I can only describe as a train being loaded with something. It happened a few times in the very early morning, but then stopped. I have no idea what it actually was.
Today's canoe trip was pretty similar to yesterday. There were several sections that we had to get out because of low water and our boat getting stuck. It's supposed to rain tonight and into tomorrow, so hopefully that helps out somewhat with the water level. The only real difference today was that we did come to a dam that we had to self portage around. And it sucked.
We ended up having to drag the canoe about 300 yards, partly uphill, to get around the dam. That's after getting the heavier stuff out of the canoe and walking it to where we'd get back in the water. I think total I walked the path 3 times, once dragging the canoe.
The other thing that I noticed today that I didn't yesterday was that there was a pretty long section before the dam where it almost felt like we were paddling upriver. Maybe it was just a mind trick, but it just felt like I had to put in twice the effort to go half the speed.
But, we still ended up getting to our port spot by 5:30pm. Tonight I'm staying at the Quality Inn in Luray, VA. Pacer and I had to walk through their historic downtown to get to the laundromat and it's a pretty nice looking town, at least the little part I saw.
Depending on how the weather plays out, tomorrow might be a short day. The forecast is showing thunderstorms and/or rain showers until about 2pm. We definitely won't go canoeing if it's thunderstorming, but even the rain might pose an issue because the temperature is supposed to drop. It might not be a good idea to be on the water if it's raining and it gets to cold. We're going to wait until morning and decide what to do.
Breakfast: A bagel with honey pecan cream cheese.
Lunch: Mini ham and cheese sandwiches on kings hawaiian buns and harvest cheddar Sun Chips.
Snacks: I had a bag of Starburst jellybeans for a while that I was snacking on while paddling, but they ended up getting a bunch of water in the bag and got ruined. I also had a couple clementines and some crackers with fake cheese in a can.
Dinner: A bacon gouda chicken sandwich, with fries and two glasses of lemonade at Watch & Warrent in Luray. It was decent, but the chicken was a little rubbery.
Dessert: A maple bacon cinnamon roll. This was delicious, but also huge. I only ate half and will have the other half for breakfast.","Shenandoah River Adventure HQ

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665604,"Since we don't have detailed maps for much of the Shenandoah River, it's difficult to give a precise distance traveled sometimes.
We didn't start on the water today until close to 2:30pm or so. We decided that since the forecast was calling for rain starting yesterday night and possibly into the morning, that we would just take a half day and hopefully wait it out. We also hoped that it would rain enough to raise the water level a little bit. Unfortunately none of those things happened. It did rain, but it didn't start until about noon and it wasn't really all that much. It was nice to have the morning to just relax, but I would have rather had the time to get some extra miles in instead. Or, if we were going to do a half day, I'd rather have it after putting in some work rather than before.
But we still made the most of it. We got some breakfast, lounged around for a little while, got some lunch, then got on the water. We were supposed to get picked up at the hotel by the company that was holding onto our canoe by 1:30pm, but he was running late and it was closer to 2pm before he showed up. I think he was waiting for some other canoers or kayaker at one of the pick up points, but they didn't show up when they said they would. 
On the upside though, we're pretty sure that he dropped us off about 5 miles past where we thought we were going to start. This saved us from having to do a self portage (which is taking the canoe out of the water and moving it over land around whatever is blocking your forward progress) around a hydro dam, which we were told was pretty difficult. 
The canoeing itself was more of the same, though there did seem to be a lot more shallow sections than previously. I think towards the end of the day, it was starting to get to both Pacer and I because there was definitely some misdirected frustrations on both our parts I think. It just gets to be irritating when you have to constantly either get out of the boat because your stuck on some rocks or even just maneuver back and forth across the river because it's the only path available.
Finally around 6:30pm, we'd decided we had had enough for the day so we found a spot along the river where we could setup camp. It is actually a pretty decent campsite. It has a fire ring already, so I just found a big tree branch, dragged it over by the ring, and we had ourselves a nice place to sit. We got a fire going, had some dinner, and got to just relax and unwind for a little bit before bedtime. So, overall I think it was a good day in spite of, or perhaps even because of some of the challenges we faced today.
Breakfast: French toast with strawberries and whipped cream, two sausage patties, a glass of orange juice and a glass of chocolate milk from Alexander's, which is the breakfast restaurant attached to the hotel we stayed at.
Lunch: Chicken Alfredo with broccoli from an Italian restaurant next to the hotel.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665605,"Today started out good, but ended not so great. It was probably about 7am when I got out of my tent. I got the fire from the previous night going again and had a bagel with cream cheese for breakfast. Pacer got up shortly after and after she ate, we got packed up and got on the water around 8:30am or so.
The first half or so of the trip went pretty smoothly. There were still some shallow areas, but it wasn't too bad. I think we only had to get out of the boat once. The second half though was a nightmare. It felt like we were getting out because we got stuck every 500 feet. I think at one point it took us almost an hour to go less than a mile. By about 6:30, we had had enough for the day and started looking for a place to camp
One of the challenging things about aqua-blazing is that there isn't a lot of information about the river. It's not like the AT trail where there are guidebooks and phone apps that give you detailed information about places to stay, miles between locations, etc. A lot of what we do while canoeing down the river is just winging it. Though I will say that for this section, we did have a somewhat decent map that I downlloaded from one of the river adventure businesses. There were also mile markers that matched the map, so we at least had a pretty good idea of where we were on the river. 
Anyway, we'd pull up to an island or a spot along the bank, determine whether it would make a good camping spot, and move on if it didn't work for us. After checking a few spots, we finally managed to find a decent one at about 7pm. It wasn't as good as the one yesterday. It was smaller, didn't have a fire ring, and it was a lot muddier around the banks, but we decided it was good enough and we're staying here for the night.
Despite the afternoons frustrations, overall I think it was a solid day. There were also three notable events that happened.
First, Pacer and I almost killed a kid in the river (a little over dramatic, but not by much). All along the river, there are spots where it flows over ledges. Nothing big, maybe six to eight inches at most. But, big enough that there are blind spots, especially with the water churning over them. Anyway, I'm in the bow of the canoe and Pacer is at the stern. We start going over one of these ledges when all of a sudden I see a leg, and just a leg, sticking out of the water in front of us. Without even thinking, I yell stop, as if that was even a remote possibility, slam my paddle into the water and we managed to get the canoe turned in time to avoid the leg and float past. Keep in mind that all of this happened within a span of about 5 seconds. When we get past the leg, we look back and there is this kid laying at the bottom of this little ledge face down in the water. For a split second we thought he might be dead, but then he lifted his head out of the water and looked at us. I don't think he was even aware of what just happened, though there was a group of his friends nearby that saw the whole thing and started laughing.
The second notable event was that we saw a bunch of cows in the river along the bank. I think there were probably 8-10 of them just walking in the water along the edge. They were also pretty loud. They didn't seem amused when I tried to speak to them in their own language though.
Finally, at camp, after we had gotten all setup, Pacer was sitting by the canoe when she noticed some pretty significant splashing a fair ways down the river. At first we thought it might be fish, or perhaps an animal dying or something like that. So I just kind of ignored it, but then Pacer noticed that it was getting closer. As we watched it, she asked out loud ""is that a person?"" Sure enough, a few seconds later it was close enough to determine that it was unmistakenly a person swimming up the river. Keep in mind that by this time it was probably about 8pm. It probably shouldn't have been such a surprise, but at the time it just seemed like an absurd occurrence. I joked that he was going to swim to our little island, tell us we couldn't camp there (there is private property all along the river), then immediately turn around and swim back to where he came from. But instead, he swam a little ways past, turned around, and swam back down the river. Pacer thinks he or she could have been training for a triathlon or something like that.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665606,"Today was pretty much the reverse of yesterday. It started out with a lot of shallow water, hitting rocks, and cursing. It took us about 3 hours to go just under 6 miles.
We ported at the Front Royal public boat landing near Eastham Park. The plan was to go into town, get some lunch, resupply, and figure out our next steps. After Front Royal, we had even less information about the river than before.
After doing some research, we found out that there was a hostel near a boat landing that was about 12 miles up river. We wanted to get off the river for a night so we could shower, do laundry, have a decent meal, and sleep in a decent bed. We figured the latest we'd get to the landing was about 7pm. So we called them, told them we were coming by river, and they said as long as we could get there by 7 that they'd come pick us up.
Unfortunately it took us longer to get back to the boat than we would have liked. Getting into town we were able to find an Uber driver, but we were not able to find one to get back to the boat. It was only about a mile or so, but we wasted time trying to get a ride, then another 20 minutes walking. So, it was about 1pm by the time we started paddling again.
But after about a mile or so, the river started to change for the better and we crushed the 12 miles in about 4 hours and that was with a 30+ minute self portage around a dam. There were actually parts of the river just before the dam that was deep enough for fairly large motor boats to cruise through. We got to the Morgan Ford public landing at about 5:30pm.
Speaking of the dam we had to portage around. It ended up being a hilarious (for one of us anyways) pain in the ass. The problem was that the area where we had to pull the canoe out was a complete muddy mess. I stepped out and immediately sank all the way to my knees. And it wasn't light fluffy mud, it was thick suctiony mud that wanted to eat my crocs. No matter how hard I tried to pull my leg, I just couldn't get them out without losing my shoes. Eventually I had to just pull my legs out without my shoes on and I reached my hand down in the hole to pull them out. But, when I tried to pull the first one out, it was so hard that I broke the heel strap on one of them. Eventually I was able to get them both out. So at this point I have two legs, one arm, and two shoes covered in mud and I hadn't even made it to the actual shore yet and Pacer is laughing her ass off the whole time. Oh, and the mud absolutely reeked. It smelled like raw sewage. Eventually I was able get onto soild ground and because I'm such a great guy, I pulled the canoe up far enough so she didn't also have to play in the mud.
Once we got the canoe onto land, the portage was tough but not terrible. It was made a little more difficult because I had to do it barefoot since I couldn't get any traction in my muddy shoes.
The rest of the trip was a breeze and now we are at The Stumble Inn hostel. I've gotten a shower, my clothes are currently getting clean, I've eaten a decent meal, and I've got a nice bed waiting for me. Overall it's been a good day.
Breakfast: A bagel with honey pecan cream cheese 
Lunch: A double BBQ bacon cheeseburger, fries, and a strawberry pineapple formation (their version of a DQ blizzard) at Spelunker's Frozen Custard & Cavern Burger. It was very good. The burger seemed like actual ground meat instead of a solid meat patty like a lot of fast food burgers.
Dinner: Orange chicken with fried rice and an egg roll from Old Place Asian Kitchen. It was decent I guess. The fried rice was pretty basic and the orange chicken didn't have much flavor.

I don't know the exact mileage, but based off a map I was able to get a few days ago, I think we did at least 26 miles. This means we only have about 16 miles left to Harper's Ferry and the end of our aqua-blaze adventure.
Not to brag, but after five straight days of canoeing, Pacer and I have gotten pretty good at reading the river and being able to follow the flow of it through the shallow areas without getting caught on rocks. I think we only had to get out twice. We still got stuck a few times, but we were always able to just use our paddles to push us in a different direction without having to actually get out.
Our campsite tonight is also probably the best one yet. It's fairly large, has a firering, plenty of wood laying around, and some decent tent spots. We're going to cook up the rest of our food tonight, get some rest, and hopefully we'll be in Harper's Ferry tomorrow pretty early

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665608,"Today was a great day that was made less great because of piss poor planning by the company we bought the canoe from.
After looking at a map last night, I realized that instead of 16 miles we actually only had 12 miles to go. So that made the start of the day even better, because it was a realistic possibility that we could be done by noon.
So, we were on the water by 8am. The river was mostly cooperative, the only thing that was terrible was that it started to rain at about 9am and came down pretty hard for close to 2 hours. It was relatively warm out though, so I wasn't too uncomfortable even though I was soaking wet. And we once again made awesome time. We got to Moulton Park, which is where we were supposed to meet the canoe company so we could return it to them, at around 11:30am. So we did about 12 miles in under 4 hours.
And this is where the day fell apart. We gave the company a 24 hour notice of when we would arrive at the pickup spot, like they asked us to. We then told them today when we were about 2 hours out (again, like they asked us to). Despite all this advanced notice, it took the guy over four hours after we docked to finally show up. Multiple times he texted about how close he was. He sent one text that just said he was getting closer. My immediate response wanted to be, well I sure as hell hope you aren't getting farther. He then texted about how he was 15 miles away. Then an hour later he texted that he was 10 minutes away tops, then we waited another 30 minutes and just to add insult to injury, at this time it started raining again. It had been perfectly sunny the entire four hours we had been waiting. He finally pulled up at about 4pm in a junk pickup truck, so we had to put all our stuff in the back... where it would still get wet from the rain, and he drove use to the hotel where we are staying tonight. While I won't go so far as saying that half a day was wasted, because we did get to relax in the sun while we waited, it was definitely hours that I would rather have spent doing something else.
I did get some good news though. When I originally booked the hotel room, they only had availability for one night. Well, Pacer has some family coming to visit her tomorrow, so she we are taking a zero day. So, we were going to have to figure out where to stay tomorrow night. Well, I had put my name on a waiting list in case there was a last minute cancelation. About 2 hours after checking in, the receptionist called and said someone did cancel because of a Covid event. So, we now have the room booked for two nights like we originally wanted.
Thus ends our aqua-blaze adventure. Overall I had a blast and I'm really glad we did it. It was not as leisurely as I was hoping and there were definitely extremely frustrating moments, but it was such a nice change of pace from hiking. My legs got to have a nice rest. I saw all kinds of wildlife. Herons, ducks, fish, egrets. We even saw a bald eagle today while it was raining which was cool. We also officially crossed the 1000 mile mark yesterday and made our own marker out of river rocks to celebrate. We also finished the state of Virginia first thing this morning when we crossed into West Virginia. Next up is a short jaunt through Maryland and then it's onto Pennsylvania. 
Bteakfast: I didn't eat anything in camp. Instead I ate another bag of turtle Chex mix while in the canoe.
Lunch: We didn't really get to have lunch because we were waiting for the canoe guy all afternoon. I did eat a couple of clementines. 
Dinner. We went to The Anvil in Harper's Ferry for dinner. It's named after a play of the same name which is about the trial of John Brown. John Brown was an abolitionist who orchestrated a raid on an armory in Harper's Ferry prior to the Civil War. He wanted to start a slave revolt, but failed. He was tried and executed for treason.
We ordered the Bruksel Lahanasi as an appetizer. It's flash-fried brussel sprouts mixed with walnuts, currants, capers, and a honey-vinaigrette. I got a full rack of ribs with green beans and french fries, Pacer got seared scallops in a white sauce. I gave her half of my ribs and she gave me half of her scallops. Everything was excellent.
Dessert: Pacer and I went half and half on some banana pudding and a chocolate lava cake. It was good, but I've had better banana pudding.","Riverside Campsite

While she did that, I walked around Harper's Ferry. It's a small town, but there's a lot of history here. Mostly involving the period around the Civil War.
I saw the area where John Brown raided an armory in an attempt to start a slave revolt. It failed and he was tried and executed for treason.
I also went into what used to be Storer College, which was setup after the Civil War to help educate former slaves.
Overall I only took me a few hours to see most everything. So, the rest of the day I spent in the hotel relaxing.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665723,"Today was the first day back on the trail in over a week. All in all it was a pretty easy hike, but I could definitely tell that my legs are going to need a few days to readjust to being used so much again.
Not really much else to the hike today. We did pass by a monument to George Washington which was pretty nice. It was a stone tower, probably about 25 or 30 feet high, that had steps that took you to the top. It had a nice view of the surrounding area, which I think included the town of Boonsboro, MD. It was built in 1827, 60 years before the one in D.C.
Though this happened yesterday, I'm now officially out of Virginia and today we are officially done with West Virginia (not a big accomplishment, I think the trail only runs through WV for like 4 miles in this section).
Breakfast: A biscuit with gravy, an apple danish, a bowl of fruit loops, and a strawberry banana yogurt.
Snack: Two smores Pop-Tarts. 
Lunch: Yesterday Pacer bought a loaf of country bread and a variety pack of spreadable Fromage Blanc cheese. So we had that for lunch. The cheeses were plain, maple, garlic and herb, and honey sriracha. I also had an apple and some fresh picked black raspberries from the trail.
Dinner: Four cheese mac and cheese with honey pepper chicken, a mango lemonade, and a triple chocolate meltdown from Applebee's.","I-70 Parking Lot

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665770,"Today was really hard.
I think it was a combination of several things. It was hot. I think the temperature was in the high 80s to low 90s. It also seemed pretty humid because it didn't take much to start sweating a lot. I also think my legs are still not fully adjusted to being used so much again. But, I think the most significant factor for why today was so difficult was because it felt like 80% of the trail was nothing but rocks.
The trail actually started out fairly good, but a few miles in and all of a sudden it felt like all we were doing was stepping on more rocks. I may have said this in another entry, but trying to hike on rocks sucks for a lot of reasons. One, rocks are hard. There is no give when you plant your feet on them, so after a few hours it's like the bottoms of your feet have been hit with a meat tenderizer. Two, many of the rocks are in the ground at odd angles. So, instead of stepping on one of the flat sides, you end up stepping on an edge that's facing up. And three, trying to hike over a trail of rocks is much slower than hiking a nice dirt path. More thought has to be given as to where to step so you don't twist or break an ankle. The path over the rocks might also not be in a straight line, so more thought has to be given about where to step. All of these factors together make forward progress much slower.
By the end of the hike, both Pacer and I were pretty spent. But, we did get a little pick me up. Earlier Pacer had said she would pay $20 for a cold Gatorade. Well, with about 3 miles left in our hike we came to Pen Mar Park. FarOut mentioned vending machines in the area, but we didn't know where and it was a pretty big park. We had a shuttle scheduled, so we didn't want to waste a lot of time searching, or walk the extra distance since we were already tired. But we decided to give it a shot and then we spotted a big o' sign at one of the park pavilions that said ""trail magic."" It was just what we needed at just the right time.
A woman named Patchouli was having her birthday and she had setup a pretty nice trail magic station to celebrate. There was pulled pork, hot dogs, macaroni salad, and cold drinks, including cold Gatorade. And Pacer didn't even have to pay $20 for it.
We also crossed the Mason-Dixon line towards the end of our hike. So, we are officially out of Maryland and into Pennsylvania. I think Pennsylvania has the second largest section of the AT after Virginia, so we'll be here for a while.
Breakfast: A biscuit with gravy, strawberry banana yogurt, a bowl of fruit loops and a glass of orange juice.

We were going to hike 16 miles to the Pine Grove Furnace General Store, meet my parents, and niece, then do the half gallon ice cream challenge. Since it's just past the half way point, the goal is to eat a half gallon of ice cream in a single sitting.
Unfortunately, Pacer is having some kind of issue with her foot. She has a blister on her heel and it's difficult for her to walk on it, so we just got a shuttle to the hotel, we are taking a zero today and tomorrow and we are going to give her heel time to heal.
The morning was spent just laying around. We were a little worried that because we arrived at the hotel so early, we wouldn't be able to check in, but we were able to get it squared away and got to our room at around 9:30am.
At around 3pm, I got a call from my Mom saying they were about 30 minutes away from the hotel. About 2 minutes later, someone knocks on our room door. Neither Pacer nor I were expecting anyone, so we were both a little confused. I opened the door and then got one of the best hugs I've ever gotten. Instead of being 30 minutes away, my family was already there and my niece gave me a great big hug as soon as I opened the door. It was a great surprise. 
The rest of the afternoon was spent catching up and also playing a game of Sorry. Avery really took to Pacer and the two of them got along great. We went to dinner and then Avery, Pacer, and I had a dance party in their room. It was a great way to end a really great day.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665975,"The big event for today was a trip to Hersheypark in Hershey, PA. We were very limited in what we were able to do because it was rainy and slightly chilly (for June). We didn't actually even go into the amusement park area at all, which was a shame. When we first talked about going a few days ago, we were going to go to the waterpark, which would have been really nice.
But, we were still able to have a good time. We did a tour that explained how they make their chocolate at the factory. It was fine for what it was I guess.
The other big thing we did was get a giant Reece cup stuffed with our own chosen ingredients. And when I say giant, I'm talking about a Reese cup that is about 7"" in diameter. The thing was massive. Avery got white chocolate chips, crushed cookies, crushed Reese's pieces, and sprinkles with a caramel sauce topping. I got chopped peanuts, white chocolate chips, and two scoops of crushed cookies. I also topped it off with some caramel sauce.
We also did lunch and then did some souvenir shopping.
When we got back to the hotel, we played some Uno, got dinner, and Avery got to go swimming in the pool for a little while.
Breakfast: French toast with strawberries and whipped cream.
Lunch: A 10 inch pepperoni pizza and a strawberry lemonade at the Hershey food court. It was about what you'd expect a amusement park food court pizza to taste like.

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666008,"Let's talk about today's main event first, then I'll talk about the hike.
Today, at the end of our hike, Pacer and I both competed in the Pine Grove Furnace half gallon ice cream challenge. Since they no longer make half gallon containers of Hershey ice cream, we instead had to eat a larger container (less than a half gallon though) plus a smaller pint sized container. We are allowed to choose different flavors for each container. 
My ice cream of choice was banana pudding for the larger one and dulce de leche for the smaller one. Pacer chose chocolate for her larger container and raspberry chocolate chip for the small size.
My strategy was to eat it like any other normal serving of ice cream. I started with the banana pudding and while I was eating, I just casually read the news on my phone. Spoonful by spoonful, I slowly whittled my way through that tub of fat and sugar till I had eaten every last available bite. With the banana pudding finished, I moved to the dulce de leche. The biggest obstacle to finishing at this point wasn't that I was full, though I was starting to get there fast. No, the biggest problem was that I was freezing. It wasn't a real hot day to begin with, maybe in the low 70s or high 60s, and eating that much ice cream dropped my body temperature enough that I was shivering uncontrollably like it was below freezing. But I was determined, so I took a deep breath and started in on the pint. 35 minutes and about 2000 calories later, I emerged from the half gallon challenge victorious. Pacer finished up hers about 10 minutes later. So, we both went and signed the victory book and claimed our well deserved trophy, which was a small 3 inch wooden spoon. 
It was a bittersweet victory though. Like all vacations, they are over way too fast and this morning I had to say goodbye to my family. They took Pacer and I to the trailhead, we did our hugs and said our goodbyes and off we walked into the woods. If all goes well, it'll be about three months before I see any of them again. But, the next time I do see them, my Appalachian Trail journey will be over.
Breakfast: Oatmeal and a hashbrown from McDonald's. 
Lunch: 1.5 quarts of banana pudding ice cream and 1 pint of dulce de leche ice cream. 
First Dinner: Yes, even after eating all that ice cream, I was hungry again several hours later. I had Avery's left over spaghetti and meatballs from when we ate at the University Grille.
Second Dinner: A 6 inch ham and turkey sandwich from Subway. Thus was going to be our lunch, but we decided to skip lunch since we were going to eat ice cream.","5-Way Gravel Road Intersection
",Pine Grove Furnace General Store/ Courtyard,"Jun 23, Fri",15.80
Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666019,"It was an unnecessarily long day today.
Our original plan was to hike about 19 miles into Boiling Springs and then get shuttled to the Quality Inn in nearby Carlisle. But, we told the driver that there was a good chance that we would go further depending on how we felt. In the same shuttle was Jelly Bean. She was also staying at the Courtyard, but she was about a days hike in front of us, so she was getting dropped off further ahead. He said to just give him about an hour heads up so that he could be there on time.
Well, a couple of miles from Boiling Springs, we did decide to go a few more miles. About 3 more to be exact. So, we called the guy and let him know. He sounded a little flabbergasted when I talked to him, but seemed to indicate that he'd be there.
When we get to Boiling Springs, after a brief pit stop at the local gas station for a Gatorade, we run into the shuttle driver. He said he couldn't pick us up because he had to pick up Jelly Bean from further away and he wouldn't be able to get to us in time. Fortunately he was able to call another shuttle driver who was able to meet us and we finished our hike at about 5:30pm.
The days delay came when we got to the hotel. There was only a single person working and there were about 6 people waiting in front of us to get checked in. It ended up taking probably about 30 minutes to get our room key.
We did get invited to dinner by a gentleman in front of us though. He is from Indianapolis, but was there for some kind of tractor conference I think. Anyway, he's in his 70s and he plans on hiking the trail with his 50ish year old daughter in 2026. So, as a form of trail magic he offered to buy us dinner at the nearby Middlesex Diner. It was Pacer, me, and two other thru-hikers. 
It was a nice gesture that we couldn't turn down, but by the time we finished it was almost 8:30pm. So, we didn't get to do laundry and we still had to arrange a shuttle for tomorrow. It made for a bit of a hectic time right before going to sleep. 
Breakfast: An overpriced cup of yogurt with granola, some fruit, and a packet of honey that I bought from the Courtyard restaurant.

I think the total elevation change was maybe a few hundred feet, so it was basically flat the entire time. Several times we went through farmer's fields. The only real negative was that as the day wore on, it did start to get pretty hot and humid.
But by the end it was a completely different story. The climbing wasn't too bad, though the heat and humidity didnt help, but the rocks, ugh... they are the worst. And to top it all off, it started raining pretty heavily. Though I will say, it is so much better hiking in the rain when it's in the 70s as opposed to when it's in the 40s. If it hadn't gone on for so long, I would even say I welcomed it because it dropped the temperature and humidity to a reasonable level.
I also dropped my phone on a rock and now I have a crack in my screen which sucks.
But, I was able to do 22 miles and get to the hostel by 4pm, so overall I'm pretty happy with today's hike.

I was originally going to do about 16 miles, but I got started late and I also kept hearing about a massive thunderstorm coming in, so I decided it would be best to cut my hike short, so I wouldn't get caught in it.
I can say it didn't end up storming in Duncannon, but that doesn't mean it didn't storm up in the mountains. Either way, I was happy for the short day. The hike out of town was nice. It was maybe a mile and a half of walking on roads and over bridges along the freeway. So nice and flat.
But the climb up really sucked. It wasn't that it was too difficult. It's just that the humidity is so high right now that it drains my energy pretty quick. It also didn't help that it was pretty rocky for the entire climb and lasted a couple of miles. They were mostly big rocks that you could step on, instead of the small angled rocks that tear up your feet, but still a pain when there's hundreds of them.
After the climb though, it did get a little better. There were some spots that were rocky, but other spots were dirt and pine needles which is always nice.

The interior of a medical ward. All around people are in medical beds. Across the room, a set of double swinging doors opens. A nurse walks through, followed by Argonaut and Pacer.
Nurse: We're doing the best we can with what we got, but we can't perform miracles.
The nurse stops next to a bed with a patient who is laying awake. She points to the patients feet.
Nurse: Plantar fasciitis. It'll need to be amputated. 
The patients head snaps up to the nurse.
Patient: Wait, what?!
Before the patient can utter another word, the nurse grabs a meat cleaver from a nearby tray and with one swing severs the patients foot from his ankle. The patient screams as blood shoots everywhere. The nurse puts the bloody cleaver back on the tray and walks away. Argonaut and Pacer follow.
Nurse: Such a shame to see something like that happen to one so young.
Pacer: This is all the ATC's doing.
Argonaut: (rolls eyes) Not this again.
Pacer: Don't roll your eyes at me. This is just like the ""water."" I was right about that and I'm right about this too.
Argonaut: (mock indignation) You always have to bring that up. I told you, my glasses were dirty!
A man in a military uniform walks into the medical ward and approaches our two heroes.
Military Man: The Colonel is ready to see you. Please follow me.
Nurse: Good luck to the both of you. The feet of the nation depends on your success. 
The nurse turns and walks away. Argonaut and Pacer follow the military man down some halls and into a small briefing room. Our heros sit in some front row chairs.
Behind the podium stands the Colonel. Behind him is a large projection screen.
The Colonel: ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!! I have had it with these motherf***ing rocks on this motherf***ing trail!!
The Colonel presses a button on the podium and an old dark grainy picture of a sinister looking Virginian appears on the projector screen. He's looking at the camera with yellow eyes and in the process of pouring a bucket of rocks on the ground.
The Colonel: Thirty years ago, those damn Virginian volunteers started bringing their rocks up to Pennsylvania and dumping them on the trail. They knew that Virginia rocks and Pennsylvania soil don't react well together. Now every year the rocks multiply and grow bigger and if it isn't stopped, there will be dire consequences. 
You two are to go out on the trail, find rock zero, and put an end to all this cobblestone nonsense. Any questions? 
Before any other word can be spoken, a uniformed woman walks in and hands a report to The Colonel. He thumbs through it quickly then angrily looks at the uniformed woman.
The Colonel: Is this for real?
Uniformed Woman: Its been confirmed twice sir.
The Colonel: God damnit!!
The Colonel turns back to our heroes.
The Colonel: The ATC has been playing us all along. We just received word that they have been purposefully rerouting the trail to go through as many rocks as possible for years. 
Pacer immediately looks at Argonaut with gloating satisfaction. Argonaut covers his face with his hand. Pacer looks back at The Colonel. 
Pacer: Colonel, we're just a couple of hikers. We're not qualified for this.
The Colonel: That's not what my file says. You became canoe experts in a week. You've been thru-hiking for months. You're as qualified as anyone we've got. Hikers feets will never be safe if this menace isn't stopped. We need you, no the country needs you to do this.

Dessert: I forget what they were called, but it was three small cream puff shells filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with chocolate sauce and almonds. It was good, but not as good as I was expecting.","Reservoir Rd

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666479,"Well today ended up being a bust.
Last night I called a shuttle driver and he said he'd be able to pick us up at 8:00am, drop our packs off at the hotel in Delaware Water Gap, then drop us off at Wind Gap. It was a red flag when he told me to call him at 7:15am to make sure he was awake, but we didn't really have any other options.
Well, morning came and when I tried to call him, I got no answer. I tried several times and sent him several text messages, but it was radio silence.
So, we ended up getting an Uber. By the time we got to the hotel to drop off our packs, it was almost 10am. The start of the trailhead was about 20 minutes away. So, under best case circumstances, we wouldn't have been able to start until about 10:30am. Neither one of us wanted to risk getting in late, so we did not hike today.
First Breakfast: Nutri-Grain Apple Cinnamon Bar 
Second Breakfast: Sweet Black Pepper Breakfast Sandwich
Lunch: A hamburger and BBQ chips from the Apple Pie Bakery. It was fine, but a little undercooked for my taste. 
Dinner: A 6 piece chicken basket from Dairy Queen 
Dessert: A large Oreo blizzard","

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666477,"Today's rocky terrain was not as bad as previous days rocky terrain. It still wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible either.
It started with a fairly easy ascent out of Wind Gap. Then it was rocky ridge walking for several miles. Then at about 7 miles in, I got to Wolf Rocks. Now, I was reading about this section of the trail the night before and one person said that it was as difficult and dangerous as Knife's Edge a few days ago. Having not experienced it myself, I think that's an exaggeration. The rocks were mostly level and flat, so it really wasn't too difficult to walk over them. It also only lasted for at most maybe a quarter of a mile.
After Wolf Rocks, it was back to just more small jagged rocks. There were a few places that eased up for a bit, but not many and not for long.
I did end up making today's hike, if not more difficult, than at least a bit longer. At a point near the end, I missed the white blaze and went down a different path. I didn't realize it though until I was already kind of far into it and turning around would have meant going back uphill.
Fortunately the trail I was on did rejoin the AT further ahead, but unfortunately I think it was slightly longer. But, I still made it back to the hotel by about 2pm, so overall it was a good days hike.
The only other bit of news is that Pacer won't be hiking with me, at least not for a while. She didn't hike today, but instead is renting a car so that she can drive to New York to see family for a few days. She may hike some of the trail up there and then finish this section when she returns her rental later in the week.
She's not leaving until tomorrow, so we did drive into Stroudsberg for a bit and she's also dropping me off at my hiking point tomorrow morning. That'll save me a shuttle fee.
Breakfast: Two single serving bowls of Frosted Mini Wheat cereal.
Lunch: A bag of Golden Recipe Hearty Trail Mix
Recovery Drink: Half a gallon of chocolate milk
Dinner: Fried calamari, honey garlic glazed salmon, some kind of cheese risotto, and some vegetables from Sycamore Grille.
Dessert: Strawberry parfait from Apple Pie Bakery. It was pretty good, but it did have a bit of a weird taste.","Wind Gap

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666509,"This morning started out pretty pleasant. There were some rocks, but not too bad. There was even a nice road walk for a couple of miles. But, as the day wore on, it started to get really hot. I think the high today was supposed to be in the high 80s or low 90s, and it definitely felt like it.
I did take a blue blaze trail at about the 7 mile mark. It was down the Rattlesnake Swamp Trail. One of the comments on FarOut made it seem like it was worth taking because the flora and scenery were different. Maybe if I were a botanist I would have noticed a difference, but as it was, it didn't seem all that different to me. I did pass the Mohican Outdoor Center and there was a group there that let me fill up my water bottle, so that was nice.
Since I was slackpacking south, as I got closer to Pennsylvania, the trail started to get a lot rockier. I'd say close to after the Rattlesnake Swamp Trail is when it started. Then it was pretty much rocks for the next 6 miles or so until after Sunfish Pond.
The final stretch was about 2 miles. It was under and along the highway. It was all flat, but it was out in the sun, on asphalt and concrete, and it was at the end of a 20 mile hike so it was actually kind of tough.
But, I made it and now I'm hoping I can get an Uber driver to take me back up to Crater Lake so I can go the other way. Since there aren't any good slackpacking options, I'm going to carry my pack for a few days to another hostel up the trail. 
Breakfast: Two individual servings of Frosted Mini Wheat cereal

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666597,"Today was one of the toughest days I've had in a while. Even though it was only 12 miles, I had my full pack, it was hot, fairly rocky, and there were quite a few ups and downs.
It was also, I wouldn't go so far as to say enjoyable, but it was a very tolerable day. Since I was only doing 12 miles, I could take more and longer breaks and not feel like I was falling behind where I needed to be.
I actually didn't even get started until almost 9am. I was going to try an Uber up to Crater Lake earlier, but by 9:00pm last night, a driver still hadn't been reserved. So, I had to scramble to try and find a shuttle driver.
Fortunately I was able to get a hold of Misty who turned out to be awesome. She said she could pick me up at 8am from the hotel and it was about a 50 minute drive. When she dropped me off, she wasn't even going to charge me for it. I gave her a $20 for gas at least.
Anyway, even though I didn't get started until almost 9am, I still made it to Culver Gap, which was within 3 miles of the Gren Anderson shelter, by about 2:30pm. So, I walked down the road a little ways and hung out at the Mountain House Tavern and Grill for a few hours.
It just felt really good not having the pressure of having to do big miles. Though it did make me realize that I'm probably done slackpacking. I need to get back into pack carrying shape or I'm going to have an incredibly difficult time once I get further north into the New England states.
I'm still going to try and stay at hostels and hotels whenever I can though. I really like beds, showers, and clean clothes. But I'll just get to them with a full pack instead of a day pack.
I ended up getting to the shelter at about 6pm and there are two people tenting and no one in the shelter. So, I may end up having it all to myself tonight.
Breakfast: A sweet pepper bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich from Dunkin Donuts.
Lunch: A pulled pork sandwich with fries from The Mountain House Tavern and Grill.
Dinner: A tropical salad from the Mountain House Tavern and Grill. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It had greens, banana chips, pineapple, raisins, yogurt covered raisins, tomatoes, and goat cheese with a balsamic vinegar dressing. All of those things just didn't mix as well as it sounded on the menu.
I also had six glasses of lemonade in the few hours that I was there.","Crater Lake

Argonaut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666598,"Today was not as hot as yesterday, but it didn't seem to matter much because the humidity is still so high. It didn't take long before I was completely soaked through from sweating so much. It certainly didn't help that my clothes were still damp from sweating so much yesterday. But, I'm staying at a hostel tonight, so I'll get to at least get my clothes clean before they get soaked again tomorrow. Though they are calling for storms tomorrow and it looks like it might drop the temperature for a few days.
The hike wasn't terrible, but it's going to take some time getting used to carrying my full pack again. I had to stop and take a few breaks because I was so hot and tired. There are also some things inside it that I would like to get rid of once I get to a place that has a post office. That will hopefully help with the pack weight a little bit.
The other thing I may reconsider is sleeping in shelters. I used to prefer them because it made the mornings a little more hassle free. But, that was back when there were no biting flies, gnats, and mosquitoes I had to worry about. All night long I had bugs flying around me and on me. I tried to put myself under my sleeping bag, but it was so hot out that it quickly became uncomfortable. So, I'll probably start tenting instead of sleeping in the shelters so that I won't get chewed up while I'm trying to sleep.
Breakfast: Two Kind bars. One was milk chocolate almond. I don't know what the other one was.
Lunch: Fries, a large oreo blizzard, and a root beer. I was also supposed to have a triple hamburger, but they gave me the wrong sandwich and I didn't realize it until we were already at the hostel.
Dinner: Beef and broccoli, pork fried rice, and an egg roll from Good Friends chinese restaurant. 
I also drank a 52oz bottle of Simply Lemonade.  I think I'm trying to make up for all the years I didn't drink the stuff.
Dessert: Watermelon. It was decent, but not as flavorful as I've had before.","Gren Anderson Shelter
