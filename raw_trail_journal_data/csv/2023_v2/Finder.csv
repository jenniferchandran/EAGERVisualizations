We started in Georgia and had good times and shared many stories and adventures, but it seemed that the trail started to turn against us in eastern Pennsylvania, at least for me. We trekked many days in over 100 degree heat index days with almost daily thunderstorms and high humidity. We got to Bear Mountain just about the time that one of the hurricanes that year, turned tropical storm on the east coast, hit us. From that point on, we hiked in rain or in water almost continuously.  The Housatonic River reached flood stage and a small section of the AT was rerouted a day or two after we crossed through the swamps.  We had to turn around one time because the creek was too high. By the time we got to mid Vermont, I had developed infections on my feet and what amounted to 'trench foot' from hiking daily with wet feet.  I needed time off for my feet to heal, but I also was done mentally with the trail as well. So, I came off the trial not to return that year.
I decided to do a 'western' trail in 2022 and hiked the CDT in one shot in about 4-1/2 months, planning to return to the AT and complete it in 2023. Because of other plans this year, I could not start the AT until about August 1. Who would have thought that 2023 would prove to be an even wetter year, with bigger storms than in 2021. I have to say that I'm a little apprehensive about hiking an even longer continuously muddy or wet trail section, but it is what it is, and I have tickets to fly into Rutland on July 31 and resume, and hopefully complete, my AT hike this year.",,View Entry,"Jul 28, Fri",0
Finder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667456,"I started getting serious with training hikes in June 2023. One of the hikes was along the Lost Coast of California (part of King Range), a section of the coast with no roads and is mostly natural and undeveloped in Humboldt and Mendocino counties. I started in Shelter Cove and did an out and back hike to avoid logistics with trying to shuttle a car. It was beautiful and a very different type of hike walking mostly over loose sand. The tides are a significant issue because there are pinch points along the beach where you cannot hike when the tide is high, and this is no joke. I went when there was a full moon and got to experience minus tides and saw many tide pools. I included a photo from a section of the beach that reminded me of AT trail sections.",,View Entry,"Jul 29, Sat",0
Finder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667519,"On July 22 we went up to the Sierras near Pinecrest Lake to spend a week at a family camp. I used the time to hike the nearby Sierra trails. It was fun to get some altitude in the hikes, and they went well. Although, I tried some cross country along the river and ended up doing scrambling and some minor climbing, so I was sore in my shoulders and arms. I'm using a Hyperlite pack for the first time on this hike because of the rain and wetness. I wished it had some sort of sealable pouch for waterproof easy access to a spoon or headlamp instead of opening the pack every time I need something. I did buy a waterproof pouch to mount on my pack strap to put my phone in. Also, I'll be carrying an umbrella and an Ursack as well as some cool weather clothes like a puffy, R1, and cap. The umbrella helps keep the rain off my shoulders and keeps me more comfortable. I used the umbrella for the first time last year and it worked well for sun and thunderstorms. The Ursack is to keep all the little critters from chewing through my tent as well as for bears (otherwise I'd keep food in my tent).  Since I'll be hiking into September and at some higher altitudes I figure I might need some cool weather gear. I went back and forth about this, including sending a package somewhere in the Whites, but figured it was just a couple of pounds and didn't want to hassle with timing a pick up. Hopefully, I don't regret this decision. I expect to hike in running shorts and have a rain skirt and shell for the rain. I leave tomorrow for Rutland via Boston.",,View Entry,"Jul 30, Sun",0
Finder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667540,"Today was my flight out from San Francisco to Boston on Alaska Airlines which then connected with Cape Air on to Rutland, Vermont. The Alaska flight went well. I was worried because I had to retrieve my pack from the Alaska baggage carousel, then walk over to another terminal and check in to Cape Air, then go back through security in a short time. Everything went well, too well.
As I sat in the Cape Air waiting area with a half hour to go before boarding, Cape Air canceled my flight. I got a text notification and immediately went up to the agent. He didn’t even know it was canceled at first (due to weather in Rutland). I asked him what I should do, and he suggested taking a bus to a town in New Hampshire. Not even close.
Instead, I got the last seat on the 1:40 flight the next day; this was before he even announced it to the waiting area. At about the same time, I got a text from MoJoe asking how things were going. So I talked to MoJoe, who lives in the Boston area, and he offered to put me up for the night. Great guy. But, first I had to retrieve my pack, which was sketchy because it didn’t turn up in the baggage area until a cart showed up with just my pack on it. Then, I jumped on a bus, luckily the right one, which took me to the subway that took me to the end of the line to meet MoJoe. We went out to dinner with his wife, and I had a wonderful time. They even took me on a tour of historical sites. But, I’m still looking for Charlie to get him off of the MTA, especially as I went through the Kendall Square station.",,View Entry,"Jul 31, Mon",0

Then MoJoe drove me to the airport to catch my flight. The flight was a little late departing but made it to Rutland. It was fun flying in a small 8 passenger seat airplane. One lucky passenger got to sit in the copilot seat. 


Tom, my shuttle driver, was there to meet me in Rutland and drove me to the trailhead with a quick stop to pick up fuel along the way. I started walking about 5 pm and made quick work to the top of Mt Bromley. It is beautiful this evening with just a few clouds and no rain! It is cold with temps to go below 50 degrees and a stiff wind. I set up my tent even though there is a ski patrol shelter. There’s also a privy.","VT 11/30

Finder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667644,"It was a very good day on the trail. No mud, because the trail has actually dried, no rain, and my first trail magic. At one of the forest service road crossings, Odessimo gave me an ice cream sandwich.


Lots of ""downs"" today. I saw a couple of damaged bridges and some bridges with debris still stacked against the railings. Also, there was a small section of trail washed away, but it wasn’t a big deal. I heard from my shuttle driver that an AT hiker was swept away crossing a creek recently and died. I passed about 8 SOBOs today and caught up with one NOBO, Pancake. He dropped off the trail last year because of feet problems, and he came back on just a week ago to finish. Strange coincidence. 


The shelter is 0.2 mile off of the trail. The shelter is small, and I am in my tent tonight hoping for no rain. There are about 6 hikers here.
Now a group of teenagers on a camp trip arrived, lots of yelling. Water is very low flow, mosquitoes are high.","Mt. Bromley

Finder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667646,"Today I hiked 5,700 feet in elevation ending up at Cooper Lodge on Killington Peak elevation 3,898 feet. It’s not really a lodge, more of a rock hut way past it’s prime with a leaky roof, graffiti, and no shutters. I got a little rain at the end of the hike, so it was nice to get to the hut, then the rain stopped. But, I hear thunder in the distance. Killington Peak is also the top of a big ski resort. Tomorrow I plan to drop into the town and do a resupply.



The trail was pretty today. While crossing a high suspension bridge, I got a view of Rutland and a raging gorge. At noon, I hiked about a third of a mile off trail to a small farm stand and got maple ice cream, maple soda, and maple cookies, and I’m not even in Maine.
I got to the hut right before a dozen teenage boys and their leader got here. Per some rule, he wasn't allowed to occupy the hut, but there wasn’t enough space anyway. The boys are camped next door and they are rambunctious. It’s only 6 pm, and it is getting very dark; the thunderstorm may be on its way.


Lastly, even though I trained in my running shorts for hiking in rain on the AT, the last couple of miles in wet shorts gave me a terrible rash in the neither regions, and I am uncomfortable. Tomorrow I will try a different combination.","Greenwell Shelter

Finder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667719,"Last night was a rough night. Big thunderstorms rolled in, and the shelter leaked badly. When the first storm hit I heard the water gush in and jumped up to check my pack but not before some water got into the inner liner. Then it was dripping around my quilt. I move things around and hung up clothes. I ended up setting up my umbrella inside and to get a dry place to sleep. There was lighting most of the night, occasionally with bluish white bright flashes and an immediate crack. I bet the bolts came down around the ski lifts. 


With the chaffing yesterday, I decided to wear my Kuhn shorts. In the end, this was a mistake and is why I stopped early today. I did make it down the old AT route to Sherbrorn Pass before the first thunderstorm hit. I road walked to Killington deli for a resupply and some food.


With the rain and still sweating while doing a climb, I was drenched with no dry clothes for tomorrow (nothing ever dries on the AT anyway). Then I got cold on the downhill so, with the next shelter 10 miles away, I called it a day. I’ve hung my wet clothes, but that’s what I’ll wear tomorrow. Chaffing may be a problem. The mosquitoes are relentless here too.


Half a mile north from the shelter is Stony Brook. A couple of weeks ago during the deluge, a hiker tried to cross it and was swept away. There are memorials in the the shelter log book to Steady Eddie. May he Rest In Peace.
I met a hiker who’s on his eighth AT hike. We were 4 altogether in the shelter including Fire Flow and Chuckser. It rained and thundered all afternoon, nothing like you would ever see in the Bay Area.","Cooper Lodge (Killington Peak)

The highlight of the day was getting to a farm stand (On the Edge) right at noon after a 6:30 am start from the shelter. They had great pre- made sandwiches, and I bought cheese and beef sticks. The woman who runs it was very nice.


Today had a lot of ups and downs in the beautiful green tunnel. Lots of big trees and a couple of places in the woods I saw lots of tubing. I think they get maple sap. It was a 5,300 foot ascent day, and I think I’m getting some blisters with the wet socks. Even with no rain you sometimes walk through bogs. I made a reservation for a motel in Hanover from one of the ridge tops.","Stony Brook Shelter

Finder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667772,"After spending a great night sleeping in my tent, I got up and was walking by 6:30 am. Even though there was no rain and it was a beautiful morning, the meadows and lower slope bogs quickly got my feet wet and kept them wet as I descended into the low fog in the valley.


I crossed a bridge at a large river, the White River, and was hailed at a street corner on the other end of the bridge by Randy at the ""Blue Barn"" to come over for a cup of coffee. While I was there, Randy and another hiker, Oh Lord, talked about their military service. Randy had a nice dog and cat as well as fresh eggs from his hen house.


I walked in and was soon met by Scare Crow and Violet who were doing top notch Trail Magic by the side of the road. They had finished the first half of the AT this year and decided to give back to the community. They had quite a spread, and I chose a hot dog and and donuts. Not wanting to be too late getting to Hanover, I continued on.


It was easy hiking into Norwich, VT where I went off trail a bit to go to a store to get two days of food and a microwave burrito for dinner tonight. The motel looked out of the way, and I didn’t know if I would be able to walk anywhere for food or groceries.


I continued on crossing the Connecticut River into New Hampshire. I walked up the road to downtown Hanover and saw part of Dartmouth College. I had a two mile road walk to the motel, so I tried to hitch and was quickly picked up by Hank, a very nice guy, and his son. He dropped me off at the Sunset Motel and sure enough I was 2 miles from anything. There I met Lego, also a hiker, and I was able to dry out my pack and other items in the sun this afternoon. I ended the day by doing my laundry and having a pizza delivered to my room.","Thistle Hill Shelter

I saw Lego for breakfast, and we took the bus together. Soon after rounding the Dartmouth soccer field though, I pulled ahead of Lego. Then the rain started, and it rained pretty much all day. I got to the shelter just as Bane and Nutella were leaving after finding a hotel nearby with a shuttle pick up one mile away. Very tempting. Bat 9 is with them, and he started a fire in the burned down cabin fireplace. How he managed that I have no idea.


I'm with Entropy presently and he told me there is a flood watch issued for the next couple of days.","Hanover (Sunset Motel)

Finder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667899,"After a night of rain, I woke up and heard Entropy saying that it’s not suppose rain today until afternoon. I quickly got packed and was walking by 6:30 am in a light drizzle with lots of drippy trees and wet bushes.



The trail was flowing with water and slippery with flat areas that were very boggy. At a trail junction going up Smart Mountain, I took the Ranger Trail alternate, which was the old AT and the route rangers took to get to the top of the mountain and the fire lookout. It was still a steep and slippery climb, some of it over smooth rocks. At the top is the lookout and an old small cabin. The cabin had four packed hikers spending the night there.
Down Smart Mountain I went then started up Cube Mountain stopping early at Hexacuba Shelter. I needed to let my shriveled feet dry out for the day, and for the hike, if I wanted to continue.


The shelter is a log and post shelter shaped like a hexagon. The privy is a lopsided pentagon, the Pentaprivy. So for now, I’m here with Novice and Entropy, but more hikers may show up. The afternoon has some sunlight rays. I’m thinking of hiking to a hostel tomorrow to get recharged and find out about upcoming slackpack options.","Trapper John Shelter

Finder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667900,"Overnight it rained quite a bit but stopped before sunrise. I got a late start leaving about 7 am to finish climbing Mt. Cube.


Just after the summit, I found an umbrella on the ground. I put it in my pack and continued down the wet and muddy trail to a road intersection. Alongside of the road was another major Trail Magic hosted by Father Time. He made me a couple of breakfast tacos. The wind had picked up and got cold but it was tacos!


I had another minor climb before getting to Hikers Welcome Hostel, which is a short walk off the trail along a road. When I got to the hostel, I asked in the main room if anyone had lost an umbrella. They said someone outside had. So I found Bat 3, the guy who had started the fire the other night, and gave him his umbrella. He was minutes away from leaving to stay at another hostel. Bane and Nutella were going with him.


After that, I was able to quickly get my laundry and shower done. As I was getting my stuff together in the main house, a call came out that a van was leaving for the grocery store down the road, so I jumped at the chance to get dinner and breakfast. 


As we drove into town (Warren),  I saw an ICBM missile in the middle of the town square next to the church. I realized that about 12 years ago on a fall vacation I drove through the same town with my wife and a couple of our good friends, Tom and Lori. What a coincidence.


I went back to planning my next couple of days, and after some back and forth and a timely reservation cancellation, I should be staying at the Notch Hostel and may get to slack back one day. Good thing too, because the skin on my feet is not looking very good.","Hexacuba Shelter

I don’t think it gets any better on the AT than going over Mt. Moosilauke on a clear calm day. My shoes and socks even stayed dry all day, and my feet are as good as they were this morning.



The trail today goes up at 1,100 feet per mile and then drops down over rugged jagged rocks at almost 1,300 feet per mile. It was designed to follow a cascade/ waterfall down the mountain, and luckily they installed wooden block steps at a few of the steepest sections. The mountaintop is at 4,800 feet with my starting elevation of 1,800 feet. I got one minor scrape from a wayward tree stump. Tomorrow is supposed to be a real hard 16 mile day that I’m going to slack pack between Kinsman Notch and Franconia notch.
The hostel is very nice and clean, and they have a lot of rules and procedures, compared to yesterday which was a ‘yeah whatever’ hostel. Both worked for me. The weather is suppose to turn a bit sour tomorrow. We are getting sprinkles this evening.","Hikers Welcome Hostel
",Kinsman Notch (Notch Hostel),"Aug 10, Thu",9.70
Finder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667947,"I had another big hiking day although the miles don’t show it. I started at 1800 feet elevation and climbed up to the South Kinsmen at 4,333 feet elevation with grades of 1,300 feet per mile. After that, we went down before going back up to North Kinsmen, then down some crazy steep grades and granite slabs. My knees are barking. The weather was good all things considered. Afternoon had sunlight, morning had a light sprinkle but no rain. The trail was wet as usual. At the top of Kinsmen we saw a tow airplane release a glider that then flew right over us. 


I hiked with Arete today, a 65 year old urologist from Texas. It was his first day on the trail. He’d left the trail last year due to injury and was coming back on. He is doing Moosilauke tomorrow, who knows, maybe we will meet again. We did this stretch in 9 hours 45 minutes. Pretty good for old timers. We even had to do three large creek crossings that we figured out how to rock hop without having to ford the stream just by going a couple of hundred feet upstream.


When we got to the pickup spot, which was 1 mile south of the AT, the shuttle driver drove right past us. Luckily, another hostel shuttle driver saw us running in the parking lot and took us back to our hostel. Thanks Jeff from Old Colony (recommended). At the end of the day, I saw Arete, and he has decided to go home. Too hard, too soon.

Apparently it was the first nice weekend (Saturday) in awhile, and there were mobs of day hikers and runners all going up on the ridge. It is also a thing here to summit all New Hampshire peaks over 4,000 feet, and there are a few such peaks here.



The day started off with a 4,200 foot climb after getting shuttled from the hostel to the Flume Visitor Center. I went up and over Little Haystack Mountain, Mt, Lincoln, North Mt. Lincoln, Mt. Lafayette, and Mt. Garfield. I ate my lunch of tortillas and Gruyère cheese on Mt. Lafayette. After Mt. Lafayette, it was hard constantly climbing up and down rocks and boulders.

It threaten to rain in the morning, but by afternoon the sun peaked out. My first stop was Galehead hut to see if I could buy some extra food, but staff was no where to be found. The hut is very remote and overlooks wilderness area.


I cruised on to the next hut, Zealand hut. This is a nice hut located next to a waterfall. I bought a large cookie and muffin there and had my lunch. The next five miles was mostly flat and easy, and I think was an old railroad grade. The shelter tonight is small and smells of kerosene. We are located next to a large pond. The shelter and tent sites are full tonight. 


Last night my inflatable pillow went flat, so since I’m next to a pond, I took my pillow apart and tested the plastic inner inflatable in the pond and found a leak. I have some bike tube patches with me, so I used one to seal the leak and then covered it with tenacious tape. It looks like it holds air.


Tomorrow I should have a short day because you can’t camp in the alpine zone near Mt Washington. I’ll stop short at Mizpah Hut. Then the plan is to make a fast 14 mile run if the weather is good. I do have a plan B to go down the mountain at Lake of the Clouds in poor weather.","Garfield Shelter

I went over Mt. Webster and Mt. Jackson before arriving at Mizpah Hut at noon. They had left over breakfast of cold pancakes and eggs, so I ate that for lunch. The weather forecast for today was as good as it gets, no rain, winds below 60 mph at the mountain tops, but worsening conditions for tomorrow. So, on I went instead of staying at the Mizpah tent site.


I went over Mt. Pierce, past Mt. Eisenhower and Monroe, and over Mt Franklin, to the Lake of the Clouds hut. When I got there at 2:30 pm, I was the first to ask about ""work-for-stay""  but had to wait until 4 pm to make it official. Right at 4 pm Mo Dang showed up, so we were both drafted into dishwashing duty. After an hour of dishwashing, we were done until after dinner. The staff was very friendly to us and appreciated our work.


As Mo Dang and I we’re waiting by the front door, in walk Cornbread and Engineer Bill (who I met a couple of days ago), and they where able to sign up for work-for-stay too. This hut lets four hikers do the stay instead of the normal two because the hut is bigger. However, we had to wait until the guests were done with dinner, then sweep and clean tables before we could eat. We had a great dinner of chicken, quinoa, and vegetables. My favorite dish was the corn chowder with corn bread and butter.
We had to wait until ‘lights out’ around 9 pm before we could sleep on the dinning room floor. I managed to snag a bench to sleep on, but the bathroom traffic all night long kept waking me up.","Ethan Pond Shelter

I quickly got ready along with the other three hikers. As soon as we got going, it started to rain. Onward we went up 1,500 feet to the summit, where the highest ground level wind speed ever recorded was 231 mph. Three days ago the hut recorded 90 mph wind gusts. Luckily for us, wind speeds were low, low enough for me to use my umbrella. We got to the summit before any shops were open. But I remembered taking the cog steam locomotive with Donna, Lori and Tom on a fall leaf peeping trip. A lot of construction is currently going on, I think to replace water and wastewater tanks. The trail goes over the cog railroad tracks where it is apparently a thing for hikers to moon the train as it goes by. Oh well, too early for any trains today.


I hiked past Mt. Clay and Mt. Jefferson, over Adams Five, by Quincy Adams, and over the top of Mt. Madison. Coming down Mt. Madison was a crazy steep rocky descent. I stopped at Madison Spring hut and bought a piece of chocolate cake. Mo Dang came in, and we both used our AMC card coupon for a bowl of soup. It was seven bean. It warmed me up. The rain had stopped by then, and I had a 1,000 foot climb.


Overall I did 3900 feet of ascent and 6300 feet of descent. I don’t think I’ve done that much downhill ever in one day and my knees are feeling it. A couple of beers in town should help ease the pain before tomorrow when I start in on the Wildcats. It will be another big up day. Rain with chance of thunderstorms is forecasted, so what else is new.


Meanwhile, while descending Mt. Madison I stopped to get reservations at the Barn Hostel in Gorham. I hustled to try to catch a 4 pm bus out of Pinkham Notch, but I missed it by about 10 minutes. So I hung around the parking lot of the visitor center until I was able to hustle a ride to Gorham. I’ve already met an interesting cast of characters at the hostel, which has a large open dormitory of beds on the second floor. We shall see how I sleep tonight. I managed to do my laundry and take a shower before walking 20 minutes to a Dollar General only to find out it closed at 6 pm. Now my resupply will have to come from a gas station mini mart.

Paul also shuttled us this morning in a vintage Cadillac to the trailhead at Pinkham Visitor center. Stay classy Gorham. But the Wildcats are wild. On the initial climb out of the valley, I had to put my poles in my pack and free climb a trail section, no joke. You had to use hand holds and pull yourself up. 


By noon, I got to the Carter Notch hut which I think is the last of the AMC huts. The hut is very remote and very small. But I got out of the mist and drizzle, and used my coupon for a piece of cornbread that I ate with my lunch inside the small dining room. By the time I left, the drizzle had stopped, but I was in clouds or fog all day. There was no real rain, and my shoes stayed fairly dry (since it was very rocky). I was able to call the Barn Hostel on top of Carter Dome and made a two night reservation. I’ve been pushing hard, and I feel I need a zero day. Plus, I need new shoes as my Altra Olympus sidewall fabric is shredding from all of the rocks and sliding  which is also starting to punch holes in my socks.


Not to be out done, the last major descend of the day to get to the shelter also needed to be down climbed. Some areas are 20 feet of near vertical slabs of granite, one slip and you will be injured.


The shelter is a nice newly constructed two level shelter with a small porch. Very nice but 0.3 miles off trail. I paid my 5 dollars to the caretaker for the night.

While I was waiting for a ride into town from the hostel owner, Paul, a guy at the trailhead gave me a large cookie as trail magic. He had done the AT in 2018, and now he was doing all of the NH 4,000 footers in three weeks. So he was headed up the trail.


When I got to town, my first stop was to the small outfitter/hardware store to buy new shoes (Merrell Moab) as my Altras' side fabric had ripped open. The store only had the Merrells and only Darn Tough socks. When I got back to the hostel, I found out another hiker (Tumbleweed) was paying to shuttle to an REI for new shoes with another hiker who needed a tent (he lost his tent on the trail). So I asked Tumbleweed if she could buy me some Smart Wool socks. The Darn Tough socks seem to rub my feet and cause rashes.


I went to the Dollar General for a resupply. Along the way I did a bit of sightseeing:  I saw a line of railroad cars and engines on display, the City Hall, and a Farmers Market. When I got back, Tumbleweed gave me a new pair of socks.

But the new soles, or maybe the material formulation, was treacherous in the rain and wet trail conditions. I kept sliding especially on the wet slick granite slabs. I took one significant slip but only had a minor scrape. It concerns me because the next two days are suppose to be rocky.




The rain today was short lived, about an hour this morning, and by the time I got to the shelter at 2:30 the sun came peaking out. I wanted to go farther but comments from a couple of SOBOs discouraged me. I probably would not have gotten to the next shelter 5.5 miles away until 6 pm and would have had another 2,000 feet of climbing for an over 6,000 climb day. Also, there were no reported good camp sites at the top of the next big climb if I wanted to go halfway to the next shelter.
The shelter I’m at is very nicely constructed and clean, especially after I swept out both upper and lower decks. The bear box though has trash in it. The shelter has a nice view of mountains across the valley and also has quick access to a picturesque pond and cliffs. One of the nicer shelter settings I’ve been at this year.
I saw three snakes today including one right next to the shelter. Time to dry my gear from the morning rain between afternoon rain showers.","Route 2 Androscoggin River (Gorham)

I think it took me about two hours at the end of the day to do the one mile, and I am beat. It is a rock and boulder jumble that you need to figure out how to climb over or under (sliding through tunnels) and sometimes free climbing or jumping from rock to rock with 15 foot free falls. 
I have a nice tent spot and I was just joined by four hikers that I’ve seen a few times before; Captain, Navigator, Flik, and Three TAC. I am also now a Mainer having left New Hampshire and the White Mountains behind.


We started the day with a high overcast and high winds. The overcast cleared by mid-afternoon, and I had some sunny moments over high points. I went over six mountain tops. The clouds have come in, and it might rain tonight. There were a number of plank boardwalks today, including trick broken ones that if you didn’t recognize they were broken you’d step into a bog up to your crotch (I saw a hiker yesterday covered in mud). I found a spork today that I ended up giving to Navigator so she could scrape her pot better.

I started off with a big climb along the Mahoosuc Arm into the clouds and was soon caught by Mo Dang, who had camped at a shelter just north of the arm. We walked together for a while before splitting up on the long descent to Grafton Notch. The descent was hard on the knees but nice with a number of cascades. When we got to the bottom at Grafton Notch, Sherpa had Trail Magic set up with a number of hikers milling about. It was noon, so I was able to enhance my calories.


We then had a long climb up to the top of Bald Peak Mountain, which had nice long dry granite slabs to walk on similar to the Sierras. There were also great views of all the surrounding mountains. Mo Dang and I walked together off and on, ending up at Frye Lean-to where we both decided to tent since the forecast tonight is for no rain.


On the climb out of Grafton Notch, I found a sit pad and flag on the trail that I had seen on one of the hikers at the trail Magic parking lot. Half way up the mountainside, I caught up to the hiker and was able to give him his items. Finder strikes again.

Earl even signed the underside of the dining room table as the Crazy One in 1998. I had dinner with the host and other hikers, and then signed the underside too.

This morning we had blueberry pancakes, sausage, and pan fried potatoes made by the cook, Kitchen Sink.


After a hearty breakfast, seven hikers got in a six seat van and went to the trail head. We started by doing a 2,260 foot climb up Old Blue Mountain. The views under blue skies today were wonderful. We saw lots of ponds and lakes, the largest being Rangeley Lake. The trail at first was a little muddy and bouldery but soon had a lot of nice dry granite slab walks amongst tons of blueberries. I would just grab a handful walking along the trail. Overall, we had 5,200 feet of ascent and 4,400 feet of descent.


When we got close to Bemus Stream, we had to cross an old railroad grade turned gravel road. There we came across a set up with the most amazing Trail Magic ever with a lot of very nice friendly locals that cooked and talked with you. I had a bacon cheeseburger, a Maine Red Dog (first time), and a Moxie (a Maine soft drink that taste to me like a combination Coke, Dr Pepper and Root Beer). Blink was there with his banjo (yes he is carrying a banjo on the AT) strumming out songs for ambiance. There were a lot of homemade baked goods that I brought with me for dinner tonight. No need to fire up the camp stove. 


After the special trail magic, we had a 1,000 foot climb to a Maine Highway and vista point where there was more roadside Trail Magic, I drank an ice tea. After some more smaller ups and downs, I got to the lean-to which is next to a small lake. I’m tenting next to Mo Dang.

I had a plan, and everything was going well with a 20 mile, 5,000 foot day to get to a shelter before a big storm tonight and tomorrow. I was climbing Saddleback Mtn nearly at the top over granite slabs when I felt a twinge in my right leg above the knee. As I walked, it got tighter and tighter and when I tried to start my descent over steep boulders, I found I had no strength in my right leg and was in a lot of pain.


So I turned around and hiked/limped back to the mountain top and beyond where there was a trail junction that took you down 1.7 miles to the Saddleback Mtn ski resort lodge. I called for a motel room at the Saddleback Inn in Rangerley, Maine at the mountain top. I could barely walk downhill but soon got to the top of a ski lift where there was a worker. I asked about a way down and if he was by chance getting ready to go down. Ultimately, I walk slowly down the cat track while Josh went down the mountain in his two wheeler and then came back up with a larger two passenger ATV. I don’t know what I would have done or know how long it would have taken me to walk down the mountain if Josh hadn’t picked me up. At the lodge, Josh got me some ice for my leg. I also took a lot of Vitamin I.


While outside at the lodge, I met the head of marketing, trail name Clover, who had walked the AT and volunteered to drive me to Rangeley. Once at the motel, the manager, Paula, ordered me a pizza and drove to the store to pick it up and then to another store for a beer, for me. Once laying down with the Ibuprofen and beer I felt better, but we will see. Clover is leaving for Bangor tomorrow, a potential return home, or I have two nights and a zero in Rangeley. I will see in the morning, hopefully it is just overuse since the pain is widespread and mid thigh.


Earlier in the day at Piazza Rock Lean-to, Mathew and another guy had a cook out for hikers. I had Moose chop suey (moose meat, macaroni, and butter) and homemade cookies. It was delicious and hot and gave me energy for the 2,200 foot climb up Saddleback.

I can walk but can I hike over boulders and down steep steps all day is the question. I’ll find out tomorrow as I’m paying for a shuttle to take me at 6 am back up to Saddleback Ski Resort where I’ll reclimb Saddleback mountain top. I’m still very sore above the knee.


As I walked around town, it was sad to see the AT hikers coming into town all wet and muddy. They looked very miserable. I must have seen a dozen hikers. Also, a second story hotel guest left the shower full on, and it flooded a first floor room. Lots of construction activity as the ceiling was totally ripped out.

My leg was good enough to hike and I planned to take it slow but still do about 15 miles today to a certain lean-to. As I slowly started down a very steep wet granite slab I suddenly slipped and landed hard in my right hip and right elbow, scraping and bruising both, while re-injuring my pulled muscle. So much for my plan. I managed to drag myself to the Poplar Ridge Lean-to by noon and decided to call it a day. I took a bunch of Ibuprofen and laid down, and bandaged my scrapes.

I also did my first river ford of Orbeton Stream, so had wet feet all day.


I did pass the 200 mile rocks on the trail that I think means there is less than 200 miles to go to the end.

The Bigelows are the last ""serious"" mountains I have to hike with 5,100 feet of climbing before I reach Mt. Katahdin. I went over two 4,000 foot peaks, down to as low as 1,200 feet today. I started walking and climbing in the fog and mist for the first half of the day. I walked with a knee brace that I found in the hiker box and kept taking Ibuprofen.

For $40 I got a cabin room (no heat or electricity), a shower, and will be getting a big pancake breakfast in the morning. Other hikers at the lean-to have signed up for the breakfast, I think Tim will take 15 maximum. When I first arrived, I ran into Captain, Navigator, and Three TAC.

This rustic lodge has an incredible history. Franklin Roosevelt’s only daughter, Anna, came here on her honeymoon and caught a big trout right at the base of the falls by the lodge. The fish is mounted in the lodge. It’s so rustic that the pool table is shimmed up to ten inches to level it. I am writing this journal by the light of a kerosene lamp.
I went by Dead River Pond. I saw a sign about Benedict Arnold’s March to attack Quebec. The AT follows the route of his portage by East Carry Pond and West Carry Ponds. What the sign doesn’t say is that I think he was unsuccessful in the attack because he got ‘bogged down’ in the bogs around here. (I’ll need to check my facts.)

I got to the Kennebec River, and the ferryman was just taking the first NOBO hikers to the east bank. This river is very wide and is the largest unbridged crossing on the AT. A ferryman, paid for by the ATC, paddles a canoe to take hikers across the river. The canoe even has a white blaze in the bottom of the hull. You, have to sign a waiver and you must where a floatation device before crossing.

Once there, I had to wait until the ranger came back at 7 am to register and get my permit. I also got a day pack and emptied most of my pack in it and left the day pack in a shelter while I used my pack for water, food, and other essentials.


I started hiking on the Hunt Trail and soon encountered boulders and large steps requiring my arms to lift me over. But, this was only the warm up. The trail got more difficult and require some technical climbing to get over a rocky ridge line, a few times with assistance from bolted metal rungs or a metal post (so you had something to grab). It was steep, tough, and required some strength and flexibility to get through this section. After a false summit, I had about a mile of fairly flat to mild slope of small rocks to get to the summit. It took me 3 hours 20 minutes to summit.


At first, the skies were clear, then midway clouds and some evaporating fog formed. But, by the time I reached the summit, the low clouds disappeared, and we had nice weather for about an hour or two before big cumulus clouds started forming. Later that night, after I got off the mountain, we had quite a lightning show then rain.


Back on top though, I got my ceremonial photos by the signboard. I was amazed by how precipitous the back side of the mountain is. The ridge line also continued for 1-1/2 miles along the Knife’s Edge. A couple of hikers continued on and did the Knife's Edge and ended on the far side of the mountain. One of them had their parents drive them back to the start.


For my return, I took a different trail down the mountain, the Abol Trail, and had a couple miles of road walk to the starting point. I actually met up with Juneau, and we got a hitch for the last mile. The Abol Trail was not as technical, but it was very steep and jarring on the knees. It was also more sheltered from the wind.


Half way down the mountain, I got cell service and called and made reservations at the 100 Mile Wilderness hostel in Millanocket, Maine which included a 4 pm shuttle from Katahdin Stream ranger station. It felt good to get to the hostel after 6 consecutive humid, sweaty days on the trail. Most of the hikers there had all summited that day, so we all went out to the local cafe to celebrate. It was a pizza place, but they didn't have pizza because they lost power and were running on a generator. I had penobscot fries (fries topped with beef gravy and Monterey Jack cheese) and haddock. Back at the hostel, we sat outside and watched the lightning until it started to rain. I completed 542 miles in 38 days, what a way to end the AT.","Abel Pines (West Branch Penobscot River)
