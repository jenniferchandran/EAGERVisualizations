Our plan is to share this journal with family and friends so they can check in at their convenience and track our progress during our AT adventure.  I don't plan to post every day but hopefully a minimum of once a week with a picture or two.
What are we doing right now?:  training, buying everything REI makes and scrutinizing and re-scrutinizing what to take, and noodling on logistics.  Scout is pondering how she will carry Sealy posturepedic, memory foam, dog bed. You can tell her. I'm not. 

It will indeed take a village and we are grateful for the support.
April 14th is right around the corner.  Getting excited.

But today was my first time practicing with my actual planned pack content. The good news is, that without food, the pack is coming in at only 18 pounds. The bad news is I don’t think I can stuff anything else in there. :). Adjustments to come…. This is also the first remote/mobile journal entry test. Here goes nothing..",,Home,"Feb 12, Sun",8

It’s hard to lead a pack of humans..  They only listen to me some of the time. But on the best of the best vacations they seem to be following my lead:  Eat. Walk. Eat. Sleep and repeat. (I prefer a bit more sleep but this is still awesome). They talk allot until they hit the uphills & then they mostly breathe loudly.  I told them if they used all 4 legs they’d do better.  I mostly loved our 1st night campground.   Everyone let me clean their food bags after diner.  I loved Mr. Steve’s beef stroganoff.  Mom & Dad’s chicken teriyaki was pretty good.  Mr. Bob’s chicken pot pie wasn’t very good but I ate it to help out. I’m a team player .  Unfortunately the combo gave me gas, but I think mom & dad loved it.  At least every time I tooted in the tent, they laughed.  My only complaint is that dad needs to move over because I can’t quite get balanced on his pad. I’m surprised he forgot my memory foam.  But on the bright side, so far I haven’t had any trouble getting everyone to go to bed as soon as it gets dark. (At home, they don’t listen when I say it’s time.)
On the trail, I’m definitely in charge.  Everyone follows me.  Either Bob or Dad is first, then Steve, then Mom is the slowest, but I make sure we don’t leave her.
Day 2 was longer but fun.  We met several Boy Scout troops and they were all impressed that I was carrying my own pack.  I’m pretty sure we’ll go to bed early tonight because there was a lot of groaning when we set up the tents.  Plus, I need to rest up because they’d be lost without me.
Stats:  
Elapsed hiking time ~7 hours ( including a 30 min stop for Mom to take a shower.  She says we should never hike past a free hot water shower, even if it’s only Day 2)

One man down.Then 4 hours into our hike today, Robert started experiencing shooting pain in his knee & hip.  He’s had it before, but we had hoped his training & PT would allow him to make it work.  Trail angel Tim picked up Robert & Scout & carried them home to re-group.  Currently their plan is to run pit crew and follow us for section & day hikes after a little healing. 😔 Two men, plus furry chaperone down.And then there were two.Will miss the band, especially Robert & Scout (for the record it looked like she was more disappointed than anyone)Specs:  Elapsed hiking time:  8 hours including ~45 minute break.Gross elevation changes: 1400ft.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662234,"Last night was rainy & cold, but gave me a good chance to make sure I knew how to do everything (make camp, cook, water, bear bag) without Robert & Scout.  Thanks to Robert fine tutelage, the tent survived the night & I stayed dry. Check check.  We were the only 2 tents, but there were 5 solo hikers in the shelters at Raven Rock.  Much easier in & out.  Since we don’t have Scout ( must tent with dog), we might try the shelter tonight.
Otherwise, another good day. Alternating Rock fields to navigate & forest & fields.  It’s surprising how much energy it takes to concentrate on your next few footfalls among the rocks.  Just like in mogul skiing, crossing highways & probably anything else, “Indecision Kills”.
We had a nice meet up with Robert & Scout at PennMar Park.  He brought cold cokes & donuts.  Yum!! And helped with pack reallotments. And took a short out & back hike.  We’ll see them again in 2 days.
And once we reached Tumbling Rock Shelter, it looked like the perfect place to try out the shelters…..a Snoring shelter for Steve😊. And a non snoring shelter for me.  Supposed to be a cold night 🥶

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662303,"We all survived our first shelter night last night.  Met Buckeye Jim & Seeker.  With the extra time not needed to set up a tent, I rinsed out some clothes in the beautiful babbling brook on site.  Loved the site overall.  It was our coldest night yet at ~42*.  Definitely felt colder since the wind hit the open side of the shelter.  After a bit of experimenting on keeping my head & neck warm (wear hat, use sleeping bag hood, tie base layer around your neck), I was perfectly warm.
Today started with a 1000 ft breakfast climb before switching to pine & oak forests spotted with boulders to traverse.  Still we made what we thought was better time.  Our self talk said we are getting stronger.  In fact, we passed a lovely Chinese family yesterday & again today.  After greetings & exchange of destinations, she said to me:  you look better today.  Yesterday you look very very tired. Ok I’ll take it.  Grateful there are no mirrors.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662379,"The folks that take off the trail & shelters on the AT do an amazing job.  Last night at Quarry Gap was a good example in as much as it was one of the most scenic shelters we’ve seen.  It felt like a scenic Village out of the Hobbit.  We were the only hikers so we decided to try the shelter again.  So after getting the lay of the land: water re-supply, reorienting to the bear container, cooking dinner, it was only 6:30….. sadly too early for bed.  And the temps were dropping fast.   Michelle Shocked performed Arkansas Traveler for us & then even tho it was only 7:45, it was time to hunker down before sunset.  Good idea because it got into the low 30’s & all layers were needed.  3 Dog Night.
Today’s hike was an easy 10.2 miles to meet Nora, Robert, Suzanne, Bob & Scout at Anna Michener PTC Cabin.  Only passing one group of section hikers all day.  Nice to be ahead the “bubble.” (Although we did hear a report from a local of a 600 lb bear (not sure how they got him to stay on the scale!!), we have not had a sighting.  In fact, only one deer!!!So thanks for everyone coming to meet us.  The band’s getting back together!!!

We had considered a Nero day (close to zero mileage), thinking everyone would be slow to leave the cabin, but since all were efficient, and the weather was nice, we opted for a full day.  Relatively easy terrain so did fine even with a late start.  
Co-hiked for a long while with a group of Amish women out for an 18 mile day hike.  One in particular was dreaming of a thru hike for herself…. And judging by her enthusiasm, I bet she does it.
Arrived camp a bit pooped to an empty shelter but still put up the brand spanking new 1-person Big Agnes tent that Robert brought .  I think I passed inspection for the assembly.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662467,"We both got a good night's sleep. I laid down at 7pm to listen to my audiobook and was able to stay awake until sunset.  But as soon as the night sky lit up above the tree canopy with a million stars, I fell asleep and didn't get up until 6:45am.  At that point, as has become my custom, I stretch in ""child's pose"" so that I CAN stand up.  Even then, it's always a bit shaky initially.  But after coffee we broke down camp and headed out.  We had to stop immediately for water since the spring at the camp was dry and we were low.  It was already turning out to be a hot day and we knew we'd need it.  Plus today's a big day.  Meeting Robert & Scout in Boiling Springs to get a hotel, take showers and do laundry after 8 days!!  Wooo Hooo!
The first 6 miles were scenic and pretty flat & easy.  Then we hit the Rock Mazes.  A few bouldering sections, but mostly picking your way throw huge boulders, up and down the ridge top. We past the original mid-point of the AT at Center Point Knob. Then finally we descended back to the forest floor a few miles before popping out on bright green PA farmland.  It was a hot day so we hustled through the designated field paths before arriving at Boiling Springs.  We were greeted by groups of kids on rope swings jumping into the river and then Robert & Scout with a cold Coke.  Yippee!
But there was more.  After a small tour of Boiling Springs we headed to Allenberry resort for a 4:30 dinner.  As a special treat Laura & Steve came up from York to join us.  I'm sure we looked and smelled like dirt, but they were kind not to mention it. Dinner was delicious.  So far I seem to be finding a way to maintain my weight!!  Then off to a local hotel to shower & do laundry.  Very exciting.

And this was a good day to put in miles.  Except for the last mile, today’s path wandered us through fields of hay & patches of bluebells & stream crossing & numerous roads & back yards…..very flat.
And we almost beat the rain…. But not quite.  Good opportunity to test my “rain drill”, I.e. stop & quickly put on rain fly, change into rain jacket & pants & gators.  Good practice & Success in keeping me dry.
With thunder storms projected for the next 4-5 hours, we’ll be sharing the shelter with “Stick” & Smoking Bobby & Victor for the evening.  The privy is reportedly a “Taj Mahal”, so will be looking for a break in the downpour to experience its glory.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662592,"After 12 hours of hunkering down in our sleeping bags, all 5 shelter sleepers we’re up fairly early & ready to tackle the day.  (I enjoyed a new breakfast of dehydrated oat milk & Honey Nut Cheerios with my coffee.  Really delicious.) Today was going to be our longest yet.
We descended down from camp to a few miles of grasslands and flat woodland trail’s filled with blackberry bushes & blueberry bushes.  Couldn’t help but think that Mr. bear will be thru here once these are in bloom. Then we climbed pretty steadily up above the Cumberland valley & then to hawk rock affording all a panoramic view of the countryside.  What goes up…. We had a steep 800ft descent back down into the valley where we followed the river to the town of Duncannon where Steve bought some cook stove fuel and we stopped at the Doyle Hotel for lunch.  We were joined by “Stick” and “Lumberjack”.  Lumberjack got his name from an unfortunate bear bag incident on the Colorado Trail.  He started in Georgia in February and would have blown past us, but had to wait til tomorrow for the Post office to open so he could retrieve his new shoes. (His3rd pair).
Cultural note: our server wore a mask (only one in the bar who did) and a gun in a holster over his apron.  I made sure to tip.
After lunch we walked thru the rest of town then crossed the Susquehanna and Juniata Rivers and headed back up to the ridge.  This section was slow sledding & definitely where Rockslyvannia gets its name.  Nonetheless, we made camp with daylight to spare.  Stick & Steve took the small shelter & I’m using my tent.  First night that might freeze, so everyone is putting their water filters in their sleeping bags to keep them from freezing.  The northern lights may be in view tonight, but I’ll likely only see them in my dreams.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662641,"This morning we said goodbye to “Stick” as he got up early to put in a 17 mile day.  (It was early enough that The hoot owls were continuing their conversation from the night before; the sounds that had put me to sleep ). We planned to settle for 12 miles.  Our next shelter was 24 miles away & too far to tackle in one day.  So we elected to shoot for an unofficial tent site midway.  (noted on our navigation app FarOut)  The shelters offer a few amenities not available at tent sites such as a composting privy (all but 1 so far have been functional), a bear hang or box, often water nearby, sometimes a picnic table for cooking and of course the shelter for ….well shelter from rain & snow if needed or if you just don’t want to pitch your tent.  The tent sites are simply a flattish area of ground with sometimes a fire ring. I like the shelters when they can be found, but that won’t work today.  Tonight’s campsite is here:  Latitude: 40.455926 Longitude: -76.790427
The hike for the day was a long stretch of ridge line dividing two valleys. Aside from a trail runner we met before we even left camp, we didn’t see a sole all day.   The trail was rocky, but we’ve seen much worse, and relatively flat with a few undulating climbs.  I came to look forward to seeing the May apple plants (see photos) because it meant relatively flat and slightly more soil filled terrain.  Easier that on-edge rocks on the feet.  There were a half dozen or so large fallen trees to navigate , but no huge obstacles.  So why am I exhausted??  Not sure, but the Jane Fonda stair master workout we did at lunch to gather spring water may have something to do with it.  We Thought we were being smart.  Since water did not exist at our destination campsite, we saw a sign for a spring 5 miles before camp that said “Spring 300 Steps Away”.  That didn’t sound far…..  Holy gigantic steps, that was a workout.  But at least no water worries tonight. 
We stumbled into camp & set up tents quickly since it looked like rain.  And after an early Jambalaya dinner, we set out to put up our 1st Bear hangs. Interestingly we found the remains of a few abandoned efforts still hanging in a nearby tree as a good reminder of what NOT to do.  I got mine hung, albeit perhaps a bit low, [Steve’s looked regulation] and decided it was time to call it a day.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662730,"Coldish night(34), but we and our bear bags survived.  It is worth noting that there is skill involved in efficiently peeing& pooping in the woods.  It is not something I practiced….I’m sure my Catonsville neighbors are delighted to hear, but maybe I should have.  I do not have that skill yet.  All things in time.


Today’s hike was uneventful.  We passed thru multiple forests with mountain laurels and barely babbling brooks. We saw 2 other campers.  We were reminded that although we couldn’t see it, civilization was near by.  We could occasionally hear the traffic on interstate 81, we saw fighter jets flying overhead on maneuvers ( presumably from the local navy base near Phly) and we heard rapid fire machine guns.(hopefully from the navy base but more likely someone’s back yard..)


We made decent time because although the trail was still rocky, it was pretty flat.  The empty shelter had an attached water supply (yippee), but looked possibly inhabited by wildlife, so we chose a beautiful campsite out on a peninsula of sorts not too far from the shelter.  Only after setting up camp & building a small fire (Our first) did we deduce that this was probably a mound of discarded coal slag from mining operations of old.  (We did walk through a marked coal mining site from the 1800’s).

Robert shuttled us from Snowtree back to Trout Run/ PA433 where we had jumped off the trail two days before.  It hadn’t started raining yet but we knew it was coming & geared up.  Robert (trail name: Supply Chain) & Scout (trail name: Smiley) hiked a mile or so with us before heading back. Scout practically skipped up & down the trail, she was so happy.  Robert is trying ti regain some strength in his knee.  We passed some volunteers counting thru hikers & sharing snacks.  We’d just resupplied but Scout was happy to indulge. 
It started to rain steadily and as has become a pattern for many days, we started by quickly headed up to the top of the ridge (Blue Mountain)  definitely burning off my egg McMuffin.

We also walked thru a recent controlled burn area that felt like a cross between the wizard of oz’s yellow brick road & a scene out of Harry Potter.  Pretty eery.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663035,"It turned out that last night was a bit more exciting than I would’ve liked.  Shortly after finishing my journal entry, I checked the weather to see how much longer it was going to rain and hunkered down in my tent.  The radar had flood warnings.  The water began gathering outside my tent walls and on top of my ground cloth, so I worked for a while to make sure I could keep everything, especially my down sleeping bag & puffy from getting wet. My mattress pad is about 1.5 inches high & I was trying to balance everything on top.  But As the rain got heavier, I realized that in my haste to get my tent up, I had picked a poor spot.(catching allot of runoff). So, I pulled my rain gear back on, pulled up tent stakes and drug the tent to higher ground.  Better.  After a few hours the rain stopped but then the winds started roaring.  It sounded liked waves of jet turbines.  I heard tree limbs falling near the shelter & throughout the forest.

Amazingly it was sunny when we got there so we decided to stop and make breakfast & lay out our still wet clothes to dry out.  Plus a gorgeous view.  We did however look like the Beverly Hillbillies.  In fact a day hiker, Amy, approached rather tentatively because she thought she stumbled across a homeless camp.  Finally, with mostly dry stuff, we headed out for a long day.  We learned later that the area had gotten 5 inches of rain over the weekend.  Where does that water go??  We can tell you.  Most filled the trail so that we spent most of the day splashing along, even navigating downed tree to get across the deepest areas.  Steve’s shoes were completely drenched.  I had chosen today to try my waterproof socks & although they created some hot spots, my feet were dry.We chuckled when we saw Crazy Feet heading up the trail towards us mid-day.  He had been ahead of us but got turned around after an overlook.  If he hadn’t run into us, he might still be going the wrong way.We stopped briefly at Eckville shelter for a snack & bathroom before tackling the hardest part of the day.  Once we climbed Hawk Mountain we hit a brutal section of rocks that slowed us to a crawl.  And we got a few minutes of sleet & rain thrown in for good measure.We finally made it to camp & a new shelter in plenty of time to make dinner and crash.

One of the ridiculously speedy GA guys.  He graciously and quietly bunked down.  I kept thinking that I would not have wanted to be out on those rocks with a headlamp...but his timing was perfect.  Likewise, the next morning, Huskie and the other young guy were out quickly. They were planning a 25 mile day. They dressed quickly (packing barefoot even tho it was 38 degrees), had a cold dry breakfast and hit the trail at a quick pace.  Steve & I were still trying to warm our coffee and spinning in place.  And so we confirmed one of the best ways to increase your mileage.....start early.  In general, we have been averaging about 2 miles per hour but it varies greatly based on the terrain.  Flat woodlands can mean 3 miles/hour, but the notorious rocks can bring us to a crawling pace of 1 mile/hour.Aside from some early rain, the forecast for the day was mostly dry and we were planning our biggest mileage day yet, even though we didn't have any idea what the terrain was.  (The apps and guides show elevation but not how many rocks.....)  We were going to Outerbridge Shelter on the other end of the Lehigh valley to meet Robert & Scout for resupply.  There was a parking area .6 miles from the shelter and the plan was that after we camped together, we would resupply from the back of Robert's truck.As it turned out the day had a little bit of everything.  Relatively easy old roads for a while, then a section of tough small rocks, then a grouping of boulders and a lovely overlook...all along the ridge.  We saw one day hiker and another section hiker completing his thru-hike to Harpers Ferry.  But we heard about the ""Knife's Edge"" before we hit it.  The title is really pretty self explanatory.  Probably our most challenging bouldering yet before traversing the sharp ledge of a ~100 yards.  Forego the poles and hold on with hands.  All in all pretty fun.  By then we had deduced that the shelter we were shooting for was probably going to be full and did not have a camp site for Scout.  So we called and audible and asked Supply Chain to find a hotel for the night.The rest of the day was a similar variety of terrains until we hit the scenic ridge overlooking the entire Lehigh Valley.  Really stunning.  Plus I spent the rest of the day taking my mind off my aching feet by fantasizing about what I was going to have for dinner. :)A few hours later I was greeted by a very excited Scout.....Luckily she brought Robert with her.  Cracker Barrell for dinner.  Wooo Hooo!!Stats:  Elapsed Hiking Time:  8 hours 50 minutes.  Weather:  Overcast & cool (48).

Last night was pretty fun.  I like camping a little better than staying in a hotel, but they’re both pretty good.  Mom took a shower then laid down almost immediately.  I tried to share the bed as best I could.  She kept saying how much she loved dinner and how she ate everything green on the Cracker Barrel menu.  I think she’s kidding, but I’m not sure. Mr. Steve was nursing some blisters on his paws, so maybe Mom’s paws hurt too.  I do know she woke me up in the middle of the night.  It sounded like she was growling at a fox, but I didn’t smell one.  I asked Dad & he said that’s just what she does when she’s really tired.  That’s weird.


Today we went back to the trail at Palmerton.  We hiked with Mom & Mr. Steve for a little bit but then dad said it was time to turn back.  I didn’t want to but mom had shown me the pictures of the Knifes Edge Rocks and said the ones coming up soon were even steeper going about 1000ft straight up. (Lehigh Gap Rocks) Mom thought she would have to use all four paws to climb the rocks.  I said I could do it, but she reminded me that sometimes I get freaked out climbing indoor steps with open backs.  Fair point.  Dad said we were going to go do another hike before we went home & we’re going to be back in a few days and will do some more hiking then too.


Dad says that we have a really important job.  We are going to bring Mom food when she & Mr. Steve need it.  He said we’re in charge of their supply chain.  He said no army ever won a war without good logistics & supply chain.  I don’t have any idea what he’s talking about….. but that happens allot.  Anyway, it sounds important and I know he’ll need me to supervise.  He needs allot of help.  So I am proud to accept my new responsibilities.  I’m a team player.

We hiked up to the Kittatinny Mtn ridge. There were still rocks, but these were kinder & gentler than the PA rocks.  The trail narrowed to single file at the south end of Sunfish Pond, a glacial pond and National Natural Landmark. Tons of people were out to hike round & picnic at the beautiful lake ( no swimming, boating allowed).  We hiked back up on the ridge and saw the Poconos in the distance.  Grabbed water from the stream and made One final climb beyond the Mohican outdoor center( where we heard a black bear was spotted ) and back on the ridge in search of a campsite (no shelters near by) We reached our original target and found a gorgeous spot.  Sharing it with “Rooster” & “Swift”.

Picture Benny Hill slapstick sketch) I’m now lobbying for his trail name to be flipper😊.
The most notable milestones for the day were a series of ponds including 2 large beaver bogs/ponds.  We couldn’t find them but definitely saw the results of their labor.
The rest of this section gave us a few areas of rock climbing.  My favorite was where it appeared the trail went up a shear cliff, but in fact, it wove thru a series of switchbacks, unseen from the front….” The hidden climb”
Our shelter had recently been redone, but was still small & we both set up tents to hopefully avoid the bugs.  Speaking of bugs, I found my first tick & was luckily able to remove it before it dug in..

Starting at dusk, he belted out long anguished “songs”.  At one point we think he was on the picnic table along side the shelter.  He was unrelenting.  He would pause occasionally, only to launch again once I had just dozed off.  “Give it a break, Romeo!!,” I tried to reason with him. Chicks don’t want the guy to do ALL the talking.  He would not listen.  He finally stopped around 3am…. I assume he went horse.
Today’s hike was nice. Aside from some initial rocks, we were treated to long sections of serene, smooth forest floors and low lying bogs.  Early on we passed the highest point in NJ (1798’), also the surprise location of a Washington Monument style war memorial. Timing was perfect to detour a half mile or so into Unionville NY for lunch.  Pizza at Annabelle’s was recommended by a sage hiker.  This same sage hiker, hearing Steve’s camp chair story, christened him “Flipper” (trail name).  And so it shall be.

Anyway, Robert & Scout dropped us back off Seven Lakes drive & we headed out for a 15-17 mile day.  We didn’t know for sure because our maps conflicted and there was a purported detour around the busy Palisades Parkway,  so our exact route was TBD.  Both Steve & I were sporting our brand new shoes.  Unfortunately those fancy shoes didn’t have a directional sensor.  About 2 miles in we got off the trail on a side trail by accident.  No worries, check the app.    Looks like the trail is 100 yards “this” way.  So we bushwhacked through the forest rather than back track.  We found the white blaze & headed off again.  After 20 minutes or so we ran into “Swift”.  Good to see her….. but bad news, we had been hiking south (ie the wrong way) for about a mile.  #<#€?!#$&!!!!  I thought that rock looked familiar!!!!


Once back on track, we had a lovely climb up Black Mountain (Elevation 1400) & a traverse along the ridge top for a while.   We were able to clearly see the NYC skyline as well as the Hudson River.  


To avoid a major road crossing of the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Harriman State Park a section of the Appalachian Trail was supposedly closed , but the detour added a mile or two.  Given our earlier missteps, we decided to try to cross the Parkway and follow the original AT.  Luckily everyone was at brunch with their Mom and we didn’t have to wait too long for a gap in the traffic.


We followed the old trail….now unmarked….  mostly and met very friendly New Yorkers out for the day, along the way.  Finally we climbed up to the Bear Mountain summit (1407.9 ft) and started down a most amazing series of probably 1000 stone steps via switchback finally exiting into the very popular Bear Mountain recreation area next to Hessian Lake.  Of course we found hot dogs before entering the Trailside Zoo.  Strangely, the trail walks through this small adorable zoo for about a quarter mile.  So we can now say we saw a Bear on the AT.  😊.  As a helpful worker told us, the Zoo also holds the distinction of being the lowest elevation on the entire Appalachian Trail, at 160 feet above sea level.


Once we exited the zoo we crossed the Hudson River via the 100 year old Bear Mountain Bridge.  A bit of roadside walking and then up another 700 ft or so to our campsite.  Sharing it with “Stats” & “Swift”.  In the “only in NY” category:   As we were all setting up camp, several local hikers walked by.  One group caught our attention because in addition to their dog, they had a coati (a Mexican raccoon) on a leash.  Looked like a cross between a rat and an armadillo…..

Today’s hike was an active recovery day & I was grateful.  Relatively easy & not too long.  We climbed quickly & walked across the rocky, open summit of Shenandoah Mountain (elevation 1274) with a lovely view & a homemade 911 painted memorial. 


After traversing the floor of this upstate NY hardwood forest for a while we climbed back up to Cross a rocky ledge near the summit of Hosner Mountain.  Supposedly that is the Shawangunk Ridge and the Catskill Mountains visible in the distance.  


I say “we” but technically I hiked alone all day only running into 3 or 4 other hikers along the way.  Steve started behind me and also took a detour with Ed the marine to visit a deli on the way.  Robert met him and brought him replacement polls, but must have just missed me.  Go supply chain!! Steve & I met up at the Morgan Stewart shelter for the evening.  Locals had disabled the water well at the shelter saying the water was not suitable for drinking.  Steve pulled some water anyway but quickly threw it out.  Super minerally. 


I don’t know why I don’t have olives & biscuits & gravy for dinner more often….. really delicious.  And half a payday bar for dessert.  Yum.  


This will be an early night.  It’s cloudy but hoping there’s no rain coming out of those clouds.  Good night all. 💤

Today was a pleasant surprise.  Cold air kept the bugs at bay.  The 16.6 miles was in our wheelhouse especially since the ups & downs were gentle.  Still a workout, but not nearly as taxing.  


Passed dozens of serene streams before hitting the shoreline of Nuclear Lake. (Finally warming up enough to drop a layer).  Evidently the name comes from a plutonium research facility that was once located on the shores of the lake but was shut down in 1972 after a chemical explosion occurred. The area was tested and deemed safe but we won’t be drinking the water.


A few miles further & you can’t help but be impressed with The Dover Oak, the largest oak tree on the AT.  The tree is estimated at over 300 years old, and has a diameter of approximately six feet.


We had arranged to meet Robert for resupply & lunch at a food truck on Route 22.  After a long Swamp River Boardwalk walk we continued through wetlands for a bit.  The phragmites have even invaded here and are fighting the cattails & winning.  


We popped out of the marsh to be enthusiastically greeted by Scout at the Appalachian Trail train stop, which connects to New York City via the Harlem line.


As it turned out we had 2 food truck choices & went with Gyros.  Delish.  


After lunch with only 5 ish miles to go we first headed across active cow pastures.  I explained that I ate allot of chicken.  They seemed to approve.  


The last few miles of trail had not been cleared recently & required a bit of bushwhacking. But eventually we made it into the Wiley Shelter where Robert & Scout had already set up the tent on a platform.  Home sweet home.  Sharing the site with Atticus.  (Real name)

Due to a bridge washout in 2019, the trail crossed Dueul Hollow Brook via a Wobbly log bridge.  Scout initially swam across then came back to follow Steve across the bridge.  Ultimately she was encouraged to just swim across & she did.  Good girl!!


Reconnected the Robert on the Connecticut border.  Rumor has it that CT trails are better maintained than NY.  We’ll see. 


The rest of the morning was beautiful.  Streams and woodlands and crossing the spectacular Ten mile & housatonic rivers.  (Even saw a couple of Baltimore Orioles for good luck!)


Eventually the climbing began, as we knew it would.  Up Schaghticoke Mountain with views of the Housatonic River.  Across a few rocky ridges and then down to the Mt Algo shelter where we met Helium(forest mgmt lawyer) Lefty (firefighter) & Willy.

Toured a very secure dispensary called “the pass” in route. And drove through quintessential New England small towns in route.
Today’s hike was not only short but quite pleasant.  I had just started to question whether my hiking speed had really slowed.  But the morning confirmed that no, I hadn’t slowed down (although I am pretty slow).  The terrain has been getting harder and slowing down our average.  But today only had some moderate climbs and a walk beside train tracks and the river into town.  We made good time.  We did pass over the Lime Rock racetrack and heard the echoes of the race throughout the valley.
Also, in as much as we are about to leave Connecticut, I am officially giving CT the best trail signage award.  Somebody bought a sign kit and has put it to good use.  There were many signs, like this one showing Katahdin distance, in the middle of nowhere that made me smile.

So each time I got up, I went to the same spot on a slight slope, 12-15 feet away from the tent.  When I got up this am I was surprised to see a clear trail in the dirt from the top of the hill to just shy of my tent.  Hmmm.  Will rinse my ground cover just in case…..😊","Pine Swamp Shelter

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664207,"Today was a lovely zero day in Pittsboro/ Great Barrington celebrating Steve’s birthday.
Flashback:  As the prospect of our thru hike became increasingly real early this year, I found I had multiple fears/worries/concerns more or less in this order:
After telling pretty much everyone I knew, plus a few random people for good measure, that I was going to thru hike all ~2200 miles of the Appalachian Trail this year (my time honored way of committing to a big goal), my #1 fear was that I would give out physically in the first week.  How embarrassing!!My # 2 fear was Lyme disease And #3 concern was Incompatible expectations for the group.  Of course, in the beginning I assumed Robert, Scout & I would stay together, but if we got on Steve’s nerves or held him back in some way, or disagreed on pace or priorities, I assumed we could split off from Steve with no hard feelings.  No problem.  But when Robert got hurt early, the dynamic changed.  So now I wondered how compatible Steve & I would be hiking together???  


At it’s core, thru hiking is a solitary experience.  You are alone with nature & your thoughts for ~22 hours a day.  Even if you’re hiking at exactly the same pace as your companion (unlikely) and are a really chatty type, you learn quickly that you need to conserve your energy for climbing. It’s not a coincidence that most of the hikers we meet are hiking solo.  
But I’m delighted to say I worried for nothing.  It’s been a true joy to share this adventure with Steve.  He’s easy going and easy to collaborate with.  He is the source of infinite knowledge (some of it even true) & Dad jokes.  He’s not easily rattled in a pinch.  Just the type of person you want around at the end of a long day.  In short, a good soul. 


So to my partner in grime…..


Happy Birthday!  May you enjoy many happy trails in the years ahead.

(She didn’t)


Nonetheless, the morning trail was beautiful with only moderate climbs & we made good time.  We hiked over Mt. Prospect (1448 ft) and Lions Head peak (1714ft) before lunch break & decided to try to extend our range for the day beyond our original campsite target at Laurel Ridge.


Of course then the real climbing began and slowed our horses a bit.  We first went over the rocky summit of Bear MTn (2323 ft) which happens to be the highest peak in CT.  A giant cairn (a pile of rocks with a flat top) with a plaque notes the honor.  Nice panoramic views span the valley of Twin Lakes to the east, to the Taconic Range to the north, with a good view of the south slopes of Mounts Race and Everett. (Our next targets)


We then dropped down to Savages Ravine and walked alongside Sawmill Brook through a beautiful, old growth hemlock forest for a mile or so.  And then crossed over into Massachusetts.  (I was disappointed that CT didn’t use their sign kit for a monument to the occasion)


Once past the ravine, the real workout began.  1000 ft climb up to the Mt race ledges and ultimately Mt race (2361 ft)


From there we picked our way down some steep rocky descents to Race Brooks Falls campsite. Full day.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/664513,"After saying goodbye to all her camp mates, Scout was ready to walk Robert back to the car 2 miles away.  But surprise.  We had already planned to meet Robert & Scout in Dalton, 12 miles away, so Scout got to hike the full distance with me.  I was afraid we’d see allot of holiday hikers, but we only met one older woman on her own thru hike quest who loved dogs.  I was also concerned we’d meet a porcupine.  We’d seen scat and sightings in the area.   Scout’s honker of a nose would definitely hold allot of quills & I didn’t want to see that!!


But No danger encountered & Scout put her nose to the trail and never faltered [see photos]. She must have been able to smell the path because several times where I would have needed to check twice for a blaze, she didn’t hesitate.  Of course she continued to go ahead 50 yards & come back to check on me, so she undoubtedly did 24 miles in total.  The terrain wasn’t too tough but she got some plank walking, a few steep climbs & some rock hopping in. And of course stream sampling. She had a blast!  


Upon meeting up with Robert in Dalton however, she jumped in car, as if to say, “that was great, but I’d like to ride the rest of the way if it’s all the same to you.”😂


We had a hiker lunch at the Dalton Cafe complete with cake for dessert & set back out around 3pm.  The trail had been pretty easy, so we considered going beyond our planned camp at Crystal Mtn.  Added incentive was to leave fewer miles for Mt Greylock the following day, which will be our highest ascent yet.  So we mushed on and made it to the wonderful Father Tom camp in Chesire by 6:30.  Good decision ! The city had partnered with the local Catholic Church to build the space.  It had a grassy area for tents, poles for hammocks, a water well, portapotty, charging stations, picnic tables and bike to borrow.  They thought of everything.  I might become Catholic.


So a record distance for us, a great day for Scout (Robert reports she hasn’t moved in 6 hours)  and a fun opportunity to see 2 small Massachusetts towns.  A little hiker hobble is a small price to pay.

On paper, today’s hike looked tough: 3300ft up & 2000ft down.  The summit of Mt Greylock is the highest point in Massachusetts and the subject of poetry & prose.  But it didn’t turn out to be that bad.  The trail designers seemed to give a switchback or insert a flat for recovery at just the right time.  Robert & Scout had drove to the top of Mt Greylock to secure a parking spot for our cookout.  And then they hiked down a few miles to meet us on the way up.  


At the top was a lovely lodge built by the CCC., Civilian conservation corp, in the 30’s and a war memorial tower built around the same time.  (Nice way to commemorate Memorial Day).  This was the first day the lodge was open for the season & there were many visitors out & about.  Robert set up a cooktop behind the car & treated us to hotdogs, slaw, chips, pickles, and Cookies for dessert.  After a leisurely lunch we hiked the final 3.5 to WilburClearing shelter which was full for the holiday weekend.  We reconnected with Jolly Ranger & No English.


Speaking of No English…he has confirmed that PokeMom will be my trail name.  He’s from East Germany & there’s a chance he didn’t understand me, but he affirmed that it was a “great” name & I should keep it.  Done.


In light of Memorial Day, it was also interesting to hear “No English”’s view on why the Appalachian Trail. (He’s finishing up his last section to Maine). He explained in broken English & some charades that there is no equivalent in Europe that is so “free” in where you can camp without reservations, and where you can wander and without cost. Several other German hikers told us the same.  Interestingly, we’ve only met Germans.  No French.  No Italians.  No Brits.  After his AT hike, he plans to take Amtrak from Chicago to Seattle with his wife.  He was giddy about getting on a slow “ Cho-Cho”, unlike the speedy German trains.  That made me laugh.  But he was most excited about traveling in general.  Born in East Germany, he was not allowed by the Russians to travel until 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down.  He’s making up for lost time.

Today’s hike took us into the town of Greylock where we had been advised by the local trail runner to have breakfast at Renee’s Diner.  Unfortunately it was a little further off the trail than he said and added 1 mile to our day, but we ate with Jolly Rancher & all had the hungry man’s breakfast of eggs, toast, bacon & pancakes & several coffees.  It turned out I would need those calories….


The trail out of town walked thru someone’s back yard and then paralleled a beautiful stream for a while before the climbing really began.  Nothing today was technically difficult, but there was allot of it.  Over 4000ft ascent and over 4000ft descent!!!  That’s more elevation change than a Grand Canyon rim to rim hike and it was warm so I was dripping with sweat for most of the day.  So I’m calling today our “salty rim to rim” day and will have a margarita at some point to commemorate it.

Look up.


We had a full day today so retiring early to rest is not a bad thing.  We met Robert & Scout at a crossroads 2 miles in for bagels to fuel up.  Robert was even able to give “Oz” a lift into Manchester for his resupply after giving us our next 2 days of supplies.  



The climbs today were moderate…. But there we lots of them:-Bromley Mtn ski resort @ 3273 ft had the best views of the day.  I think we came up a green ski trail.  The ski patrol shack was open to use as a shelter, but we had to move on.  


-After a 800 ft descent , Trail magic was waiting with gallons of water just when I needed it!   The next 10 miles were dry and on a hot day it was nice to have to reserve.


Next came Styles Peak @ 3375, which was the highest but the views were obstructed by trees.Then Peru Peak and finally Baker Peak @ 2771 ft.  Surprisingly this was the most work as you had to shimmy up a long rock face.Finally another 800 ft descent down to the valley and the trail to big branch river.  The last section had lots of what we thought were Moose scat.  But no moose sightings. 




Amazingly this is day 50 and we have covered approximately 650 miles!!  I think I have even surprised myself.  Grateful for & transformed by the journey so far…..and curious & excited about the challenges ahead.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665009,"Yesterdays rain brought a dramatic change in temperature. Overnight, it dropped to the low 40s, and it was still cool as we headed out for the day with soggy packs.  Only two items on the agenda for the day:   1)hike up and over Mount Killington of the ski resort fame (elevation 3898) and 2) to make it back down in time to hit the Irish pub @ the iconic Inn @ Long Trail. 


We achieved!  But Killington reminded us that it was time to put gloves & maybe some other cold weather gear back in the pack…. Well, perhaps Steve doesn’t have to.   😊….  
Backstory: the climb up Killington was cold & windy & a good workout.  Normally, I only wear 1 layer, because the exertion will keep me warm without sweating.  But at ~40 degrees, I couldn’t work hard enough to stay warm & had to add a layer.  Up ahead of me, Steve was doing the same.  But neither of us had gloves.  My fingers were going numb and so were his.


A half mile or so from the top, the trail was abruptly blocked by downed trees.  Although I was behind him, we both concluded separately after exploring that there was no way around.  We both had to take off our packs to get under.  Steve cut his leg scrambling under the down tree. When I finally approached the top (20 minutes behind Steve), two women yelled, “Are you PokeMom?? Mr.  Blue went down to Cooper lodge. We gave him some gloves“  So Steve had told them the story of his injury & cold hands & the women donated their gloves to the cause.😊. Trail Magic. 


But we succeeded in conquering Killington!! AND it was too cold for the black flies!! (I’ve been calling the little buggers gnats. But I just learned from a fellow hiker that these are indeed the famed “black flies of Vermont.”  Yes, they’re black & yes they fly. But I was looking for something more akin to the standard house fly. Wrong.  These be they.  Robert met us just off Route 4 and shuttled us to the Inn.  (Scout was evidently very concerned when she saw Steve approach from the trail but not me. Where’s Mom?? She cried & whimpered until Robert came with her to find me. It’s nice to know someone’s watching over you!). We were treated to a night of Guinness & Irish whiskey.  Sleeping in tomorrow.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665053,"Steve & Robert closed down the Irish pub last night and the Inn offered a lovely breakfast at 7:30, so we were slow getting started today.  Robert &Scout were headed to Gifford Woods campground to car camp.  We geared up for 4800 ft up & 4400 ft down day.  


We had just gotten started when a hiker engaged us to tell us about his harrowing day the day before on Mt. Moosalaukie.  He had video to share.  Our ascent is more than a week away but a good reminder to make sure to check weather before heading out.  I’d also take his comments with a small grain of sand.  There are 3 things this long distance hiking community likes to talk about (& it’s great!).  1) where you started & where you’re going.  2) your gear.  When someone asks what type of tent is that?  “A red one”, is not an appropriate answer.  Model numbers are expected. 3) the toughest obstacle you’ve faced.  Great stories & learning opportunity.  This was one of those.


The rest of the day was an exercise in long climbs & false peaks.  In fact, I think I need a commemorative drink for this type of section as well:  “The False Peak”. Basically a half & half (Bass Ale & Guinness) stratified with a Baileys foam infusion layer on top.   3 flavors to fake you out, hopefully finishing with the sweet.  Yep, I have to think about something to help get thru long climbs.


Although I really appreciated whoever gave us a ladder to get down off a rock outcropping, the highlight of the day was probably the ending.  We planned to stay at a cabin called “The Lookout “.  It’s private & not an official AT shelter, but the owners graciously allow thru hikers to stay when they’re not using it.  Fully enclosed with a widows watch on top with a spectacular 360 degree view of the area.  Van Gogh girl joined us & sketched the view.  Pretty good huh?

Today’s hike was another “False Peak”.  Similar to yesterday with long climbs & descents. (3800 ft up/ 4400 ft down) , but we added some scenic mountain meadows full of wildflowers, blackberry bushes, and views of working farms.  


Made it to Thistle Hill shelter to camp without mishap.  Well I guess Steve & Van Gogh girl both had small mishaps when they ran head first into a downed tree.  Knocked VG down & both saw stars.  I’m surprised I missed it.  So easy to do when you’re looking down…

Don’t surprise a bear:  Too late.  That ship has sailed.  As Momma bear crossed the trail, her 2 adorable cub scampered ahead up the tree. I surprised her & she surprised me.  But She just lumbered forward, kept her eye on me and started snorting.Make yourself big:  This crossed my mind but I already had on my orange rain jacket & neon rain fly over my pack.  I was pretty big.Make allot of noise:  This seemed like a bad idea.  She already knew I was there.  I didn’t want to startle her.  Plus, while still snorting at me she started climbing the tree and following her cubs.  I figured the live & let live strategy might work…..unless snorting means you’re gonna charge….but I think that’s just bulls..Don’t run.  Don’t play dead:  I took a quick picture and switched to video, but initially forgot to push record because I was very busy having a staring contest with Momma & trying to see if she was continuing up the tree or turning towards me.. I was thinking that I should stand my ground & with both poles I could fight her off if need be.Slowly move away:   Under normal circumstances it probably would have made sense to back away…but I needed to go forward past her tree.  By channeling my inner bear, I eventually concluded that she was more concerned about her babies than me and was not coming down.  So I slowly moved down the trail.  She was above me now and I listened carefully for any sound she was charging towards me.  If yes, poles. Don’t make eye contact:  (I think this is actually for gorillas, but I wasn’t taking chances). So, I looked down as I walked past her tree.  Plus, if I looked up, I’d probably trip…..bad.  After a slow 50 feet…..I jogged away heart pounding.


Sooooo Exciting!!!  I did want to see a bear this trip.  Mission accomplished.  This was actually a pretty close encounter and timing is everything.  Steve was a few hundred yards ahead of me and never saw anything.  Glad Scout wasn’t with me.  Next time, a bit further away would be fine..

By most accounts, one of the most difficult sections of the Appalachian Trail is the White Mountains of New Hampshire.   Today we dove in…. Will be hiker hobbling tomorrow.


First ascent was Mount Moosilauke.  We’d heard that it was pretty tough so we had only planned 7 miles for the day to orient ourselves & see what to expect.  In addition, we left super early to try to avoid afternoon thunderstorms.  But After only 2.5 hours of going “up” on a relatively manageable trail, we came out above the tree line.  It was overcast, but still the views from the summit were awesome.  Ironically, this was probably the easiest part of our day.


Since we made it to the first shelter by 10:30, and the weather was supposed to turn tomorrow, we decided to try to push on an additional 9 miles to Eliza Brook.  


We made it, but it took 8.5 more hours.  First, the very slippery & steep descent alongside Brook falls.  Falls is definitely the right word.  Even picking each step at a painfully slow pace, I fell twice &  Steve fell 5 times .  No major damage though. 


Then the up & down trek for the rest of the day was taxing.  Lots of mud, black flies,  boulders, downed trees, and slick rock slabs to navigate.  Our pace in the whites is now 1.25 miles/ hour.   But the good news is we are staying at an AMC hut tomorrow night, and this will allow us to make sure we get there in time for dinner!!


This was likely the most work we’ve done on any single day.  Whew!  Lots of Vitamin I for dinner.

Rains came at 4am. Knowing we had only 6 miles, we slept in a bit.  Still had to pack up in the rain as dryly as possible.  Those 6 miles took 6 hours and the first half was definitely the most grueling climb yet.  As we talked to others later, they all agreed it was daunting.  I used 4 new maneuvers for the first time during this exhausting morning:
The intentional butt slide. Useful for getting down slick rocks when the distance to the landing zone is daunting.  Plus just like those 5 year old skiers….if inevitable, not very far to fall.The tree swing.  Holding on to a tree beside a rock slab & using it to swing myself up to a higher ledge.  Judging from how smooth the trees were, this was used allot by more people than just me.The pull up.  Not my strong suit.  But there was allot of bouldering today & sometimes the only way up was to grab a handhold & propel myself up onto the next level.  (Sometimes combined with a double pole push from behind)The belly flop.  Similar to the pull-up, but instead of pulling, I launched myself up with my legs but stayed low to the rock to avoid loosing my balance.


The rain cleared around noon, but the trail was very wet. Several areas where the platform bridges were underwater.  Eventually you figure you can’t get wetter & just splash through.  Unfortunately everything was socked in with clouds at the top.  No views.  A nice 20-25 mph wind on the top to blow dry us. 


Luckily,  the way down wasn’t quite as treacherous.  Only a few spots where I had to use my new techniques.  And for all our hard work, we were cheerfully greeted at the beautiful Lonesome Lake Hut.  This is the first of 4 AMC huts across the White Mountains where I plan to stay and this one is a real treat.  Coed bunk houses.  Running water.  No electricity or showers but, Dinner & breakfast included.  And even though you are strongly encouraged to have a reservation (we did), it’s early in the season & only 3 hikers are here.  I have a bunk room all to myself!!  Luxury.  


The “Croo” prepared a delicious meal of minestrone soup, salad, bread, (I thought that was it and ate a bunch), plus deconstructed tacos and chocolate chip brownies. And we all ate together.  Fun to be with these young people.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665503,"After a delicious breakfast prepared by Croo, I was anxious to get going on our big day.  At first we had a dubious start (.5 mile in the wrong direction), but then things turned around.  We met Supply Chain & Smiley briefly for a resupply and headed up Falling Waters trail towards the famous Franconia ridge.  The Mt Washington weather forecast was not encouraging…. Afternoon thunderstorms with possible hail and total cloud cover.


But by the time we hit Little Haystack Mountain, the first on the ridge, there was a little bit of sunshine and we were treated to a series of beautiful vistas.  First, Mount Lincoln then Lafayette.  Mount Lafayette is the highest peak in the White Mountains outside of the Presidential Range.  Then we descended back down & up again to Mount Garfield.  


It was a full, but manageable climb.  When you looked for footholds or handholds, they were there.  And considering it’s a very popular trail, it was well maintained.  The Kinsman climb was much more grueling.


Our tent site had a caretaker and was pretty full with several familiar hikers.  Just as we set up our tents we got the forecasted heavy rains for just a bit.  Will sleep well tonight.  An even bigger day tomorrow.

I was initially worried about being able to complete the mileage we planned today before sunset, so we started early.  Luckily these are the longest days of the year and it's not uncommon to see hikers up and out by 5 am.  With wet tents to pack up the best we could do was 6:30.  We needed to do better than 1mile/hour to make it to camp in time.  Not a given.  


The start did not help my average. We descended down into the clouds and hiked out on a steep flowing water fall for a half mile or so before starting to climb again toward the peaks.  Most of the peaks were socked in with cloud cover so unfortunately not many views except on Guyot where I briefly glimpsed the surrounding mountains.  The climbs were tough on the knees & toes but not that difficult and I started to relax when I realized I should be able to make camp before dark.  Luckily the last 4 miles, though very muddy, were flat and allowed for a comfortable arrival.  The Ethan Pond campsite, like Garfield ridge charged a fee and had a caretaker.  When I asked the caretaker Solitare about swimming in the lake she said, “yes of course, although now it’s still a bit cool” And as an afterthought, “Oh and there are leaches.  They don’t do much damage though…”.  Ahhhh, that’s a big no.

Today’s hike was one of my favorites so far.  The first ascent to the views before Mt Webster was steep but on a well maintained trail.  Webster Cliffs was a steep but fun rock scramble with plenty of hand & foot holds. The rock climbs to Mt Webster & then Mt Jackson had a mix of rocky trail, exposed  rock slabs and scrambles.  I met Cynthia from Quebec on Mt Webster & we hiked together to Mt Jackson.


Beyond Jackson was more mud & alpine bogs.  One slip and my previously only dirty shoes were covered above my ankles in muck.  This is definitely the dirtiest segment yet!!

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665614,"Today is bittersweet for several reasons. 
Due to inclement weather on top of Mount Washington (heavy rain, no visibility, 40 degrees with 60 mph wind gusts, hypothermia conditions), we regrettably decided that this was not the day to hike the very technically difficult 11.8 miles across the Presidential Range to Madison Spring Hut.  Not only would it be very challenging and potentially dangerous, we decided that we would rather try it at a different time when we would be able to worry less about the conditions and enjoy the views.  After today, Robert was planning to pull me off the trail to head back to Baltimore for a west coast family wedding and some “home duties” anyway, so we accelerated our schedule by 1 day, hiked (swam) the 2.7 miles down the Crawford Notch Trail to the AMC Highlands Center to meet Supply Chain & Smiley and pulled off for a zero in North Conway today.

Tomorrow, Mr. Blue and I will go our separate ways for a while.  He will continue on to Mount Katahdin.

With that change, we decided to get the band back together.  What’s more, with Maine still under water, we came up with a plan B.  We’re going SOBO from Harper’s Ferry for a few weeks before heading back to Maine in late July  & finishing our NOBO section. (3-4 weeks left to Katahdin)


Today’s reintroduction to hiking class 101 was good.  Both of us are still hobbling a bit, and nursing sore knees, even after 12 days of rest & recovery, so we were planning a pretty tame day. Supply Chain & Smiley drove us out to Harper’s Ferry (after a donut stop of course….) and we headed south along the West Virginia / Virginia border with a hazy sun shining on the Shenandoah.  Two big changes became immediately obvious from what we had been experiencing up north.
Many more NOBO thru hikers on the trail.  I think this is part of the bubble trickling thru.  We chatted with a few but if we had stopped to talk to everyone, we’d still be out there.  There were dozens and dozens, most having started in GA.  Nonetheless, we seemed to make good time, even stopping at the Blackburn Center (1 mile detour) for water & a complementary cold soda!!!  Another water spring stop yielded that cold spring water I missed and a bee sting for Steve whose pack was near a bee hive in a downed tree……The trail itself was a bit easier with peaceful sections of clear dirt paths mixed with rocky climbs. We had just entered the “roller coaster” section of Virginia where the heat was turning up a bit when we stopped for the night at Bear Den Hostel (4 miles beyond our original plan inspired by a hiker tip (thanks Intrepid) but SO worth it) 


The Bear's Den Hostel is now owned by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, but was originally a family second home and has all the amenities.  For $20 we got to camp in the yard, shower, a pint of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, pancakes for bfst, a soda & a free beer.  Bargain!!  Between the indoor bunks & the outdoor campers probably a dozen people here tonight.

I woke up at 6, packed up the tent then headed up to the main house for coffee & griddle your own pancakes.  [I am not doing a good job at eating the 5 days of food I’m shlepping around but hot pancakes hit the spot] We planned less miles for today because we were hitting the infamous “roller coaster“ section. Actually we’d already completed 3 peaks, but had 9 to go.  After a slight misdirection (Steve has to maintain his Mr. blue credentials), we started down from a peak.  And it was just as the name implies:  500 feet up, 500 feet down on continuous switchbacks all day.  No real views at the top.  A few nice streams at the bottom.  Compared to where we’ve been, today was not difficult, nor technically challenging……but it WAS a 7 hour workout in high humidity.    I drank 5 or 6 liters of water & never had to pee.  I did drip with sweat for most of the day.  


So when we made it to a stealth camp we’d selected beside a babbling Brook at 3:30. (Usually too early to stop) I decided my aching knee & angry toenail would enjoy a break & we made camp for the night.  Steve was easy to convince.
In the plus column, we’re really enjoying the lack of bugs.  There’s a few of course, but nothing like the terrorizing version in NH / Maine.  VA AT promoters need to add that to the brochure.


Early dinner.  Early bear hang (I’m practicing doing my own). And early to lay down at possible new record time of 5:15.  Will enjoy my new book.

I met a large black snake that I swear had a bright blue head, but I didn’t get a good picture to confirm.  My family research department thinks it’s an Eastern Indigo.  A few rabbits & birds also visited.


Although the cloud cover kept the heat down a bit, my biggest obstacle for the day was still the heat/humidity as I’m trying to build back up my strength.  So I was happy to stop after only 8 hours at a shelter that everyone seemed to love/ recommend.  And I can see why.  Adirondack chairs.  Nice shelter & cooking area.  Solar shower.  Not sure there was any “solar “ in my shower, but it did feel good to at least rinse off.  “Invigorating” is the word.  Not clean, but definitely less dirty.  


We’re bunking in the shelter since it’s supposed to rain all night.  So far only young folks briefly stopping to use the shower or cook dinner before moving on for more miles.  One guy planning to do the 4 state challenge:  touching 4 states (Va, WV, Md & Pa) in 24 hours (~43 miles??). Oh to have young knees again….

Today turned out to be a record distance [22.2 AT miles plus 1 to camp] 9 miles into our day we entered the Shenandoah National Park and the backcountry permit station.  (Before that  a cold Pepsi as trail magic.  Yeah) We originally planned 18.5 miles to Gravel Springs Hut and would have planned a bit further, since the terrain & trail maintenance is so wonderful, but didn’t see any options on our maps.  However Mr. Blue spoke to a local hiker who recommended a stealth site just 3.2 miles further.  Given we weren’t impressed with the hut and it was reported to have a resident rat, we decided to try to find the stealth site.  


We finally reached Hogback overlook after several 3000 foot climbs but could not locate the stealth site.  As luck would have it there was a car camping campsite ~1 mile off the trail.  We hobbled down the mountain to it and fortunately they had space for us.  Whew.  Otherwise I would have had to lay down in the street. (No ice cream or showers tho)


Good night all.  Putting tender paws to bed.
Note to self:  we walked past a VERY large government compound near Front Royal. The buildings in the distance were 1970’s vintage but the fencing & security system was new.  In 3 miles we walked past gate 75 & 76😳.  What is this??  Update: Bob said it is a massive Smithsonian complex that includes animals…..???

Today was an 11 mile Nero with a pick up from our good friend Bob to spend the 4th of July at his & wife Jeanne’s beautiful home in Reva Virginia.  Bob started hiking with us 70 days ago, so it’s a fitting holiday reunion.  As a double bonus, we all (including Robert & Nora who drove over from Balt) got to meet Cassie, their adorable 11 week yellow lab.  So far Scout has not shown any nurturing instincts, but Cassie is undeterred.


It’s always motivating to hike towards a Zero, but I’m particularly enjoying the Shenandoah trails. The smooth footfalls make it feel like you’re “cruising” even when sweating the climbs.  Not a coincidence that we saw dozens of trail runners out this morning.  It’s the perfect spot.  We’ll probably be updating our goals going forward as a result.


Hiked with some Boy Scouts for a while (thinking about “The Goal” by Goldratt the whole time.). Also passed a family of 11? With kids of all ages carrying full packs as big as they were.  Inspiring.


We also experienced our first Skyline drive “Wayside”.  These convenience stores are stocked with food for resupply and sometimes even a sit down restaurant.  Evidently There are 3 or 4 more in Shenandoah park to look forward to as we crisscross Skyline drive and will reduce our need to carry as much food.  Winner.

These will be my 3rd set of Hoka Trail Runners in ~900 trail miles, plus ~100 miles of pre hikes so it feels like 500 miles per pair is going to be what is needed.


Today was a bluebird of a day. Since we knew we’d have a late start, we didn’t plan a big day.  That also gave the luxury to take a few side trails to lookouts and stop at a real restaurant (Skyland Resort) for lunch.  Very civilized.  We hiked over Mary’s Rock (3453 ft), The Pinnacle (3694), and Stony Man Mountain ( 3972), plus numerous cliffs with wonderful views. (See pics). And for once the weather cooperated. Carolina blue skies and last night’s thunderstorms had knocked to humidity down a bit, so not super hot.  


And still made it to our hilly campsite by 4.  
Shared camp with Pack mule, Sticks, pokey.  They had already completed their full AT in sections and were back for more.  Headed NOBO.  Nice.


I did have some Equipment challenges.  My tent frame popped when I was setting up camp.  I was afraid it was broken but with the help of pack mule I was able to repair it.  (Lots of flies here for some reason, so tent protection definitely preferred). Hoping it was just loose and is still good.  Pack mule said he’s heard of lots of big Agnes tents having the same problem after a few years….so fingers crossed.  Then when I laid down I sadly discovered that my air mattress had a slow leak.  Amazingly I was able to find the leak without the soapy water routine and use my repair kit to patch it.  Will soon find out if that was the only culprit.  Fingers & taped up toes crossed.  So far so good.

We enjoyed a big breakfast at the Big Meadows Lodge restaurant & a snack stop at Lewis mountain campground store and that fueled me nicely for the day including over the highest peak for the day: Hazel top mountain (3804 ft)


After a full day on the trail, We were able to find the stealth campsite we were looking for this time and were able to set up our tents before the forecasted rains hit. Glad because I might could have made it another 3.5 miles to the next shelter….I didn’t particularly want to. 😊

Today was rain forest steamy and included a bit more climbing than the “cruising “ terrain we’d been enjoying.   Our 4800 ft of ascents & 4000 ft descents definitely qualifies for a Salty Rim to Rim cocktail.  The route crossed over Hightop Mtn 3542 ft,

Today’s hike was a little cooler and slightly less difficult but largely uneventful.  My feet still protested a small bit but I think it’s just the mileage.  I pretty much hiked thru without a break.  It was largely interior trails that wove back & forth across skyline drive and down for each of the gaps between mountains.  Doyle’s River Overlook and Black rock were the most interesting milestones.


One last climb up Calf Mountain to our selected destination campsite.  There were only a handful of tenting sites so Mr Blue & I both set up in one.  Shortly thereafter 3 more hikers and then the entire Boy Scout troop from Ohio we had passed earlier pulled in.  We’re now packed to the gills.  Should be a fun night.

Supply Chain & smiley dropped us back at Rockfish Gap to continue south into the George Washington national forest & they headed home.  They’ll be back to get us in 5 days.


The first half of the day was easy & delightful. Smooth trail with gradual climbing switchbacks all the way to Humpback Mountain. We even passed the Mayo homestead. Bob, your folks??? I had brought 2 liters of water but surprisingly after the very dry Shenandoah, there seemed to be springs & streams everywhere.  The only downside was that there were not that many overlooks.


The afternoon brought steeper climbs & rockier terrain, but also overlooks to Wintergreen ski resort & the Waynesboro valley and another punch on my Appalachian trail wildlife bingo card. A northbound hiker had warned us to be on the lookout for a timber rattler. And sure enough I saw my first one.  I heard him before I saw him.  He was slightly off the trail sunning himself after what looked like a big meal.  If this was the same one we’d been told about, he hadn’t moved in quite a while.  I hugged the opposite side of the trail and inched by.  He raised his head but didn’t attempt to strike.  Kinda cool to see.


Nice campsite at Maupin Field. Reconnected with “No Rush”.  Also 4 kids camping by the stream.

Oh, what a difference a day makes. Today really was a lovely Yellow Brick Rd hike.  Maybe we’re not done with cruising after all!!  An easy climb brought us up to the summit of Cole Mountain (3971 ft) and a lovely series of ridge views and mountain meadows filled with butterflies & unobstructed views to both the east & the west.  I even got to look back upon the Priest one last time.


And since it must be snake week, I also saw a huge copperhead cross the trail in front of me.  Growing up in North Carolina, copperheads were always the enemy.  I always wondered if I would recognize one when I saw one.  Well the answer is yes.  No doubt on this big boy (3ft). The picture’s not great, and in person he was much “oranger”…..but still counts on the bingo card.


Then a long steady descent off Bald Knob (4045 ft) all the way to Brown Mountain Creek.  We followed the creek for several miles.  Evidently this creek was home to a community of freed slaves in the late 1800’s.    I can see why.


Just as I approached the Lynchburg reservoir, the thunder really started to roll, the skies turned dark, the air temperature immediately dropped 15 degrees and the downpour began.  The trail was almost immediately a river.  Of course by the time I got to our target stealth site, everything was soaked.  I quickly partially set up the tent , just enough to be able to get out of the rain and hunkered down to wait for it to stop.  At a small slow down, I finished assembling the tent underneath.  Changing into dry clothes & calling it a night.


I lost Steve.  He was ahead of me as always, but wasn’t at the stealth site when I got there.  I’m betting he either couldn’t find the site or just decided to hike on the the next shelter since he was already drenched.  Not a bad idea.  Unfortunately, with no cell service, I’ll have to wait til tomorrow to know for sure.

Truth.


My shoes were still soaked so it felt like the perfect time to see if I could hike in my sandals and waterproof socks.  I packed up & set out to hopefully find Steve.


I first met a young girl hiking with a cat (I didn’t actually see the cat.  Learned that from the next hiker “zero”). I asked them both if they had seen Mr. Blue.  No luck. I wasn’t too worried because I assumed we’d just meet up at the next shelter.  But soon afterwards I heard, “PokeMom!!” And saw Mr. Blue hiking up behind me.  He hadn’t found our stealth site and had picked another close by.  He had set a sign for me but in the downpour I missed it.  All’s well.


In muggy air, we started climbing.  We crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway at Punchbowl Mountain Overlook and continued up to the peak of Bluff Mountain (3351ft) and the remains of an old fire tower. Nice view.


After a few more roller coasters I crossed the summit of Little Rocky Row (2424).  The ledges gave a glimpse of the James River Valley, Thunder Ridge and Apple Orchard Mountain where we planned to head next. 


For the next few hours we made our way down to the James River.  Expecting more rain tonight (permanent forecast for afternoon thunderstorms at 4pm),  Steve had stopped at a large creek to take a bath & dry some clothes.  As we plotted our last few miles to the shelter we saw for the first time that our target shelter was closed due to bear activity.  Evidently there’s a 10 mile section that has had a fair number of “encounters “.  Plan B:  call a shuttle to take us to Stanimals hostel in Glasgow.  Burgers at the only restaurant in town & bunking with 9 of my new best friends ( see pic for Ash & Kindheart (60 lb pack!!!) while the thunderstorms rolled through again.  Supply Chain will retrieve us tomorrow.

I woke up pretty sore this morning after the Carter mountain range, so I was glad that, although today was just as long, it looked like it was going to be a little less daunting.  Although there were certainly mountains to climb, there was some road walking towards Gorham and peak to peak flat sections of the trail today to allow some active recovery.  Of course, there were also long sections of alpine bogs, where all my energy was spent trying to find a non muddy,  gooey step.  I’ve heard of hikers falling in up to their waist. Nope.


Starting seeing moose scat and thought I smelled them, but no sightings.


My favorite part of the day was trying fresh blueberries. At the top of a section of steep, rocky slabs on the Mahoosuc Trail I joined Taco & Easy Rider ??.  They pointed out the tiny berries & I enjoyed a few.  Several of the open slabs today also had great views south over Mt Hayes to the Carter-Moriah Range, southwest to Gorham and the Presidential Range, and southeast to the Androscoggin River Valley.


Mid morning it started to rain and continued on & off for most of the day.  A large cloud passed through and turned the trail dark & foggy.  Felt like sunset even though it was only 2pm.


Finally arrived Gentian pond Shelter.  This shelter had a beautiful view but since Taco’s tramaly of 9 was already there(Mandalorian, Harvard Law, others) ( they volunteered that there was plenty of room for me…), I picked a tent platform instead.  Looks like more rain tonight.

As a result, The climbing today was pretty slow.  In addition to the up and down, I was carefully trying to avoid submerging in the bogs.  I passed 2 hikers who had slipped in up to their thighs.  I almost made it too. But at mile 8 of 10, I slipped off a boardwalk (at least I think that’s what happened.  In the blink of an eye, I was in muck up to my knee.) and was baptized in Maine mud.  Welcome to Maine.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667243,"Known as the ""hardest (and most fun) mile on the AT, the Mahoosuc Notch was on my mind and motivated me to break camp by 6:15am while the ""Tramaly"" was still snoozing.  By 7:45 I had climbed over the summit of Fulling Mill Mtn and was entering the Notch.  I'd heard it was a field of boulders and knew there was a ""squeeze"" where you had to take off you pack to get through.  But beyond that, I was excited to see what it was like.  True to the advertising, the Notch is a deranged jumble of boulders at the bottom of a deep cleft between Fulling Mill and Mahoosuc Mountain.  The game for me was strategically picking a line (then deciding that was the wrong way & retreating) and then boulder hopping and rock climbing and in my case butt sliding down sheer cliffs at a very slow pace. As as reward, I sampled the delicious, ice cold water spring at the bottom.  It took me 2 hours and 15 minutes to go one mile.  I mostly traveled on all fours, using the momentum of my pack to get up on higher ledges, but occasionally I used my poles.  One tense moment as I dropped and watched my pole tumble down and pause on a cliff.  I was able to retrieve it, but with 1 more bounce it was a goner.  Final review:  95% fun and 5% scary.
With all my focus on the Notch, I had not noticed that the rest of my day had some exciting and extremely tough climbs.  The Mahoosuc Arm was a grueling 1500 climb in less than a mile.  And after a small break traversing rocky slabs and ledges, I climbed down to Speck Pond and crossed it on a log bridge thoughtfully created by our beaver friends.  Not done yet.  It turns out I still had Maine's 3rd highest mountain next.  With the name ""Old Speck"", who would have guessed that the 4157 ft peak would have been extremely steep endless exposed rock faces.  The good news:  amazing views and I definitely preferred going up vs. down. 
After that a gradual descent down to the Grafton Notch Trailhead to meet Supply Chain, Mr. Blue and of course Smiley.  A sight for exhausted eyes.  A very tasty dinner at Sunday River Brewery and off to Gorham and to bed.  A zero for me tomorrow.

I quickly got above the tree line and was treated to beautiful 360 degree views for several hours.  Perhaps because I had just come from the Mahoosuc range, and it was a short day, it felt pretty easy.  Since I had extra time, I also took the loop to the Mt Eisenhower. Still I arrived at the hut by 1:30.  Mr. Blue had come from Nauman campsite and arrived even earlier and went on to Mt Washington and back.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667398,"Oh what a difference a day makes weather wise on Mt Washington.  After a brilliant thunder and lightning storm last night at Lake of the Clouds I woke up this morning to be surrounded by fog.  As we climbed up to the nearby Mt Washington summit (6293 ft) it was difficult to see the next cairn (used to mark the trail ).  Easy enough to envision how people get lost in bad weather.  But we made it and took the commemorative, no view, summit picture and wandered thru The visitors center.  


Originally, I was going to stay at one more hut only 7 miles out (Madison), but decided that given the weather forecast for tomorrow (Tornado warning) and our desire to make better time, I’d stay with Mr. Blue & push the 14.9 miles to Pinkham Notch.  


So for 12 hours we rock hopped down the 6600 ft to the valley by cairn.  Mount Madison (5347 ft) was impressive and a slightly technical climb.  Just beyond the summit the path got steep and a bit confusing & we “rock-whacked “ across a boulder field to get back on track after somehow loosing the trail.  Luckily, by noon,  the winds had cleared our views a bit so we could see the cairns if we could only decide which one to head to.


Supply Chain had arranged to pick us up at Pinkham @ 7, but With our slow pace it was going to be tight.  Adding insult to injury, just beyond Osgood tentsite, we took the wrong trail (grumbling & blaming the signage) and that added a few miles to the journey.  So when we reached the Mt Washington auto toll road with light starting to fade, we decided to detour down it for the last 2miles.  And happy day.  One of the last cars coming down was a pickup truck. We hitched a ride (my first successful hitch) in the back to the relief of our knees & ankles who had had a full day.


A stop at Good Day Brewery & an evening watching US v. Netherlands made everything better.  Back to Maine in the am (Grafton Notch) for our final 267 mile push north.

 We chose a leisurely start to our day.  Resupplied our food and went for breakfast at the Gorham bookstore & coffeehouse.  Supply Chain & Smiley drove us back to Grafton notch.  As expected, just as we headed out it started to rain.  Smiley jumped back in the car & looked at me like, “you’re crazy. It’s raining out there” 


And rain it did for the next 9 hours.  After winding through the forest for a bit, We hiked over both Baldpate peaks.  The first one gentle sloping schist (just learned the metamorphic rock I had been calling granite (in the granite state, no less) is actually schist. ). The second peak a bit steeper.  But both completely exposed. The views would probably have been wonderful if I’d been able to see more than 30 ft in the fog/cloud cover.  The trail on the open slab was well marked with cairns, but I could only see one at a time.  Plus stiff winds (25 knots), rain and fogged up glasses made the ascent of the East peak invigorating.


With more heavy weather pending, we chose to stop at Frye Notch shelter to try to dry out.  Spent a pleasant afternoon sardined in the 6 person shelter with 3 20 something young men.  2 Pine Island Adventure Camp counselors & one thru hiker (who also started on April 14th……in Springer- Tailwind) listening to the rain on the tin roof.  7 campers from Pine the camp tented nearby.

Except for a challenging climb up Moody Mtn(2379 ft) at the end on the day, today’s hike was a bit easier & uneventful…… for me.  But Mr. Blue had some excitement.  As he rounded a corner and came alongside the water at Surplus Pond he heard a splash.  He looked up to see a large moose only 20 feet away.  Mr Blue was able to watch the moose for a few moments before it left the shore and swam/ walked across the lake and exited the other side.  We assume it was a male with his big rack.  One more check on the AT wildlife bingo; although I'd love to see one too!!  (Picture pending from Steve).  Of course we've know they're around.  I've seen moose tracks as well as lots of moose poop....some still steaming with warmth!


My only excitement was of the less fortunate kind.  While retrieving water from Black Brook, (which we ford 1st thing in the am), I dropped my water bottle and helplessly watched it float away since I didn’t have on my water shoes or my poles to pursue it and the current was too swift to tackle without shoes & poles.  By the time I retrieved them, it was long gone.  Will make do with my Katydin filter bottle until resupply.

With 17 Maine miles to go today, I headed out early & pushed hard all day.  It was the 1st time we would be fording rivers & I knew that would add time to the already slow Maine terrain.

Last night’s rain brought cold temperatures (low 50’s ?) and it felt like fall this am.  I broke camp a little later than normal figuring a little time for Mr Blue to catch up.  We were supposed to meet Supply Chain for a resupply this afternoon and I was curious to see where Mr. Blue was.  Once I got to the top of the 1st ridge I checked for texts and the picture became clear.  Mr. Blue had been attacked by a cedar tree and thrown to the ground.  He was fine but he broke his pack frame.  He took an hour or so to repair it and by the time he got to our “bail” campsite it was getting dark and starting to rain so he wisely decided to stay there. This am he broke camp early like I thought he would & we met on the trail on the way to see Supply Chain & Smiley.


The reunion was as glorious as always and Supply Chain treated us to a truck trunk buffet of deli sandwiches, fruit and chips. As other hikers passed, trail magic was shared with one & all.  Luckily we had plenty to share.  One hungry hiker walked up and politely asked, ""is this where we get trail magic?""


After stuffing ourselves, we headed to the gorgeous Eddy Pond where we stealth camped on the shores of the pond. There was a row boat and canoe on the shore, but no-one quite had the energy to take them out. I did however had a nice spot to wash the caked mud off my legs.  Saw a loon and am keeping eyes peeled for moose.  Shared the site with Sean and 2 more who came in late, I.e. after I laid down at 7.😊

Today’s highlight was definitely Saddleback Mtn, The Horn, and Saddleback Junior. The three peaks, 4122, 4017 and 3597 ft respectfully were all above the tree line and had amazing 360 degree views when not covered in clouds.  The hike up was thankfully dry and gave you the sensation of walking on the moon…..albeit a moon with well maintained direction signs & cairns.  The Maine woods are spectacularly beautiful. 


Around noon it started raining and kept it up for several hours.  Silver lining was I was able to ford rivers without changing shoes (they’re wet anyway). By the time I made it to our shelter choice for the evening, blue skies were peaking out again.  Full shelter with 10+ through hikers. I pitched a tent, made dinner & some hot coffee and was a tad anti social.  In an attempt to ward off the chill, I layered on all my clothes and cuddled up in my tent to finish my book.  Didn't get up until midnight to pee and got a peak at a beautiful moon through dense pines.  It’s going to be our coldest night in a while.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667614,"It's always a little easier to get motivated in the morning when you know you're headed toward a zero.  This morning I woke with the sun and it was cold.  I know one sure fire way to warm up, so I got moving.  The shelter was nestled down in dense forest, so it became increasingly lighter and lighter as I made the 1st climb to the 4000 ft Spaulding Mtn.  I never tire of seeing the streaks of sunlight break through the forest.   I passed the plaque commemorating the completion of the last leg of the AT by the Civilian Conservation Corp in 1932.
The descent down Spaulding was steep and had some ""heroics"" (Mr. Blue has coined this term to refer to when real acrobatics are required).  One 15 foot slab where I had to boot scoot down caught my attention.  By now, I used to dropping down and sliding on my butt if it's too steep, but beyond the trail width at the bottom of this slab was a cliff.  Need to make sure the brakes are working.  Success.  Whew.
A few open boulder fields revealed lovely mountain views.  We're close to the Canadian border now.  It would be nice if they put a large ""C"" on the mountains so I could tell which ones. :)
Next came Crocker (4037 ft) and North Crocker (4213) mountains.  At Crocker, I did a Mr. Blue imitation.  I was making decent time until then.  With my head down pushing up to the peak of Crocker, I completely missed the ""AT turn right here"" sign and continued up to the summit.  That wouldn't have been so bad.  Talked to some hikers having lunch on the peak and they pointed out that the peak was a spur.  So I headed back and saw a side trail and took it.  It wasn't as well maintained as much of what we'd been on, but sometimes that happens.  After 10 minutes more I was becoming suspicious, so I checked FarOut app and sure enough it said I was off trail.  No problem.  Head back to where you're sure the trail was.  But after 5 minutes back I saw a geolocator AT stamp on the trail.  Hmmmm.  FarOut still said I was off, but these stamps are official right??  Wrong.  This stamp must have been from a previous version of the trail or a service trail.  Unfortunately, I wandered around for another 30 minutes on these side trails before concluding I needed to go back to the summit and start over.  %$^#@&&%*
Met ""Snickers"" who was supporting her thru hiker husband by scouting trails and handing out snickers bars to thru hikers.  She said she was a nutritionist and that Snickers were the best for hikers.....Now you know.

While we we were enjoying our zero day R&R and mudslides, 3.5 inches of rain hit the area.  So this morning as we left Shaw’s and headed to the trailhead we heard that the detours we had been introduced to by Wendy were advised.  We soon learned why.  


The trail itself was a mud puddle and our first very small stream crossing required water shoes and extreme caution. I even experienced vertigo watching the water rushing underneath the crossing plank.


The 2nd & 3rd crossings were also creating an adrenaline rush. I noticed that most of the kids that passed me were not even trying to keep their feet dry.  Just plow through.


As I approached Little Wilson Falls and the suggested detour route, I saw a happy dog running towards me.  Surprise!  Supply Chain & Smiley had hiked out the trail to the falls to meet us.  And I heard from them that a kid had attempted to ford the river @ Little Wilson and told Supply Chain he almost drowned!!! It turned out that the kid was “whistles” (we knew him) and he had not heard the high water warnings or possible detour. (The normal 300 Cfm for little Wilson river was running at 1000 cfm) The current had knocked him off his feet and stripped his pack off of him.  Luckily, he was holding onto a guide rope and was able to pull himself back to shore and retrieve his pack.   Yicks!!


Our detour involved a long road walk, and Supply chain offered to drive us instead.  Yes!!  We delivered some trail magic (sodas, Gatorade, candy, chips) to soggy hikers along the way.  And with the assistance, we were able to make it all the way over Barren Mountain (2638 ft) and to Cloud Pond Shelter.  We shared the campsite with half a dozen thru hikers on their way to Katahdin including Danny Boy, Slim Pickings, Ricola,  Lucky.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668063,"Delayed Post.  No cell service in camp.A sleepless night for me since somehow I popped my sleeping pad again.  All I can figure is that something on my pack is puncturing it.  It was a cold night so every hour I blew it back up to stay off the cold ground.  Will plan to have Shaw’s deliver a new one when I get my resupply.


The first half of the day was mud, mud and more mud. I played leapfrog with the thru hikers from the night before. This can be trying. I can only imagine what it must feel like to only have 6 or so days left on your thru hike.  This group had started in Georgia on March 3.  As we slugged out, I heard one slide (but no thump of a fall) then a yell out,  “I hate this F$$$ing, diarrhea, mud, trail!!! I want to go home!!”  Ahhh, the sweet satisfaction of a completed goal and a job well done. 😊


But our day improved.  First I hiked past a plane wreckage. Supposedly, a father & son were flying to resupply their cabin in northern Maine & got disoriented in fog & slammed into Chairback Mountain.  Miraculously, they both survived & hiked out….


Next, after covering the Chairback peaks, we descended to theWest branch of the Pleasant River.  At the crossing were some trail magic.  I happily scored a Mountain Dew and pop tarts!!   The river ford itself was wide but easy and only thigh deep.  Nonetheless we took all precautions of water shoes, unbuckling our packs & putting phones in dry bags.  


The final push to Carl Newhall shelter was scenic and filled with day hikers. Mr Blue is loaning me his sitting pad and I’m sleeping in the shelter where the floor should be warmer.  Sharing the shelter with Seaweed( did 35 miles today) and the site with Toothless (finishing his last section), Slick.

Last night the skies opened up around midnight.  On the tin roof of the shelter it sounded torrential.  But after waking & making sure my belongings were under cover, I easily fell back asleep.  With Mr. Blue’s pad, I was stiff this am, but slept well.  


We planned 19 miles today so I left camp at 6:30 hoping I could make it in 12 hours (it actually only took 10.5).  First stops were over the 4 peaks of the Whitecap range. Steep climbs were made easier by well maintained rock steps in places.  I’d been told that was the last spot for cell service, so confirmed an earlier food drop.  The trail was wet from last night’s rain and it took a while for the morning fog to blow off.


Saw A fair number of both NOBO & SOBO hikers.  I even ran into “Kind Heart” and “Legless” from Stannimals hostel in Va.  (with a message for me on the upcoming river ford??). Wild.


The East Branch of the Pleasant River was a tricky ford.  Rain had turned up the turbulents, so I proceeded VERY slowly, finding each foothold with my pole before moving.  The last 15 feet were deep & strong currents.  My poles rattled.  One step brought water to my hip.  Luckily the next step was higher and then I was out.  I heard “good job” above the roar of the rapids from the group queued up to go behind me.


The last 3rd of the day was pleasant & easy.   Made it to Cooper Brook Falls shelter earlier than expected.  Sharing the shelter with Kermit, Kodiak, TDS (tropical dr Suess) , ???.  Steve camping with the guys from wilderness night 1.  Woke up twice during the night to complete darkness.  Could not see my hand.  It happens often but it strikes me every time.  We’re so used to ambient light.  My shelter mate even commented, “ yea I thought I’d had a stroke.  I can’t see!! Then I lit up my watch….”

With a little time to kill before our resupply (& sleeping pad replacement!!) rendezvous with Shaws, I cooked breakfast & made coffee & chatted with shelter mates who were in no particular hurry either.  (Also thinking I’m carrying too much food & need to eat it before adding more to my pack.). 


The trail was easy on the way to the drop location & I got there early . At times the path was just a glorious bed of pine needles.  A soft, spongy Highway.  No mud. No rocks. No roots.  Of course, not all the time, but fun while it lasted.  


I joined the group that was waiting for the 11am drop.  It came a little early and we each got our bucket of food, a cold PBR, and I got my new sleeping pad.  We gave them our trash and we & they were off.


With the flatter “highway” trail, we picked a further camp destination by Nahmakanta stream.  We may be able to get the Katahdin a day early.  We’ll see.  



Three river fords today. One required water shoes, but for the others I was able to find a spot to get across dryly.
Still a lot of mud bogs & with bogs come black flies & mosquitos, so once I made camp I was anxious to get my tent up, cook some dinner & turn in early to hide from them.  Speaking of hiding, Mr. Blue almost got some food stolen by a crafty chipmunk who jumped in his pack while he was setting up his tent!! Lots of people camping with us.  Some look local, but did meet “roadrunner” & “scrubs” who are also flip flopping.

When you come across complete silence on the trail, it’s noteworthy.  It doesn’t happen as often as you might think.  I can only remember a couple of instances to date where the silence of the mountain was deafening.  Today had a couple of those moments.  Usually the spell would be broken by a plane flying overhead (there’s allot) or a gust of wind thru the trees, or getting close enough to hear a brook or stream or cascade ( they like that name better than waterfall, it seems). 


For a brief moment I got one bar on my phone at the top of Nesuntabunt mountain & was able to call Supply Chain & let him know we would be one day early.  The 100 mile wilderness has been different than I expected.  The trail is similar, but probably easier, than the rest of Maine, and there are plenty of access points for day hikers.  The biggest difference is really just the distance without towns or amenities.  Still a very nice area to hike and ragged, smelly thru hikers are blasting past us on their sprint to be done.  We heard that 284 thru hikers had summited so far…..less than in previous years.


Current plan is camp tonight at Rainbow Lean To, then camp at Abol Springs tomorrow night, then hike the final section of the trail to Katahdin Springs, where Supply chain will pick us up.  A zero in the town of Millinocket before the big finale on Katahdin on Thursday (the day Supply Chain has a day/parking pass)

The best part of today was the ending.
Today was a pleasant but buggy & muddy hike past gorgeous ponds and iconic streams to Abol Bridge Campground where we met Animal, Bami, Vitamin D. ( two nurses & an appliance tech) After purchasing all the alcohol and sweets the camp store had to offer , we bought ABV’s open campsite for $20 each and spent the evening together gazing at Katahdin & chatting.  Oh, we have a picnic table!!! 


And I bought a $1 washcloth and took a divine hot shower.  Put on my last clean clothes .  ahhhhh.  Breakfast tomorrow at 7:30, which seems crazy late and heavenly.  Goodnight.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668068,"The Abol Bridge Campground was essentially empty last night.  Which is weird since you can't sign up for a spot if you tried.  This is often the second to last stop on the way to summit Mount Katahdin.  But according to Ranger Don, the record amount of rain and mud and bugs has discouraged hikers and campers alike, causing them to abandon their reservations.   Likewise after all of the angst over getting one of the coveted 12 camp spots at The Birches, there were only our 3 friends (Bambi, Vitamin D and Animal) in line at the kiosk (1 mile away) at 7 am to sign up.  They then had time to come back to the campground for the provided hot breakfast.  No hiker turns that down!!  Baxter is beautiful, but has allot of inconvenient rules.  It's possible they keep them on purpose.
The hike to Katahdin campground was cruising and we made it in record time. I would have said it was lovely, but the crazy amount of mosquitos kept me busy swatting rather than enjoying the scenery.   Supply chain had made the 45 minute trip to get us. [He & Smiley had spent the last week exploring northern Maine including Bangor, Acadia, St. Croix Island and Katahdin Woods National site, but Smiley is not allowed in Baxter] We gave Gonzo (who had just completed his thru hike) a ride into town.  He described the climb as harder than he expected, but fun.  We wait in nervous anticipation.
After cleaning up at the hotel, we went to get Smiley who was testing out the kennel where she'll be staying while we're hiking on Thursday.  Suffice it to say, she doesn't like it.  One super sad face met us at the door, before converting to a ecstatic jumping bean when she realized she was leaving.  Such a drama queen. :)
So our plan ""C"" is underway.  Kill a zero day in Millinocket before our summit on Thursday and keep fingers crossed for good weather....or at least not bad.  As I say, nervous anticipation.  
Not many dining options in Millinocket, but very cool Blue Ox bar was reminiscent of the booming paper mill days and then the Scootic In restaurant for dinner.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668135,"Well today was the big day.  Smiley was at doggy daycare and the rest of the 3 of us were sitting in line to get into Baxter State Park at 6:00am.  The forecast was overcast and dry, but we already saw sprinkles on the windshield.  In spite of his bad knees, Supply Chain really wanted to summit with us so the game plan was for me to stay with Supply Chain as we went up the Hunt Trail and down Abol Trail.  If Mr. Blue finished ahead of us (likely), he would bring the car from Katahdin Springs to Abol and save us a 2 mile road walk.  
The first part of the trail up was pleasant.  As we emerged above the tree line, the fog was thick and causing my glasses to completely fog up, making it somewhat difficult to see.  We had a very brief moment of sunshine, then the skies turned darker.  The climb up the Hunt trail was challenging but fun.  Filled with steep boulders and a few slides and iron rungs, we packed away the poles and used our hands to navigate the terrain and pull us up.  After 4.5 hours of climbing, Supply Chain & I made the summit and got our picture taken with the iconic sign.  It was exciting to share the final steps with so many pumped thru hikers.  Some had worn special costumes and others had family & friends hiking these last few miles with them.  Jubilation in spite of the sucky weather.  We didn't see Steve and guessed that he must have gone out on the Knife's Edge,  Since the wind was brisk and a cold rain was now coming down steadily, Supply Chain & I headed back down.  (It turned out that Mr. Blue was there and we just could not see him with the fog) Mr. Blue caught us at the Abol trail cut off and we gave him the car keys.  
The trip down Abol Trail probably was easier but was also a total slog.  Steep butt slides on slick and gritty boulders and scree fields.  The Abol trail had been recently rerouted and it was still a bit rough.  However, we finally made it down in 4 hours to find Mr. Blue and the car with a spare tire beside it sitting in the parking lot.  It turned out that he had slit a tire on a recently re-graded road on his way to get us.  A friendly park ranger had helped change and fill the donut tire.  So we were extremely lucky that she was there to help.  We were able to limp back to Millinocket to break Smiley out of prison, find an auto repair shop for the morning and get some dinner.
Supply Chain will need a few Vitamin I's.  Everyone else should sleep well.  The northbound portion of our journey is now complete!!

There were two things we immediately noticed today. One was that sun rise was much later than it had been in Maine.  (6:30 sunrise here/ 45 min earlier in Maine) Not sure how my circadian rhythm sleep schedule will have to be modified.😬  And the trail going SOBO in Virginia is not very crowded.  (Saw 3 people all day & have the shelter tonight to ourselves.)


Supply Chain dropped us off at the massive foot bridge crossing the James River. At nearly 1000 feet long, the bridge is the longest foot bridge on the AT.  The trail was pleasantly smooth with mostly packed dirt, so even though we had a 6000 ft climb & 3600 ft descent today, it didn’t feel that tough.  We had no trouble quickly moving past the 10 miles that had been restricted due to bear attacks.  Then again, having said it wasn’t that tough, we went almost 20 miles and my feet were hurting a bit pulling into camp and I had managed to create a new huge blister, which was surprising after 1400 miles…..  Probably operator error due to new shoe inserts.


Along the way, we walked past the Thunder Ridge Overlook, a quite impressive stone observation platform looking out to the northwest.  Then passed under the Guillotine, a very interesting formation with a hanging rock over a rock crevice.  I think it’s misnamed though.  Should have gone with “Mom, I’m stuck”.


But most of the day was spent continually climbing up to Apple Orchard Mountain (4203ft) , near a weather radar station and at the southern border of Thunder Ridge Wilderness. The path down was gentle and faster.  We noted that many of the springs were surprisingly dry.  We’ll have to be smart about finding water.


Good 1st day back. Were welcomed back south by the roar of the cicadas tonight.  Georgia, here we come!!

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668345,"I started out today a little gimpy.  My blistered foot throbbed.  But my spirits improved when I realized that today’s hike profile was almost the inverse of yesterday (4200 up: 5300 Down) and my feet didn’t hurt as much on the downhill. In fact I found the downhill slope perfect for making really good speed…… until click, boom I fell hitting the ground in front of me hard.  A quick inventory check confirmed I was fine…and lucky.  Falling forward is scary since you know the momentum of your pack will add to the injuries.  Good news:  I got my hands out in time to break my fall.  And I still have my front teeth!!.  Bad news: there’s gonna be a few marks on my forearms & hands. 


I now know I’m in stage 3 of reflex decline. You remember: stage 1:  young with catlike reflexes that prevent you from falling.  Stage 2: adaptable with time to react, roll and minimize damage. Stage3:  some reaction before your head slams into the ground stage 4:  no response.  Front teeth lost.  We met hikers in stage 4 & it’s haunted me.  I’m just glad I’m not there yet.


The rest of the day was spent weaving around the Blue Ridge Parkway and searching for water.  where FarOut would say we should see a gushing brook, we say nothing. It’s amazingly dry.


Delighted to find the spring at Bobblet Shelter was flowing…just barely.  Relief.  We shared the shelter with “Easy”, from Maine/ Japan. (Saw Supply Chain when he picked up our poles at Stanimsls ! ). Mr. Blue’s sleeping pad popped so he’ll be in the shelter w/ Easy, and I’m in my tent, staring at the stars and listening the deafening sound of the southern forest at night….saving the bucket of  Vitamin I for the am.

As soon as the rain stopped, the broiler came on.  Hot & sunny for the rest of the day.  Feet ached, but the trail was pretty easy.  We crossed under I-81 and into Dalesville where we needed to resupply & find Mr. Blue a sleeping pad replacement.  The last little bit of highway walking to our Motel 6 (the hostel I planned on turned out to be 20 miles away.  Nope.) was a bit dicey so I asked a volunteer firefighter to give me a ride & thankfully he did.  He said he was very familiar with the AT since he had to rescue people frequently.  He went on to comment, that it was section hikers, not thru hikers.  It was usually because they were not prepared with enough water or for the weather.  He also noted that the volume had been light this year.


We Uber’d to a hiking gear store where Mr. Blue had success finding a replacement sleeping pad, then to Kroger to buy WAY too much food , and finally to 3 Little Pigs for delicious NC bbq.

(Will have to research the circumstances). The memorial was touching & I paid my respects, but it’s got to be hard for anyone to visit since it’s miles from anywhere……but clearly they do.  The memorial was well maintained.


Water was still very scarce but there was more than yesterday.  We used a stream by a farm field and a stream by a road to refill.  Normally Both would’ve not been ideal due to runoff, but thirsty beggars can’t be choosy.  FarOut said we would have water at our campsite (I was hoping since I could really use a rinse & a way to cool down my heat rash legs). but the stream was bone dry.  Luckily we cross a major river in the morning & should be good.  This has been the first time the data on FarOut has been completely unreliable.  Just shows how dry it it.

Of other note. We crossed over the Eastern Continental Divide.  Waters on the west side of Sinking Creek Mountain flow into the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico, while the east side flows into the James River and Atlantic Ocean. And while not scientifically conclusive, my pee chose to go the ocean, not the Gulf of Mexico.  So there’s that.

We left camp and started out from the Pine Swamp shelter (ironically not swampy or piney) weaving our way through rhododendron groves to start the day.  A 1000 ft climb to Kelly Knob (didn’t stop to inspect it) and on up to the Ridgeline took several hours.  And like yesterday, the traverse along the ridge through a dying tree canopy that was filled with high weeds & briars.  Bushwhacking for several more hours required.  My arms look like I got in a fight with a litter of kittens.  (I did learn from yesterday & put on my rain pants for protection from the thorns and Probably could have put on the jacket, but chose to be cooler before bloody). It was also hard to see the very rocky trail, so that really slowed us down a bit.


No views to speak of, unless you took a side trail.  I’m sure they were lovely, but Nope.


Water was still scarce but luckily our chosen shelter (pine swamp) crossed Stoney creek .5 miles before camp & gave us a welcome chance to fill up.

Although it wasn't raining, I donned my rain pants & jacket thinking I would use them to protect me from the thorns.  But after 15 minutes of climbing the first ridge, I was drenched & had to take off the jacket.  I would wait until the brush got bad.  And for the first 4 hours I didn’t need the armor.  Up Peter’s Mountain and across the meadows of Sym’s gap on the West Virginia border was a pleasant hike.  Then the trail disappeared under 8 foot brush for the next two hours.  Jacket on and plowed through.  Probably put some holes in my pants & jacket, but no blood was shed.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668596,"The first half of today’s hike may have been the most pleasant we’ve had. Pretty flat on a trail through towering hardwoods, laurels and fields .  Even had water sources, had we needed them, but I loaded up before leaving camp, so I wouldn’t need any until later.  We made such good time we decided to reward ourselves with a side trip to Trent’s Grocery.(.5 mile off trail) Worth it. Hamburger, hot dog, Fritos, an Orange Crush & a Gatorade.  Sat beside a group of 70-80 something locals & this was clearly their gathering spot.  Actually reminded me of my grandparents.  Lots of talk of crops, neighbors, the sawmill across the street and of course, the “good ole days”.  They were there when we arrived & there when we left.  No need to rush.  


The 2nd half of the day had a little more climb, but was still pretty nice.  Had to go off trail to a stream that only had a few pools to gather final water for the night.  


Passed a family out hunting squirrels, 30 yards from the trail, including a 5 or 6 year old little girl who waved happily.  Her dad, grandfather & uncle were all in camouflage; she had on a pink dress.😊


Finally reached our ridge top campsite @ mile 599(that’s how many miles we have left to get to Springer Mtn, GA.). Lots of mentions of bears in the area so the bear hang went up high after dinner.  Was worried about water, but will have plenty.  Will sleep soundly.

Mr. Blue was making such great time he decided to go a bit further, but 19.5 was enough for me and I hunkered down at Jenkins shelter. Shared shelter with Mongoose from Omaha (BH).

I used my headlamp to pack up and get a 7 am start. Harder to do now that Sunrise is getting later & later.  


Today reintroduced some notable mountain climbs ( 5000 ft ascents & 4700 ft descents). Over Garden Mountain up to Chestnut Knob, which was the highest at 4400 ft.  From there you could see Burke's Garden, a very fascinating geological formation. I had been hiking on the rim all morning. The valley to the north, which looks like a giant, 8 mile by 4 mile crater from above, was formed by a limestone sinkhole. The valley has only one natural outlet, in the north, and only two roads leading out of it. 


At VA 623 crossing I saw my 1st trail magic in a while in the form of dozens of gallons of drinking water.  Also chatted with some locals who were going out “Bear Running”. I learned later that Labor Day is the start of “running” season.  You can’t kill the bears until December., but now these hunters & their dogs just track & try to tree the bears.  I hope they don’t piss them off too much…..


After Chestnut Knob, I joined forces with “Big Pack Jack” and we plowed through several miles of open fields and brush on the way down. A few nice views.


Met quit a few hikers today, long distance & section.  And one family birthday party!  Helped mix things up a bit.  The locals had good advice on which streams had agricultural runoff & which were clean.  Good to know.


Mr. Blue continued to forge ahead of me and I suspect he is feeling the pull to sprint to the finish line.  Shared shelter with Big Pack Jack (who I had hiked & talked with earlier.  Separated when he stopped for water)

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668712,"Another nice, albeit a little warm hiking day.  Over mountain ridges then down several Hilly cow pastures.  Make sure to watch out for the cow patties!  Luckily I still had enough water to get me through the day, because although the streams I crossed were scenic, pulling water from a cow farm is not the best idea.  The AT continued alongside several Creeks in dense rhododendrons before popping out near I-81.  I had arranged to meet Supply chain & Smiley so we could stay together at the Long Neck Lair Alpaca Farm.  Smiley was very disappointed that she couldn’t play with the alpacas or the dozens of chickens & roosters in the yard. (Guessing we won’t need an alarm clock)


Mr. Blue was now 10 or so miles ahead of me but shuttled back for dinner (Wooden Pickle in Marion) and the opportunity to stay with the alpacas.  He plans to put the pedal to the metal from here on out, so this will most likely be the last opportunity for the “Band” to be together.  Godspeed.  I’ll be chasing you.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668816,"Delayed Post.  No cell service.It was a lovely day to begin the last 25% of my AT adventure as a solo hiker.  Supply Chain dropped me back at the trailhead off Route 11.  (Will see him again in Damascus.) Had to wait for a train to pass before heading up to several mountain pastures and across Rocky Hollow Road next to an old 1854 schoolhouse and the Settlers Museum.  I ran into Big Pack Jack a bit later & learned that he had stayed in the schoolhouse last night.  He said the old wooden desks creaked during the night.  Creepy.


Even though I didn’t need water, I passed quite a few babbling brooks during the 1st 10 miles.  Nice to see & hear, even tho the sound always makes me have to pee. 


Stopped briefly at the Mt Rogers National Recreation Area headquarters which included a bookstore and visitors' center.  


I found a good rhythm in the morning that made the 4000 ft climb speed by as my mind dropped into that meditative place where random thoughts roam free.  I treated myself in the afternoon to listening to my audiobook.  May keep that pattern on stretches like this one where I’m not too worried about having enough battery.


Went up and over Brushy Mountain and down to Trimpi Shelter.  With reported bear activity, it was nice that this shelter had the first bear box I’d seen in a while.


Shared the old stone shelter with Bulldog (tenting.  Trying to finish SOBO after injury), and 2 women section hikers from Florida on their 1st day out.  (Organized Chaos & Journey walker (friend of Vickie Halsey). And Big pack Jack showed up 2.5 hours after I did to tent.  The interior fireplace gave everything a campfire smell but otherwise is was comfortable.

I wasn’t expecting rain overnight, but around 2am, the heavy rains came, thoughtfully ending by 7am as I headed out.  More & more my headlamp is needed to pack up.


Once again the trail was lovely and I floated along at a nice clip stopping to talk with section hikers Baker & M&m from Australia as well as others.  I think the morning hiking is my favorite part of the day.  All the greenery is dripping with rain or dew and the morning sun is trying valiantly to burst through the tree canopy.  The overnight rain also filled the creeks & you could hear the gurgling from 100 yards away.  I thought more than once that I was probably carrying too much water. now that it was more abundant.  May cut back tomorrow.


The 3rd of 3 climbs went over Pine Mountain @ 5000 ft where I got my first peak of the Grayson Highland wild ponies from afar.  Just beyond was The Scales, a large horse corral in an open meadow west of Stone Mountain. (This is where the ole farmers weighed & sold their cattle before driving the herd to market.)


As I crossed over into the beautiful highlands pastures, the thunderstorms that had threatened all afternoon erupted in rain & heavy winds.  Completely exposed on the highland pastures I picked up my pace and was able to make the shelter in record time, albeit soaked.  I quickly changed into warm dry clothes and made a warm Shepard’s pie dinner to warm my insides.  Shelter to myself as of 6:45.

It feels like we're close to the end of this magical odyssey even though there's ~485 miles to go.  I don't want my mind to leap too much to the end.  I'm here to enjoy the journey.  Today was the perfect day to do that.
I had miscalculated the rains last night and left my soaked clothes out on a line to dry only to have them drenched again with more overnight rains.  But I stuffed them in a wet bag to mold, donned my waterproof socks and headed out at 1st light.  Today I hoped to see some wild ponies up close!
The morning hike up to Mount Rogers was glorious.  Panoramic views of mountains peeping out above a blanket of white puffy clouds.  And then came the wild ponies.  First, I saw them from a far and then close up.  Unperturbed by humans, they beautifully did their thing.  Impossible not to smile.  The Forest Service released these wild ponies, speculated to be descendants of Assateague and Chincoteague ponies, in 1975 to control growth of brush along the balds.  There are about 150 of them.
A bit closer to Virginia's highest peak (Mt.Rogers (5729 ft)), I found a hat that looked suspiciously like Mr. Blue's (who was now 1 day ahead of me).  Sure enough, he had broken his umbrella and had his hat blow off over a ridge in yesterday's storm.  Good thing I'm behind him to pick up his trail of lost items. :)
For the rest of the day, I wandered through interior forest trails and panoramic pastures, close to cows.  Ran into several groups of section hikers around Mount Rogers, but the crowds thinned after that.  Clouds began to gather in the afternoon and I picked up my pace again hoping to get to Lost Mountain Shelter before it rained. I would be out of dry clothes if I got drenched again.  This time I made it to the shelter with 15 minutes to spare.  Yahoo!.  It was much more fun to sit on the floor of the shelter and watch the rain come down.  Since somehow both my battery packs died and I need to save my phone for Damascus tomorrow, it was a quiet night.  I watched the rain come down and the forest darken until my eyes got heavy.
One of my favorite days yet.

"PokeMom, Mr. Blue, Supply Chain & Smiley",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668825,"After my rainy night, I was anxious to get to Damascus today.  Not only does it signify finishing the long Virginia section, but I will see Supply Chain & Smiley and have a Zero day planned. I turned off my phone to make sure I had a little charge left to find them when I reached town. Since the trail had been so fast and now my pack was lighter (no food left and carrying less water) I planned to leave at dawn and try to go as fast as possible...trail jogging where possible.  I fixed a huge cup of coffee and ate 2 peanut butter tortillas and was ready to go once it was light enough to see.  And I flew, gleefully noticing how strong I felt.  After about 30 minute, I crossed a footbridge that looked very familiar.....and then I saw a deer carcass.  A wave of dread.  I saw that dear carcass yesterday as I was pressing to get the the shelter before the rains.  &%$$*#$@!!  I had been going the wrong way.  $%#@&&&^.  Sooooo, 30 minutes later I was back to the starting line.  A bit deflated but still determined to make good time, I took off again.  This time southbound.
The trail was indeed fast.  I connected for a short while with the Virginia Creeper trail before breaking off and heading up the mountain.  Lots of streams flowing full and gradual ups and downs.  And sure enough I made it to Damascus in record time:  2.6 miles/hour.
Supply Chain & Smiley were there to meet me.  We headed over and settled into the Broken Fiddle hostel, a cute bunkhouse in the center of Damascus.  It's obvious that this is a hiker friendly town.  Not only does it host the big Trail Days Festival in May, but you see signs of support everywhere.  Even the placard outside the Baptist church reads ""We Love Hikers"".  Of course the first item on the agenda is always food and while we sat outside at the Wicked Chicken Winghouse & Tavern, we saw a familiar profile walking on the horizon.  Mr. Blue had slackpacked from Elk Garden and joined us just in time for beers.  A break to watch the Women's US Open final, then to The Old Mill for dinner.

Everyone ready to hit the trail again tomorrow.  North Carolina / Tennessee here we come.","Broken Fiddle Hostel - Damascus
