This would be a precursor of things to come.We started to hike and I now know that if a tree falls in the forest it does make a sound...It sounded like a cannon going off and if nobody was there to hear it I'm sure some tree hugger would get a chill up their spine and know something was amiss in the forest. So now we pass alot of people with dogs that day...not small ones but big agressive dogs. What gives? I should be more worried about a bear attacking me than your dog...Selfcenteredness and entitlement on the trail....I was trying to get away from that and there it was....Might as well been talking on your cell phone too!!!

I also found out that if your phone is roaming it drains your battery dead. Oh well. We packed up the soggy plantation and headed for Blood Mountain. It was still foggy when we got there so no views. We really need to bring back the C.C.C. for that shelter is built like a brick shithouse. I could feel the history that was there.The Trail Thugs and I devised a plan where we will buy the shelter and open a Tiki Bar there or put up a fence and charge hikers to hike by. Anyhoo that is very wicked terrain up there where one could get very hurt. We met a nice lady up there without a trail name, so we named her ""Nice Lady"" in a jerry lewis voice. We hike down to Neels Gap where I run into Ron Brown dropping off a hiker...Small World !. We get a Cabin, Dry out are stuff again...I kid you not...Hang our food in a bear canister inside the cabin..There was a tree in the living room so why not!!

Trail Thugs headed out for a 12 mile day. When we stopped for a break we met a couple with two big dogs that they rescued from a hoarder in Kentucky. Turns out they been hopping on trains the last 10 years and decided to hike the trail. Tough Life.When we stopped for lunch I look down on my food bag and see a BIG Tick...Then started looking at my back pack and there was about 5 on there ..Looked on Meatloaf and he had three on his back..Holy Crap!!!there must have been a tick that just hatched some babys and they were all over. Some clouds moved in and it started to sprinkle.This would follow us all afternoon. We got to Low Gap just in time for we were all just about out of water. I have so much respect for a faucet now after getting water out of spings...turn it on and there it is!!By the time we get to the Poplar camp site a storm was a brewing..We set up just in time. We are all in our tents then we hear it..Sounds like a train coming.. I zip down my tent so does the Big Man and we both go..Sounds like Tornadic conditions.. Meatloaf then puts on all his raingear so I guess he wont be as wet when we go flying off the mountain. It dumped hard ...the wind stopped and all was good.We cooked dinner as fast as we could duing a lull ate and went to bed in our soggy tents. Next time we have Tornadic conditions just hold on to a tree for dear life !!!!!!!Good Karma is folowing us......,"Tick...Tick...Tick..No Tock

I am now bipolar and what a difference..Learn as you go.

By now i'm thinking someone could make alot of money if they would put some zip lines across all those gaps on the trail. up-down Up-down. Great veiws along the way and then we run into Rat Man. He told the story of reaching for his flashlight at a shelter and a rat bit him...Might want to get that checked out dude.!! We press on and what a long day it was...12 miles the hard way I say!!! We pick a sight at Tray Mtn on the backside of the Mtn for it is supposed to rain in the morning. On the way to the site we walk passed the shelter and a dog goes after one of the thugs growling and such...Seeing a pattern with dogs too!!! Set up and cook in the dark with flashlights.

We packed up the plantation in the rain which added some poundage...But you know you are soaked when you are packing your tent and can wring water out of it when it's in a bag. Short story long we hiked 11 miles in the pouring rain..One semi break for lunch at Deep Gap but pretty much put are heads down and marched out.

Bionic Elbow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469485,We get back on the trail at Deep Gap and the temp that morning was 33%. These two college are waiting to get picked up and were not prepared for those temps as one guy was in shorts and shivering.This is our last day on the trail for this year so I'm a little melancholy about the hike.Great day for a hike and slack packing to boot.When I get to Dicks Creek Gap I will have knocked out 175 miles of the trail.At this point it does'nt seem like a lot but it is.I feel elated when we reach NC/GA border. Here comes some unexpected rain so we go to Plumorchard Gap. AHHH....The old A-hole stand off where the weekend hikers have taken over the shelter with their dogs and they are not letting you in for nothing. So we stood on the outside of shelter and ate our lunch in the rain.Speaking of not nice people.We picked out a deer stand in the forest on our hike and let's just say ..It is not in one piece anymore or to be found anywhere.Hiking a 100 miles in the beginning you never think you will get there but we did.We got to Dicks Creek and it was packed with hikers ready to go into Hiawassee.There were two hikers there that were scaring the hell out of the women.It looked like they were living as they went...=No money at all.It was so cool to see people giving them whatever they had extra to help them out without JUDGMENT.. for whatever reason.Helping a fellow human...Wow!!! I wished the people at the shelter were privy to that information.....,"He Ain't Heavy,,He's My Brother..

Did they go a certain way just to piss us off?The last 4 years I have had the honor of building 10 miles of hiking and biking trails in Sarasota County.In the Carlton Reserve our group called South County Off Road Riders SCORR have built 5 miles of trails in the woods.The red tape and hoops of fire we had to jump through was amazing.It took a year and a half to get the Ok to build it.Then another 8 months to BoldlyGo where no man had gone before....Hence the name of the trail and to build it by hand..No chainsaws,plows,tractors...All hand tools.The trail has caught on and 100s of people are using it,we have a counter on the trail.Heck let's not stop there.Let's go over to the Myakka State Forest and build another 5 miles of trail...And so we did.This one is called the Palmetto Trail.Built the same way as the other but harder for if you've never been though a wall of Palmetto trees you haven't lived.It was back breaking work,another 7 months of dealing with the state this time and 9 months to build,but it's funny.When you go through sections of the trail you remember certain things about the day you were buiding it.Your mood, the weather,who was working on it that day ect.When the trail ended up on the park map...what an awesome feeling it was.I felt like Steve Martin in The Jerk when he saw his name in the phone bookfor the first time. And to maybe leave something on the planet that might be used for years to come.All from 4 guy's sitting around drinking a beer going ""We need to build some trails""and following through and doing it.

They acted like they were at a camp spot anywhere on the trail.I say this because they were happy,loving and just glad to be out and about and easy to talk to.Just like rolling into a campsite and you all have the love for the AT in common and conversation can go from there.No b.s.,drama,snoring from anybody,just good karma all the way around.For the first time ever for me on stage I smiled for the whole time all four shows as I do when I'm on the trail.I found another Happy Place to go to for the ""AT is in my DNA"".....New slogan for the trail!!!","The Big Shoe

It's 10:30 and I go down to take a pee for there were a bunch of women next to us and I guess it would be inappropriate to do so these days there.As I'm down there I'm thinking we are a little bit loud and need to turn it down a little bit.....Too late!!! I hear one of our guy's yelling ""Get the F out of here!!"" What? is going on.I get back and this guy had come into the campsite and grabbed our fire ring and turned it over for he was tired of that f ing country music..John Prine..and it was quiet time at 10. Quiet time stars at 11pm but I said duly noted and we will ...Now go away!! Long story short the PoPO and the Park Ranger show up and escort him out of the park,Not to jail but the Emergency Room for there concerns of the third degree burns on his hands for they were oozing fluid it was so bad.Dude!! All you had to do was ask to turn it down not destroy two chairs and your hands .Allegedly he was sipping out of a flask all night and was way ahead of schedule on the drinking side. I have never seen anybody lose their shit over John Prine and reggae music.The thing that really stunk the worst was I lost a sentimental gold cross that I have had on all my adventures over the years which I think is in a field where I changed shirts when I got back to the car.

Did not want a road bike but had to for the seat on the other bike was like a couch.But the skinny tires always get flats when carrying weight I have found and more on that later.Take off wearing my airport traveling clothes and right off the bat I get the looks from the Fashion Police. I change 7 miles in but just like I had problems with my saddle bags on the Natchez Trace I did here and found a Vote for somebody sign,bent it in half and that stopped the bags from rubbing on the tires.My goal was 52 miles to Cedar Town and the trail was packed the first 15 miles out.Coming from the land of Cotton Heads the diversity of people on the trail was refreshing for once and not a bunch of cranky old people rattling their jewelry.

I make it to Anniston which is the end of the trail and hang out in the park/campground.

I just bucket listed and did the Cypress and this is what i found.I took my wilderness hiking buddy with me for nobody wanted to go into a bug infested, 9 miles through the water swamp out of 30. We dropped off the truck and met Kay who shuttled us to the Oasis from I 75 and would not take money for the ride but I left it in her car anyway.

Turns out this guy does for we ran out real quick and ended up inventing a new kind of bottled water...Firestone. Yes that's right ! We pulled water out of a jeep trail puddle and filtered it and it was actually not to bad. The views are pretty much the same all day like the picture and did not run into one gator or python snake the whole day or really any other kind of creature except mud, muck and water off and on all day.We get to 11 miles and stop just to be safe for we do not know if there is any dry land ahead and once you are in, you are committed. Do the usual dinner water gimmick before bed and the one thing I couldn't believe was the water was not tanic, but clear and refreshing.So, so far the two different trails are tied on difficulty, water and humidity. The muck makes up for climbing up hill. The big difference is that there are 21 million people in the state of Florida and we are in 700,000 acres of land and we had the whole thing to ourselves.

Turns out it was lightning bugs that were so big and bright like I have never seen before anywhere in my travels. They lit up the tops of trees and looked to be about the size of my fist.Get up the next morning with a good night's sleep and hit the ground running.We still had 20 miles to go to get out of the swamp but we made good time the first 9 miles but then shit got real and was expecting it. We slogged through mile after mile with the only place to sit down was a spit of land here and there.This is where the men and the boy's are separated. One would think the water would be nasty in a swamp but it was actually clear and quite clean. Any alligators or snakes were not to be seen on this trip for some reason even after going through the Black Lagoon.The mud and muck were brutal but we stayed off the side of the trail and blue blazed for the trail it self felt like you were in a ditch. At one point we decided to go for the gold and hike the 20 miles in one day to get out of the swamp for it all looks the same after a while and the skeeters were in full force and there was no shade at all.If it were in the mid 80's would make it questionable to make it out of there.At mile 14 we hit Thank God Island which means every bit of the words and then Poison Oak Island where we me trail maintainers and names I had read in my Florida Trail Magazine. Awesome people and gave us some water and said we could stay but the island was a bit crowded for me and we pressed on. The last 4 miles was still a slog fest but we made it back to my truck by sundown.Didn't think I had 20 miles in me with 5 lbs shoes of mud but I did.

Much to my surprise it was the first time ever, there was a Trail Angel there named Marlene. What an awesome lady and the only thing I wanted was a Coke and some brownies. We had a great one hour conversation and then moved on to Black Bear Resort. This is the most relaxed I've been in years and the trail will do that to you. I guess I was stinking up the office for Dan asked me to take a shower before we went to the store...I didn't think I stunk? Get to a Gas station /Mc Donalds and boy did I pig out!! I had dropped 9lbs on this five day jaunt for you just can't carry enough food for the energy I am putting out. It was nice just to sit and relax and do the normal chores and sleep in a bed. It was one of those things where I sit there and wonder did I really do those 17 to 20 mile days. With all the aches and pains before I left Fla I really wasn't sure how I'd do this time around.

I've played these songs forever in bands and the radio just about went flying off the side of the mountain.Fn Really? 10 billion songs on the planet and they have to keep playing the same crap.

Uncle Johnnies was right there but I needed to make up some miles and didn't want to fall into the Hostel Vortex at 9 in the morning so I figured I would find some water soon. Who knew this was the dry season in Tennessee? With my trusty plastic cup I was able to get some water out of a trickle stream and camel up at the same time.I'm making great time and use to the heat but by the time I get to the power line 12 miles in I need to stop and regroup with some food and water.

In true swamp fashion the bugs are all over our headlamps but the lightning bugs are in full force. We Mr. Magoo our way to our stopping point and set up camp that has benches and wild coyotes yipping about a mile away.

Stop at about 5 miles in to reload water out of a ditch almost with two baby gators in it which means they're peeing in there..Where's Momma?? Ran into our first hiker James and says the trail is the best it's been in four years.Great!!! This trail connects to different management areas and when we roll into the next one and drop down about 20 ft you know you are in for some wet hiking..but it's dry for now. It gets hot and we're going through water a lot faster than anticipated but we manage...Always be prepared,but I didn't follow my own advise. here comes a little rain,then more and then and all out deluge!! My tent is on the outside and just got soaked along with my sleeping bag for it was not supposed to rain at all. Mr gimmick is ahead of me and stops and waits for me without his raincoat and shoes off for he doesn't want to get them wet and freaking out a little for it's the first rain for him. This goes on for an hour so i can check off my bucket list..Watch a dry swamp return to underwater in an hour!! Wade to our destination Bowmen Island and it's soaked. There is a break in the clouds and I set up my tent. Halfway through it dumps again and now the whole tent is drenched...Pissed at myself on this one!!

My goal today is to get my gear dried out but Mr.Gimmick is hell bent on hall ass hiking and pretty much drops me and is ahead by a mile. The secret to 20 mile days is 2mph and easy and steady like a diesel engine because if you got to keep moving on at the end of the day you best have gas in the tank and this has saved me many times.We skip a major swamp section and stay on a dirt road for there will be Tornadic conditions coming this afternoon. Thank goodness there is an observation tower that we plan to meet up at and I do get there in time and dry out my stuff in about 10 minutes because the wind is blowing at about 25mph and storm comes through in 20 minutes. Takes about an hour to blow through and we are on our way for the last 6 miles of swamp hiking and at times up to the knees for about a mile. The destination is the Lucky Camp Site and I'm glad I reserved that one for the one before was not Lucky conditions...Should be called ShitHole Camp. Here's where the diesel thought process came in handy for it was quite the push to get to Lucky and Mr.Gimmick was going on fumes but we did make it. Do the ritual end of the day stuff but we now can hear cars and such so back to civilization or near it now and still have 20 miles left to go to the Atlantic Ocean tomorrow.By Florida standards with the cold front going through it will be like hiking in the A/C.

Bionic Elbow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662861,"I was getting ready for my A.T. hike this year and noticed this is my 10th year of starting to hike. I think there were 2 years I skipped and did Natchez Trace and Silver Comet and maybe throw in a year or two of the Covid Gimmick, but I'm 700 miles in and still returning to keep pushing on. So speaking of returning and this is so appropriate for this years adventure, but General MacArthur said...""I made it through but, I shall return"". I've been Manager at MacArthur Beach Condos in Venice for 26 years(Unheard Of In This Business) This years hike has me in Virginia hiking to the first Inn in the U.S. called MacArthur Inn at about 117 miles from my drop off point at Dickey Gap. Thinking about this RLASH I'm HYOH for it gives me something to look forward to every year and never would I have been able to get away for 6 months without pissing off everyone in my world. Fact I have to live with. So once again over the years I found I'm better off enjoying the trail on my own. As much as I want to take people along it just doesn't work out enjoyable for me. The first complaint and I lose my shit. I would think with Indian blood in me I would be mellow, but it's in competition with the German in me and I have a low threshold for whining...Changing things up to see if I can not drop 10 lbs by adding more calories, but it is so fun every year to eat whatever I want for a month to put it back on. Quad Burgers..Bring it on.. Especially at my age everyone is on a diet for lack of exercise. So let the planning begin,love reading the journals,training, eating my vitamins, Properly pumping up to get ready to do the most miles I've ever done on the trail this year......Cause it's a..... Really Long Ass Section Hike.....Bring It On...Oh It Been Broughton......","Mac Beach Venice Fl To Mac Inn Narrows Va

Bionic Elbow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666809,"Been getting the body in shape to do another as ""Far As I Can Go"" in 8 days...Weather Depending..The good thing about a section hike is that I have learned so much over the years that I really have it dialed in this year of what I need and don't need. Going at it solo gets me grounded after floods, hurricanes, work stress, and daily life I get to reset. The picture is my homestead life where I have Mc Mansions just built on either side of me and there's my humble 1953 brick shit house in the middle of the chicanery still standing. Here's to another safe hike and the body holds up with the mileage I'm shooting to do in two weeks....Feets don't fail me now!!!","Mac Beach

Bionic Elbow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/667941,"I should have learned by now is I have a lot more energy if I didn't gig the two nights before, that I have to get up at 4am to get to airport. I booked this knowing the gig should have been canceled because of rain...but we're in a drought in Fla the last 2 months and the Show Must Go On!! Who Knew? I check my bag, get pistol whipped in security for being from Venice Fl ..A 5th time? and proceed to the plane to be treated like cattle in Atlanta. Have a great conversation on the plane..and I'm a quiet person..about Fl Crackers and how they were the toughest SOBs to live in Fl without A/C in the 1800s. Apparently Allegiant traded training pilots with Delta for we Gobsmacked the runway in Roanoke and it's been years since I have hit that hard. Let's just say the pilots were the first off the plane and didn't stand around to get ""The What For"" or the ""Buh Byee!!"" Shuttle is there have a great discussion about American History and then I get dropped off where I left off going south the year before at Dicky Gap Va with Mr. Gimmick and going solo. Take off like getting shot out of a cannon and 8 miles into it ..Here comes the rain..and the nights before lack of sleep and I need to stop before it starts dumping but I wanted to go further just in case of bad weather or what ever shit that is thrown at me the next 8 days. I see and area that looks overgrown but could possibly be a campsite and low an behold it is..it was..it shall be now, a stopping point. With a discombobulated fire ring it was awesome!! With a breeze off the west and know better now to ever camp in a gap unless its cold. What better way to start off a trip being 1-0 on perfect camp site. Set up, do duties, and 8:00pm Boom Boom! out goes the lights I get a great nights sleep with the rain tapering off so there's not a 12 pound tent added to my 34 pound pack carrying 7 days of food the next morning when packing up the plantation to press on with the hike. Body check..Firing on all cylinders!!","Dickey Gap

Bionic Elbow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668333,"Slept pretty good for being exhausted, where usually I'm so tired I can't sleep. I'm hoping the peak refuel dinners will keep me from dropping a lot of weight. Hoping to pick up some fuel for I have to cold soak my meals right now for driver forgot my fuel for stove. Packed up and rolling by 7:00am and now it's time for the ""Did I Pick The Right Campsite Game""!! Was there a better one ahead? Could sit on a log? 4 miles in later and didn't have the gas in the tank to go that far the day before...The answer is...I picked the right place to stop..I'm 1 -0 on this trip. Make it to Partnership Shelter and other than the Hilton Shelter, this one is VERY nice!! Being so close to a Visitor Center there's not much Shenanigans that can go on for trashing the place. Get a Coke at VC and charge my phone. For some reason I am eating up a lot of battery real quick in that between car ride charge and here I would be at 30% one day in and shutting it down and in airplane mode. I do not use apps or anything phone involved in my navigation but A.T. guidebook veneered. Didn't one year and had scraps of paper to try to navigate with. Press on and around lunch here comes the rain again. Virginia is for lovers because you can't go outside for it's raining all the time...Bangada Bangada!!Get to old school house and what a cool piece of history and the times have changed. What? No A.C. or cell service in this place? This is an Outrage!! Get to Atkins and load up on Junk food but get a coke for later to push me up the hills tomorrow. Mexican place is closed...I Yi Yi Yi !!! Get to field with fence stile and take some great pictures with the sun setting and feel like I'm trespassing but not. Nice breeze by stile to dry out clothes, so I don't push on to Davis Hollow camp site which is in a gap, so I stop here for the night as I get a look from the nearby deer looking at me like...Chico, we live here Mang, just don't eat our food and good luck finding water.....","Double Secret Camp Site

Bionic Elbow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668563,"Great night sleep without the deer giving me trouble. Once again play the ""Did I pick the better camp spot""? and Yes I did for Davis Hollow was not to level and no breeze and Davis Path was just o.k. I'm 2-0 on great sites. Found it hilarious that people would follow a fence line thinking the white tips were the blazes but you never know with HYOH. Make great time and run into my first hiker since the start two days ago. Uneventful day and make it to the washed out Lick Creek Bridge and water is low to ford and what a mess to get that whole Cluster Mess out of there and rebuild. This was the most buggiest site ever on this trip and had to put a rag on my head to stop the madness of them all around me. Settle down for bed and about a half hour later...CRASH goes a tree about 30 feet from the tent. Scared the crap out of me and takes a while till I can get to sleep...Hopefully a better tomorrow and a little less rain......","Fence Stile
