At about 11 Parked car and had about a 1/2 mile walk to the base of Amicila falls, the the 700 or whatever steps UP to the top . Wilson hated the expanded metal stairs . Then the 9-10 mile approach trail. It was a brutal but somewhat fitting intro to the start of the adventure 


Met 2 more prior thru hiker- grand Entrance and another gal 
Trail magic : passed a ridge runner crew and experienced guy helped tighten my pack and just lift up our spirits 

2.8 actual AT miles put us at Stover creek shelter. RT was already there and he’s a soft spoken unassuming guy in his 60s from VT. Retired violin bow maker , got along great with Wilson, who I’m starting to call Snoopy",,View Entry,"Jan 31, Tue",0

Rain all day. Just walked with our heads down. Wilson doesn’t like being wet. Temps in 40s I bet, Thought about stopping at Woods hole but decided to head up Blood mt. Arrived at the shelter about 2:45 and it was too nasty to stop up there so called for a cabin at Misty mts. Passed Kayainne while bombing down to neel gap. He ended up sharing the dragon fly cabin with us and it was a needed warm up, dry out and get clean&  sleep in a real bed stop! Thanks Angie for setting it u p when I lost service ce.

Got on trail about 11. Wilson spotted an armadillo! Caught up with RT around 1. Planned to sleep at/ near low gap but got cell service and Abe said he’d be swinging by around 9:30 am tomorrow after getting Prius from AFSP, so we booked it to next shelter , last mile or so in the dark. Met another thru hiker, Churchill. While setting up the Hammock in the shelter, a section hiker, Chris strolled up from Unicoi gap. Good convo.

I’m awake catching up with this journaling at 2 bc it’s too cold to sleep! Held my bladder till after midnight cuz I didn’t want to crawl out of this warm s. bag. Wilson is curled up on my left side and Chris is softly snoring. It’s a good night to be on the trail","Neel gap

Hit the trail about 7:30 after a gorgeous sunrise . Made good time coming down the hill to Unicoi gap. Met an older gentleman that had planned to thru hike the AT in the 80’s but backpacked Europe instead. His gave me hot cocoa which was much appreciated cuz it was only about 25 degrees! Abe and Cay picked us up and provided snacks while we drove to Ami Falls SP to get the car, Wilson and Reggie had fun seeing each other again. Abe went hiking there so Cay drove us back to continue. There were about 5 cars at the pull off when we left at 9:30 and about 30 when we got dropped off around 1, the trail was packed with ppl. Did about another 7 miles but all up/down !

Nice day but cold and windyDid about 6 miles and ate lunch near Deep gap shelter. 2 quick miles and called the Hostel around the bend for a ride but when we got to Dicks Creek gap a guy offered a ride. Super nice hosts and other guests . Met thru hikers Mike and Fran, a sweet Georgia couple. Also talked with a last year flip flopper who is working here. Had dinner then went to town and got groceries and had dinner again!

Snoopy and I were both in good shape after a restful afternoon at the hostel. It was awesome having fresh fruit and a lively conversation over bfsst.  Got dropped off around 8. Pack is overfilled from 1st resupply box. Pbly packing too much dog and human food. Weighed it at #45! Passed Mike and Fran a couples hours into hiking as they had been shuttled to do a quick 5.8 mile SB slack. Then while taking a break was passed by my first nobo th, a crazy guy called ineeda (pronounced Anita) Trail name. At the state line (goodby GA!) caught up with him and DaVinci, a flip -flopper almost finishing his hike , he’s on the last state and we just finished our first! only 12 more state lines to cross! Later was able to talk ineeda into taking some of my food, seemed to be a blessing for both of us!

We went from standing Indian to Long Branch Shelter 17+ miles, a good day, especially with the Albert MT climb, that last push to the summit was killer! Tomorrow we have the option of a short 11.5 day or an 18+… guess we’ll see what the weather has in store for us. Had a nice phone conversation with Angie too. I miss talking and just spending time together. Only saw one other hiker today, it was while we were having lunch at Carter gap shelter. Snoopy barked at him and the dude just turned around so I never even got to yak at him.  I think he was a SOBO. In the shelter journals are more entries from Southbounders (SOBOs) than NOBOs. Oh yeah, we passed the 100 mile mark on the trail!","Standing indian

Since breaking camp we passed a SB hiker w dog (the dog was not too friendly so we didn’t chat) then met a trail maintenance crew rebuilding Rock gap shltr. Talked with them for a few mins, one guy asked if we were Snoopy and CB ?!? How did he know who we are?  I guess there is another dude hiking with his dog a day or two ahead of us that are Shaggy and Scooby! Big push up hill, then mostly downhill for the rest of the day. 
Passed a really pretty Waterfall near winding stair gap 


Passed thru a prescribed burn area . Glad for the mist and drizzle to keep the dust and ash down. Thought about stopping at a shelter there but made the push to the next one. A big climb brought us to the top of Wayah Bald mountain but no view b/c of the mist and clouds/fog. Couple hundred foot descent to the shelter tho, and the fog lifted a bit and had good cell service. Was able to call and chat with family. I thought we’d have this shelter to ourselves but right at dusk a solo NB hiker gal, Piniata, rolls in. She just came from a resupply day in Franklin, N.C. It’s nice to talk about adventures and experiences so far with another hiker.

Misty and light rain most of the morning, cleared up in the afternoon. 3rd day in a row of climbing up to either an old fire or observation tower. Todays was Wesser Bald. Too rainy to enjoy much of a view but after another mile or two the trail ride the top of this really skinny ridge line with the mountain just failing away on both sides, it was pretty neat. But I was grateful that the wind wasn’t blowing any stronger! I thought Wilson would be nervous but he did fine. Then a big long descent ( went from 4600ft to 1700ft elevation) to get down to Nantahala Outdoor Center. I couldn’t believe who was sitting in front of the general store when we got down here… Anita (ineeda) ! He got pulled off trail when they closed it to do the burn area we walked thru a couple of days ago. He was in good spirits about it though, and was gearing up to go do about 10 miles, and this was at about 4pm! Snoops and I just wanted to shower and sleep. We got a little bunk room and slept for about 10 hours! I’m packing stuff up now and we’ll hit the trail in a couple of hours.

We had a lazy morning (and another shower for me!) hot breakfast and talked to a few locals before packing up and heading back down to the river to print out the Smokies Permit. About 10:15 on the trail now making up for all of the elevation loss we experienced yesterday. Passed some day hikers, a sobo, whose name I didn’t get and a bit later, a legally blind hiker, Crockett and Piniata again! Great to chat with them all for a bit. After about 8 hard miles we are currently sitting on top of Cheoah Bald. Snoops is sleeping in the sunshine! It’s a perfect early afternoon, sunshine and views for miles. Oh, Had my first full on face plant today. I was attempting to hop over a large tree that had toppled over the trail (called a dead fall) when my foot, instead of finding a grip on the trunk, just slid, and my weight took me face first to the trail. When yr wearing such a heavy pack, there is a point when yr powerless to stop gravity and the best you can do is try to land in a way that will cause the least harm. Luckily for me, the trail was relatively soft and no stones or roots to slam into. Scooby just looked at me like, “man, how have you made it this far in life being such a klutz!?!” That dog is so sure footed, I’ve only seen him slip once since we’ve started hiking, and that was on a Shet of ice that was covering a large rock/boulder. Stopping to stealth camp just north of NC 143. We can hear the traffic on the hwy below us. Good night!","NOC

After an aggressive ascent on a section of trail called Jacobs Ladder (like the exercise equipment) we popped into Brown Fork Gap shelter and another Nobo thru hiker with his dog was there, Merlin and Wade. We met them at NOC and would end up leap frogging them all day and shared the Fontana Dam shelter with them for the nite. Snoopy and Wade hit it off and it’s nice for him to have a pal. Merlin is a very experienced hiker, he did 3/4 of the AT a few yrs ago and has done the CDT. We stopped for Lunch at Cable gap shelter


Met 3 SOBOs through out the day, No Bed,Prometheus and Slug . So happy for them all to be almost done! Great advice about getting ice cleats from Abe and upcoming trail conditions. Got some nice pics when Lake Fontana came into view and then we descended and walked along the lake for a mile or two.

Raining when we went to bed & still raining when we Woke up at Fontana Dam shelter.  Actually, there was a severe wx advisory for all of the Smokies for the day. So instead of starting the Smokies wet and cold, made the decision to take a zero and head into Asheville. 


While hanging in shelter talked with a dude that finished his flip flop back on Dec. (White socks) . Now he is helping support a gal ( Diesel) as she is finishing u her sobo. 
Cay picked us (and Merlin and Wade) and drove us the 2 hrs into town. We dropped M/w off at a buddies and then we went on to Abe’s place to get a shower and clean up, do laundry, etc. Had a nice pizza dinner with Abe and Cay, even caught some of the Superbowl. And then went back and played board games. It was so nice to sleep in a comfy bed.","Fontana dam

Kinda lazy morning, I took the dogs for a walk and caught up on some reading. About 10am heard fromMerlin that a buddy of his could drive us back up to the dam so Aaron took me over and around 1 we found ourselves back on the trail (but without Snoopy… he’ll be hanging out with Reggie till I’m thru the GSMNP. Did about 12 miles to the first shelter in the Smokies with a short side trail to the Shuckstack fire tower for a beautiful 360 degree lookout. On the way up passed a couple of SB hikers that had tried to get to Clingman Dome But the snow had driven them back. Around the 4000’ mark the trail was still under a couple of inches of slushy snow. We made the correct call to postpone a day. Sharing this shelter with a recently retired Coastie! It was cool to “talk shop” with him. FDam shelter to Mollies Ridge Shelter 11.8

Linus stopped by the shelter at about 6:30am, that guy is an early riser! I hit the trail about 8. Made good time to Clingman’s Dome. Got some pics of the fog! Also made good time the Newfoundland Gap parking area. It was kinda odd to pop out of the woods and be surrounded by cars and tourists. It was nice to use a real restroom! The small joys, right? Had lunch there then just three miles to Icewater Spring Shelter. Got a good fire going, dry socks on, life is good. Just over 13 miles today but tomorrow I’m planning on doing 20+, which will set me up for just an 11 mile day on Friday to get out of the Smokies and get cleaned up at Standing Bear Farm hostel.

Early start to this long day. The mist and fog had been rolling into the shelter so everything was pretty damp packing it up. Trail is in decent shape except Lots of blown down trees. Another day of hiking in the blowing mist. Passed zero ppl. Just leapfrogging the other two hikers that I’m with, Merlin and Topo. Topo joined us in the shelter last night and he’s a fast hiker. He’s excited b/c his family is meeting him on Friday at the hostel & it sounds like he will spend the weekend with them before hopping back on trail. Finally, a little after 1pm the weather finally lifted. At that point I had less than 5 miles to go to get to the shelter so I just slowed down to enjoy hiking in the peek-a-boo sun. It felt great . Got to the shelter and have dry clothes  (especially socks!) on. Just finished a tuna fish pouch for dinner. My food bag is getting pretty light but I’ll be able to restock tomorrow! Supposed to start raining again around 8 pm and tomorrow will be wet. All good and happy to be leaving the GSMNP!","Icewater Spring Shelter
",Cosby Knob Shelter,"Feb 16, Thu",20.30
C B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660184,"The shelter we (Merlin and Wade, Topo and I) slept at was great. A beautiful bubbly spring only about 10 steps to the right & a working privy (outhouse) ! These are rare in the Smokies. We were also blessed with a valley view and dry firewood. We let the fire burn out around 7pm when we crawled into our sleeping bags. About 8 the rain started. It rained all night and the pounding on the tin roof of the shelter would drown out anyone’s snoring. It would let up for a few minutes then cascade down again. Crash, crash … like an overworked cymbal in a punk song! I loved it. I woke up around 6am to find Topo packing up his gear. I said goodbye and wished him well then went back to sleep. An hour later I was up as the first bit of daylight pushed thru the rain and fog (or smoke, as they call it in these mountains). M & W packed up and hit the trail before I did. I just didn’t want to step out of the shelter into all that rain especially knowing that I had a relatively easy 11 miles to the hostel. But about 8:30 I finally ran out of excuses and put on all my rain gear (first day of the hike starting out in rain pants) , strapped on my pack on shoved off . The trail was basically a cascading stream. The ground was already saturated and all this new water needed a place to go, and the trail is often the lowest and most convenient place for the water to channel into. On the uphills I was walking against the flow and on the downhills it was trying to take away my footing on the slick rocks. And the wind driven rain just kept falling! Around 10, it finally let up but the temperature was continuing to drop. The rain turned into light snow. But about 9 of the 11 miles were down hill so I made good time. The trail crossed the first major interstate (I-40) and immediately began climbing again . I crossed a small dirt road and a car pulled over and Topo rolls down the back window. His folks had just picked him up at the hostel. He passed me a big handful of gummy worms and encouraged me that I’m almost there. 
Ahhhh, Standing Bear Farm is great. I checked in and stripped off all of my soaking rain gear on the covered porch of the bunk room. Pulled all of my dirty laundry out of my pack and went to the laundry room.  It’s hand wash yr clothes in a sink bit they do have an electric dryer. So I get my washing done, throw the mess into the dryer and go find a hot shower… so nice. I then go claim a bunk and explore the rest of the property. There seems to be a handful of folks who are staying here (work for stay) and some, like me that are just passing through. I run into Merlin, Wade and Linus . I also meet Ed and his little dog, Bailey. They have a little store here with a handful of gf options. It’s chicken stew and tortilla chips for dinner. It’s nice to be done walking so early in the day,  especially since the weather continues to be miserable, alternating from rain to snow to sleet. Having a warm stove and a place to fully dry out all my gear is perfect. And the best news is that Abe’s bringing Wilson in the morning!

After a nice long night in a comfy bunk at Standing bear farm hostel , got up and made coffee! It had been over a week, I think since I’d had a cup of joe. Went for a walk and got in touch with Abe, who was just waking up to come drive my way. Yakked with some of the other people staying there and eventually (when it was late enough West coast time) called Angie. Abe got in around 10 after I got all of Snoopy’s gear out of the car he helped me finish packing up, but first I had to eat some of the food he’d brought! We hit the trail about 11 and made it to a shelter about 6 miles north where we had lunch , then Abe turned around to hike back to the car while Snoops and I pushed on. A couple more miles later and we found ourselves in Max Patch Bald, a beautiful open spot with views in all directions for miles and miles. It was a nice afternoon/almost evening and lots of folks had hiked up to enjoy the scenery. It’s an odd feeling to be walking for many and only seeing a few people and then all of a sudden you’re in a spot where you are surrounded by folks. After I left the bald I passed an area where some families were camping. Ended up talking with some of them for about 1/2 hour about our hike so far and what to expect ahead. Good trail magic! A couple quick miles down into a cold cold slushy gully and we are now stretched out in our sleeping gear at Roaring fork shelter. Merlin and Wade and another Nobo that I just met, Switchback, were already posted up here. It was about a 15.5 mile day today. It feels like it’s gonna be a cold night but just 18 miles tomorrow and we’ll be in Hot Springs! Good night, 


At around 10:30, I wake up to Snoopy barking. There are 3 ppl with headlamps and flashlights coming down the trail. They identified themselves as with something something volunteer fire department and they are out looking for a hiker that hasn’t checked in for a while, Earl. Well, it turns out Switchback is Earl! His family hadn’t heard from him, and he had some excuse about the communication device account not being set up correctly. Everyone was nice about the whole situation and he seemed embarrassed. Any way, my lesson learned is to check in regularly (which I believe I do)!","Stand Bear Farm

C B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660201,"I was up before the sun and packing up in the predawn light. I knew we had a long mileage day and wanted to get into town and look around before dark. Snoopy and I made some of our best time yet the first couple of hours, probably doing 3ish miles/hr. It was the 2nd day in a row of beautiful weather, before too long I had shed my morning layers and was hiking in shorts and a tee shirt. After we stopped for lunch around noon, we finally slowed down some and started to enjoy the hike. We got to the hostel before 3pm, showered and went into town to check out the sights and get groceries. It’s a sleepy little hiking/tubing/soaking in the hot springs place. The downtown is about 3 full blocks. The visitor center was nice and we popped into the outfitters, but we are not really lacking or needing to upgrade any gear. So we just came back and chatted with the other hikers here while I made us breakfast for dinner (eggs and pancakes). Now we are windong down in bed and planning our stops/miles for the next week or so (weather permitting). People have asked me how I’m or we (snoopy and I ) are doing physically. Well, at the end of each day, I think that both of us are just sore all over. I haven’t noticed Wilson limping or favoring any limb/paw and I look him all over and kinda generally give him a rub down each evening . And every morning he’s ready to go. As for me, my right calf muscle has been sore for a few days in a row and today I noticed my left shoulder is “talking to me” a bit louder than other parts but overall, I think we are both holding up well. I’m planning on between 12-15 mile days for a bit, just so we are not pushing too hard. Now that I’m a couple of days out of the Smokies, here is my reflection:entered the National Park section (around 70 miles of the AT is in the park) of the trail on a Monday pm, following a storm that left a couple inches of slushy snow on about 1/2 of the trail 
pros:
Nice shelters , good blazes, fireplaces, great views (for the 2 afternoons it was clear), trail not unnecessary routed to the top of every peak (allowed some respite from wind) Never met a Ranger
Cons: cost $ to get permit ( or risk fine), no dogs allowed, lots of felled trees, no privy’s at most shelters, all of the rules are negatively worded, AT seems an afterthought to other park activities , permit box on S entry was packed full (no real accountability)

C B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660224,"Left Laughing Heart hostel about 9, got thru town and back in the woods about 10am. The plan was to just do about 11 miles to the first shelter but when Snoopy and I got there at about 1:45pm, we were both feeling good and it seemed too early to stop. I was kinda on the fence but then it stopped raining so we decided to push an additional 8.6 miles to the next shelter. Got here right before sunset. Nice view from this shelter. The plan for tomorrow is that we’ll do a relatively short 14 miles.Well, today is the 3 week mark. Someone asked about where we’ve been sleeping so let’s see if I can recap: 


1st night, 1/31- shelter with one other hiker
2-  hammock camped
3- Misty Mountain cabin we shared w/ another hiker 
4- shelter w 1 other hiker
5- shelter by ourselves 
6th night , Sun. 2/5-Around the bend hostel, there were just two other hikers staying there
7&8- shelters by ourselves 
9- shelter w 1 other hiker
10- thurs, 2/9- cabin-ish room at NOC, similar to a hostel 
11- tent camped (stealth, which just means it wasn’t at a established campsite)
12- Fontana Dam shelter with 1 other hiker and his dog ( they call the FD shelter the Hilton b/c it has phone charging ports, a free shower, and an awesome view of the lake)
13, Superbowl Sunday- house. zero day (no miles/ no progress on AT) We went to Asheville and crashed at Abe’s! 
Nights 14-17, hiking thru the Smokies. Had to stay at shelters. No Snoopy ( he was with Abe) I was meeting another hiker at pre-agreed upon shelters the entire time and a second NB hiker joined us the last two nights
18th night , Fri 2/17- Standing Bear Hostel, there were 3 or 4 other hikers that stayed there that night 
19- Got Snoops back, stayed at a shelter with two other hikers and 1 other dog
20 th night, Sun 2/19- Laughing Heart hostel in Hot Springs, there were about 7 other hikers (only 2 thru hikers, the rest are section hikers) there last night
Tonight, our 21st night on this adventure, it’s just Snoopy and I in a shelter. And it will be either shelters (or camping) for the next 3-4 nights before we hit the next hostel! 


So, final count of the first 3 weeks is: 
House-1 time
Cabin (shared)- 1 time
Hostels- 4 times 
Tent/hammock camping- just 2 times
Shelters- 13 times

Packed up and we’re on the trail by 7:30. Big uphill climb but some wonderful views. I can used to walking in this sunshine, it hasn’t happened enough so far ! Got to a shelter for breakfast at about 10 and a 20ish something hiker was sleeping in. Talked some to him while going about chores (food for Snoopy and I - 2nd breakfast or 1st lunch- fill water bottles, organize pack for the day, etc) 
Went about 1/2 mile down the trail and talked with a 4 person trail maintenance crew that were headed to check out the shelter we just left. A couple of miles later we crossed a fairly busy road ( US23) and then passed a total of 4 more hikers (a few with dogs) . Yakked with one local guy for about an hour while enjoying the sun and views of Big Bald (5500’ elevation). It’s crazy to pass so many folks after seeing no one yesterday!

Windy all night. Not too cold and just a little smattering of rain. About 4 am woke up to music. The song was “Man on the Run”! It was a Nobo hiker and Wilson was growling. I could see the light of their headlamps bouncing along . I guess if I was hiking in the dark, blasting some tunes might make sense. Later, at the hostel I found out it was Topo! He apologized for his early morning actions and said he recognized Snoopy when he saw him under the tarp. 
Broke camp about 7. Mostly downhill to Erwin but not entirely! Steep ascent to high rocks lookout where we took some sunrise pictures. For the last 10 days or so the trail has been literally straddling the NC/TN state line. But today the trail takes a big curve and goes way into NC towards flattop mt before it crosses the border again and tonight I’ll be pretty far into TN. After the long descent, we checked into Uncle Johnny’s hostel where we are now sharing a room with Merlin and Wade. Always feels good to get a shower and do laundry. Snoopy and I both have some “town food” in our bellies and we are making plans for the next few days. I think there is at least 5 thru hiker/ long section hikers at the hostel tonight. Topo will be up and on the trail early. Two other guys are going to slack pack it tomorrow. Merlin and Wade plan to take a zero tomorrow since they have a supply box scheduled to arrive on Saturday. Snoops and I plan to enjoy the morning here and then get a late start on the trail and see how far we get. Life is good!","Stealth camp near Whistling Gap

17.2 miles from UJ’s to Cherry gap shelter. Passed a guy on trail w 3 dogs and chatted w him for a bit. Humped thru Beauty spot clearing. At some point in the afternoon the temp dropped and a cold rain started falling. Not hard, but big cold drops. The trail passed over Unalaska mountain, which was a dense spruce forest. Odd. On most days the change in vegetation as we work our way up in altitude is fairly predictable. Soft trees like cotton woods in the lower gaps. The Nolchucky river in Erwin, where we crossed it is at less than 1700 ft. Big river trees plus skinny birch and aspens. Then, maybe in the 3-4000 ft range is all of the big deciduous trees, mostly oaks, but some other hard woods, too. Forests that are still bare, with lots of dead leaves on the ground, forests you can see 100 yards or more through, not much under brush. Then come areas with the hemlocks mixed in, they are the first evergreens, and lots of rhododendrons and some holly. Things get green but still leafy. Then there’s a certain altitude where it’s almost all pines. It starts with these small coned stubby pines , the pine cones are about the size of jelly beans, cute little pine cones all over the ground but then they transition to larger pine trees with 6 in needles on the ground and cones roughly the size and shape of bananas. I like walking thru those areas b/c when it’s dry, it feels like we are in the pine woods of AZ. Rocky terrain under foot and all these soft pine needles. But today this relatively tall mountain ( 5100 ft) was just covered in dense spruce trees, felt like a NW forest. Then coming down the mountain the pattern repeats. Now we are at about 4200 ft in the oak and rhodys again. This is an older shelter, but nice. I’m ready to sleep. Good night!","Uncle Johnny’s

It started raining over night. Topo, who I thought was ahead of me, came in late to the shelter but before it began raining. At morning light it was still raining. Not crazy but constantly. Topo left first, he said his goal was to get to a shelter about 23 miles  up trail. Our goal was one about 17 and 1/2 miles out. As we started walking the rain got more intense. Eventually it became this wind driven downpour. It was like the drops were racing against one another to be the first to splatter on something solid. It felt like when you take a handful of sand and throw it down, it was like the rain was being hurled down by a great force. Everything was soaked. Snoopy kept looking for a dense tree or a rock overhang, anything to provide cover. But we marched on. The first shelter we passed was nine miles from where we started. It was 1/4 mile off trail. I debated skipping it but we both needed a break. We trudged down the sloppy trail and there was Topo! Eating his lunch with a big grin on his face. We didn’t have cell service and didn’t stay long . I made sure Snoopy got a good meal and I snacked on a few things but I was cold and knew that we couldn’t stop for long or it would be difficult to get moving again. Topo did have service so he was updating ppl when Snoopy and I left. The only other person that we saw in the additional 8.5 to the shelter we are at now was a shuttle driver that we had met a few days ago at UJ’s. He was searching for a couple of day hikers that he thought were on the trail near us and would like a ride out of the nasty weather. We obviously hadn’t seen them but as we passed his car near Hughes Gap Rd he offered to top off our water bottle and gave Snoopy some dog treats. He is a true trail angel and his generosity was greatly appreciated. The shelter we are at now is called Roan High Knob and happens to be the highest elevation shelter on the entire trail at almost 6200 feet. It’s also unique in that it is an old fire service cabin with all 4 walls and a door we can shut to keep out the rain and wind. When we arrived and started unpacking, most of my gear had stayed relatively dry, so I was able to get on dry clothes and toweled off Snoopy. Just as I was getting our beds set up in strolls Topo. This is as far as he’s going. I don’t blame him and it nice to share a shelter with someone ya know, ya know? 
Anyway, We now got supper in our bellies, a warm sack to sleep in, rain drops on a tin roof to lull us to sleep. Life is good.","Cherry Gap

My alarm went off at 4am! Topo wants an early start to the day b/c it isn’t forecasted to rain, and he wants to do 25+ miles. Snoopy and I have about 16 to get to the hostel where we have a package waiting but I agreed to get up early so Topo and I can stop for lunch before he heads on and we head to a shower! 


We made good time in the dark and the starlit sky was just breathtaking! Sunrise found us at an old barn where a few ppl were camping. A short time later we crossed the NC/TN line for the last time! Pushing up to the top of Hump Mountain was definitely a hump but that made for a nice long easy descent to Hwy 19E. We walked about 1/3 of a mile uphill to a nice restaurant/bar called the Station where a trail angel named Lucky Charm made us lunch. Then Topo pushed on while Snoopy and I cruised another .4 miles downhill to the Mountain Harbour hostel where we are posted up for the night. I got caught up on laundry, fixed supper and have enjoyed chatting with the other guests. The re-supply pckg we got was packed full of all kinds of good stuffAND we had a letter from the Indiana Bartlett crew! Almost too much good stuff for one afternoon! It feels great to be clean, dry and in a warm bed. Thanks for reading!","Roan High Knob

Just 8.9 easy miles today. I’ve been telling myself to take a light day for about a week now. I didn’t think Snoopy or I needed a zero but did want only about 1/2 day of hiking. Waking up at the hostel, getting caught up on paying some bills and “life chores” and then checking the weather where I saw thunderstorms forecasted for late afternoon, and I told myself that today was the day to take it easy on the trail. Had some yogurt and granola for breakfast, got a cup of coffee in my belly and we were hitting it by about 9:30. The trail was still pretty wet and sloppy from the previous rain but the sun was shining and the dew was drying up. Todays hike took us past 2 waterfalls and along the Elk river for about a mile. We haven’t hiked near very many big bodies of water (the exceptions , of course , being Lake Fontana and short sections along two rivers in towns- first the French Broad in Hot Springs and then the Nolichucky in Erwin) so it was nice to enjoy the small river. It’s about the size of the Ceder River in Renton and it was just a beautiful hike. We also went past a small cemetery and a church. I had just talked to my mom about not seeing many early spring blooms and this bunch of daffodils appear along the trail! Didn’t see anyone on the trail all day. Got to the shelter about 3, right before the first rain showers started falling. As we were setting up our beds, a couple of NoBos popped in but they both wanted to push on to the next shelter. First there was Blizzard, who is (only)hiking the first 1000 miles of the AT as a warm up to hiking the PCT later this year(crazy), and who I had met before and then a younger guy named Ian, who I hadn’t yet meet. He’s one of the group of hikers that started the first week of Feb and are making big miles. Good to chat with both of them while making dinner. It’s only 6:40 but the sun has already set so Snoops and I are in bed. Tomorrow we are planning for about an 18 mile day!","Mountain Harbor

Hit the trail about 7 and the sunshine didn’t stop all day! The trail walking surface has been in good shape but the number of blow downs that we need to climb over/under/around has been increasing. Sometimes you find a way around one big chest level tree just to find another one 30 feet later down the trail. Hard to get a good hiking rhythm going. Some are knee knockers and others are clothes liners.  Alright , I’ll stop my whining:) Only saw one guy with a dog all morning. The trail passes a couple of more cool waterfalls including Laural Falls which is a popular day hike destination. The trail actually winds right along the river for a ways. Lots of ppl hiking in/out from two different parking areas near the town of Hampton, TN. Probably passed 20+ ppl in the last two hours of hiking. Decided to camp near the river and save a big up/down for tomorrow morning. After setting up the tent, Snoopy and I walked the mile or so into town and bought a few things at a little grocery store. Ate soup heated up on the campfire and are now in bed. Tomorrow is also supposed to be nice so I think we’ll do a big day that should set us up nicely for getting into VA on Friday!","Mountaineer Shelter

Broke camp after a peaceful night by the Laural River. Hiked the 1/2 mile or so back to the AT and then up and over Pond Mountain. Had some great views of Wataga Lake as the sun was popping up from the East. Passed by the road to Boots Off Hostel about 9am but instead of heading up for a cup of coffee we decided to press on. While walking by the lake we met a guy who was thru hiking last year but blew out his knee so he is picking up where he left off but gonna take ‘er real slow to begin with. His son just started at Springer a few days ago and will eventually catch up and they plan on finishing together. I can’t remember the guys name but his kid is Rusty.  I see in the journals and shelter walls that Piñata is about 1/2 day ahead of Snoopy and I. I was also texting Topo and he is in Damascus already, so about 2days ahead of us. We are now stopped for the night at Iron Mountain Shelter. As we were settling down, up the trail strolls Ranger (Ian). Nice to talk to him over dinner and as we’re getting into bed. Snoopy is in good shape. The trail has been in good condition and except for the higher than average number of blowdowns , no complaints. I gotta watch the water sources a little closer, we got thirsty mid day today and we were still a few miles from the nest spring. Overall, tho, an awesome and blessed day.","Laural River

26.4 mile day, our highest yet. Wasn’t supposed to be this long of a day. The goal was to get to Abingdon Gap Shelter, about 16 miles. Ranger was up before Snoopy and I . He hit the trail about 7, we got got everything packed up and shoved off about 8. The trail was a muddy mess from all of the rain last night but it had stopped raining just before we started hiking. Kinda just the light mist/smoke/fog that this area is famous for. We made decent progress. Saw two “Platinum Blazers”, that I’ll call Tazer and Blazer b/c I can’t remember their trail names. I first met them in Hot Springs then saw them again at Mountain Harbour. They are a pair of nice older gentleman, who have been slackpacking for the last few weeks. On crappy wx days they just do a couple of miles. They use shuttle drivers to get where they want to be dropped off and picked up and have a warm shower, meal and bed every night. If it sounds like I’m jealous that’s because I am! They are called platinum blazers bc they don’t care how much they spend on shuttles and lodging in order to hike the trail their way. And they are working their way North but day hike most sections Southbound. Anyway I finally ran into them on the trail! I few miles later we came across a family of 4 doing a LASH, (long bootie section hikes) Damascus to Erwin. They were all spread out so it was cool talking to each of them in turn as we passed by. 


Here at the hostel it is Timber and his little dog kinda running the show and only one other hiker, a German guy named Heilderburg .I had heard about him but we finally caught him. 
Didn’t have a chance to look around town much bc of the late-ish arrival. Did grab some chips and ice cream at a gas station! Once again, a shower, clean clothes , hot food, a cup of tea. Life is just grand. Found a cool book to read too about a gal hiking the Wonderland trail.","Iron mountain

Woke up early, made a cup of tea and then Snoopy and I were out the door at 7 to check out Damascus. It had rained overnight but was just a fading drizzle as we set out. Found the dog park and let Snoopy run around but no one else was there at that early hour. Walked for a while on the VA Creeper trail (more on it later) , past the pool (outdoor, so not open yet) back to where we came into town yesterday. Checked out all of the storefronts along Main Street and read a bunch of historical markers. Found the Mill. Then while waiting for the dollar general to open (only place on this side of town for groceries) ran into Piñata! It was great to catch up with her. After we grabbed some eggs cheese and other trail food, the Post Office had just opened so we went and picked up a very heavy pckg that Angie had mailed earlier in the week. Then we took all of our loot back to the hostel to make breakfast, see what we have in the box from home and load up the pack! All of those chores took till about 10:30. There is a fairly strong wind advisory (gusts to 40-50 mph) and one of the other hikers decided to take a zero day bc of it but I wanted to get back on the trail. As we made our way out of town we ran into a hiker couple that told me to go say hi to Crazy Larry (a trail legend) so we popped into his house and made his acquaintance. One more quick stop at an outfitters for another freeze dried meal or two and we were back in the woods. The afternoon started out nice but the weather soon deteriorated. The trail starts climbing up a good sized hill/mountain and I wish I would’ve counted how many switchbacks there were on the way to Saunders shelter, at least 20-25, I bet. By the time we got to that shelter, it was blowing pretty good, but not yet raining so all of the dry leaves were getting whipped up by the wind. I kinda liked it but Snoopy wasn’t having as much fun. He gets nervous about that kind of stuff. So we pushed on. On the way down the hill we passed two hikers and with a lab. I wanted to talk to them about their travels but the wind was so strong, we just could barely hear each other while yelling. It was only 6.5 miles to the next shelter but the rain started falling. Just mildly at first but it soon was a drencher. The AT parallels the Creeper trail for quite a while . It’s nice to walk on a wide bike path (former railroad) instead of the one foot wide, trail sliced into the edge of a hill, roots, rocks, mud whatever, like so much of the trail has been. Anyway, when we finally got to this shelter (Lost Mountain) we’ve never been happier to find a dry place to duck into. As soon as I took off my pack, bam, thunder and lightning, rain blowing sideways… it’s a couple of hours later after setting up beds, eating dinner, looking over the guide for tomorrow’s itinerary, etc. and the rain still hasn’t let up. I doubt anyone else will be joining us at this point. No cell service and I can’t even get the Garmin to find service in this storm. Hopefully this storm system will flush everything out tonight and tomorrow will be clear. But we have bellies full of town food, a pack full of groceries and goodies and a dry place to sleep.

We got up and ate breakfast with C&A , the college couple that camped nearby. It was probably only about 35 degrees out so it was difficult to get out of the sleeping bag & get moving! But a nice cup of tea provided by Cooper certainly helped. Hitting the trail means warmth by movement and a big uphill push to chestnut flats on Iron Mountain certainly helps get the blood pumping (and me sucking wind for more oxygen!) Stopped up there for 2nd breakfast and to pound more water. The trail is in much better condition than yesterday. The ground has finally dried out and my socks/shoes didn’t get wet all day. Met zero hikers but passed by two separate trail maintenance crews. We thanked them for their service to making/keeping the trail safe and enjoyable to hike. Snoopy got a thorn in his back left paw. He lay down and let me look him over till I found and removed it. He’s no worse for wear but this old dog needs a bath! I’ll try to do that next time we stop at a hostel. We were originally planning on doing about 17-18 miles and then camping but one of the maintenance guys told us that the next shelter is close enough to a road and a town that you can get food delivered right to the shelter so we pushed on! Got here about 6pm and sure enough, just a 1/10 of a mile away is a forest service visitor center with a phone (I have no cell service here). We called a couple places and found some gf options so we ate a burger , fries and salad (Snoopy got the bun and left overs) that were delivered right to us! As we are laying here in the shelter (just us, no other hikers) I can hear both of our tummies rumbling and digesting all of the good-but-not-for-you food! Pretty sweet deal. Oh, this happened too: on occasion my trekking pole will get stuck , like on a rock or root or something while we are in stride , and sometimes I can pull it out, no big deal, other times we have to back up so I can withdraw it at the same angle it went down at… anyway today that happened at the same time that Snoopy lunged at a bird or something on the trail and it kinda twisted my back awkwardly. One hand being on a stuck pole and the other being yanked by a dog that has a much stronger “pull” than his size would let you believe. Nothing crazy but I’m sore in a different way than I have been yet (with all of the aches and pains my old body has felt over the last 5 weeks I didn’t even know a “new” soreness was possible!) I’ll watch it and hopefully it’s nothing a good sleep on a blow up pad in a cold shelter won’t fix! Good night to all!","Old Orchard

Walked back over to the visitor center to see if they had an exterior plug in for my battery pack, no luck. But did run into Rerun & Irish, sobos who talked trail conditions, etc. Took our time packing up since I wanted to check out the inside of the visitor center and it didn’t open till 9. Still had some time to kill so we walked a little 1/2 mile loop trail around some fishing ponds. Had a nice conversation with the Forest Service gal manning the center. She printed off the wx report. We only had about a 17 mile day planned today, need to slow down these 20+ mile days… don’t want to get burned out! At the 2nd ridge we came to, just a mile or two from the shelter, we finally got good cell service so I hung out for a bit to talk to Abe and Angie. Abe’s working on plans for when he’ll join us on the trail. Finally, after 11 am started to hike for real! It was another nice day. Before too long we passed No Rush, the self proclaimed last of the ‘22-‘23 sobos. We traded stories for an hour or so , it really was a lazy morning! Got to a neat old one room school house, that is open for folks to look around. A nearby Settlement museum was closed. A few more miles and we crossed a railroad and then I-81, the trail kinda walks thru a trucker pull off/gas station. Got some more sunflower seeds, a bag of popcorn and a few other snacks before we were back in the woods. Hit the 1/4 mile done sign and soon after strung up the hammock to camp tonight.

Had a decent descent off of little brushy mountain then a good ascent up Walker mountain (aptly named). Met a group of 22 hikers on a 4 or 5 day school trip. They were planning on camping where we camped last night. The morning was nice and uneventful, some up/down but a lot of walking thru rolling farmland. Over lunch at Knot Maul shelter we met ‘06 thru hiker Lumbermack. It was great talking to him. The early afternoon was warm but around 3 it started cooling off.

The first bit of the trail is very exposed and we just couldn’t get warm.  I was wearing gloves but my fingers were loosing feeling. I had on every bit of clothing I had. Finally, we dropped down into a low spot (Walker Gap) but since this is the AT, we started climbing up into the wind again! It was another couple of miles of exposed ridges before we dropped 1500 feet and left the wind behind! Whew! The rest of the day as uneventful. Passed only one hiker, he he wasn’t interested in talking. Hustled to get to an outfitters shop that is right on the trail at us hwy 52, but it was closed.

While we stayed relatively dry in the tent, everything outside was soaked. Rolled up a soaking wet tent that added about 5 extra pounds to my pack weight. By the time we were hiking it was raining steadily again. One good thing about the rain is it makes ya move… no beautiful views to check out, no sitting to rest on a mossy rock, just keep your feet moving. So we made good time to a shelter where we finally took a break. Soaked shoes, damp shirt under my rain jacket and it was easy to get going again after we ate. Only passed one gentleman, who was removing trees that had fallen across the trail. Chatted with him a bit and then on to Woods Hole shelter to get dry and clean!

The coffee pot was set to brew at 6am so I got a cup, finished packing up and we were walking back to the trail at sunrise.  The wind was picking up as we came down the steep descent into Pearisburg. We found the Post Office, which was only open from 10-noon, so it was good that we didn’t sleep in! Got our box and then made our way to Angel’s Rest Hostel. Again, we are the only thru hikers here. Opened a can of pineapple that Angie had included in our box while we checked out the hiker box and made a list of what to accomplish today, We popped over to a grocery store to supplement the dog food and other goodies we got (including some gf Girl Scout cookies and doggie treats from Indy clan!).

It was a cold morning and the wind was still blowing so it was pretty slow going as we made our way across the New River and back into the woods. As we gained altitude the temperature kept dropping. Even though it was only 8.8 miles to the Rice field shelter, that’s where we stopped. I didn’t feel like we should push on another 12+ miles to the next shelter and didn’t really want to set up the tent in this weather. So I read for a while.

It’s not too high up here, only about 3500ft but it’s 16 degrees and the wind gusts are blowing ice chunks off of the trees. They are crashing down on top of the shelter roof and Snoopy doesn’t like it! I tentatively planned out the rest of this week, and since the weather doesn’t seem like it is going to get much better, we plan to just do between 12-15 mile days , stopping at shelters each night. That way we won’t feel rushed. The ice covered trail is slick, especially the rocky areas. We will just take our time the next couple of days! Good night to all!","Rice Field

C B,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660876,"Tuesday 3/14. 6 weeks on the trail. Another chilly morning but we stayed warm all night. I sure appreciate my zero degree rated sleeping bag and insulated pad. Snoopy has a foam sleeping pad with a synthetic blanket on it and then I wrap him up in a down quilt so he stays plenty warm and comfortable too. He gets up and ready to go way faster than me. He just needs a stretch and a shake and he would be happy to get moving. Unfortunately he needs to wait the 1/2 hour or so that it takes me to fold everything up and repack the bag before I’m ready. He’s not a big eater first thing in the morning but I like to get a granola bar or something in me. I usually shove another one in my pocket to eat on the go too. I do like to stop and feed him though, usually within a couple of hours of when we start. He’s ready to eat once he’s burning calories on the trail. We were plowing thru a couple of inches of snow for the first couple of miles today, actually probably the first 5. It was slow going with all of the recent blown down trees we need to pick a path around. Luckily the trail is well marked here, lots of blazes to help keep us straight. As the trail finally started to head downhill I felt like I should be skiing, instead of hiking . I have the poked, just need a pair of skis! After only about 1000 ft of descent, tho , the snow really thinned out. After 8.8 miles and over 2200 ft of elevation loss we reached the next shelter and the sun was even out a little bit. But this is the AT, so what’s at the bottom of a hill… your next up hill!
Did a total if about 15.5 today and it felt good. We found on old hay barn to stay in tonight. It’s still cold, snowing and our water bottles are frozen but it’s warm enough here for us and this weather has got to break soon. We did pass a couple with a dog this afternoon. Willow thru hiked the AT a few years back and her hubby, Kelly and her do trail maintenance now. It was good to talk trail with the both of ‘em. And a big thanks to them for taking our trash. That’s about a pound less weight in my pack.","Bailey Gap

Got up at first light. This barn stood thru another night. Snow was filtering thru the wall boards all night but it was as good as a trail shelter. I learned that when we get into the Shanendoa NP next park next week, shelters are what they call day use picnic structures and huts are what we can stay in overnight. They are swapping up the terminology on us! Passed a huge old oak tree this morning on the ascent to the ridge we hiked all day. The sun finally pushed thru the clouds and although it doesn’t have a lot of heat behind it, it definitely helps lift the spirits to be hiking in sunshine! 
Came down off of the ridge in the early afternoon and who was filling up a water bottle at the creek but Cayenne! I haven’t seen him since day 3 or 4. We hiked the rest of the pm together and are now sharing a shelter with another guy, AAron, who is doing some sobo section hiking getting ready to do the Continental Divide trail next month. Seems odd after having shelters to ourselves for so long to be sharing with two people. Good catching up with an old friend tho and hearing about what’s coming up on the trail. And so nice to be in the sun most of the day. It’s still cold (below freezing rn) but we have much to be thankful for.","Old hay barn

Cayenne is an early riser. He probably hit the trail around 6. Snoopy and I got up around 6:30. Hit the trail around 7. The section hiker in the shelter, Aaron, hadn’t stirred yet when we left. This day brought some really cool sections to hike. First up was a section of trail called the sawtooth because it’s just these 10-15 little rocky ridges we were scrambling up, then down, up down. It only lasted about two miles but my legs were screaming! That section of trail concluded with a huge rocky outcropping called dragons tooth (see above pic). Then it drops down to a parking area, and since it was a beautiful sunny day, a few day hikers passed us on their way up. Around lunchtime the trail crossed a road (VA 624) and I noticed there was a gas station about 1/2 mile off trail so Snoopy and I detoured and picked up a cup of coffee and some snacks ( I was out of sunflower seeds!) Back on trail, we passed thru some farmland and another road crossing and then started climbing up to the most photographed spot on the AT: Mcafee knob ( see pic on 3/14). It was breathtakingly beautiful (and busy!) Lots of folks out enjoying the view and weather. We ended up in a shelter just 1/2 mile past McAfee knob with a SoBo, Leaf. He was full of good information about places to check out up north and assured us that the best of the trail is yet to come. Hard to believe after such an awe inspiring experience today!","Pickle branch

Woke up to a gorgeous sunrise right outside the shelter, the sky slowly changing from hues of pink to orange to red and then, bam- suns up. We continued talking to Leaf as we packed up to hit the trail. Yesterday from McAfee knob we could see the ridge line we’d be on most of today. It wrapped around to the South and then turned North and eventually the trail was taking us right along a section called Tinker cliffs with more awesome views down into the valley and back toward everything we scrambled over yesterday. Just phenomenal! Another ridge line walk brought us views of a lake to the East before we began a long descent into a pair of towns: Daleville and Troutville. Snoopy and I got down into town about 2:30 and our first stop was a BBQ joint. Great lunch (St. Paddy’s day specials) and then a stop at an outfitter to replace my worn out trail runners and grab some hiker meals then a grocery store to top off the shopping! Much thanks to a sweet trail angel, Katherine, who gave us a ride back to the trail head and made it so we didn’t have to cross a fairly busy 4 lane hwy, frogger style! We were out of the towns and back into the woods about 4pm for a push uphill the last couple of miles to a shelter with a cistern! I read it was the last one left on the trail. Reminds me of our house in Ketchikan, where most homes had cisterns. We made good time up despite the cold and wind. Just us here tonight but another great day to be on the AT!","Campbell

Getting excited to see Abe and Cay. Not sure when we’ll meet up but Snoopy and I plan to stay near road crossings tonight and tomorrow so that we can be ready to meet up with them fairly easily. We made good progress today. About 23 miles to a campground. Still cold when we arrived at about 4pm, the sun just didn’t have much heat in it today. But the campground has a little store with a grill so we got some nachos, French fries and a shake! Sprayed all of our gear down with a bottle of tick killer treatment and let it air out before setting it up. On the trail, we met both a nobo and a SoBo today. Both gentlemen started their hikes last year and circumstances took them off trail but they are back to give it another go! The SoBo is Laptop, can you guess what he is carrying in his pack? I didn’t catch the nobo’s name but he ended up at the same campground, but he got a cabin. We pitched the tent in the lee of some trees but the wind picked up overnight and really rocked the tent. We also made a fire since there was a nice fire ring. We haven’t had a fire for probably a week or two now. Met some of the other campers (rv/ trailer) and went to bed.","Fullhardt knob

Woke up to a windy morning at the campground. Packed most of our things up and then went and took a shower. The water was hot and plentiful. Decided to do a quick South bound slack pack so after breakfast Snoopy and I emptied out most of the gear from the pack and road walked up the AT access north of where we came out of the woods yesterday. It was only a few miles back to Middle Creek Campground Rd where we packed up the gear we’d left and then downhill to a motel where we will spend the night.","Middle Creek

Had a great night at this little motel. It was clean, spacious and comfortable. Got a bath last night and a shower this morning. This place is lacking a few things, however: no Wi-Fi, no microwave in the room, no coffee in the room or at the checkout desk! But I grabbed a cup of joe at the gas station down the hill and nursed it while we walked the 3-4 miles into the small town of Buchanan. Not much was open when we arrived but the library was welcoming and had a coffee pot. So we spent some time there talking with some locals and helping finish a jigsaw puzzle. After a couple of hours we wandered over the dollar store and grabbed a few things. As we were making our way back to the main part of town Abe called so we met Cay and him at the town park. We discussed the plan for the day while Abe and I repacked our bags. The day turned out to be pleasant and warm after the morning wind died down. About 2pm, we drove off to park the Prius about 100 miles up the trail then we all loaded up in Cay’s car to get dropped off where Snoopy and I ended our hike yesterday. Abe’s pack is not too big but super tall. He is still figuring out the best way to pack it and distribute the load, etc. We hiked about 5 miles to Cornelius Creek shelter and called it a night! It’s so nice to finally be on the trail with Abe.
Abe- Monday, March 20th, 2023Procrastinated on packing my bag, classic. My partner isn’t happy with me, it’s taken too long for me to pack, unpack, and pack my bag again. My back hurts from leaning over and shuffling over the same macaroni to the corner, then back to the middle, back to the corner. “Should I even bring the macaroni noodles?” I ask myself. Turns out, the jet boil system doesn’t like holding a rolling boil for too long. Ends up being 2 bucks a boil, that’s some spendy macaroni. Not even Mac and cheese, I forgot the cheese powder at homeThe night ends finally with me rolling into my partners late at nite, 1-2 am. We wake up at 7 to get to Virginia as quickly as possible. The original alarm was for 5 but after the alarm handoff (we have been practicing), we ended up finally leaving. I smash some 5 day old meatloaf, don’t worry it passed the smell test, and have a cup of joe. “let’s roll” I yammer to my partner, who is infinitely more prepared the. I am, and I have a 40 pound backpack. 
We take two cars up north, playing race cars all the way up I-26. We didn’t stop for pals for once. I am chugging water, trying to rehydrate just a smash more before heading on the AT (Appalachian trail.) That translates into me peeing, often. I eventually just start pissing in bottles in the car to save time. 
Finally, we get there, Buchanan, Virginia. It’s a Monday but a practical ghost town. We grab my dad, chuck, and head north after a quick gear shake down. I ended up borrowing a fleece from my partner, lady clothes look good on me, repackaging food into small ziplocks, and downloading an episode of my favorite podcast. 
After dropping the other car off, we hit the trail.  My legs are tired immediately. We only did around 5 miles but it’s mostly uphill. At the peak of the last mountain was one of the most unbelievable sunsets I have been seen, my dad looks accustomed but the pure wonder that beautiful dying light sheds on even an ugly mug like mine, is mind boggling. Finally, we set up in Cornelius creek shelter. I am so appreciative to be out here. I have some planter fasciitis I’m working out, so lots of before and after massaging was necessary. It feels good overall. Feeling bad about slowing down dads pace, I find myself apologizing too often. I need to work on that, and my breathing, and get rid of this gut. But, it’s all new and exciting! From the camp set up, bear hang, cooking with the jet boil, journaling, the mice skittering around, peeing anywhere, the list goes on and on. Lots of fun. My shoulders are just sore, Crashing hard, I tell my dad I love him. Day one done","3 level shelter

I knew Abe had a full few days leading up to his getting caught up to Snoopy and I so we slept in till about 8 this morning. He’s packing a camp stove so it was great to have a hot breakfast! The plan for today is to just walk as far as feels right. After only a couple of miles there was a side trail that led to some waterfalls, so we decided to check it out. Beautiful! Got back on the AT around noon and made pretty good time the rest of the day. Passed a family of 5 out enjoying the day and then later a very encouraging older couple. Abe’s sore but doing great! I’m excited to see what tomorrow brings! Abe-• Tuesday, March 21st, 2023 It was hard to sleep last night. Not sure if it was nerves or nerves. Kept drifting then reawakening, rinse and repeat. The hammock is hard to get out of, my legs are already busted. But, it was incredibly comfy. No complaints here. Wake up, make some eggs. They boil over and get everywhere, good thing we have a dog to clean up those messes. And we’re off. 
Trail starts slow and I appreciate that because I am starting to feel blisters coming in. Then we kick it into high gear for a 1,500 or so foot climb. My body isn’t ready got all that, I find myself taking a water break every 1/8th of a mile. Feels pretty pitiful but my body is facing the music of the trail. Dad is quick as lightening compared to me. We meet on the “top” (it’s actually one half of the way there) and make a few phonecalls. It’s nice to hear my partners voice, sounds like an angel after that hill. 
A few more miles of simple up and downs, foot   starting to throb now. One more peak, highcock knob, and a 1 mile decent to the bottom. I rip my boots off and can barely move today. I’m starting to feel doubt creep into my mindset. Food was good and it’s always nice to chat before bed. Dad mentions something about pissing off the mountain, I told him that’s not very novel. He’s starting to re-tell stories already but I don’t mind. Sleep well outside of some midnight leg cramps. Pretty much cowboy camping, Need to drink more water.","Cornelius Creek

Cold mnt, hog camp gap, big bald rock wall fences ad astra and two two other sobos/ flipfloppers. 
Woke up refreshed after hammock camping . Not in a rush today, just going to see how far we get. 
Talked to a ham radio operator at Matt’s Creek Shelter while we ate lunch. He had a lot of knowledge and knew the history of this area. It was cool talking with him. Passed over James River on the longest foot bridge of the entire trail. It was very pretty. Got to John’s Hollow shelter and still had some daylight and energy left it the tank, but I told Abe to make the call whether to continue or stay. He said he was alright so we put in a couple of more miles on a big uphill push onto Big Rocky Row. Passed a SoBo who had a sweet camp. We found a not as nice spot further on and set up. We were all tired and ready for bed!Abe-Little bit of up, whole lot of down, then more up. My blister is MAD the whole way down the mountain. I’m debating on popping it but aren’t sure on how well it will heal. It’s either in a crusty sleeping bag or in a soaking with sweat shoe. I decide to keep the blister around. We stumble into a cool police looking gentleman with one arm. I take a dookie and we (dad and I) both got a Virginia history lesson from the guy communicating with the Italians. Eventually we roll up on the longest walking bridge on the AT, not as exciting in person as I had hoped, a nice treat nonetheless. We pound up a few more miles ofThe mountain, meet a couple frat boys on the trail, and call it quits about 4,000 feet up. I lay in my hammock immediately, I’m pooped.

Beautiful cloudy morning greeted us as we woke up. A quick nobo-er, ET, passed us as we were breaking camp. He left Springer on Feb 23rd. !
 One big push up (~2000 ft elevation gain) then mostly downhill after that. We crossed over the BRP again after not seeing it yesterday. Our travels took us across a cool suspended bridge and then along a reservoir for a couple of miles. Abe is holding up well. He does have a blister on one of his pinky toes. But he’s bandaged it and it doesn’t seem to be bothering him too badly. The day ended with a small ascent to Brown Mt shelter. It’s a pretty little spot, with a creek babbling in the background. We made a fire in the fire pit and then went and soaked our feet and rinsed out some of our clothes. Hung them up to dry and made dinner. It’s just us in this shelter. We talked till about 9pm and now we are ready to sleep. It’s the warmest day so far, 70+ degrees today and only supposed to get down to 50 tonight. Good night!Abe-Thursday, March 23rd, 2023Wake up To “E.T” flying by our campsite around 8am. He has been clearing 30 mile days since the last days of February, Impressive. All downhill this AM, my feet are not happy with me. A symphony of “ows” is rolling through my head as we stomp down the hill. It’s gorgeous today, got up to the 80s. Dad and I push through a couple of decent sized hills in the sunshine with some wonderful views. While shuffling down the hill on my toes, a SOBO biker named “pink hotdog” was cruising up the mountain. Didn’t catch the story behind that one. Maybe it is best not to know. Our decent ended at ANOTHER suspension bridge, I ripped my feet out and let them dry out In the sun, crushed another tuna packet, and filled up waters. I’m hoping my feet are able to sustain the journey, they haven’t failed me yet but I’m really not sure. They seem to be weak at times, blistery etc etc. I get up and we continue up hill. As the sun beams; the mountains flatten out into a gorgeous creek where an old community used to exist, The park Service took the area over in the early 20th century. This led us to “Brown creek Shelter,” we made a fire and soaked our feet in the river. It was a wonderful grove that I would love to visit again. I’m SO sore but am so glad to be here.

Woke up to a nice morning. The sky had some light cloud cover. Our wet clothes that we had hung out to dry were still a bit damp so Abe tied off a couple of pairs of socks to the back of his pack. We hit the trail about 8. The day began with a 2500+ ft ascent over the first 4 miles… just up, up, up. We were rewarded with some amazing views from Bald knob and then some even better ones 2-3 miles later from Cole Mnt. We met some day hikers near the US 60 crossing and they gave us some granola bars and oranges! Fresh fruit is always such a treat on the trail. A big thanks to them. Most of the rest of the day was either slightly downhill or flat so we made good time in the later afternoon. The water sources are getting more spread out. The last two days I’ve had to take 1mile+ detours off trail to top off the water bottles. But you do what you need to in order to stay hydrated. We are now at  Seeley-Woodworth Shelter. There was another nobo here when we popped in, Mouse Killer. His thru hike was cut short last year due to a number of soft tissue injuries so he just got back on trail 4-5 days ago. It’s always nice to talk trail with a fellow hiker. He lives in GA now but is originally from upstate NY and has lots of trail experiences. I’m looking forward to stopping at a little store tomorrow and supplementing my food bag with some needed snacks . Supposed to be a wet one tomorrow so it may be a short day for us… guess we’ll see what tomorrow brings!Abe-Friday; March 24th, 2023Hills hills and hills. These HILLS. I cried a touch this morning. Felt good to cry off a mountain and drown my self pitying tears with stark Virginia beauty. I’m finally finding somewhat of my stride. It’s a little Jenky and SLOW but I am happier with how I am moving. Go up a hill, go down, get water, go up another hill. I’m gracious for the company because good lord I’m starting to go crazy, I hope my brain can make it. Coles peak was gorgeous, wide open views ranging from the plains of VA to the rest of the Appalachians. Stopped for some lunch and discussed what tuna tastes like..

Woke up to rain. Decided to take an easy AT trail day, less than 7 miles to the next shelter. We did add an additional 4 miles, however, by going to restock a few items at a small general store. We ditched our packs for the side trip so our backs got a nice midday break. The rain didn’t last all day but it didn’t really clear up till almost sunset. The shelter we stayed at is just below he summit of Priest mountain. It’s a tradition to write down one (or more) of yr “trail sins” in the shelter journal. I can’t repeat some of the entries. Hikers are an odd bunch. Mighty Mouse killer joined us again. I was able to coax a fire out of the damp wood. So dinner was rice, eggs and hotdogs. I’d also bought a jiffy pop campfire popcorn pan with the handle and the he foil that expands. It was fun to pop that over the coals.Abe-
Saturday March 25th Had a fun day today. Did about two miles at 8am, cold and humid morning. Had a few blow downs on the trail but wasn’t too bad. A few ups and downs but pretty relaxed. I’m starting to feel somewhat in stride, legs feels stronger, I’m getting into a decent breathing pattern. I can do about 10 (as long as they aren’t horrendous) miles and feel alright. Those 15’s are still kinda rough. We decided to resupply at a local little mart in the small town of Montabello, VA. I picked up some ramen and assortment of other things. I had a splendid hot pocket and a vitamin water. 2 miles back uphill with our overpriced groceries, quick repack and we’re back off. A few hills here and there, then we head up to the priest. Found a gal who went by “tuff” 20 years ago when she went northbound. It was a nice chat, and her family seemed to enjoy the trails almost as much as she did. Once we get to the priest shelter, I don’t write a confession, I haven’t been on the trail long enough to garner one. We decide to call a short day today. We meet a few other guys on a weekend trip out here, one did the AT back in 2016. “Gold rush.” Mouse killer ends up back out here with us and it’s nice to have the company.

Woke up around 7 but we weren’t in a rush to leave the shelter. A couple of day hikers popped in and we chatted with them while we were packing up. Hit the trail about 8:30 and the day just kept getting nicer. Passed a steady stream of day hikers and a few longer section hikers as we did the long descent down Priest Mountain to the Ty river. Continued passing hikers into the afternoon while making our way up toward 3 ridge’s mountain. Stopped for lunch at a sweet little stream. Pushing on to Maupin shelter so it’ll be an almost 14 mile day today but a lot of up/downs. I slipped on a mossy rock while filling up water bottles and my right knee is a bit banged up. Nothing bad but I’m going to baby it for the rest of the day. 
On the initial push up from the valley, Abe, Snoopy and I kept leap frogging this older couple. Talked with them a number of times. They are regular hikers in this area. 
Never mind what I said about taking it easy on my knee. No possible way to baby my knee on the ascent up three ridges mountain… it just kept climbing and fairly steep and rocky. The climb finally ended and more spectacular views from the summit and as we were descending. Snoopy and I pushed ahead of Abe to get to the shelter first and started a fire, got dinner going , etc. It was a nice way to wind down after a challenging day. It’s about 9pm now and we’ve been in bed for about 1/2 an hour. Snoopy is snoring. And I soon will be too. Good night.Abe-Woke up with a sore back. Some early morning yoga knocked that out of me. Dad made some half burnt oatmeal for breakfast. Yum. Wrapped my toes in tape, chugged some water, Threw on the pack and got to going. Easy ascent, no blow overs for priest. Lots of day hikers out today as we trudged down the 4 miles of down hill. No SOBOS (south bound hikers on the AT) though. A little disappointed. My toes hurt on the downhill so I’m glad when we get down to the suspension bridge. It bounced a lot when I was on it, whee! Followed an old couple for a few miles then passed them near the stream crossing, stopped for a lunch of spam and pickles. Wasn’t a bad lunch. I decided to catch a quick Z at the creek for a few minutes so dad pushed ahead. This was one tough mountain, from rock slides to pick through, to vertical rock scrambles, this loop had it all. Dad went ahead and started the fire at camp before I rolled up, tired, around 6:30. We had a poor mans fried rice for dinner and decided to hit the hay early.

We have the longest mileage day on the trail, since Abe joined us, planned for today. So my alarm went off at 6:30. It’s just starting to get light out at that time. Made a big breakfast of dehydrated eggs and oatmeal. Hit the trail around 8. The day starts out with a decent ascent and then a descent. Then is mostly flat for about 5 miles before another push up to Humpback Mountain. Then a relatively long drop to the shelter. The trail is a lot less busy than yesterday. In the afternoon though, we did met Ricky, a flip flopper who started in HF on 3/15. He’s Going strong, fixing blisters on trail. Got to the shelter about 6pm. There was enough light left for us the explore the creek and soak our weary feet before we made dinner (Mac and cheese for Abe, mashed potatoes and beef jerky for me, Snoopy always helps us out with finishing it all!) . Then we did some planning for our in town resupply day tomorrow. Just 5 miles to where the car is parked at Rockfish Gap.
Abe- 
Got some decent rest last night. I have been fortunate enough to rig up my hammock in the shelters because we have been the only sleepers in there. I like the hammock because it de-compresses my spine I’m the middle of the night, which is HUGE when I’m wearing the pack all day. Been having these bizarre dreams recently, I’ll wake up and tell dad about them. Last night was about this previous college fling who ended up being a zombie, she was dead to me anyhow. We started pummeling along today and saw some interesting scenery; A ski resort shut down for the year that was operating a golf course instead, some “cuts” in the mountains which ended up being glacial rock spilloff, and the “humpback rocks.” These were massive rocks that stuck out the side of the mountain making you feel on top of the world once you were on them, and had an over 270 degree view of the beautiful Virginia valleys below. By the end of the day I was a little grumpy and foot sore but we happened into a really nice shelter, the “Paul Wolfe ” Caught a crawfish, soaked my feet, ate some dinner, and HIT the sack.

Wolfe Shelter to Waynesboro (Rockfish Gap) is only4.9 miles so an easy day today. But we accomplished quite a bit. The hiking was enjoyable and flat with a couple of neat things to look at over those miles; an old cemetery, some cabin ruins, a couple of pretty stream crossings.  Then a relief to find the car was safe and sound, parked just where we left it last week with Cay. We got to the car and drove about 20 minutes to a Costco in West Charlottesville. We ended up buying a bunch of big bags of dried fruits, nuts, chocolate chips, granola, etc. along with some other essentials like peanut butter, crackers, chips , jerky & cheese.  We also got a rotisserie chicken and some salad and put those together for a great quick lunch in the parking lot. We then drove back to Waynesboro and checked in at the Hostel. Showers and laundry were followed by more snacking while we combined all of the dried ingredients to make a bunch (probably 50!) of baggies of homemade trail mixes. We then drove over to the local visitor center and got our questions about entering ShenandoahNP answered, followed by a trip to the local outfitters for some more shopping. We also hit the local brewery. Back to the Hostel where I threw some gf Costco pizzas in the oven while Abe caught up on phone calls and other chores and Snoopy enjoyed playing with the two other dogs that are currently here. We had been informed of a local history talk being offered at a theatre nearby so we walked over and enjoyed listening to that. On the way we stopped by a local ice cream bar. Then back to the hostel for clean up and organize everything for tomorrow’s adventures. We are all clean, smell way better than we have in the last week and happy to be in soft beds while a light rain started falling as night approaches.Abe- Easy day, we marched our little booties 5 miles out of the wonderful shelter we stayed at until we got to the car. It was such a blessing getting to DRIVE around. The woods make you more appreciative, I believe. We took a Costco run, I got a hotdog and a coke. Dad bought some ingredients for homemade trail mix. Costco sized trail mix. We ended up making about 50-60 baggies of trail mix in total. Whew. We stayed at a hostel for the night, $22 a person. I think dad spent more on one bag of granola today at Costco. After plugging things in, showering, hitting the outfitters, grabbing a beer and reconnecting with loved ones we had some extra time. We walked downtown, got some ice cream, and watched a historical telling of the life Caleb Brighton. Interesting stuff. I think we were the only people under the age of 60 in the whole theatre haha. The hostel guys were a little bored and wanted some company by the campfire but we were too preoccupied with little town chores. I get to sleep in a bed tonight!","Paul Wolfe shelter

Hiking with a car is different. As we entered the Shenandoah NP I dropped Abe off at the Appalachian trailhead and then Snoopy and I drove about 12 miles up to a parking area that the trail crosses and parked. I tossed a few things into a small backpack and we started South. Passed Abe a few hours later at a big old field, ate some lunch together there while we talked about trail conditions and passed off the keys and then we continued South while he hiked to the car. We did pass one couple going Nobo and also taking this week to get thru SNP, Juan Valdez and Corncob. I’m sure our paths will cross again. After Snoopy and I exited the park on foot, we turned around (Snoopy looked at me like, “what are we doing… we just came from there?!?”) and entered it again, this time stopping to fill out the hiker back country permit at the kiosk set up along the trail. The paperwork wants you to guess (or plan… WHAT!) where you’ll be sleeping each night so I wrote down some of the shelters (huts, they are called in SNP) and filled out the rest of the form to the best of my ability. Abe met us at a roadside pull out and we decided we had enough energy for another couple of miles so we drove a little farther than where we started/Abe stopped and did the Northbound/Southbound crossing key swap again. This is really cool for a couple of reasons: 1. a light day bag! My shoulders are getting a break. 2. Each of us not only gets to hike the AT but we each get to drive the Skyline Drive through out the entire length of the Park. Both offer unlimited but different views and experiences 3. Reuniting at different points throughout the day so we can share our experiences and pass on advice. 
Anyway, at around 5pm we decided to call it a day. We had hiked past the first hut so we drove to the closest parking area near the next one (Blackrock) and grabbed/loaded up our big packs and made the almond one mile trek to the next one where we met a couple of Sobos (Moxie and Wild Boar) that were already posting up for the evening. Great conversation and  a weird dinner combination of gf dehydrated steak and mashed potatoes and sardines and we slept soundly.
Abe - 
Dad made a wonderful breakfast of pancakes. He’s so sweet, similar to the 3 year expired maple syrup we had on our corn pancakes. They tasted more like sweet tamales, no complaints. We head up to rockfish gap to start our journey into Shenandoah. Today is the first day of our “flip flopping.” Essentially, one of is dropped off wherever we had left off the hike previously, the next person drives a while until a good parking area near the trail, and starts hiking south. Once the two of us meet, we switch keys and continue in this way. I get dropped off first and start the chilly climb into the park. It starts rocky for the first few miles but gets more and more graded as I go along, allowing me to move a touch faster and less hesistant. Dad hands off the keys to me around the midway point. I meet an older gentleman named Abe who hiked the AT between 1969 and 1987, cool guy. About a half mile past us meeting, I run into 6 different blow downs, how annoying.  Have a nice phone call with Cay, it’s great to hear her voice, makes my day a little better. We  meet up, and decide to do a few more miles until we total around 15 or so. We skip ahead to blackrock shelter and hike about a mile in for the night. Meet up with “moxie” and “wild boar” at the shelter and share some stories. Dad decides to make mashed potatoes and sardines. I don’t recommend it. It was a chilly but fun evening.","Rockfish Gap

I sweat up a storm regardless of the weather so I don’t pay too much attention unless it’s stormy or raining. The initial hike up the hill from our campsite sucked, steep and uneventful with my pink crocs on. The grip isn’t great on those water shoes. Hike the rest of the AT way up blackrock, then backtrack to the car, unload and start flip flopping again today. Passed a young pair named “Valdez and Corncob”, they were pretty cool, they had already met my dad previously. 
We did three sections today, one five, one 6, and one two. We had a Pretty long and earned day overall. Camped under the Stars at Doyle’s river, right underneath a cool cabin. Wilson slept in the hammock and went CRAZY at one point when we pulled a treat out. What a HOOT. We were lazy about our bear bags tonight, this may be my last entry.

We then did hiked together back to the car, where Abe unloaded his sleeping gear from his pack and continued South while Snoopy and I drove South to where we left off the previous day and began hiking north. We surprised Wild Boar and Moxie when we crossed paths with them again! It does take a bit more planning to hike this way but we’ll make sure that we hit all sections of the trail as we make our way north through the SNP. The weather these last two days has been cool and clear, perfect for hiking and the trail has been in relatively good shape. Our travels took us past two closed campgrounds today and our first Wayside, a small souvenir/gift shop/convenience store, also closed:( 
Not too much traffic or hikers on the trail today. Snoops and I only stopped to yak with one other person all day!

Being that it’s April 1st, there was also a lingering thought that the advertised hiker feed was just someone’s idea of a sick April Fool’s joke. But we did our short section in the rain, dried off in the car as best we could and set out to look for the green Suburban with a roof rack at the campground. We found the host, a pleasant and generous fellow, named Truck stop. Another thru hiker, Inferno, was helping him set up. We offered to lend a hand too but Truck stop just started cooking for us. The first plates were chicken fajitas. More hikers showed up. More food came off the grill. Soon the blustery fire was surrounded by Corncob, Juan Valdez, Magilla gorilla & Broomhilda, inferno, Whooby and us all swapping stories while Truck stop kept putting food in our laps… bratwurst, deer steak, chicken, I think even some bear meat was consumed along with a variety of beverages, chips, fruit and many other snacks.

Woke up after a cold night. Abe and I had swapped sleeping bags, with the hope that he’d be warmer in my quilt that is rated for 0degees but he said he was cold b/c he couldn’t get the cinch string closed up tight around him since he’s so big and tall. It should be warmer at nights soon so hopefully this issue will be resolved. We said goodbye to the friends that we’d made last night (Tom, the tattoo artist from Philly, Husky, the quick thru hiker and Allen, the  veterinarian who’s just out for the night . Soon after leaving camp we came across another 1/2 way marker. This one was cool so we took a few pics. We made great time on a relatively flat trail. We passed thru Pine Grove Furnace SP , where the AT museum is located but it was closed, as w is the general store where most folks do the 1/2 gallon challenge. We pushed on because about 8 trail miles further was another general store where the same challenge came be attempted year round. As we arrived we saw three other thru hikers just sitting down to start their challenge, too. We found out later that just 2 of them attempted it, the third got a sandwich instead. The little store was neat with some local goods in addition to the normal camping gear and junk food . In order to do a true 1/2 gallon challenge, you must buy a tub of ice cream and then an additional 1 quart to make up for ice cream portions getting smaller over the years. Hersheys is the brand in stock (duh?) , so Abe got a tub of banana pudding and a quart of Blueberry cheesecake while I got a tub of butter pecan and a quart of good old vanilla. I also got Snoopy a small tub of cool whip so he could join us. Ready , set go! Clicks ticking as we dig in … it was sunny but only about 45-50 degrees out so not ideal ice cream eating weather. But Abe finished his with about 7 mins to spare and I was licking the tubs clean with about 2 mins till the 1/2 hr timer was gonna sound. Snoopy was the quickest tho, we had his bowl licked clean in about 15 minutes!

We both slept well at the campground, but it was another freezing night. Ice on the bottom of my ground cloth. Luckily the morning sun has some good warmth to it and everything thawed out quickly before we packed up. We had a little ascent to the top of a mountain where the guide book said we’d see a rock maze. It was pretty cool , these big rock formations that the trail kinda wound thru and over. One of the areas had about a 4 ft ledge you had to pull yourself up onto and Snoopy took a standing leap and cleared that obstacle with ease. When we got some cell service I looked up rental cars so that we can go get the Prius from where we had parked it back in VA. Found a Hertz about 2 miles from the trail at an upcoming road crossing so I made a reservation and we hustled the last few miles to that road. After leaving Abe and dog at the trail I walked to the address but was surprised to find that Google maps sometimes lies! The rental agency had moved from that location a few years ago and was actually located about 8 miles away. An Uber got me to the right place on time and I picked up my trail companions and we drove off to find dinner! Stopped at a nice little brewery restaurant for some good grub before driving thru 3 states all the way back to trail mile 999.5 where we parked the Prius last week.

Weslept near Swatara Gap. I don’t think any of us slept very well. But at least it was a warmer night than the last couple have been. Snoops and I were awake at sunrise but didn’t really get moving till about 7. Around 8 we had the cars more or less “repacked” and I took Snoopy for a quick walk. We stumbled across a sign in the corner of the parking area that told us to call the park with a list of info if leaving a car parked overnight. So I did that and then we looked for a place to get breakfast. GPS took us to an Army base with a coffee shop/breakfast grill. It was good food at a good price. We then drove about another hour back to where we got off trail yesterday. I dropped off Abe and Snoopy and went to return the rental car. No issues there and a quick Uber brought me back to meet up with my hiking crew. A guy named Inferno passed Abe while I was gone but we caught up to him again soon enough. We first met him at the hiker feed way back in the SNP back on April 1st. He has less than 60 miles left before he’s finished with his hike. We made good time across the first couple of miles, which had the Trail meandering around neighborhoods and across fields. We came across a small farm with a little store selling milk, eggs, honey and some other goodies. It was pretty cool. I picked up a dozen eggs and a couple of Gatorades. We passed over I-81 (again) and soon arrived at Scott’s farm, which is and ATC area crew HQ. The buildings were all locked up but charging her phone was a gal we met about a week ago, Sarah, from Germany. She joined us hiking for a few miles. She stopped at Darlington shelter along with a couple of other hikers we met today. We pushed on a few more miles till we got to a nice camp spot along a babbling brook.

Michelle (slozy mosey). This was really cool. We were approaching a road crossing and there are dozens of day hikers all around us. All of a sudden I hear a gal yell “hey, are you CB?” “Uh… yup, how’d you know? “ I ask her back. “I recognize you from trail journals” she says. Turns out, she is a trail angel that looks for the thru hikers and she loaded us up with drinks and candy, all kinds of delicious snacks! Completely ignores the day hikers and just dotes on Abe, Snoopy and I. It was a real treat! Thank you Slowsy Mosly (Michelle).The trail is in good shape! A great day.","LA. Smith shelter

We met some kids playing at a park just across the state line (Delaware River) and they had great questions about being thru hikers, and loved on Snoopy. We also passed Sunfish pond, which is a neat( and unique) lake . I’ll try to put the sign pic on tomorrow’s entry. We ended up walking further than we had to to get to MOC (Mohican Outddor Center), where we camped and swam and got a shower.","Camp past Kirkridge shelter

Later in the day, we are all chugging up a hill when we hear someone calling out our names. It was our friends from SNP , who we first met at the hiker feed , gorilla and broomhilda ( now called hot feet, but that’s a crazy story). Anyway, due to some injuries, they skipped the worst of the rocky trail and bumped ahead of us. It was great catching up! Then, a bit later, we also caught up with team Ohio, who are Dessert Queen and Mr Rook. We ended up camping with them at muddy Brinks shelter. There were cool drawings in shelter journal . Ended up picking 30 ticks off Snoopy. He wasn’t happy with me at the end of the day but it’s necessary. Overall, A good day.","MOC

Met a couple of local hikers at Sunrise Mountain , who we talked with while enjoying lunch. Things are getting to be fairly routine as far as setting up/breaking down camp, making meals, etc. The days are never the same tho. Always something new to see, someone unique to talk with, etc. Thank you to whoever puts the water in the bear box at Mashipacong shelter. It was great!","Brink

I don’t know if I mentioned it in the journal but Abe (just Abe or JA) fell and his phone helped break his fall against a rock , so it was toast. Angie mailed a new one to a friend of hers that lives close to the trail so we went there . No phone but we got showers and lunch. Thank you so much, Nicole, for the hospitality. We pushed on a few miles and made it to the small town of Unionville, where we got some delicious ribs from the local watering hole. We ended up getting a rental car since we need to bump the Prius up closer to us anyway.

We got to this section of rock called the “lemon squeezer”, where as you walk up the trail, you just get pinched tighter and tighter till you have to kinda force yourself out of the slot and onto higher ground. It’s fun. Beautiful views. We are close to NYC but when you have views looking West you’d never know it… just green mountains/hills as far as the eye can see.","Fitzgerald falls

Had about a 3 mile hike toMahoosuc notch, which is considered the most difficult (I’d argue dangerous, but also fun) mile on the entire AT. It probably took us about 1.5-2 hrs to make it thru the 1.1 mile valley (notch or what they’d call a gap in the Southern area) . It was all a jumble of various sized boulders and you just pick yr way over, around or under as you see fit. We had the additional challenges of ice snow and running water . Beautiful though, as the mountain walls are sheer on either side of you as you make yr way thru the mess. A big up and little down brought us to Speck pond. A beaver has been busy reinforcing the dam and it was wet crossing the outfall but the shelter was a nice place to eat lunch. After that we had about an additional 7 miles, almost all descending to get to bald plate lean to , where we are currently cuddled up in bed.","Full Goose
