is drawing nearer.Â  The countdown clock on my desk is well into the double digits,
and my retirement papers are filed.Â  The official date
is not until June this year, but I've saved and rolled all my leave time in
order to begin the AT in April.Â  There is a part of
me that feels somewhat guilty leaving my career treating Veterans as a Physical
Therapist while I'm still abled-bodied and of somewhat sound of mind.Â 
However, after serving 26 years at the VA and four years in the Navy, I'm proud
to be concluding 30 years of federal service.Â  I'm using this dream of
hiking the AT as my reward (and challenge) of having a stable consistent
working career and fit enough at retirement to begin what many people feel is
an unstable decision. Ha.Â Â 
I was born and raised in Florida with my dad from Maine, and my
mom was from Massachusetts.Â  Nearly every summer growing up we would
travel from Florida to New England, sometimes by plane, but often by car or
camper.Â  On these trips perhaps in the smokies, or maybe the Blue Ridge
Mountains is where my mom introduced me to the Appalachian Trail pointing out a
sign and sparking my interest as she described the long trail.Â  Even
though as a kid and teenager I walked a mile or two on the AT at tourist areas
or road crossing, it really never hit me the extent and venture of the trail
until I was in the Navy.Â  My cousin who was just ending his enlistment
with the Marines came by my base and described his upcoming thu-hike adventure
he was about to begin.Â  Since that day, the spark to someday walk the
entire AT was set.Â  Life happened and thoughts of the trail were often dim
or extinguished from myÂ mind.Â  Â A few years ago, with thoughts
of my retirement around the bend, my wife and I searching for a movie to watch
on Netflix, stumbled onÂ A Walk in The
WoodsÂ  and the flame was
reignited.Â  I then knew what I wanted to do the minute I retire!",,View Entry,"Jan 26, Thu",0
bryan robbins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659985,"Living in the deep South, when the subject of my plans to attempt the AT thru hike the number one question is if I'm taking a gun.Â  ""You are taking a gun, right?"", ""Please take a gun!"".Â  The next question is if I'm going alone and then a perplexed look on their face when I describe the concept of meeting people on the trail.Â  I also am asked as they look me up and down ""are you training for this hike?"".Â  The truth is as a Physical Therapist I know I should have way more trail miles training under me than I currently do.Â  However, I also know of the concept the trail trains you, and plan to keep my miles low until I feel my trail legs.Occasionally, I will get proper questions like how much will your pack weigh, how many miles will you need to hike a day, where will your wife meet you, and where and when do you expect to finish?Â  Â If I happen to come across someone that has ever spent one or more nights in the woods, I may be then asked about the Big 3 (tent, bag, pack).Â  Someone will really get my attention if they ask what's my pads 'R' value or what type of bear bag I'm using.It's all ok, I enjoy being questioned about my upcoming hike.Â  I don't even mind as they walk away from our conversation and their shaking their head. It's something way out of the norm for most people to conceptualize, and to me that makes it that much better.",,View Entry,"Jan 28, Sat",0
bryan robbins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659997,"I have read posts, blogs, and interviews of hikers who have given deep and sophisticated answers to why they plan to thru hike the Appalachian Trail.Â  My answer of why isn't deep as I want to become more spiritual with nature or sophisticated as striving to reap the mental health benefits.Â  I believe both of those things are great and acknowledge they will be part of my journey.Â  I guess with me it's about the adventure.Â  Maybe it was those long trips as a kid or the exploring my cousins and I were always doing as a child.Â  Maybe it was my time in the Navy where I indeed saw many different ports, but also, when able, just enjoyed finding a quiet cove of a side deck watching the sea and horizon.Â  It seems I've always looked for new ventures.Â  I feel this poem of the original AT thru hiker strikes a chord with me and is so relevant as I do my best to chase Spring in a couple of months.A whisper comes in the dead of night When lonely stars are shining,The restlessness of a bird in flight From deep within me pining.From lonely seas to the mountains high Iâ€™ll roam the whole world over,A vagabond of the wind and sky, For I was born a rover.Earl Victor Shaffer",,View Entry,"Jan 29, Sun",0

The check in went well, and I felt better about my pack weighing 31lbs with food and water after seeing the 3 or 4 hikers before me having packs weighing 40+. Hiker # 2224, wonder if I can half that by Katadyn or maybe Harper's, ha. It was a great day, and I didn't feel guilty for slackpacking day zero, and enjoying these first few days with my wife at the Lodge.Â  I still have to get off trail right after the weekend and drive back home for my retirement day, then right back to the trail. Best part of the day: walking under the arch, mist of the falls, and touching the Springer mountain plaque at the AT southern terminus.Trailname: TBD","Amicalola Falls

bryan robbins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661783,"Day 1 mile 2- 8.5 ;7.5 mThe day started rough. We left the lodge in a fog and drizziling rain. Up to Springer mountain parking we went where I left the day before doing the approach trail and first mile of AT.Â  Minutes from Julie dropping me off on top of the mountain on a gravel rough road the truck alerted me of a tire going down. Within seconds it was completely flat and no cell phone service. Dear God thankyou i was still in the truck and julie was not alone.Â  After changing the flat julie dropped me off and she went to town to get some tires.Â  The hike was wet but smooth. I found a good pace and met several hikers. I walked a good bit with hiker Barley who got his name because he often hikes in a 12 pack of Coors Light.. :)...he offered,, and i passed...well until we were at the end of the days hike anyway..ha",,View Entry,"Apr 07, Fri",0

It wasn't a high mileage day, but gave me my first test on how I and my gear would do with the wet and cold.Â  These two things combined was my biggest fear coming in, but it went well today.Â  I go back now to finish my last days at work and return to the trail 4 days from now.

Stayed the night before in canton GA about hour and half shy of drop off point. Julie and Rachel did well with the gravel and no more flat tires. They picked me up that night and we went to amicalola lodge for the night. Still not in tent, but full pack on these miles.

 Rachel hiked with me today up blood Mountain. To me sassafras mountain the day before was tougher on the legs.
It was a short day and we finished right before the rain came and ,yes, I again stayed with the girls for one last night.

Day 8.
Mile 31.3 to 42.8 11.5 Mile hike
Drizzled most of the day. Tired and in my tent. Not many views except on on top of a mountain the skies cleared just briefly to get a nice photo. Then the rain again stopped when I finally got to camp, which made setting up my tent a little less messy. I'm finally in my tent, but I don't feel guilty one bit that up to thus far I've been platinum blazing the appalachian trail (look it up) ðŸ˜€",,View Entry,"Apr 14, Fri",0

Was one of the last out of the camp trying to effectively take down and load my went tent without making a mess Of everything in my pack.Â  Hiked that day with a guy trail named Weezy. He took that name over blisters I had called him after giving him some ointment for his feet.Â  I this day excepted my trail name ""P.T. Cruiser"".Â  I was going to wait to NC and let hikers vote on names I was kicking around but it was quickly seen case a Landslide.Â Â  My buddy Jerry gave me that name months ago, I was a little hesitant because not really wanting to advertise I'm a PT.Â  However, I like the fit and plan to keep it. Thanks Jerry.","

Day 10
Mile 50.1 to 59.8
The night in Blue mountain shelter area went well and was quicker getting packed up. Hiked over Tray Mountain which was 2nd highest peak so far on the trail ~4300 feet and I felt it. Several of us passed each other on the trail and enjoyed the short talks as we rested.. came across trail magic twice and it really helped the hiker hunger. These people who pull up to a trail crossing at some road on a mountain are really special people and I hope to pay it forward in future years. First time I ate sausage, bacon, and hotdogs on one bun.Â  I conversed alot with two retired military doctors along with Weezy. We went over Tray Mt. And went to a tent site to try to get some protection from the expected high winds and frigid temps. At this site we're 9 hikers, of whom 5 were Veterans. There were good talks by the fire. The Docs are only doing the Georgia section and another Vet and his daughter will be too fast for my current speed.Â  Weezy and I are also planning on going in to town for resupply soon",,View Entry,"Apr 16, Sun",0
