Hopefully we will be able to put down in words our Appalachian Trail “half-a”thru hike. With God’s Grace we’ll climb mountains and sleep under the stars, we will have plenty to eat and our backpacks won’t be too heavy, we’ll stay dry and we won’t stink, we will have only sounds of the forest but we won’t be lonely.  Please think of us often with prayers.

Cindy & Bill ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661967,"Hello All, sorry no entry for yesterday, no cell service. The weather was perfect. We hiked up and over Sassafras Mountain with a total of 7.6 miles. I will say the mountain was tough, it was hot and slow going. As we were coming into Cooper Gap, a trail angel left gallons of water for hikers to refill, this was our first trail magic and very much appreciated. We ended our day at Gooch Mountain Shelter. Tenting sites were full.  After we fell asleep some more trail magic showed up, pizza, beer, soda, snicker bars, oranges & apples and they took everyone’s trash (we still have our trash).Today up bright early. Another beautiful day. We were one of  the first to leave camp. Dad says that’s the way we meet everyone…when they hike right by us. And we did meet everyone. Hiked up and over Big Cedar Mountain for a view of mountains like we never saw before, for a tough 8.3 mile day. We are camped at Lance Creek listening to a hiker and his guitar for an end to our day.","Hooch Mountain selter

Cindy & Bill ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662027,"Last night we chose a really nice campsite at Lance Creek. Before setting up we took our boots off and cooled our hot feet in the creek. It felt amazing after a long day. One takeaway was no privy. This morning we had to dig our first cat hole. All went well except Dad wiped what he thought was dirt off the shovel with his hand.Today a planned shorter hike to prepare for the climb up Blood Mountain. The Georgia mountains are beautiful and high and need to be taken seriously.(I’m not sure if I mentioned but we started our hike with heavy packs, Dad’s 44 lbs mine 30.6 lbs. they have become just a tad lighter but because of the weight my right knee is sore. Dad offered to carry my bear canister to make my pack so much lighter. God bless him! And tonight my knee feels much better.)As we approached our planned destination to a campsite on trail the sky became dark and the wind started gusting. We quickly set up our tent and climbed in just as the raindrops started to fall. A little earlier that expected but another great day.","Lance Creek

Cindy & Bill ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662127,"We woke in the rain, we hiked in the rain and we set up in the rain. We climbed over dreaded Blood Mountain and descended into Neel’s Gap where the trail goes right through an outfitters store. This store is famous on trail because of the hiking boot tree. A large tree has boots hanging from every limb. Legend has it…it’s hikers who decided to quit the trail. We ate, charged our phones and resupplied. We met a hiker who flew in from England. We hiked another mile and set up camp.If anyone is curious the trail name I gave dad is “Shit Wipe” but it’s not sitting well with him.And dad insists on complementing me on hard work in drying out a wet tent before sleep.","Just north of Woods Hole Gap

Can I mention, the mountains in Georgia must be taken seriously. We hike up a mountain then down the other side again and again and again. At the top of the first mountain Dad allowed us to stop to have a cold oatmeal breakfast  (so I could finally take an aspirin for my achy knee and hike a little faster haha)The views from the mountain top are magnificent, the people are so friendly, and we experienced 2 trail magics today.","Bull Gap

Cindy & Bill ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662189,"We are so saddened that we were unable to make it to Mass today. We ended up no where near a road crossing on Saturday night. We woke up Sunday morning and watched St Anne’s TLM Perth. The hiker camping next to us asked what we were listening to, we explained we were watching Sunday Mass in Latin on YouTube. We must plan tomorrow for next Sunday. 


Today was somewhat of an easier day, we had no big mountains to climb, just a gradual increase and decrease of elevation and beautiful views.


Dad woke up today soaked in sweat, I felt sorry for him and even a little guilty. He said “it got so hot last night I’m soaked in sweat” I said “I know, I took off my wool top  layer and unzipped my 11 degree sleeping bag also took off my wool hat.” I looked over at him and he was still bundled up in his sleeping bag. 


And I woke up today with hiker hunger and Dad said “I told you, you should have had 3 hotdogs yesterday.”  We had our coffee and while packing up I wanted a snack. I had our last nutrition bar and I shared one bite with Dad. I inquired about breakfast shortly into our hike. Then an hour after breakfast I was wondering when we would stop for lunch. Then I remembered I had a pack of skittles in my Fanny pack, it’s all good for now. (We did have a tasty lunch)


Yet again we met many friendly people on the trail. Today it was Chris from Pennsylvania, a trail runner, he takes care of the trail and the people on the trail. Then it was Chaplain Steve (trail name) at the Low Gap Shelter, also from PA. He is retired and hops on the trail when life gets too noisy.


We are having a great time but we are definitely missing our family and friends. Also,  thanks everyone for your comments in the guestbook.In all thy ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct thy paths. PROVERBS 3:6","3 miles south of Low Gap Shelter

Cindy & Bill ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662294,"Short hike long day


It was today we had to go into town not tomorrow because after packing up and hiking 1 mile we stopped at Blue Mtn Shelter and I realized our road crossing into town was 2.5 miles down the trail. So I called for a shuttle and Gracie from hitch- a -hiker gave us a ride into Helen GA. ( the cutest little German town, and I just love the name). We resupplied, had lunch and headed out of town. Standing on the edge of town is Dad thumbing a ride for us. After about 5 minutes a pickup pulls over and a very nice gentleman offers us a ride 9 miles up the mountain to unicoi Gap. (My first time hitching a ride but not Dad’s)


By the way, since Dad’s trail name SW isn’t sitting well with him I gave him a new one…sort of. It is still “SW” but it stands for “Super Wonderful” and guess what?  He likes it!! BUT his trail name is really the former “SW” he just doesn’t know it. 


Again, everyday we meet new hikers, but we also bump into hikers we have met along the way and we get to learn more interesting things about them. One major thing we learned is that the hiking community is made up of all different people, young and old, from all over the world and we all work together to make everyone’s hiking experience the best it can be. This is America!!! God bless the USA.


Oh by the way, I was given a trail name today.  2 nights ago we were camping along the trail with 2 other hikers. Around 0330 I woke up and couldn’t stop laughing, I woke Dad up and I was trying to say what I was laughing about. The more I tried to be quiet as to not wake the other hikers, I just couldn’t stop. Well today I was given the trail name “giggles”by one of the hikers I woke. He says every time he sees me I’m laughing.


Tonight we witnessed a most beautiful sunset. We are usually in our tent before the sun goes down but tonight we were hanging out with a fellow hiker chitchatting.  “Barley” was a very interesting “old soul” his wisdom and conversation were very comforting. And the 3 of us watched the sun set then called it a night.


God bless all of you, we love you!

",On top of Rocky Mountain,"Apr 17, Mon",4.70
Cindy & Bill ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662314,"the only place we have to be is up the trail somewhere. 
We usually always know where we camped but never know where we are going. Everyone that passes us asks “where are you coming from and how far are you going?” Dad usually answers “ I don’t even know where we are.” 


We hiked up Tray Mountain from Indian Grove Gap, uphill for 2.5 miles. About half way up we appreciated switchbacks but they deceive us with heartbreaking  false summits. We are going up and up and we can see the sky and think we’ve reached the summit only to realize the trail makes a sharp turn and continues up. 


About a mile and a half up Tray mountain we found a nice log on the side of the trail. We thought “let’s take a little break, catch our breath and have some water.” It was a great spot to sit because we did not have to remove our heavy backpacks. When our break was over I stood up to continue on and I looked back at dad and he was having a heck of a time trying to stand up, he was swinging his legs trying to get leverage but it wasn’t happening. Maybe it was because his pack weighs 50+ lbs and those boney legs weren’t enough of a counter weight. I left him try for a few as we both were laughing but then I offered my hand and up the trail we went.


Today we met a hiker from Canada. We talked for a while and then he says “you don’t know how to tie your boots” it really sounded funny when he said it because we’ve been tying our shoes since we were 5 years old and thought we were quite proficient at it. He then untied one of his boots and demonstrated and explained why. That even tops Dad’s great idea of right hand back, left hand front. What Canada taught us really worked.


We met another hiker from Canada and 3 hikers from Germany, this AT thru hike was on their bucket list.  We also met a family, with 2 girls, from Oklahoma doing a thru hike.  So many friendly people.


We love you all and thanks for your prayers.","On top of Rocky Mountain

Cindy & Bill ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662386,"Last night we climbed in our tent around 2000 hrs, that I had set up all by myself.  Which we learned our heads were lower than our feet. After tossing and turning for hours I decided to put my head where my feet were. I was careful not to wake dad in our 2 person tent. Gradually I drifted off to sleep.  When we awoke this morning dad asked me if I was practicing my gymnastics in the middle of the night, I guess I woke him.  Lesson learned, pay attention to pitch of ground.


Today started good, we packed up and were on trail by 0815. We were making good time (although the German hikers passed us with ease) the weather was nice and we were enjoying our hike until a little twist and my knee started to hurt and became more painful on the steep downhill. Took 2 aspirin and feeling better.


I think my new trail name should be “cat hole expert” I either ate or drank something that didn’t agree with me. So far tonight I have dug 4 cat holes with more to come (my stomach is still gurgling). 


Our hiking days will continue to be shorter this week to plan on getting into town for Mass on Sunday.  We must plan for road crossings where a shuttle can pick us up.


We love you all, and thanks for your prayers (we really really need them)","Tray Mountain Shelter

Cindy & Bill ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662411,"Today, As we hike up trail, 2 section hikers pass us as we take our breakfast break. We chitchatted a bit, asked their names and they were on their way when one turns around and says “we didn’t get your names” so dad says “giggles and SW” the 2 hikers exclaimed “we heard of you SW and your story” and of course they were laughing. So dad is already known in this hiking community, how bout that!!!


So to get back to me and my hiking with a painful knee, today I was trying different hiking techniques. I tried short steps; keeping knees bent a little; the rest step; and the long stretch. And I found what worked, it was a combination of knees bent and right leg long stretch. Dad is following me and I guess paying attention to what I am doing and I finally say “I got it” and he said “ I’ve noticed your new stride, you remind me of Rocking Horse Charlie hiking along.” Thank you RHC because your style of walking eased my painful knee.


We must mention at every shelter on trail is a privy. A privy is a raised platform, 3 sided walls and a privacy section (no door) and a white plastic bucket with a toilet seat. When you use a privy and lift the lid a thousand flies come out at you, and you must be good a holding your breath. Once you sit down it’s just like home. It’s hard to believe the stench, the flies, and the dirty toilet seat that we would much rather use a privy than dig a cat hole!!

Cindy & Bill ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662486,"last night “who’s sock is this?” dad or mom closes eyes then smells and try’s to guess who smelly sock. First to throw up loses.
After 2 weeks without showering, boy does mom stink. She better take 2 showers, one right after the other. We arrive on schedule to find “Running Bear” (he is a previous hiker who wore his red Georgia Bulldog shirt with pride)  with trail magic and all the hikers that trekked past us today enjoying some goodies.  


At 1400 we hopped on the shuttle for the 10 mile ride down the mountain into Hiawassee, checked into the Budget Inn for 2 nights. Hopefully my knee will feel much better.One of the best experiences is the people we meet, almost all have started this hike by themselves. Sometimes we will hike days and then see someone we have met days earlier and it’s like a reunion of old friends…excitement and hugs!



It’s a simple life out here, we carry everything on our back. When it crosses our mind that we might need something, it shows up.

Cindy & Bill ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662530,"We came up with a great idea, to shower with our clothes on, it saves time and money. It worked well, our clothes are clean & smell good and so do we. It looks and feels odd though, instead of undressing I put all my clothes…ON and hopped in the shower.


Mom & pop restaurant right next door to our motel. Had the most delish breakfast, coffee, eggs homefries and the best homemade sausage we ever ate. Decided to go back for supper and walking up to restaurant realized no cars in parking lot, they closed at 1030 hrs. That’s ok a Dairy Queen 2 doors down.


We toured downtown Hiawassee. Dad walked and I hobbled 3/4 of a mile to Ingles grocery store to resupply and as we are leaving the store we wonder what we were thinking because we had 8 bags of groceries (one bag held a six pack of smartwater) and no car to transport and 1 bum knee.  We stood for a moment in the parking lot among all the cars and laughed, we’re walking? We made it back to the Motel and rested for the afternoon.


Called for a shuttle ride to Mass. Jason picked us up outside our room at the Budget Inn Motel and he comments “ I see you got the honeymoon suite.”

We left the hotel today looking forward to getting back on the trail and crawling in our tent at the end of the day. 
We were dropped off by our shuttle driver at Dicks Creek Gap to a surprise of TRAIL MAGIC. Even though we ate breakfast and lunch by 1030 at the motel, dad couldn’t resist a hot dog, snacks and pocket food. And I ate a banana so dad wouldn’t holler at me.


Minutes into our hike a hiker joined us. We offered the usual  “we will step aside so you can pass” but being of our age he was thrilled with our pace and hiked with us.
We arrived at our planned shelter destination at 1545, the 3 of us were the first here. As we were setting up our tents 2 hikers came to greet us also of similar age. We chitchatted for awhile and found out we are all retired and in age from 67 - 70. Dad’s considering changing the name of the shelter from Plumorchard Shelter to Rest Haven Shelter.


Tomorrow should be interesting the 5 of us have the same hopeful destination. Could it be “it’s a race” Rocking Horse Giggles and Old Muleee SW versus the “over the hill” gang. Stay tuned!


As we call it a night, 8 or more tents popped up, other hikers are staying in the shelter and there’s a campfire. But the “senior citizens” have all retired for the evening.

Cindy & Bill ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662720,"The winner has been announced!!! Coming in first place led by “Rocking Horse Giggles,” we beat out the “over the hill” gang by 1 hour!!


Our hike today was 7.4 miles and we crossed over into North Carolina. We were hoping NC would be a little kinder to us but it wasn’t happening, the mountains are just as grueling.



There were 2 blow downs on the trail that we had to go under. Dad thought he was low enough to clear the tree and his backpack was stopped by the tree and down he went. So the second blow down he concentrated on being low enough but unfortunately “down went Frazier” and he was down, face planted in the dirt, with a 50 lb pack on his back. I have to say it was comical watching him struggle trying to get up but he succeed and up the trail we went.
When we got to Muskrat shelter around 1500 hrs we set up our tent and backtracked a short distance to the creek to filter our water. And who comes marching down the trail but the “over the hill” gang. We were all excited to see each other, like long time friends. 


A little later we joined them in the shelter for supper and  camaraderie and jocularity.


Ending here! A hiker just said”I’m trying to sleep” Good night! (It’s 1957 hrs)

Cindy & Bill ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/662736,"We packed up and started on our way up the trail thinking we had at least 4 days yet of hiking to get to a crossroad and be picked up by a shuttle. As we stopped to have breakfast ( cold maple & brown sugar oatmeal) half way up the mountain a southbound day hiker stopped to chitchat with us. He told us in the Gap on the other side of the mountain is a forest service road and we can get a shuttle from there or if we wanted to wait till 1800 hrs  he would gladly give us a ride into Franklin.  It was a bitter/sweet feeling we were relieved that I could get off trail and heal but saddened that our awesome journey was coming to a close.


As we arrived at the forest service road we both took a turn in the thick brush to dig our last cat hole.  We noticed campsites just in case we had to stay for the night. I was trying to figure out where we were so I could tell the shuttle driver when a couple, our age, came down the trail. They asked if we were waiting for a ride, dad said “we’re hoping for a ride to Franklin.” They said come with us we will give you a ride (they are our trail angels).


Our thought was to rent a car from Enterprise car rental in Franklin. Our trail angels took us to Enterprise and waited till we got a car only to find out they will not rent “one way.” Trail angels offered for us to spend the night in their home but we declined (they already did so much for us and wouldn’t accept any cash). They drove us to the only motel in town (not as nice as the Budget inn motel because we had a shared bathroom).
So I went to searching on the internet, car rentals, bus ride, flights it was exhausting nothing with-in an hour and absolutely no “one way” rentals. As dad walked and I hobbled back to our motel after a bite to eat, I was almost in tears and right smack in front of us was a parking lot of UHAUL RENTALS.  Dad says “let’s rent a UHAUL” 
So we are making our, just under, 700 mile road trip home in a rented UHAUL truck.
(Our dear family offered to come get us but it’s a 10 hour drive and we didn’t want them to have to make such a trip in the spare of the moment)


We hope you enjoyed reading our journal as much as we enjoyed writing it. It was a fun, grueling adventure. Sorry it had to end so soon.
