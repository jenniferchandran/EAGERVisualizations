We plan to begin our AT hike on Tuesday, March 7, a little less than 2 weeks away. As the time approaches the more anxious I get. This will be a very different experience for Kerry and me. We are used to the wilds of the West and are not sure how we are going to feel in the more populated lands in the East. Neither of us have spent any time there: the odd visit for work etc. In anticipation, we re-read Bill Bryson’s book, “A Walk in the Woods” and found it to still be a good and encouraging read. 
I’ve decided not to stress over re-supply boxes but rather to buy food as we travel along. For the last few years we have gone without a stove, most recently on our hike of the Arizona Trail last year and found we were fine. In fact, aside from giving up the weight of the stove and fuel, it also freed up options for camping…water not being a criterion, we could stop when we wanted or when we were tired. I know it may be colder and wetter on the AT, at least to start, but even Kerry, Mr. “where’s my dinner” was enthusiastic about losing the stove. Felix, the dog, doesn’t care.
I am worried about the winter cold, so we’re looking at taking some warmer layers to start. For example, I ordered some lightweight neoprene gloves in hopes of keeping our hands a little drier and warmer whilst packing up in the morning. We’ll see!",,View Entry,"Feb 23, Thu",0

Today we had snow in the hills of Oakland, California. We are at 1200 feet and once in a few years (10??), we get a dusting but it’s uncommon enough to make me think about it and wonder how cold we’re going to be in Georgia. The East Coast also is getting a cold blast but not quite as far south as we are going.  I’m hoping the weather patterns will revert to predictable by the time we arrive.",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Fri",0

Today, Kerry and I got serious about packing, we actually were serious yesterday, but I was sidetracked by a repair to the back pocket of my backpack. I had ordered new mesh to sew over the holey pocket but had forgotten to install it. So, packing stopped for the repair.
Today, we started packing again. Then I realised we would not be able to take our knives in carry on baggage (we don’t plan to check our bags, preferring to keep things simple). Anyway, then I had to figure out how to get the knives to Georgia. Long story short, I mailed them to Ron Brown who will shuttle us from the airport to Amicalola Falls Lodge on Monday for our start Tuesday morning.
Not terribly interesting, this, but very indicative of the calm panic I feel right now. There are too many details that I know we won’t cover in time and I’m just going to do what I can and walk out of here Friday morning and let the rest go because it will be out of my need to control at that point.",,View Entry,"Feb 27, Mon",0

I took Felix to the vet today for his annual physical and to update his shots before we go.  The one I care about is Lyme disease…I understand there are a lot of tiny ticks on the east coast, and it’s hard to see them. We have big ones in California and after they grab Felix, they head straight for Kerry so I’m happy Felix can get some protection….too bad the vaccine is only for dogs. On a positive  note, I was very happy when the vet told me, unsolicited, that Felix is a very healthy dog…a good way to start our walk. 
Today was my final weekly volunteer activity day until we return, I was so honored that the group presented me with a send off card. Totally unexpected but so kind…what a great group of people, I’m honored to work with them! 
If this sounds like a wrap up…it is. In two days we head East and what we have not completed will remain undone. We had dinner with our house sitter tonight to orient him….knowing we can’t prepare him for everything, and understanding that we just have to let go…it’s time to go.",,View Entry,"Mar 01, Wed",0
"Jo, Kerry & Felix",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660472,"What a day! I don’t know where to begin. From having a custom shuttle ride to Denver airport courtesy Comfort Inn (due to a mixup—theirs) to being no-end of hassled at the airport by TSA security (carryon luggage) and lectured by a dragon lady flight attendant on the plane (no particular reason!) we arrived in Atlanta Monday afternoon more than a little stressed. Ron Brown picked us up at the airport (very helpful and informative) and brought us and a young couple to Amicalola Falls State Park. We had a good relaxing dinner at the lodge where we plan to spend the night.
In the morning, we will register at the visitor center and start our climb to Springer Mountain, the official start of Appalachian Trail. I will be offline until we reach our next town.

We are blessed. Today, the sun shone in a blue sky and a cool breeze kept us comfortable all day. Perfect hiking weather and a hopeful beginning to our hike.
We didn’t sleep very well last night…on California time I was still awake at 1 a.m. finally falling into a restful sleep around 6 a.m. We dragged ourselves out of bed at 6:45 a.m., went for breakfast (they gave us the senior discount without us asking—we must look old!), and then walked the 1 1/4 miles to the visitor center to register. Now, officially hiker #866 and #867, we walked up the approach trail to the top of Amicalola Falls….all 604 stairs (4 times as high as Niagara Falls according to Ron Brown), returning to the lodge to pick up our packs. Then the fairly steep climb to Springer Mountain, where the trail officially starts.
The trees are still mostly bare, so we were treated to views of the dormant forest that will disappear into spring in a few weeks. The forest floor was soft with dead leaves from last fall with intermittent basalt rocks and other rocks sparkling with mica (?),  After Springer we walked into forests of towering rhododendrons; full of buds and ready to bloom. Someone is in for a treat in the coming weeks. We stopped at Stover Creek shelter, put up our tent (lots of people here, but no one in the shelter! ).
It’s been a lovely day….a one foot in front of the other kind of day. Hope I sleep better tonight!

"Jo, Kerry & Felix",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660610,"We were up at 6:30 a.m. after a reasonable night’s sleep in spite of late arrivals at the shelter, complete with bright flashlights and people hanging their packs on the cables right next to us! We vowed we would figure out a way to avoid repeating the experience, but more on that later.
More rhododendron forests under the evergreens until after Hawk Mountain where we returned to more naked deciduous trees, very happy about this as we still had great views of the rolling hill/mountains around us. We saw tiny purple violets…a first touch of spring a mid the dead leaves. 
We were passed by a lot of young people, which I expected, but we also passed a lot of not so young people, which I did not expect.
Coming up ahead is a section where hard bear canisters are required, so we have to hike about 15 miles to reach Neel Gap to avoid camping in that area. We decided to hike past the Gooch Shelter and on to Gooch Gap parking area to put us closer to Neel Gap for tomorrow’s hike. Here we are now, sitting by a fire after drinking a beer and eating a Chick-fil-A sandwich courtesy Matt, aka Moon Dog, who was sitting when we arrived looking like he was waiting for us. We are told a lot of trail magic happens in the south, and not to expect it as we move to  “the North”. We’ll see. Meanwhile, my faith in humanity just took a step to the positive….random acts of kindness and all that.

It rained lightly last night, just enough to require a bit of a fire drill to batten down the hatches to keep the rain outside. As it turned out the rain was too light to cause a real problem. 
For breakfast, Matt made us bacon, cheese and egg sandwiches…that may seem like a silly thing to note, but it was an unexpected treat for us….set us up for the day.
The terrain continued much the same with the browns of winter, but the grey skies turned our world a monochrome sepia locally, whilst looking into the distance, the misted rolling mountains looked blue…quite foreign to our Western eyes. Tiny purple violets and petite white daisy-like bloodroots brought some welcome color. At the end of the day we climbed Blood Mountain, the highest peak on the trail in Georgia. It was quite a climb going up but much steeper coming down!
We awoke to a mottled grey sky that darkened as the day wore on bringing more drops of rain in the afternoon, again not enough to make us uncomfortable. However, being rain weenies and with the threat of rain just about 100% for tomorrow, we decided to get off the trail at Neel Gap to stay dry and get cleaned up. 
We caught a shuttle to the Seasons Inn in Blairsville, which had been recommended by other hikers. It is 16 miles off trail, a $40 shuttle. The owners Colleen and Chris, clearly dedicated Christians as evidenced by ubiquitous signs and books, but not pushy about it, were very kind and helpful. Their hiker rate, good until the end of March, I think, is $60 a night.
We have made good mileage over the last three days, and now seems a good time for a brief rest and regroup before moving on! Felix, happy Felix, as much as he loves to run, is very happy to sleep!

"Jo, Kerry & Felix",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660628,"We slept until a little after 6 a.m. one might assume, wrongly, more comfortably than on the ground. I can’t explain that, but it’s true.
Today, we just sat around, catching up (?). Kerry was figuring out how to add photos to this journal, and the dog, well, he enjoyed an all day nap. In the evening, we went in search of dinner and a beer (for Kerry, beer gives me a headache). Eventually, we ended up at Lucky’s, a mostly Mexican affair that was very good. Kerry had his beer and I had a very good, real margarita. We walked into the restaurant with Felix (the dog) and tried to slink off into a corner but were waived over by another couple, who clearly wanted Felix to sit nearby. It happened that they lost their own dog recently. We struck up a conversation with them; retired, they moved here most recently from Atlanta. They, Louise and Tony, were entertaining and have taken up pickleball. I’m recording this here because I think it’s amazing that you can sit down with strangers and just enjoy the moment. To me, this is one of the gifts of the trail. 
When we returned to Seasons Inn, we ran into Debbie, another retiree hiking the trail who is worried about the coming rain the day after tomorrow. The dilemma is whether to hunker down and leave on Monday (after the rain) or just go for it tomorrow. But the weather is a moving target….I/we have to decide.

Henry, our shuttle driver, met us at the coffee shop at 7. We all ordered coffee and we had a muffin before we set off for Neal Gap. It was 32 degrees and we felt the cold. The wind was blowing ferociously so we picked up our pace and soon we weren’t so focused on it. We walked past many tents still closed up tight, probably against the cold. 
The scenery and walking continued much as it has for the last three days. climbing up and climbing down on duff and old rocks. We were enjoying ourselves. About five miles in, we came to Teenastee Gap where we met Lisa and David aka Granola and Donut, who were serving hot dogs, all kinds of goodies and soft drinks. They asked us if we would like a hot dog and we said “yes”….it was 10:30 a.m and we thoroughly enjoyed the food!
We walked up and down another mountain and came to Hogpen Gap, where we met Barry, Michelle, Bobby and Mitzi, who had prepared a veritable feast. Kerry had homemade vegetable beef soup (Bobby said his soup is the best in the world and it was!). Barry offered and we accepted a prayer for our safety (who can’t use a prayer?)
Thus fortified we had lots of energy and walked all the way to Blue Mountain Shelter. Tonight, we are sleeping inside the shelter, we tried to go to Enota Mountain Resort, to get out of the coming rain, but learned it was closed. So we decided to take the last two remaining places in the shelter to stay dry. I’m hoping Felix will keep the mice away. Frostbite told us one ran across his face last night. Kerry has been enjoying the company of other hikers, talking up a storm.
Today, as we were talking, I thought about my cousin, Suzanne, an only child like me. She died 10 years ago today.

We slept in the shelter last night and tonight we plan to do the same. Last night poured cats and dogs and we were mercifully well protected under the shelter.  No mice either! We don’t know if Felix scared them off or if it was just too wet and miserable for them. Felix doesn’t seem too interested in mice, but he loves squirrels! 
The clocks went forward today and we slept-in until 8:30 a.m. it was slow going today. We got 2 miles down the trail and Kerry discovered that he didn’t have his phone. So he left Felix and me in the middle of the trail for 1-1/2 hours while he went back to the shelter to see if he had left it. It turns out he didn’t--he had unwittingly stuffed it in the bottom of his pack as he would find out later! By the time he got back to us, Felix and I were very cold. We walked a half mile to Unicoi Gap where we met trail angel, Dale (who also let me sit in his car to warm up),who had pastries for us and nearby, another trail angel, Mike, who brought McDonald’s chicken biscuits. Again the kindness of strangers!
The mist/cloud that we woke up in never went away. It was cold and white all day. Tomorrow is supposed to be better, but colder.
When we arrived at the shelter, there was room for us, so we decided to stay in it. It’s still damp and cold and we were feeling a little discouraged about the phone and the weather. Well, tomorrow’s another day….
Happily, when all hope was lost, Kerry found his phone wrapped in his sleeping bag! Thank heavens…he was beside himself! BTW this explains why we only have one photo today.

We awoke to misted skies again, and ice cold wind. Kerry said it was 29 degrees this morning after we started walking and it had probably risen by then. It was only 39 degrees by afternoon and the forecast predicts it will get colder over the next few days. Based on this we decided to go in to the Around the Bend Hostel at Dick’s Gap for the night.
The terrain continued much the same today but we were treated to the sight of ice-rimed trees that look like they were covered in the white blossoms of spring. As we climbed the ridges between Addis and Dick’s Gap we got icicled on: icicles rained down us. We had never seen such a thing. I imagined someone sitting in the sky throwing icicles at us like the trees throwing apples at Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz. It turned out that the wind was blowing the melting ice out of the trees. It was quite magical.
We met Boy Scout Troop 115 out of Tallahassee, FL up here for spring break working on their camping merit badge. Why so far from home? Apparently, 1000 foot ascents are impossible to find in Florida….one of the badge requirements.
At Dick’s Gap, what else? More trail magic, a cheeseburger and drink each, just to tide us over until dinner time. The angels came from the hostel so they gave us a ride up the hill. Full amenities: shower, laundry, bed to sleep in and FOOD.
At the hostel, we showered, cleaned our clothes and ate. We’re sharing a bedroom with 2 others, Crossroads  who left the air force after 9 years, and DaVinci, who had two tattoos after Leonardo Da Vinci's famous drawings of a man with outstreched arms in a circle and square and another one I can't remember, who seems to be an AT veteran.  Looking forward to a warm night before we sally forth into the cold end of Georgia Winter!","Tray Mountain Shelter

It is almost 8 p.m. Kerry says the temperature is 29 degrees. He wanted to sleep in the shelter again because he thought it would be less cold on our hands trying to put the tent away in the morning, I’m not sure that is so. We are alone tonight. I’m tucked inside my sleeping bag trying to write this with shaking hands…by the  light of the dying day. Even Felix is shaking from the cold.
It was a beautiful day, The endless gray dormant trees our constant scenery, stood naked against a deep blue sky. It made the walk joyous and kept our spirits up against the cold. It never got above the low 40s and the wind kept us a good deal colder than that.
About eight miles in, we crossed the State line leaving Georgia and entering North Carolina. I did not expect to leave Georgia so soon and felt more than a little wistful about it. I can’t convey how genuinely kind people people have been; they seem to reflect the gentle miles that we have walked. The rolling mountains have been tough, but the duff of last year’s leaves beneath our feet have been more than kind, especially to Felix’s paws. We will miss it…
“Georgia, GeorgiaThe whole day throughThis old sweet songKeeps Georgia on my mind”
Today we saw lots of icy streams that never melted, lots of ice grown into crystal shapes we have never seen before….flowers, shards and feathers. Also, more dead wood that I forgot to mention before, that appears to be painted with a bright aqua green color; perhaps a mold?
It was so cold we all drank very little: not only was drinking ice cold water unappealing, but the consequent need to pee was downright terrifying to me. Of greater concern to ladies I think, the thought of dropping one’s drawers even for a second let alone the minutes the process takes was just too much to contemplate. It was positively torture.
In sum, we were cold in the hostel last night. So we started the day cold and we never warmed up. Still shaking, I’m bundled in all my clothes in hopes of sleep tonight.

Standing Indian Shelter to Long Branch Shelter 102.1-85.9= 17.2 Ending elevation 4431 feet
We  woke up to an ice cold morning at 29 degrees, it was all we could do to pack up and get moving.Too cold to eat, we would do that in a couple hours when we found some sun and left the wind.
Since entering North Carolina, I notice that we are going up, hiking along at more than 4,000 feet and frequently over 5,000 feet. Also, the ascents are amazingly steep. On the approach to Mt Albert (5,189 ft) we climbed forever, even at one point up a log ladder. It was grueling, but at the top we were rewarded with some of the best views we’ve seen: the mountains blue across the Coweeta basin. 
Lots more rhododendron forests…now with droopy leaves; Kerry says the ice does that and that the ice/freeze and that they will recover. I figured out that we are also seeing wild azaleas (shorter bushes and smaller leaves).
In Georgia, the path was relatively clear, but here we are navigating blow downs frequently: many are recent but I think some have been here for awhile.
We saw the most wonderful icicles hanging from rocks and amazing ice formations almost since the first day, Ice that looks like shards of glass, like flowers and some like hair growing out of the ground. Kerry has some photos of them.
We were walking most of the day in black mud, deceptively slippery…we had a couple of close calls in the spill department. 
Night has come and we elected to stay in the shelter again tonight. It’s warmer, so I’m hoping to sleep better.

Ending elevation at Wayah Gap 4,143 feet
What a day! First of all, Kerry and I agree that Long Branch was the best shelter we have stayed in, so far. Fairly new, it boasted two floors. The roof was only high enough to sit in and in spite of bumping our heads several times, we found the smaller space marginally warmer (that might have been psychological, because it was, in fact, warmer last night). The one complaint I have is that we had snorers on both side of us and, add insult to injury, one of them, having had a great night’s sleep, started banging around at the crack of dawn and woke us up from our only restful sleep all night. Oh well!
We had hoped to cover the next thirty two or so miles to NOC in the next two days but we have been watching the weather all week and the forecast is for rain tomorrow, followed by heavier rain toward nightfall. Having the option of going into Franklin and avoid the rain and cold was too tempting to pass up. We walked the 3.7 miles to Rock Gap, breakfastless against the cold again, to be greeted by the Captain who offered us hot dogs and hot coffee, which were gratefully accepted. One might think we would be tired of hot dogs or at least not interested in them for breakfast and one would be wrong. We were hungry and it was cold….the food and hot coffee, and a cookie thrown in, we’re perfect.
As we were sitting there, Zen, from Gooder’s Grove Hostel showed up. He was driving hikers up to Wayah Gap, 9.5 miles ahead to slack pack back. He offered for us to join the group and since we will lose tomorrow to the rain, we accepted….and that’s how we were able to walk the extra miles today, not quite as far as we planned but close enough!
It was another stunningly blue day walking up and down mountains covered in the grey dormant trees whose branches, like the arms of wraiths, appeared to stretch up to touch the sky. As the day wore on, we started to smell smoke….apparently a prescribed burn near Helen.
As I write this, I’m sitting in a real bed, freshly showered (again) awaiting my clean clothes to finish in the laundry. We feel totally spoiled….this is not the West Coast backpacking we are used to!
Felix, having had a great doggy day (like us a long walk without his pack) and now, a full tummy, is blissfully asleep on the floor beside us.

Kerry and I shared a king bed at Gooder Grove Hostel last night but I did not sleep well. I tossed and turned and counted several hundred sheep but my sleep was restless.
And today was a shockingly sad day. We got up and had a luxurious cup of coffee in the kitchen when Tennessee Slim, Zen’s helper, came in in tears. Zen, the kindly, middle-aged man who owned the hostel died last night. He picked us up at the trailhead yesterday and we drove with him down a long dirt road to Deep Gap to drop off another hiker, Campbell, before driving into town where we bought dinner for all of us at Bojangles on Zen’s recommendation. In the few hours we knew him he told us his Dad, who died in 2012, had owned the Macon County News (newspaper) where he had worked with him with a particular interest in investigative reporting. These days, not in touch with his mother, brother and sister (he seemed a little wistful about this), it was obvious that he put heart and soul into the hostel and shuttling/taking care of his hikers. He was intense, taking calls, sorting out logistics and staying on top of a hundred details every minute we were with him.
When you walked into the hostel, there was a sign that read, “3 Rules: 1) Be kind, 2) Be kind to clean and 3) Be helpful to others.”
Today a constant gray rain fell, and even though it was expected, it felt like the sky was mourning Zen. The police and EMS workers came and the work of shutting down the business, diverting hikers and canceling shuttle and other obligations began with help from some of the hikers who had been there for awhile.
We had a reservation at the Saphire Motel in Franklin because Zen had already told us he only had room for us for one night…so there we went. Jen came too. I had been thinking that the trail was an allegory for life, one foot in front of another, one day at a time, but perhaps it is also an allegory for death….you can’t know with any certainty when the journey will end.
We met Shera (pronounced, She-ra) again…he told us that He was walking on the Florida Trail and 600+ miles in, someone threatened to string him up and hang him. This combined with other frightening incidences convinced him to come North and switch to the Appalachian Trail, which is how we met him.
On a happier note we met Turtle (again, I think) and his 15 year-old dog, Pup. He showed us how to make a rain poncho for Felix and gave us some other sage tips for hiking the AT with a dog.
In the evening we went to a Mexican restaurant with Jen and then on to the “Lazy Hiker” for more conversation, some good local music and a beer…a nice ending to a rather sad day.

Today, we intended to hike to Weser Bald Shelter about 16 miles away, but decided to push on to Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) because temperatures over the next few days  are projected to go as low as 10 degrees and given the opportunity to sleep inside we thought it was worth going the extra miles to make it happen. We’re not sure what we will do tomorrow…I’m going to sleep on it!
The results of yesterday’s rainstorm were on full display in the trees high on the mountains. Climbing up to Wayah Bald the trees had held on to the rain and turned it into little hairs which flew off them like snow when wind blew. The white forest gave the appearance of looking at trees covered in spring blossoms. One mountainside looked like it was covered in enormous balls of white crystals, while other more distant ridges had silver ridges. A magical winter wonderland, three days from the spring equinox!
It was cold….Kerry saw the temperature drop o 22 degrees on the North side of Wayah Bald near the top. The temperatures rose by 10 degrees when we periodically went lower and walked on the leeward sides without the wind.
We stayed high most of the day and walked ridges with amazing views on both sides. When we weren’t enjoying the views, we were negotiating the numerous blow downs which were especially wicked coming down from Weser Bald to the NOC. 
More trail magic, sadly, the Burningtown Baptist Church turned out in force to share hot dogs and other food at Burningtown Gap, but at 1:15 we were the only hikers they had seen all day. They were disappointedly packing up, the hot food already gone but they kindly shared bananas and cake with us. We were suitably grateful!
One funny thing…about half way through the day, Kerry looked down at his pants and declared I was wearing his pants! It was true, somehow we’d swopped in the darkness of the morning and not realized it! I thought my pants were big and couldn’t figure out how I was losing all that weight!
Helene, the owner of Gorge Us Stays picked us up about 8 PM (yes, we had some night hiking!) and brought us here. We showered, washed our clothes (again, what a luxury—one might think we’re out for a stroll), shared a frozen pizza and some chili. Then blessedly, SLEEP!

We slept better last night…the sleep of the very tired…and warm. Helene drove us back to the NOC and I bought a sandwich for lunch and some snacks. I also bought an OR hat to keep the sun off my face. Today I wore a beanie, a fleece hat with the sun hat on top. I think I must have looked ridiculous, but I needed all three. 
We finally left the NOC at 10 a.m. this morning. It was bitterly cold today, the high 36 and the low 18 degrees. Kerry and I commiserated that the bones in our faces hurt from the cold.
That said, the sun shone golden on us and kept our spirits up. There was still plenty of ice on the ground but the magic in the trees was gone; blown away on the wind. In addition to the usual mountains we climbed up and down, there were plenty of icy wind blown ridge lines to walk along.
We had hoped to spend the night at Brown Fork shelter two miles farther on, but due to our late start, it would have been nightfall before we got there. We saw Jen in the mid afternoon and we all decided that it might be better to stop at Stecoah Gap and go to a hostel. She found Craig, at Cabin in the Woods, and he had space for us all in one room. We gladly made the reservation.
When we got to Stecoah Gap, a team of people were just wrapping up an all day trail magic event, and they offered us drinks and chips, which, as usual, we accepted gratefully. Craig took us back to his house and fed us pizza and beer. We met Fitzi, another hiker staying there while waiting out a leg injury.
It was a good day. Tomorrow it is supposed to start warming up…I hope so because the day after tomorrow we head into the Smokies.

The first day of spring and this morning, for the first time in days, the temperatures climbed from 26 degrees at 9 a.m to the 50s by afternoon. The sky was blue and the sun was shining…this always makes me happy!
East of the San Francisco Bay, where we live, stands 3,849 foot Mt. Diablo. On that mountain is a very steep trail called Burma Road. It is so steep that going down it is a bit scary…once you get going it’s hard to stop. Our friend, Scott Williams claims going up this trail is the best preparation for the AT. Today, we went up the equivalent of Burma Road at least 10 times…and down it too! It was that kind of day.
The woods are quiet…you can see forever through the tall trees, and it all looks gray and brown against the endless dead leaves on the ground. It’s almost as though the animals have left for warmer, greener climes. I don’t think they’re hiding, because Felix would know…he’s very curious. Every once in a while he puts his ears back or sniffs the air, but it’s usually another hiker. I think the animals will return when the trees leaf out and there’s more food and places to hide. We haven’t even seen a squirrel!
There aren’t a lot of birds either, we hear the occasional bird: woodpeckers and owls, but not a lot of bird chirping. Reminds me of Keats: “The sedge is withered from the lake, And no birds sing.”
We did see a single Robin yesterday at the NOC.
We thought about going on to the Fontana Dam Shelter tonight, but as we pulled up to Fontana Road, the last bus of the evening was leaving for Fontana Lodge and the thought of a good meal before our foray into the Smokies was too much providence to turn down, so we didn’t. We had a great meal and a shower and tomorrow we head into the Smokies, so we will be offline for a few days.
At the lodge we met up with some other hikers we have met along the way. We’re enjoying meeting different people from different states that we would never know, but for the trail. 
I am so grateful we got to sleep warm the last few very cold nights. I worry most about Felix who Is not used to temperatures below freezing, but things are looking up…

We picked up some odds and ends (food) at the Fontana Marina to see us through the Smokies, and then headed across Fontana Dam and started up into the mountains on the other side. A repeat of yesterday in reverse! It was 10 a.m. before we got going but we made pretty good progress and arrived at the shelter some time after 5. The Park Service makes it clear they want hikers to stay in the shelters and we plan to comply!
I was very proud of myself…the permit I applied for required an estimated entry date to traverse the park and I had given March 21 as a wild-assed guess…and here we are entering the park on the very date!
We met a lot of new people today, I sense this is part of the experience on the AT, people pass each other for a while and the people you see change over days and weeks. Another allegory for life, perhaps? People become very close for a short time, sometimes they remain in one’s life, but more often than not they’re gone and we’re off to new experiences. Later, Snail, a slow hiker, was lamenting this very experience.
The sun shone today but tomorrow it will rain, at least it got up into the 60s today. This is our first night back outside in the last five….it should be warmer although at this elevation who knows?
One more thing…our first deer today, thankfully, Felix didn’t see them.
I’m thinking about the Hendricks martini I had last night…it had 5 olives, which I shared with Kerry (3), Jenn (1) and one for me…I’m really just a one olive woman! The memory will have to keep me going until the next one!

The rain started last night, pattering on the translucent roof from the early hours of the morning. It was forecast to begin clearing by 11 a.m. instead it lasted all day. In fact, it became more intense as the day wore on. Eventually, it stopped late in the evening.
We walked along in fog…a cloud filled with rain all day and on the high ridges icy wind made sure we stayed cold and miserable. Even the little poncho we made for Felix fell apart after 8 miles so he was a wet doggy. We learned that we are not fully equipped for the rain. On other trails, we found rain pants to be a hindrance, but in this part of the country, I think we need them. 
When we got to this shelter, where apparently people have stayed holed up all day, there was no room for us and we were too wet and cold to go on. Instead, we cowboy-camped on the dirt floor, just to be dry. We got some grumbles from an old guy who thought we blocked his exit to a midnight pee (in fairness, we did create an obstruction to be navigated but we were desperate!). We also received some random acts of kindness: ""Good Vibe,"" from the north of Germany, offered up his place in the shelter to one of us and loaned us a trash bag and pad to help us out when we said we’d stay together. And ""Road Soda"" loaned us a space blanket to keep Felix warm. In the end, we had a warmer night than the night before!
I was so sorry for the views we missed in the whiteout today. Hopefully, we’ll get some views tomorrow.
Yesterday, I was thinking of martinis, tonight I would be in heaven with hot chocolate!
Last night, ""Drive Thru,"" a 34 year Army veteran with PTSD, was in the shelter and he would cry out in his sleep occasionally. He told us this morning that Felix came over to nuzzle him in the night. I apologized but he said it was very sweet. Felix taking care of people. Unfortunately, today, this same couple arrived after us and decided to walk on in the rain and darkness to the next shelter almost 4 miles farther on. They said they arrived there after 10 p.m. to the last two available shelter spaces. I don’t think I physically could have continued.
That’s all…I’m tired and warming my feet in front of the fire, drying my clothes, listening to the rain and trying to steel myself to find the courage to go out and relieve myself before I sleep!

We were much warmer last night, I think because on the ground we all cuddled up, and even though I didn’t feel it the fire was near by. We got going at 8:30 AM which is early for us so far. We had some hard climbs ahead, ultimately up Clingman’s Dome at 6,612 feet, I think the highest point in the Smokies. A week ago there was snow up there. Today, there was plenty of ice, but the snow was gone and temperatures were in the 50s.
We’ve been in Tennessee the last two days and I didn’t know it. I asked Jessica and Anderson from Tennessee how you know you’re in Tennessee and they told me the shelters in North Carolina have privies, while those in Tennessee do not. Tonight we have a nice clean privy (the best so far!), so we must be back in North Carolina.
We stopped at Silas Bald Shelter for lunch today and Felix was beside himself when three white-tailed deer walked through. They look about the same size as our deer at home, maybe a little bigger, but these have long white brushy tails, very striking. It’s a good thing he was on a four foot leash; had he got away, I have no doubt we would not have seen him again for a very long time. All that training…you can take the dog out of the wild but I don’t think you can take the wild out of the dog. It doesn’t take much to get that lizard brain activated.
We met our second ridge runner today, a fellow by the name of Chris, who was very nice and informative. He was not happy to hear about the overfill at the shelter last night.
We both felt a little lacking in energy today, it could have been the cold yesterday, but I’m thinking we’re beginning to feel the calorie deficit. It’s supposed to rain again tomorrow night and the next day, so Kerry wants to go into Gatlinburg to avoid the weather but he’s also curious about the town, which has been described to us as “Disneyland”.

Short hiking day today. We are now more than 200 miles in. Good Vibe decided to walk with us in hopes we would split the cost of a shuttle in to Gatlinburg. We told him we would be happy to meet him at New Found Gap, knowing that he walks much faster than we do but he insisted on walking with us, ostensibly to practice his English, which is fluent.
We had an enjoyable three miles, if slipping in mud or sliding on ice is your thing, or even if it isn’t because there was no way to avoid either one, Then we reached Indian Grave Gap, where unexpectedly, we came to a road. There were two men, section hikers and a man and his wife out for a day hike, taking a break. We got to talking with the man and his wife, or should I say woman and her husband? Anyway, their names were Heidi and Dave, he in IT and she a former USO performer, current teacher, here on Spring break with their 14 year-old son from Madison, WI. After a brief conversation, they offered to take us to Gatlinburg since they were going there. We followed them the 1.7 miles to New Found Gap,  bundled into their car and here we are in Gatlinburg.
The “burg” definitely lives up to its reputation: lots of glitz and kitsch complete with a space needle and Ridley’s Believe it or Not. But we were happy: shower, clean clothes and the biggest hamburgers (medium rare) I have ever seen.
Later, Jenn showed up…I don’t know how she puts the miles away, we will be in her history soon at the pace she is going! 
Everyone is fed, sleepy and warm and the potential rain is outside for the night!

I did not sleep well last night….it was about 2 a.m. before I dropped off only to be surprised awake by the loudest thunder, I think, that I have ever heard. The wind howled and the rain came down and out of the rain spout outside our motel room as though from a fire hose. Kerry was worried about tornadoes….it was intense. This morning the sun is shining and we headed to the NOC to see if we could find better rain gear options, which we did…we both got light weight rain pants and jackets, then later I had to replace the lightweight Polartec shirt I’ve had for 20 years because the zipper broke. This is turning into a more expensive effort than I thought. That said, it’s good to have options!
We ran into ""Good Vibe"" who was waiting for the road to open to the park so he could return to the trail. He gave me the name and phone number of the fellow, ""Tobasco Hiker,"" who was taking him (and who subsequently agreed to take Kerry, Jenn, Felix and I back at 7:30 AM back to New Found Gap tomorrow morning). Tobasco Hiker told me the road opened mid-afternoon and Good Vibe is back on trail.
Most of the day we spent relaxing and eating too much, sort of like bears who gorge to keep them going through the winter sleep. In our case, it’s in anticipation of the food shortage to come before we find another town and a good meal. It’s always a balancing act. We don’t want to carry too much because it’s heavy, but if we don’t carry enough we get hungry. I’m not complaining, it seems to work out in the end.
Everyone loves Felix, wherever we go, people stop and want to pet him. I think he’s seen more people in Gatlinburg in the last day and a half than he has in his entire life. It’ll be good to get back to the peace of the trail.

Tobasco picked us up (Kerry, Felix, Jenn and I) at 7:30 this morning. He, Tobasco, started a thru hike in 2020 (I think) and had to stop due to a knee injury. He is still sorting through that but in the meantime, he drove 4 hours from Kentucky this weekend, just to help out hikers; creating his own hiking karma.Tobasco impressed us with his opinion that any Mexican restaurant encountered on any trail “is incredible.”
It was raining and gloomy and I was worried that we were walking into another deluge but Jenn assured me it would be short-lived. Apparently, the storms that have decimated parts south of us are moving west to east, not northward. In fact, once we were on the trail the weather improved and by afternoon we had sunshine and mostly blue skies.
The walk today was beautiful, we gained almost 1000 feet in elevation but the guide says total ascent 3550 feet, descent 4455 feet; not sure about the math, but we definitely did the ascending and descending! It felt like a long staircase always going up and when we reached the ridge line we walked along it, up and down all day. The forest now is mostly evergreen and the forest floor is full of deep green mossy logs and low grassy undergrowth. Jenn walked with us until about 1 and after lunch she walked on ahead….she is faster than us so that made sense. We all ended up at the shelter, us quite a bit later, at 5:30 p.m.
We decided to stay in the shelter as it might rain again tonight. There are a lot of people here. As I write this I’m listening to several conversations at once….mostly 20 to 40  year olds who talked about a lot of things, a lot about endings and beginnings and strangely, to me, about redemption. I’m here just to walk, so I’m not sure what to make of it, something to think about. This is more of a social scene than I have experienced since I retired…a bit disconcerting! Perhaps this will change when we leave the Smokies...we’ll see.

Another long day….first in the fog and the conifers, a long upward climb, then more ridge line walking with potential views on both sides…I say potential because the fog came and went with the clouds we walked through. The first half of the day stormy clouds threatened rain but Jenn assured us they would blow over and they did. We walked in sunshine down from the mountains and I’m sure we won’t be cold tonight. Fairly certain it won’t rain either, but we’ll see!
We passed an old plane crash site just past Mt. Guyot, and saw some wreckage. I’ll have to look that up. As we descended out of the evergreen trees, we started seeing the bare limbed deciduous trees and the ever present rhododendron forest once again. I found walking down from the mountain perhaps harder than walking up…pounding on the old joints is no fun.
At Davenport Gap where we left the Smokies, there were 3 trail angels, Ma Maw B, and Mad Hat and his wife Ewok, visiting from Minnesota. We each had a soda and Kerry had a really good homemade rice crispy treat, whilst I had a little snickers bar (craving chocolate, I am). This gave us much needed energy to walk the remaining 2 miles to Standing Bear Hostel.

We each had a hot cup of coffee before we left, a nice treat to get us going.
Skies started out with puffs of iron grey clouds that looked ominous and gradually morphed into a uniform grey ceiling that spat rain at us occasionally until it decided to settle into a steady soaking mist in the late afternoon. We decided to call it a day at this shelter, because we were wet and cold and having climbed straight up at least three substantial mountains, we were also tired.
The scenery doesn’t change, sill more of the dormant trees and rhododendron forests, against distant blue mountains. We summited one mountain with a windowless building atop and signs ominously warning that it was an FAA facility….but the views were wonderful on all sides. That was before the sun gave into the clouds. On the way down to the shelter, the valleys between the mountains were filled with rivers of white fluffy clouds.

We awoke to deep blue skies and the usual accompanying freezing temperatures. It took a while to warm up but we we were only ever warm on those long slogs straight up the mountains.
In the shelter again last night, Kerry and I are now firmly agreed, that except for rain (certified rain weenies that we are), we will be sleeping in our tent far from the madding crowd, so to speak. This includes the snorers (they can’t help it) and the blow-up thermarest devotees who squeak and crunch all night long on their bed pads, keeping the rest of us awake listening to them. 
The weather being beautiful, kept our spirits high all day and we made good time. We notice the forest floor is turning green in places…upon a close look, there are little green leaves peeking through the brown leaves,,,a hopeful sign?
When we got to Hot Springs ,we happened in to the Laughing Heart Hostel. Someone cancelled a private room at the last minute, so we got it….after last night, Kerry did not want to sleep with the community, he wanted to enjoy his own snoring, unmolested.

Little violets, bloodroots, dandelions, phlox and a host of others we don’t have names for.
Even though we got up early, it took us time to get organized and leave the hostel. We went to the Smoky Mountain Diner for a hearty breakfast (we sat with Curious George again), then walked down the street to the Post Office, where the postmistress, Angel (!!!) helped us mail home more stuff we didn’t need, including Kerry’s blood pressure medicine…as usual, in spite of his best efforts, he finds it works against him, making him feel faint while doing this kind of exercise, so he gave it up for now.
It was 10:30 a.m. before we got going and we expected to go to the first shelter 11 miles away, but when we got there the sun was still shining encouragingly and rain is in the forecast for some time tomorrow so we thought we should take advantage of the great hiking conditions, which is why we are camping by ourselves here at Allen Gap.
Today we passed a group of kids with their teacher, Steve from JC Williams Montessori School, a secondary public school in Raleigh, NC. I didn’t know Montessori had high schools, apparently, it’s fairly new.
Yesterday, we passed 2 grave markers for Eva and George Cragg, 1882-1940 and 1881-1966, respectively. Then today, we passed another grave marker for Rex R. Pulford, 1920-1983. I wonder who they were and how they got there…probably, wouldn’t be allowed now?
At Mill Ridge Road, trail angels Monarch and Ron served us cheeseburgers, with all the fixings, carrots, fruit, chips and sodas. This accounts for our walking 15 miles and enjoying every minute of it. What’s that saying? An army marches on its stomach?…I can see there is truth in that. Monarch and Ron drove 4 plus hours from Little Rock, Arkansas to feed complete strangers walking down the trail! 
The silence tonight is lovely…Kerry hung the food bag ingeniously from a high thick vine, and we hope the bears are still sleeping, although after today I think they’ll be waking soon! Felix will undoubtedly let us know if anyone comes. Darkness has come and hiker midnight is upon us.

We were forewarned the weather would change, but after perfect blue skies yesterday, it was still disappointing to awaken to cold grey skies threatening rain. It saps my spirits.

The forecast is for rain tonight and over the next few days so it may be slow going to Erwin.
It’s Kerry’s 70th birthday today…and I thought about the steak and lobster dinner we should be eating to celebrate it, accompanied by one of Kerry’s excellent wines. Instead, we were on a high windy ridge clambering over rocks like a couple of old goats. We’ll make up for it later I hope!
We stopped at 3 p.m., staying in the shelter to avoid tonight’s rain; we’d rather start dry even if it isn’t possible to stay so.
Felix, apparently, didn’t get enough exercise today. After 12 miles, he caught the scent of something that made him wild….had he not been leashed, I am sure he would have rounded it up! Oh well, tomorrow is another day.

The wind blew hard all night. About 4 a.m thunder and lightning joined the cacophony and then the rain came crashing down….this kept up until about 7:30 a.m. we usually wake up about 6:15, but this morning there was no point, so we slept in. The rain lightened up and by 9 a.m. when we finally started walking, the rain had stopped, the skies started clearing and by afternoon, it was blue skies and sunshine once more. Why couldn’t we have this for Kerry’s birthday?
The wind started picking up in the morning too; it started with leaves swirling gracefully, like fairies dancing, but by afternoon we had great stampedes of dead leaves rushing across the mountain sides, sometimes towards us sometimes in front of us but always fiercely. We heard trees cracking and even falling during the day. George Ferris told us one tree fell across the trail ahead of him…a few seconds later and he would have been under it. Kerry read the wind got up to 65 miles per hour and it was scary!
We passed another gravesite today…it even had a plaque that directed us to the Shelton Graves in North Carolina There seems to be a bit of a mystery to this, but it involves Union soldiers returning home and being killed by Confederates. This is worth googling…just more than I can include here.
Later in the day, I sat down beside a stream whilst Kerry took a photo, but when I got up, Felix jumped up beside me, and I, tangled in his leash fell face first into the stream, Felix beside me. The water was cold and kept cool for a while.
We thought we would stop at Hogback Ridge Shelter but when we got there, we found there were a lot of 20 something young men, who weren’t friendly…not on purpose, just into their own thing so we decided to head for this hostel: Nature’s Inn. Unfortunately, they neglected to tell us that there was no power, so no showers or clean clothes. Apparently, the wind has caused widespread power outages in the area so I’m writing this in the dark.

Tuffbabie had finished her wash in the night, obviously worried about the same thing. At 6:30, we gave up on sleep and got showered, which helped drive the cobwebs away…had some coffee and wandered over to the lodge where Amy arrived bearing a bribe (she felt bad about the power outage) in the form of sausage, egg and cheese biscuit sandwiches and potato rounds from Bojangles…this immediately made me think sadly of our last dinner with Zen, the Gooder Grove Hostel owner who died suddenly a couple of weeks ago. 
Breakfast was good and filling and persuaded me to hold my tongue with Amy. I had spent the night thinking about how to politely let her know that she should have told us about the power outage before she took us in.
That settled, we had another lovely hiking day today. It started very cold, but as I’ve said before, blue skies change everything and we walked happily along up and down the sides of mountains, seeing pretty much the same scenery we’ve seen for the past 3 plus weeks. Today, the sky was so clear that we had the best view yet of the distant mountain ridges forming a continuous line of navy blue against the lighter spring sky. 
Felix provided a new service today, he was so happy, he literally dragged me up a couple of the aforementioned mountains. It was difficult to contain his enthusiasm.
I walk and I sometimes wonder what I’m thinking about, but mostly I don’t think I’m thinking…I’m just walking, listening to the leaves rustle either in the wind or beneath my feet, the birds are singing more now and the woodpeckers peck, and the ambient sound of the forest that sounds like a whisper to my ears.
We had more icefall from the trees today…at first I thought it was pollen then I realized that wasn’t possible. We went high (5156ft at the Big Bald….such imaginative names!) and it was so cold up there that the trees held on to the moisture until the sun warming it up caused it fall on us in a little snowstorm. There was also a lot of black slippery mud. We’ve also had this for days; it’s treacherous and caused us more than a few near misses in the fall department!
We arrived at the shelter at 5:30, alone. We decided to camp, hoping that the predicted rain doesn’t come before we’re up and moving in the morning. Erwin tomorrow.
One more thing, there were signs all over warning us to store our food away from the bears, but there were no cables at the shelter nor any useful trees for hanging food. Fortunately, we had one more option…”the dog method”. Please, no caustic comments. Bears don’t like dogs and we really had no options…Felix slept next to the food bag in our tent and we had no problems. It’s possible his presence helped the other hikers who also had no options!

Short hiking day today, but a busy one!
We awoke to a brilliant rose colored sunrise, the best we’ve seen so far. The sky began to fill with a high ceiling cloud cover but none of the promised early morning rain. In fact, the hiking weather was very pleasant and we didn’t have far to go, just 6.2 miles to Erwin. 
We descended from the mountains with amazing views of the Nolachucky River, an impressive body of water and although I’ve failed to mention it before, we have been surprised by the number of the large rivers we’ve passed along the way. I’m not sure what I expected but this is quite different from the west coast.
At Uncle Johnny’s, Drew and crew were very nice but they had no cabins available for us. So we walked another mile plus to the Mountain View Inn. There we finally met Mango (who contacted me through my journal guestbook) and his wife Jane. Mango knows our friend Shroomer from California and another friend, Ron, from Oregon but we had never met. They took us out to lunch at a local Mexican restaurant and then to Walmart to get some resupply. That was very helpful, but what made Kerry feel like a new man was going to a barber shop for a complete trim: hair, beard and mustache…he feels like he can eat again unimpeded! In between all this, we heard about Mango’s trail travels, sometimes supported by Jane. It’s hard for me to describe how amazing and kind people can be to two complete strangers. We feel so fortunate.
The dilemma for tomorrow is that we’d like to take a day off but it looks like the only day of the week without a solid promise of rain. So, We reserved a cabin at Johnny’s for tomorrow night, since they told us they have one available, and a ride through Steve (Unicoi Shuttle) to Iron Mountain for a 20 mile slack pack back to Uncle Johnny’s. Tuffbabie had already arranged a shuttle, so we will join her.
Now, time to add to our calorie load….dinner!","No Business Knob Shelter

As planned, we slack packed the 20 plus miles from Iron Mountain Gap back to Uncle Johnny’s. It was another lovely mostly sunny day when we set out. Same terrain, but we did go through some conifer forest with lots of moss on the trees, pine needles on the ground that were soft to walk on and smelled of old forest. We will soon leave the evergreens behind. 
Today is the first day of our fifth week on the trail. The scenery has been somewhat consistent with the tall naked trees stretched heavenward. I’m not tired of it because I know it will soon be gone, giving way to the real leafy spring. 
Eventually, we climbed over Mt Unaka, which was treeless and grassy on top with views in every direction. We noticed trees at lower elevations are beginning to get leaves and some red buds are in bloom. The season is changing but we are told that this can change very quickly. We are not out of the woods, yet, so to speak. 
The rhododendron forests continue; I love the way the sunlight dapples the ground through the leaves…I’m hoping we will get to see them bloom before we leave them behind, with any luck we’ll still be walking through them in Virginia.
At Indian Grave Gap, we had trail magic from Brother Tom: lemonade for me and Arnold Palmer for Kerry and 1/2 slice of cranberry bread each!We got to Uncle Johnny’s by 4 p.m. This was very good time for us; I chalked it up to no packs and fine weather. 
The weather outlook for tomorrow has improved, so we’re hoping for another good day. We’re sitting around a fire pit drinking beer and the light is fading. Felix is sleeping at my feet, with a full belly and happy to be still. I am too.
The moon looks full.

It didn’t rain (yet) today. G-man told us the weather forecast had changed and it was not supposed to rain. He drove Jenn, Tuffbabie and the three of us back to Iron Mountain Gap so we could continue our journey North. On the way, he stopped so we could buy coffee…heaven.
At the trailhead, we all separated fairly quickly, hiking at different paces and like yesterday, we were soon on our own. Naturally, like most of our days we started on a steep upward climb, followed at some point by a steep downhill plunge. This sequence was repeated multiple times during the day, just as it is every day!
The sky was an ever changing swirl of clouds and sunlight; clouds of white and grey and every shade in between. Kerry has become quite good at smelling when the rain is coming, My very own rain meter, but he didn’t smell rain today. He took a lovely photo of the swirling white clouds through the naked trees. I know he will try to post it but all his best photos get rejected because they are too big. 
We’ve been noticing some interesting mushrooms attached to the trees. They look like barnacles attached to rocks, and they’re hard/calcified like them too. I wonder how they got that way, they must have been mushrooms once.
We had wonderful wildflowers today….little pink and white petaled flowers lined the path in many places and the sun lit their tiny faces. We just kept walking until about 5 p.m. when we arrived here and thought it was a good time to stop. We’re getting stronger, but not faster and that’s ok….the walking just is.
There are three other people in the shelter tonight: Oz, whom we have met before, Catherine/Catorito, a young woman from Raleigh, NC  and Solo Grandpa from Massachusetts who wants to complete the trail by July 15. He’s going at a good pace so he might do it too! We’re here because it might just rain.","Iron Mountain Gap

Catorito warned us last night that she gets up about 5 a.m. I wasn’t paying enough attention, because I was a little surprised to hear her rustling around in the dark. Kerry and I like to get going early, but we’re not big on hiking in the dark. We tried to pretend ourselves to sleep, but finally gave in and got up at 5:30. We were ready to move out at 6:25 (as was the other two hikers) but it was still dark. If we tried really hard, we could imagine daylight coming. Nothing for it but for Kerry to turn on his headlight and lead us up the trail. I followed him in the dark in the firm belief that I could sense, if not seethe gloaming coming. By 7 a.m., indeed we had day!
We planned to come into this hostel tonight because the weather forecast a big storm but as G-man told us yesterday, the mountains create unpredictable weather. We didn’t have rain yesterday and only a couple of splashes today. The big storm is supposed to come tomorrow. I’m hoping that it won’t prevent us from moving on.
In the meantime, we signed up for the buffet breakfast this hostel is known for and we’ve spent the afternoon trying to catch up with some things we couldn’t pre-arrange before we left. It’s a bizarre feeling, like being caught between worlds…that other life goes on but it’s hard for us to relate. Everything for us revolves around the scenery, the weather, food, water and where will we sleep.
We only walked 11 miles today, naturally lots of up, followed by lots of down to get here. That means tomorrow, we’ll be starting straight up again. Both today and yesterday, the high places included “balds.” These are relatively high mountains, five to six thousand feet that lack trees on top, and from a distance, they do look bald. The wind blows hard up there and if the sky is clear, the views are amazing. To be honest, I would like to have kept walking, but we’ve walked 50 miles in the last 2 1/2 days, so a rest and refuel is probably best.","Stan Murray Shelter

I did not sleep very well, again. We got up about 6:30 a.m., unable to continue sleeping. We got ourselves ready for another slack packing day in the rain and then headed for the main house where the famous breakfast would be served. A number of hikers had told us about Mountain Harbor and this is why we had come…and it turned out its reputation was well deserved. Mountains of interesting food that was all homemade, a veritable feast. 
After breakfast, we shuttled to FS 293, and started the walk back to the hostel. Although rain had been predicted, it had not yet to come and for the first hour or so, we walked under high fog-colored clouds that didn’t seem particularly threatening. That didn’t last long, first the sky started spitting at us sporadically, but it didn’t take long to turn into a gentle downpour which stayed with us for most of the day. In Gatlinburg we had purchased Rab rain pants and jackets and this was a good opportunity to test them out. We also wore our neoprene socks and everything worked well. We were still fairly dry and comfortable at the end of the day. And tomorrow, more rain is coming so we will have a chance to try it all again.
The rain pattered on our heads and on the ground, a special kind of music to walk to, but the biggest surprise, miracle really, was that looking through the rain today, for the first time, on those brown skyward reaching arms of naked trees, we could see green buds happening, almost as we watched. Not everywhere, but in swathes of trees, like a green fog rising. It was uplifting, even whilst the rain through a wet blanket over everything.
Eventually, we arrived back at the hostel. I am hoping for better sleep tonight. It will be another cold wet day tomorrow!

Another final breakfast at Mountain Harbor Hostel and a final conversation with Can and Doug whose 18 year old daughter woke up very cold last night and walked from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m to get to the hostel. I’m feeling a bit wistful about some of the lovely people we meet. I find myself thinking we might be friends under other circumstances, but as it is, we meet briefly, and we never see them again.
Mary, the hostel owner drove Flipper, Checkmate and us back to FS 293 and we started North and uphill, naturally, at 9:30ish we expected rain, and we got it but not so much as I thought we’d have. It was supposed to rain most of the day and stop toward evening. This is why we are camped atop another mountain, in anticipation of the return of the sun tomorrow.
As we walked down to Dennis Cove Trailhead, we started hearing gunshots, we didn’t think much of it at first but it continued off and on throughout the afternoon and we were a little concerned that we weren’t dressed in bright colors for hunting season.
This afternoon we walked quite a way on a fairly level path along the banks of the Laurel River. Like all the rivers we’ve seen, it was running fast and furiously, swollen with the recent rains. We also saw Laurel Falls. The white churning water was crashing down; it was quite a sight. And as we walked up the mountain beside the River, we were treated to white dogwoods abloom and even a wild azalea in pink. Meanwhile, the River below us appeared to swell to the breadth of a lake, so we wondered if it was dammed.
We decided to camp here in this identified campsite, but when we got here, there were 3 young men already here: Dan, who hiked the Florida Trail in 2020 and his friends, Jordan and Kenneth who have never camped before. I know this will sound odd, but I think these are the first people we’ve interacted with in the last month who are not in some way connected to the trail. It was refreshing.

At 11 p.m. last night, we awoke to raindrops. This put me in fire (or should I say “rain”) drill mode, but Kerry assured me it wouldn’t last, and he was right. As promised by the weather forecasters, we wakened to clear blue skies and 32 degrees.
We slept in until 6:40. Kerry was cold because something is wrong with the zipper on his sleeping bag and it isn’t staying closed…we’ll have to deal with that in Damascus. On the bright side, we pulled Felix up between us in the night and he’s like a very hot, hot water bottle…kept us (including himself) all warmer.
Anyway, we wakened to the sound of owls all around us. We’ve heard them before, but not these and we couldn’t identify them. I meant to mention that we are hearing more birdsong  over the last week. Together with the trees starting to green, our world is starting to wake up. On our walk around the lake we saw more dogwoods in bloom, as well as Red Buds and an entire hillside of deep blue larkspur.
The other sound we were a little shocked to hear early on Easter Sunday, here in the Bible Belt was the sound of guns firing, again. I just couldn’t get my head wrapped around it. 
Once we came down the mountain this morning, we spent a couple of hours walking around the lake, which is dammed and named Lake Watauga. We eventually walked over Wilbur Dam, which apparently dams the Watauga River, not the Laurel River. Then we climbed back up to the ridgeline where we continued our journey around the lake. We spent most of the day doing this and were very tired…not sure why, but we were more than ready to stop.
Here we are on yet another high mountain side and a promise of more freezing temperatures! Still the day was bright and sunny and I can’t think of a better way to spend Easter Sunday,

We awoke at 6:15 a.m. to another blue sky and freezing temperatures. We spent the entire  day hiking up and down on the ridgeline so it lacked the intensity of hiking up and down mountains, but was hard work, never the less.
By 9:30 or so it felt like we were on a highway of hikers. Apparently, they were slack packing from Boots Off Hostel….maybe ten of them, including Jenn who told us she plans to get to Damascus Wednesday morning. We tentatively made plans to get in touch so we could say, “goodbye”. She is leaving at Damascus and returning to the trail somewhere North in late May/early June to continue the trail she’s not yet hiked. It’s funny, she started walking about the same time we did, and she is the one person we’ve consistently run into every few days or so. Feeling a bit wistful about saying, “goodbye.”
At Cross Mountain/TN 91 we met Trail angels Richard and Lori (retired army and Air Force, respectively) from Elizabethton. They were just packing up but they served us homemade jambalaya, bratwurst and Gatorade. Even Felix scored two bratwurst. He was a happy dog, although he did growl unkindly at Richard. I told him, Felix, not to be rude!
That meal gave us a huge energy burst for the rest of the day. We are now less than 10 miles from Damascus and looking forward to taking a day off there.
The trees are a little greener every day, it’s like a fog that is settling in. It’s so gradual I have a feeling we will just wake up one day and everywhere will be green. For now, I’m watching one day at a time and feeling a little sad that soon the season will truly change and there will be no going back. Although I have to admit I won’t miss the cold! And I really prefer to look out a window at the rain.

Much warmer this morning…in the 50s. We were motivated to hike the last 10 miles to Damascus and we did, arriving at about noon. At about 10 a.m., we left Tennessee and entered Virginia, our fourth state at mile 467.
In Damascus, we needed to find a place to stay and something to eat. The latter proved challenging as it seems that on Tuesdays and Wednesdays a lot of places are closed….someone didn’t get that message to the AT hikers who don’t walk on a schedule but tend to show up all the time for many months of the year.
We did eventually find a decent hamburger at a place called Cowboys, whose patrons were of enormous size, probably starting at about 250lbs. After that and several phone calls, I was able to secure us a private room at the Dancing Bear Inn for 2 nights. We haven’t had a day off for almost 3 weeks and we are both looking forward to a day of rest tomorrow. Elizabeth, who checked us in also washed our clothes and helped us access the TV (we’d like to catch upon the news, maybe?), seems very helpful and kind. She even bemoaned the businesses that don’t seem to cater to “the tourists” upon whom Damascus thrives.
The tips on Kerry’s poles were warm away and Lumpy at Mt. Rogers Outfitters changed them for him at no charge. I couldn’t believe it, but he said that Leki gives him the tips so he feels it’s a service for him to fix them. One problem solved, two to go. Kerry will probably need to replace his backpack, it’s falling apart, but that’s for tomorrow. The final issue is the zipper on his sleeping bag, and Western Mountaineering has given us detailed instructions on how to fix that. Hoping that works.
So the only thing left for tonight was our evening meal at the Diner. Whilst we were there,  Rick (from last night’s campsite) came over to talk to us. He and his Eagle Scout friends are hiking the AT together. Apparently, last night, Rick who is 55 asked Kerry if he, at 70, had any words of wisdom for him. After demurring, Kerry told him 3 things: 1) from a spiritual perspective , to love God above all else, and love one another. 2) from Socrates, “know thyself” 3) and the 2 most important things, learned from our dog are: loyalty and to turn around 3 times before lying down to sleep (someone probably said this but he doesn’t know who). This surprised me a little, but Kerry is philosophical.

We enjoyed a nice breakfast at the Damascus Diner and shared our table with Rick, Clay and Nathan, who plan to end this section hike in 30 miles.
A much needed day off the trail, but we had a lot to get done. Kerry replaced his old broken Ohm ULA pack with a new updated one. Lumpy at Mt. Rogers Outfitters even gave him a 10% discount, unasked for. Kerry thought about buying one of the waterproof packs, but he just likes the design of this one, so that’s what he got. He was able to fix the sleeping bag with instruction from Gary at Western Mountaineering and he replaced the dyneema rope for hanging the bear bag, with paracord, so we are all set.
We were able to deal with some personal matters that needed following up on and Elizabeth took us to the grocery store so we’re ready for the next leg of our journey. Elizabeth told us she and her husband moved here 3 years ago and purchased the Dancing Bear Inn as a part of their retirement plan. She loves it here, and has been so kind to us, and other hikers, I’m sure.
Jenn arrived in Damascus today, she ends her journey for now and will get back on the trail in Pennsylvania in early June. We had a beer with her at the local tavern and said “goodbye.” Maybe our paths will cross again…I hope so.
We also saw Karen and Steve one more time as they also end their hike here. We’ve enjoyed meeting and talking with everyone and it’s sad to see them go. Enough goodbyes for now!
This seems a good time to mention trail names. Kerry’s is “Clueless,” and no, I didn’t give it to him, although I must say, “if the shoe fits, wear it!” Our friend, Just Some Dude, gave it to him a few years ago, and now it seems to have stuck. Felix is “the little prince” and sometimes he’s “the grumpy little prince” because he lets us know when other hikers show up. Right before we came here my friend Don said I should be “Elf”….he had his reasons but when I thought about it, it sort of works…the Tolkien movie elves are very old and have long white hair like me. Then someone else called me “Co-Pilot” and that works too, so the jury is still out for me!

We got off to a good start today…a mile or so walk through Damascus, which is a pretty little town. It’s main logging industry ended in the 60s and now the people who live here depend on tourism for survival; not just AT hikers, but bikers and other outdoor recreational activities that people participate in. Soon after leaving the town border, we headed up the mountainside once more. The endless walk down the mountain on the South side coming into Damascus 2 days ago was now repeated going up on the North side of town. Once we reached the ridge line it was up and down about 500 feet all day. But some of the walking was fairly easy, following a river at one point for a few miles and watching the fast flowing water run it’s course from our perch above was soothing.
We saw some new wildflowers today, red ones that I don’t have a name for. We also saw some more wild iris…to me they are magical. Also, today, for the first time I noticed that the rhododendrons are not looking wilted and woebegone anymore, but the leaves are standing straight out like they are supposed to. They seem to inhabit a band of elevation that spans some depth either side of 3000 feet. Where they grow, they dominate. We walk through them, tall as trees and frequently, they arch over us and we walk through a tunnel of them, the sun dancing on their leaves and on the ground.
A lot of people (young) passed us today, but we just kept walking. We decided not to stay in the last shelter we passed and walked on to this campsite. We were just settling in when Possum a recent retiree from North Carolina showed up, so the three of us are camped here, a little worried about bears showing up: there are ominous signs posted in strategic locations by the Forest Service just to make sure we stay worried. Food has been hung as best we could, and we’re counting on Felix to warn us if any bears show up.
I don’t listen to music or audio books or anything while we walk but lots of things go through my head that I think I should write about later and which in general I promptly forget but today I was ruminating the problem of being a female of a certain age (old) and the difficulty of having to squat for various reasons. This may be TMI, but it’s quite a challenge. I’m in pretty good shape but getting up from a sitting in mid air position is not easy. I suppose without furniture, men and women in the past used these muscles constantly and they probably remained fairly adept all their short lives. This may be one of the reasons why my aunt once said to me that old age isn’t for Sissies. I know this is a ridiculous thing to think about but so it goes.
Darkness has fallen, dog’s already passed out. Kerry put the rain flaps out because there is a chance of rain. I’m happy to be back on the soft, flat forest floor instead of a lumpy bed. Long walk today, I think I’ll sleep.","Damascus. Dancing Bear Inn

We had every intention of getting an early start and making good progress today, but we awakened to rain that didn’t let up until 7:30 so it was slow going packing up and we didn’t start walking until almost 9. The hiking was fairly intense, we climbed 2 mountains, White Top and Mt. Rogers and ended the day at 5436 ft, well below the summits we climbed to, a net gain of more than 2,000 feet but total elevation gain had to be at least double that.
The weather improved and then reverted back and forth throughout the day. More chance of rain tonight but one thing Kerry and I agree on (and there seems to be more these days!) is that sleeping on the ground is more restful than on a hard shelter floor and also we sleep better on our own. So here we are in a field hoping the weather will be kind (30 to 50 percent chance of rain this evening) and that we will wake up to a nice day.
We were fortunate this afternoon to stop at the road that passes through Elk Garden and the wind was blowing hard, so I took the tent out and let the wind blow it dry. It was great, probably took a lb off Kerry’s carrying weight too.
We’re back to naked trees, maybe a microclimate or just the elevation. The ground however is popping green; grass, little ferns and leaves….not to mention the wildflowers…more everyday. The views have not changed, but the ground has become a little more rocky, I’ve noticed this over the last week, but now we’re seeing more boulders and interesting rock formations. There are also more open spaces, where the grass grows and you look across to the unending undulating outline of blue mountains, it’s quite something and we’ve been looking at it for 6 weeks now!
Our biggest treat of the day was to see 3 wild ponies on the side of Mt. Rogers. They seemed oblivious to us, as animals tend to be in protected habitats, but it was very special. Felix wasn’t bothered by them either, he doesn’t herd horses. These ponies looked very healthy, a beautiful chestnut color with long white mains, much longer than you see on domestic horses so I wonder if the latters’ are trimmed.
One thing I know for sure…it will be colder tonight!

Today was a memorable day. We saw lots of animals. As promised the ponies of the Grayson Highlands turned out in force. We saw 12 altogether; 9 feeding right beside and on the trail. One of them nuzzled my hand when I walked toward her thinking she would move to the side so I could pass. She did eventually move but rather grudgingly…I think she wanted a treat. This happened to us once in Northern England on our Sea to Sea hike, but the horse only moved when we gave him an apple! As we walked along, we saw three more individual ponies, one of them again in the middle of the trail. Emboldened by my earlier encounter, I put my hand out and petted it on its head, then for good measure I rubbed her nose. Her head came up to my chest, so they weren’t large as far as ponies are concerned. They call them wild animals, but I think that must only be to distinguish them from domestic animals: a more gentle beast I can’t imagine. Felix even let them smell him and nuzzle him with their noses, he didn’t seem put out in the least!
The other animals we saw today, a rabbit (my first on this trip) and three white-tailed deer naturally drove Felix to distraction. I’m so glad I have Felix on a 4 foot leash….he nearly went airborne when he caught sight of the deer with their amazing tails held in the air like white flags. As well-trained as Felix is, it’s just impossible to disconnect his lizard brain when it kicks in. He turns into a wild animal!
Since I’m talking about animals, we did see a few more birds today, but I didn’t get close enough to identify them. There is also this funny looking centipede (millipede?) we keep seeing too.
When we started down Mt. Rogers and into Grayson Highlands, we were literally walking inside a cloud. As we walked downward, the cloud began to rise above us and we had nice views across the open grasslands. We also walked up and down a couple of mountains again, one of them was Pine Mountain, and I don’t remember the others, they come so fast and they don’t all have signs to tell us. We’re currently 2000 feet lower than we were last night, here near Dickey Gap. 
The weather forecast is for rain tonight and tomorrow but the sky was blue when the sunset, so I pray it stays that way. It’s dark now and late for me at 8:30 but Kerry is off somewhere trying to put a bear bag in a suitable tree which is almost impossible to find. He just returned….after numerous unsuccessful attempts to hang it, the bear bag is staying with us, and Felix will have to warn us if trouble arrives.

I’m just starting to write, it’s almost 8 p.m., and getting dark. When we started out on this journey, over a month ago, the clocks hadn’t changed and it was quite dark by 6:30. p.m. So, were I in the tent, I’d probably be snuggled up asleep by now. As it is, Kerry and I came into Marion to wash up and avoid another downpour so I’m happy to report that Kerry had his beer and we both had a good meal, a wash and clean clothes.
We hadn’t originally planned to come here, but with the rain, and an easy resupply it made sense for us to do so. I forgot to mention we went over the 500 mile mark yesterday!
A follow-up on last night’s lack of a bear bag hang. Felix, sleeping on the bear bag woke us up at about 11 p.m. with a couple of soft warning barks and growl. He did this a couple of times. Kerry got up to look for trouble, but not finding any we all went back to sleep without further concern. 
In the morning, we got up and packed up quickly and so did the campers around us, I think everyone wanted to get ahead of the storm. It was pleasant hiking and the sun burned the grey away, The promised rain came several hours later than predicted which allowed us to get to Marion without being totally drenched.
While the terrain and vistas have not changed, There is something about the hiking since Damascus that has become more gentle, less harsh. I can’t quite explain why because the mountain climbing has been just as steep, more in some cases. Perhaps it is the ridges, some of them, have been more…predictable. This probably doesn’t make much sense, it’s my body that knows it.
I love butterflies and we have seen quite a few, swallowtails and something that looks like a mourning cloak. We’ve also been seeing a black butterfly with a blue tinge and blue spots on its bottom edge. Kerry finally managed to get a photo of it today. It’s called a spicebush swallowtail. I probably won’t be able to upload his photo, for some reason all his photos are coming out too large to upload, he promised to try and fix it!
Back to the trail tomorrow!

Perfect weather today. It was fairly cold, in the 40s, I think, with the wind chill. This made climbing mountains more comfortable since we didn’t overheat! We started the day climbing the required two mountains and then the terrain changed to the gentler landscape we’d been promised. We started going downhill and walking beside streams on a fairly level plane all the way to Atkins environs. We saw scattered farmhouses along the way, including a farmhouse museum from the 1890s. We ate lunch there. On the whole, I would describe the scene as rural and pastoral.
After Atkins, we had some more hills to climb, but nothing to dampen our enthusiasm. We had good energy today, and I’m beginning think it’s connected to having a good meal (which we did in Marion). Kerry has lost 25 lbs…he could afford to lose a few, well quite a few, but he can’t keep this up, so we’re going to have to figure out a way to eat more. To that end when came to a gas station in Atkins, we did indulge: Kerry had a smoothie and a hot chocolate and I had a chocolate milkshake!
Today, whilst up high, we’re still seeing the bare trees of winter, but spring would come and go from elevation to elevation as we went down and up. As we got closer to farmland, we saw more bushes and trees leafing out, including a bush that glittered silver when the sun shone on it. It was covered in little white flowers that permeated the air where the bush prevailed. They smelled heavenly. We also saw white violets for the first time. Most of the wildflowers are tiny and carpet the ground.
After 5 in the afternoon, we were walking on a ridge when I saw a black gnarled stick in my path. As I moved my foot to get around it, it moved…scared me half to death! It was a 6 ft long blackish colored snake. I will look it up when we next have internet. Kerry has seen them before…not a poisonous snake, but quite large. My scare also scared Felix, he showed no inclination to check out the snake. I think Kerry got some good photos too.
I forgot the most momentous thing: we past the first quarter, almost 550 miles, of our journey to Maine. Just 1650 miles to go!
Kerry just announced the food has been hung, the dog is already sound asleep. We’re going to sleep in a rhododendron forest: first time for me! It shouldn’t be too cold tonight, but camped beside the creek may be damp and we may be in a cold sink. We’ll find out soon enough!

We lost Felix for 2 1/2 hours today. It was terrifying and devastating. He was traveling beside me when we came to a log in the middle of the trail, I let go of the leash to allow Felix to go under it, whilst I went over the top. Unfortunately, he got under the log faster than I got over it and in the meantime one of those wiley white-tailed deer came along and practically waived that tail like a white flag right at Felix. This was too much for him and he took after it before I could grab the leash and that was that! The moral of this story? Never trust a dog once their instincts kick in. Since it was deer he followed he probably traveled several miles before deciding he needed us more than the deer. 2 1/2 hours later he came walking back up the trail, winded, thirsty and ready for a nap, which he didn’t get. We lost 5 miles today and might have lost the dog as well. Needless to say, Kerry and I are now hyper vigilant of where the leash is when climbing over things and related activities and Felix is in the doghouse, so to speak.
We were actually off to a good start this morning when this happened, but Felix’s shenanigans (yes, it was my fault for not hanging on to him), put a bit of dampener on an otherwise perfect day. The sun shining, wind blowing, rural Virginia, mountains to climb, who could ask for anything more?
We were told there was not much in the way of trail magic in Virginia, but at one of the road crossings we came too there were two lovely blond ladies handing out Gatorade and homemade cookies and muffins. It turned out they were from Oklahoma. When I asked what they were doing here, they responded they were here to visit their husbands who are hiking the AT. Sharon is married to the Okie and Angela is married to McDuck, both also journalists on trail journals. Kerry and I felt very lucky to benefit from their kindness. They traveled 15 hours by car to get here!
Up the trail, we met 81 year-old, Lumbermac, who runs Appalachian Grandma’s Hostel, out for a walk. He told us he hoped to still be walking at 90 and he’d be happy to be found dead by a tree on the trail rather than sitting in a recliner watching TV. He also left trail magic at the road crossing, but we missed it because it was a bit hidden from Northbounders. He seemed like a nice man.
The two Daves and Superior passed us at some point…for now we keep running into them. Eventually they too will disappear; we’re slower, we just walk longer hours.
Late in the day, for the first time, we took our shoes off to ford a creek where the bridge was out, The cool water was soothing to our feet, We saw more of the ubiquitous blooming dogwood trees all day but also some new ones flowering out at these lower elevations. We heard birds singing and saw more swallowtail butterflies, both the yellow ones and the spicebush. It’s still winter higher up, but spring is coming!","Reed Creek

Another perfect hiking day. But I take it back about Virginia being more gentle, it’s not. I think I confused the pastoral scenes of the last two days with less mountainous, but on balance, we still had bunch of mountains to climb. I discovered that we were walking through miles of easements on private land; that would explain the rolling grasslands!
This morning, we walked from our starting elevation at 2575 feet to more than 4407 at Chestnut Knob shelter, 4 miles away, but most of the elevation gain was in the first 3 miles. Once we reached 4500 or so we walked ridgelines up and down most of the day, which was very warm. I started thinking those trees leafing out sooner than later would be a good thing, a little shade relief would be fine! 
At the road crossing to Burke’s Hostel. There was a man, “Wrongway”, who hiked the AT in 2019. He offered us each a coke, which we accepted gratefully. I had just been thinking how great it would be to have a coke, and there it was. I told him he made my day! It almost made up for our skipping the hostel (yes, I’m still annoyed at Felix about that!)
So then, of course, having descended to the road, we now had to climb another mountain to return to the ridgeline. Im really not complaining, this is what we do, I’m kind of getting used to it and having lovely weather helps…I am not looking forward to the next bout of rain.
One interesting phenomenon that Kerry pointed out was that among the rocks we were walking on and through, some had at one time been tree roots, but time and water had mineralized them and they had turned to stone. He regrets he didn’t get a photo but I hope to see them again so he can.
We’re looking forward to a real meal tomorrow…some hikers told us about a place near the trail called, “the Outpost” on the outskirts of Bland. Then we have to figure out when to get our next resupply. The towns seem fairly close together so there are a lot of options.
Time for sleep!

It seems like most mornings we begin our days climbing a mountain or two and today was no exception. However, we had motivation to climb that mountain quickly. We were told that the Outpost only served breakfast until 10 a.m. and we had 6.9 miles to go.  Kerry loves breakfast and he had his heart set on this so we walked those almost 7 miles and arrived at 9:40 a.m…..record time for us and probably not repeatable. But Kerry got his breakfast: egg, sausage and an enormous biscuit with gravy on top. The latter is not his favorite, but that was what was on offer and he cleaned his plate. This was not what you would call a normal restaurant operation. The guy taking orders was reminiscent of Seinfeld’s Soup Nazi, but a bit nicer. I had a 3 egg omelette with lots of good stuff inside. I don’t normally like eggs that much either, but like Kerry, I ate every scrap. All this plus orange juice, coffee, 20 oz coke and Gatorade between us and two BLTs to go for our dinner tonight, which we also enjoyed. We are trying, rather hopelessly I’m afraid to catch up a little on the calorie deficit.
After eating, we tackled the next 13 miles with gusto…..since we came down for breakfast, we of course had to climb another mountain to reach the ridgeline once more. Before leaving cell coverage, I made a reservation at Angels Rest Hostel, in Pearisburg, for 2 nights in a private room beginning Saturday….it’s now 32.2 miles ahead. It’s supposed to start raining early Saturday morning, but at least we can get dry in the evening.
The trees are mostly leafing out now, a bright delightful green that reflects the sun but has its own radiant light. They haven’t fully leafed out so the sun still keeps us hot most of the day. Occasionally, we walk through one of those dense rhododendron forests I mentioned and that is cool and feels like heaven.
One thing we’re seeing less of is ground water, up until yesterday, I rarely had to pour water for Felix, but now I have to stop and pour some into his dish because it’s been so dry. Up until now, and since Zen’s Gooder Grove Hostel near the beginning, I’ve only been carrying 1 1/2 liters of water to Kerry’s 2. Someone either accidentally or possibly deliberately, switched my 1 liter bottle for a 1/2 liter. Until now it hasn’t mattered but I think in Pearisburg, I’ll get a new 1 liter Smart water bottle. We can’t have Felix getting thirsty!
We’re by a stream, at the bottom of a valley again tonight, so I’m anticipating that mountain we will climb first thing in the morning. This our 4th night in a row in the tent and we are really enjoying it. Especially so tonight because we were able to find our own camping spot where we can’t even see other people.
Felix is asleep and I see Kerry has hung the bear bag, and it’s still light so we will have an early night tonight!

We got off to an early start because we decided that going into a hostel might be more enjoyable than waking up and trying to pack up in the predicted rain. The only hitch being that said hostel would require us to walk more than 20 miles, a bit of a stretch for us. 
It may or may not rain early tomorrow, but we are going to bed having eaten a real meal (offered by the hostel), which included a large helping of salad greens grown in the garden….just what we needed! Woods Hole Hostel is apparently the oldest on the AT, it is run by the original owner’s granddaughter, Neville, who seems very nice. She made us all stand in a circle and give our names and what we were thankful for. A nice touch but a little more touchy-feely than I like.
Today was a long, but rather nice day. It started when about 1/2 mile from our camp spot, we ran into Sticks packing up. He told us he was ending his planned section hike today. It turns out he is a pilot for United Airlines and active duty military in the reserves. When he returns to his car, he has a 7 1/2 hour drive home to New Jersey and his wife. Then tomorrow he reports in for military service. We enjoyed talking to him for a couple of hours, then we all walked the 1/2 mile or so to Trent’s Grocery for breakfast (Kerry had a sausage and egg sandwich and Felix and I each had a hot dog…all washed down with coke and Gatorade) and wrapped up our conversation with Sticks. He then drove us back to the trailhead. So, today if one were to include the side trip to the grocery and to the hostel, we actually walked 22 miles, which is rather a lot.
After we climbed the required mountains, we had a level walk for maybe 8 miles or so. Perhaps this is the bit, or one of the bits, people refer to when they say Virginia is flatter? Although 8 miles of flat in 530 or so does not, I think, qualify the state for that descriptor. That said, we’ll see what the next 400 or so miles hold!
But the “flat” walking was wonderful: nice duffy ground to walk on, tunnels of rhododendron forests to keep the hot sun off us and lovely babbling brooks to walk beside. It was idyllic. Then we climbed another mountain!  
The ground was quite rocky in places, in the higher elevations especially. There is still not enough green in the trees to provide real shade but a periodic breeze made us a little more comfortable. Every day a little more of the forest disappears behind the green as more shrubs and young trees leaf out. More birds are singing, more butterflies flitting and quite a lot of large bees traveling around the trail at foot level. Felix is on constant alert for animals and smells so we remain very vigilant with him. He didn’t eat much food today and I’m wondering if he just doesn’t like the brand or if the puppy food is too rich for him. We’ll see how he does tomorrow. 
Shorter walk to Pearisburg tomorrow, 12 plus miles, but we won’t start until mid morning probably because Kerry wants a proper breakfast and that won’t be served until after 8 a.m. Meanwhile, I’m hoping for a good night’s sleep before our walk in the rain!

 We awoke a little after 6 a.m. to a great crashing sound on the roof. The promised storm had arrived. Kerry said he woke a little earlier to some gentler rain sounds but this woke me up quite dramatically. We were happy to be under a roof and not in the tent! 
We had coffee and breakfast with the other hikers, settled our account and took off to rejoin the trail at close to 10 a.m. The main storm seemed to have passed but we walked up another mountain to the ridgeline where the cloud sat on us, then drizzled rain on us to make sure we didn’t get too comfortable. After awhile we dropped back into the rhododendron forest and the cloud stayed above us for awhile but didn’t go away. The remarkable part of the walk was when we finally got close to Pearisburg and started descending rapidly, it was like crossing into another country. The forest turned green: the understory of shrubs and ground cover, the trees, the rocks and everything was lit in that bright green that seems to create its own light, the light of spring.
We saw lots of wildflowers, and for the first time, I saw a small lump of bluebells!I meant to comment about all the falls I keep having. I hesitate to even bring it up because i feel I’m tempting fate and so far I’ve been very lucky. The problem seems to be that when my backpack starts moving in one direction or another, I have no choice but to go with it. I’ve been lucky that so far all I have is bruises to show for it and I hope it stays that way because I don’t see my mishaps going away.

We were going to take a zero day today, but Kerry didn’t want to lose a sunny day sitting around when we could be walking, so we slack packed from Peter’s Mountain Trailhead. It was a glorious day but it started out a bit iffy, weather-wise. The first part of the hike required us to climb Peter’s Mountain, but once we got to the top we hiked most of the day on the more or less gentle curve of the ridgeline. My friend, Arthur told me that he worked extensively on part of this trail in the 70s, so it was especially fun to see what began as some of his handiwork!
In the morning, Mike from the hostel shuttled us up to Peter’s Mountain Trailhead. As we crossed the New River, we saw a low cloud hanging along the length of the river; it was quite magical. I didn’t know then, that I would cross the bridge over the river on foot later in the day. A special end to today’s hike.
Atop Peter’s Mountain and walking south, back to Pearisburg, we met a hiker called Geo who informed us that he had scared off the wild goats, as though that was a good thing. He was right, he had scared off the wild goats because we didn’t see any. I was very disappointed, but Felix knew they were there. His ears were up and he was sniffing the air for them, but they stayed hidden. What we did see a little later, was one of those dang white tailed deer that drive Felix to distraction and predictably, that’s exactly what happened. He actually levitated from the ground trying to take off after it. It’s a good thing he only weighs 36 lbs because if he were bigger I would have gone airborne with him.
The shrubs are leafing out quickly now…we even saw a vine climbing one of the old trees that looked like how I have heard poison ivy described. We were very careful to avoid touching it, having had very negative interactions with poison oak in the west. We also saw wild geraniums; I mention these because I could identify them but they were just one flower among many for which I have no names.
We watched the clouds, enormous clouds, come and go all day…I was worried it might rain on us because I neglected to bring a rain jacket, but it didn’t. Instead, we were treated to watching the giant clouds cast giant shadows on the valleys below us as the sun came and went creating an always changing chiaroscuro landscape.
Since we were traveling south against the flow of Northbounders, we saw a number of people that we haven’t seen for a while and also some new hikers we haven’t met before! I had reservations about going today, we could have used the rest but I’m glad we did. It’s good to break the expected routine sometimes…it just means our rest day is delayed.
Back at Angels Rest, we’ve washed our clothes and resupplied the food we need for the next 4 to 5 days. Just need a good night’s sleep before we begin again!

We left Angels Rest after a good breakfast, with Mike, the shuttle driver and Silvertip, who was going to slack pack the same section we walked yesterday. We were on the trail by 8 a.m. but in spite of the fairly easy grade, the first part of the day was very slow going. The trail was full of old rocks to negotiate. 
It was also cooler than yesterday even with less clouds and more sun, but this made the hiking more comfortable overall. We went out to look at some view points (Wind Rock and Kelly Knob) but noticed that the views are closing in as the trees fill out their leaves more every day.
At the end of the day we were treated to some lovely tree-sized azaleas in pink bloom. We only met 3 southbound section hikers all day. But in the shelter, we saw Purp again and Farmer Phil and his dog, Diesel. We camped behind the shelter, food in the tent with the dog because we arrived too late to hang it. Kerry thinks so far on the AT hanging food is mostly ceremonial as there are rarely good branches from which to hang food, and most of the food hanging he has observed would definitely not stop a Yosemite bear…but maybe East Coast bears are less aggressive?
I forgot to mention that we crossed into West Virginia yesterday, very briefly. There were no signs so I’m not sure if we were there again today. That makes 5 states now!

My father would have been 89 today. He died at 34, so he has been gone more than half my life, but I like to think about him on his birthday. I think he would have enjoyed this journey.
We crossed the Eastern Continental Divide today. I didn’t know there was one! Waters on the east side goes to the Atlantic Ocean 405 miles away and rivers on the west side go to the Gulf of Mexico, more than 1000 miles away.
We were feeling a bit tired and thinking about stopping early when we came upon TRAIL MAGIC at VA Route 621. It was 4:30 or so and Ed and his wife Moving Moo/Sue from Blacksburg, were serving up hot dogs and real French fries (he had a contraption strapped to a tree to slice real potatoes that he deep fried right in front of us and unbelievably, he also had malt vinegar for the fries!). Everything was delicious, served with… coke, mandarins, apples and cookies. Even Felix had a hot dog, in spite of his continued bad behavior toward Diesel, who was there with Farmer Phil.
We sat and chatted with Ed and Sue for about an hour. Sue is section hiking the PCT, so we told them to look us up next time they come to California, maybe we could help in the area of Sonora Pass. Full bellies, we thought about doing the additional 5 miles we had planned, but instead opted to walk in a mile to the next campsite and get a good and early night’s sleep.
The bridge across Craig’s Creek was out and the ATC had tied orange tape to an alternate route just a little downstream from the bridge where the water is shallower. Ed and Sue must have spent hours placing stones across the creek so that hikers could cross without getting their feet wet. It was quite a project!
We started the day early enough this morning, and were making good time when we met our first good-sized mountain about 4 miles in. After climbing it and walking along a rocky ridgeline for a few miles, we both felt more tired than usual. 
For the first time, we looked across the valley to a velvety green line of mountains on the other side and realized that we were looking at mountains covered in green trees! It was quite a sight, quite different from the browns and grays of the past weeks. There were dogwoods interspersed among the trees everywhere and wild geraniums afoot! We could hear cows mooing in the valley below, which only heightened the feeling of life returning to Earth.
Farmer Phil and Purp passed as early in the day and we met several people coming Southbound including two older men who warned us of a large rattlesnake on the trail that we did not see. 
As the day wore on the clouds moved in and covered the sky, but Ed told us tonight is not forecast to rain. There may be a little in the next couple of days, but Friday is forecast for 80% chance. That means we will get wet before Daleville, 40 miles ahead.
It’s still light, Kerry has hung the food bag on an almost perfect tree! 
Just thinking, I know T..S. Eliot wrote the Wasteland as an allegory, but for me his words aptly apply to our very real experiences:

Kerry announced he was supposed to get his first social security check today and he can’t wait to find out if he did…that will be Friday, probably, when we get to Daleville. 
We slept pretty well last night and long, which I think we all needed. We were climbing our first mountain before 7 a.m. and found it was steep but gradually so. Our first stop at 3 miles in was at a monument to Audie Murphy, the most decorated American serviceman from World War II. Kerry had never heard of him, but I had. When I first came to the States, my mother and I lived with another woman and her two boys who were younger than me. But I remember they were always watching stories about Audie Murphy in movies, or perhaps they just rewatched the same movie. Anyway, the name stuck in my head, dredged up from more than 50 years ago. Murphy is clearly still well loved/respected. The monument was covered in mementos: medals, messages and artificial flowers. The path leading to it decorated with small flags, with a big American flag and a Texas flag, flying right next to the monument. It was quite a tribute.
At VA 20, more trail magic: someone had placed a crate full of cokes just below the bridge crossing the creek. I might not have seen it but I had taken Felix down to the creek for a drink and there it was a nice treat…helped us up the next mountain!
We made fairly good time before noon, hiking almost 10 miles and passing the 700 mile mark by 12:15. We stopped for an hour for a rest and lunch, and I’m glad we did, because then it was on to Dragon Tooth. It was very rocky and rough going and slowed us considerably. It was also very interesting geologically….I wish I knew more but I could tell a lot happened here at some point in time long ago. The trees, now green, substantially impacted the views but I’m glad we took the little detour to see it. 
An hour later, having clambered down and slid on sheer rock faces (I know I’ve already said this, but I think we may be a tad old for this kind of thing), we saw a sign, helpful to those coming from the other direction, indicating steep rocks ahead….they weren’t exaggerating! We did make it down in one piece, more or less, but very slowly.
Our big surprise of the day was to see our first rhododendrons in bloom, big purple blooms and such a treat! 
We didn’t see a lot of people today but Curious George and his friend Sasquatch passed us tonight. We also saw another potential Santa Claus coming Southbound. It seems like 90% or more of the white men over 50 are sporting long flowing hair and long flowing beards, mostly white. It occurred to me that anyone looking for an authentic Santa could just stand at a Trailhead and hand out business cards (“need a job? Be a Santa!). No more disappointed kids pulling off Santa’s fake beard!

It’s 9:40 p.m. We have just had another great Mexican meal with giant margaritas at Pancho’s in Daleville. After struggling with the the miles the last couple of days, we got up this morning with significant motivation to get to Daleville today: rain predicted for this evening. It arrived right on schedule a little after 5 p.m. Since we didn’t arrive until 7 p.m., we got a little wet. Thankfully, the rain didn’t start in earnest until after we got a room at Super 8 motel (would you believe it’s adjacent the trail?). We are grateful, once again, to be out of the rain. Tomorrow we plan a to rest.
Aside from the long walk, we had a great day! It was warmer than it has been but the gathering clouds kept us comfortable. The required mountains were not too onerous to climb and we had some special treats along the way,
First, on the way, we met Ridge Runner Bill Dawson. The 74 year-old started hiking when he retired. He was counting hikers and he told us he makes the approximately 8 mile round trip to McAfee Knob about three times a week. He also told us he had seen as many as 300 people visit McAfee Knob last Memorial Day weekend!
We were fortunate to visit this iconic Knob, with only a few other folks. They, helpfully, took photos for us and then left, leaving us alone in this special place. I thought this would be the highlight of our day, but I was wrong. Five miles later we walked along Tinker Cliffs, and they were amazing. The white blazes that mark the trail guided us to the very edge of the cliffs that define the edge of a sheer drop to the valley below. It was such a different view from any that we have walked so far. The mountains, densely green now with new spring growth, seem closer across valleys filled with farms and people. We could see, only here, because we were literally at the edge: no trees-bare or green between us.
Beyond Tinker Cliffs, the walk was mostly through the newly leafed out forest, but at the very end, before Daleville we walked up and down a seemingly unending ridge with views to our right of a large river, maybe the White River…I will need to look it up.
Just waiting now for our laundry to be done. Kerry and Felix have already gone to Never Never Land. Time for me to go too.

We stayed at Super 8 last night in a room with a leaky toilet. Then this morning, today’s manager announced that according to Virginia law (???) Felix could not be a service dog because he let out a “woof” when she banged on the door. I won’t even go into all the illegal things she said, suffice it to say, this is not a place I would recommend to anyone. I thought about reporting her to the ADA people but just didn’t feel I had the time to spend on it, which I’m guessing is what she counted on. Leaves me with a negative feeling about this place, in spite of all the very nice people we met.
On a more positive note, Kerry was able to get his shoes replaced, we resupplied our food for the next leg of our journey, we had two good meals, found a nice hostel (BeeCh Hostel), and met two very nice male hikers: Raven, retired military and Jelle (pronounced Yelle) from Holland.
Right now, rain is predicted for Sunday, the day after tomorrow and we don’t have a plan to avoid it so far. We’ll walk tomorrow and see what the day brings.","Daleville

No hurry to get up this morning because Beth and Yeehaw served breakfast at 8. Sometime after 7 a.m., we wandered over to the community room and drank coffee while we visited with the other hikers: Raven, Jelle, Poppins and her standard poodle, Wylie Coyote and a young man from New Zealand, named Burnt. Kerry was especially pleased with his breakfast; he finally got Pancakes! I was happy because Felix has been turning up his nose at kibble, but he ate it this morning and then he ate some left over eggs, so it seems his appetite has returned.
I didn’t think we would go far today because it was after 9:15 when we started but we had good energy to climb the never ending mountains, which seemed not so strenuous for a change.
Shortly after we started walking, we passed a sign which read “1/3 of the way to Maine”…we hadn’t thought about it so it was a nice surprise to start the day!
When we look out into the forest now it’s filled with green. When the sun shines it bounces off the leaves and we see every shade of green imaginable; a bright mosaic in monochrome.
We walked through forest and along high ridges, and once in awhile we could see deep into the valleys on both sides, which seem to have opened up and widened out. The countryside is finally changing, and not just due to the arrival of Spring.
Today, we saw different wildflowers…Kerry has most of the photos. There were tiny pansy-looking flowers and the azaleas are rapidly opening up…they smell divine, reminding me of honeysuckle. We saw more rhododendrons in bloom….they are going to be amazing when they really open up. Rhododendrons, all in shades of purple and azaleas, in shades of pink.
We came to the shelter because there are supposed to be big storms tonight and rain tomorrow; at least we’ll be dry tonight and can suit up for rain tomorrow!
Kerry is happy with his new shoes!

The rain came around 4 this morning….a gentle soaking rain that stopped sometime before 7 a.m. we were glad to be in the shelter and slept later to give the rain a chance to stop. By the time we got on the trail at 8, the sky was beginning to break up and the cloud cover to rise. As we continued along the ridge next the Blue Ridge Parkway, we had occasional views across the valleys. At one place, where the trail crossed the road, we saw big white swirls of clouds in the valley, with Sharp Top and Flat Top mountains rising behind. 
We thought perhaps the rain was over, but it wasn’t. We had two substantial showers during the day, the final one coming up the mountain to this shelter. It looked like the rain was done but those gray clouds keep coming back and we’ve battened down the hatches  on the tent, in anticipation of more rain. I’m hoping that an earlier weather forecast that predicted sun for tomorrow is correct and that we will awake to sunny skies!
Aside from the weather, which was cool and perfect for hiking, the day passed rather uneventfully. The terrain was much the same as yesterday, maybe steeper, but today after that initial view across the valley, the sky lowered and we walked in a cloud so the views disappeared. We saw a lot of blooming azaleas, many different wildflowers including trillium in various shades of pink. Toward the end of the day, Kerry spotted one of those rare orange salamanders we’ve heard about. It was small, maybe 3 “,  but we managed to get a couple of photos.
We’re higher than last night and the wind is blowing so I think it will be colder.

What a day! This is what happens when you don’t make plans. We thought we were going to do one thing and ended up doing something entirely different.
First of all, it rained last night, but only enough to gently patter on the tent and by morning, all was dry. We had a rich pink sunrise, followed by a dance of clouds of white and grey; sun and blue sky that kept us entertained and at times, anxious (about potential rain), all day.
A lot of climbing today. I think it was on the second mountain that we came upon a giant globe comprising hexagons with giant wands sticking out of it. Alone it looked like something out of a science fiction movie, but it was surrounded by a lot of earthbound security and a bunch of cell phone disks on a tower next to it. There was no indication what the globe was, some secret communication or tracking device probably. I only mentioned this because with cell coverage we were able to check the weather, which promised no rain today. That made us feel better at the time, even though in fact, it did rain later.
The sky was a churning swirl of contrasts in grey clouds mixed with a little blue sky and sunlight. At one point, the forest appeared yellow against the iron grey sky. No matter how many forests we walk through, even similar ones, each day seems to bring a new aspect to see and contemplate.
We were planning to hike possibly 18 miles today and push on tomorrow for a re-supply in Lexington the following day. But it was only 4 p.m. when we got to Matt’s Creek where we planned to stop so we pushed on to the James River Trailhead, where Dob, who we met earlier today on the trail was awaiting a ride to Stanimals Hostel. So we shuttled with him, with Spotter driving. Mags who is running the hostel told us she had no more bunks, but we could tent on the lawn, which looked very nice. 
Then the local Episcopal Church came to pick up all the hikers for a pasta dinner they were serving up due to the fact that the only restaurant in town is closed on Monday. Off we went for a filling and tasty meal! And who should I meet there but a fellow retired Scout Executive, Charlie Rogers from Chester County Council! What a small world!
One of the ladies at the church asked me if we could use some dog food, because her dog did not like the food she had bought. I gratefully accepted, because that was on my list to buy at the Dollar Store.
We did some food shopping at the Dollar General Store and when we returned to the hostel it was raining, so Mags invited us to take the double bed in her bedroom (not as kinky as it sounds, and very generous, we thought under the circumstances). Tomorrow, we plan to take a little break and slack pack the next 11 miles so we can rest a little before we push on to Waynesboro and Shenandoah National Park.
I know this is a bit long, but it was truly a serendipitous day….not at all what we had planned!

We had blueberry pancakes for breakfast and then New Knee, Bodhi, Kerry, Felix and I piled into the van with Spotter (and a couple of other hikers he dropped at James River), to drive up to the Punchbowl Overlook for an 11 mile walk back to the James River Trailhead. It was a cool, cloudy and sometimes sunny day and fast walking because once we climbed the 2 miles to the top of Bluff Mountain, it was mostly downhill the rest of the way. It took us about 4 1/2 hours to walk back to the trailhead. The time went quickly because we were busy talking most of the time.  New Knees and Kerry talked and I spoke to Bodhi, an architect from LA who likes to sing musicals while walking.
One thing we didn’t expect to see…near the top of Bluff Mountain a plaque that read, “This is the exact spot little Ottis Cline Powell’s body was found April 5, 1891, after straying from Tower Hill School House Nov 9. A distance of 7 miles. Age 4 years 11 months”
The rest of the day we tried to catch up with stuff, washed our clothes, ate etc. I’m feeling rather tired, some of it comes from being around so many people…it’s noisy after the silence of the woods.

Charlie, the retired Scout Executive that I met Monday evening, drove Bodhi, New Knee (Nu and…corrected spelling!), Kerry, Felix and I back up to Punchbowl Mountain Gap to begin our hike today. That was after blueberry pancakes and coffee. We hiked together briefly and saw them off and on during the day, but I think they stopped earlier than us.
It was very cold today and there were many times I thought it would rain, which it did once in the morning and then in the afternoon we had a tiny bit of snow. The grey clouds are swirling and blowing this evening so I think we might have rain tonight as well. It was so cold, when the wind blew, we kept our warm layer on most of the day.
We walked up and down the required mountains, I never remember how many but more than two or three. In between the climbs and descents, we walked along Brown Mountain Creek and read signs about the community that used to live there. In this land, totally covered in trees, they grew corn, so perhaps they cleared the land, and now that the people have left, the trees have returned. It was very peaceful by the creek. We also walked along high ridges with amazing views of the far mountains and the valleys below. At times, we thought we must be able to see all the way back to Georgia, or perhaps at least North Carolina!
The wildflowers, tiny as they are, cover swaths of the forest floor in colors of pink, violet, white, yellow, blue and sometimes red. Always an accent in the sea of green.
Up high, and farther north as we are, spring feels like it’s following us, always trying to catch up. I can’t believe it’s May 3, and we’re still this cold! The sun kept trying to break through, and a few times we briefly felt its warmth, maybe more tomorrow!
I forgot to mention that yesterday we saw our first Cardinal perched in a tree near the roof of Stanimals Hostel. We hear lots of birds singing during the day and I was thinking about looking in the library for books with recordings of bird songs. They are very distinctive and with a little effort, I think we might be able to figure out some of the birds that we are hearing.
It has started to rain, Kerry has put all the tent flaps down, and now we have to arrange everything so we don’t inadvertently let the water in during the night!

We were up and out on the trail at 6:25 AM and it was again very cold. Kerry lost his thermometer somewhere after Damascus so now we only guess at the temperature, but when we arrived at the next eshelter around 8 a.m., it was cold enough that we could see our breath. We stopped to eat, it was still too cold for eating but we needed food to keep going. This may sound a bit dire, it wasn’t. In fact, it was cold because this enormous cloud covered the sun ominously for several hours and the wind was blowing but the scenery was amazing.
When we got to Spy Rock, we took the .4 mile detour to climb it and enjoy the 360 degree views as recommended by my friend Arthur and Charlie, the retired Scout Executive. All in all we had a pretty leisurely day…we didn’t go any further tonight because there didn’t appear to be any more camping opportunities before the next shelter 6.3 miles ahead.
Today, the forests were all green and the brown dead leaves on the forest floor, still there, have faded to the background. Up higher, the trees are starting to bud out and we are treated to a constantly changing view as we ascend and descend. We walked through our first azalea forest where the giant azaleas are the size of trees, and depending on where we are, we are enjoy clouds of pink flowers as they bloom. I love the smell of them! 
We saw some day hikers and Southbound hikers today as well as Solo, Gonzo and Smiles on the trail, but for the most part, we just enjoyed the changing forest and the occasional sunlight dancing on the ground through the canopy of leaves.

Much warmer this morning, but darker in the canyon under the tree canopy. We got off to a good start but had a hard 2000 foot climb in about 3 miles; some of it was gradual but a lot of it was quite steep. On the way up, we saw clouds of wildflowers: at one point the green ground cover looked almost white it was so full of tiny white flowers. The violets that have been with us since Georgia line a great deal of the trail every day. Trilliums, geraniums and so many other flowers, it’s quite a show right now. I noticed the air smells wonderful even though most of the flowers have no scent that I can smell, communally they must create a miasma of woodland scent around us. That must sound silly, but I think it’s true!
We saw a wild Turkey fly deeper into the woods today and I almost stepped on another snake, a garter snake this time. I hope I don’t run into a rattler! Then when we stopped to camp, I fed and brushed Felix as I usually do, put his fleece on him and he snuck off to bed only to see a deer walk not 5 yards away! Fortunately, I saw it too and since it woke him up, I had time to grab him before the old lizard brain kicked in. He was on high alert for awhile after that, but thankfully, he’s settled down now.
It was a lovely, if tiring day, we especially enjoyed the sunshine which cast gentle light and made soft shadows. It wasn’t too warm and it wasn’t too cold, even when we were climbing the mountains.
As we walked along the ridges, we had wonderful views of a deep valley with mountains in the distance. We asked some local hikers what we were looking at, and they told us it was the Shenandoah Valley. In grade school, Kerry and I both first heard that haunting song that ends:
“O Shenandoah, I long to hear youAway you rolling riverAcross the wide and rolling waterAway, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.”
Even though we’re no where near the Missouri River, we couldn’t help but think about it, looking out on our first view of a place called Shenandoah. It also made me think of my cousin, my uncle and my aunt that I lived with for year in California during the time I heard that song. They are all dead now. And I felt sad.
Yesterday, we met two women day hiking and today we met the same two so we stopped and talked….they are section hiking in day hikes with two cars. Sarah Clayton, 71 and her friend Marybeth. They looked like sisters, but said they’re not. Sarah’s mother was a war bride from England and Sarah just got her UK citizenship. It was fun talking to them. Earlier in the day, we saw Toenail, who we met maybe a week ago, he has family in the area that he has been meeting up with from time to time. I suspect we’ll see him again.
Another deer just walked close by the tent, obviously totally oblivious to Danger Dog near by. We’re going to have to keep a tight rein on the latter come morning or we’ll never get to Waynesboro! (Just for the record, at home we encourage Felix to chase deer out of the garden because they eat our plants and vegetables, so we sort of trained him to behave this way).","Harpers Creek Tent Site

Last night, we were rather rudely awakened by a flashlight shining straight at us in the dark. This has happened before. I understand people come in late and have to shine a light to figure out where they can camp, but once they shine it on your tent, why do they keep shining it there? Are they afraid we might move or something? Sorry about the little rant, but I get grumpy when awakened from a good sleep.
Anyway, it turned out to be Solo who is actually a nice guy…he probably, like most others, didn’t realize the commotion he was causing. We actually ended up in the same shuttle coming into Waynesboro. He went to Stanimals whilst we went to the Quality Inn.
Another idyllic walk this morning, although we did have clouds forming, it was a lovely walk in the woods. No big mountains to climb and good tread to walk on most of the way. The blackberries are going to be prolific here this year; tons of white blooms and food for the birds and the bears. We were also fortunate to see some of our first wild roses, also white and filling the air with their scent. 
It was only 10:30 or so when we arrived at Rockfish Gap, but the much looked-forward-to food truck was not yet in service, so we sat and awaited the shuttle, which arrived from Stanimals with Listener driving. He stopped at the Outfitter for me so I could replace my 864 mile shoes (I got Altra, Olympus 5…great cushion) and then on to the Quality Inn: lunch, food for the walk through Shenandoah in the next week, bathing, laundry and just hanging out, in that order.

"Jo, Kerry & Felix",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/663401,"Hiking day 57, Ending Elevation 2196 feetToday is the second luniversary of our hike (March 7 to May 7). I just thought I should acknowledge that!
We got off to a slow start today. Our ride back to the trail didn’t show up for some reason and we had to scramble. Dubose Egleston, jr. came to our rescue and dropped us off at Rockfish Gap at 9 a.m. just as Nu Ne arrived, so Dubose ferried Nu Ne back to Waynesboro and we went on our way.
The tread was good and the gradient was kind, up and down but not too steeply most of the time. We paralleled the road and from time to time we would cross it to a ridge on the other side. We walked mostly under a green canopy but at one point we walked along a grassy ridge where we saw a rather large collection of microwave dishes and supporting equipment: an odd site in a national park. Another odd thing, we kept seeing signs with park rules on it; one of them was to keep pets leashed. I had been told that dogs are not allowed in any national park but this appears not to be the case in Shenandoah…I will have to look into this. It also appears not to be a rule that we have to stay in shelters, but we are asked to use existing campsites along the way.
We had heavy packs, loaded with food for 5 days and we were feeling every extra ounce, but we were enjoying the scenery. And then at about 2:30 p.m. it started to rain. We covered the top half of us but not the bottom half….a big mistake. I thought the rain would be brief, but it wasn’t brief enough, we both got very wet from the thighs down and to top it off, Felix’s poncho lost one of its straps. During the day, we met a section hiker who was slack packing, by the name of RC. At Sawmill Run overlook, he had parked his truck and offered to take us back to Waynesboro to dry out. We could have gone on, but the prospect of starting dry and getting organized better for the rain was very appealing to me, and that’s what we did. We’re back at the Quality Inn and will return to Sawmill Run  Overlook tomorrow. Perhaps in the morning the view will clear and we will be able to see something!","Rockfish Gap

Dubose Egleston, jr. dropped us at Sawmill Run Overlook at 8:40 a.m and who should be there but RC and Solo, the latter holding Felix’s distinctive red poncho that we left in RC’s truck. It had a fastener that needed fixing and now I can’t find that. It’s supposed to rain most of the day tomorrow and I’m not sure if we can rig up something to keep him dry. At least we got the poncho back..
The sun was shining and we set out dry and comfortable, so the trip back to Waynesboro yesterday was well worth it. It was supposed to rain again today after 7 p.m. it’s almost that now and the sun is still shining with not a cloud in the sky. Kerry tells me the forecast has changed to rain tonight and most of the day tomorrow. So tomorrow maybe a slow day for us, we’ll see.
Today, we had a wonderful walk in the woods. Up and down the ridges, a few times back and forth across Skyline Road, which traverses the length of the park. The tread on the trail, which was lined on either side with grass most of the time, was mostly soft dirt and/or lined with pine needles. Not too many rocks and it was easy to walk on. The air was full of the forest scents from the trees, the shrubs and the wildflowers, a special time of year!
A small brown toad hopped across the path in front of me this morning but the real excitement of the day came later. I was walking along deep in no thought (as usual) when I heard Kerry shriek behind me. I had just walked past (we’re talking inches away!) a good sized coiled sunning/snoozing rattlesnake that I must have woken up. He wasn’t happy because he was rattling his tail rather vigorously in front of or at Kerry. The remarkable thing is that Felix, right behind me, didn’t notice him either. When I looked back at the snake, I couldn’t believe I hadn’t seen him. I really need to wake up when I’m walking!
Later, we saw Curious George again. We haven’t seen him for awhile. Apparently, his friend Sasquatch became very ill in Daleville and had to go home. We also saw Chance, who we met at Woods Hole Hostel. He remembered us. He is using his bike to ferry himself along the trail—he walks back to it for 7 days, then rides up trail and does the same again.
At one point when we came to Skyline Road, the traffic was stopped for construction and as we sat by the side of the road to get a drink of water a man and a woman in a stopped car rolled down their windows to talked to us. I asked them if they knew what time the store closed, and they weren’t sure, but thought maybe 5 p.m. we talked a little longer, then they pulled out a quart of strawberry-kiwi drink and a coke and offered it to us. We gladly accepted. I had inadvertently yogi’d the drinks….I thought Kerry had, but he assured me it was me! The nice man who was waving the traffic on told us people give him things all the time; he took the empties for us and wished us well.
We decided to stay at this park campground tonight, because we were unsure of the weather and there is a store here that we hoped would be open but it is not. It’s nice to sit at a picnic table to eat our dinner anyway.. I forgot to mention that Kerry pulled 15 ticks off Felix on Sunday, so the season of ticks has arrived. We had applied permethrin to our clothing in Daleville but that’s not an option for Felix, so our nightly routine now, besides brushing him, is to go over him carefully for ticks. They don’t seem to bother him too much and he is vaccinated for Lyme disease. We also apply tick medicine on a regular basis.

It was supposed to rain after 6 a.m. so we woke up early in hope that we would be able to pack up before the rain came. As it turned out, the rain started about 9 a.m. and we were well on our way. We learned our lesson from a couple of days ago and set out in rain pants, rain jacket and packas (a sort of poncho jacket that also goes over the pack). Felix was wearing his newly remodeled orange poncho. We all stayed dry enough!
At first, the sky was fairly clear, but clouded quickly and as we walked along the clouds lowered in the sky sufficiently for the mountains to rise out of them like islands in the sky. This view melted away into a fairly thick fog which we walked in most of the day. Undoubtedly we missed some amazing views! When the rain came, it was so dark; it felt like twilight, but on we trudged. I’m pretty sure that the weather affects my mood….I was feeling  rather down and lacking energy most of the day. Kerry checked for a weather update and learned that we would not have more rain and that the skies should start to clear toward evening. He may have said it to cheer me up!
Meanwhile, we walked, in white and eventually came to HighTop Hut a little after 3. It was cold, damp and very foggy and also early so we decided to move on. This was a good decision because after we summited High Top Mountain and started to descend on the other side, the sky and the cloud we were walking in appeared to lift above us and the world returned. Kerry found a tent site mentioned by another hiker on the Farout App and surprisingly we found it. We’re here alone, just the way we like it and 5he sun is shining in anticipation of tomorrow (I hope).
As we walked, I realized that the forest is truly green now. The understory is a lush cacophony in shades of green with splashes of wild flowers in places…today we had clouds of trilliums on High Top Mountain. Felix had some entertainment too, bunnies and deer; he makes almost neighing sounds when he sees them and his tail waves so fast, he looks like he could fly. If it weren’t for Felix, we probably wouldn’t see as much wildlife as we do, so I shouldn’t be too hard on him!
We didn’t see any AT hikers today, I think for the first time! And, we went over mile 900!

So it’s true, the weather definitely affects my mood. We woke up to clear skies and sunshine and I am now certain that sunlight dripping through the trees feels a whole lot better than raindrops dripping from their leaves!
We all slept well and we got a good early start…in fact we arrived here about 2 for a late lunch at the Wayside: hamburgers for Kerry and I, and a hot dog (on bun with mayo-hold the relish) for Felix. Then we ate various other items to help with the calorie deficit!
We had talked about moving on if we arrived early, but we are not in a hurry (we did see 5 other AT hikers on the trail and at lunch), and the prospect of food, a shower, clean clothes and more food seemed like a good plan….so here we are at the lodge in a nice clean room, all cleaned up and ready for a new day!

We realized that sorry as we were to miss yesterday’s views in the fog, they probably weren’t a lot different than the views we had today or any other day for that matter: that is a vast or small valley with more mountains on the other side. It’s amazing to me that we have been walking for 2 months, more than 900 miles through nearly contiguous forest….I wouldn’t have believed it possible to walk through that many trees, if we hadn’t done it! That said, if anyone were thinking about trying a section hike on the AT, up to here, I would say Shenandoah National Park would be a great choice….it’s very easy on the feet and the eyes.
We saw an older couple with a pruning saw, they had just cut an obstructing tree from across the trail. The tree was probably 8” across and they cut it with that little saw. I was impressed. They are volunteers with the Potomac Appalachian Trail Cub that has responsibility for maintaining the trail in this area.
We went to the lodge for another good meal and our first wine since leaving California! Way past hiker midnight and time to sleep!

I didn’t sleep well on a full stomach…Kerry had some trouble too, but we’re not complaining…it was good to have two good meals yesterday and this morning we had another before setting out for yet another walk in the woods, with occasional views through the haze. Later in the day, Kerry described the haze effect as comparable to the views we get in the Sierra Nevada when forest fires proliferate: very close in and dense white/grey out beyond. I wonder if it’s just humidity, but I think there must be pollution mixed in judging by its slight pinkish color.
More fine sunshine today to buoy us along. About 8 miles on, we came to the Skyland lodge with diner. Miraculously, still full from breakfast, we indulged ourselves with frozen drinks from Starbucks, followed by ice cream for me and blackberry cobbler with ice cream for Kerry. I also found a book for Helio (we felt bad that we had missed our grandson’s birthday) about Grandma Gatewood’s trek on the Appalachian Trail. I hope he likes it, at least it might explain what we’re doing. The lady in the Gift Shop will mail it to him tomorrow.
This is how we managed to use up a good chunk of our walking time, but Kerry said this is our 50th Wedding Anniversary walk and if we want to stop for ice cream we should! We enjoyed it too.
From Skyland Lodge on through the next five or so miles North, the air was scented, with what to me smelled almost chemical, but Kerry thought it was just some shrub. Eventually, the smell dissipated, replaced by the wild azaleas that I love.
We stopped high on a ridge about a mile beyond the last shelter we passed (Byrd’s Nest #3 Hut) in an unofficial but gently used tent site so we are, thankfully alone tonight. It’s supposed to rain tomorrow afternoon and we hope to make good progress in the morning. There is another Wayside in 10.7 miles and we will have to stop to see if we can get more dog food. If not, it’ll be hot dogs for Felix.
He is quite a character, with an uncanny ability to hone in on rabbits…we’ve seen quite a few but only because he points them out to us. On the subject of animals, I almost fell on my face today trying to follow a hawk as it flew gracefully through the trees. I also had to pull a tick off my leg, I’m pretty sure I picked up whilst taking a potty break. Kerry on the other hand only had to remove 5 ticks from Felix during his “getting ready for bed” tick removal session. Felix does a pretty good job of removing some of them himself and the tick medicine seems to be helping too.
Almost 8 o’clock and still quite light…another beautiful sunset coming up. Still, hiker midnight and we will have no trouble going to sleep!

Today would have been my stepfather’s birthday, I m not sure which one but he would have been over 90. I always remember it because I ruined his birthday when I was 10 years old when my appendix ruptured and I almost died. I’m quite sure he always remembered that birthday too!
We had a good day, hiked a bit farther than we planned. We wanted to take advantage  of the good weather and get as close to Front Royal today so we wouldn’t have to walk so far in the predicted rain tomorrow. The problem was that we had trouble locating a stealth tent site so we kept walking until we did.
This morning, we were motivated to get to the final Wayside Camp Store and Grill 10.7 miles away in time for lunch, and we did. Kerry and I had hamburgers again and Felix got his hot dog (hold the relish) with mayo. We also bought more dog food since we were  completely out! We bought sandwiches for dinner, and in celebration of our final night in Shenandoah, Kerry bought a beer to share to go with them. We had lots of other stuff too, doing our part to keep the park concessions profitable.
At Thornton Gap, I read a park info-panel that confirmed what I thought: many of the trails were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the early 1930s. The reason I thought this was because some of the rock work on retaining walls is truly amazing. They also did a lot of work on erosion control on the Skyline Road that runs the length of this narrow park.
On those same panels I read about different animals in the park including the Timber Rattlesnake, which maybe what I saw earlier in the week. But today, I almost stepped on another black snake which struck a position to strike and rattled its tail at me. It had a light multi-colored underbelly and I have no idea what it was. Kerry got some great photos so we will have to investigate.
Later, we met another volunteer, Don Terry, from the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club with a bucket of paint re-blazing the trees. Earlier we had seen some greenery painted in neon blue/green; apparently an invasive non-native called, “garlic mustard” that has thrived particularly well this year. The eradication poison was quite strong smelling where freshly sprayed, and thankfully, that gave way fairly quickly to the scent of the heavenly azaleas that proliferate
On the info-panel, I also read that air quality is a problem and concern in the park: on a clear day one used to be able to see 115 miles. Now, one is lucky to see 26 miles distant and 15 is more common. The haze we see does seem to have increased as we have walked further north and got closer to the urban areas of north Virginia and Washington DC.
The only AT hiker we saw today was City Dog  again, who walked by our campsite. He in a hurry because he has to go home to Massachusetts for a few days.
Felix got de-ticked and brushed and is trying to sleep with us rustling all around him. Last night he had some active dreams, probably chasing those white-tailed animals that drive him so crazy. In his sleep he was making happy doggy yipping sounds. Hopefully tonight he’ll have more mellow dreams! Time to join him.","Tent site at mile 942.3

We planned a short walk into Front Royal. David from the Stumble Inn explained that the name Front Royal came from passwords used posted sentries during the American Revolution. The sentries would say, “front” and the correct answer was, “Royal”. I looked it up, there are other theories too, but I like this one.
We hadn’t planned to go to Front Royal, but with a forecast for heavy rain we decided it was a good alternative to walking in it. David picked us up at the trailhead and brought us to the Inn. We spent hours on laundry, showers and catching up on personal items…a partial rest day. Tomorrow we head on to Bears Den, where we meet up with my CDTC friend, Don in two days.
We got up at 5, to avoid the rain that didn’t come until we arrived at the road to Front Royal. I began to think the rain wouldn’t come at all, but it did as promised this afternoon and we were happy to have a rest day.
I spend a lot of time on the trail just being in the moment and I think about a lot of things I’d like to remember later, but I rarely do. Yesterday, I was looking at the understory and I was thinking about fairies (little) in their world where the understory is their forest and their world goes on in the diminutive. It makes me think of Christina Rossetti’s Goblin Market:
“Down the glen tramp little men.One hauls a basket, One bears a plate, One lugs a golden dish Of many pounds weight. How fair the vine must grow Whose grapes are so luscious; How warm the wind must blow Through those fruit bushes.” “No,” said Lizzie, “No, no, no; Their offers should not charm us, Their evil gifts would harm us.” “
Anyone who knows this poem will wonder why I would include a quote from it. I always loved it even though it was rather sad, and what can I say but it’s a poem about two sisters  and it reminds me of my mother and my aunt and all the stories they told me as a child. These are the things my mind wanders to when left to roam the woods for a while.The wild roses were abundant today and so fragrant!
We’re sitting in the hostel and I am drinking tea. Wedge, a single man is here, as well as Ripley and Red Beard whom we first met at Angels Rest. Just the five of us. It’s very pleasant and unlike some of the chaos we’ve encountered in other places.

We got off to a later start, as we had to be shuttled back to the trailhead by Stumble. David had the day off and left to go to a baseball game (Nationals vs Mets). But the trail was very kind today with mostly good tread and gradient changes that were not too onerous. And we had two encounters with trail magic! The first near the beginning of our walk, when we ran into a trail runner named Laurie who told us that she and her husband, an AT hiker called Wye Not, had a cabin close to the trail and kept a cooler stocked with sodas and snacks. We had cold Cokes there. After lunch, we ran into an AT hiker named Trudge, together with her mother, Michelle and friend, Lyric who runs a hostel nearby. They were serving hot dogs and hamburgers and all kinds of goodies. So The three of us gratefully accepted a hot dog, a mandarin orange, and Kerry and I had another coke. A great day for trail magic!
We ran into all kinds of interesting people including “co-ed” Scout Troop 1 out of Washington DC on their first overnight backpacking trip. Their Scoutmaster, Rob Schafer, let me take their photo to post on Facebook for the BSA retiree group. Later, we met a couple with a large German Shepherd out on a day hike for a picnic. Their names were Pamela and Panos and  seemed very nice. We saw lots of couples and even some bird watchers from whom I would love to learn a thing or two!
The trees were very tall here at these lower elevations and Kerry found a tulip flower that had fallen from a Tulip Poplar tree. It was perfect and he gave it to me for Mother’s Day. It was a lovely gift! You cannot see these flowers from the ground; the trees are too tall and the light green petals are camouflaged in the trees’ leaves. He took a photo of me holding my “gift” and then we returned it to the forest perhaps for someone else to find.
I feel a little silly about my ramblings on fairies yesterday, but in these lovely woods it’s very easy to imagine them all around us. The sunlight filters through the tree canopy and puddles on the ground in a magical way, transporting us to other realms. Maybe I’ve been out here too long but I’m enjoying myself. :-)

We awoke to gray skies and a beautiful rosy dawn. We planned to meet my friend Don at Bears  Den Rocks so we were excited to see him and meet his family. The walking was much the same as it has been except when we got to the “roller coaster” about 8 miles in. The roller coaster is a series of climbs and descents between 4 and 5 hundred feet, about seven of them over the next 8 miles. It made for some intense walking.
Along the way, we saw Rat God again. We first met him at Saw Mill Run Overlook in the rain. We met a father and son, section hiking to Harpers Ferry. The dad, Q, is a computer science teacher and the son’s name was Joe, as in Joseph. We had a fun chat with them over lunch by a stream.
We smelled lapsang souchong in the air today and the green lettuce smell (or maybe “salad” is a better descriptor?) that seems so ubiquitous.
Our friend, Don has a very full house right now: his daughter, son in law and grandson are staying with them while their house is being built, But he picked us up at the trailhead and took us to the local brewery for beer, followed by ice cream at the Bluemont General Store. After that he took us home with him to join his family for dinner. Tomorrow, he will slack pack us to Harpers Ferry.

Sleeping on a thick pad of grass in Don’s meadow was truly wonderful…soft and padded! The only disadvantage to sleeping in a meadow is that it tends to be very damp, and we awoke this morning to wet sleeping bags and a wet tent, inside and out. I put the sleeping bags in the dryer for 20 minutes and wiped down the tent walls with a towel and once the sun had risen above the horizon for an hour or two, the tent dried out.
Amy made us a wonderful breakfast with scrambled eggs from her own chickens. Everything was delicious and filling. Don got us to the trailhead by 8 a.m. and we were off. It turned out the “roller coaster” we were on yesterday continued on for another 4 miles.  When we came to the end of it, the tread improved and the ups and downs became less steep. 
My friend Arthur has been such a wealth of information on the history of the trail and he did a lot of work in this section: he wrote to me, “For 11 years I was the trail overseer (maintainer) for the AT section from the crest of Loudon Heights into Harpers Ferry. Dave Richie, the NPS superintendent for the Appalachian National Scenic Trail preceded me as overseer and Don Owen (note from me, this is the same Don who hosted Kerry and I last night) succeeded me as overseer. So when you begin your descent from Loudon Heights down to the Shenandoah River you'll be walking ""our"" trail! Prior to 1987 the AT continued along the crest of Loudon Heights directly to the US340 bridge across the Potomac River. The trail it now follows was previously the Loudon Heights Trail within the Harpers Ferry National Historical Park. On January 28, 1986, A HFNHP park ranger, an ATC trails person, and I scouted Loudon Heights for the potential relocation of the AT for direct access to Harpers Ferry and the ATC headquarters. It's easy for me to remember the exact date because when we returned to Harpers Ferry clips of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster were showing on the restaurant TV. Ultimately, the decision was made to utilize the existing Loudon Heights Trail, for which I was the overseer. So later that spring, after approval was granted,  I painted the AT white blazes over the Loudon Heights Tail blue blazes and literally brought the Appalachian Trail into Harpers Ferry!”
Now I’ve walked that section, I can understand why the change was made. There’s a lot of history in Harpers Ferry and the change in route allows us to walk over both the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers.
The woods today were less dense than they have been, so we could see further into the understory. And those blooming ”blackberries” kerry and I have been seeing so much of were all over the place today. But now we are beginning to think they may be different from the berries we see in the west. Dubose, our Waynesboro shuttle driver, called them raspberries, which seemed unlikely, but now we are not so sure.
Don had offered to drive our packs to Harpers Ferry, and this allowed us to hike the 20 miles without backpacks for a more easy going day. I used my new hands-free leash with bungee cord on Felix and it worked great. I think we were both more comfortable. We ate real sandwiches for lunch at Don’s house were delicious, so no trail food today; it was great.
At Harpers Ferry, we checked in to Towns Inn and then we had fish and chips at the Rabbit Hole restaurant across the street, after a nice shower and we will have clean clothes for tomorrow…2 days in a row.

We woke up early but didn’t begin walking until 7:30 a.m. We were holding out for coffee at the local coffee shop, but it showed no signs of opening, probably because in a tourist town everyone sleeps late! 
In spite of our disappointment, we started our walk under sunny skies on a 4 mile walk along the Potomac River to our right with the old C&O canals and their complex lock system to our left. The “path” was wide enough for the two of us to walk side by side and for bicycle traffic to pass easily. This was an unexpected gift. We had anticipated climbing a mountain immediately, but instead, we had a pleasant leisurely morning walk. In fact, even the hike up South Mountain was not as steep as I thought it would be and most of the tread, a bit rocky in places, was good.
It’s interesting the different smells that catch ones attention. More of the forest lettuce/salad smells today but also a very strong smell like a sewer. I know it was just something growing in the area but it was disconcerting never-the-less. At Gathland State Park, Generic Hiker was trail magicking sodas and chips. Kerry and I both indulged in a coke and chips and gave Felix a long drink of water. There is a large monument to war correspondents here. Kerry took photos of the descriptive panels, but a prominent feature is a list of 157 journalists who saw and described in words or art the events of the tour years of the civil war.
At this point we were only 7.4 miles out from our rendezvous with Jason, son of one of my high school friends, Linda. He would be at Turners Gap near Boonsboro to take us off the trail for a few days for a much needed rest.
We walked uphill, I hesitate to say up-mountain because it just didn’t seem that far, one more time and then it was very easy going all the way to Turners Gap. We saw a lot of civil war info-panels on the way….there is so much history here of which I am woefully ignorant having grown up mostly in England.
We arrived at Turners Gap a little after 4 p.m. and Jason took us to his parents home in Oakland, Maryland. Sometime this morning we left West Virginia, which we had entered just before Harpers Ferry, and started our short walk through Maryland.

We are almost half way to Maine and decided now would be a good time to rest up before continuing on. It’s supposed to rain tomorrow so we won’t move on until Sunday. I’m a bit anxious about going onto Pennsylvania, which everyone not-so-affectionately calls Rocksylvania. We are told that the Northern end of the trail is more difficult. Whether or not that’s the case, it will certainly be different!
We are trying to better gauge our food situation because it is the heaviest thing we carry and it seems there are plenty of opportunities in the next few days to get more food. We’ll probably end up carrying 4 days worth because that seems to be how the packages we buy work out. 
I just weighed Felix and he weighs 37.4 lbs. I think that’s what he weighed when we started, though no doubt he has more muscle strength now. That’s amazing because even though I’ve almost tripled what I offer him to eat daily, sometimes he just doesn’t eat it. This just confirms my belief that he knows what he needs and to trust him to eat what he needs.
Kerry and I have still not figured out what we need but I feel like we’re getting better at it. We’re fortunate to be able to eat full meals when we go into towns every few days. That helps, but it eating out all the time gets a bit tiresome and adds up on the expense side.
For now, we’re trying to relax and stay off our feet. We even took a nap today. Jason took us to see Swallowtail Falls on the Youghiogheny River where he likes to kayak. It was a short walk to a lovely stretch of fast moving water.

I didn’t sleep so well last night, probably some anxiety about resuming our journey.
We took care of some final food shopping, repairs and cleaning the bottom of the tent. This afternoon, as predicted, it poured rain and we were quite happy to be on the inside looking out at it.
My high school friend, Linda, with whom we are staying, had a recent serious illness that she is still recovering from and I’m sorry we didn’t have more time to visit, but I am happy for the time we’ve had. Hopefully, we can reconnect again before too much more time goes by. Linda and her family played an important part in my graduation from high school. I had a very difficult family situation and they took me in for 6 weeks so I could finish high school and go on to college. Had it not been for their kindness my life might have taken a very different turn.
Thinking about it, it seems appropriate that she would be responsible for giving us a chance to catch our breath before returning to the trail.

We said our rather wistful goodbyes to Linda with promises to reconnect sooner than later, then her husband, Mark drove us for 2 1/2 hours back to Turners Gap. Mark told Kerry to call him if we ran into any problems…it was very kind of him to offer this. Felix was so excited he almost jumped into my arms when Kerry asked him if he wanted to go for a hike. 
I wanted to take this opportunity to thank people who have commented or made suggestions in my guestbook (or by email). It makes us feel like we have an extended family out there looking out or us!
It was 10 a.m. before we set off and we had a lot to see today. The sun was shining through the tree canopy and puddling on the ground unpredictably. There was a nice cool breeze in the morning so it was an easy start to our hiking day.
A couple of miles in we came to the first monument to George Washington erected by the people of Boonsboro in 1827. I didn’t know it existed but obviously the locals do, there were quite a few people out for a Sunday walk, including Troop 466 out of Hanover, Maryland and Troop & Pack 457 sponsored by St. Patrick’s Church out of Rockland, Maryland.
Leading to the monument were snippets of Washington’s biography and history of the time. It was very interesting. After visiting the monument, we stopped at Annapolis Rock(s) about 4 miles further on…there were lovely views of the immense valley in front of it. From there we continued on mostly rocky but gentle hill terrain to this campsite. We didn’t get far today, but we got to see quite a lot. Not a lot of campsites so we thought it best to stop when we found one. 
We are fairly close to a road here and I am hoping the infrequent traffic will die down with the end of the weekend so we can sleep.

Today I realized I haven’t seen any violets since Virginia…before Harpers Ferry. We saw them daily since a few days or so after we started, a constant in the passing miles and now they’re gone. I’ve felt the spring following us north until now. While we took our 3 day break, it hurried past us and now it’s somewhere ahead. I could be wrong and I know the weather can change but I’m pretty confident that we are well into spring. The rhododendrons are gone too and the azaleas are fast losing their blooms. We’ve been seeing Laurel bushes in bloom: they don’t smell but they put on a show stopping spread of full white flowers.
We’re seeing different wildflowers….mostly phlox in many different shades from white to purple…tall and lovely and each with a unique scent. And the understory in the forest is replete with young ferns.
This morning the sun was a bright orange orb shining through the haze at the horizon and the light came through the trees like a Maxfield Parrish painting, making us feel like we were in another world. We get up early and when we walk through the magical forest, me in front, little strings of webs catch on my face….I imagine fairies, little people trying to tie me down like Gulliver, but I’m too fast for them!
About midday, we crossed the Mason Dixon line, taking us out of Maryland and into Pennsylvania, our seventh state! 
The ground has been turning rockier for some time but I really can’t say it’s more so now that we’re in Pennsylvania….I think we haven’t come to the infamous part yet! More to come on this subject. Speaking of rocks, we walked through about a mile of large rocks in the trail that had extensive graffiti on them. One said, “let it be!”… I couldn’t help but wonder if the writer of this epithet understood how ironic it was for him/her to deface the environment in this way. It made me angry.
Good news! We haven’t found any more ticks on Felix, so the medicine must be working. We continue to check him over nightly, just in case. He seems quite happy to be back on the trail, his whole being engaged in looking, smelling and discovering anything interesting to him (in other words, anything that moves!). I did however find one on me a bit later!
The birds are singing a lot now, all day long. No doubt they will sing us all to sleep!

We climbed a mile straight up to Chimney Rock, which had been an option to camp at last night, and there were good sites there. Instead, we detoured there this morning for the view across the valley. Gone is the deep wide Shenandoah Valley…we’re back to mountains (now completely green) folded against each other as far as we can see, which isn’t very far due to the humidity in the air creating a fairly thick haze. Or at least that’s what I think. A great view nonetheless.
The trail was comparatively level with intermittent ups and downs and intermittent rocks, but for the most part not difficult. And that is exactly how it has been described to me. One interesting incident, this morning we ran into an old guy, dressed in camo and carrying a shotgun, he said he was hunting wild turkeys. I was mildly concerned to be in the same general space, but we moved on and he didn’t shoot us by accident or otherwise.
We were disappointed that the barbecue place near Caledonia State Park was not open until the day after tomorrow and walked on. In the park, we met 3 men about our age section hiking. Their names were: RUOK, Opa and Rick, the Wingman. We had fun talking to them. RUOK was hiking and shuttling them and we ran into RUOK at the shelter tonight. Also at the shelter were Raven, who we met at the hostel in Daleville; Sandman, the Englishman we met at Stanimals in Glasgow and Dakota who started in Harpers Ferry and plans to flip back from Katahdin.
The mountain Laurel is full of buds everywhere: Kerry says they look like fireworks ready to explode into light, and they do. Sometimes we come across a bush already “exploded”…they are amazing, but it’s too bad they don’t smell.
Tomorrow, we’re hoping to find one of these little stores open that we keep reading about, so we can get some ice cream. No beer apparently, in this part of Pennsylvania… we can live with that, I’m sure they have other treats. Speaking of which, someone did leave some snacks at Swamp Road, that was very nice.
According to the latest information I have, the Appalachian Trail is now 2,198 Miles long, so tomorrow at about mile 1099, we should reach the halfway point of our journey. I don’t think it will be marked. At least we’ll go over mile 1100!

No sooner had we opened our eyes than a bird started a grand clatter. Kerry calls it, “the alarm bird.” Last night, after I had already gone to sleep, he did the same thing just before the light faded into night. Woke me up and it took me a good hour to return to sleep!

We certainly spent a lot on lunch, ice cream and assorted drinks. Sated, we walked another eight miles to the Green MountIn Grocery Store and spent some more, as planned!
The eating, drinking (no beer!), and hanging out bracketed our day, but the hiking was fun and easy in between. The mountain laurels were a day closer to busting out and phlox were everywhere in places. A local lady told me the violets disappear when it gets warm…that may be so but I don’t even see their leaves anymore.
We are here on a hillside out of Dickinson Township (i don’t think 915 feet qualifies as a mountain), alone again the way we like it. It was 80 degrees today and uncomfortably humid. It’s supposed to be cooler tomorrow, which would be good since we will be moving closer to the lowest part of the trail in the Cumberland Valley.

It rained a little bit last night, not so much that we really noticed it. I am happy that we don’t have to walk in the rain but the local people we have talked to are increasingly concerned about the lack rain. It’s been an uncharacteristically dry May.
Our plan for today was similar to yesterday…walk to Boiling Springs for lunch, then on to Carlisle for dinner (and shower, clean clothes and bed). And that is what we did. We each had grilled vegetable salads for lunch, then walked into Carlisle for a room at the Quality Inn and dinner at the local diner. We’re too far away from any stores for resupply so we plan to do that when we walk into Duncannon tomorrow.
As we approached Boiling Springs, we got what I think was to be our first views of Cumberland Valley. For the rest of the day, we seemed to walk sometimes in the woods and sometimes beside/across farmland…it was quite different from anything (including the farms in Virginia) we have seen so far.
The trail continued on a mostly gentle grade and after Boiling Springs, the trail was basically level, in fact, it reminded me of walking in the woods behind my cousin Wendy’s house in England. Very easy and relaxing, a walk in the woods! The Mountain Laurel continues to break into bloom and the smell of wild roses was with us most of the day. Toward the end of the day, we came across our first honeysuckle, it also smelled wonderful.
I’m enjoying the easy hiking days. We both must have rested better than we thought while staying with Linda and Mark even though it didn’t feel so at the time. This part of Pennsylvania seems more rural than Virginia. I don’t think it is but it feels that way. The woods seem more open and Felix thinks so too. All day, he is on high alert for birds and critters, which I have no doubt he would happily chase if he could. The new leash is working well, giving Felix a little more freedom and time for “sniffage.”

While I’m walking, so many things go through my head that I want to remember and then by the end of the day, they fly out of it and I can’t remember anything!
I was trying to understand what feels so different about Pennsylvania so far and what it comes down to is that it feels a little like the hike Kerry and made across the North of England: we were never far from a town where we could get food and the farm fields were all growing something or full of grazing animals. Everything is so civilized: we’ve walked through some farmlands and some grasslands and they all have about a 6 foot corridor mowed through them with the grass on each side sometimes as high as 3 feet. I’m sure that grass is full of ticks so I am grateful to whomever is responsible for ensuring this is done.
I’ve learned not to make assumptions about the path ahead without checking….today, against my expectation of another flat day, we climbed 2 pretty steep mountains! Aside from that the woods were lovely, and after we  crossed the Conodoguinet Creek, they were filled intermittently with clouds of Phlox in the understory. They scented the air, and when they disappeared for awhile it was all wild roses again. When we came out of the woods, even the grasslands were full of purple vetch, so much of it that the fields looked purple. It was all very intense to look at.
We noticed that the ground is getting rockier, but not impossible to walk on, we just need to watch our feet! We had a steep descent into Duncannon which I had not expected. We arrived here about 4:30 and decided to stay at the Assembly of God Hostel. We met the minister, Dennis Campbell, who seems very nice. Then we shuttled with Wheezy Pee to the Dollar General Store to purchase our resupply. I had already bought Felix some kibble because he was completely out and I was afraid we wouldn’t find a store open to buy some. 
After that Kerry, Felix and I went for pizza…can you believe, no beer? I must sound like a lush, but really, pizza without beer? I’ve never heard of such thing. Fortunately, after the pizza, we repaired to the hotel with bar across the street, to rectify the situation…Kerry finally got his beer.
This is a quaint little town, like all the the small Pennsylvania towns we’ve passed through so far, with pretty houses and old buildings and we can’t help but notice the large number of churches which seems disproportionately high compared to the number of people. I probably have a lot more to say, but Kerry is snoring beside me and I have an early day tomorrow, so time to join him!","Carlisle

Wheezy Pee suggested that we slack pack today and Kerry, especially, thought it was a great idea. As it turned out, it was a great idea. There was some rock climbing yesterday and more today toward the end of the hike: rock clambering, I’d call it. It was good to do it without a pack. 
We hiked from Clark’s Valley Road back (south) to Duncannon: this started with a fairly steep climb to a ridge, where we hiked most of the day before descending back down to the Susquehanna River, which we crossed just before re-entering Duncannon.
We had some trail magic at Peter’s Mountain Road. Twister and Hobbly Girl (Pat) we’re handing out homemade banana bread, snacks, fruit and drinks. They were very sweet. They volunteeer with the Susquehanna Appalachian Trail Club. Robert, the German and his friend,  Max were there, as well as Dob, who we ran into slack packing with Chowder yesterday. Chowder is taking a couple of days off to reconnect with his wife.
This is my last entry for a few days as we will be off in the wilds of Pennsylvania tomorrow.  I think I’m going through a bit of a mid-hike retrospective. This is the furthest we’ve hiked in one go and together, Kerry and I. We’re enjoying ourselves but it’s hard physically on both of us. Eating enough is a very real problem…the amount of food we need to maintain our weight is just more than we can take in and we’re beginning to look like a couple of refugees. Felix, on the other hand, young enough at 5 years old, is thriving…he just seems to have more energy and strength with each day.
And then there is the mental thing. To be honest, I’m not sure where I am with that. We get up every day and walk enthusiastically all day long, taking in the sights, meeting new people. Then we go to bed and do it again. I feel privileged and lucky to have the health and energy to do this and sometimes I worry about a time when I cannot. Some random thoughts after almost 3 months on the trail. I wonder how I will feel 3 months from now","Duncannon

Jacob, Wheezy Pee’s husband, picked us up at 7, but it was close to 8 when we got on the trail. I was surprised that we came this far with the late start. We had a couple of climbs, but for the most part we walked along a ridge most of the day. We had our left over pizza for lunch and that got us going for the rest of the day.
Kerry reminded me that whilst we were doing our laundry yesterday, we walked into a new microbrewery and had a beer. It’s a father and son operation, Cliff and Michael Lindgren, with son, Michael as the beer maker. They bought an old bank building and by this October they expect to be serving food. We had a beer called, “Handy Little Fellow”, it was really good. Cliff gave Kerry a quarter and told him to put some music on the jukebox. The first song he chose was Blue Bayou, one of my favorites, which I thought was very sweet (that he would think of me). It was followed by The Rolling Stones oldie, I Can’t Get No Satisfaction, one of his favorites. We had a good time talking to pere et fils, and they even gave us a tour of the new brewery.
I also neglected to mention that the whole town was decorated with photos of their veterans from all the wars, living and dead for Memorial Day. I thought that was a great way to remember those who have died and honor the living.
Duncannon is almost 40 miles behind us now and tomorrow we will roll over the 1200 mile marker as we move north through Pennsylvania. It was warm again today and we walked through the densest rhododendron tunnel that we have seen. No blooms on the Rhodies and I’m  not sure if it’s because they’ve come and gone or it’s too early yet for this year. I hope the latter because I’m not quite ready for spring to be gone. I’ve also noticed in the last few days some of the first green plants to come up in Georgia, I call them umbrella plants because that’s what they look like, are getting yellow spots and wilting at the edges, so they will be a memory before too long. Time passes quickly.
Tonight as we were settling in at our tent site, Slipper, who was at the hostel with us last night came walking up the path. She had planned to take a zero day but decided to leave because one of the men at the hostel was giving her bad feeling. She was dropped off at the last road we crossed, so she didn’t come far. It was nice to see her again. She’s a retired paramedic now living in Northern Virginia.
The light is failing, so I will get to sleep at a reasonable time tonight after two late nights in Duncannon.","Clark’s Valley Road (325)

We awoke to cloudy skies. I thought it was going to rain, but we had blue skies by 9 a.m. We just keep walking through the woods, one foot in front of the other and the brown trunks of the trees appear out of the green understory, lots of lovely ferns lately. The tree trunks stark in their browness, stretch up toward the matching green canopy above. Beyond that is the blue, blue sky and sunlight puddling through the leaves creating a lovely mosaic on the ground for us to walk on. It’s been pretty much the same every day since the weather got better. It makes our days very soothing and peaceful.
About mid morning at PA Route 645, we had some trail magic from Jim, a trucker who lives in Lancaster. He plied us with Pepsies, fruit and honey buns and told us that Eastern Rat Snakes look a lot like the Eastern Racers but are bigger. I think we saw two of the former today and Kerry saw another that he thinks is a different kind of garter snake. Jim also told us that the Rat Snakes imitate rattle snakes, by rattling their tails and looking like they are going to strike, which is exactly what the one we saw in Shenandoah did to us.
Further on we came to the 501 Shelter,  near which my friend Arthur’s friend, Ken fell on the rocks and had a concussion causing him to leave the trail for a couple of weeks. Needless to say, Kerry and I were very careful both approaching and leaving the area. We did walk on a lot of rocky ground today, but it was intermittent with some pretty good tread in between. The rocks slowed us down and they’re tiring to negotiate. Jim told us the further north we go the more difficult it will get, I guess we’ll know when we get there.
We had to fill up on water twice today, an indication of the increasing temperatures I think. Also, we gave a man named Cowboy a half liter of water because he had none. He was traveling with a one liter bottle and no filter. He was a youngish man and he stumbled in to our campsite last night exhausted. He seemed a bit naive and isn’t going anywhere in particular. Kerry wondered if he was disaffected from one of Pennsylvania’s religious communities.  He told us he was from Dauphin County. He was complaining of stomach problems, possibly from drinking untreated water. We left him with the clean water and encouraged him to carry 2 liters of water and a filter. The night before Cowboy told us he had gone to England and the locals had shared their concerns about “all the immigrants over-running the country.” Kerry had listened and then commented that people all over the world just want to improve their lives and those of their children, so they tend to travel to places where they think they will have better lives. He didn’t think anything of it but the next morning Slipper, who had heard the conversation, came over to us and thanked him for saying it. She said, “you’re not Clueless, your name should be Aristotle!” 
This afternoon, as we were walking north of the 501 shelter we encountered a group of women wearing old fashioned dresses and scarves around their hair. Then we saw several more and later in the day we saw some boys and young men in straw hats, their pants held up with suspenders. Kerry and I speculated they might be Amish, so I asked one of the boys as we passed and he confirmed that they were. They were carrying no water or anything for that matter and we wondered where they came from and how they would get home.
We’ve been listening to lots of different birds and Kerry has been listening to them on the Merlin App (also suggested by my friend, Jane) in an effort to identify them, with limited success at this point. And I mustn’t forget the wild roses; every so often we come across them and are inundated with their amazing smell. Lest I forget, we went over mile 1200 today. Now we are counting down from 1000!
It’s dark now and even the birds have gone quiet.","Campsite at 1186.2

Kerry got his hair cut and his beard trimmed and that’s how we got short stopped at Port Clinton. As soon as he heard there was a barber shop and how good they were to hikers, I knew it would be hard to walk on and we didn’t. Frank, the barber is very nice to hikers, but he also seemed to be a genuinely nice man. When I asked about re-supply, he had one of his customers take us to Walmart and then another customer come and bring us back! Kerry hit off with him right away because he had Led Zeppelin and other classic rock playing over the sound system. Apparently, on Friday nights, he has small live bands play in the shop. He and Kerry talked music for quite awhile and Kerry was pleased with his hair/beard cut.
The first part of the day hiking in from the mountain ridge was eventful too. We walked through a large burn area….the tall trees seemed relatively undamaged but the young trees  of the understory were destroyed…from a distance it looked like a low forest of red sticks. We saw some burn areas yesterday also, and I’m guessing the fires were fairly recent, the last three years or so.. 
In the open forest, we saw lots of creatures including two deer, which drove Felix to distraction…he actually screams like a coyote, he gets so exited.
The rocks were intermittent again today; we’d walk for a half mile or so in them, followed by good tread. We got fairly good at walking through, developing a rhythm of sorts. I could tell this was so because if we stopped to rest and started to go again, it would take a while to recover the rhythm.
Mid morning we caught up to two men our age: Konza from Kansas and Burge in food management at Virginia Tech who lives near McAfee Knob. They were finishing a 193 section hike at Port Clinton today.
Kerry and I ate lunch at the Auburn Overlook…the view being similar to all the other views we get from the ridges, but we never get tired of them…our brief glimpse of the expanse beyond the unending woods.
The climb down to Port Clinton was breathtakingly scarey…about as steep as anywhere we’ve been so far, but we made it in one piece, I, having fallen once!
We’re sitting in a grassy area in our tent near the Pavilion, where a lot of other hikers are  too, very spread out so not overwhelmed by them. Some are chatting. Dob, whom  we saw a couple of days ago, had caught up with his friends, came over and we chatted with him for a while. He says we have 70 to 80 more miles before the Delaware Gap (yes, I should look it up myself). We probably have enough food to get there with what we bought today... it’s a bit heavy!
The road into town runs near by and threatens to keep us awake tonight but aside from that it’s been another good day. Tomorrow, we plan to leave early as we have a mountain or two to climb and it will be more comfortable in the cool of early morning.","Black Swatera Creek Campsite

It turns out the traffic noise kept up all night, with the occasional train rolling by for good measure, but the background noise just awakened us from time to time but on the whole we slept just fine. Then we got up to a slightly different breakfast: Kerry had left over French fries, banana and Gatorade…I had the same but without the French fries. Felix of course, as usual when we are fully loaded with food and don’t want to carry extra, decided to eat half his usual portion (he finished it for lunch), causing us to carry it for him.
We had a half mile to walk back to the AT, where we followed the trail beside the Skuykill River until we reached the freeway, which we walked under and up the mountain on the other side. It was very steep but not as murderous as coming down into Port Clinton had been. But the sound of traffic followed us for miles up the mountain before dissipating into silence. The smell of wild roses was everywhere today, off and on, sometimes filling the air before we even saw them. 
At lunch time we sat in the shade at the Pinnacle and another retiree walked up to us to chat. He was carrying some impressive looking camera equipment. He said he had been a bankruptcy attorney and he had just been up to photograph birds, Turkey vultures, it so happens. I thought the juxtaposition of these two facts was funny but I held my tongue and smiled. 
Later, we were passed by 2 young men from Massachusetts, Mack and Stick Shift. They work on Stick Shift’s uncle’s farm. Normally I wouldn’t remark on this as we will probably not see them again but we had a brief conversation and they seemed nice.
I have been trying to think how to describe the peacefulness we feel everyday, it’s not just a feeling, it’s with us now most of the time. Then I remembered Wendell Berry’s wonderful poem, “the Peace of Wild Things,” and realized he captures the experience exactly…this is us, now:
“When despair for the world grows in me and I wake in the night at the least sound  in fear of what my life and my children’s lives may be,I go and lie down where the wood drake rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.
I come into the peace of wild things who do not tax their lives with forethought
of grief. I come into the presence of still water. And I feel above me the day-blind stars
waiting with their light. For a time
I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.”","Port Clinton United Church of Christ Pavillion

What a day, and it isn’t even over yet! We got up early and hiked with enthusiasm, we believed to the Wanamaker General Store, which we thought was 7 miles away and close to the trail. It was a warm morning, temperatures projected to be in the low 90s and the thought of a cold coke, ice cream etc had us positively excited. However, when we got to the road junction, we discovered it was actually about 2.5 miles away, off the AT. Very discouraged, we hiked on.
We met Skippy from Australia and Plunger from Utah (a reformed Mormon) and talked with them for awhile. I’m beginning to sound like a broken record, but they were interesting and nice…have been hiking together for a couple of weeks now, and much faster than us.
To probably misquote Mick Jagger, “you don’t always get what you want, but if you try real hard, you sometimes get what you need.” This is something that happens to me regularly, I should make it my theme song. Anyway, it happened today.
We walked 2 miles on to the Thunderhead Lodge at Rte 309 and sat at a picnic table, to rest and get water. Skippy and Plunger were there doing the same. They eventually moved on and we decided to have lunch. I removed Felix’s backpack to give him a rest and stupidly, neglected to reattach his lead. You can probably guess what happened next! That’s right, along came a deer and Felix took off after it. He returned about 1.75 hours later completely winded…I think he spent the entire time trying to catch that thing. We just sat and waited for him in the 90 degree heat. He was so hot, he couldn’t even take in a drink of water. In spite of his bad behavior (my fault again…a dog’s got to do, what a dog’s got to do!), we decided that it would be cruel to make him hike on his condition. Fortunately, the Lookout Hostel .1 mile down Route 309 had a private room available (their only one!), so we repaired there out of the heat.
We were feeling hot and sticky since we hadn’t had a shower since Duncannon so maybe it was good to take a break, get washed up, clean our clothes and eat real food. Felix, nonetheless, is still in the doghouse. Oblivious, all he knows is that he had a good run and now he gets to sleep. But he’s been looking at me with the whites of his eyes showing, a sure sign he’s looking for sympathy, so he knows!
Kerry and I both thought today was Wednesday, but other hikers assured us it was Thursday, which meant the Thunderhead Lodge would be open for dinner (it’s closed Wednesday)…written up by other hikers for good food and the only place within walking distance. We had written it off but now we were able to have a good meal as well. 
Thus, we didn’t make much mileage today, but we’re retired and really, it all turned out for the best.
And before I forget, we had a lot more rocks today!","Tentsite at mile 1237.5

We left the hostel at 6:30 a.m. and headed north across Route 309. I was beginning to think we might have an easier day, when we began the climb. In fairly short order, we found ourselves clambering on the Knife Edge. We had heard about it but thought it was further away. It was just as difficult as we were told it would be, very slow going and lots of potential for catastrophic falls. In spite of Felix’s propensity for taking off, I had to cut him loose on the rocks. It was impossible to safely cross them with him tied to me. If I slipped, I’d take him with me and if he missed a jump, he would have pulled me down. Fortunately, he had to focus on the crossing so that kept him too busy to be chasing things. This adventure just confirmed our decision not to go on yesterday….this would not have been fun with us all tired and in the heat of the day. Instead, we were fresh and a nice breeze was blowing.
After the Knife Edge, we came upon a known water cache, which we took advantage of, and unexpectedly a little trail magic too. Some electrolyte drinks, which made all the difference for what came next.
I thought the Knife Edge was going to be the main event today but it wasn’t. People told us the rocks would get more difficult, but I missed the part about non-technical rock climbing, which was what we did after we crossed the bridge over the Lehigh River. I have since been told this was Lehigh Gap. Someone suggested we take the alternate Winter Trail as the climb up to the ridge was challenging …again, no mention of actual climbing, as is in finding hand holds and toe holds and keeping your balance with a hefty pack on your back. If the Knife Edge was challenging and even scary in places, this section of the trail was downright death defying: one missed step or slip and that could easily have been the end of us. Again, we cut Felix loose, and that little guy is amazing. There were particularly wide gaps and high jumps he had to make with his pack on and he was a champ, definitely out of the doghouse from yesterday (but still on a short lead!).
Oh, and if the rock climbing wasn’t a sufficient challenge, we had thunder and lightening starting up around us…all we needed was rain on the rocks to make them slippery. Fortunately, the rain held off until we reached the exposed top of the ridge. There it dumped on us so quickly that I didn’t even get my umbrella up in time and once I did, Felix and I just stood under it for the 15 minutes that it poured from all directions. Kerry got his rain gear on but mine was buried and I didn’t want to get my dry stuff wet. As it turned out, I learned my Zpack is not waterproof, but water resistant. A good lesson to learn in summer rain….although it had never leaked water before, so I’m wondering if it’s just wearing out.
Anyway, at this point we were 3 miles out from our final resting place (does that sound ominous?) and I thought that if it didn’t rain again, I had a fair chance of drying out. It did spatter on us but there was a warm wind blowing and my clothes dried more or less. So did Felix, but he was a bit damp so he gets to sleep in the vestibule at least for awhile.
It wasn’t supposed to rain until tomorrow so we’re not sure if we’ll have some more tonight. We needed the rain and hopefully, it will be cooler tomorrow and the sun will shine again! We’re about two days out from Delaware Gap, and hoping that the worst of the rock clambering is over, but if not, oh well…I’m sure we’ll manage. What a day!

We had a fairly comfortable sleep on our bed of pine needles and Felix, still wet from the rain didn't object to sleeping in the tent vestibule although he did eventually manage to cuddle up to me. We had a little more rain but we stayed dry and all the wet things hanging outside were more or less dry this morning. 
Water is in short supply on the next section of the trail, most of the springs are iffy because it's been a dry season and they are a distance (half a mile or so) from the trail. However, in a couple of miles from our camp spot we passed near Blue Mountain Resort where we understood we could get water. The instructions on how to find it were confusing but find it we did...all closed up. Just as we arrived a truck drove up and a lady got out. It turned out she was there to do flowers for a wedding. She was very kind and filled all our water bottles. This was a big relief and got us all the way to Windy Gap.
Today, we met two couples: Half Pint (she carries a half pint of bourbon) and Dundee from Chicago, and Recon (who we called Postmaster because his ball cap makes him look like one) and Popeye who we met in Wainsboro, VA. We also saw Stick Shift and Mac, joined by Mac's sisters Mountain Man and Trail Mix. We kept passing them all day. I think they're all staying in Wind Gap too, as we are tonight.
We had more rocks today and this was both tiring and slowed us down. We have been told by a number of people that tomorrow maybe the most difficult section because it goes on for many miles. 
We had cloud cover all day today and a few spatters of rain a couple of times. This threw Kerry into a scramble to don his rain gear. I didn’t bother because I knew I’d be too hot and I didn’t think it would last gray long. As it turned out, I was  right. After a couple of hours, we stopped so Kerry could remove his gear. I had a feeling the people from Chicago were laughing at the Californians dressing up for rain!
When we arrived at Windy Gap, Kerry convinced me to walk another (off-trail) mile to Detzi’s Tavern. As it turned out in this case, it was probably a good thing, since we had a tasty meal and we’re now camped under a giant evergreen tree and lying on a bed of pine needles again. I’m becoming quite a connoisseur of sleeping on the ground and I put pine needles up there at the top of the list!","Tent site at 1265.4

We had some excitement last night. When Shiloh, One of Detzi’s managers showed us where we could park our tent, she mentioned that the cats running around lived there and they keep the rodent population down. There were several nice looking cats and we didn’t give it another thought. That is, until 1:15 a.m. when Felix, without making a sound leapt through the tent netting in pursuit, we believe, of some animal. We think it must have been a cat and that he tree’d it as he returned rather sheepishly soon after. Had it been a deer, he would probably still be chasing it! We have traveled at least 2500 miles with that dog in that tent and when we close the net door, he knows it’s time to settle down. The mystery is how he so easily ripped through the tent. We think when he leapt, it was paws first and his claws tore through the net…just like one of those circus animals leaping through paper rings.
My theory as to how this happened is that he couldn’t see the net in the dark but he either heard and possibly smelled the cat close by, could have seen its eyes too. Anyway, I will be trying to fix the tent before we go to sleep and now it seems, we may have to keep him leashed in a the tent as well. Poor dog! I think being on the trail, like us has made him more aware of the natural world, and sensitized him especially to the smells and sounds in it. He doesn’t just live in our universe anymore, he has an entirely different kind of animal world to be curious about. We see it as we walk, he is totally curious and watching everything.
So with all that excitement last night, I had a hard time going back to sleep and I thought I would be tired today but I wasn’t. In the morning, we got up and ready to go, when Joey, one of Detzi’s owners showed up. He’s a triplet, and Detzi’s has been in the family for two generations. He told us that they are in the process of selling the business as they are all in their 60s. He made us coffee and took us to the trailhead in his truck…we had heard how kind he is, and we experienced his kindness first hand.
At the trailhead, we immediately started up on a steep and rocky path and as we reached the ridgeline, we shortly passed Stick Shift, Mac, Mountain Man and Trail Mix hanging out and building a fire. It was a cool morning! 
It wasn’t long before the rocks were more than not and this was the case all the way to Wolf Rocks, 6.8 miles from the trailhead. They weren’t so bad that we were seriously slowed and when we finally reached Wolf Rocks we found them marked strategically along the safest/simplest passage for the most part. As Recon had told us, they were much easier to negotiate than the Knife Edge and Lehigh Gap. After Wolf Rocks, it was smooth sailing all the way to the Delaware Water Gap.
I think this was the best hiking weather we have had so far, and we have had some great days! But today, the sun was shining through the tree canopy and because the ground was mostly in shadow, the sunlight created what I think of as negative shadows, or shadows in reverse. At the same time, a cool, refreshing breeze kept the temperature about perfect…felt like they high 60s to me.
The closer we got to Delaware Water Gap, the more day hikers we saw, in fact, the most we have ever seen, but perhaps it was because school is out for summer and it was a Sunday.
Even though we haven’t come that far today at 15 miles, we thought it was a good place to stop…we need dog food and some other supplies so after 2 milkshakes apiece, and wandering around the quaint old town, Kerry took off for Walmart whilst I did the laundry.
Tomorrow, is another day…we will go over 1300 miles and enter our eighth state: New Jersey!

At the Bakery, where we had our milkshakes, we ran into Stealth and Sparks again, with Stealth’s friend, George, who is visiting for a couple of weeks from Germany and we have not met him before. Sparks’ sister, Mouse is off the trail for an injury, but plans to return. We met them a long time ago and haven’t seen them since. It’s funny how people come and go!","Detzi’s Tavern at Windy Gap

We slept pretty well, no cats or wild animals to worry about except our own (Felix), who also slept like a baby without the distractions. We talked with Marty, the hostel owner whilst we drank our coffee and ate the pastries I purchased yesterday from the bakery. He told us that he bought this house out of foreclosure and is working hard to restore it. He’s in construction and what he has done so far is amazing.
We finally got going about 8 a.m. walking down the street toward the bridge that would take us over the Delaware River and into New Jersey, our eighth state. The bridge itself was very long and had four lanes of traffic, two coming and two going. Lots of cars and trucks going very fast and very loud, it was terrifying with not much between us and passing traffic! After that we headed back into the mountains, the (still) rocky trail and the never-ending trees.
A little later, Stealth, Sparks and George passed us by, then Trash Panda, Super Chill and Seeker. I’m not sure if I’ve mentioned the latter three before, but we’ve crossed paths with them several times. Later in the day we caught up to Recon and Panda as well.
Kerry kept remarking on the scenery, which I didn’t understand, because it’s just like all the other scenery we’ve walked through. He was expecting bridges, railways and industrialization because that’s the stereotypical image of the state he has in his head. I think he was quite pleased to learn he was wrong.
We had quite a few wonderful ridgeline views when the trees thinned out or we crossed clearcuts for power lines. Popeye said she could even make out the Manhattan skyline. As the day wore on, we had some haze and increasing smoke in the air. There are fires somewhere, Kerry thought he’d heard in Canada on the news.
A number of people reported seeing bears and snakes today, but we only saw one very beautiful bunny. It was very healthy looking with dun colored fur speckled with brown spots. We also saw a bright red smallish bird, Kerry thought maybe a tanager. Toward the end of the day, we passed the most amazing beaver pond that I have ever seen. It was huge and we kept passing huge trees that had been gnawed through for dam and beaver home construction.
We were dragging a bit today, tired from staying up later last night and also because we thought we might take a zero day and didn’t because the weather has been so fine. The breezes were wonderful today, neither warm nor cold, but just right. We didn’t go quite as far as we had planned, but in the end it was far enough. Kerry just hung “his second best” bear bag; let’s hope so since the bears are active. We put more tick medicine on Felix, a little early to try to keep him from suffering too much from them. Kerry just brushed him and pulled a bunch off…we hope he got them all, if not I’m sure we’ll be wearing them by morning.","Marty’s Hostel at Delaware Water Gap

We made good time today. A good night’s sleep makes all the difference. This morning, we noticed increased haze in the air and the sun was a red globe in the morning sky. It took us  a little while to get our heads around the fact that it wasn’t just haze but it was smoke from fire, and that the fire had to be in the general area. There was a light breeze which kept the air moving but the smokiness seemed to be increasing.
Mid morning we ran into Chance from York, PA again. He’s the young man who bicycles north 120 miles then walks back to his bike and does it again. We haven’t seen him since Maryland, I think. He told us that at the next road crossing (Sunrise Mountain Rd), there was a tavern close by and we could get good water there. All Kerry heard was, “tavern” and that meant, “beer”. When we got to the road the Farout App we are using informed us that the Mountain House Tavern was closed Tuesday and Wednesday. Today, being Tuesday, this was a huge disappointment. Fortunately, it was only a little way down the road so we decided to check it out and lucky for us, this is the first Tuesday they were open for the summer season!
We had a lovely meal…lots of satisfying food, including desert. Postman (Recon, who we have re-named) and Popeye were there and worried about the smoke, they had booked a room for the night at a nearby motel. Kerry thought this was a good idea and tried to do the same but they were full. The next nearest motel was across town and the only transportation we could find was going to cost $75 each way, so we decided to walk 3.2 miles to the next shelter instead. That was after happy hour, a beer for Kerry and a glass of wine for me. We had good energy from the meal, so I think it was ok. It turned out the fire was in the Wind Gap area, where we were 3 nights ago. I doubt the smoke will be gone tomorrow but it’s not practical to wait it out so we’ll just keep walking and eventually we’ll get far enough away, or the wind will change directions or they will put the fire out. (Yes, I  know, wishful thinking).
Meanwhile, the ticks are out in earnest. We put new medicine on Felix 2 days ago and Kerry removed 17 ticks from him tonight. I had 3 on me today and I know Kerry had to pull them off himself too. 
We passed the most amazing beaver pond and saw where they had gnawed through large trees…I knew they had to do that to build their dams but these trees were quite large. It seems to be a work in progress like the Winchester House in San Jose, it’s never finished.
We would have had some great views from the ridges today, but for the smoke. The wind seems to have picked up this evening so hopefully, things will look better tomorrow. We had some deer excitement today, so Felix didn’t feel left out! And the ubiquitous blooming mountain Laurels continued to delight us.","Tentsite at 1311.9

Today is our third lunaversary since we started hiking the Appalachian Trail, March 7. We’ve come quite a long way and Georgia seems a long time ago.
We awoke to more smoke, a white sky and the sun a golden orb near the horizon. It was cool and breezy and the views we should have had were mostly white…once in awhile we could see across to the next ridge but frequently we could only see the ridge we were on. When we arrived at High Point State Park HQ, the ranger told me that the fire at Wind Gap had been controlled and that the smoke we were seeing was from fires in Canada. 
The light was surreal with the sunlight lighting last year’s brown leaves in a luminescent rose-gold that deepened as the day wore on. In fact, by late afternoon, it looked like someone had splashed a rosey paint around the forest. Kerry said it reminded him of the colors he saw as a child growing up in Salem, Oregon when farmers would burn the fields at the end of summer and the sky had the same haze. This was the overwhelming presence today, but every once in awhile the smell of wild roses would fill the air and I would remember it is spring. 
Speaking of spring, Kerry noted in the cool morning breeze that it feels like we’re chasing spring again. I’m happy to do that, I’d rather be cool than too hot, and I’m sure that will happen soon enough.
We had a lot of ticks again today, a bunch on Felix and a bunch on us..they seem to be getting worse, and they are painful when they dig into us. Fortunately, we’ve all become rather good at pulling them off.
Tonight we are in New York, our ninth state. Tomorrow, we’ll return to New Jersey before continuing in New York. New Jersey has been quite gentle, the kindest state so far. More beaver ponds today, what amazing creatures!
We’re staying at Sola (Appalachian Christian Retreat). Banzai (pastor Doug) and his wife Hot Drinks, open up their home to 4 hikers each night on a first come, first serve basis. He’s the pastor of the Presbyterian Church. We are the only ones here tonight. Banzai says this is very unusual, normally they have to turn people away. I think it may be because hikers are laying low due to the smoke. We’re happy to be out of it tonight!","Gren Anderson Shelter

A slow start today. We slept in because coffee was promised for 7 a.m. and we went to sleep late. We had a nice chat with Malia, the SOLA intern and then headed out for breakfast at the Horler General store. That’s when Kerry discovered that his (beloved) Tilley hat was missing. Malia said she would check with Annabel’s and the ice cream parlor when they opened to see if it had been found. In the meantime, Kerry found a hat in the hiker box to wear to keep the sun off his face. 
As we were standing outside at SOLA we had some excitement: a deer decided to walk across the back of the yard, and stupid me, Felix had not been leashed. As soon as I saw it, he saw it but for once I was quicker than him and grabbed him before he got any ideas about giving chase.
Finally, we left, and as we passed the pizza parlor, I walked up to it, and there in the window was Kerry’s hat! There was a guy, John, painting the fence in front of the restaurant and he offered to go in and get the hat for Kerry. Needless to say, Kerry was over the moon and I told John he had made our day. He took the borrowed hat from Kerry and said he would return it to the hostel.
Things only got better from there. At Horlers Grocery and Deli, we each had a wonderful breakfast sandwich of sausage, egg and cheese and another cup of (decaf) coffee. The serving lady gave us 2 dog biscuits for Felix just because she liked him! It was after 9 a.m. when we finally returned to the trail, but we were enjoying ourselves. 
The sky was much clearer today and the lady at Horlers told us the smoke should be mostly gone by tomorrow. We walked up and down on steep terrain multiple times and in between we walked over long stretches of “bogs”….that’s what they call them here, they looked like marshlands to me…on miles of elevated boardwalks. We saw a blue heron take wing gracefully over the grassy wetlands and heard redwing blackbirds singing; that may be the only birdsong we recognize because we have them at home!
We finally understand how New Jersey got its moniker, “the Garden State.” We walked through fields with harvested hay, over miles of wetlands teaming with grasses. We saw wild iris in yellow as well as in lilac/purple and at one point I looked at a mass of what I thought were white flowers, but turned out to be sunlight shimmering silver on green leaves.
In the afternoon, near Vernon at route 94, we went to a Heaven Hill Farm and had ice cream, well, I did, Kerry had a root beer float. Kerry’s dad, Jack, would have been pleased…he loved ice cream. After that, we walked up another mountain and another 5 miles to this shelter where we are now. There are a lot of other campers here. We’re not sure if we caught up with them, or they caught up with us. One of the men we met today is Chestnut. He is a retired nuclear power operator and he started from Georgia on March 4, just a few days before us. His wife died last August 14 after a long and painful illness. He walked 24 miles today, and I think he’s feeling a bit lost. It must be very hard to lose someone that way. 
It’s very late, well past hiker midnight and we have not found anywhere to stay tomorrow…it’s hard to find somewhere that is close enough to the trail that a shuttle is available for, and where we can get to for services (food and re-supply) on foot or public transportation.","SOLA in Unionville

A short day today. We made a reservation at Lake Lodging in Greenwood Lake, New York. It was recommended to me by another hostel because we really wanted a private room. We’ve been wanting to take a rest day and take care of some outstanding things. For example, Kerry would like to find a new pair of shoes and stay off his feet for a day. The latter is difficult to achieve given that our feet are our only mode of transportation.
We had an early start this morning but it wasn’t long before Chestnut caught up with us…we walked with him for several miles. A section hiker Brian and his 2 friends, passed us a couple of times as we walked along. As promised, we had more rocks and lots of scrambling. 
Early in the morning, we passed our final beaver pond in New Jersey and had a special moment when a beaver swam toward us across the water to where we were standing in front of the beaver dam. I don’t think that I have ever seen a beaver in the wild before. He was sleek and graceful in the water and when he noticed us, he turned and swam back into the deeper water eventually disappearing again.
At mile 1369.5, we came to the New Jersey/ New York State line for the final time. We have left New Jersey for good. We immediately found ourselves clambering over high rocks similar to those we encountered in Pennsylvania. At one point, steel rebar had been pounded into the rock and we had to climb it like a ladder. I wasn’t sure how Felix was going to handle it and Brian and his friends offered to carry him for us, but in the end, Kerry lifted him using the handle on Felix’s saddlebag and Felix was able to clamber up with the assist.
The sky seemed clear of smoke and high clouds beginning to gather threatening rain as promised. The Mountain Laurel continues to proliferate along the trail in various states of bloom, but we’re noticing less buds and more of it in full bloom. We’ve been following its season as we move north and it seems likely that it won’t be with us much longer. We saw some hot pink, very fragrant prairie roses, our first, but unfortunately, neglected to take a photo.
At Route 17A, Jim, from Lake Lodging, arrived and brought us here to the lodge. We signed up for two nights and went for a hot dog lunch, got rained on, then went to the “GWL Ice Cream Shop” where we each had a banana malt milkshake…Kerry with vanilla and I went with chocolate…they were wonderful. After dinner tonight, we may go back and have another for desert…still working hard to keep up with the calories!","Wawayanda Shelter

At noon, Jim, the Lake Lodging owner, took us and 2 other hikers, Acorn (a flip flopper from Harpers Ferry, whom we met for the first time and Harrison, “Raw Cat,” whom we met at the Outfitter (a diner/resupplier) a long time ago, to a shoe store and a grocery store. Kerry and Raw Cat got shoes and I got socks to replace my holey ones. The shoe store did not have the shoes Kerry wanted/needed (altra Olympus 11.5 wide) but he found a pair of Merrills that he hopes will work. They’re a little more solid than the altras, which may be helpful on the rocks and mountains coming up.
At the grocery store, as usual, we had to restrain our urge to buy more food than we need, m, mostly because we don’t need the extra weight.
We spent the afternoon listening to the news and catching up on things we needed to take care of at home (paying some bills, etc.). Then out for pizza and back in to pack up for tomorrow. It’s hard work taking a rest day…there is so much to do. Felix, at least, got to sleep for most of it!","

This would have been my mother’s 86th birthday. As I was thinking about her, dead now more than 50 years, I realized that I have now lived longer than the sum of years of both my parents lives! I have a lot of time to think whilst walking so I inevitably come up with oddities like this. I’m sorry she didn’t live longer, and I’m sorry for all the tomorrows we never had.
Jim, Lake Lodging owner, took us back to the trailhead at 7 AM so we had a fairly early start, but we had lots of rock scrambling and ups and downs so overall we didn’t move very fast. Felix pulled me over once, when he didn’t come with me on a rock jump. This reminded me to cut him loose in these situations. The risk of him chasing a deer, pales by comparison to an injury I might cause him or he might cause me on a rock scramble.
Today was an embarrassment of riches in the food department. I went and got coffee, a donut for Kerry to go with his left over sandwich and a breakfast sandwich for me. We carried a bottle of coke and left over pizza for lunch. After which we ran into trail magic from Sunset, NatGeo, his brother Tony and their friend, Joe. Still full from pizza, we declined the grilled ham and cheese sandwiches but had a bud light and water melon instead. Then a couple of miles later we ran into Wedge, who was also doing trail magic. We each had sodas and then he gave us German beers to drink with our dinners. I was worried about finding water…but what we lacked there we made up for in a lot of other liquid!
A number of people passed us today at one time or another:A couple named Poncho and Won’t Get Up..”Will” (man and woman, respectively)Acorn, near whom we are camping tonightSkipper, who we saw early in the day and then again with Wedge…apparently, we met both of them at Stanimals in Glasgow!Dice, a 66 year-old man we had never met before.
We also met a small group of Christians from the Bruderhof Community: Steve and Aileen and their daughter, Vernita, as well as Jane Magee. The women were all wearing old fashioned home made looking clothes and they were out walking to see the mountain Laurel which is beautiful at this time of year. Steve told us there are 270(?) people who live in their community, which is very close to the AT. 
We’re camped tonight at Island Pond…it looks like a lake and there is a cool breeze blowing. One of the more scenic spots we’ve stayed at. All the day hikers and family outings have left, so it’s very quiet and peaceful. It’s supposed to rain tomorrow, and we made a reservation at a motel about 20.6 miles away. We have more rock scrambling tomorrow, but I hope we can cover the miles as we’d rather have a dry place to sleep.","Lake Lodging at Greenwood Lake, Route 17A

Another birthday today, Kerry’s Dad, Jack would have been 97. I never remember people on the day they die, I prefer to celebrate their birthdays and their lives. Jack was like a second dad to me, as was Kerry’s Mom, Pat, like a second mother. They were both so kind to me and that is the overwhelming memory I have of them both. We have a lot of June birthdays to celebrate and I’m thinking of them too!
We got going early and slowly at first, but picked up speed as the day wore on. Harriman State Park was beautiful. Much of the understory was grassland, lighting up the trees from below, giving us the feeling of walking through a garden. And then there were acres of Mountain Laurel in bloom. For the past month as we hiked North, we’ve watched the Mountain Laurel go from bud to blossom to full bloom, and in the last few days the blooms have begun to “snow” on us as we walked.
At Palisades Interstate Parkway there was a detour. We couldn’t understand why they didn’t want people crossing the road especially since it seemed less busy and safer than some of the other roads we’ve crossed. We learned later a hiker was killed there last year, so it makes sense that they would want to avoid a repeat accident. Kerry and I didn’t know that when we elected not to take the detour, which would have made our long day even longer. The blazes on the old route had been eradicated (but now brown, you could see them anyway!). Others had an orange square added to the middle of the white blaze, as though we were on a new/different trail. If the ATC is abandoning the old route they shouldn’t call the new one a detour…it’s begging for people to ignore it. We met Forest (started at Harpers Ferry) and his friend Turtle on the old route and they basically had the same thought that we did. In addition, they were headed for West Mountain Shelter, which is on the old route.
Felix managed to scare up 3 deer, I saw 2 garter snakes and this morning (and during the night) we awoke to the whippoorwills singing. 
The views we might have had on a fine day were diminished by the threatening rain, but even that had no effect on our view of the vast expanse of mountains covered in green trees, mostly deciduous, for as far as we could see.
After we rejoined the AT post detour, we had a lot more ups and downs on Bear Mountain where there is a tower (shut and locked when we walked by) obviously frequently visited by the locals judging by the number of people we met headed there, even on a week day! What  impressed us was the amazing stonework and stair building all the way down the mountain to the Hudson River. At the bottom, there were information panels explaining about Trail building and how the stairs were made.
Another milestone: we went over 1400 miles today!
We walked on. The zoo that the trail goes through was closed. A nice man, named Mark showed us where to go to meet up with Grandpa, the owner of the Bear Mountain Bridge Motel, who came to pick us up. Like Jim at Lake Lodging, he washed our clothes and tomorrow he’ll take us back to the trail.
The rain that was supposed to start at noon, and later at 4 p.m., finally started at about 8 PM and we are very happy to be under a solid roof, clean and well fed!","Island Pond Outlet

We had arranged with Jim to take us and Skipper back to the trail at 7:30, so we went down to Dunkin’ Donuts for breakfast: breakfast sandwiches and coffee, followed by donuts.
Jim dropped us off where he picked us up the night before, near the bridge over the Hudson River. I’m so impressed with the size and the number of wide rivers we have seen  and crossed since we started in Georgia, I think there must be a lot more of them on this side of the country. The sun was shining and the sky looked scrubbed after last night’s rain. We  followed Skipper across the bridge and then said goodbye as he rapidly pulled ahead of us on our way up the mountain on the other side. The terrain was much the same as yesterday: climb up a mountain then down, then repeat. No views today, of course, because the weather was so fine! But it was very peaceful under the trees, lots of grass growing in places and the mountain Laurel everywhere.
One unfortunate result of the rain was an outburst of mosquitoes. We’ve started to have a few, but today my uncovered wrists and ankles were swollen with their miserable bites. They made me miserable too.
At mile 1416.3, we took a break at the Appalachian Market on Route 9. We didn’t know it would be there, or we wouldn’t have had such a big breakfast! Not hungry, we each had a milkshake and a large bottle of lemonade…that set us up for the next six miles. At the market we met Mary Poppins, a north bound hiker near whom we are camping tonight. A lone woman, she doesn’t like to camp alone….she’s from New York and close to her home here. We also met a Danish man, Lasse, who is here for a month and Goya A South bound section hiker who paints Murals.
At Dennytown Rd we met Brian (Soda Bread) from Connecticut who was providing trail magic: drinks, fruit, snacks and other goodies. He told us he comes to this spot all the time. Mary Poppins was there and we sat and talked for a while before moving on. It was getting late but we wanted to go a couple more miles before stopping for the evening.
I forgot to mention a couple of days ago, just before we got to Harriman Park, Kerry counted 12 C17 military transport planes flying over about 10 minutes apart. Something must have been going on!
After Kerry got into the tent, we heard a fox bark and we almost lost Felix through the tent netting again. Kerry stopped him with his foot and I had to give him a good talking to about not ripping another hole in the tent. Felix looked at me with his soulful eyes, like he was saying, “who me?” And I said, “yes, you…don’t even consider it!” I’m pretty sure he understood me, at least until the next urge kicks in!
It’s a little after 8 p.m. and still very light, a far cry from when we began in March. I didn’t get enough sleep last night, so I’m looking forward to more hours on the ground tonight!","Near Trailside Zoo 1410.3

We awoke to a blue sky and the sun shining and were hopeful that the rain predicted for late afternoon would come even later. Instead it came in the early afternoon.
We had a good early start and made good miles in the morning. It helped that we saw there was a deli off NY Route 52 that we could get to for a late lunch…the thought of a hot meal was a great motivation. 
We saw some more amazing stonework today; both stairs and some tall walls holding up the trail. I was struck by the juxtaposition of this obviously fine trailwork and the more neglected look of the generic upkeep of the trail. Although larger blow downs were cleared, the long (tick-infested) grass and shrubs were everywhere. I’m not complaining, I just found it different from the well-cared for trail that we have encountered since Georgia.
One interesting thing we saw today: an unconnected old fashioned telephone on a board near Canopus Lake (see photo). It said “Telephone of the Wind”..for people to call people they have lost. Since we have met several grieving people, I thought this was probably a kindness to them. I later talked to someone who had used the telephone and was appreciative that it was there. 
We had a few views high up today and we walked above Canopus Lake for a long stretch. This was where some of that impressive stonework was evident. It was a very pleasant walk today. At Hosner Mountain Rd, we were 1.6 miles from the deli off NY Route 52. Our plan was to go and have something to eat and then walk on, but as we started up that last mountain, called, “Storm Mountain,” (no kidding!} the rain let loose; thunder and lightning right on top of us. Kerry was counting the seconds between lightening and thunder, and the brightest flash was separated from its thunder by less than two seconds with an ear splitting crack. By the time we got to NY Route 52, we were soaked through and through (our rain resistant Packas, it turned out, we’re not so rain resistant!). 
We did get a hot meal at the Pizzeria, and then we decided we preferred to get dry instead of walk on in the rain. On the Farout App, other hikers had commented about how much they liked Cathleen and a hotel called, Le Chambord. It was everything that people said it was. Cathleen came to get us, washed our clothes and promised to return us to the trailhead the next morning!

We slept in today, sort of. Josh, the front desk person had brought us breakfast last night: bagels and cream cheese, bananas, yogurt for Kerry, orange juice and we made coffee in our room. All packed up, Cathleen took us back to the trail at 7:30 and by 8 AM we were walking north again towards Maine.
I remembered that I had left my second pair of underwear in the room…I guess it’s a match for Kerry’s warm layer that he left with Grandpa at the Bear Bridge Motel yesterday. Oh well, we’d been thinking about lightening our packs, maybe our subconscious was at work!
We had a very leisurely day. The walking was very relaxed and pleasant, much as it has been so far through New York. There was a wonderful scent of wild roses all morning even though we didn’t see many of them. I attribute this to last night’s rain…the wet seems to accentuate the forest smells. A couple of days ago we walked through some burn areas after the rain and the smell of fire was quite strong even though the fire wasn’t that recent.
In the morning we walked past Nuclear Lake, I spent some time wondering why anyone would call a lovely lake “Nuclear.” At West Dover Road, we ran into Brian, Soda Bread and his friend, Dave, who maintains the trail south, where we had just walked. Dave told us that there had once been a small nuclear reactor there and that’s how it got its name. He was so nice and I  felt guilty for my comment yesterday to Kerry about the condition of the trail. Apparently, he doesn’t like to ask for help so he has been doing the work almost single-handedly. He also pointed out, quite rightly, that one has to weed wack the grass by hand, it can’t be mowed as we have seen on flatter terrain. He said that of late, he has spent a lot of time removing graffiti, with a chemical he called, “elephant snot.” He said it’s a constant battle as some people seem to think graffiti-ing the wilderness is fun. Anyway, Brian (aka, “Soda Bread”) plied as with drinks and food (celery sticks and hummus) and both he and Dave told us to call them if we needed help ….even a place to stay if we couldn’t find something reasonable to get out of the rain. Dave said (really!), that we were obviously sweet people, and who wouldn’t want to help us? I thought this was very kind, and we thanked them both. It’s supposed to rain tomorrow and we need to re-supply, but Brian said that there isn’t much in Kent where we plan to go.
It was now after 3 PM and we hoped to get a few more miles in to possibly shorten the rain walking tomorrow. At the next road crossing, we spied the food truck, which FarOut said might be there. As we approached, the outside awning was being lowered, but when the owner saw us he put it up again. The food truck had a Malaysian menu, so Kerry and I both had a plate of Hainanese Chicken and rice, which we later agreed we could have shared one plate between us. Instead, Felix got some rice and chicken (I feed him that at home, so I’m sure this made him happy!), with hot sauce…and he ate it all up. He’s such a funny dog, he won’t eat just anything; he has a sensitive nose (as dogs usually do) and if the food doesn’t meet his standards, he won’t touch it! Kerry had a boba Thai iced tea too and the man in the truck offered to fill our water bottles and gave us water for Felix, unasked.
Today was filled with many kindnesses from people. It was such a peaceful day.
After dinner, we walked on ….we had lots of energy and the sun, which had been in and out all day was shining brightly and made anything seem possible. We expect to be slowed down in the upcoming rain so we thought it was good to walk while the going was good.

We awoke to a sunny day, a good beginning to a day predicted for rain.  We walked on and past the Wiley Shelter where we saw Poncho. I have no idea how she and Strawberry Shortcake got ahead of us. She told us that Brian, “Soda Bread,” had come the night before with table cloth, candles, wine and cheese! Very soon we crossed a road and came to a sign that welcomed us to Connecticut. And with that the terrain changed. No more easy hiking!
The trail was very steep and rocky and it seemed we had a lot of mountains to climb. I think I have noted the remarkable trail work we have seen….staircases of stone that I can’t even imagine what it took to build them. This made the climbing and descending so much easier. High up, the forest smelled of apple cider and tobacco, very different from the sweet wild roses of yesterday.
We walked on and shortly we passed a mother and daughter, Helen and Evelyn; they were on their first backpacking trip to hike the AT through Connecticut. We passed them a couple of times and chatted with them. We’d seen father-son partners but this was our first mother-daughter team.
Lots more blooming mountain Laurel today…I never tire of seeing it. Somewhere as we were walking, thinking about the coming rain, we decided to take Brian up on his offer to get us out of the rain tonight, so I texted him and arranged to meet him at Skiff Mountain Road. I thought we might beat the rain, but it came early so we hiked the last 2.7 miles from CT Route 341 in a light rain.
Brian gave us a tour of the Kent area and the town of Kent, crossing on roads that we had crossed on the AT. A different perspective on our walk. He lives in a lake community in Danbury and it occurred to me that there might be an urgent care facility, and there is. Kerry has developed some problems (a persistent blister and a corn) on his right foot so he made an appointment for to tomorrow.
We had a nice dinner (turkey burgers) and went to bed late, knowing we’re taking another zero day tomorrow. It was great to be able to relax in a home instead of a motel or hostel. Brian’s home is across from Candlewood Lake in a very pretty setting not unlike the country we are walking through. The kindness of strangers, what can I say?","Tent Site at mile 1459

We met Brian’s ex-wife, Joni and his grandchildren, James 2, and Madison 10 months, plus the dogs, including Ziggy, whom Brian is dog sitting for a daughter. We went shopping and picked up some needed supplies, especially deet to ward off the mosquitoes, but I forgot dog food. Brian gave me some of Ziggy’s and hopefully, the Little Prince will eat it when he gets hungry!
We’re going to send home a few more things to lighten our packs but we don’t have a lot that we might not need later.

Coffee this morning….one of the things Kerry and I both miss on the trail…we just have chocolate covered coffee/espresso beans and though tasty, it’s just not as wonderful as that hot black stuff running down your throat.
Brian made Kerry a tasty drink concoction (he said it wasn’t a smoothie, but it looked like one), which Kerry thought bore some resemblance to a milkshake (it had chocolate milk in it?). After this repast, we took our time making sure we hadn’t forgotten anything and tidying up after ourselves. Then Brian took us back to Skiff Mountain Road, where he picked us up the day before yesterday. On the way, he stopped at Dunkin’ Donuts where I got a breakfast sandwich for Kerry and me.
Before I go on about today, I don’t want to forget about a little magic we had last night. Brian, a retired teacher, went to see some of his students graduate so Kerry and I were left to ourselves with Felix and Ziggy (Brian’s daughter’s dog). Ziggy is very cute, some kind of terrier mix and a puppy still at 11 months old. We were sitting watching television and he was busy getting into stuff, specifically Brian’s couch. As we were sitting there, Ziggy came up with what we thought at first was play money, but when Kerry took it away from him it turned out to be a real $100 bill. When Brian came home he said he had no idea where it came from and did we put it there? We assured him that we did not….I choose to believe the fairies were at work!
I’m really glad that Brian picked us up at Skiff Mountain Road and not River Road on Thursday. We immediately had to climb up to Caleb’s Peak and soon after that we had to tackle the climb down St. John’s Ledges, which Brian had told us had been made easier by the addition of stairs. This may be true, but easy would not be a term I would use here; more like torturous…in both up and down directions!
After that, we had a lovely several mile walk by the Housatonic River before heading back up into the mountains again. I thought we would not see more mountain Laurel but as walked on toward Cornwall Bridge, there it was again, blooming away. I truly think we are following spring north.
We decided to stop at Pine Swamp Brook Shelter…we could have gone on but it would have been 7ish by the time we reached the next campsite and it’s Father’s Day! One young hiker passed us early and we met Just Todd and Short Changer, a couple of talkative south bound section hikers from Asheville, NC. Short Changer is a trail maintainer in NC so we told him how impressed we were with the condition of the trails. The two men were very nice!
I forgot to mention how every night we carefully brush Felix and go over him with our hands to find ticks. Kerry got a record 25 off him earlier last week. Tonight he got 10. They hide in his paws and legs, poor thing!
Our visit with Brian is one of the “people” highlights of our trip. We’ve met many kind and interesting people, but I think it takes someone special to invite complete strangers into one’s home. He did tell us that he doesn’t give his phone number to just anyone! It was a privilege to meet him and some of his family and he confirmed my belief in the goodness of  most people.

We started the day with a another profusion of white mountain Laurel: a symphony in white that continued all day at different tempos, sometimes a scherzo, sometimes adagio and at times so quiet we thought it had ended, but it never did and coming into Riga Shelter some of it was pink! (Apologies for taking liberties with the metaphor!).
We started our day on a slow note, Kerry has quite a bit of pain in his infected toe. At lunchtime we applied some antibiotic cream and new bandages and that seemed to help. We had a good day, anyway.
We arrived at Falls River at lunchtime and made the short detour to the cafe there hoping for a milkshake that we didn’t get because their machine was broken. We have been looking for a milkshake since New Jersey and have yet to find one! Moving on, as we started to walk into the village, the handsomest black bear I have ever seen walked nonchalantly across the road in front of us, he didn’t take off until he spotted us and I didn’t get my camera out fast enough to take his picture. Felix was very excited and would have taken off after him had he not been leashed. I know the bear could easily kill him if he felt threatened but they also don’t like dogs in my experience, which is why he took off so fast. This is the first and only bear we’ve seen on the AT, so it was quite a treat. After that we had a leisurely lunch at the village cafe (BLT for me, falafel wrap for Kerry, large cokes and 2 scoops each of gelato) before returning to the trail. 
After crossing the Housatonic River and walking a little way beside it through the trees, we got a great view of River Falls. The afternoon seemed to fly by. When we’re walking, it isn’t always physically easy but we seem to get into a very peaceful mental place, it’s comfortable. 
As we were walking along, a middle aged white man with a trim white beard passed us going south and stopped as he said, “I know you.” He turned out to be Mike 66, whom we met at the beginning of the hike with his wife Diane. Sadly, he is hiking solo as she broke her tibia riding a bicycle in Damascus when a child rode a bike across and in front of her. Now, Mike 66, renamed Manimal is hiking alone in some non traditional flip flops. In the fall, he hopes Diane (aka Better Half) will be recovered enough to join him for a couple of hundred miles through Virginia. It was really nice to see him again!
Later, we met 10 Cents Worth, who said he had seen us before. I think people remember us because of Felix. Anyway, he is traveling with a motor home called, “our dime” and a Jeep and slack packing himself up the trail!. We meet some pretty interesting people every day it seems. We didn’t see any AT through hikers today, just a few backpackers and day hikers.
Riga Shelter, where we are camping tonight, is under construction so there is no shelter right now. That said, there are a lot of people here. Thankfully, we found a spot out of sight and hopefully will be gone early in the morning.

Brian thought we had a couple of mountains to climb today, we actually had three; and that was only the ones that went up then down, there were others that were already up and just went higher. First, we climb Bear Mountain (2,312 feet); the climb was fairly gentle compared to the next 2 mountains, but the climb down the North side was steep and difficult. The second mountain, Mount Race (2316 feet) was steep going up and steep and rocky going down but we walked a long the ledges at the top for wonderful eastward looking views. The third mountain, Mount Everett, the tallest of the three at 2602 feet, just about did us in coming down. Going up on all these mountains was manageable but coming down was scary. It took us 10 hours to walk these 13 miles, about the slowest walking we’ve ever done. At the end of it were exhausted!
On a happy note, the Mountain Laurel Symphony continued, and just as we thought it couldn’t get any better it did: even more spectacular today! The dominant color was a deep pink and the blooming trees and shrubs surrounded us and ran deep into the forest understory as far as we could see. We saw more in bud today and less of the flowers “snowing” to the ground, so it seems we may have some time yet to enjoy it in its glory.
We are also seeing more conifers since Connecticut. We love walking on the pine needles, it’s such a welcome change to twisted ankles and knees on the rocks.
Our last three miles today were through forest and pasture and full of mosquitoes, our first day to apply deet, but not before they drew blood! At least the rocky mountains have subsided for now.

"Jo, Kerry & Felix",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665835,"Beginning a break…
Kerry got up this morning with the pain in his foot and toes worse. We walked down to MacDonald’s for breakfast and it was clear he needed to address it. I called the two podiatrists in the area only to be told they couldn’t see him….one said until January! The only alternative seemed to be to go back to urgent care. Hank took us to Pittsfield, a bigger town, where he works and to an urgent care facility there. This time Kerry actually got treated: he had a slightly in grown toenail clipped, puss drained and dead skin from a corn removed. I normally wouldn’t include all that, but he has been in increasing pain for a couple of months now and it was a relief to finally get some resolution. The PA who treated him advised him to soak it in Epsom salts and stay off it for 3 days. He also sent the infected material to be tested to make sure he’s on the right antibiotic.
Marooned in an expensive tourist town for the weekend was a little daunting. Geographically speaking, we have no idea where we are. We looked for affordable motels only to be told they won’t take dogs (service dogs included) and or their rates double starting tomorrow, ahead of the weekend. Just because I had Dave’s phone number (the trail maintainer we met with Brian last week), I called him to see if he knew anyone in the area who might be able to help us figure out the best place to go. He didn’t, but he did volunteer again to help us once I explained what we needed to do. 
This was a real low point for us. We had been moving along so well and we were in a groove. Having the rug pulled out from under us, so to speak, was discouraging. Two good things came out of it: the first was that we have a way forward, specifically, take a rest before moving on; and secondly, we got to reconnect with Dave and meet his wife Charlotte. Since this was National Hike Naked Day, we were also spared the possibility of seeing naked hikers….I have nothing against naked hikers, I just don’t want to look at them!
Hank took us back to Great Barrington and we went to an ice cream shop, to console ourselves with milkshakes and wait for Dave. He came all the way from Poughquag to get us. We drove back with him through much of the country we have been walking through recently. It made me feel sad and tired. There was not much more we could do. Kerry needs to get his toes back working. So here we are back in New York.

I was thinking about the saying, “hike your dog’s hike.” It comes from always putting your dog first on a hike, a concept that I have consistently promoted. However, recently I have come to the realization that we stopped hiking for Felix early on in this hike. I’m not sure when exactly, but from the beginning, Felix has been a very strong hiker and the three of us have became a solid unit. We walk together, we eat together and we sleep together. In fact, the one concern we have is that Felix has become very protective and when we take a break or stop to camp, he will growl and make noises at people passing by. He doesn’t mean anything by it, I think he is just warning us that trouble may be approaching and to please take care of it.
Anyway, he seems to be in his element. Today, when I suggested we go for a walk, he jumped up, tail wagging ready to go. And yet, he’s very happy to take a rest and sleep. On the trail when we stop he lies down and takes a “power nap.”
He’s definitely found his “inner dog.”","

Our third and final morning with Dave and Charlotte. It was time to move on: it wasn’t clear that one more day would make any real difference in the condition of Kerry’s toes and perhaps, more importantly, we didn’t want to outstay our welcome. Dave and Charlotte had been so generous with their home and hospitality. This has been one of the gifts of this journey, the interesting and wonderful people we would never have met without it!
We awoke to a gentle soaking rain; it’s been trying to rain for days and finally we have some real water falling from the sky. When I took Felix out I could feel the earth taking  in the rain like a deep breath of relief. The rain came and went all day coming more intensely at times, than others, but always gently.
We had a nice breakfast and then Dave and Charlotte drove us the hour plus drive back to Sheffield-Egremont Road where we left off last Wednesday. At 11:52 a.m. we took off across an open field and we were on our way once more. Briefly, that is because a mile and a half in we encountered some amazing trail magic. The local churches have put up a huge tarptent structure and apparently they rotate trail magic days. Today, it happened to be an Episcopal/Lutheran day and Harvey (Episcopal priest, who has hiked the trail), Mary, Ed and Mike were cooking cheeseburgers and hotdogs (they offered one to Felix, who was very pleased to accept!) and serving drinks, watermelon, cookies and snacks. 
Whilst there, we saw Dob, whom we hadn’t seen since …..New Jersey and met his hiking companions: Guide and Panda. The latter is hiking with her Shelty, Callie, aka “Little Lassie”. DOB told us about this chapel off Route 23, where we are staying tonight. Math and Samwise were there too, we haven’t seen Math for a long time. A little later in walked Raven and Sandman whom we haven’t seen in weeks. So it was probably a good thing to start walking today!
We stayed under the giant tent through the next downpour for about an hour and a half before moving on. We crossed RT 7? and into the woods we went (from memory):
“The Woods are lovely, dark and deep,But I have promises to keep,And miles to go before I sleep,And miles to go before I sleep”
Here we are in Robert Frost country and the woods are lovely, dark and deep. But thankfully, for the moment, I have no promises to keep!
We saw two deer ahead of us standing quite still and Felix watched them carefully…it wasn’t until they started running that he got really excited, whinnying and trying to follow. I also saw 3 of those pretty orange Eastern Newts, and a beautiful bird with a bright red crescent on his head and lots of white and black on the rest of him….he was quite large.
We had ups and downs but for the most part the tread was good. We had some good views through the trees to the east but the most remarkable feature of our day was once again the splendid symphony in white of Mountain Laurel. For the first time, I became aware of a flowery scent in the air: it was the Laurel, usually scentless, the rain had brought out its subtle smell, and it was all around us.
One surprise tonight, as dark began to fall, we could see the lights from thousands of lightening bugs in the grass. We don’t have those in California, so it was a treat.
I can only say, It’s good to be walking again!","Sheffield-Egremont Road at 1527.2

A little bit of a slow start this morning, we got spread out in the chapel and we had to pull everything back together. It was nice to sit in a chair whilst we ate our breakfast. And we were able to charge our phones as well.
We were slow hiking especially before noon; Kerry is experiencing quite a bit of pain when he walks on his injured toes. Concerned about the rain, I had hoped to get to Upper Goose Pond Cabin by late afternoon to stay dry. This was not possible given our slowed pace. However we did arrive here eventually, tired and wet and found no bunks available so Kerry is sleeping on the floor and I’m sleeping on an elevated platform with a piece of foam on it that passes for a couch. None the less, we’re grateful to be out of the rain!,
I was discouraged today at our slowness and feel badly that I can’t do more for Kerry. The rain is not helping matters either.
We had more of Frost’s woods to walk through and lots of marshy land covered in simple boards for us to walk on. We saw a lot of tiny (baby?) Eastern Newts and had to be careful not to step on them. The rain came a little after 5, no gentle soak today, but two great deluges that pretty much soaked us. I’m still wearing my wet clothes in an effort to dry them out.

The alarm went off at 4:45 a.m. but I could hear Kerry snoring so I turned it off and went back to sleep for a little while. Other hikers were stirring and we got up, dressed in our still damp clothes, gathered ourselves together and finally left about 6:45 a,m, A half mile back to the trail and we were walking under cloudy skies by 7 a.m. 
Today was a bit more threatening than yesterday and we really didn’t want to get caught in a downpour again but our options weren’t good. Our first goal was to get to the Cookie Lady, 11 miles away and have one of the much vaunted cookies and lemonade. Much of the water that fell yesterday had absorbed into the ground but not all of it, lots of standing water on parts of the trail and I had a new appreciation for all those rocks, the only way to navigate in places: rock to rock.
We arrived at October Mountain Shelter a little after noon and ate our lunch there, then waited out another downpour before moving on to the Cookie Lady 2.2 miles down trail. There, we met 4 hikers: Tango and Low-G (low gear), a retired vet who told me Bravecto might be more effective/is faster acting than Frontline and could be administered with it as it works very differently. Other hikers; YOLO and Cookie, the latter a southbound section hiker. Unfortunately, there were no cookies or lemonade, so we all sat and awaited for another downpour to pass and then the North-bounders hiked on to the next shelter 6.6 miles ahead. Kerry and I decided not to. We thought the shelter would be full and we really don’t hiking in a crowd.
That decided, we looked for a motel in Dalton and a shuttle ride. It turned out the motel was full and the shuttle very expensive. Just as we were trying to figure out what to do, out comes a young man with 2 cookies each for us and offered for us to stay in “the hanger”…the farm, it turns out, has a grass landing field….read that, “under a dry roof.” This we accepted and I think we’ll be ok, definitely dry here and we can walk on early tomorrow and see how far we get…hopefully to another dry spot. 
Whilst walking, we can hear the rain coming; it sounds like water running in a creek, first dribbling drops and soon we are in the middle of a torrent. Kerry says it sounds like an approaching army, one can hear the gentle thrum of distant feet and pretty soon the sound rises to a crescendo, and those feet are walking right on top of us! And we are soaked in short order.
I’m worried about Kerry’s infected toe. They warned him to keep it dry, which is currently not possible in the rain. He got a call back from the clinic that the antibiotic they gave him should work, but his toe is still inflamed and he takes his last pill tomorrow. We’ll just have to take it one day at a time. 
Since we’ve been sitting in the hangar, Staircase showed up and then Bambi, Reset, Lawsuit and two other young people. All of them were at the Cabin last night. Outside the rain is pounding down on the hangar’s metal roof. It’s deafening and I’m grateful not to be in it!","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

Short sodden day today. Rain threatens tomorrow afternoon and into the night so we made a reservation at the Zero Day Hostel near Dalton. I was hoping that we can dry Kerry’s feet out some more and stay dry. The rain will begin to dissipate over the next couple of days and it should be better hiking for us. In the meantime I’m working on my attitude toward it and looking forward to a dry spell a bit la Wendell Berry:
“After the long weeks when the heat curled the leaves and the air thirsted, comes a morning after rain, cool and bright. The leaves uncurl, the pastures begin again to grow, the animals and the birds rejoice. If tonight the world ends, we'll have had this day.”From A sabbath poem
At the next road crossing trail angel, Mike (Werthers…because he hands the candies out) offered us coffee. I think perhaps he had not intended it as trail magic, but he took one look at our faces and it was the first thing out of his mouth. It was wonderful…although it wasn’t cold, we had wet feet and we were damp everywhere else…it was perfect! He also plied us with pound cake and cookies, which we happily accepted.
The trail continued deep in water frequently, and it was impossible to keep our feet dry. At Cady Brook, the stones one would normally cross on were under water higher than our ankles in places and the rushing water made it the most exciting crossing in 1500 miles. I removed Felix’s pack and leash to allow him (and me) to cross as safely as possible. After that there was very little point to trying to stay dry. Later, I would fall in the mud and walk into Dalton wet from the waste down and a proper mess in general….but at least I wasn’t cold.
From there we moved on through more water and mud, I’m pretty certain that Felix loved it. Eventually, we reached Dalton, where we ate a huge lunch of sub sandwiches and copious amounts of drinks. Even I can’t figure our where all the food goes!
We got a shuttle to Walmart where we topped up our resupply and bought Kerry some light cheap sandals so he can get them out of his wet shoes as much as possible. Then back to Sweet Pea Ice Cream for milk shakes and more ice cream.
There were seven of us going to the hostel: Raven and Sandman, Karen and Larry (section hikers from New Jersey) and Yolo; all “grownups,” which was kind of unusual. We’re all in the same room, we spent a couple of fun hours talking, going to the store, buying food and beer for dinner before settling down to sleep.

The shuttle left the hostel at 8:30 a.m. headed for Dalton with the 7 of us on board. In Dalton, all of us except Sandman, who is waiting out a few days to heal his ankle, headed North out of town. Since we started late, we knew we wouldn’t go too far and we thought we’d be doing well to get to this shelter ahead of the rain.
We had plenty of mud and quite a few puddles but thankfully, the ground had absorbed most of the water. Streams, including the seasonal ones, seemed to have gotten a second life with the rain, and good water was plentiful so we didn’t need to worry about finding it for drinking.
I did not sleep well last night, so I was feeling a little tired but we kept up a pretty good pace and Kerry said his bad toes felt marginally better.
After about 8 miles we came to the town of Cheshire. Our first encounter there was with 3 kids who had a table near the street to sell lemonade; there was no way we could refuse them, so we each bought a lemonade, $2. The kids were very cute!
Moving on into Cheshire proper, we came to a small ice cream shop that also served sandwiches. Kerry and I each ordered tuna melts and a hotdog on a bun with mayo for Felix, The lady who took the order got the entire thing confused…most importantly, the hot dog for the dog, which came without mayo on a dry bun! Eventually, I got the mayo for Felix and then Kerry and I had two of the worst milkshakes we’ve ever had (too thin, not enough ice cream). Even with all this confusion and food that left much to be desired, we were happy to have “real” food for lunch. We sat on the porch and ate while the predicted afternoon rain fell around us!
After lunch, when the rain stopped, we continued on our way, and noted a monument for a 1,235 lb wheel of cheese, called, “the mammoth cheese,” that was presented to Thomas Jefferson in 1802. After we walked through the town, we started our ascent toward Mt Greylock. We had quite a steep climb but we arrived at the shelter before the rain. It’s not clear if it will rain tonight but we’re in the shelter just in case. Everyone from the hostel is here too, except Sandman. There is one other young man, Whom we have passed several times in the last few days. His name is “Roadrunner” and he gave up the bottom (double) bunk for us without even being asked.

In Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut there were a lot of boardwalks; some were over marshy areas but many of them appeared to be over dry trail. Now I know why; when it’s starts raining, one can keep one’s feet dry by walking on the boards. As soon as we entered Vermont, there were plenty of deep muddy puddles but no boardwalks. To be fair, some of the trail did have large rocks placed like stepping stones and that was helpful! I should note that Vermont begins the AT’s 100 mile overlap with the Long Trail.
This morning, from the shelter we had a 3 mile hike up to the summit of Greylock Mountain at 3,491 feet, the highest point anywhere in Massachusetts. Unfortunately, we climbed up in a solid fog that was so thick at the Summit we only saw a little way up the overlook tower and definitely nothing beyond it. At the top of the mountain we saw the war memorial, or rather a vague outline of it through the fog. The inside was very thoughtfully laid out to the memory of those killed in war, one of the nicest memorials I have seen.
Having to give up on any hope of seeing anything that wasn’t a few feet away, we repaired to Bascom Lodge where we had heard, correctly, that we could get breakfast. This almost made up for the fog. $12 pris fixe for: a lovely pile (and I don’t use that term lightly) of scrambled eggs, a pile of fried potatoes; a pile of bacon; a toasted bread roll with butter and jam; and last, but not least, a 4 oz glass of strawberries, blueberries and some kind of whipped yogurt. The best meal I had in Massachusetts for sure. We also had really good coffee, which was the frosting on the cake, so to speak.
After breakfast, we headed down from Greylock Mountain and then up Mount Williams (2,953 feet), then down to Williamstown and up again to where we are now. A familiar theme!
The weather seems to be improving; the fog lifted or we came down from the cloud. The sun came out for awhile and though it looked like it might cloud up for rain it never did and who knows about tonight? We have mosquitoes, and I’m guessing there will be a bumper crop of them when the sun comes out and heats everything up: something to look forward to!
We decided to stop at this site of the old Seth Warner Shelter (they’ve built a new one 2.5 miles farther on). It was after 6 and not crowded…one young woman by the name of Joelle came in and is in a tent nearby. She is hiking the Long Trail, 283 miles to Canada. I can hear her crunching around on one of those blow up mattresses that Kerry hates so much, it will drive him nuts tonight, I’m sure.","Mark Noepel Shelter mile 1591

Lots of mud, puddles and rocks, and more mud. We had a few boardwalks but mostly we had to weave our way on the obstacle course that was the trail. It seemed that this section has not been maintained in some time. People have significantly widened the trail by making walk arounds for the mud, then others have widened the trail even further when those walk arounds go under water with the rest of the trail. Whole rivers were coming down the trail in places, even cascading water falls. It seems like a few side run offs would help that situation. It was really awful to navigate and walk on and slowed us down quite a bit.
We saw Yolo and Stairmaster today, the latter planned to go into Bennington tonight, I think he’s tired of the mud. At Route 9, Woodford Hollow, three men were providing Trail Magic. They were: Gary/Dark Cloud, Blair/Short Trips and Broken Branch. While we were sitting there a young man walked up with a swollen ankle. At first we thought he had fallen but he said it was tick bite and he had Lyme disease symptoms. Gary was going to take him in to urgent care, so I hope he is ok.
Speaking of ticks, Kerry found none on Felix last night and only one tonight. So I am  wondering, where do ticks go when it rains, what happens to them?
The  climb down to Route 9 was extremely steep and included a lot of stone stairs, which given the condition of the rest of the trail was a surprise. Since we are now walking on the section that overlaps the Long Trail, we wondered who was taking care of the trail.
We saw many young people hiking the Long Trail today and this has caused some crowding at the shelters and elsewhere. We had trouble finding a place to camp tonight. There aren’t a lot of places to stealth camp as the vegetation is thick everywhere. We felt fortunate to have found this spot near the Little Pond Overlook.
We are both exhausted from fighting the mud, I’m hoping it will be better tomorrow.","Old Seth Warner Shelter campsite 1607.5

A really good day today. Kerry’s toes are continuing to improve and he is walking better. We made good time this morning, walking almost 11 miles by noon. We haven’t been able to do that in the last few weeks. 
The mud was a little firmer and what with stone hopping, puddle skirting and a little care we managed to keep our feet dry; no small feat! As we were contemplating all the ways the trail could be fixed, we came across a large work crew maybe 4 miles back. They were wearing Long Trail volunteer t-shirts so we stopped to talk to two of them, Kate and Kevin. They were young as were most of the volunteers and I only remark on this because a  lot of the trail volunteers we have met are retired. Anyway, we asked Kate and Kevin about the trails and Kevin explained the trails were poorly designed (probably before modern techniques were developed) and now they are trying to fix them. He pointed to about a dozen boulders that would be placed down the adjacent muddy pathway. When I asked him how they would move them he said manually, using leverage. I was thinking, it’s a good job they are young: the task looked impossible to me. When I asked about funding, he told me they are fortunate on the southern end of the Long Trail because a lot of their funding comes from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. The Northern part of the trail doesn’t overlap the AT and they have to raise funds separately for it.
We are in the Green Mountain Wilderness and Kerry decided that some English speaker  mangled the French “Mont Vert” and came up with Vermont. Sounds plausible to me!
At some point Cookie Monster stopped where we stopped for water. He’s with the group of young people who stayed with us at the Cookie Lady’s airplane hanger earlier this week. He asked us how old we were. When we told him he said he’d met a lot of people in their 50s who regret not hiking when they were younger saying they’re too old to do it now and had we encountered that? I told him that I thought it unlikely people that much younger than us would express such a sentiment to us. He told us he is 32 and used to be a chemist. He is from Wisconsin, but when he finishes the AT he plans to move to Colorado and look for work. He seemed quite nice, certainly more friendly than the first time we met him. That said, he walked on and took the camping spot for himself and his friends that we had been heading for. Of course, he didn’t know that, it’s just the way it works…young people walk faster and get there first! Consequently, we are camping at a true stealth spot, complete with various tree roots and lumps for us to sleep on.
It’s supposed to rain tonight and into tomorrow. We don’t have a phone signal here so Kerry walked a ways down the dirt road and found a signal so he could make a motel reservation, which thankfully, he did. This being the July 4 holiday and Manchester Center a tourist town, we were more than a little worried that we would be without a place to go in the rain.

For once the rain came exactly when the weather forecast predicted it would: 3 a.m. we stayed dry in the tent but getting packed up in our little space was tricky and took us a little longer to get moving. The sky basically cried all day and kept us nice and soaked. Had we been flowers we would have grown an inch and judging by the amount of mud our feet accumulated it wasn’t out of the realm of possibility. All the water that had been absorbed in the last few days returned with a vengeance today; we didn’t even bother to try to keep our feet dry, the rain kept them soaked and stepping in a puddle or two didn’t make any difference. 
We had planned to meet a couple who are connected to the CDTC  (Continental Divide Trail Coalition), Robert and Jessica at the Trailhead on Route 11/30 and we made good time getting there. We went out for dinner and then they took us shopping before leaving us at Pinnacles Lodge where Kerry had made a reservation. It was fun meeting them and talking to people who live locally….it seems like such a different kind of life to the West Coast: from the weather and vegetation to small rural towns and the extra time it takes to go places on some of the winding roads.
A lot more rain is predicted for tomorrow so we’ll stay here near Manchester another day to dry out. This may be futile but a rest day is always nice!","IP Road at 1643

"Jo, Kerry & Felix",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666383,"It did not pour today…we had a little sun and a little drizzle, perhaps it will rain tonight. We’ve had a nice rest day complete with milkshakes ($20.35, not including tip!) and another pint of ice cream each (for later) and sitting around doing nothing was nice too! This morning we were trying to figure out how we were going to eat today: we’re 6 miles from Manchester Center, near the trailhead but there are no stores or restaurants nearby and not much in options for transportation. About noon, the lodge owner, John stopped by our room and offered to take us into Manchester, a godsend! We spent 2 hours this afternoon getting our milkshakes at Ben and Jerry’s, lunch, and at a grocery store for food for dinner and tomorrow’s breakfast.
In Manchester, yesterday, we saw Strawberry Shortcake and Poncho, whom we last saw at Le Chambord Hotel (at the Curry Estate, Hopewell Junction, NY) a couple of weeks ago. Poncho is being picked up by her husband…she is getting off the trail, not planning to return, and going home happy with her decision, saying she was glad she had hiked this far, but she’d, “had enough.” Strawberry Shortcake, her hiking partner, will continue on her own. Today, we ran into Yolo, taking a zero day tomorrow at the Green Mountain Hostel (where Strawberry Shortcake is also staying). Later, we ran into Sandman who will continue to stay off the trail in an effort to heal his right leg/ankle. He was waiting for Raven and they are staying at the Econo Lodge, closer in to town. Our hiking world continues to revolve around the people we meet from time to time…they come into our lives and float out again and we never know who will turn up next! It’s comforting, like having an expanded family.
John, Pinnacles Lodge owner, had mentioned that he had broken his ankle playing softball, which Kerry had also done almost 40 years ago. Kerry’s ankle has been bothering him and John told him about an over the counter support he was using that had actually helped him and so Kerry bought one. I’m hoping this will help. As my aunt used to say, “Getting old ain’t for sissies.”
Yesterday, I forgot to mention that we crossed over 3/4s of the way to Katahdin. We have about 540 miles to go…the hardest 540 miles through the Whites and other rocky mountains. There was no sign so i didn’t note it, but today I’m amazed we’ve come this far!","

It took us longer to get ready this morning because we were spread out all over the room. Also, we made coffee and had a good breakfast. It was half a mile to the trail so by the time we got to the AT it was already 8 a,m,  The weather was supposed to improve today but naturally it didn’t, in fact, it got worse. We had several rain showers; some quite intense. needless to say, we didn’t keep our feet dry for long, and our clean pants quickly became covered in mud. 
Aside from getting soaked, it is quite peaceful walking in the rain….especially when it’s a gentle shower; it patters on the leaves of the trees on its way to the ground and creates a soothing rhythm to walk to. It’s quite warm too so it’s not uncomfortable to walk in. The problem for us is with the high humidity, it’s hard to dry anything out.
I thought about all those family picnics and barbecues that would have been moved under cover…it’s not supposed to rain on July 4!
I fell 3 times today, slipping on mud that got away from me. I don’t know what I minded more, the indignity of falling or being wet and muddy…yes I do…being muddy and wet does not make me happy.
We walked up Bromley Mountain to a magnificent view of…fog. I don’t think we’ve seen much of anything in the last two weeks. Then this afternoon, still wet from previous showers, we got to the top of Baker Peak, where briefly we had sunshine with a glimpse of blue sky and a view out over valleys bordered by more tree covered mountains. It was nice to confirm that the landscape doesn’t change much! And then in a few minutes it all disappeared behind clouds rising from the valley below.
On the way here we met a man with his dog; Charley Brown  and Snoopy. He told me he had been following our journey and was hoping to meet us. He started January 31st but decided to do a bit of a flip flop so now he is hiking southbound.  His dog, real name Wilson, looked happy and healthy, which was very nice to see as many trail dogs don’t seem to do that well. We had a pleasant chat before we each walked our own ways.
We decided to stay in a shelter if we could get a space, due to the rain. The ground is sodden and we really don’t like the wet! As it turned out we arrived at this shelter to find it empty after 6 p.m.! Since then, others have arrived, young people. But we will be dry tonight so the weather can misbehave all it wants. I just want a little sunshine tomorrow.","Pinnacles Lodge near Manchester Center mile 1659.1

Today we awoke to a sort of blue sky, at least what we could see through the trees and this was encouraging. We decided to wear our neoprene socks, thinking they would be more comfortable in our still sopping shoes. The neoprene socks don’t keep the water out but like a wet suit they make the wet more comfortable, if that’s possible. It turned out to be a wise decision because the trail was just as muddy and almost as puddled as yesterday….impossible to stay dry or even mud-less. 
We hiked along on the obstacle course to the white rocks area where the muck and water started to diminish and by the time we arrived at our current location the trail looked almost normal. I’m not holding my breath for this to continue but I feel cautiously optimistic about it,
It was near the white rocks where we stopped for lunch that we came across, “the Rock Garden” where people have created towers and sculptures on the white rocks. It was quite a sight to see this ad hoc ever changing/growing artwork to which anyone can contribute.
Aside from the young people we spent the night with (Swamp Foot, Cue, Shoelace, Perfect Timing and one other), we ran into Mike again, whom we met yesterday when we were being shuttled by John (the owner of Pinnacles Lodge), and we also re-met Hiram. Hiram we haven’t seen since that awful night in the Smokies that we had to cowboy camp on the dirt floor in front of the shelter to stay out of the rain. He kept telling us we couldn’t sleep there because he was an old man and had to get out in the night to pee. We were in his way…I don’t think he intended to be a jerk but at the time that’s how he came across. He remembered us from all those months ago!
Where the AT crosses VT Route 140, we met trail magic lady, Sarah. She was serving strawberry shortcake and Kerry was ecstatic. That’s his go to food for July 4th, and naturally he missed it yesterday! Sarah is 4th generation in Rutland County and she’s been serving up trail magic on Wednesdays for years. She was very sweet.
The forest is lush and green and today we saw more evergreens. We walked by lovely lakes and ponds and had it not been for the mud, we couldn’t have asked for a prettier scene.
After we left Sarah, we climbed another mountain and near the top I had a dizzy spell. I’ve had a couple lately, but I think this may have been due to heat. In any event, I didn’t recover and after walking another 5 miles, we stopped and to stealth camp, 2 miles shy of our goal when it became clear that I was getting worse. Kerry put up the tent and we ate dinner, before I feel better. Hopefully, nothing a good night’s sleep won’t fix.","Lost Pond Shelter 1673.9

It was an ice cream day! First, we took a little detour at Kieffer Road to Stone’s Throw Farmstead where we had a small (tiny really) tub of ice cream, followed by a pint each of chocolate milk (whole pasteurized milk with cream on top). Kerry also had a lemon poppyseed muffin with lemon icing. It was wonderful but not enough! Fortunately, at the road over Sargent Brook, we met Mike with trail magic including ice cream! He asked if we would like some and he got a resounding yes from both of us. Kerry had vanilla with homemade strawberry jam and I had maple walnut with homemade maple syrup (the best I’ve ever tasted!). I know I keep on about ice cream, but it’s the one thing we can eat that’s high calorie and takes a lot to fill us up. Not to mention the fact, that it tastes incredible to hungry hikers.. So even though we didn’t walk that far due to our ice cream lolly-gagging, we had a great day.
The other thing that slowed us down was at least 2 mountains that we climbed in humid heat (temperature in the low to mid eighties with humidity in the 70’s likely)This wasn’t easy but today we kept drinking water. I think that yesterday I was definitely suffering from heat exhaustion and the scary thing is that I didn’t feel it coming on. One minute I was fine and the next I was not. It was a good warning to both of us. 
Speaking of mountains, they’re back. We had a semi-hiatus since North Carolina, at least in steepness and they’ve been creeping up on us again. But in Vermont, there is no doubt that they are definitely back, only now we have rocks to climb as well! 
The sun was shining today and we had less mud to contend with, I kept my feet dry but Kerry walked through a couple of creeks instead of worrying about slipping on wet rocks. I had one good fall today but it was due to tripping on a tree root. I also managed to bang my head hard a couple of times on tree trunks that didn’t see me coming. My other name is the Queen of Klutz.
Several days with no ticks on Felix…dare I hope we are through the worst of them? Now it’s black flies in our eyes….Kerry wears glasses but I, and probably Felix too, are suffering.
Another milestone: we walked over the 1700 mile mark! 
Tomorrow we will have a shorter day, hopefully, a little over 6 miles to the road that will take us to Rutland. I/we can’t wait to clean the mud out of our clothes and put delve into our next milkshake!","Tent site near Airport Lookout 1690.6

Our 4th lunaversary today! It hardly seems possible.
We planned to head in to Rutland today because our son’s good friend, Francesca had put us in touch with her freshman year college roommate, Rebecca and her husband, Gian who live in Rutland. We also needed to resupply our food. 
The six mile descent from Killington Peak went by quickly and we found ourselves at US Route 4 at 9:25 a.m. Rebecca came to pick us up and took us to a Sensible Shoes store in Rutland to replace our shoes. Kerry still wasn’t happy with his shoes (Merrill’s) and my Altras were starting to come apart from prolonged wet and mud. Unfortunately, the only shoes they had in my size were pink! After that the three of us went to Johnny’s Pancake House because Kerry has been going on about blueberry pancakes for at least a week. All I wanted was a hamburger and fortunately we all got what we wanted including Rebecca.
After that, she took us to Days Inn where we had a reservation, with a promise to come and get us later and go for a Maple Creamy in her opinion  a “must have” for anyone visiting Vermont. Meanwhile, at the Days Inn, we did not get early check-in as promised, and more disastrously, the laundry was not functioning so we had no way to wash our muddy clothes. Since we were unable to check in, we walked across the street to a grocery store to resupply our food. Upon returning, we showered and then Rebecca came to collect us for the Maple Creamies (a concoction of soft maple ice cream in a cone). They were delicious!  She then took us home with her to wash our clothes, feed us dinner and meet Gian, her husband. We explained that all this made her a true “trail angel.” What could have been a difficult day turned into very good one.
The weather was another matter altogether; some very dark and ominous clouds gathered all around us and eventually a few squalls dumped some water. Our big worry now is that the rain will continue into tomorrow and beyond. We really don’t like the wet and Kerry’s feet need to stay dry if they are going to continue to heal. Rebecca told us the weather changes all the time. 
She will come to pick us up a little later tomorrow at 8 as it will be late when we go to sleep. We have almost 50 miles to go to Hanover, NH. Fingers crossed we don’t drown before we get there!","Cooper Lodge on Killington Peak

We were up late last night and I slept well, but I couldn’t sleep past 5 a.m. This worked out  just fine as we arranged with Rebecca to pick us up at 8 a.m. and we had just enough time to get ourselves organized, eat breakfast and be ready to go. 
We were on the trail at 8:30, a bit later than usual so we didn’t think we would go too far today. We were also concerned about the rain. It was in the weather forecast so we were certain it would come and the pattern for the last few days has been late afternoon thunder and lightening, showers and heavy rain. We arrived at this shelter about 3 p.m. and the downpour came less than an hour later. We were quite happy with our decision to stay dry even though it meant we didn’t go very far. It looks like this pattern will continue for some time. Our biggest challenge is figuring out where and when to stop for the day to stay out of the rain.
We had the shelter to ourselves for a couple of hours while the rain was bucketing down. Kerry read to me from a book someone had left in the shelter called, “Aristotle Made Easy.” It was very quiet and peaceful with only the gentle patter of the rain. One might imagine that it was a romantic interlude and I suppose it was.
Then Yolo arrived, wet and with a hurt hand from a fall; followed by Cookie Monster, Machine, Lawsuit and another young man from that group. A lively conversation ensued, which for once, included everyone…it was fun!
We climbed  a couple of mountains today and will have more tomorrow. I’ve been focusing on the rain and the mud but the countryside is very lovely. The sun dappled leaves on the trees and the many different smells of the forest all around us. There is lots of water everywhere. And I should mention the quartz we see laying around all over. Our friend Douglas tells me that in the 1850s, Rutland was one of the world’s leading marble producers. I wonder if it is still produced here, we certainly see lots of it on the trail.
Felix is already asleep…. I found a new high protein food for him which he seems to like, as he’s been eating it enthusiastically.

We are very discouraged by the relentless rain. Every day the forecast is for rain although it really doesn’t get going until mid to late afternoon. This pattern persisted today. By 3 p.m. when we got to On the Edge Farm Stand on Route 4, the rain again began to fall. Dana, the nice lady who owns the farm stand, read us the weather report for tomorrow: more rain and alerts for flash flooding with dire warnings for people to stay inside if they can. 
We had already made a reservation at Wise Pines Hostel, Woodstock, VT, for tonight, not wanting to deal with the rain and mud and Kerry thought we should take another zero day and reserve for tomorrow night too. I wasn’t convinced, mostly because there is no projection for a real improvement in the weather in the foreseeable future. However, upon reflection, I think he may be right. There is no way to really know when this pattern will break but we do know that tomorrow is going to be worse than today. I saw this meme on Facebook and it felt appropriate, “Procrastination is totally a good thing. You always have something to do tomorrow, plus you have nothing to do today.” I plan to enjoy my procrastination day!
Meanwhile, the three of us are staying in an hexagonal tree house. It’s very cozy. We can hear the rain gently pattering on the roof and we are tucked inside, dry and clean. Felix even has a real dog bed to sleep on so we are all happy and tired.
The walk today was pretty through the woods. We walked by Thundering Falls, and they were definitely thundering white down the mountain! We passed several lookouts but all we could see were trees and fog. At Ascutney View, there was an open field of fragrant milkweed in front of the view-blocking trees. I know they are a favorite of some butterflies and a sign nearby declared, “a way station for Monarchs.” I didn’t know that milkweed is so rich to look at, nor so fragrant. Now, I want to plant some when I return home…we are on the Monarch flight path, I think.
Now that tick season has subsided, I am contending with little black flies that seem to know they can commit suicide by flying straight into my eyeballs. They must be attracted to the moisture in my eyes, and it is painful when they make a direct “hit” there.  Maybe 10 of them flew into my eyes today in spite of my best efforts to wave them off. I think they must get Felix too, but I take the brunt of it being first in line. Kerry’s glasses seem to protect him.
We’re also suffering from the high humidity, more than 90% most days and quite uncomfortably warm whilst walking uphill with a backpack …hopefully, this will improve when/if rain diminishes.

The news is full of dire warnings about flooding and road closures and recommending people stay home if they don’t have to go out. It was all very discouraging for hikers but in some cases devastating for locals.
Robert and Jessica came today from their home in New Hampshire; they brought us the 30 denier Packas to replace the 15 denier Packas that didn’t work, took us to see the very swollen Quechee River and then out to lunch. They have been so kind, brought a little extra dog food and some treats for Felix to get us to Hanover, 2 days away. They came a long way to help us and they made our day.The river was raging over a dam that we couldn’t see. Jessica showed us a photo of the Quechee Gorge under blue skies and normal conditions, wow what a difference! She told us that below the gorge where the water was churning is a favorite swimming hole…not today, I can’t even begin to imagine taking a dip there. This was all indicative of the 1000 year rain event in which we find ourselves and at least one woman was swept away and drowned.
There are two days of less rain coming up and our debate is whether to push on to Hanover during this brief respite to keep us moving forward, even slowly. Waiting another day will put us in the middle of the next storm. I have to admit that having come this far, I’m feeling very discouraged.

Chelsea, one of the hostel owners, had texted me a photo of a flooded farmhouse 500 feet from the trailhead last night. It was beginning to feel foolhardy to press on under these conditions so Kerry booked another night at the hostel.
Meanwhile, I had contacted Bob M. about asking for help on the BSA retiree FB page for which he is an administrator. Although he readily agreed to this, his best advice was for me to contact the local Green Mountain Council, which I did. The Scout Executive, Mark Saxon very quickly put me in touch with one of his volunteers, Bob C. who lives nearby. He turned out to be a godsend.
Bob told us about the flood conditions locally and volunteered to pick us up in West Hartford so we could continue our journey during this break in the weather (without our backpacks). When he picked us up at the end of the day, he took us to a store to buy food. Tomorrow, he return us to West Hartford so we can continue to Hanover, where he works. Since he will be there he will keep our packs for us until we get there. He helped two other hikers also: Yolo and Strawberry. He was so kind and delightful! And all of this on his 25th wedding anniversary!
When we returned to the trailhead on RT 4, this morning, we found that the bridge we had crossed two days before was now severely damaged where it joined the river bank. Logs and other detritus had been swept up against the bridge indicating that the water had flooded over it. But the water had receded, proving that conditions were changing rapidly and what is true today may not be so tomorrow. For example, the sun was shining once again and is projected to do so again tomorrow before the rain returns the day after, on Thursday.
Bob C. had told us that the stream before Pomfret Rd could possibly be a difficult crossing. It has a cable across it to help hikers but the water after the storm is deep and rushing with tremendous volume. He told us about an easy work around by road that had the added benefit of taking us by Teago’s General Store where we could purchase lunch. It turned out he was right, we saw one person cross by the cable and the wild muddy water rose almost to his crotch. We on the other hand had a nice lunch at Teago’s and kept our feet dry!
We did have to walk through some watery patches but on the whole the walk today continued in Vermont’s scenic way and it was fun walking with Yolo and strawberry. We were delighted by a large patch of ripe wild raspberries from which we ate liberally, and we saw a maple syrup, “farm”; maple trees enveloped in plastic tubing ready for the next harvest.
We walked up and down the mountains and several times on top had views across open spaces and across the tops of trees to other mountains. Lots of wildflowers and mushrooms today and we saw Staghorn Sumac. The sun sprinkled through the new tree leaves and we were reminded that conditions in the mountains are unpredictable.
But today we moved forward and tomorrow, we will do so again!","VT Route 4 Wise Pines Hostel

Bob C. Picked us up a little after 9 a.m. and delivered us back to W. Hartford this morning for another easy hiking day into Hanover. We met up with him in Hanover to collect our packs. Then with the weather still iffy and because we could, he delivered us to a hotel in Norwich, an old but quaint hotel called “the Coolidge” (yes, named after Calvin like many things around here). Yolo and Strawberry are both married to other people and the only  rooms available had one bed each. The best solution that Kerry and I came up with was for the men to share the queen bed (being bigger) and Strawberry and I to share the full bed (being smaller), which is what we are doing. Another adventure.
We had sunny skies for most of the day but then the clouds began to gather again as predicted…tomorrow the rain is supposed to start winding up again. We had a couple of mountains to climb and swollen streams to cross but mostly our feet stayed dry. At one point we met a man carrying a plastic grocery bag brimming with Black Trumpet mushrooms  otherwise known as black chanterelles. They looked wonderful. He told us he sells them locally for $25 per lb. His name was John Wiggin, just adding to the feeling that we had stepped out of time and into a Dickensian novel. He told us he cooks them in butter and oil with salt pepper and Parmesan and spreads them on French bread. It sounded exquisite. After that, we started seeing them, black chanterelles that is, all over the place and I was sorely tempted to gather some myself. In the end, I put that thought out of my mind: no stove and no ingredients, but I will keep it in mind for future reference.
When we arrived in Hanover, we went to Bob’s office at the Rockefeller Center, collected our packs and took him out for ice cream while we decided what to do tonight. This is when we learned that the Coolidge had rooms. Bob offered to bring us here in spite of his other obligations (he was chairing an Eagle Board of Review tonight) and he did. When he dropped us off he volunteered to return us to the trail tomorrow morning. We didn’t expect this. He has been so generous, I am again in awe of the kindness of strangers; it really lifted my spirits.
We were able to eat a quick meal and purchase a few food items to keep us going for the next few days, especially dog food…we don’t want to run out of that!
Most importantly, we crossed the Connecticut River into New Hampshire at Hanover, leaving Vermud behind. We’re now in our thirteenth state, with one more to go!
At the hotel, we were all happy to shower, wash our clothes and go to a local bar for one drink, a margarita (blue to celebrate pride month?) for Strawberry and I and a beer for Kerry, Yolo didn’t come. We’re not making a lot of progress down the trail right now, but that’s OK. We’re enjoying ourselves again and that is the most important thing.","West Hartford, VT 1746.3

I slept quite well last night considering that I was in a strange bed with a strange (but nice!) woman. Kerry told me he didn’t fare so well. Yolo kept flopping about and hitting him accidentally. We all had waffles for breakfast because that was all that was on offer; that and protein shakes, which Kerry also had. Bob C. Came to pick us up a little after 9 so we knew we would get started late and that we would have a short walking day. 
We had a lot of mud to walk through, which I’’m sure would ordinarily have subsided by now, but every time it starts to dry out, the rain comes and we start all over again. It is supposed to rain tonight so we stopped in the shelter. Right now the sky is blue with fluffy white clouds. There is a cool wind blowing which feels refreshing and seems to sweep away the humidity.
We climbed a couple of mountains today including Moose Mountain, upon which we sit. There were a lot of very pretty mushrooms and we even found some small chanterelles. If I were cooking I would have gathered some for dinner. The mushrooms are the one benefit of the continuing rain; they love the wet and high humidity.
We had a lot of mosquitoes and little black flies, both of which flew into my eyes on a regular basis but once the wind started to blow, the insects went away.
Matt, Lucky Colleague, Danny Boy and one other that we met at Wise Pines Hostel are here tonight also. They are tenting so I hope it doesn’t rain on them. On the other had, if it has to rain, tonight would be better than tomorrow!","Hanover, NH Co-op 1756.6

Quatorze Juillet, Bastille Day. Last night, at last light, we heard a giant clap of thunder twice and then the sky exploded in rain; it came down in buckets and pounded on the metal roof over our heads. I was very happy to be dry inside the shelter and I slept well too.
Today, we accidentally had our day planned for us by Yolo. I think we weren’t paying attention because next thing we knew he’d booked hostels going out several days. This has the effect of slowing us down even more since he has planned 10 mile days. We may be able to make some adjustments, if not, we’ll just go with his plan and make it clear that going forward we will make our own reservations.
Today, for example, we arrived here at the shelter before 3. Ordinarily, we would have hiked on to the next shelter 5 miles away. Instead, we’re sitting on a bench outside the shelter, which is actually an old cabin with screened windows and a door that presumably used to the accommodate the person in the fire watch tower on top of the mountain, nearby. We’ll be even more protected in there if the rain comes. I climbed up the tower for some amazing views over the tree tops of the surrounding tree-covered mountains. The clouds drifting around in the mostly blue sky.
We climbed 3 or 4 mountains today, a total elevation gain of more than 5 thousand feet. These were not easy climbs, they went straight up forever and straight down. At one place on the up climb, it was so steep that the rock was studded with a rebar ladder to climb! Felix had no trouble with any of this, although a couple of times I had to use his pack handle so he could get his feet in place for pushing up.
It was supposed to rain today and now I’m wondering if it will. Another day of obstacle course walking around mud, over rocks and tree branches in an effort to keep our feet dry somewhat successfully.  We met a number of south bound hikers including 3 nice young men who stopped to talk: WW (double dub), Lucky and Rooster, and Mr. Friendly, who turned up at this shelter but didn’t plan to stay.
More brightly colored mushrooms today: they just seem to get more intense and plentiful every day.

We had rain in the night; several showers woke us up. We also wakened several times in the middle of the night to people talking loudly, seemingly having a good time. We learned that there were 9 (?) groups of students from Dartmouth University, participating in something called, “the Dartmouth Challenge.” That’s what another hiker, Mr. Friendly, told Yolo. I have no idea what that is but it definitely seemed out of place on a mountain top where a bunch of hikers were getting their beauty sleep!
We got off to a good start this morning…it was supposed to rain at 11 AM and when it didn’t, we changed our plan and hiked on a few more miles ahead of the more serious rain that is supposed to start tomorrow. 
Once again, we hiked up several mountains, including Cube Mountain. They were all straight up and straight down through the ever present mud and trail water features. Somewhere in Vermont, the steep mountains began and in New Hampshire, they seem to be getting more intense and rocky as we approach the Whites. Humidity is very high and we all suffered appropriately, but Kerry and I, being from California tend to complain more.
Aside from that, I never tire of the pale sunlight filtering through the trees to create lovely puddles of light all around us. A little sunshine, even filtered through haze, rain and various clouds seems to make the world feel right, somehow.
Tomorrow, predicted to be stormy, will be a short hiking day, at less than 5 miles. This will bring us close to the Moosilauke Mountain and notch, almost 10 miles of challenging boulder scrambling, rock climbing that is very slow going and which we definitely don’t want to tackle in the rain.. we plan to do that the day after in better weather. This may be wishful thinking. One day at a time.","Smarts Mountain Shelter 1779.4

A nero today. It was supposed to rain today and it did, but just this morning when we hiked the 4.9 miles to Route 25, the south side of the approach to Mt. Moosilauke. Tomorrow, we will hike it southbound from Beaver Brook. It’s a steeper climb from the North and we are told, an easier direction. We’ll see. 
It rained hard on us most of the morning as we walked to NH RT 25. Even the tree canopy didn’t keep the rain off us. It was hard going through more mud and the rain pouring buckets on us. The tree canopy created some buffer and had it not been so wet and miserable, the sound of the rain falling was peaceful in an inevitable sort of way. Knowing we would return to the hostel to get dry was helpful. 
Jack, the hostel manager picked us up and mercifully, stopped at a deli so we could get some lunch. The rain stopped, of course, when we got off trail, only adding to my feelings of hopelessness about the weather. There just doesn’t seem to be an end in sight. I should be grateful that we aren’t still in Vermont and I am. I’m sorry for all the people there who are dealing with flooded homes, which is so much harder than our difficulties, but it doesn’t make me feel better.
Tomorrow, less rain for the day, but more the following day when we plan to take another zero because the rain will return. The only thing we can do is keep going as best we can. We weren’t expecting New Hampshire to be New Mudshire, but that’s what we have.","NH Route 25C (Barn Door Hostel) 1794.4

Today we climbed up Moosilauke Mountain from the North side out of Kinsman Notch and walked South back to NH Route 25. It was only 9.5 miles but a very steep climb almost 3000 feet to the Summit at 4802 feet. I was quite happy we weren’t carrying back packs for the climb that was almost vertical in places. Some of the trail work was downright ingenious. How they secured wooden blocks to granite with no apparent bolts or screws completely escapes me. Kerry was puzzled too. There were stone steps cleverly interspersed with existing boulders that made the climb easier but not less strenuous. If we have more of this ahead of us, I think the days ahead will be manageable.
I had to cut Felix loose numerous times because he had to find his own way up the steep path at times, but we kept a careful watch to make sure he didn’t get distracted by any of the forest creatures. He actually behaved himself! When I had to cross Jeffers Brook, I removed my shoes, which I had worked so hard all day to keep dry and waded across knee deep. Felix could see he was going to have to swim, and not being a water dog, this did not make him happy but he bravely plunged in and swam across.
No rain today, but plenty of mud and water cascading down the steep trails. At the beginning of the hike, we walked up the side of enormous cascading waterfalls. I feel certain we were fortunate to have this view of Beaver Brook Falls. They were magnificent, rushing, crashing down the mountain in 3 separate channels at one point; it was quite a sight!
When we finally summited Mt. Moosilauke, the sun shone briefly, showing us hazy views of more tree covered mountains. Just then a cloud rolled over covering the sun and the mountain around us. A light wind was blowing and we sat and ate a quick lunch before starting the long and less steep descent on the other side of this great prominence. But first, we walked through a pygmy forest of what I think were spruces…very healthy and crowded as we left the alpine meadow.On top of the mountain, we saw McDuck, the Okie (from Oklahoma) and JFK, whom we hadn’t seen for more than 1000 miles. We met McDuck’s wife, Angela again at the trailhead and like the last time we met her she gave us all Gatorade! McDuck and friends  had fallen behind us but they started moving faster through Vermont in an effort to get ahead of the flooding. Later, we ran into Dob whom we haven’t seen for a few weeks and Uncle Sam  whom we knew was near but ahead of us. It was fun seeing people we had already met.
We crossed 1800 miles today! It was a good hiking day. It’s always a good day when the sun shines!","NH Route 25 1799.3

We hiked the Kinsmans today. Everyone warned us it would be difficult with a lot of vertical “non-technical” rock climbing, and it was. We took most of the day to walk from Kinsman Notch to the Flume Visitor Center where we got picked up and returned to the Notch Hostel; it was tiring but nowhere near as hard on us as we had been told…I think this may be because we didn’t go fast, especially on the rocky bits.
There is a lot of water coming off those mountains. Many of the boardwalks were under water and the trail, in places, had turned into cascading waterfalls. We had several challenging stream crossings as well. 
We started our ascent in a fog bank that started to melt away as the morning wore on. Then we had a heavily clouded sky and it looked like it might rain a number of times but it didn’t and we had some great views from both the South and North Kinsman Peaks, the best I think, we’ve had in several states. In summary, we had a good day and we hope to have another good day without rain tomorrow. Then the rain is predicted to return the day after, but we’ll enjoy the good weather while we can.
We saw Jolly Green and Chick Pea with Luke and Mr. Friendly (again!) atop North Kinsman Peak. Jolly Green wanted to help me across the stream yesterday because I look old, frail and apparently in need of help. He was very sweet standing in the water at the time in his underwear. Today he took a couple of photos of Kerry and me together. We also met Dolittle, a south bounder, who is staying at the hostel. Back at the hostel Uncle Sam and Acorn showed up…we keep running into them and Uncle Sam gave me his contact information this time. 
I had forgotten to get dog food for Felix, and Leslie, who shuttled us this morning, bought a small bag of purina for him and she wouldn’t let me pay her for it. She said, “it’s trail magic.” Again, the kindness of strangers!
All day, a Tolkien quote was running through my head, so I’ll leave you with this:
“All that is gold does not glitter,  Not all those who wander are lost; The old that is strong does not wither,  Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
 From the ashes a fire shall be woken,  A light from the shadows shall spring;  Renewed shall be blade that was broken, The crownless again shall be king.”

Today was brutal! Everyone keeps telling us how hard Mt. Moosilauke and the Kinsman’s are, and after today I don’t believe anyone unless they just say, “the Whites are hard.”
The hike up to Franconia Ridge was hard and long and then we went over Little Haystack Mountain (4780 ft); Mount Lincoln (5089 ft) and then Mt. Lafayette (5260 ft) and finally Mt Garfield (4467 ft). We went up a lot of feet today and a lot of them were rocky and vertical. I managed to fall straight forward down nearly vertical declines twice in the space of five minutes. I’m lucky I didn’t hit my head or break anything, but undoubtedly, I will be sore tomorrow.
Complaints aside, we had some wonderful views today, the best so far on the entire trail. This is partly the geography, but also the weather, which was not foggy, as smokey, or rainy. When we got up this morning the sun was shining….this cheered everyone at the hostel. By the time we reached Franconia Ridge, the sky was covered in high clouds: white clouds, grey clouds and black clouds and I thought it might rain, but it didn’t. By mid afternoon, we had sunny skies again; the weather is unpredictable, but the pattern seems to be most consistently for late afternoon rain.
We have also been told that parts of the trail are too hard/dangerous for the dog. This may be true, but if today was any indication, it may not apply. Parts of the trail may be dangerous for old people, but after I cut Felix loose he had no trouble negotiating the boulder hopping or rock climbing. Felix has figured out how to let me know when there is a problem. I’ve accidentally bonked him a few times with my hiking poles, or he’s walked into a tree branch and he lets out what I think of us a squawk, it’s a cry of pain. But today, he did it to warn me I was going up a rock face that he couldn’t clamber up behind me. That’s when I cut him loose so he could find his own way up. He’s a quick learner; he watches where I go and then figures out the best route for himself.
It’s clear that we will have to move forward one day at a time. I’m hoping we’ll get better at the rock climbing at least!

Almost as soon as we got on the trail, we were confronted with a very steep cascading waterfall that was the trail we had to descend. All I thought was that it wasn’t not as scary as it looked, it was downright terrifying, and this was how we began our day. After that adrenaline packed warm up, we walked a couple of miles to Galehead Hut where we were treated to left over cold scrambled eggs and cold, solidified, oatmeal which Kerry said could be used as mortar in a brickwork wall. It was good to have coffee, although even that was lukewarm at best. I must say, I don’t understand the thinking. Our AMC pass entitled us to these delectables, but they were served to us in the most unappetizing way possible. If one is going to offer a “benefit” like this why be so ungracious about it?
After that, we managed to walk a couple of miles in fog to the top of South Twin Peak. It was probably a spectacular view, but all we saw was the inside of a white cloud, once again. Then we walked down through the pygmy alpine forest and the rain started. It stopped briefly from time to time, but mostly it just rained a solid soaking rain all day. It would have been a nice rain had there been a way for us to dry out at the end of the day, but there wasn’t and it’s still raining. The forecast is for more rain tomorrow. At this point, I’m waiting for Noah to show up with his ark.
We had a brief reprieve at Zealand Falls Shelter where we had a bowl of lukewarm bean barley soup, which is included in the paid AMC pass, and shared a surprisingly good pulled pork sandwich (not free, $8 extra). It was a nice break from the rain to which we returned in short order. One treat ahead of us was that the first three miles was good tread and took us out on a ledge where, in a brief rain reprieve, we had lovely views over a valley with hanging clouds floating across from and below us. There were giant rockfalls and walls of granite that reminded us of the Sierra Nevada.
We walked the final 4.8 miles to our destination, Ethan Pond Shelter, which only had room for one of us and some of the occupants weren’t interested in making room for the 2 of us. Fortunately, Strawberry and Yolo were not far behind so  she got that final spot when she arrived.
Meanwhile, the camp caretaker, Solitaire, helped us set up our tent on a wooden platform. It’s not a stand alone tent, so this took a bit of jury rigging. Poor soaking wet Felix has to sleep outside under Kerry’s wet raincoat and in the small, tent vestibule. Needless to say none of us are happy with any of this. We will go to sleep and hope we awaken to a drier day tomorrow.

Thankfully, the sun was out today when we awoke. It was a bit of a challenge getting packed up this morning with everything wet outside (it rained last night) but we managed to get going by 6 a.m.
About a 3 mile walk down to Route 302, then up all the way to Mizpah Hut; first Mt. Webster (3910 feet) and then Mt. Jackson (4052 feet). We had been warned about some serious rock climbing (a friend told us class 2 and 3) and we weren’t disappointed! Fortunately, as we got close to the summit of Mt. Webster, Recon, Popeye and Reset caught up with us and helped us a couple of times where the rocks were vertical and over our heads, just a little too high for a Felix leap.
They sort of adopted us for the day and tomorrow we plan to hike with them, maybe for a while until they get too fast for us, which will probably be in short order. The hiking went fast…after we met up with them. There was still a lot of mud and for the first time, poor Felix did what the rest of us have done many times: he misjudged its density and fell up to his armpits in it! He was quite surprised and quite a sight! And best of all we had wonderful views on the high ledges we walked on.
We hiked all the way into Mizpah with them, arriving early afternoon. We had all planned to go on but the forecast was for more rain. Recon hiked the AT last year and felt that we should go with the good weather predicted for tomorrow. He thought the views were too special to miss. Kerry and I thought on balance we should stay and this would give us an opportunity to dry the tent and see if we could do a “work for stay” at Mizpah. They only allow two hikers a night in the program and we were accepted. In exchange for a cooked meal and sleeping on the library floor, we swept and cleaned for a little almost 2 hours. It was kind of fun and  we got to see how the huts work, an educational experience! After the hut hoppers eat, we’ll have leftovers with the staff, and the best thing is an indoor toilet!
Today’s rain hasn’t happened (yet), but it may rain tonight and we’ll be snug inside! We’ll, almost time for dinner 😋.

Yesterday, Recon suggested that we leave at 5 a.m. to take advantage of the forecast good weather. He also had an inkling of how difficult today’s hike would be, having hiked it before…and he was right. We didn’t arrive at Osgood until a little after 7 p.m.
We had a steep climb up from Mizpah hut to the Lake of the Clouds Hut at the Base of Mt. Washington. A cool wind was blowing and the sun was shining. For the most part we had great views of the surrounding mountains and valleys; it was very uplifting.
At Lake of the Clouds Hostel, we had plates of eggs and sausage, cake and coffee and this set us up for the climb up Mt. Washington whose top was shrouded in clouds. This we didn’t mind because the day was beautiful. As we left the hut, there was a sign that read, “Mt Washington has the worst weather in the world.” At the top of the mountain we found a lot of people, many of them brought there by a cog train from the valley below. 
There was a cafe, so Kerry and I each had a coke and a banana and wrote postcards to family to send from the mountain top post office. Recon took our photo at the Mt. Washington sign and then we all set off down the mountain and headed for Madison Hut.
I am very tired. The climb down to Madison hut, and especially up and over Madison was very steep and rocky. I fell 3 times again; my pants are torn and my knee is banged up.
Poor Popeye had a hard time coming down from Madison, it was steep enough to trigger her fear of heights and effectively immobilize her. 
When we finally got to Osgood, there was only one spot on a platform available and the intrepid three (Reset, Recon and Popeye ) insisted we take it. We were so tired we accepted as graciously as we could.
Point Man, on the other half of the platform, helped us set up. He has to go home to Dallas for a few days to help celebrate the life of his daughter’s 27 year old fiancé who died suddenly of a seizure, so sad.
In spite of being dead tired after a grueling day, the soaring mountains and brief good weather of the last few days have returned me to the peace and still place I was feeling weeks ago:
“At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless; Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is,But neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity,  Where past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor towards,  Neither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still point,  There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.  I can only say, there we have been: but I cannot say where.  And I cannot say, how long, for that is to place it in time.”

We slept in until about 5:30 a.m. Point Man, in his tent next to us, was already packed and ready to leave. It was 6:30 when we left not having made a decision on our destination for the day. We had enough food for the two day trip over the Wildcats, but at Pinkham Notch Visitors Center we also had the option of going in to Gorham for a bit of a rest. I was in favor of moving forward but Kerry thought a little rest would be better for us, and in the end he prevailed. 
We hitched a ride into Gorham with a nice man by the name of Paul, driving a pickup truck. We booked a room at a Quality Inn, had lunch, sat in the motel hot tub for 15 minutes and that did us a world of good. The manager has agreed to keep some of our gear so we can tackle the Wild Cats a bit lighter. In 2 days we’ll return to pick it up and continue on to Maine, now less than 40 miles away.
Sadly, today, Strawberry told us she has decided to go home. The climb down Mt. Madison was tough on all of us but it was frighteningly so for Strawberry. She lost her hiking partner several weeks ago and this also took a toll on her spirits. We are sad to see her go but she obviously has been thinking about it for awhile.
We had a huge dinner at Road-Hawg Barbecue: pulled pork over French fries, ribs and dessert. It was all very good, filling and probably way too much! Reset, one of the other hikers we keep running into, told me she met a hiker who kept losing weight and energy, who told her he found that more protein is key to stopping this cycle. This  makes sense to me because Kerry and I find if we eat meat when we “run out of gas” it does pick us up a bit. Our problem going through the White mountains, I think, is that we are putting out so much effort we just can’t keep up with the calorie intake. This just compounds the issue of trail difficulty.

Then on to breakfast. This Quality Inn only had Wi-Fi in the lobby but had a good selection of food for breakfast (including breakfast sandwiches and yogurt). I uploaded my journals for the last few days whilst eating breakfast.  I didn’t have time to include photos, that will have to come later.
Paul picked us up a little after 8 a.m. as promised, and drove us back to Pinkham Notch. There we crossed the road and walked along on fairly level trail for maybe half a mile before it turned uphill. From then on there was a lot of steep uphill climbing that became vertical periodically. It was hard, slow work for most of the day and it quickly became apparent that we would not go as far as I had hoped today, so we decided to go to Carter Notch Hut and see how we felt about going on.
I’ve heard the steepest mile of AT is in this section, and I think that may be true. The hiking was hard but we got into a bit of a rhythm and occasionally the trees parted and we had some memorable views. The sun was shining in a cloudy sky and the light filtered down to us through the trees creating lovely shadows on the ground.
It was already 3 p.m. when we got to Carter Hut. Kerry had some lemonade and I had hibiscus tea and at 4 p.m. we asked to do ‘“work for stay” and we were accepted. With the weather uncertain, it’s good to be under a roof. Also, because if we add a day to our journey on this section, we will run out of food and eating here tonight will solve that problem. I shall have to ration Felix’ food, but I think he’ll be O.K.
Sara, one of the hut employees asked us if we’d be interested in hearing a “green tech talk” on how the huts work and we said, “yes.” She explained how they bring in fresh food twice a week on Wednesdays and Saturdays they carry in fresh food on pack boards, heavy  wooden frames they strap boxes to. They routinely carry 75 lb loads. I told her I could not begin to lift that weight, never mind carry it anywhere. I think you have to be young and strong to do that job. She explained in great detail how the composting toilets work (and don’t), how helicopters deliver goods at the beginning and the end of the season. She also told us that each employee works 11 days on, then have 3 days off.
Reset passed us in the afternoon, she is anxious to get back to Gorham for a zero day. Later we saw Mr. Friendly leaving this hut…he is going up all the peaks as he hikes the trail. He is moving fast. At the hut, we met Butterfly, a section hiker from Alabama, who has walked all the way from Springer Mountain over a number of years. We also saw Dice, who we haven’t seen for several states.
One thing I haven’t mentioned is all the mica we have seen in the Whites. Bright and shiny it looks like silver shining in the rocks and it’s everywhere!
Just waiting for dinner, and I am very hungry! Kerry is reading a book from the hut library, “the best American Poetry from 2015” whilst we wait. We will sweep the dining area floor and wipe down the tables for our, “work.” Then sleep!","Pinkham Notch Visitors Center 1878.8

We were on the trail before 6. We were unsure of how far we would get. As it turned out, although the hike was strenuous and included some vertical rock climbing, it was definitely easier than yesterday. I think because the impossibly hard bits were interspersed with something resembling a real trail. 
We climbed over several mountains: Carter Dome (4832 feet); South Carter Mountain (4430 feet); Middle Carter Mountain (4610 feet); North Carter Mountain (4530 feet) and Mt. Moriah (4530 feet) . It took us most of the day but in the end we decided that we could return to Gorham today as planned. We talked to a family late in the day who were taking 3 days to walk from Pinkham Notch to US Route 2 and they had experienced the same difficulty we had with the first 6 miles.
There was more smoke in the air today so our views were impacted, but it didn’t take away the pleasure of walking under sunny skies. We are debating whether to take a zero day tomorrow as rain is expected and we are both suffering some soreness from multiple falls and all the climbing.
We are now at mile 1899.4, so we will shortly roll over 1900! Even though we have 300 miles to go, and our pace has slowed significantly, it’s beginning to feel like we may get to Katahdin!

The earliest shuttle we could arrange back to the trail was for 7:15, so we got packed up and had a leisurely breakfast. However, when the shuttle still hadn’t showed up at 7:40, I was motivated to find an alternative and I walked across the road and hitchhiked. We thought it would be impossible to hitchhike for the three of us to get a ride (2 old people and a dog!) but I had a ride for us in less than 5 minutes, I was very proud of myself! The shuttle driver texted us later to apologize for forgetting us!
Due to this little delay it was already 8 a.m. when we started walking…!and mostly fairly steeply up for miles, but we didn’t mind because most of the time we walked on recognizable trail, something that has been in short supply lately. The sun was shining overhead and every once in a while we would come out on a ledge with views of the surrounding mountains.
Lots of colorful mushrooms but the wildflowers seem to be gone now, it happened so quickly!
The trail was quite muddy but in spite of being in poor shape (boardwalks in swampy areas broken, missing, or under water and lack of trail drainage, generally) , we were able to keep our feet dry, a luxury at this point. I managed to take another tumble, tripping over a tree root and Kerry did too, bashing ourselves up some more, but thankfully nothing broken. I forgot to mention that we replaced Kerry’s Leki hiking poles yesterday. He’s hiked the PCT and CDT with them and had them more than 20 years but they didn’t survive the Whites! He lost the tip of one pole and the other was irreparably bent in one of his tumbles.
I also forgot to mention that two days ago, we ran into Chance, the hiker who is riding his bike to resupply, effectively traversing the trail twice, whilst hiking up out of Pinkham Nob.  He told us about some of the trail difficulties ahead. It’s nice that we keep running into him on his south bound sections.
The shelter has a lovely view, the best we’ve had so far from a shelter…out across a deep valley to the mountains on the other side. Something to dream about…
Staying in the shelter with us tonight:
“Easily Forgotten” (sold his house and all his possessions and hikes all over the world), says he hiked all but 600 miles of the PCT and kept his food bag in his tent every night because there “weren’t any trees to hang his bear bag from.” Also stated one of the things he likes about the AT is at least when there is a lookout, “you get a good view.” He added there weren’t really any good views on the PCT. Kerry sputtered in disbelief at these statements as evidence he hadn’t hiked any of the PCT. Hmmm…
“The Austrian” (lives 60 km east of Vienna, near Hungary, says it’s the best part of Austria!)
“Butterfly,” who we met at Carter Notch Hut, she is finishing her section hikes of the AT this year at Mt. Katahdin.
We saw lots of south bounders (“SOBOS”) today, and several (young) north bounders (“NOBOS”) passed us, including one young man from Ohio, called, “House,” whom we chatted with briefly. Found lots of ripe blueberries on the trail today—fresh fruit!","US Route 2 1899.4

We got an early start at 5:30 a.m. and it was hard hiking: first we climbed Mt Success, which was very steep, but doable. We had at least two impossibly tough rock climbs which one young man described as technical. Going down is sometimes harder than going up, both are slow going. One young man, “Gonzo,” who was behind us, but unseen because of all the trees, cried out for help which Kerry responded to by yelling out to see if we could help, but after a brief delay, Gonzo said he was ok and that the boulders were banging him up a bit. He was still in an extremely bad descending part of the “trail.”
I fell in a bog up to my crotch and in a near panic, as it felt like the mud was pulling me in farther, I managed to pull myself onto a six inch board. I looked like the creature from the black lagoon from the waste down and felt like it too. I was very uncomfortable, muddy and wet but fortunately my pants at least dried and shed most of the mud by the time we got to the shelter. We decided to stop here, early again, because of high likelihood of rain and thunderstorms late afternoon and evening.
We crossed into Maine at mile 1916.4 and met a man going southbound who declared, “I’m so glad to be done with Maine.” I was just thinking how happy we are to have New Hampshire behind us, it’s been tough! We met another couple, “Time and a Half” and “No Complaints,” from Utah, who plan to slackpack some of the mountains north of Grafton Notch. They promised to forward their contacts and plan. Slack packing sounds good right now. Balancing with a full pack on some of these rock climbs is dangerous to say the least.
Tomorrow, we tackle the infamous Mahoosuc Notch and the Arm. We know it will be slow going, but that’s OK. I just hope it isn’t too hard for us.
As predicted, the rain has come, and it’s time for dinner!

Since we started hiking the Whites, people have told us successive sections are the most  difficult: Mt. Moosilauke, the Kinsman’s, the Presidentials, the Wildcats etc. But today, I think we may have hiked the most difficult 9.7 miles. It took us almost 12 hours to hike up one mountain, through the Mahoosuc Notch (about a mile of loose boulders designed to break bones, if not managed carefully); then a climb 1500 feet almost straight up to the Mahoosuc Arm, then down to Speck Pond and straight up to Old Speck (Maine’s third highest mountain at 4170 feet) and finally down to Grafton Notch.
We both managed a fall today (again) and our legs and other body parts look pretty beat up…We’ll both take ibuprofen tonight!
After the morning fog burned off, we had lovely sunny skies, although the clouds were always there, I suppose to remind us that the rain will return soon. The terrain as tough as it is to traverse is really beautiful. I’ve said before the granite is reminiscent of the Sierra Nevada, but the coniferous trees on the mountain tops are crowded and stunted at maybe 20 feet or so, and there is a ubiquitous soft bright green moss all over the forest floor that seems to light up it from within. It is very rich and soothing to look at. Everywhere on the ground, Mica shines like a million silver stars. We saw garter snakes, as we have almost everyday for the past week too.
We were dead tired when we arrived at Grafton Notch shortly before 6. It had taken us almost 12 hours to hike less than 10 miles. Once there we asked a group of day hikers, Mike, his 15 year-old grandson, Malachi and friend, Jeremy if they were going the Bethel direction, if they would give us a ride and they said, “yes,”  Since they were hungry, we all stopped for dinner at the Sunday River Diner and had a great meal (Kerry and I had very good hamburgers, and he later said that he could have eaten another one! But we have a beer!). Mike and Jeremy are truck drivers, and this was Jeremy’s first hike. They climbed Old Speck.
After dinner they dropped us at the West Bethel Motel. We had hoped to slack tomorrow with Time and a Half and No Complaints, but Aaron, the motel guy and shuttle driver, told us his vehicle is not big enough, so we’ll have to figure out what to do tomorrow. Meanwhile, sleep!","Full Goose Shelter 1921.3

An angel came to our rescue today. Candice who is living in the long term stay section of the motel, drove the three of us to Grafton Notch, with instructions on where on East B Hill to pick us up. She told us she has a Christian ministry. We started climbing up the mountain toward East Bald Pate, aptly named because once you are on top it’s all bald granite with views in every direction. 
We got rained on but lightly, and we walked through the woods on better paths and perhaps a little less steep than what we have had lately. We met Irish, hiking all the way from Florida, and later, we met Grateful at Frye Shelter waiting for a friend. Near East B Hill Rd we caught up with three men that stayed at West Bethel Motel last night, and who fed Kerry pancakes for breakfast.
When we finally reached the road, there was Candice waiting for us! She took us back to the motel to pick up our laundry…the motel washer isn’t working, although Aaron seems to be in denial about this. Anyway, we all, including Candice, got our clothes washed, went to Walmart and then had a late dinner at MacDonalds because everything else was closed.
We came to this motel specifically because Aaron helps with shuttles, but he kept telling us he had no room. We finally figured out that under no circumstances would he take Felix (and he has a dog!). He should have said that up front, it would have made things a lot less stressful for us.

We had a great day! The sun was shining in a blue and partially clouded sky when Candice dropped us off this morning at East B Hill Road. We started a gradual then more steep ascent of Wyman Mountain as soon as we left the road. The trail was still muddy, rooty and rocky in places but we kept up a good pace in the forest. 
The sun shone on us alternately with clouds shadowing us through the mostly coniferous forest. Lots more mushrooms today, including some tantalizing chanterelles that I would have picked if I could have cooked our dinner! We saw lots of bunchberries and a new blue flower that looked a bit like a blueberry. What was different about it was that Felix sniffed it and, had we not stopped him, he would have eaten it! Since we didn’t know what it was we thought that was not a good idea! The forest understory, sometimes brown with last year’s dead leaves, sometimes magically mossy, was easy on our eyes and spirits and we walked along and chatted like a couple of kids out to play. 
We had bought pre-made sandwiches for lunch at Walmart yesterday and it was a treat to have real food to eat instead of protein bars. I shared my sandwich with Felix because we had inadvertently put his lunch treats somewhere and couldn’t find them.
We were surprised today meeting up again with the three fellows that fed Kerry strawberry banana pancakes three days ago and which he is still talking about, the pancakes that is. This time we introduced ourselves and their names are: Cash Money (a Catholic priest on Sabbatical from St. Louis, MO); Oatie (an IT business owner and PK, like Kerry, from Pennsylvania) and Garfield (retired floor installer from Delaware). We had a great time talking with them and ended up at the Cabin (hostel) this evening.
And the Cabin! What a great hostel! It’s run by Honey (Margery Towne), and she and her helpers make an optional home cooked meal for both Breakfast and dinner. Tonight, we had garden fresh green beans, sweet potatoes, coleslaw and ham, followed by ice cream and buttery toffee bars for dessert. The vegetables were from her garden and all of it was wonderful! They let me have a piece of ham for Felix, so between lunch and dinner, he had a good day too!
Tomorrow, after breakfast, we will slack pack another 10 + miles to ME 17, then return here for another we’ll-earned dinner. The slack packing is doing us all, including Felix, a world of good. Everything seems possible again!","East Bethel Hill Road 1941.3

We had blueberry pancakes for breakfast (also, eggs, fried potatoes and sausages). I only remark on this because Kerry’s favorite breakfast is blueberry pancakes and everything was cooked so well, it was delicious. 
After breakfast, we all piled in a car and headed back to South Arm Road to begin the next segment: up and over Old Blue Mountain (3600 feet), then Bemis Mountain (3564 feet) and finally, Bemis Mountain Second Peak (2880 feet). Some of it was steep and strenuous but nothing like as hard as a week ago. Some of the time we walked with Time and a Half and No Complaints but mostly we walked alone.
We had some lovely views…as always: mountains covered in trees as far as we can see!
When the sun shines, as it did intermittently today, it lifts my mood. Maybe I’m sensitized to it spending so much time outdoors. I just find that interesting. Anyway, we had lots of mud today and broken boardwalks upon which to walk. We kept our feet dry until the final stream: I took my shoes and socks off but Kerry walked through it as did Felix so they both had wet feet.
At Bemis Mountain Road, we had some wonderful trail magic. Six old people (even older than us, including two Donna’s and a fellow they called the Entertainer), apparently come every Wednesday and cook meals for hikers. This week it was a wonderful pasta salad, cream of tomato soup, hamburgers and red-colored hot dogs called, “red snappers,” a Maine delicacy.They gave Felix some American cheese and even though he loves cheese, it seems that he does not like processed cheese. He ate the red snapper though, that little prince!
On route ME 17, where we ended our day, we had a great view of a huge lake with an unpronounceable name! But it was a happy ending to our walk. We came back to the Cabin for a second night and another great meal of lasagne, salad, garlic bread, ice cream and shortbread. Tomorrow, we head out on what is supposed to be the easiest (read “less mountainous”) section in Maine….sounds good to me!","South Arm Road 1951.4

Another great breakfast (more blueberry pancakes etc whipped up by Kitchen Sink, whom I thanked profusely…I think he was pleased, he said he would tell his mother because she didn’t think he could cook!). We’ve stayed at many great hostels but I have to say that on the food alone this is my favorite. Having two great meals a day (breakfast and dinner) makes a huge contribution to our energy level.
Back to ME 17 for the easiest 13 miles in Maine…and for once, at least to this point, this is is the easiest we have walked so far….in fact since Vermont at least. Still hilly, but not mountainous it was a very enjoyable walk and we were again graced with intermittent sunshine that reminded me of John Denver’s song:
“Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happySunshine in my eyes can make me crySunshine on the water looks so lovelySunshine almost always makes me high
If I had a day that I could give youI'd give to you a day just like todayIf I had a song that I could sing for youI'd sing a song to make you feel this way”
As the day wore on the sun disappeared behind a darkening cloud cover, throwing a dampener on my mood, the rain is coming and tomorrow is supposed to be a rain day. 
We saw more of those blue-berried Lilly plants I mentioned a few days ago that Felix was so intrigued about and wanted to eat. Kerry looked them up: they’re called blue-bead lillies and although the young leaves are edible, the berries are poisonous, and it was the berries he wanted to eat. Felix had the same reaction to them today. He’s a meat dog, not keen on vegetables or fruit but he really wanted to try those berries!
We walked through a lot of mud again today, broken boardwalks and trail under water. However, a couple of miles before Route 4, we ran into 4 young people (spoke to Abby and RJ) who are on a summer work program with the Maine Conservation Corps. They were smashing rocks to create a stable base on to which they would move large rocks to make raised stepping stones to mitigate the water issue on the trail. I have no idea how they move those rocks, they must be incredibly heavy but they are definitely more durable than wooden boards.
We have been noticing a lot of lakes and ponds since we entered Maine and after looking at a map of Maine, it looks like it’s riddled with large bodies of water, I had no idea! We walked past a meadow, the first we’ve seen in many weeks, and saw a lot of moose scat today. We thought that meadow might be a hangout for them.
We arrived at ME 4 at 3:30 and got to Rangely, Maine and the Saddleback Inn where we will stay tonight in time to have a restful unrushed evening. Our ride back to the trail tomorrow fell through (car trouble) but Richard has found someone to slack pack us again. This is a big relief since tomorrow is supposed to be another rainy day!

I didn’t sleep well last night, i think it was because I drank coke in the evening. We had a 6:30 a.m. pick up back to the trail this morning so it was a short night. Outside the sky was covered in grey clouds and it looked like we had quite a bit of rain last night. Andrea's knee has been bothering her so she elected to take a zero day instead of hiking on. 
We started up Saddleback Mountain in a light rain that became a little more insistent. Even when the rain lightened and stopped, it was quite dark under a leaden sky and the tree cover; it felt like twilight and the coming of the night.
When we finally climbed above tree line, we walked in a cloud so thick that we couldn't see more than 20 to 30 feet in any direction. it reminded me of Conan-Doyle's “Hound of the Baskervilles” on the moors in the North of England, shadowy and frightening. I wasn’t frightened, but it had that ""Twilight Zone"" kind of feel.
Since we walked over Saddleback (4120 feet), the Horn (4041 feet) and Saddleback Jr. (3655 feet) in the fog, we didn't see the wonderful views that must have been there. Instead, in my mind's eye I imagined the vistas of mountains stretching into the distance, blue with the millions of trees that call these mountains home. And because we're in Maine, there would be lakes in the valleys too. And, to the West, Canada is about an hour away!
We took a 1 1/2 mile detour down a dirt road to meet our arranged shuttle driver, Dave. we arrived a little after 4 p.m. a half hour early, but two hours later, he still hadn’t arrived. It was getting cooler and we were worried, with no cell service we were unable to call for help. Fortunately, Rich had an InReach Mini satellite communication device, and after some back and forth, the Jens, who own the Maine Roadhouse Hostel, sent a friend 
 and neighbor, Adam, to pick us up. He was wonderful and offered to bring us back to this section of the trail, the day after tomorrow, Sunday. We later ran into Dave, who apparently misunderstood where to meet us for the pick-up. The result of all this was that in addition to our trail miles, we walked an extra 5 to 6 miles, making this a 19 to 20 mile day.
We arrived at the hostel, wet and exhausted at about 8 p.m. Kerry and I are in the Jens’ recently purchased motel, the Stratton Motel, as they have no room at the hostel tonight. They brought us beer and Gatorade, pizza and dessert and loaner clothes while we do our laundry. All I had for them was a giant cucumber that Adam gave me, which by the way they were delighted to receive.
This was not how we expected to end our day. We are very tired and plan to have a shorter hiking day tomorrow as a result. The adventure always evolving.…it continues!","ME Route 4 1977.8

We skipped ahead to Caribou Valley Road for a short hike to ME 27 of 8.3 miles, Tomorrow,  we’ll return to Old Raiiroad Road to complete the section to Caribou Road. We did this for two reasons: we wanted a shorter hike today and Adam, who brought us out yesterday, was only available tomorrow to take us back as he was working today.
We walked vertically up South Crawford Mountain and then perhaps a little less vertically up North Crawford Mountain. I’m wondering why they built the trails this way….perhaps they thought shorter (straight vertical line) is better than a nice easy long zigzag switchback? Or that difficult is good for character building? Anyway, the endurance is not a problem, we don’t even get winded, it’s the constant rock climbing that is challenging!  That said, it was not a difficult hike today, in fact, it was fun!
There were many moments when the sunlight filtered through the trees and puddled on the ground around us that it actually felt like a summer day. A light breeze kept us comfortable and blew away some of the moisture (humidity) that kept fogging up Kerry’s glasses so he was happy too.
We let Felix have some off leash time whilst climbing up the steepest and rockiest part of the trail. He’s doing very well with this and it gives him a little extra sniffage time to explore all the wonderful forest smells. We have to keep a careful watch on him lest he go into “hunt” mode, then it’s back to leash prison!
It was a lot like walking in a park today; frequently on a granite path where the bright green moss frames the trail like it was planted just so. The mushrooms are so diverse and numerous, we’ve even given up photographing all of them. I never get tired of the fairly unchanging landscape, I find it soothing somehow.
At 2:30, we reached Caribou Road, where John Webster (a descendent of Daniel, he admitted when asked) plied us with drinks and snacks (including a “Little Debbie”  snack of Bill Bryson fame) whilst we awaited the hostel to pick us up. As we sat there, Kerry with his beer and Little Debbie, the sheriff drove up with his own trail magic. We had heard that he likes to help hikers, but it was still quite a sight to see him pull up with his young son in tow! It felt like we were in another country.
After we returned to the hostel, washed our clothes and washed ourselves and we each had a pint of Cherry Garcia ice cream, followed by dinner with Andrea and Rich at Brickyard Hollow where we had our first Maine Lobster Rolls in Maine….they were great!

Another glorious Summer Day (the second in a row!)! Adam picked us (Kerry, Rich, Felix and I) up at 6:30 AM and dropped us, 1 1/2 hours later, 1.5 miles from the trailhead, where we should have been picked up 2 days ago. We walked back on the rocky road to the trailhead and started up the usual steep climb, this time up Lone Mountain (3261 feet). On the way up, we passed Sour Patch and Burrito. At the top, we ran into Oatie, Garfield, Cash Money and Butterfly. Later, we ran into Mary Poppins whom we hadn’t seen since Hopewell Junction, NY. A little farther on, we found McDuck, the Okie and JFK. It was beginning to feel like Grand Central Station!
Aside from seeing all the familiar faces, we enjoyed the walk through the forest, even the ever present rocks, mud and roots. Occasionally, the trail would take us out of the forest onto a ledge where we could see the tree covered mountains rolling away from us like giant waves. The view is always predictable and somehow different at the same time. 
We walked close to Mt Abraham (or Mt Abrams as we were told the locals all it), then up Mt. Spaulding (4010 feet) before beginning the descent to Caribou Valley Road, gently at first, then back to the very steep rock climbing we had hoped we’d left behind. Eventually, we crossed the fast flowing South Branch of the Carrabassett River just before reaching Caribou Valley Road and meeting up with Rich (he walks faster than us) at about 2:30 p.m. 
About a half hour later McDuck, the Okie and JFK showed up for the same shuttle we were awaiting. They are staying at the Roadhouse (at the motel, as we did the first night, because the Roadhouse is full) and they also want to shuttle to do the Bigelows tomorrow so we coordinated with them to arrange a 6:15 a.m. shuttle.
Today’s highlight was walking over the 2000 mile mark. There was apparently a marker, but we missed it! None the less, we are feeling very pleased with ourselves to have come this far!
Back at the Roadhouse, Sour Patch and Burrito had showed up with Covid. Fortunately, the Jens were on top of the situation, isolating the two of them at the motel. In the meantime, we are back to wearing masks…we spent quite a bit of time with Burrito at the Cabin where she did work for stay. Kerry is not happy about this; he has a susceptibility to lung issues due to a very bad pneumonia he had as a young man.
And to top it all off, Tuesday, the day we should be leaving here and heading for Monson is forecast for inches of rain again! As a result, we are now considering staying here another day to wait it out. On the bright side, although I tripped several times today, I didn’t fall once!…and so it goes…","Old Railroad Road 1991.3

We woke up at 5:30 a.m. and I looked out the window at rows of white clouds laced in a lighted rose color along their bottom edges and I remembered the old adage: “red sky in the morning, shepherd’s warning,” a forewarning of another approaching storm?
Today, we hiked southbound from East Flagstaff Road to ME 27 where we ended yesterday. We decided to go this direction because it was more than an hour drive to get to East Flagstaff Road, a drive we didn’t want to make at the end of a long day. It turned out to be a good decision because instead of ending our day hiking two mountains, we started with them. These, the Bigelows, are supposed to be the last “difficult” mountains before Katahdin. We’ve heard that line before so we remain skeptical, but if true, we would be very happy.
At first it was a gradual climb up to Little Bigelow Peak, but became more steep as we ascended to Avery Peak, where we had lunch while looking out in all directions at the rolling tree-covered mountains spattered with large bodies of water—they looked larger than lakes and they appeared to be full of islands. It was not a clear day, the sky was hazy with smoke from fires in Canada and we had a high cloud cover. We weren’t sure if the haze was from the Canadian fires or a harbinger of the coming storm, but it affected what we could see and how we saw it.
Then it was on to Bigelow West Peak, a 4145 foot peak with a sharp conical top that we walked up and over, then on to South Horn and finally a long and sometimes steep and difficult descent back to the road. All day, the sky grew gloomier and finally started spitting rain at us as as we reached ME 27. Tomorrow, it is forecast to rain most of the day, so we, and gazillion other hikers have elected to take (yet another) zero day to stay dry.
At ME 27, we missed the shuttle and two nice men, father and son from Georgia and New York respectively, shared a beer with us and let us sit in their van while we awaited Jen, from the Maine Roadhouse Hostel, to come and pick us up.  Both were called, Kris; the dad a retired engineer has section hiked the PCT all the way from Georgia, and  his son, Kris, a mathematics  professor at a university, comes with him to make sure he is OK. They were very nice, good-humored and interesting people. It’s always a good day when you meet kind people.
Eventually, Jen showed up in the school bus to pick us up, its only occupants. As she drove down the road, she suddenly exclaimed, “Do you want to see a moose?” to which she received two enthusiastic yesses. She then performed an amazing u-turn with the bus and took us to where a bunch of people were looking at a lone moose cow standing in a meadow. She was wet and her fur looked almost black in the rain.  This was the first, and probably only moose we have seen/will see on the AT. We were very pleased! Afterwards, Jen returned us to the hostel, now filled with hikers fleeing the rain. Acorn and Uncle Sam showed up too, we haven’t seen them since Bethel, maybe a week ago. Also Oatie, Garfield and Cash Money and ….the list goes on!

What a day! After the rain, the trail was mostly a river, we even had cascading waterfalls on it. Kerry thought we should wear our neoprene socks today because he said our feet would get wet. Well, he was right about that. It took me all of five minutes to slide off a wet board and into the bog, and Kerry uncharacteristically fell 3 times during the day. The mud was everywhere and impossible to avoid, and we didn’t. We had to ford several streams which was good as it gave us the opportunity to divest ourselves of some of the mud.
We were told that after the Bigelows, the terrain would be gentler until we reach Katahdin and this was certainly true today. We walked up and down gentle inclines and around several large ponds that looked more like large lakes or inland seas. The wind was blowing briskly and the lakes had white caps and waves lapping at their shores. This kept the insects away and cooled us all day. 
We thought today would be easier but it was really hard work focusing our attention 
on stepping on tree roots and rocks to avoid falling in the water or the mud. Inevitably, we occasionally fell in the mud or water anyway and eventually, I at least, gave up trying to keep my feet out of the mud.
One thing I was thinking about today, is the lack of bird song. For the last few weeks we’ve heard very few birds, especially in the morning. I wonder if they’ve travelled elsewhere to get away from the bad weather. That said, we did hear loons, now that it’s sunset, calling on the lake.
We came to the shelter and it looks straight out at the “pond” through the trees so we rinsed our socks and our feet and now I am sitting watching the clouds, laced in gray, floating by whilst the sun lights the undulating water. It’s so peaceful here. The hostels we’ve been staying in have been great, but it’s good to be back on the trail.

We had 3.7 miles to the Kennebec River, where the ferry only runs from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. so there was no point in rushing this morning.  Harrison’s Sport Camp, .3 miles away, has a pancake breakfast that is supposed to be very good but one must walk over there the day before to make a reservation. Needless to say, after a long day of walking, no one wants to do that. So, Orion, Carjack and we all walked over in the morning to see if they might at least sell us a cup of coffee, but we found the place shut up tight and no one was around. We chose to go this way anyway (toward the fish camp) because the water is very high and Harrison’s has bridges over the dicey bits, for which we were very grateful.
The four of us, and Felix walked the 3.7 miles to the Kennebec River together. A lot of it was by the side of the Pierce Pond Outlet stream, which was crashing down the mountainside and flooded over it’s bank in places. There is still a lot of mud and it is still difficult walking on the trail.
We arrived at the river at 8:45 AM and there were five people awaiting the ferry ahead of us. The ferry operator was only taking one person at a time initially as the water was unusually high and the current was very strong. By the time he got to Kerry and I, he decided to take the two of us together with Felix. It was quite a ride! I sat in the middle with Felix, whilst Kerry had to paddle as fast as he could to help the ferryman take us across. 
By now it was after 10 AM so we were unsure how far we might get today, but decided we would just go as far as we could. We are both getting pretty skilled at root and rock hopping to avoid falling in the mud. Sometimes we miss, but mostly we don’t, and no falls today! The main issue for us is that it slows us down…it’s exhausting and not your typical walk in the park.
The last 6 miles entailed walking over Pleasant Pond Mountain and Middle Mountain, neither of which are very high, but in typical AT fashion they require one to walk vertically straight up the side and then down the other side before tackling the next vertical climb; all of this in mud!
After having plenty of water all day, we had none once we started up the mountains, and this determined our stopping place for the night, near a little creek that is probably a seasonal run off. The water is clear and we found a flat spot covered in dead leaves near by. We’re happy to be back in the tent and I think we’ll sleep better for it, even if the predicted rain comes! Oh well, nothing new there!

As predicted last night, it rained, but it didn’t just rain, it poured again in a steady, hard rain from midnight until about 5:30 this morning. It rained so much and so hard that the ground could not immediately absorb the water. Consequently, the ground around us flooded and by morning we had an inch of water at the bottom of the tent and our down sleeping bags were soaked. Kerry was sleeping deeply, so I rolled over and let him sleep. When we final got up, there was but one thing to do, pack up and move on. It took us awhile but with soaked and with heavy water-laden backpacks we were back on the trail by about 6:45 a.m.
Within a mile, we came to our first challenging stream crossing, the inlet to Moxie Pond. I don’t know if a stronger person than Kerry and I could have made it across, but the water was running high and very fast and after last night’s rain it was even higher and faster. We decided to take our first ATC recommended detour of the day and walk down the road to a bridge, this added some unofficial mileage to the day but we were both happy to not risk our lives so early in the day.
After that, predictably, the mud was worse and the water once again was cascading down the trail in lots of places. We forded several streams including one fast one that came up to our thighs. That one was particularly scary for Felix. I took the crossing first, leaving my pack on the other side, then came back across to help Felix whom Kerry had by the scruff of the neck to prevent him from being swept down stream. The current was very fast and keeping one’s balance while helping a frightened canine was not easy. Kerry handed Felix off to me and we all made it to the far shore. Felix was happy, for sure!
We had met three southbounders during the day who told us how dangerously high the East Branch of the Piscataquis River is. Two young people said the current was very strong and the water higher than their waists. The third person told us about yet another ATC sanctioned detour to avoid it. There was a younger couple ahead of us who also decided to take the detour, which we will also take tomorrow, unfortunately adding more miles to our day.
Kerry fell again, when his foot slipped on one of those wet slippery rocks, There is nothing more uncomfortable than a wet muddy butt after a fall, I think it maybe worse than the actual pain caused by the fall.
One good thing was that when we reached the summit of Moxie Bald, we had some lovely views but even better, there was a very strong wind and unbelievably, in about an hour we had dried out our sleeping bags, the tent and most of our clothes, it really helped lift our spirits: we didn’t know how we were going to sleep with everything soaked.
We saw lots of small brown toads, and lots of moose droppings. We ate the plentiful bog berries and for the first time near the trail I saw lots of pink fireweed.
Tomorrow, we hope to head into Monson, we’ve run out of food so we are highly motivated to get there as fast as we can!

A bit of a slow start this morning but it didn’t rain last night and we both slept well in our dried out sleeping bags. We had a more than 7 mile (mostly forest service) logging road walk to cross a bridge over the East Branch Piscataquis (pronounced, “piss-cat-a-kiss”) River that was running too fast and high to safely ford and return to the Appalachian Trail. Ordinarily, we don’t like road walks but we were positively happy to do this one today. The road was puddle-less, mudless, rootless and  rock-less, and we just walked and enjoyed the wildflowers and the scenery whilst walking at a good pace. We had almost forgotten how enjoyable this could be. Once we returned to the AT (mud, roots and rocks) we slowed down again, but we got to ME Route 6/15 at 12:30 so much faster than we’ve been going. We had missed the noon Hostel shuttle, so we hitch-hiked in to town courtesy of Chris, a kind man in an old pickup on his way to town.
There isn’t a lot in Monson but we were able to have a good lunch, followed by a great (in my case) chocolate milkshake, and in Kerry’s, a strawberry milkshake. We put together a very expensive re-supply from the available sources (a convenience store, the General Store and Shaw’s Hiker Hostel, where we are staying). This will be our last re-supply, I hope, on our final 115 miles to Katahdin.
We had dinner at the Lakehouse Pub, outside at a table overlooking yet another lovely lake. I am impressed with the abundance of waterways in Maine…the entire state is riddled with them, like a giant Swiss cheese. .
Tomorrow, no surprise, it’s supposed to pour rain again, so we are probably going to slack pack the next 15 miles just to keep moving forward. We’ll have to move to the Lakehouse Pub and Hotel tomorrow night, as predictably, Shaw’s is all booked up due to the rain. The walk tomorrow includes a five mile road walk to bypass high water at Little and Big Wilson Rivrrs as well as Long Pond.","Tent site at 2070.7

It rained hard again last night and we awoke to a foggy morning and a forecast of rain for later in the day. Shaw’s breakfast was great: eggs, potatoes, bacon and blueberry pancakes, just what a hiker needs to get going!
After breakfast, Rich, Kerry, Felix and I piled into a truck with our driver, Long Shot, for a drive that would put us on a detour around the Wilson Rivers that I described yesterday. We began with the five mile road walk, which didn’t seem that long, probably due to the lack of “mud-stacles.” In fact, even with a half hour or so for lunch, we were back at ME 15 by 3 p.m, in about 6 hours, so I plan to check the mileage tomorrow….I don’t think we walked 15 miles in 6 hours!
After the road walk and crossing the bridge over the river, I think it was the Little Wilson River, we walked up another road beside it until it turned into a trail and then we walked up that path beside the river until we reached one of the problematic AT crossings. I don’t think we could have crossed it, and all the hikers we met coming north bound were planning to take the detour, but I’m betting someone will try to cross. We were happy with our choice to detour. 
The forest was rich with tall evergreen trees, and the ground was mostly covered with moss and pine needles. To me, it had the feel of an old forest where magical creatures might live. To support my feeling, I couldn’t help but notice the plethora of toadstools all around us that would make lovely homes for any of those creatures! 
Speaking of toadstools, we’ve been seeing a lot of good sized toads (I wonder if they’re disguising any princes….sorry, I can’t help myself!). Google thinks the one I saw today is a Fowler Toad, but some have been plain old American Toads.
About 2 p.m. and 2 miles out from our pick up point, it started to rain gently. At first, it was so gentle we barely felt a few drops through the trees, but when we looked out across Leeman Pond, we could see the rain dropping on the water creating a steady show of splashes where it hit. We were hoping the downpour would hold off until we reached the road and mostly it did, but we knew it was coming. This time, hitchhiking was easier; a young couple, Daniel and Justine picked us up almost right away and brought us into Monson.
First stop: a milkshake at the ice cream shop and then on to Shaw’s to pay our bill and pick up our packs before heading over to the Lakeshore Pub for the night. By now, we had a good rain coming down, so we were happy to be under cover. Once again, we saw lots of hikers converging on the hostel…as we close in on the last 100 miles I suppose this is to be expected. 
Tomorrow, we will continue through the 100 Mile Wilderness, and I may be off line now until Katahdin. I’m praying the weather is kinder for a few days, we could use a break!","ME Route 15 (Monson) 2083.7

We had breakfast sandwiches and coffee at the General Store before heading back to Shaw’s where Kerry bought his fifth pair of new shoes: some lone peak altras. Poet (who owns the hostel with his wife, Hippy Chick) drove us, Rich and 2 women back to the road we started on yesterday, Before leaving us there he said a haiku poem he had written and took our photos.
Kerry and I weighed our packs before we left the Lakeshore Lodge and with extra food for us and the dog, his weighed 34 lbs and mine surprised me at 33 lbs. I have not weighed my bag before; I didn’t want to know how heavy it was but I think this must be the heaviest so far.
At the drop off point, we said, “goodbye” to Rich before he took off with his usual speed, then Kerry and I immediately started our negotiations with the mud, which we eventually lost. There was too much of it to avoid ad eventually we each had two wet muddy feet.
We climbed several mountains (Barren, 3 Chairback mountains and Columbia mountain), a fairly strenuous day but it was the mud, roots and slippery wet rocks that continued to challenge us. The forest was easy on the eyes and every once in a while we’d come out on the ledges to lovely views (yes, the usual tree-covered mountains). Someone told us we would get our.kfirst glimpse of Katahdin today, and we probably did, but neither of us knew what we were looking at.
On top of one of those mountains, we encountered the small plane crash that Wendy at the ATC told us about. It happened a couple of years ago and the father and young son that got into foggy weather which caused the crash, apparently we’re able to camp that night on the mountain and walk out the next day. I suppose in a way it was fortunate for them that they crashed practically on the AT.
We made slow progress today, Kerry had a couple of falls on those slippery roots and that made him more cautious and we decided to stop at the Chairback Gap Lean-to, but when we arrived, there were already 4 people spread out who didn’t seem interested in making room for us so we decided to move on. Sandman, who we haven’t seen in weeks, was there but he too was oddly reticient.
The first place we came to that wasn’t wet and where we could squeeze our tent in was atop Chairback Mountain. The wind was blowing hard…a little night music to go to sleep to and the sunset was glorious…we’ve seen far too few of those!
It’s good to be back in our tent, alone again, the way we like it!

The alarm went off at 5 a.m. I thought I set it earlier but we both slept well and probably benefitted from the extra sleep. Even though the wind blew much of the night, the inside and outside of the tent was unexpectedly wet this morning, so we had to put the tent away damp. We had some fresh berries for breakfast though,,,,bog berries all around us!
Like last night we had a glorious sunrise and of course, we had a view across the valleys and the more distant mountains. It was slow going climbing over rockfalls etc to get to The West Branch of the Pleasant River, one of the potential problematic crossings that turned out to be no problem at all. The water came to just below our knees so we got some of the mud off our pants and shoes. Even Felix was able to walk across and he got cleaned up too!
After that the trail was remarkably level for awhile although I had a bad fall when I tripped on a root whilst watching someone coming toward me instead of the ground, Around noon, Rich and Andrea passed us and he told us that it was 10:30 p.m. before he returned to the hostel yesterday, because the other hiker being shuttled was late and did not go to designated pick up point. Anyway, they are camped nearby tonight. Kerry and I chose to stay in the shelter because we are tired and our tent is wet.
In the afternoon, we climbed four mountains including White Cap, which we are told is the last big mountain before Katahdin. I don’t mind climbing mountains, it tends to keep us out of the mud.
It’s dark now and everyone around me is asleep so it’s time for me to go too!

I awoke to a mouse rustling my small trash bag.. I shone my telephone on him and found him unexpectedly cute. He looked at me, and the at the trash bag and was gone in a flash. After that I went back to sleep and it was after 5 before I knew it. The colorless twilight brightened fairly quickly and we could see blue sky overhead, a potential good sign for the day.
Unlike yesterday, the path started gently downhill following the Brook. We still had mud, rocks and roots but not all or even most of the time. For the most part the trail actually looked like a trail that was meant to be walked on for a change. This made hiking much easier and faster. Kerry and I both felt very sleepy the first part of the day and we think it may bel because of all the caffeine we’ve been drinking whilst at hostels and in towns. Our energy improved considerably after lunch and we made better progress.
We only climbed one mountain today, I think, Little Boardman at 2009 feet, which was pretty easy by comparison to most of the mountains we’ve encountered. We had lots of toads run across the path and the mushrooms were a mycologist’s dream. There were so many varieties that I couldn’t begin to count them all, never mind identify them. So many different colors and shapes, it was amazing. 
We have been noticing some bright red leaves on the ground over the last few days. At first we thought it must be from a different kind of tree, but then realized that a few of the leaves must be turning. We saw some bright orange ones and yellow ones too; very pretty and out of place in the deep green forest.
We walked by several “ponds”, I wonder if that’s a local reference because where I come from they would definitely be called lakes, and big ones at that. We had wet feet again all day as we had to ford the infamous East Branch of the Pleasant River which turned out to be neither deep nor dangerous  at least today. Not withstanding, I managed to fall in but Mr. Friendly and his friend, Full Send came along and gave us a hand by taking Felix’s pack across and guiding me to the shallower path. We had a nice chat with them. Mr. Friendly is a golf coach who was living in Chicago but has come home to Maine to start his own golf business. He told us he caught trout last night in the river for his dinner. I wish I had been here!
At some point, Jukebox passed us. He had been walking with his dog Luna, but he told us he had to take her off trail at Mt. Washington; she had been having trouble with her paws that had become raw in places and bloody. We were sorry to hear this but I’m sure he made the right decision for the dog.
Tonight, we’re in a lovely spot on Jo Mary Pond, looking out at the water and listening to what we thought were loons calling. Car Jack told Kerry they can sound a bit like wolves, and these birds certainly do. We’re sitting in our tent listening to the rain gently fall on us, trying to organize our gear so it doesn’t get wet if the rain gets heavier. We’ve come to the conclusion that a larger tent may be needed, A lot of people we know use this tent for a single person and we’ve crammed in two people and a dog…it’s very cosy!

A relatively short day today. The rain is coming and we thought it wise to stop in a shelter so we could at least get up dry. Also, we’re looking for better weather to summit Katahdin which means we may have to delay a day or two. Right now, Sunday and Monday look like the best days, with rain all day tomorrow (Friday) and some improvement Saturday. The walk today, though relatively flat was tough, riddled with roots, we had to pay attention all the time and it was tiring. Tex, one of Mr. Friendly’s young cohorts said the same thing.
A ton of mushrooms again, in every size, shape and color imaginable and we saw more yellow and red leaves on the ground so even though the forest is very green, it’s not hard to imagine that fall is coming. We passed more enormous ponds but we only saw a few people on the short sandy beaches. Even though these ponds are popular, I think they are very remote and not so easy to get to.
I haven’t mentioned the little flies and mosquitoes that take great pleasure flying into my eyes, It’s very painful and nasty and if they catch me mid step, they can upset my balance and send me tumbling. At least Kerry doesn’t have this problem because he wears glasses. His problem is seeing through them when they fog up due to high humidity.
Felix has been chasing squirrels up trees and I’m afraid it’s made him more feral and protective. We are having to reign him in around new people again, just when I thought he was getting better. He has even growled when Kerry approaches after walking off to get water etc. 
We feel very sleepy again today, so maybe we’ll use the early stop to rest up. At this point, we just like a little sunshine to end on. Truthfully, we’d settle for dry, but the weather doest n’t negotiate and in the end we just have to deal with it.

It didn’t rain last night so we could have walked farther yesterday. On the other hand, we had 11 1/2 hours of lying down time, most of it asleep and we both woke up with lots of energy which is why we made the mistake of walking into the heavy rain.
The rain started at about 6 a.m…..a drizzle at first, in fact the drizzle kept going most of the day, but it was light enough that it wasn’t uncomfortable to walk in.
We met a photographer called CW, he hiked the AT a few years ago. We also saw Chance, the FEMA guy who is riding his bike and driving his truck in approximately 300 mile sections to self support his hike. We’ve crossed paths with him as many as a half a dozen times since we first met him at Woods Hole Hostel in Virginia (?). Today we exchanged contact information in case he comes to California to hike the PCT.
Early in the day, Major, Husband and Blues Clues passed us, as did Steel and a group of four young people we’ve been seeing the last couple of days. Everyone passed us today and consequently when we reached the shelter there was no room for us, which we sort of planned on. What we didn’t plan on was the rain getting heavy around 3 o’clock so by the time we arrived at the shelter, sodden and tired, we found the ground sodden too. We found a small patch that looked to be draining o.k., put the tent up, threw our wet clothes in a plastic bag and dived into the tent as fast as we could. Poor Felix has to sleep outside, soaked as he is.
We have 18.5 miles to go to the summit of Katahdin. Tomorrow, if we are not too wet and uncomfortable, we’ll keep going. If the rain continues we’ll probably try to get to Millinocket, 18 miles away, to see if we can get a little decent weather for our final climb. If you detect some discouragement here, we do feel a little so, so close to the end  of our journey. It just feels like such a slog on days like today.
We walked by some beautiful lakes shrouded in fog and several signs pointing to views of Katahdin, which was nowhere to be seen. The big highlight of the day was this morning as we were walking down the trail when Felix let out a low growl and Kerry thinking it was an approaching hiker turned around to see a huge moose with a full rack standing in the trail not 25 feet away. Felix tried to take off after him, but leashed to me just managed to pull me over on my left arm, exactly where I fell 2 days ago. Felix has grown stronger, or I’m weaker, or a combination of the two. He didn’t used to be strong enough to pull me over. We managed to get a few photos…the moose was a truly majestic looking animal.
Meanwhile, it’s dark now and the rain seems to be getting stronger and once again we’re getting water inside the tent. Still not sure why. I am tired, it was a long day and I’m just hoping we don’t awaken in a puddle again.","Wadleigh Stream Lean-to 2160.2

Almost a Nero today. We arrived at the ranger station at about 8:30 a.m. only to find every available campsite on the mountain taken. After we got over our disappointment at delaying our ascent a whole day, we rented space in the Abol Pines Bunkhouse and settled in for the day.
Last night, it rained off and on into the night but we managed to stay reasonably dry. This morning, Kerry put his (wringing) wet clothes back on, something I couldn’t bear to do. So I braved the mosquitoes and put on my Walmart shorts (complete with butterflies) and the New York Marathon shirt given to me by Charlotte Grove back in New York, I must have looked quite a sight! 
After all the rain, the sun was shining brightly this morning and we had blue skies until about noon, when again the clouds came in. It’s hard to predict what the weather is going to do from looking at it here, and the actual weather forecast is only a little more accurate some of the time. 
We’ve been so hammered by the rain, mud, rocks and roots that I haven’t thought to comment on how great the scenery would be under more ideal circumstances. For example, today, the forest has a lovely green mossy floor under evergreen trees spaced far enough apart to let the light in. In fact, it’s been mostly like that since we went over White Cap. If it weren’t for the mud, roots and rocks it would be an ideal walk…not so mmuch uphill as to be onerous etc.
Here at Abol Pines Campground, we have spent quite a lot of money buying food at the general store; happy to help the local economy. We both had nice hot showers and have washed clothes, unexpected pleasures we thought we wouldn’t have until the end of the hike. Due to lack of internet, we have been unable to reach Time and a Half and No Complaints to take them up on their kind offer to allow us to stay at their group campsite tomorrow night. We’ll keep trying.
It started raining at about 3 p.m. and continued off and on until 6 p.m. we were concerned that we might have a repeat of yesterday but fortunately it wasn’t. The rain slacked off but we were happy to be inside our cabin, with our gear dried out and ready for our final night on the trail tomorrow.
A lot of people we have met plan to summit on Monday; besides Time and a Half and No Complaints, McDuck, the Okie and JFK walked in to Abol Pines this evening,,kk so it will be quite the crowd!
It’s dark now, lots of things going through my head that I can’t quite put my finger on. It’s odd after all these months to think about this particular adventure coming to an end. I’m ready to go home and yet I think it will be jarring after all this time. Oh well, I will know soon enough!","Hurd Brook Lean-to 2179.8

I woke up 5 a.m. and I couldn’t go back to sleep. Kerry decided not to hot foot it down to the ranger’s kiosk to get a reservation for the Birches AT hiker designated campground. He thought we could find Time and a Half and No Complaints at their group site at Katahdin Stream. I saw McDuck and friends go by at about 5:30 a.m. and asked McDuck if he would take our cards. This turned out to be an exercise in futility since the ranger requires one to be present to reserve a spot at the Birches campsite. Consequently, when I found this out at 7:15 a.m. Kerry and I walked the half mile to the kiosk and secured places 8 and 9 of 12. As it turned out, we never did find Time and a Half and No Complaints so it’s a good job we had the reservation at the Birches. 
The walk from Abol Pines was very easy, through the woods, mostly beside a lovely river that was alternately wide and calm and crashing down water slides. The sunlight filtered through the trees creating lovely puddles of light on the rich green moss that covered the ground under the trees. It must be very wet here even when it’s not rainy.
It was early afternoon when we arrived at the ranger station to register. He was not in so we walked on to the campground where predictably all the shelter spaces had been taken. Fortunately, there was a tent platform so we didn’t have to set up in the mud.
Clare and James were there, we haven’t seen them, I think, since Pinkham Notch. Blues Clues and Major, who passed us earlier were also there and McDuck and friends and his son, Nathan from Carlsbad, California. Hot Lips and Caveman came by before moving on. They claimed to have hiked 160 miles in 5 days, pretty amazing but especially so since they are probably not a lot younger than us!
We managed to while away our final afternoon just visiting people before ranger Pete came by to give us our completion cards and some final instructions about respecting the trail and the people on it. He was very nice and after he left he turned around and came back to give Felix a completion card too. I don’t think I realized what it was until he did that and I liked him all the more for doing it. He said, “he walked the trail too.”
Well, tomorrow is a big day for us: a more than 4,000 foot climb (some of it a class 3 rock climb, according to ranger Pete) mostly in a 3 mile stretch and once we reach the top, we have to descend 5 miles down.

It’s 9:30 p.m., way past hiker midnight, but I don’t care because I’m no longer on the trail. Tomorrow, I don’t have to think about the miles to hike, the mud to slog through or the roots and rocks to slip on, trip over or otherwise cause me harm! It’s quite liberating. 
Today, we arose at 4:30 a.m. and two months past the summer solstice, it was noticeably dark until we got going at 5:30 a.m., another reminder that the days are growing shorter and the fall is coming. We were back on the trail at 6 AM and walked the 5.3 miles to Baxter Peak in 4 1/2 hours which is not a bad time for a more than 4,000 foot climb! Most of the climb was in a two mile vertical stretch which included some class 3 scary climbing. We had emptied Felix’s pack but put it on him incase we had to carry him ( it has a handle on top of the pack). We did lift him in a couple of places, but mostly he was just fine: Felix the dog, the wonderful, wonderful dog!
Ranger Pete had explained to us last night that the weather pattern in this vicinity at this time of year includes a lot of moisture/rain especially early in the day…toward noon, if the weather is forecast to be good, the skies clear. This is exactly what happened today. We went up the mountain in heavy fog and high winds and as we rose above the tree line into the vertical section of the “trail” (yes, that’s a joke!), the winds became so strong, I had trouble maintaining my balance and I was very concerned about Felix being blown off the rocks.  It was then that we had a rebar handle set in the rock to help us up the granite and iron holds to hang onto to pull us up some of the vertical faces. I was pretty close to terrified and all I could think was, I have to go on. It was like being in one of those epic adventure movies where everything comes apart and someone ends up dead before the “happy” ending.
We met Hot Lips at this point, she and her husband are hoping to complete the triple crown this year. She was so terrified at half way up the mountain, that she decided to go back down the mountain (no easy feat) and return another day. We clambered on. McDuck and friends passed us. McDuck and his son helped us a little and I actually located the trail for them that they seemed to have briefly lost. But they were on a mission and soon disappeared into the mists. We saw them later on the summit and exchanged mutual congratulations; they remembered that our paths first crossed about 1800 miles ago.
We kept going, one foot in front of the next, all the time knowing we had less than three miles to go to the end of the trail. It was steep, impossibly difficult, cold and windy, but we persevered and eventually, we reached the “plateau,” an enormous plain near the top of the mountain that one must traverse before the final steep, but not vertical, ascent of Baxter Peak, the highest point on Mt. Katahdin. This was a great relief, because we were back to rock hopping the ubiquitous puddles, whilst being whipped around by the wind. Visibility was about 15 feet so we had no idea of the majesty around us. That would come later, when the skies finally cleared for our descent.
Upon reaching the top, a young man by the name of Josh, a day hiker took the obligatory photos of us on the Mt Katahdin sign, which Kerry and I both think is tacky and should be replaced with something more classy for the situation. After that, we sat down to eat. I wasn’t hungry but Kerry is always hungry these days, he’s quietly starving so it’s a good job we’re going home to find some of that weight he lost. A young man by the name of Everett/Booty Juice came over talk to us and wanted to pet Felix, who wanted none of that.
After sitting there about 1/2 an hour, the mist began to clear and after we were there about an hour, and were ready to move on, the skies blued up and we had spectacular views all around for our difficult, steep descent down the Abol Trail, basically a 4000 foot descent of a rock/boulder fall. But our long journey was over. Early in the trek, we had read on a sign that upon hiking the entire trail, one has climbed t0he equivalent of Mount Everest 16 times. I couldn’t conceive that at the time, but now I find it totally believable.
We had arranged for Gail, who owns the 100 Mile Wilderness Inn to pick us up and take us into Millinocket with Matt/""Tapeworm"" and Rachel/""Riot"" who shared the tent platform with us last night. We are coordinating with them on transportation to Portland, ME for our air transport home. In the meantime, Kerry and I ordered a pizza that we took to the local tavern, with the owner’s blessing in order to eat with a celebratory drink, me with 2 Bombay Sapphire martinis and Kerry with beer. Tapeworm and Riot joined us and so did a brand new south bounder, Colton.
Felix stayed at the Inn and slept, amazing dog. This hike has changed him; physically he looks like a working border collie, all muscle and strength and he has become completely attached to us in the way dogs do with their pack. He is really special.
I haven’t had time to digest the end of this hike yet. I will have something to say later. Right now, it’s  hard to wrap my head around the fact that Kerry and I just spent 5 1/2 months wandering around in the woods after 50 years of marriage (anniversary Friday, August 25). Who knows where the time goes?
“Across the evening sky, all the birds are leavingBut how can they know it's time for them to go?Before the winter fire, I will still be dreamingI have no thought of timeFor who knows where the time goes?Who knows where the time goes?Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leavingAh, but then you know it's time for them to goBut I will still be here, I have no thought of leavingI do not count the timeFor who knows where the time goes?Who knows where the time goes?And I am not alone while my love is near meI know it will be so until it's time to goSo come the storms of winter and then the birds in spring againI have no fear of timeFor who knows how my love grows?And who knows where the time goes?”--Sandy Denny

"Jo, Kerry & Felix",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668541,"It’s been a week since we returned home and my feet have still not landed on the ground. Kerry, Felix and I have been sitting around eating, drinking and sleeping and not much else. 
Kerry and I lost 50 lbs between us, mostly in the first month, then we seemed to stabilize, or at least we were eating enough at that point to maintain our weight. Felix, on the other hand, gained 2 lbs, all muscle, as far as I can tell. Already a very healthy dog, he just got a little brawnier and a lot stronger. We need a rest, but Felix is ready to keep going.
I don’t know what I expected when we started this journey. We made no plans other than to buy our plane tickets, Oakland to Atlanta, Georgia, via Denver. We had no expectations, we just thought we would keep walking as long as we were enjoying ourselves. In the end, we kept going even when the going got rough, first with the rain and then the terrain. I remember early on listening to some young people talking at a shelter about their hike expectations. For us, it was always just another walk, a new journey. 
One of the things that surprised me was that we literally walked through mostly contiguous forest for more than two thousand miles. I don’t know what I expected. I thought the land would change over such a long distance, as it did, sometimes dramatically, on the other long trails we have hiked, but the one constant was the unending and glorious forest. Even when we had “views” from mountain tops and ledges, we looked out on more forests, it was quite daunting. 
We walked through or near many small towns, villages really, and I did not expect this. I have always thought of the East Coast as more urban, which I’m sure is also true. I just did not expect to see so much country. That probably sounds ridiculous,  but for me it was very enlightening. It gave us a feel for how people live and their values.
One of the wonderful things about the Appalachian Trail is its connectedness to communities both on and off the trail. It made it possible for us to travel without a plan, to stop when we wanted to, to buy food, get out of the rain or just take a rest day. We met many wonderful and kind people. People who had no reason to help us or even just be nice, it reinforced my belief that most people are decent. I also learned that the trail has room for the not so nice people…if they are not good people in their off-trail life, the trail sadly, will not change that.
Most of the hostels and many of the motels we stayed at were run by people who put their hearts and souls into their work, they went above and beyond the business, and even though we only knew them for a day and sometimes two, they treated us as valued friends. The difference between these “homes” and those for whom it was just a business was immediately noticeable. I’m still processing this. I suppose it’s like the difference between those who truly love their work and those who are just in it for the money. Don’t misunderstand me, they all have a right to make a good living, but attitude makes a difference.
There were so many people who provided trail magic in the form of food. I now see that all those hot dogs and hamburgers we ate in the southern states must have made a big difference to mitigating our weight issue in the early days. I have no idea how we would have managed without it. As much as the food, their conversations and stories really added to our journey….I’m looking forward to re-reading my journal and re-visiting those stories. People we will never see again, but whose lives touched ours for a time.
There is a special place in heaven for all those people that helped us in other ways too, I don’t want to call them out here, there were many and I don’t want to miss someone, but when a perfect stranger takes you home with them or gives you a ride or helps just because they can see you need it, it touches you deeply. There were other hikers who helped us from time to time as well, who helped when we needed to lift Felix over a boulder or who gave us a place to tent in the rain. I find myself wondering would I do the same thing if circumstances were reversed? I like to think so, but I have to admit I had not given it much thought. 
Kerry and I have been mulling over the question, had we known at the beginning how difficult the terrain would get in New Hampshire and Maine, would we have attempted it? We’re not sure, it’s probably irrelevant since we didn’t know and we’ve now hiked it. We are a little proud of ourselves…we had not planned on literally rock-climbing up mountains, which just goes to show that sometimes a leap of faith is a good thing. 
On that note, I’ll end my reflections for now. Thank you for sharing our journey and be sure to look us up if you make it to Oakland, California. We plan to stay home for a while!",,View Entry,"Aug 31, Thu",0
