Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659643,"I can't tell you how many hikers, friends and family have asked me when or if I am going to hike the Appalachian Trail (AT) and get my Triple Crown.  Even Mrs. Haze commented a few years ago that I should hike the AT before I get too old.  My response has always been that I had too many hikes left to do in the wild West, and besides, I enjoy solitude and hiking in more remote, wide-open settings.  So what has changed?  Nothing really, however, I do have a few less long hikes to do in the West and it is definitely a fact that I am older.  I just came to realize during and since my Colorado Trail hike this past summer that I would be denying myself a tremendous new challenge, a new environment and an opportunity to continue to learn and grow.
So Springer Mountain here I come!  My flight is booked and I've put together a rough schedule.  Most of my gear is in pretty good shape but I still have lots of work to do.  As usual, I can't wait!",,View Entry,"Dec 30, Fri",0
Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659644,"The first thing I really have to learn is the proper pronunciation of the Appalachian Trail - kind of like the "" Apple.at'.chan"" Trail - glad I sorted that out before I embarrassed myself - I am sure there will be more opportunities to do that!
The AT, completed in 1937 and conceived by Benton MacKaye, a forester, extends along the spine of the Appalachian Mountains almost 2,200 miles from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin (mouwnt kuh.taa'.dn) in Maine, passing through 14 states, six national parks, eight national forests and 67 state-owned land areas.  The highest point is Clingman's Dome, 6,643ft, in North Carolina, and the lowest point is Bear Mountain State Park, 124ft, in New York.  I am especially looking forward to the Grayson Highlands (VA), Great Smoky Mountains, Shenandoah National Park, and Maine.  I was a bit surprised to learn that the AT has more elevation change, over 420,000 ft, than the longer PCT.  Tougher than the PCT and the CDT?  We'll see! 
At least initially, this will be a busier trail than most, and much more than what I am used to, maybe dated but an estimated 3,000 attempts, about 25% of which succeed.",,View Entry,"Dec 30, Fri",0
Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659671,"I've hiked in cold and wet weather but not for an extended period and usually not that combination at the same time.  I'm kind of a desert guy that doesn't even like the cold all that much.  I have been caught and drenched in rain, hail and thunderstorms, been hypothermic or close to it a few times in Colorado and Utah and understand the importance of having a dry set of clothes and dry sleeping bag.  My limited research confirms March to be potentially, maybe even typically cold and wet.  So what am I going to do differently?  First of all, a warmer base layer - just got a Smartwool Thermal Merino ""intraknit"" base layer that hopefully will help until it warms up a bit.  
Once my feet and hands get cold, it takes them forever to warm up.  I hate to say it, but it has gotten worse with age.  I usually bring ultralight gloves that don't offer much protection.  I broke down and got myself a few early Xmas presents - possum gloves and a pair of ZPacks goose socks.
I haven't brought rain pants on a hike for over 10 years finding them too hot and then only using them on zero days while washing clothes.  Well, I probably need to be more prepared and am looking at the Montbell versalite rain pants and maybe some vertice rain mitts. 
Mrs. Haze got me a handwarmer for Xmas - might come in handy!
How about all this extra weight and volume?  I haven't summed it all up yet but I suspect that a few extra ounces will be more than made up by less water and food carries that I am used to.",,View Entry,"Dec 31, Sat",0
Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659782,"I have slept with my food on all my hikes with the exception of a required bear vault in the Sierras on the PCT and hanging my food in grizzly country on the CDT from the Tetons to the Canadian border.  For the Colorado Trail this past summer, I did use an Opsack bag for food storage because of problem bears around road crossings and campgrounds.  Although I have seen and had close encounters with multiple black bears on several hikes and grizzly bears on the CDT, knock on wood, I have not had a problem with food storage.  I have been careful about food preparation, cleanup, and camping wherever possible away from road crossings and campgrounds.
Having said all that, I understand that the Appalachian Trail does traverse more populated areas with a healthy(?) population of habituated black bears.  I have seen the behavior of these bears in a few campgrounds and one encounter in a cabin in northern Colorado - the bear came in through a window and helped himself to everything in the pantry and fridge while Mrs. Haze and I were sleeping downstairs with the grandchildren.  The bear made a quick exit when confronted by Mrs. Haze and our dog early in the morning.  
I will camp wherever possible away from shelters and more populated areas, hanging my food in known problem areas and continue using the Opsack bag.  Mice will no doubt also be an issue to contend with.  My biggest problem on previous hikes has not been in the wild - it was the expensive but very old Many Glacier Lodge in Glacier National Park.  
I have had other encounters with nocturnal and salt-craving animals, even lost a few cork handles on hiking poles, but a bang or two on the tent usually sends them away.
I guess ticks are also something I will have to especially prepare for, more so than my other hikes, except for maybe the Great Divide Basin in Wyoming.  I also have always carried but rarely use a 1 oz head net for the mozzies and bugs.Getting excited for another adventure!",,View Entry,"Jan 07, Sat",0
Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659870,"I have said many times that the only way I can lose weight is to go on a long hike.  What a great excuse to go for a hike!  The only problem is that I eventually gain it back.  I will typically lose 20-25 lbs on longer hikes although my record is 40 lbs on the PCT.  Still learning about nutrition and a tough bout with giardia were contributing factors on that one.  I enjoyed my ""high school"" weight for a short while!
Getting my food together for the next adventure.  My trail diet usually consists of oatmeal, granola or pop tarts and Via instant coffee for breakfast, breakfast bar for a mid-morning snack, special nut and fruit trail mix for lunch, energy bar in the afternoon and dinner is an assortment of Knorr Rice/Pasta Sides or Instant Refried Beans with jerky, tuna, salmon, chicken or bacon bits with some store-bought freeze-dried meals thrown in.   I will add a few instant puddings for a sweet treat.  Town food is usually fun and a free-for-all!
I am a firm believer that most of the trail-hardening comes on-trail, just don't go out too hard, too fast.  Having said that, I will usually average daily 4-5 miles a day on trails or roads walking a happy lab, add the backpack and weight the last month before starting, light-weight training and stretching 4-5 times per week and a few bike rides per week.  If it was warmer and I was more diligent, I would do some lap swimming.  I think all this has helped strengthen the core and reduce risk of injury.I have worn a brace on a surgically repaired ankle for hikes the last few years.  I may do that for both ankles this time because of my supination, over-pronation issues.",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Mon",0
Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659988,"Got the schedule pretty well nailed down.  We've got some other plans this summer which may include parts of the Oregon Coast Trail, so it looks like I will be breaking the AT into a couple of large chunks.  Hope to get close to halfway on the AT by early June and then come back and finish next year.Base weight for this hike will be a bit over 12 lb. due to rain and cold weather gear.  Total weight will be in the low 20's - nice to not have long carries on food and water availability should be good!  As in previous hikes, I will be relying primarily on food drops - I know what I like and absolutely hate to waste time shopping on town days, unless for ice cream and town snacks. The pic is from the Superstition Mountains in Arizona, a beautiful desert range visited on both the AZT and GET.  It also happens to be the only place I have been shot at while on trail - on a backpacking trip while in high school, a buddy and I had bullets flying by, pinging off nearby rocks.  Never found the source, but suspected a deranged prospector looking for the Lost Dutchman Gold Mine.  There were quite a few ""characters"" in the hills in those days.",,View Entry,"Jan 28, Sat",0
Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660138,"Wow, what a game!  I got to watch a few players that carried my Purple Haze fantasy football team to first place in the regular season.  Always a bit of a letdown after the Super Bowl but the upcoming AT start date will help keep things on the upswing. I had a small hiccup in my training last week.  Just prior to just a scheduled teeth cleaning appointment, I chipped a crown on the left-side of my mouth testing a batch of my version of a Southwestern trail mix.  I suspect it was a very hard corn nut leaving a razor-sharp edge that was shredding my tongue.  After X-rays, the dentist was able to replace the crown at no cost (only 2 yrs. old), but then proceeded to tell me that the x-rays showed an abscessed tooth on the other side of my mouth that had an infection and needed to be pulled, with recommendations that it be replaced by a dental implant.  The oral surgeon just happened to be in the office to start this process!  I went home with a large gap (no implant until after the hike), stitches, antibiotics and a mouthful of Novocaine.Hoisted pretty much the full pack this morning and headed out with the dog.  I will be increasing the distance and add some favorite, local trails in the Catalinas here in Tucson.The pic is from an alternate to the Hayduke Trail I hiked in 2019.  Instead of heading straight to the Grand Canyon from the UT/AZ border, I hiked through the narrow Buckskin Gulch to the Paria River, eventually bushwhacking out of Paria Canyon, crossing the Paria Plateau and coming down the Vermillion Cliffs at the Sand Hill Crack.  Quite the adventure!",,View Entry,"Feb 13, Mon",0
Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660300,"Getting closer to getting back on the trail!Kind of a strange week, weather wise - actually cooler here in Tucson than Springer Mountain!  A bit of snowfall down to the base of the mountains last night.  Won't last for long however - we'll be in the 70's by next weekend.Got in close to an 8-mile hike this week with Mrs. Haze up in the nearby Catalinas.  Full dress rehearsal with full pack and good elevation gain - even got to cross a fast-flowing, icy creek several times.  Hope to get in a few more good trail days in the next few weeks to condition/toughen up the feet a bit.Resupply boxes are topped up and about ready to address and tape up.I arranged for a shuttle from Sandy Springs (REI) to Amicalola State Park and made a reservation at the Lodge, so it looks like I will at least be doing most of the approach trail to the official AT start at Springer Mountain. One of the tasks in the next few weeks will be treating my socks, gaiters, and outer garments with Permetherin, supposedly good for up to six washes.  I think a good, simple preventive measure to help avoid Lyme Disease which doesn't sound fun at all.  Besides ticks, does it help for the annoying mozzies?  I guess I will find out.",,View Entry,"Feb 26, Sun",0
Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/660832,"Pretty well set, just tying up some loose ends and enjoying the early spring weather in Arizona.  We headed up to the Phoenix area last weekend and enjoyed a couple of spring training games with old friends.  Major League Baseball has instituted new rules to speed up the game - I think a good move.  Hit 80 degrees on the last game and we had to lather on the sunscreen.  Having said that, I am not really looking forward to the forecasted cold, rainy start on the AT next week.  It does seem to be fairly typical weather this time of year.At this point I am planning to hike the 8-mile approach trail from Amicalola Falls State Park but, if offered a ride up to the official start on Springer Mountain, I would probably take it.Anxious to get on the trail!!",,View Entry,"Mar 15, Wed",0
Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661087,"First of all, I would like to give a shout out to Mrs Haze, my No 1 Trail Angel who has been so supportive of my passion for thru-hiking. She’s an avid hiker herself and my training partner but understandingly doesn’t like to sleep on the ground.  As such, she hiked the Cotswold Way in England last year with friends, staying in B&B’s every night - I’m quite jealous!
I had an uneventful flight to Atlanta today, even arriving early.  My duffle bag with pack was already unloading as I approached the baggage claim - now that was a first.  A straight shot to MARTA and a quick exit to Sandy Springs, near the end of the train line and a nearby REI.  Grabbed a gas canister, had a quick lunch and was picked up with two other hikers by Ron, a renowned AT shuttler with a wealth of trail knowledge.  Ron dropped me off at the Amiacolala Falls Visitors Center and I sat through the AT hiker’s orientation and got my AT hikers tag, No 1510, the ranger said probably smack dab in the middle of hikers starting this year.
It wasn’t until 4:30pm that I finally started up the infamous AT Approach Trail, through the Arch and up several hundred steep steps to the top of picturesque Amicalola Falls.  At the top, I detoured to the Lodge for dinner, a celebratory IPA and one last night in a bed.
Tomorrow I complete the last seven or so miles of the Approach Trail to the top of Springer Mountain and the official start of the AT!",,View Entry,"Mar 21, Tue",0
Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661235,"When I went to bed last night there was to be no rain until Saturday.  Up early this morning and checked the weather - drizzling rain until 8am.  Just light enough at 7:30am so took off on the approach trail thinking the rain was about to stop.  Four hours later I reach the AT start at Springer Mountain and it’s still raining - even harder.  I nearly missed the AT southern terminus monument in the mist and only noticed it two feet away while letting a couple of hikers pass by - my glasses were pretty fogged up.
Made my way down to the Springer Mountain parking lot and enjoyed my first trail magic (other than a raspberry sucker from Ron yesterday), hot coffee and donuts from two previous AT hikers.  Much appreciated!
Still raining when I stopped for a quick lunch at Stover Shelter and when I took a short detour to beautiful Long Creek Falls.  Finally decided to call it quits past Hightower Gap at a flat spot on a ridge with what would have been a nice view, but now only mist and low lying clouds.
The trail was muddy and slippery in spots but well maintained and not hard to follow, unlike many of my previous hikes.  Trees are mostly still bare with lots of dead leaves on the ground. Won’t take long to bud out if and when some warm days.
Rain started to slow down as I finished my dinner and hung my food bag.  A tall bear or one with a good vertical leap could have easily reached it but I was too tired and starting to cramp up while trying to do the PCT hang.
Not bad mileage, 16.5 miles for the first day  with some good elevation gain and inclement weather, but only 9.5 miles count on the official AT.
My hiking clothes are drenched and obviously won’t dry overnight so won’t be fun putting them on tomorrow.","Springer Mountain

Dumped my pack off and headed straight to a tasty lunch of blackened chicken tacos, picked up my resupply box and got a few snacks at the nearby Ingles grocery store.  I was able to check in soon after returning to the motel and started the cleanup process (me, clothes and gear) and hiker chores.
While washing clothes, a fellow hiker was drying his Zpacks Duplex tent and I noticed a big patch right on top of the tent.  He told me first day out with his brand new tent, his buddy was trying to swing a rock sack over a high tree limb to hang his food bag.  On his first attempt the throw got away from him and the rock sack flew high in the air, landing smack dab on top of his tent, leaving a large hole.  Not to plug Zpacks, but even though this was not the tent’s fault, they are sending him a loaner tent.

I heard right but the best part was they had a  full table of drinks, snacks and fruit to keep you occupied until the next shuttle van arrived.  Great conversation with the generous and gracious volunteers.One cool thing while there was I met a hiker, Dave, who came down after me.  We got to talking and discovered we had both hiked the PCT ten years ago in 2013.  Not only that but we finished at the Canadian border on the same day - small world!Gatlinburg is in a pretty setting as a gateway to the Smokies but quite a culture chock, chock full of tourists and tourist traps, several owned by Ripley’s.  It’s also a jump off point to the Dollywood amusement park.Walked across town, checked into my motel and immediately stripped off my soggy hiking clothes - hard to stay dry on this trail.  Later, after washing clothes and myself, I only had the energy to hobble across the street to Chesapeakes Seafood and Raw Bar.  Glad I did because what a treat - first time I’ve a hiker town meal of oysters and shrimp & grits.","Siler’s Bald Shelter NC

Absolutely my favorite day on the trail with “more” of everything - more energy from a double zero, more sunshine, more gorgeous views, and definitely more hikers although they spread out quickly.
Leapfrogged with largely a new group of young hikers, including Whispering Moose, up and down ridgelines through dense, moss covered evergreen forests.  Expansive views of the Smokies, especially from Charlies Bunion, many low lying clouds far below maybe left over from the passing storm.
My initial destination was the Tri-Corner Knob Shelter but didn’t see any suitable tent sites where I wouldn’t slide down the mountain or be on top of the spring.  A few hacking hikers so didn’t want to stay inside the shelter so loaded up on water and kept moving - the next shelter was eight miles away.  Not supposed to camp outside the shelter area in the NP but it became evident I wouldn’t reach the next shelter until after dark.  At dusk I reached a high ridge that happened to also be a backcountry grass helipad - too good to pass up and a safe haven.","Newfound Gap, NC/TN Stateline

The trail back up the other side came close to the Standing Bear Hostel so I took a short detour to check it out.  They have bunks, small cabins and a little store that seemed popular and convenient for hikers.  I settled for a Dr Pepper and ice cream, then loaded up on water for a long uphill push.  Five miles later and 2,500 feet higher, I found a nice campsite past Snowbird Mountain.","Helipad past Mt Guyot, GSMNP

Another reason I like Hot Springs is that the AT goes right through town.  When I reached Main Street I met Kim, a local resident, walking her dog.  Nice chat and fortunately her walk was my walk for a few miles so she guided me where to exit the highway past the bridge and where the best vista points were.  The trail followed the wide and fast flowing French Broad River for a short while before climbing steeply up and eventually out of the river canyon.
Springtime was in full swing at lower elevations which also had the appearance of a rain forest.  Maybe that’s why it rained quite a bit with an intense but short thunder and lightening storm.  I put on my rain jacket and kept moving.
Had lunch just before Allen Gap, crossed the highway and was met by a nice trail angel who offered soda and snacks.  I took advantage of a camp chair, had a soda and he filled me in on what to expect up the trail.

Missed but the first goat now knew I was serious.  He finally dropped it but I had to run a fair ways to retrieve the pole, now with teeth marks and all wet with smelly goat saliva.  It was only later that I learned that these same goats were gaining quite a reputation among AT hikers.Later in the afternoon, the trail followed Pine Swamp Branch (creek) all the way down to Big Stony Creek and I then followed this creek upstream until reaching a roadside/creekside pullout at Big Stony Creek Road, VA 635.  Found a picnic table and a flat spot to put up the tent.  Don’t expect too much traffic tonight.New birds today included an indigo bunting and a Philadelphia vireo.","Pearisburg VA

I was about 30 pounds down on my official weigh-in, pretty typical after my longer hikes.  I should try to keep some of it off this time but I wouldn't bet on it.
A few observations, thoughts and comparisons:
The AT has been a cardio/cardiac challenge with very consistent 4,500 to 6,000+ total vertical feet of elevation on a daily basis.The best water quality and quantity of any of my long hikes.Hard to get lost on the clearly marked AT, a real battery saver not having to check on location.  With all the exposed tree roots and rocks on the trail, I have tripped, stumbled and fallen more on the AT than any other hike.  With my wonky ankles, I consider myself fortunate to have escaped more serious damage.I have heard the AT called a long green tunnel and that's no joke, especially May in Virginia.
Best day on the trail: Easter Sunday heading north from Newfound Gap (near Gatlinburg TN) on a beautiful day in the Smoky Mountains, low lying clouds and mist lifting from the forests below, rare expansive views, capped off with a gorgeous sunset and sunrise from my ""helicopter pad"" ridgetop campsite, slightly against the park rules.
Best trail town: Hot Springs NC, scenic spot on the French Broad River, everything a hiker would want in a compact, little   town including good eats and entertainment at the local brewery.
Strangest animal encounter: the small herd of goats I encountered out of Pearisburg VA that picked up one of my hiking poles and ran away, furiously chewing the cork handle.
Best meal:  Oysters and shrimp & grits from Chesapeakes Seafood and Raw Bar in Gatlinburg TN.
Best dessert: Huge hunk of blackberry ice cream pie at the Skyland Lodge, Shenandoah National Park. I refuse to believe it was the cause of me being sick later that night.
Best new piece of gear:  actually not gear but a new app, Merlin Bird ID that can ID from photos or sound recordings.  Fun, learned something and constructive on some of those long days in the green tunnel.  Looking forward to the second half and thanks for following along!",,View Entry,"Jun 12, Mon",0
