Big Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659856,"I’m 68 this year, happily married to Debbie for 48 years, I have 1 daughter and 2 grandsons.  My trail name has yet to be determined.  


I always enjoyed hiking and began backpacking 40+ years ago.  Although I have completed many miles of AT section hikes in Virginia, thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail has always been a dream.   


Last fall I made the decision to thru-hike in 2024, now that dream is a reality.


I plan to post to this journal frequently once I begin my thru-hike. 


============


The rest of this page will be for the 95% of people (basically all of my family and friends) who read this journal, and are not familiar with some of the basics of the AT, and thru-hiking.  I’m going to try this as a FAQ-style write-up:
What is the AT? 
It’s a 2194-mile footpath that runs from Georgia to Maine.  It was knitted together in the 1930’s from existing and newly constructed trails running along the Appalachian spine of the eastern USA.  Some tidbits:
It passes through 14 statesSupposedly requires 5 million steps to walk….my stride is a little longer than some, so maybe it’s only a mere 4.9M!You gain (and lose) enough elevation to summit Everest 16 times during the hike.
What is a thru-hike?  Hiking the entire trail in one 12-month period.  Various people impose various “rules” on what they consider a thru-hike…things like:  not skipping a single meter of trail and not having any support from friends whatsoever.  There are three popular approaches to thru-hiking:


NoBo
Starting at the southern terminus, Springer Mountain in Georgia, and hiking northbound to the northern terminus, Mt. Katahdin in Maine. 


SoBo
Starting at the northern terminus, Mt. Katadin in Maine, and hiking south to the southern terminus, Springer Mountain in Georgia.  


Flip-Flop
Starting at one place hiking, flipping to another, flopping back until you finish.  This option provides the most flexibility for speed, weather, and time off the trail if needed.


I will be completing a Flip-Flop.  


Are you going by yourself?  Yes, and No.  I will be setting off by myself, however on any given day, I will encounter and potentially hike alongside other folks undertaking the same pursuit. 


Where do you sleep? 
Generally, in a tent that I carry with me.  There are “shelters” interspersed fairly regularly along the trail (every 8 to 15 miles or so).  These shelters are typically three-sided structures with a roof that can fit 6-18 people in them.  Usually arrayed around the shelter are level spots for people to pitch tents as well.  I plan to mostly stay at the shelter sites, as there is typically a reliable water source there, and other folks to converse with.  
What do you eat?
Whatever is light, calorie-dense, shelf-stable, fits in my pack, and is available at the various small stores in the towns near the AT.  Think ramen, rice, cured meats, energy bars, trail mix, nuts, etc.  I carry a backpacking stove and fuel to heat water to rehydrate food when I camp at night. I will typically be burning through 4000-5000 calories per day, and I need to eat a similar amount of food to keep my energy at a functional level.  Thru-hikers tend to gorge themselves “in-town” when making a resupply stop, and I’m sure I will do the same. 


How long does it take? When are you starting & finishing?
Most people require between 5 to 7 months of walking.  I know that my starting date is going to be mid February, and I know that I am going to be off-trail for about 9 days in early late July to enjoy my 50th wedding anniversary party.  Yes, you read that correctly, Debbie is wonderfully encouraging and supportive.  


I’ll move fast and far when I feel strong; I’ll move slow when I don’t.  I’ll be done, when I’m done.


Are you worried about bears, snakes, wolves, serial killers, zombies, rabid raccoons and things that go bump in the night? No. 


Are you bringing an assortment of weapons and training in combat skills to thwart the above assortment of hobgoblins?  No.


Are you worried about injury, hypothermia, ticks, and water-borne parasites?   Worried,  no!  But I am respectful of the risks.
 
What are you doing about it?
Injury: Training myself as best I can before I start…strengthening legs, knees, ankles, core.  Being smart, especially in the early days on the trail, about not pushing too hard to the point where I get sloppy and heighten the risk of injury. Hypothermia:  The AT is famously wet.  I will be rained on or snowed on for at least 20% of the hours I hike during the trip. Guaranteed.   I am starting the trip in February, and even in Georgia and NC, it can be quite cold in the mountains at that time of year.  Having the proper layering system for clothing, and ensuring that I am carrying dry clothes to change into at night is crucial.  Since you can’t carry a wardrobe full of clothes, you put your wet clothes back on each morning (you warm up quickly while your internal engine is pushing you through the woods), and save the dry stuff for resting in camp at night. Ticks:  check myself every day and pluck ‘em off before they can deliver their payload of Lyme disease (it takes a day or more of attachment before the nasty stuff transmits to the human body).Water-borne parasites:  I, like most hikers, carry a small water filter. 


Are you carrying a phone?  Yes, although coverage will be limited during much of the hike.  It’s OK….people successfully completed this hike for 50+ years before the advent of mobile phones.  They are certainly nice to have, and enable a hiker to stay connected to the modern world throughout the hike if so desired….but it’s not the end of the world if I can’t check the score of the Sox game for a couple days.",,View Entry,"Jan 10, Tue",0
