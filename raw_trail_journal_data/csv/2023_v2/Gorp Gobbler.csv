Gorp Gobbler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/644677,"For those of you that have been following along with me on this journal, I want to bring you up to date with what’s been happening.

I had planned on starting a Flip-Flop hike out of Harpers Ferry, W. Va., May 12th of this year, heading North to Katahdin, however, while hiking over in John Bryan State Park the Sunday before I was to leave, the condition I have in my spine decided to flare up which kept that from happening.

My Chiropractor had me to the point where I could walk without much of a gimp at all in my right leg, which excited me, knowing I was getting to return to the trail.

Usually, his adjustments worked wonders in restoring my mobility, that wasn’t to be the case this time.  Granted, they helped for a short time, but I was needing something long-lasting if I was to return.  On one of my visits, he did some X-rays and found my right ilium bone had rotated out of position.

By July, my condition had worsened to where I couldn’t walk at all except in a hunched-over position.  Standing for any length of time was out of the question and then sitting for long periods even became difficult.  The only relief I could find was lying in bed.

After an MRI, my doctor referred me over to the neurological department.  The MRI showed I had severe stenosis at L3-L4, along with some disk degeneration, disc bulges, protrusions, and extrusions.  I had an appointment made but wasn’t going to get in until August 24th.

I met with the same neurosurgeon I had in 2019 when I discovered I had problems with my spine.  In 2019, I was told he didn’t want to do surgery yet.  In 2019, he had me go through physical therapy, which helped, but I was still gimpy.  This time, he wanted me to try epidural steroid injections, which I did, one on September 7th and another on September 21st.

When you’re backpacking, you always reach “Milestones”, be it the ¼ of the way sign, Fontana Dam, Newfound Gap, Woods Hole Hostel, or Damascus, to name a few.  I reached a Milestone so to speak on September 24th, I was able to stand and walk erect after 2 ½ months of walking hunched over.  Then on September 28th, I was able to stand in the shower, still in some pain, but bearable.

I’m now going to another Chiropractor/Physical Medicine Center here in town.  I had some shock therapy yesterday, and today will get some more, along with adjustments.  My hip has been hurting quite a bit, so perhaps the ilium bone needs to be set again.

I’m sure the burning and numbness in my right ankle is from a nerve being pinched, so hopefully, with some acupuncture, which they also have here, I’ll get relief from that.",,View Entry,"Sep 30, Thu",0
Gorp Gobbler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645077,"I know there are those around us that live with pain every day, some, unfortunately, live with it until they die, and this indeed is a sad thing.  Perhaps it’s some form of birth defect, or maybe the result of an accident, or war injury, or even a dreaded disease.

With that being said, the pain I’ve been dealing with since 2019, is the result of Spinal Stenosis, the narrowing of the space around the spinal cord where it passes through your vertebrae.  This narrowing is caused by the build-up of some form of matter.  This matter puts pressure on the nerves.

In my case, the nerves in my right leg are affected causing excruciating pain in my hip and ankle.  The ankle pain makes me want to favor my ankle, thus resulting in a gimped style of walking.  It also causes tightness on my right side, which makes me want to haunch over to relieve this discomfort.

I have loved hiking ever since I went on my first Boy Scout hike at the age of 11.  Even if I wasn’t on an official Boy Scout hike, it wasn’t anything for me to take off and start walking and perhaps be gone all day.  My parents never worried about me, I remember my mom telling another lady, “He knows his way around the creeks and wood lots that he frequents and where and when to get a meal”.

I discovered the Appalachian Trail while attending a National Boy Scout Jamboree, as the Scoutmaster of my hometown Troop.  This was back in 1973, the year I made my first summit of Mount Katahdin.  I was in the workforce so every year when I had vacation time, I was on the trail doing a section of it.

Here it is, soon to be 47 years later, and I’m still wanting to hike this trail.  My love for hiking and being outdoors is just as strong now as it was on that first Boy Scout hike.

I’m told my gimpy leg and the pain associated with it, can be repaired with surgery, however, I’m told by the neurosurgeon that “he” doesn’t want to do it yet, which I didn’t understand until the other day, is because of Medicare.

Apparently, Medicare wants doctors to exhaust all forms of alternative treatments before they’ll pay for surgery.  I did physical therapy in 2019, I had (2) epidural steroid injections in September, and have been seeing Chiropractors for the past 2 years.  Yesterday, I tried acupuncture for the first time and actually was pain-free, but it didn’t last.

I never was one to “get a second opinion”, but this Thursday (10/14/21), I’m going to see another doctor in a different Medical Group than the one I’ve been using and see what they have to say.  Who knows, they may be able to fix me up good and proper so I can get back out on the trails.",,View Entry,"Oct 12, Tue",0
Gorp Gobbler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645754,"With November well underway I know a lot of prospective “Thru-Hikers” begin their count down to when they will step foot on the trail.  Having said this, I want to wish these folks the Best of Luck on their journeys.

For me, I’m not sure what 2022 will offer as far as hiking.  I’m pretty sure a Thru-Hike will not be in my future, but one never knows.

A few weeks ago, I switched Chiropractors.  I found one here in town that along with doing adjustments also does “acupuncture”.  Four sessions of having pins stuck all over my body has not lessened my pain.

For those of you that have been following along with me in this journal, you know I started having problems with walking back in 2019 due to spinal stenosis.  My condition has progressively gotten worse to where if I wasn’t so bullheaded, I’d have given up and become an invalid.

On a recent Chiropractor visit, after my adjustment, the doctor asked if I thought the adjustment did any good.  I replied, “I appreciate what you’re trying to do Dr. Jeff, but I think my condition is beyond chiropractic care”.  He agreed with me and said he was referring me over to a neurosurgeon. 
I’m to see this neurosurgeon on December 10, just 3 days after my 70th Birthday.  If this doctor can restore my ability to walk “pain-free”, I’ll consider this The Best Birthday Present Ever.

I’m sure I’ll have physical therapy to do should an operation be in store for me, so I’m hoping my bullheadedness will have me giving everything I got doing it.

Most of this year has been spent in idleness as far as biking and hiking goes, so I know I’m definitely out of shape.  The spare tire around my middle has increased by several pounds so I’m going to want to shed this weight, or at least part of it before hitting the trail.  I know the trail will take off weight without a problem.  On March 26, 2015, I weighed 223 pounds when I left Springer Mountain.  In Pearisburg, Va., I went to the hospital, I was having trouble with my right leg, they weighed me, I was down to 175 pounds and eating everything I got my hands on.

I notice I don’t eat as much as I use to and that’s common with older folks.  I wonder how “trail hunger” will affect me.  When backpacking, you burn up a lot of calories, so maybe I’ll turn into a lean, food-eating, hiking machine. (Actually, I’ll probably stay an Overweight, food-eating, slow but steady hiker).

Depending on how everything goes once I see the neurosurgeon, will determine when and if I start a hike in 2022.

Gorp Gobbler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646198,"This year has flown by so fast, it seems like just the other day I was making preparations for my Flip-Flop hike when actually it was back in May.

I didn’t get much done in the way of exercising, as my spinal stenosis has progressively gotten worse, so much so that I’m in constant pain with every little move.

I met with a new neurosurgeon on December 10, and after a thorough examination, he thinks I might have a cervical vertebra that is blocking some nerves.  He ordered an MRI for that region as well as some X-rays of me standing erect. I’ll get these done on January 24.  Once he has these results, he’ll know what to do first as far as treatment.

He looked at the results of an earlier MRI I had done and said that the L3 and L4 were definitely showing signs of blockage and that surgery is necessary to correct them.

When I told him I enjoyed backpacking, he said, “I’ll have you out backpacking next year”.  These were words I was hoping to hear.

I still don’t look to be a Thru-Hiker, but I sure would count it a blessing, to be a member of the Class of 2022 “Backpackers”!

Gorp Gobbler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/650165,"It’s been a while since my last post, so I thought I’d write one today in order to bring everyone that actually reads my journal, up to date.
I had my other MRI done on January 24th.  This one was on my cervical area.  The results showed significate damage in that area. After meeting with my neurosurgeon, he has reason to believe that surgery there, “might” correct the problem I’m having with my Lumbar region.  He said we could give it a couple of months and if I was still having problems with my walking, then he would operate down there to correct it.  I’m to meet with him on May 11th to view the actual MRI CD images and to set up a date for surgery.

I’m being optimistic thinking that an operation on my cervical vertebrae, will do the trick so that I can still get a little hiking done this year.  I would also like to ride the “Bike Trail” from Cincinnati to Cleveland.  
I’ve been following the journals of a few 2022 Classmates, thus keeping my hopes and dreams alive with each mile they hike.

Any short hikes I could do locally would be awesome, but with my unsteady legs, I wouldn’t want to do them alone.

The new Primary Care Physician I acquired on the first of this year has been simply amazing.  Before she even saw me for the first time, she ordered a prescription for Duloxetine which has worked wonders in relaxing my nerves.  I now can stand erect, I have no problems sleeping, and I’m in very little if any pain.  This medication was ordered after talking with me on the phone.

If “no” hiking this year is in my future, I’m entertaining the idea, even with the high cost of gasoline, to drive out to the trail somewhere to offer Trail Magic to anyone that would like it.  I’ll no more after my surgery.

Until then…",,View Entry,"May 03, Tue",0

The “Class of 2022 Thru-Hikers” are spread out along the trail making their way either North or South.

I’m anxiously waiting for July 11th, the date I go in for Cervical surgery.  My neurosurgeon informed me that the disks in my C3/C4 and C5/C6 need to be removed, and replacements added.  He believes that correcting this problem may take care of the problems I’m having in the Lumbar region of my spine.  He said, we will give it a couple of months, and then if I’m still having problems with walking, we would repair the Lumbar vertebrae that are needing to be repaired.

In the meantime, I’m planning on taking a hiker from Madison, IN out to Harpers Ferry so that he can begin his “Flip-Flop” hike.  Once he reaches Maine, I may drive up and get him, to bring him back to Harpers Ferry, so that he can hike the Southern half of the trail.

I’m not exactly sure when we will be heading over to HF, but I may have some Trail Magic to disperse to the hikers wanting it.

While I’m out that way, I’ll probably visit some Civil War sites, I’ll see.

Good Luck to all the hikers on the trail.",,View Entry,"Jun 01, Wed",0
Gorp Gobbler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/654036,"I never thought I would say, “I’m looking forward to having surgery”, but I am.

There was time I counted down the days before starting a hike, I even had an online account with a “count-down” clock.  Now, I’m counting down the days until July 11, when I go in to have (2) cervical disks removed.  These disks have bone spurs that are poking into my spinal cord and affecting my ability to walk correctly.

Even though there’s significant damage in my Lumbar region as well, my neurosurgeon seems to think that correcting the problem in my neck may take care of my walking problem.

He told me I wouldn’t be able to drive for the first week, but after that, I shouldn’t have any problem.  He also said I would be in a neck collar for (3) months, but that I could take it off to shower and shave.

Having been inactive for the past three years has been a tough pill for me to swallow.  I’m looking forward to the day I can shoulder my pack once again and take off on a hike.

Before my release, my neurosurgeon came to my room and got me up for a walk.  He told me to look ahead and to swing my arms when I walk.  I was amazed, I had NO Gimpy Legs!!  He went on to say, “for the next 3 months I want you to walk every day and I don’t care if you walk 100 times a day, walk and swing those arms”.

He told me the arm swings help with one’s balance.  I never had given that a thought before.  Well, being a hiker I have no problem following the Dr’s. orders.

Gorp Gobbler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/657082,"Heeding the words of my neurosurgeon ‘to walk’, I grabbed my daypack, tossed in a bottle of water and a few snacks, and with neck collar/brace in place, I set off for Hocking Hills here in Ohio this past Thursday (08/25/2022).

My destination was “Big Pine Pillar” or as some folks call it “Balancing Rock”.  The parking lot at the trailhead had two cars in it when I got there and the owners of them, were getting to leave, so I knew the trail would be all mine.

Not having done any hiking for the past 3 years and with the incline I wanted, I did make pretty good time getting up to the Pillar.

Being used to hiking with trekking poles, I opted not to take mine this time, remembering my doctor saying “swing your arm when you walk”.  I had a few places to navigate where the poles would have been handy, but I got through okay.

I’m ready for another one, maybe a little bit longer next time, this 2.02-mile hike got my appetite wet.

This past Tuesday, I went and had X-rays taken (per my neurosurgeon’s request), and the results showed everything was perfect.  I’ll meet with the doctor now so he can show me the exercises he wants me to do.

I’m still in the neck collar/brace and will be until my doctor releases me from it, which I’m hoping, will be soon.

I would love to be out hiking or riding my bike more often, but since I have to wear this collar all of the time, even when sleeping, I know that after a few times of these types of activities, said collar would get to stink after a while.  The smell probably wouldn’t bother me all that much, being a backpacker, but those around me, the city types, probably wouldn’t appreciate it.

In looking at the journal entries for the “Class of 2023” I see a lot of variation in start dates and start locations but I’m sure we’ll cross paths with each other someplace along the trail.

As of right now, I’m still planning on heading out to Harpers Ferry some time mid-April.  My plans are to head North and see how far these Old Bones and Joints will carry me.

If I can stay on the trail thru May I want to come home for a Southern Gospel Music Quartet concert on June 3rd.  “Ernie Haase & Signature Sound” are performing at the Ohio Star Theater up in Sugarcreek, OH.  I organize Outings and Events for the folks at the church where I attend and having seen this quartet once before, I’m hoping to take a group to see them again.

Providing I’m not experiencing any major knee problems by this time my plans are to return to the trail and see how far I can go.  I know a visit with the Orthopedic Specialist for a couple of Steroid Injections prior to starting out will help with my plans.

I just turned 71 on December 7th and I try to maintain an active lifestyle.  Even though I’m retired I enjoy helping others with projects they are doing.  I hike when I can as well as ride my bike.

Pointing to some shady areas on the X-rays he told me that this was new bone developing around the disks that he replaced back in July.  “This is very good”, he said.

I was told that I had NO Restrictions and that I could do anything I wanted.  When I told him about my hike this summer, he highly encouraged it.  He also said I had no weight restrictions for my pack, for me to carry whatever was comfortable.  So if the doctor says it’s “OK”, it must be “OK”!

I’m to see him in July but when I said I could still be on the trail then, he told me to make an appointment when I get back.

I’m hoping to stay on the trail for as long as I can providing my knees hold up, I am having some trouble with them, but that comes with old age and the fact I was a long-distance runner in high school.

I’m definitely not going to be in a hurry this time so I’m hoping that will prevent any injury and allow me to remain on the trail.

It would be nice to have a compatible hiking partner but I usually hike with whoever happens to be in the same area as I am.  I know the trail will have other “Flip-Flop” hikers starting at about the same time as me, so I’m sure there will be someone to hike with.

The last time I saw my Orthopedic Specialist, I was told that I’m a prime candidate for knee replacement because of my activity level.  He also said, because of my activity the steroid injections I’ve been getting in my knees will keep on working for me if I choose to keep getting them.

I heard an advertisement on the radio that a person could avoid knee replacement surgery just by getting fitted with proper “arch supports”.  I think I’ll pay a visit to our local Good Feet Store to see what they have to say.  I know these arch supports are expensive but not as expensive as replacement surgery will be and they are pain-free unless you consider the pain in your wallet.

I’ll be ordering the updated version of ATC’s “Thru-Hiker’s Companion” and “Data Book” before long.  I like to figure out somewhat of a plan for resupply, shelter/campsite stops, and interesting things to see along the trail, for example (Gettysburg and Hershey, Pa.)

There is a good stealth campsite at Pa. 325 (Clarks Valley), with room enough for 3 to 4 tents.  I don’t know if it’s listed in the newer publications, but I checked with the folks that maintain the trail in this section a few years ago otherwise it’s 18 miles between Peters Mountain Shelter and Rausch Gap Shelter.

One of the most confusing topics for new Appalachian Trail thru-hikers to plan as they attempt to coordinate their adventure is how to figure out the right amount of food to last between resupplies. An unfortunate effect is that many hikers start out carrying way too much food weight. This can evolve from a minor to a major problem, and too frequently causes injury early on in a hike because not only are your legs not ready for endurance walking up and down strenuous mountains, but they’re also ill-prepared to manage the weight of an extra 30-40 pounds.

Pre-hike tip #1: Buy ATC’s “Thru-Hiker’s Companion”.  Plan to start at a 10-mile-per-day pace the first week of your hike until you learn your limits as a hiker.

Pre-hike tip #2: As you start your northbound journey, if starting at Amicalola, plan for four days of food.  For each day, plan a breakfast, a second breakfast, lunch, two afternoon snacks, and a substantial dinner including protein. Add some comfort chocolate or other goodies if you prefer. If your food bag weighs more than ten pounds leaving north from Springer or Amicalola, you’re carrying more food than you will need to get to your first easy resupply point.

Listed below are the best resupply points along the Appalachian Trail.  With a few exceptions, AT hikers will rarely go more than 50 miles without a resupply option. 

Mile 31 – Mountain Crossings: A full-service outfitter with full resupply, the trail will run you right into the front door of this first stop along the trail.  As mentioned above, you don’t need more than four days of food to get you here.

Mile 52 OR 69 – Hiawassee, GA: If you stay at Top of Georgia hostel, 706-982-3252, [GC1] multiple shuttles are available into town. Budget Inn, 706-896-4121 in Hiawassee is another lodging option that will come pick you up and deliver you back to the trail if you choose to stay there.

Mile 110 – Franklin, NC: At Winding Stair Gap, US 64, hitch a ride into Franklin. Or call Haven’s Budget Inn at 828-524-4403 and see if they can pick you up. While in town, visit the Lazy Hiker Brewing Company and Rock House Lodge to celebrate exiting your first state!  You can also resupply at Gooder Grove Hostel & Adventure Ctr.

Mile 137 –Nantahala Outdoor Center: No hitch required! NOC outfitters is on site with gear and food resupply.

Mile 164 – Fontana General Store: Located 2 miles west of the A.T. from the point you cross Hwy 28. The trail takes you right to the visitor’s center which offers snacks, but I wouldn’t call it a full resupply.  This is your last chance to print your Smokies permit and to resupply before entering the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

Mile 207 – Newfound Gap, Gatlinburg: A shuttle or hitch is definitely required to make it 15 miles from here into Gatlinburg, but if you’ve never experienced the city, it’s worth the trip! Resupply options, honestly, aren’t as great as you’d expect in a town with so much to offer, but there’s enough to be found at pharmacies and the tiny grocers on the strip to make it another few days on trail.  Unique experiences, a plethora of food, and Smoky Mountain Brewery are a few notable mentions in town.

Mile 241 –Standing Bear Farm Hostel, off of Green Corner Road: Though certainly not a Walmart, this hostel offers adequate resupply options as you exit the Smokies.

I also stopped a mile shy of reaching Old Man's Cave, I listened to my body and it said I was spent.Perhaps the next hike will have me going the entire distance both ways, we'll see 👀!",,View Entry,"Feb 25, Sat",0
Gorp Gobbler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661253,"In 2015 I set out on March 26, from Springer Mountain, GA., to “Thru-Hike” the Appalachian Trail.  I made it to Pearisburg, VA, and even after early on in my hike, I contracted Norovirus and spent 4 days in a hospital in Murphy, NC.

During this hike, I experienced quite a bit of muscle tightness which forced me off the trail in Pearisburg.

Some said it was due to a lack of stretching and I admitted that I seldom stretched before starting each morning.  I also believe that was the early stages of the spinal problem that I’m dealing with now.

After returning home from the trail I started noticing a drag with my right foot then at a Chiropractor visit I said something about it.  The Chiropractor adjusted my L4/L5 vertebrae, it helped but didn’t fix the problem.

An MRI showed significant damage in this area where surgery would be necessary to correct it.  The neurosurgeon I had at the time didn’t want to operate, instead, he wanted me to try different methods of pain relief.  I wanted the problem FIXED.

I switched neurosurgeons and during my first consultation with the new doctor, he noticed a weakness in my upper limbs.  Another MRI (cervical region) showed bone spurs growing into my spinal cord.

I was to the point I could barely walk without being in pain and only with the aid of a cane or stick.  On July 11, 2022, surgery was done and I was pain-free when I walked and I didn’t need a cane or stick.  I actually ran from the hospital over to the parking garage where my friend that came to get me had parked.

My neurosurgeon told me that the L4/L5 problem may be needed to be fixed in order to have complete “correct” mobility.

I made plans to head over the Harpers Ferry this April to begin a “Flip-Flop” hike or at least a “LASH”, but the way I’m moving now, I think it would be a Bust.

Instead, I think I’ll go down for Trail Days this year, and perhaps offer whatever service I can give to help other hikers fulfill their dreams of completing the trail.

Gorp Gobbler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/661998,"The start of my “Flip-Flop” or “LASH” hike from Harpers Ferry, W. Va., was supposed to have begun either today or tomorrow, however, the bones and joints in my body had other ideas which didn’t involve backpacking.

I think in an earlier post, I wrote about concerns I was having with my right leg and foot.  Even with increased activity, I’m still having problems but they aren’t to the point where I’m needing a stick or cane to be mobile as I needed a year ago.

Knowing and listening to my body, I think trying to start a backpacking trip the way I feel would not be a good decision on my part and definitely be a waste of time and money.

I’m to see the neurosurgeon in July for a “One Year” follow-up, but I called the other day to set up an appointment and could only leave a message.

I did manage to get a 5.25-mile hike (walk) in yesterday out at the Scioto Grove Metro Park, beginning and ending it with plenty of stretching, which I know helped considerably. 
Now that our weather is much nicer, I’m going to increase my activity by riding my bike and hiking a lot more.

Gorp Gobbler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/665696,"For those of you that have been following my journal, you may be wondering what has happened to me.

I was to begin hiking in mid-April of this year, however, 3 to 4 weeks before my start date I noticed my right foot was wanting to drag when I walked.

I knew from last year the results of an MRI showed significant damage to my L4/L5 Vertabre that surgery was necessary to correct it.

The neurosurgeon I had then didn’t want to do surgery until he exhausted all other means of fixing the problem.

Once I switched hospitals, doctors, and neurosurgeons, in January 2022, I began receiving the care I needed.

My new neurosurgeon said, he didn’t see any results of the Cervical region of my spine on the MRI, even though I was told I received a complete MRI from the hospital where I was being treated at.

Once I had the Cervical MRI results, the new neurosurgeon discovered bone spurs on my C3/C4 and C4/C5 vertebrae that were protruding into my spinal cord.  July 11th of 2022 I had Cervical Discectomy surgery performed on these vertebrae.
Now my new neurosurgeon has ordered an updated MRI and X-rays for me and once he has these results he said he would have me come in for surgery consultation.

I’m still staying as active as I can, biking and hiking locally with hopes of returning to the AT or some other long-distance trail perhaps next year.",,View Entry,"Jun 19, Mon",0
Gorp Gobbler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/666581,"This coming Wednesday, July 12, 2023, I’ll be going in for an updated MRI and some X-Rays per my Neurosurgeon’s orders.  The last MRI I had done showed significant damage to my L4/L5 vertebrae to where surgery would be necessary to repair them.
A Cervical MRI that I had done separately revealed bone spurs on my C3/C4 and C4/C5 vertebrae which were protruding into my spinal cord.  On July 11, 2022, I had these vertebrae removed and replaced with synthetic ones.

Now that I’m becoming “gimpy” (again) on my right side, my neurosurgeon wants to repair the L4/L5 vertebrae and I’m ready to have them repaired.

I’m not a doctor but I believe by fixing these problems with my spine, it might correct the problems I’m having with my knees, I can’t only hope it does.

So once the MRI and X-Ray results are back, I’ll be called in for Surgery Consultation, which could be as early as next month.

Gorp Gobbler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/668192,"In case those of you that have been following my journal wonder what has happened to me, I’ll give you a Reader’s Digest version of what’s going on.

I was to begin either a “Flip-Flop” style Thru-Hike or a LASH, in mid-April of this year.  A few weeks before I was to head out to Harpers Fery, I noticed my right leg starting to become “gimpy” and that I was dragging my right foot.

I had surgery scheduled for August 16 but my insurance company denied coverage, saying that I would have to extinguish all other forms of treatment first.

I did physical therapy and had two epidural steroid injections in 2021 when there was just one vertebra that was problematic, neither of these treatments “fixed” the problem.

Now, I have two vertebrae showing signs of closing around the spinal cord and a Neurosurgeon that will operate, unlike the one I had in 2021.

I appealed the insurance company’s decision and notified my Neurosurgeon and Chiropractor, so now I wait to see if coverage will be granted, as these doctors have spoken with them.

My mobility has gotten worse from what it was in April, so hopefully something will be determined soon and for the good.

Once I’m fixed up and can start backpacking again, I’ve been entertaining the idea of doing “Fall” Section Hikes.  I love the Fall Season and I think it would make for an enjoyable hike.

Please stay tuned!",,View Entry,"Aug 19, Sat",0
