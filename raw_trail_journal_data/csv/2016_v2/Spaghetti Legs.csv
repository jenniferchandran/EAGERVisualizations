Spaghetti Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521229,"Call me Spaghetti Legs. You have found the journal of my attempted 2016 thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail. In the real world I am a 35 year old civil engineer from the Chicago area. My backpacking experience is brief but beautiful. Without further ado, I will start by telling you the story of my first and only backpacking trip that I took in the fall.Wednesday, 10/14/2015Today began at the Super-8 motel in Whitewater, WI. My wife agreed to travel up with me last night and drop me off at the start of my 4-day, 3-night hike through Waukesha County, WI. As part of our arrangement, she would be dropping me off by 6:30am to allow her enough time to get back to work.So after the final additions were made to my pack, we enjoyed a small breakfast. We reached the trail start point shortly after that, took a photo, and said our goodbyes. Being a first-time overnight backpacker, I was carrying about 4 liters of water, and I believe my pack weighted around 42 pounds. That's a little misleading because due to the change in weather forecast: Clear but much colder, and active hunting seasons (small game and archery) I brought my bright orange heavy sweatshirt. This added weight as well.The path was well maintained. Unfortunately as I was climbing up a hill not more than a mile into my trip, I kept following the well maintained wide path, and completely missed the narrow path that intersected to the left. Fortunately, I hadn't gone more than 5 minutes in the wrong direction when I checked google maps, and confirmed my error.The rest of the morning was quiet. I passed some scenic overlooks and a peaceful forest area that I stopped to take a photo of. I saw the ""stone elephant"" which is just a large erratic if I remember my geomorphology correctly. Around 9:45am, I took a break at an overlook and enjoyed a chocolate chip granola bar. I passed the horseriders camp, and kept walking... and walking. I had expected to reach the ranger station by mid morning, and it was around this time that it dawned on me that I had started at the wrong location! Through later internet research, I found out I did pretty much all of the Blue-Spring segment of the Ice-Age Trail, and additional 7 miles! By the time I reached the ranger station, I was just about spent. It was around 1:00pm, and I still had 7.5 more miles to go. I completely filled my Camelbak with water, and fortunately the trail was a lot flatter.Around 3:15pm I almost stepped on a snake. It looked like a baby massasouga rattlesnake which is endangered, but I am not a snake expert, and I did not hear a rattle. It was only a foot long, but it was thick, like it had just eaten a mouse.The remainder of the afternoon was spent in a state of heightened concern that I would not reach Shelter #1 in time. I was sure it was going to be right around the next corner for an hour. I finally was concerned enough that I put down my pack and got out the map which confirmed I hadn't reached it yet, and gave the the highway number to look for. After crossing that highway, it was a serious effort to make it up Spy Glass Hill. I finally saw the shelter at 5:45pm, managed to make my first camp dinner by 6:15pm, and settled in to sleep by 7:00pm.",,Nowhere yet,"Oct 14, Wed",0
Spaghetti Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521239,"Thursday 10/15/2015Last night was rough. I made an executive decision to sleep in the shelter. There was a bench that went around three walls and the floor was like a dirty pea gravel. I set up my Thermarest Z-Lite sleeping pad on the gravel, and tried to get comfortable. Despite my total exhaustion, I was tossing and turning all night. My hips and shoulders have never felt so bony. Fortunately, I had many fewer miles to travel today (about 6). This was partly because of shelter spacings and partly because I knew that I would be exhausted on the morning of Day 2.So I had a leisurely morning. I took in the view, got caught up on my journal (already behind on my first day), and reviewed the day's route. I was hiking just about the entire Scuppernong segment. I had a water problem early on today. I had been guzzling it down only to find I had about 1 liter left to make it to the water that was available at the Pinewoods Campground. Fortunately, just after my shelter side trail connected with the main trail, there was a sign posted for a spring, and a chance to use my new water filter.I was a bit concerned that what I found was more of a stagnant pond than a spring, but the water was clear enough, so I gave it a chance. It was good that I did, because when I finally did make it to camp, the water was under a boil order! I have chemicals to treat water, but I am not interested in testing that out unless I absolutely have to. I am hoping that a creek noted on the map tomorrow offers another resupply opportunity. Otherwise I will be rationing the 1.5 liters that I have for about 10 miles to Lapham Peak State Park.Water issues aside, the hike was good. It was challenging. At times I was barely moving forward up steep switchbacks. When I got to the campground it felt deserted. A few people gave me strange looks as they drove by. The check-in was self-done and felt like I was incriminating myself one way or the other. Either I don't register and potentially get kicked out, or pay $10 for a vehicle I don't have. I opted to fill out the form and pay $0, explaining that I was backpacking and had no vehicle. (I had already paid for this campsite and the shelter yesterday through the online reservation process).After setting up the tent successfully with a half-log for a hammer, I tried the showers. At first I was extremely disappointed to find only ice-cold water, but after resolving to suffer for the sake of sanitation, the water finally did warm up, and the only unpleasant part was pushing a button for more water every 8 seconds. Who takes 8 second showers? Someone even left some soap and shampoo for me. Dinner was Mountain House - Pasta Primavera. Not quite as good as the Beef Stroganoff, but still very good. All of the cooking / food stuff is working out really well. So that's it for now. It's another early night tonight. I hope to be asleep 1/2 hour after sunset.",,Pinewoods Campground,"Oct 15, Thu",0
Spaghetti Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521242,"Friday 10/16/2015So there was some good news and bad news from last night. The good news is the tent/sleeping gear all worked well, and I was much more comfortable on my second night. I was probably asleep by 7:30pm. However, the bad news is around 10:30pm, a pack of coyotes was howling, and they had to be closer than a half mile at that point.Throughout the night, they drifted around an area to the South and West of the campground. I'm also not 100% sure it wasn't wolves. Some of the noises were crisp barks - almost dog-like in between howls. More internet research is required there. So I didn't sleep very well in the middle portion of the night.I did my best to break camp when the sky had barely turned gray, but all of the tasks required to mobilize took me until about 7:45am. Shortly after beginning my hike, I found a convenient creek with a bench nearby to resupply my water. I was glas not to have to be concerned about rationing, and I got more practice with my water filter.Also, just starting out, still inside the campground, I saw a doe and two fawns. I tried to get a photo, but they were too far in the distance to clearly identify anything. Today had significant ""connector routes"" which means the trail dumps you on the side of the road, and you get to choose between the tall grass in the bottom of the ditch and walking right next to cars blasting through at 60mph. It wasn't too bad, but then the maps provided indicated a University of Wisconsin field station was some sort of waypoint on the trail. When I checked it out, it was a free wild animal rehabilitation center. The field station was next door, and no one was there. I had wanted to inquire about this ""Trail Pass"" which signs stated was required but did not describe how to purchase. I opted not to worry about it, and a sign later confirmed it did not apply to hikers. But the Glacial Drumlin Trail was full of users, and the road on one side and the steep slope/heavy usage made impromptu bathroom trips impractical. The entire trail today was well populated. Through random chance I managed to visit nature uninterrupted, but it was just a roll of the dice.Fortunately most people travel in pairs, and talk loudly to each other about the people making their lives difficult, and you can hear them coming. I reached Lapham Peak and enjoyed a small lunch. A lot of people were interested in what I was doing with all this backpacking gear. Some expressed interest in doing it themselves. Others just looked bewildered.A group of school kids was learning about Increase A. Lapham who played a key role in the first national weather broadcasts. After a trip up the tower, and some more gear chatter, I continued on my way. Lots of trail before passing under I-94 and into Delafield.I found a Porta-Potty at a little league baseball field. Otherwise there were no breaks till I checked in at the Holiday Inn Express. Applebee's next door for dinner. I made phone contact with my wife and confirmed our plans to meetup tomorrow when the trail is done!",,Delafield Holiday Inn Express,"Oct 16, Fri",0
Spaghetti Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521243,"Saturday, 10/17/2015Mission Accomplished! I reached my goal and completed my hike through Waukesha County. The day began in the comfortable bed of the Holiday Inn Express. It saved a lot of time filling up my water from the tap and not having to pack up a campsite. Also, the breakfast was really good, and seemed to give me the extra energy I needed to power through the cold morning. It was also down to 28 degrees overnight, so that's another reason why I am glad I was indoors.Starting out, I found my way into the golf course where the trail began. I somehow found myself on a trail veering East instead of North. I tried to find my way through the golf course, but had to pass by the clubhouse, where I was redirected off the golf course. I took the long way around and reconnected with the trail, or should I say the neighborhoods through which the largely unsigned trail ran.I was happy when I made it back into the trees. The good news is my endurance has improved dramatically. About two hours went by after the golf course when I was walking through Hartland and found myself walking next to an Ice-Age Trail Alliance meeting. They were celebrating Hartland's recognition as the first ""Ice-Age Trail Community"" in Wisconsin. Everyone was very amused that a hiker happened to be walking through at the exact moment, and I was invited to the presentation and spoke with some 1000 milers before continuing on.On the next section I saw something like a woodchuck in the river. I also saw a doe and two fawns, this time much closer, leaving the golf course. I enjoyed the parts of the trail that followed the river. The rest of the day was spent walking, just putting one foot in front of the other, trying to knock out miles.I saw the most people I have ever seen watching kids play lacrosse. They were charging $10/car and there had to be thousands of people. It looked like a state fair parking lot. I stopped and had a snack around 2:00pm, next to a railroad bridge with graffiti. Some sections of trail were a little ridiculous. There was a narrow, kind of poorly maintained footpath running right next to a beautiful paved bike trail. I guess you had to decide between the true difficult path or the counterfeit easy path. I took the true path in 2 of the 3 sections, but the third was just too poorly maintained, so I took the bike path. The last section through Monches - or the Monches Segment - was beautiful. It meandered through an open forest of trees losing their leaves. It was picturesque, and relatively easy as well. And around 4:15pm, I exited the woods, completing my journey, I am estimating I walked 52 miles in 4 days, but still need to confirm that. My wife arrived shortly after, and took me home.",,"Monches, WI","Oct 17, Sat",0
Spaghetti Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521317,"Hello! I hope you enjoyed my first journal entries that covered my Ice-Age-Trail preparation hike. I realize that my introduction was somewhat brief. I wanted to get a little substance recorded before I spent 30 days writing about my hopes and fears. Full disclosure: I am not a writer. As a civil engineer I can write detailed memo’s explaining why another $10,000 for pavement repair is justified, but my general writing skills are largely untested.I don’t think I am breaking any rules by writing this journal directly to the Trail Journals audience. While word for word transcriptions of actual journals are valuable as historical artifacts, I find them to be a bit drier than a format that acknowledges the audience. So I intend to do both, covering the facts of the day as well as my thoughts. I would skip the pre-hike entries altogether, but I think they serve a purpose to document a hiker’s personality and gear selections before the hike begins. It’s also a good way to identify the nutballs and space out your start date. I am aiming to leave just before the fattest part of the bubble, and I intend to hike painfully slowly, so there’s no avoiding this nutball.Preambles aside, I have made the dreaded notifications. I braced myself for ridicule, but did not receive any. In fact, I was overwhelmed by positive responses and offers of support. I think some people were concerned about whether this was the best thing I could be doing with my time, but I’m going to put that response under the “genuinely cares about my well-being” column.I have been told that my job will be waiting for me when I come back, so I am very thankful for that. I am assigned to a long-term project right now that could actually benefit from a temporary reduction in manpower.“…I do not see coincidence, I see providence. I see purpose.

Spaghetti Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521452,"A great trailname is given by someone else on an actual trail. It is memorable, short, easy to pronounce, related to a specific event that actually happened, summarizes your personality, is cool, and has never been used before. If starting the Appalachian trail without a trail name, one should be dreamed up and accepted within about one week max, and changed no more than one time.At least those are the rules I’ve gathered after reading journals over the last few years. Of course hitting every one of those categories is nearly impossible, but it seems like that’s the target. I’ve “accepted” the trail name “Spaghetti Legs”. It was given to me by my parents as a child while walking along the Oregon coast (sort of a trail). It is memorable, a little too long, but easy to pronounce, and related to my actual childhood beach-walking habit of collapsing to convince my Dad to carry me on his shoulders. It is sort of related to my personality, is moderately cool, and hasn’t been used on Trail Journals yet. So I like it.On a separate note, you may have been wondering about the snake I wrote about in my first journals entry, aka The Serpent of Scuppernong. My internet research indicates the snake was an Eastern Hognose Snake, also commonly known as a Puff Adder. The snake is very common (although interestingly is considered threatened in Canada). It is non-venomous to humans, but has rear facing fangs and venom that affects toads specifically. The snake is known for raising up its head and flattening its body out like a cobra and hissing. That’s what this one did, and once I saw that I was long gone. Apparently it was bluffing and almost never bites humans. The coloration varies wildly. This one just happened to have similar striping patterns to an eastern massasauga rattlesnake. Similar enough that I didn’t want to linger, anyway.Every great story seems to begin with a snake.-Nicolas Cage",,View Entry,"Feb 19, Fri",0
Spaghetti Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521524,"The saying goes, “Hike your own hike”. But we still obsess over everyone else’s hike to make sure we are not missing out on some innovative way of doing things. So, in case you’re planning to copy my hike, here’s my major gear selections and rationale for choosing them. Please bear in mind that I only have 52 miles of backpacking experience, and my knowledge is almost all theory at this point. Copy at your own risk.I’m usually not interested in taking chances on newfangled gear options or backpacking methods. I am intending my hike to be a close replica of other successful thru-hikes. I favor a lot of gear that won awards in 2011 or 2012 and was then used by successful thru-hikers over the last several years. My tent for example is a Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2. I have read that this was one of the most common tents used by thru-hikers a couple years ago. It has an extremely low weight for an actual enclosed tent. It’s about 4 pounds lighter than the one which I was graciously loaned for my October hike on the Ice Age Trail. My bag is an Osprey Atmos AG 65. I have also read this is commonly used by thru-hikers. It’s big enough for my Bear Vault 500, but that’s a story for another pre-hike entry.This is the base I started with, but I am not completely boring. My sleeping bag is a Marmot Trestles 30 Synthetic sleeping bag. This was copied from Craig (Affirm) Tsao’s gear list. He has a very helpful story of failing to close his Camelbak completely, and soaking this same model of sleeping bag. He said that even though it was wet, it still kept him warm that night. That was a big factor in choosing synthetic over down for me. It seems like most people have to sleep in a wet sleeping bag at some point, and I’d rather be warmer when that happens. I am also on the outer fringes of the temperature rating compared to other people. I have tested this out down to 35 degrees, and I was plenty warm, so I think I could handle another 15 degrees or so without being too cold. I tend to sleep at oven temperatures. Time will tell.Regarding footwear, I am also going completely against the grain and will start with the Asolo Men’s TPS 520 GV backpacking boots. I understand I’m going to look like a dayhiker out there, but I can’t stomach the idea of walking through melting snow in mostly mesh trail runners. I realize I am basically strapping on ankle weights, but boots are supposed to last longer, and these should theoretically prevent my toes from jamming against the front of my footwear on declines and my toenails falling out, which frightens me more than bears for some reason. Those are the big four. I hope it helps. “If you believe the purpose of life is to only serve yourself, then you have no purpose.

Spaghetti Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521939,"Are you an overweight hiker like me? Do you consider that an advantage or a disadvantage? The conventional recommendation is to be as physically fit as possible prior to beginning a thru-hike. There are many examples of ultra-runners and fitness gurus successfully completing a thru-hike. However, there are also plenty of cases of “plumper folk” completing a successful thru-hike, losing weight as they go. My hypothesis is this: Beginning the thru-hike with extra weight, up to 30%, increases the odds of a successful thru-hike.The reasoning is simple. Extra fat means extra energy carried as close to your core as physically possible. It means less food and therefore less weight has to be carried in a backpack to deliver the same amount of energy. This reduces the variability of pack weight which can cause injuries, especially as you climb the first mountain out of a resupply town. It also should reduce the binge eating / hiker hunger that occurs once fat reserves are depleted.It means that your body will consistently get lighter as you go, making every mile easier than the last, or at least equally difficult, factoring in the breakdown of muscles. And toward the end, your body will still be burning your fat reserves instead of disassembling muscle fibers for energy.I don’t mean to suggest that if you have a low body fat percentage that you should pig out and rapidly gain weight prior to a thru-hike. The body needs time to adjust to a greater weight and develop all of the supporting muscles, tendons, and ligaments to mobilize that extra weight. Without that time, it seems like injuries would be more likely.  Also, if you have so much extra weight that you can’t make it out of the starting gate, then obviously a successful thru-hike is not possible. But I think there’s an ideal starting fat percentage that is significantly higher than the leading theories. This theory will make the beginning of the hike much more difficult, but the middle and the end will be much easier. My Body Mass Index (BMI) of 31.1 puts me just over the overweight line and into the dreaded first “Obese” category (over 30). Now, the index is notorious for calling muscular people obese. On good self-esteem days, I like to think I have the body type of a Samoan warrior, encased in a layer of fat reserves. But whatever label you give it, it happens to be the perfect subject to test my “Obese Thru-Hiker” theory.That being said, I think there’s also a benefit to losing about 10 pounds prior to a thru-hike. As we all know, shaving 10 pounds off of pack weight only comes with compromises in comfort, safety, and hygiene. I prefer to lose that weight from my body to ensure I can get out of the starting gate. Also, getting in good cardiovascular shape and building the muscles necessary to carry a backpack are critical for all the reasons that the fitness people say. I am 6’1”, and my starting weight was 245lb. I have dropped about 9 pounds so far, and hope to drop the last pound over the next two weeks to start at 235lbs. My ideal weight is probably 185.Here’s where it gets good: At 3500 calories per pound, I can lose 1% of my body weight per week, and burn around 8000 calories a week extra at the start of my hike, down to about 6500 calories a week at the end. After 24 weeks of hiking (excluding zero days), I will be at 184.6 pounds exactly. And a supporting point from the animal kingdom: Emperor Penguins lose up to 50% of their body weight during their two or three month “thru-hikes” with no resupply points.   That means according to the Body Mass Index, they started walking when they were morbidly obese.Qualifying statement: My wife says I have a habit of making up medical facts and advice when I have no idea what I’m talking about. Please don’t pursue this plan until leading nutritionists, fitness experts, and doctors have confirmed that I am correct. Also, as part of my self-esteem plan, I am only accepting positive comments during this stage of my thru-hike. I will be accepting all negative comments during the West Virginia portion of my hike.Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better. -Albert Einstein",,View Entry,"Feb 27, Sat",0
Spaghetti Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523188,"Why?The mountains are calling, and I am answering the call. I think they’ve been calling for some time, but I didn’t understand initially. The unidentified urge probably started just after graduating college. Knowing nothing about backpacking, I felt compelled to assemble a “survival backpack”, fill it full of impractical nonsense, and keep it close by at all times. I briefly tried to set up an online camping store and quickly abandoned the effort. Then routine settled in and the desire lay dormant. Then, years later, in a travel stop in Burns Harbor, Indiana, I happened across “Hiking Through” by Paul Stutzman. It’s an Appalachian Trail memoir focusing on using the trail to get through a period of grief. I was hooked, and began reading more hiking books and found the Trail Journals website. After years of this, my wife suggested we incorporate a visit to Springer Mountain into a family visit / road trip last Memorial Day weekend. She later told me that she was hoping that I would see it and stop building it up in my head as something more than it was. Seeing Springer Mountain did nothing to decrease my focus on the Appalachian Trail. On the contrary, it made it seem possible. It became a place that could actually be reached by a real person. We decided that I needed to at least have several days of overnight backpacking experience if I was going to commit to six months of overnight backpacking. I hiked through Waukesha County (detailed earlier in this journal) on the Ice Age Trail. After reflecting, the parts of it that I enjoyed the most were the parts most like the Appalachian Trail. I liked dropping into the woods for hours of isolation, popping out at occasional scenic overlooks. There was no one moment at which the decision was made. A lot of conversations were held about desires, dreams, and logistics. It developed from a crazy plan to an optional plan to the assumed plan. All of this is to say, I don’t feel that I developed a plan to do this. I feel like the plan developed me until I was ready to say yes.Ultimately, I’m hiking to be a better version of myself. There’s a part of me that’s fearless, kind, and trusting. There’s a part of me which is extraordinarily strong and can persevere no matter the challenge. There’s a part of me that climbs mountains, sings loudly at inappropriate times and writes poems to make people laugh. There’s a part of me that makes peace and restores calm. This hike is to bring out the best parts of me. I want to endure pain and suffering without quitting. I want to face fear head on. I want to talk to God and hear the replies. I want to live as the best version of myself and live with joy.",,View Entry,"Mar 11, Fri",0
Spaghetti Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523452,"I suppose this trip began Friday afternoon. My wife and I elected to drive a rental car to Amicalola Falls State Park, stopping in Southern Illinois to take advantage of the wonderful hospitality of my brother-in-law and sister-in-law.Saturday was a long day of driving. Between the accidents on the highway which required rerouting and multiple breaks for meals, snacks, and bathroom breaks, we finally made it to the Amicalola Falls Lodge around 10:00 pm local time. The room was very nice which was good, because we weren't in the mood to hunt for another place to stay.It was a double time-zone / daylight savings time whammy this morning.      Following a buffet breakfast, the final pack was assembled and we headed over to the visitor's center where I checked in as #625 northbound. After a few tips and tricks and a short lecture on carrying too much water, I weighed my bag: 41 pounds shall I carry.A few photos were taken and some difficult goodbyes were said. My wife saw me off and visited some family in the area before catching her Atlanta flight home.My first significant obstacle was the 600 stair trip up the falls. Very scenic, very strenuous for my physical fitness level. The good news is that after an hour of artery-throbbing work, the trail became more hospitable. However, there were still some inclines that never seemed to end.I finally reached Springer Mountain's summit around 4:45pm after starting the approach trail at 11:12am. Why so late? I guess I'm slow at getting ready, and need to work on that. There was a group of about 15-20 people just relaxing at the summit. I signed the register and walked on a bit further to the camping area where I got to practice setting up camp with no picnic table or too many other luxuries.I managed to ""cook"" myself some freeze-dried pasta primavera before securing my best canister to a tree. I'm a bit nervous about this, but hope for the best. A beautiful great spring gushed from the aptly named Springer Mountain, and I resupplied my water.The weather today was absolutely perfect. I'm not sure how well I would have fared if it was thunderstorming which was predicted for today only a few days ago. It was also great to use my Crocs for the first time. They are handy camp shoes, and it was good to get out of my boots. I'm learning that the mountains take on a different personality depending on what you need. Whereas before it was the benevolent voice like Gandalf's gently urging that the song must be taken to Mordor and destroyed, today it was the voice of the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket: ""You call yourself a thru-hiker? Go over to those stairs and climb 175 of them! Done? Give me 175 more!"" I'm looking forward to tomorrow's hike. It's mostly downhill from here!","Amicalola Falls State Park

Spaghetti Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523664,"Last night was a success. The tent and all systems held. The tent was actually large enough to pack my sleeping bag and mat without exiting the tent. I got an early start, exiting camp around 8:00 am, but I went 0.2 miles back to get some more Springer Mountain photos. I left around 8:15am. It was a pleasant 4 miles of descent. I paid for it over the next four miles of steady climbing. I arrived at Hawk Mountain Shelter at 1:20pm. I called it a day hiking-wise (This was my planned stop). My intention is to take it slow and let my body adapt. Tomorrow is another short day, but includes Sassafras Mountain which has a reputation for weeding out thru-hikers.I've decided to sleep in the shelter tonight instead of tenting. I would estimate around 25 to 30 people are tenting. I have the shelter to myself! It was lively and crowded in the shelter as everyone piled in to cook and eat dinner out of the rain.

Spaghetti Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523883,"Apparently mice do like little crumbs of food. I couldn't find a comfortable position to sleep in last night. I couldn't have gotten more than 2 hours of sleep. Around 1:30 am, I was lying awake and was a dark shape scurry in front of my face, about 2 feet away. After that I was really awake. Fortunately they were mostly interested in another guy's bag who left it there to keep it dry. So, since I had the shelter to myself, I quietly got packed up. I was in the first batch of hikers to leave. Surprisingly, I think I was only passed a few times. I encountered my first bit of semi-trail magic when a guy in a ""yellow blazin'"" truck showed up and asked it I needed water. He had stockpiled a couple gallons on the other side of Sassafras mountain.Fortunately, I didn't need any since I am still insisting on taking surplus water. My legs felt a lot better on today's mountains, and it wasn't until the early afternoon that I began to get really tired. The temp was somewhere around 80 degrees today, and the you Georgia sun was only partially filtered by the trees without leaves. When I got to Hooch Mountain shelter, placed for tents were already filling up at around 2:00pm when I arrived, so despite wanting to take a nap in the shelter, I picked out a prime spot and set up my tent. I'll forego the shelter tonight.There are a lot of people here. Some are part of the big March 15th start at Springer. The shelter lots are an interesting read. If I got the story right, someone lost a black Croc. Someone else found it, thought it was theirs before realizing the mistake and hanging it in another branch with a ""sorry?"" note. The whole story wasn't revealed until reading the shelter log. That's entertainment here.A couple things so far that have surprised me: The 360 degree panorama of mountains is not captured by single photos. Also... this is very hard work. I would compare the effort of hiking 8 miles in the mountains to doing 5 hours in an elliptical machone, 3 of those at max incline, resistance level 10. Tomorrow my schedule is flexible based on how I'm feeling, hopefully inspired and with inexhaustible energy.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Partly it's the tent that helped, partly the weather was just about perfect, and partly my body has given up some of its demands to be comfortable. I used the breathe-right strips for the first time, and while effective (I'm guessing) they seemed to open a passage to a mucus underworld. My nose ran last night like no one's business. My down jacket which I was using for a pillow was more like a slip-n-slide. I solved the problem by sleeping on my ultra-absorbent camp towel.Nose drama aside, I got a lot of rest. I got packed up and was on the trail by 8:45. I said goodbye to ""Geezer"", a 70 year old thru-hiker who camped beside me and I made my way up the mountains.There were two stunning overlooks today. Pictures were taken. My phone charger has run out of juice so I am only turning the phone on to text and take photos. Reception isn't that good either, so Trail Journal entries may be delayed. The big news of the day was Trail magic near Woody Gap. Someone had everything from hot dogs to oranges to brownies. I had an orange, a brownie, and a coke. Also, since there was a trash can at this location, I got to dump all of the trash I've accumulated this week. If you want to hear something strange, about an hour away, I thought to myself, I could really use an orange right now. Multiple people had the exact same thought before unexpectedly finding trail magic oranges.My body is really adapting to mountain hiking. The experienced hikers say day 4 is about when things start to get a little easier, and for me, things were much more enjoyable today.I reached Lance Creek Campground around 2:15pm. There are very few spots here, so people are camped on top of one another and at its angles. Our cluster of tents became the common area for people to gather. There are a lot of people to meet and stories to share. I seen to be traveling at the same pace and enjoy their company. The weather has been phenomenal with sunburn being the biggest threat. Tomorrow I face Blood Mountain before reaching my intermediate goal of Neels Gap. I would rate today as my highlight of the trail so far.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

I was with Diligent and Sparkles and then Kalil and Rich who had not yet adopted the name DJ Trailmix. We hiked about an hour by headlamp up the slopes of Blood Mountain. The area we were going through was known for its high risk of bear encounters. The weather was chilly and windy enough for a down jacket. It was my first try at hiking in a group, but my natural pace is slower uphill, so I found myself falling behind. It was something like a 1600' elevation gain over about 4 miles, with little reprieve.I have officially developed a cold, which put a damper on my day. The peak of Blood Mountain had great views, and even a show-off airplane buzzing the trees near the mountain and doing a few tricks.I forgot to mention that yesterday I just left the trail magic at Woody Gap when A.T. YouTube celebrity ""Seven"" who does the hiker-trash videos was on site doing interviews for his annual Thru-Hiker videos. After making it down the steep side of Blood Mountain, there was a large group of hikers assembled at Neel Gap, most of whom has passed me earlier in the day. There was a flurry of resupply activity. Most of my former group is moving on to a campsite about a mile from here. I desperately needed a shower and laundry and the best chance at a decent night's sleep, so I elected to sign up for a bunk. There was one washing machine and dryer so I split a $5 load with Texas and Umgawa and we thoroughly reviewed each others sock and underwear preferences to avoid any misunderstandings or drafty mornings.The whole laundry process took longer than expected, so I missed my window to resupply, but I understand it opens tomorrow at 8:00am, so that's the new plan. There was some great trail magic at the hostel- Chick-Fil-A and cookies. People seen to be very generous and supportive of thru-hikers.Tomorrow's plan is to go about 11 or 12 miles, which is bigger but doable. I was relieved to finally be able to charge my phone and charger. I also took some Benadryl so that I can avoid another nasal episode. After resting for 5 or 6 hours, I'm feeling better and am hoping for a great day tomorrow.","Lance Creek Campground

From the time I walked into camp amidst the occassional ice pellet until I woke up to 1/4 inch of snow on the ground, I was gripped by a sleep preventing coldness that caused me great discomfort. Morning finally came, and the tent stakes I had driven extra deep to withstand the wind were encased in frozen clay. The positive thing that happened was that Geezer negotiated a ride out from Dicks Creek Gap to Hiawassee from Bill, a ridge runner who was headed that way, if we could be there no more than 15 minutes after Bill reached the Gap.By the time I extracted those last frozen stakes and packed up, we had about 8 buffer minutes to chase Bill about 4 miles to Dicks Creek Gap, and we weren't sure how fast this professional hiker hiked. So despite the lack of sleep (Geezer didn't fare any better in the shelter), we put in a solid effort, and with the large percentage of downhill sections, we made our ride and got breakfast & checked in at the Holiday Inn Express.There are a lot of other hikers doing something similar. A lot of us plan to zero here tomorrow as well before taking the next long segment to Hot Springs. The path is so much easier with friendly faces you can count on to watch your back.

My error wasn't so much in snoring as it was falling asleep within 15 seconds and proceeding to snore all night. My breath-right even stuck last night after I polished my nose to an industrial finish. I assure you when I briefly woke up around 1:30 am, it was like a squadron of B-52 bombers was about to take off in the shelter, so cast not the first stone! The majority of non-snorers have relocated to tents as far away from the shelter as they can get.One thing I forgot from yesterday- Rich and Kalil, who I last saw in 3/21 were at Pecks Corner Shelter last night. It's not often you run into faster hikers, so it was a treat to catch up with those guys. Also, we have met Whisperer, not to be confused with Night Whisperer. She is a doctor, possibly retired? We shared a shelter last night and tonight. There was another doctor section hiking for a few days. What a coincidence that 4 out of 5 nights in these remote Smoky Mountains, I have had a doctor within 10 feet of me. The hiking today was memorable. We woke to a bone-chilling coldness that caused us to retract into our sleeping bags. When I started hiking, it was with all the winter gear that I slept in. There was a light dusting of snow, but I think most of it was what had blown off the ice-fogged trees along the mountain ridge.I managed to get just enough water through my Camelbak to take my Claritin before the tube froze over. It was 5 miles to Tri-Corner Knob Shelter before we seemed to get on the warm (non-freezing and sunny) side of the mountain. I got the water thawed, changed out of the winter wear and proceeded on.I filtered about 4 liters of water from a pristine mountain spring. I am becoming a bit of a water snob and prefer the highest non-shelter water sources, to avoid carrying water up mountains, and to minimize the chance of contamination.

I was tucked into a corner of the shelter, which mitigated some wind, but not the dropping temperature. We woke this morning with a plan to be out and on our way by 7:30am. We left within ten minutes of that. The hiking today was long. I had my first actual fall about a mile in. The quarter inch of snow had just melted, creating a wet sheen on roots and rocks. This particular area of undulating slopes was more roots than dirt. Despite planting my pole, the network of roots formed a slide which my boot quickly slipped down. Geezer (who was just ahead of me) looked back and called it a 180 face plant. I was sprawled on the ground and fortunately found no injuries.  The rest of the day was less eventful. I found that the small basket on the end of my pole was missing, possibly due to the fall. Now it resembles more of a spear – more intimidating, but also sinking a foot deep into the mud. I hiked hard today but couldn’t catch Geezer. We failed to coordinate our lodging ahead of time, so when I arrived in Hot Springs, I spent a bunch of time calling around to find almost no vacancy, reportedly due to a big yoga convention in town.I climbed back up the hill and found a bunk at the Laughing Heart Hostel. After 18 miles, I was exhausted. I sat in a trance for a while before stumbling into the shower, which felt heavenly. Geezer, Captain Crunch and I went down to the Mountain Diner and ate our fill. A scale here says that I weigh 212 pounds, with a reported over measurement of 4 pounds, which would put me at 208 pounds for an approximate weight loss of 30 pounds.

The down side was that as my wife and I attempted to tour Asheville, NC by rental car, we got a flat tire and suffered the consequences of lowest-bidder car rental roadside assistance service. There was no spare tire in the car, but we spent an hour and a half waiting for Asheville Towing to arrive on site and inform us he wasn’t authorized to do anything but change an non-existent spare tire. Then the same service said tow truck, only to recall him 20 minutes later to take us to the Asheville Regional Airport to swap vehicles.That finally went smoothly, and we still had enough time to tour downtown Asheville and get a late lunch before returning and checking into the Hot Springs Resort.

A few broad reflections: I unexpectedly had more knowledge of the trail than a lot of people, thanks to years of reading Trail Journals mainly. The skills that I was most worried about: setting up my tent, where to put my bear canister, how to properly dispose of a fuel canister, etc..., were not that big of a deal. A little practice or theoretical knowledge is good, but things can be figured out as you go too. I am a slower hiker than almost everyone, particularly up hills, but I feel I am around the middle of the pack for people who started when I did because I haven't gotten injured and I have not gotten lured into unplanned series once in town.In summary, my performance this month has exceeded my expectations. It's harder work than I imagined, but also much more rewarding on a daily basis, and I'm doing alright. I'm not setting any records, but I'm keeping my body healthy, and I'm on a respectable pace.Today's hiking was long and hard with a lot of uphills. More wildlife was out today, with chipmunks darting behind trees and crickets so plentiful that sounded like raindrops as they bounced in the leaves and plants to the sides of the trail. There were a couple solid views, but energy was a little low toward the end of the day. I keep comparing my schedule to this theoretical 15 mile per day average, but I'm falling behind that schedule. My body is telling me it needs more time to get up to that speed, so that's the way it's going to be. Safety first. I'm looking forward to a shorter 10 mile hike tomorrow to Spivey Gap where Geezer had coordinated a visit to an old friend. I will tag along and make some new friends.It's a small group here at the camping area tonight, just four of us including Geezer and me. Strategy is the main discussion - where to resupply, how many miles to hike to hit the resupply points, where to stop each night. These are some of the bigger questions we face out here.

The breathe-rights still aren't sticking through the night, but I have changed my strategy to maximize the distance between myself and my fellow hikers.Big Bald was the highlight today. I don't recall hearing much about Big Bald, but the views were on par with those at Max Patch, and the winds were not nearly as severe. It was a shorter day, but three miles from our destination (the nearest cross road), we received trail magic, on the trail itself. Usually trail magic is located near roads, and frequently where the trail passes next to parking areas. A man met us carrying a box of donuts with a shoulder sling of oranges! He had to hike 3 miles in, up a 1067 foot mountain, and down 400 feet to meet us, while carrying a box of donuts.After he met Geezer and me, he said he was done doing trail magic, and hiked back the way he came very quickly. As we enjoyed the oranges he gave us, I contemplated the odds that a mortal man would do such a thing vs. the odds that an actual angel of the Lord would show up in disguise as a thru-hiker from 2007 to make our hike a little better. There are compelling arguments for both conclusions.Also, against all odds, we arrived at Spivey Gap around 2:50pm. Our ride arrived at 2:51pm. Geezer's friend Laura was extremely helpful to us. Despite living 45 minutes away, she picked us up, took us to Wal-Mart and an Outdoor store to resupply.

They were still deciding what to do when I decided to tent instead.The big talk around the shelter is the fire that has closed a portion of the trail about two days ahead of us and a bear who ripped apart two unoccupied tents at another shelter (somewhere we're going to pass in the next week). The trail has been rerouted and the bear shelter has been closed. People are taking bear precautions seriously as far as I can tell. However, lots of bear bags are hung from little twig-like branches that would probably break if a bear yanked on the rope.The view at Overmountain Shelter is great.

I leap-frogged with Firecracker and Kodak all day before meeting up with Geezer and Alpaca at the bottom of the mountain.With no one from the hostel answering my call, I had no idea how to get 3 miles into town, so I sent a request for heavenly assistance. 30 seconds later we found about 8 thru-hikers from 2015 doing burgers/hot dogs/beer/coke trail magic. It was great talking to them and Doc (2015) gave us a ride to Braemar Castle Hostel. 8.6 miles were hiked: 418.2 (Dennis Cove Rd.) to 426.8 (US 321).","Dennis Cove Rd

Not only did he run a tight ship, he gave us a ride to a diner for breakfast, and then from the diner to the trailhead.I felt like making a few bad decisions so I stayed up late watching Crimson Ride (after watching Red Dawn earlier). Both were on classic VHS with poor tracking. I didn't want to waste any ice cream, so that and a mountain was rounded out my bad decisions at breakfast. I didn't feel like eating anything at the diner for some reason. For the record, I had a healthy breakfast of fruit and orange juice yesterday.Geezer, Alpaca, and I stuck together for most of the day (after bunking together last night). We stopped at Vanderventer shelter, which is rumored to be haunted after a murder there in 1975. We didn't see anything unusual but water was down a steep climb, so we declined to refill there. Water was in shorter supply all day as we walked along a beautiful ridge with views in two directions most of the day. A long day of hiking later, we arrived at Iron Mountain Shelter. I think I know everyone here except one person, and I met some section hikers passing through, and a south bounder - Mountain Man who started in August in Maine and hiked through the winter.

We found them this morning about four miles away from the shelter, one experience richer, but without a mileage advantage. Scavenger is leading another night hike tonight. We told him we'll see him in the morning.Hiking today was less uphill than yesterday, which means it was about 10% easier, but still 8.5 hours of solid effort. We received a well prepared baggy of trail magic, that Geezer and I split, sitting on a bench in a gated farm field. We weren't sure what animals were being fenced in, but we were on the lookout for bulls.We past a ""disused"" shelter that looked like it might fall over at any moment. Somebody wrote ""Love Shack"" on the front so it may be disused, but is still receiving some love.I am excited to be reaching Damascus. It's such an A.T. milestone, and I can't wait to see the sign.

Another group night hiked out of the shelter last night after dinner (Samsquench, Boss, Yosamite, Patches, and Doc) for the psychological boost of only having a handful of miles into town the following day. We didn't find any night hikers sleeping on this morning. They all beat us into town.We passed into Virginia today! That's three states down. The trail itself was just about ideal hiking. It was a gently sloping downhill that did most of the work for you, without breaking knees and ankles like some steeper and rockier downhills.I was low on water, so I had to venture down a steep hill to get some with only two miles to go. I met back up with Geezer at the Damascus sign. Raw and Moose (from Kansas) took our picture for us. We did the town half mile and found just about everyone we have ever known in Mojo's Coffeehouse. I was looking for something quick and easy, so I went next door to Subway. Scavenger joined me and accepted all of the chips I couldn't finish.Geezer's wife Lee found us and they agreed to take me to Abingdon (about 15 min. away). We found my friend Katie who agreed to host me for two nights. It was a day of general relaxation after that. Showering and laundry took top priority. Then I opened up a pile of fan mail that I learned my mom orchestrated. My uncle's seventh and eighth grade students wrote letters from St. Joseph, Michigan. Those were fun to read. I also got a lot of cards and letters from family members. I won't be able to take much with me, but they were all appreciated.Katie's grandmother arrived and showed me around town. I didn't realize how historical Abingdon was. Damascus is a great trail town, so I don't think many hikers make it to Abingdon, but it is also worth seeing.We toured the lobby and halls and leaked in the ballroom of the Martha Washington hotel. We drove around to other notable sights before enjoying a hamburger, beer, and milkshake at the Soda Shoppe, a diner that used to be a drugstore. Everything has a story in Abingdon. Thru-hikers are less common here, so I am much more interesting to the people here, and they want to know all about the trip.

After homemade muffins and orange juice, it was off to Kroger to fix my calorie intake deficiency. An outfitter supplied my freeze-dried food for the next few days and CVS sold me some contact solution.Dunkin Deli made me a great sandwich. People down here are very social. Just about all work stopped for about 20 minutes in the deli as four workers asked questions about thru-hiking in between bites of my roast beef sandwich.I caught a breather and a little daytime T.V. before my 2:00 haircut. Katie is good friends with the stylist and managed to turn my appointment into a joint appointment, so we both got our hair needs addressed.A little T.V. break preceeded dinner with Katie's Grandma and uncle at the Pepper Mill. The chicken balsama was a beautiful experience. Following dinner I was also treated to a couple beers down at The Brewery where Billy Strings was playing. There was a guitar, banjo, and bass player. I would call it bluegrass music on steroids, basically lots of instrumental solos played extremely well mixed into bluegrass music.The group was much better than a warehouse down by the railroad tracks would indicate, and the place was packed. I had a lot of fun and got a feel for the Abingdon way of life. I should also mention Katie and I visited the Art Center and met a woman doing some really interesting three dimensional tapestries. If you're interested in something that's part fabric and part sculpture, I encourage you to check it out.Thanks to excellent call reception in Abingdon, I managed to call home for the second night in a row. It's always a morale boost to hear my wife's voice. Then I watched a generic crime show on T.V. I don't want to ruin it, but the killer is the former Mexican priest, working as a security guard, who lost his son in an earthquake and is bitter that an American boy survived.

My ride came and I said goodbye to Katie. Her uncle Rusty drove me to Damascus, and dropped me off at an outfitter where I got some fuel (The last item on my mental resupply list). Then I realized I forgot my hiking poles back in Abingdon! A quick call to Katie got them from the bedroom to the outside porch, and then I called Geezer and he agreed to reroute through Abingdon and pick them up for me! It was an extra 10 or 15 minutes to their trip, and I really appreciate the favor. Now I owe him and I'm sure he'll remind me the next time one of us has to carry trail magic trash.We met up at Mojo's Coffeehouse. I enjoyed the shrimp and grits, and enjoyed the company of Geezer's wife Lee and their friends Theresa and Max. Geezer had a couple errands to run to complete his resupply. We saw Rich there. Kalil is now done with his section hike, but Rich is just a little bit behind us. He was the third person I knew with identical boots, but he swapped them out because after 300 miles he finally got a blister. It was good to see him. He's always a burst of personality.We also saw Scavenger. He's taking a double zero in Damascus today because he got dehydrated hiking through the relatively waterless area south of Damascus while night hiking. I'm sure he'll be back with us in no time.We didn't hike that far out of Damascus today. Geezer would have pushed on, but I just wasn't feeling it. I called it a day at Saunders shelter. It's just the two of us and a billion gnats. We're chance-ing the shelter tonight.

Our best guess is that this is some sort of raccoon game.We saw plenty of southbound section hikers today, but no northbound thru-hikers until we stopped at the first shelter and found Raw and Moose hanging out while drying their gear. We found out the reason we didn't see anyone last night is that most people either intentionally or unintentionally stuck to the Virginia Creeper Trail, which is a 1% grade gravel path that used to be a railroad. It runs parallel to the trail, and a minor detour adds to the confusion by utilizing another portion of it, not normally a part of the A.T. Basically, you have to opt for the more difficult trail, and then follow a 10 step detour to get off and back on the more difficult trail.It was a 2000 foot climb up to Buzzard Rock. The views there were spectacular, but we were largely out of steam. We stopped at a campsite just beyond a pretty decent water source.

At least I'm staying hydrated!It was Saturday in Grayson Highlands State Park. If it was a movie, it would be called: ""Dawn of the Muggles: Pony Mountain"". Muggle is an affectionate term I've heard used for dayhiker, and they were everywhere, typically in packs of 10, mostly too nervous to make prolonged eye contact with thru-hikers.Before I saw any ponies, I saw several bulls. First I saw one just before going through a gate, on my side of the fence! Then I saw three more on the side I just entered. Thankfully, I wasn't wearing my red rain jacket yet, and I escaped down the trail.The Grayson Highlands were beautiful, and I saw quite a few wild ponies, some up close. I saw a sign that said petting the ponies can result in a fine, so if you're asking, I don't recall. Wise Shelter tempted me to stay, but it was within the limits of the state park. U.S. Forest Service representatives were actively enforcing the many rules nailed to the shelter walls and discussing ways to more effectively display their list of rules. Suddenly I found the energy to hike on. It's not that I'm a rulebreaker by nature, but I think selective enforcement is the oil which allows the machinery of society to function most efficiently. So, although the ponies were cool, I found myself stressed out by people and the state park. Moose and Raw seem to be the only familiar faces we see daily now. We can't seem to get on the same pace as anyone we know. But to wrap up the day, we found ourselves some trail magic providing dinner, Mountain Dew, and beer.I guess these guys started doing this 10 years ago, just looking for a free campsite and unwittingly set up by the A.T. When they found the thru-hikers drank all their beer, they found out about trail magic, and decided to keep doing it. It was tough to leave, but we did.

When people showed up soaked to the bone, trying to get warm in a 40 degree shelter, dry clothes were shared.Two guys went back almost two miles just to make sure another hiker was okay.

Prior to the mountain, I passed the Keffer Oak, a very large oak tree, and the second biggest on the trail. The mountain was nice and steep, but the real problem was the periodic rain/mist/fog making everything slippery. There was a three mile section surrounding the Eastern Continental Divide (Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico) that I thought was the most dangerous part of the trail yet.The rock face formed a slanted slope, occasionally ending in mud and thorn bushes, occasionally just continuing at that same slope for another hundred feet. There was no guaranteed safe place to step, especially with more slippery boots.I took it slow and didn't fall, but it was slow and tiring. I made it to the shelter and enjoyed dinner with Terrible Lizard, Joker, Less Mayo, Smiley, and Alpaca.

Aside from that, I slept well enough. I didn't stay up as late, and got out of camp by 10:00am. I had fewer miles to go, so I chose a slower start. The trail today still had its climbs, but it was a little gentler, with lots of pine needles to cushion the feet. 
The Audie Murphy monument was worth the side trip. He was the most decorated World War II veteran, and died in a plane crash near that spot. I also managed to make a few texts to let people know where I was and coordinate tomorrow morning's meet up with Geezer.
I stopped for a nice break at Trout Creek and met several people, including Tucker who came in second place in the Appalachian Trials competition, and who has a blog there.

There was a fair amount of traffic, and I read some horror story about a thru-hiker that fell off and injured her back a couple years ago.The descent was challenging enough: lots of hands on rocks instead of poles. There were moments with steeper dropoffs, and I wouldn't want to do it in the rain, but I always felt like there was a way to semi-safely go down. There were even some rebar steps in a couple spots. My original plan was to leave Geezer at the parking lot where he left a car and continue on to the next shelter, but the draw of food and comfort was too strong.

I'm not sure how sustainable the plan is, but we'll take it one day at a time.Unfortunately, road crossings and parking areas dictate the type of assistance required, leaving very little flexibility. Reflecting on the 1/3 complete milestone, it is daunting to think of repeating the experience two more times, but I'm proud of the effort and the miles that I've completed.

And I don't see why the machines would have enlarged them.Geezer opted out of today's hike, perhaps rethinking things after The Matrix, perhaps just needing more rest.

I finally pared down some contingency items I've been carrying since Springer. Leaner and meaner is my new style, more out of necessity than anything else.There were some ups and downs today, nothing dramatic. I found Chicken Feet, Raw, Moose, and Wander at Elkwallow wayside. I said farewell to daytime cooking/ real food by ordering a cheeseburger, fries, and blackberry ice cream.Raw and Moose are back on the trail after taking some time off, so it was good to see them. David and Sara were seeing a doctor in Pennsylvania, so hopefully it's not too serious.In the last hour of the day, I saw five bears (a mother with two cubs, and then a mother/cub combo walking down the blue blazed trail to the shelter). The experience of seeing these bears is so peaceful. There seems to be an unspoken truce that nobody gets too close to the other species and no one gets hurt.

By Bake Oven Knob Shelter, I was out of options and attempted to use my plastic hand shovel for only the second time this hike. The shovel was worthless in the Pennsylvania rocks, so I did the best I could with rock relocations. If this was too much information, blame Pennsylvania. I was not feeling poetic about the experience.I made it to the next shelter which I ultimately shared with Bird (flip-flopper) and Pebbles & Odie 2.0 hammocking / tenting nearby.

I stopped into a convenience store and on my way out met Steve, a hiker who drove me about 20 minutes to the trailhead. Thank you!The mission for the day was Mt.

I stopped in at Lonesome Lake Hut and got leftover pancakes and eggs. I then got asked to do dishes and washed breakfast dishes for about 15 minutes.Getting up and over Kinsman Mountain was challenging but with a light daypack didn't feel overwhelming. I'm getting a feel for the difficulty level of The Whites.It started raining lightly around noon, and around 3:00pm, it started into a steady rain. I was surprised by some of the deep mud, and some submerged boards that I had to feel with poles to avoid going thigh deep into a swamp (like Little Debbie). Wet rocks and roots were a consistent challenge. I flipflopped a bit with T3 and Shiv. When we got back to Kinsman Notch, they split the remaining 3 cookies and 3 cans of pop in a trail magic cooler with me.

Spaghetti Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552513,"All is well. In case you were wondering, I made it safely back to the Chicago area, and have completed a move to northwest Indiana. I have enjoyed reading all the comments on this journal page, and wanted to write something earlier, but I have written draft after draft in my mind and I never seem to be able to write the epic conclusion that I want to. But, there comes a point when you’ve got to say a few things, even if it’s not written as well as you hoped.Firstly, thank you to everyone who contributed to my successful thru-hike. My wife could not have shown more support as I walked off into the woods leaving her to fend for herself (and me) for six months. My Mom and Dad set up a mission command post, coordinated morale boosting letters of support, and monitored my progress hour by hour from Oregon. Geezer and Lee were pillars of support. Their generosity and hospitality made the hike so much better for my first thousand miles. Countless others contributed in big and small ways. I tried to acknowledge some of it in my journal. Thank you to you all!One thing I did to help myself verbalize my thoughts was to ask myself typical questions and then answer those specific questions. I would use a terrible British accent (with hints of Australian, Irish, Scottish, and perhaps some Bostonian) and ask myself probing questions about my hiking experience. So try to imagine the questions being asked with an accent on a British talk show with a studio audience:“Congratulations, Spaghetti Legs. What adventure is next?”Well, this is it for a long time. While I enjoyed the experience, normal life can be more than enough adventure, and I’m looking forward to it.“Well said. What was your favourite part of the hike?”        Choosing any one part is difficult. I loved the feeling of freedom as I headed out for a three or four day segment. I loved how much joy I felt from simple things like a shower and clean clothes. I loved zero days, camp fires, hearing thunder storms rage from the comfort of a shelter, the views, the kindness of complete strangers, and the sense of community with fellow thru-hikers. I loved being able to eat whatever I wanted for six months and losing weight anyway. I loved feeling like God was personally watching out for me and wanted me to succeed.“And your least favourite?”        Category 4 and 5 bowel emergencies have to be somewhere near the top of this list. Waking up to mice crawling on me, packing up a wet tent and hiking in the rain, and the pure physical pain of it would be close contenders. Intense heat, lack of water, bone-chilling cold, mosquitoes, deer flies, gnats that insisted on flying into eyeballs…“Whoa, that’s a lot of least favourites. Didn’t you enjoy your hike?”        I enjoyed parts of it and didn’t enjoy others. But I didn’t hike with the intention of enjoying myself all of the time, so I wasn’t disappointed. If you begin this hike without an expectation of significant hardships, the trail will disappoint you greatly. The experience is meaningful because of its difficulty and dangerousness.“Would you recommend other people attempt a thru-hike?”        I wouldn’t encourage anyone to do it if they were only half-heartedly interested in the attempt. I would recommend it to anyone who feels the unexplainable urge to do it. The likelihood of dying in the attempt is low, but the likelihood of being injured is high. Some injuries are permanent and some require surgery to correct. Some require weeks of rest and recovery. It has to be worth taking that chance.“Did you ever get sick or injured?”Not to any significant degree. There were periods where I felt I had very little energy and was struggling over flat terrain to do 12 or 13 miles. It’s possible I was a little under the weather at those times. In the first five days, I think I was getting heat exhaustion. It was 70 degrees or so and I wasn’t used to the intense Southern sun. I made the mistake of laying down in my tent in the afternoon which raised the temperature another 20 degrees or so. I never got a blister my entire trip. When my feet got soaked in Shenandoah National Park, some skin rubbed off and my feet got this weird rash. I think my toenail gouged the adjacent toe a couple times and I had to separate them with a band-aid. My feet would occasionally get shooting pain, which I was told was associated with the tendons and the skin being stretched as the feet grew. It was bearable. I had the most trouble with water from wells. I don’t know if it was the high iron and sulfur content or if the wells were more prone to contamination.“I know that you did extensive amounts of research prior to beginning your hike. After all that, what surprised you most?”        I think initially it was the feeling. The photos and videos don’t accurately portray the 360 degree panorama around you, especially in the beginning before the trees get their leaves. Also, the effort to hike even ten to twelve miles initially in the Georgia and North Carolina mountains was significantly greater than I imagined.“What did you do differently than other thru-hikers?”         I wore heavy Asolo leather boots while most hikers wore semi-disposable hiking shoes. I wore long pants for all except two days in mid-March when I got hot and then couldn’t get my zip-off pants to zip back together. I started out with a Camelbak 3 liter bladder and a Katadyn Pro pump water filter, before switching to a Sawyer Squeeze water filter in Waynesboro, Virginia and filling two bottles. My pack was definitely larger (and heavier) than average (Osprey Atmos 65L). The standard pack seemed to be the Osprey Exos 58L I think. I used a 30 degree sleeping bag the entire time whereas most people used a winter bag and some sort of summer system. I ate freeze-dried food almost every dinner outside of towns whereas everyone else survived on tortilla shells, peanut butter, tuna packets, ramen noodles, and instant mashed potatoes. I lost more weight than just about every hiker. I was closer to a “purist” than most hikers, and ended up hiking the entire thing according to that standard. I carried a bear canister (the big one) the entire way, which almost no one else did. I didn’t carry a lighter and never started a campfire, although I did assist other people starting a fire. I never used the postal system, aside from receiving letters at two locations while staying with friends and family. The reason I was able to do that was that my wife visited me about six times and hand delivered things during those visits. I also kept a journal and posted entries for each day to Trail Journals.“It sounds like you really marched to the beat of your own drum. Did you intend to do everything your own way?”        Actually, in most of my preparation, I intended to copy everyone else and be a clone of the standard thru-hiker, but I obviously did not succeed. The boots were a compromise between family members who were concerned about rattlesnake bites, and they ended up saving me a lot of money because I wore the same pair the entire hike. I was more concerned about tick bites and mosquito bites than overheating, so that explains the pants. I wish I had started with the Sawyer Squeeze (standard, not mini). I thought the pump would be more practical for puddles of water, but there wasn’t a situation that the Sawyer Squeeze couldn’t handle eventually. Most of the time it was much faster and much less effort and allowed you to get out of the way of a queue of people at a good water spot. I got the larger pack to fit my bear canister, which was overkill for the Appalachian Trail, but would be necessary on other trails around the United States, and proved resistant to mice and other critters as well. It wasn’t a bad choice, but if I wanted to cut weight I’d start there. I stopped using the Camelbak bladder around 600 miles in. It was just such a production to fill it, close it tight, and get it in and out of the pack. Once I was confident I could survive on two liters of water, I used a Nalgene bottle and a Mountain Dew bottle, and that system worked fine for me. Some people screwed the filter directly to their water bottle and sucked through the filter. The Nalgene was extra weight, and it probably makes more sense to use two disposable bottles, but I didn’t. I used the Sawyer bag to haul an additional three liters through dry sections occasionally. The sleeping bag probably caused me the most discomfort per dollar saved of all of my gear choices. I would absolutely spend the money on a high quality 10 degree bag until mid May and then perhaps a 40 degree bag until switching back for the White Mountains. I’m pretty sure I shivered off at least 15 pounds the first month. The freeze-dried food was a budget buster, but it was such a streamlined system, and allowed me to carry just a 1 pint cup for boiling water. My cooking setup was ultralight, and I looked forward to dinner every night. I also bought as I went along, so I didn’t have to worry about Post Office hours, although many towns had only limited quantities of freeze-dried food.“Please tell me you’re going to go into more detail with your gear selections.”        Yes, I intend to go a little more in depth for some of the more major gear items. I want to provide a point of view for next year’s thru-hikers.“Obviously future thru-hikers are going to gain something from reading your journal, but who was your primary target audience?”        I did write the journal and post it with the intention of paying forward the help I received online by helping future thru-hikers. I also wanted to give family and friends who were interested a way of finding out how my hike was going. But I think my target audience was someone who just enjoys reading about an adventure. Not everyone is in a position to quit their job and head to the mountains for six months. I wanted to give those people a means to vicariously experience an Appalachian Trail thru-hike.“Well, unfortunately we’re running out of time. Promise me we’ll talk again.”        I would like that very much.",,View Entry,"Dec 18, Sun",0
Spaghetti Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555120,"“Welcome back Spaghetti Legs. Due to the overwhelming response we had from our first interview with you, our producers have invited you back for a follow-up interview.”Thank you. I’m glad to be here.“What our audience wants to know is, how did you really mess up, and what advice would you give to future thru-hikers?”There are a lot of ways to mess up on the trail. Whatever flaws you have as a human being will become magnified on the trail. I found out that I have a hard time paring down my gear. I carried far too much for far too long. I imagined I would be duct taping my feet every night, so I took about 10 feet of duct tape, wrapped around a piece of cardboard. 5 feet of that I finally put in a hiker box in Luray Virginia. I gave away the last 5 feet two days before the end to a hiker whose shoes were falling apart, and even then, I had a hard time getting rid of it.I imagined all sorts of outlandish scenarios in which I was stranded by myself and forced to start about 40 fires with waterproof matches. I never used a single match but carried that waterproof container of matches every step of the way. I also carried a heavy backup magnesium striking fire starter kit all the way to Luray, Virginia.My first-aid kit was a huge extra weight. I had enough first aid to open a small clinic for the lacerated and impaled. And so did almost everyone else. The official first-aid bag which carried everything probably weighed more than necessary, and then weighed more when various products leaked all over the bag. The reality is you only need enough first aid to make it four days. You don’t need 20 band-aids or multiple types of gauze. One roll of something is more than I ever saw used on the trail. I also had over-the-counter medications. I never popped a single pain pill, but I realize I was out of the norm there. “This advice seems pretty standard. Why would you say more people don’t follow it?”The saying goes, “You pack your fears”. You will also end up packing the fears of everyone who cares about you. If you’re blessed with some sort of support system while you’re on your thru-hike, the price of that support system is listening to their well-intentioned advice about planning for contingencies. Before you begin your hike they will lay awake imagining the horrific ways you could die and they will find the gadgets that they want you to carry to mitigate that risk. You will not be able to explain that the lighter your load the safer you are. So take the knick knacks and paddywacks and thank them for thinking of your needs. Hike with them four or five days to Neels Gap, say a few words of thanks, and lay them to rest in the hiker box. Yes, even the gadgets you promised to carry all the way to Katahdin. If you feel guilty remember that the weight of all those items added up will blow out your knee, compress your spine, and prematurely age you six years. That’s a fact, at least potentially. “Quite a bleak picture indeed. Is there anything unusual you would recommend then?”Accumulate friends or at least positive interactions with as many hikers as possible. Friends don’t weigh anything unless you have to carry them, which is worth the risk, because they are equally likely to have to carry you. There are going to be plenty of people who take everything but the kitchen sink, and are going to be delighted when you actually need it 600 miles from Springer Mountain and they can lighten their load a bit. The trail community can be a large network of friendly people if you adhere to the basics of common sense. “To switch gears a bit, you wrote some rather groundbreaking theories about, shall we say, the plumper hiker. How did your theories hold up on the trail?”I was a little off, but not outrageously off. One interesting thing I noticed is that in the beginning, everyone hikes until they are not comfortable hiking anymore and then they stop for the night. For a person that’s out of shape, this comes much quicker, which has a protective effect on the knees and feet which are getting used to the miles. I may have been noticing the things that supported my approach to the trail, but it seemed like a higher percentage of physically fit people experienced knee and foot problems early on, because they weren’t out of shape enough to want to stop at a reasonable interval. There were plenty of physically fit people who did the large miles right out of the gate and had no problems, so until the statisticians get involved, I would take my experience with a grain of salt.Socially, it was a bit frustrating to always feel like I was averaging one to two miles less per day. People I enjoyed hiking around drifted farther and farther up the trail, while I was stuck reading their shelter logs. But the area where I feel I was surprisingly right was the last third of the trail, particularly New Hampshire and Maine. It seemed like everyone was either running out of gas or didn’t want the trail to end, but I was finally doing more miles and catching up to people in the hardest sections of the trail. I attribute that to having fat reserves left to burn. There comes a point when you just can’t consume enough calories to go the distance you need to go, so if your fat reserves are depleted you are basically limited to the energy output derived from pop-tarts and peanut butter. “So how exactly would you modify your theory?”I would say if you’re in the process of trimming down, being about 20% over your target weight makes sense in terms of fat reserves, but if possible, be in good enough shape to hike 15 miles a day with a full pack in the mountains without too much pain. This isn’t mandatory for a successful thru-hike, but seems like it should increase the odds of success. It will also reduce the cost of your hike, because you will be able to finish in closer to 5 months rather than 6 months.“What about your thru-hike are you most proud of?”I’ve given this question a lot of thought. I’m proud of the fact that my body held together for 2200 miles. I’m also proud that I didn’t yellow blaze or even blue blaze (although I did slackpack and sometimes in the reverse direction which is “unclean” according to some definitions of purist). There’s a fine line between a purist and someone with obsessive compulsive disorder, but I think I stayed on the right side of that line. I’m most proud of the fact that I tried. It wasn’t easy to tell my wife I was going to leave her for six months or quit a perfectly good job. It wasn’t easy to spend a bunch of money on expensive gear without knowing if I would even like backpacking. I had months of waffling and plenty of opportunities to gracefully back out. But I didn’t. I chose to spend my valuable time, money, and perhaps my health pursuing a dream. Even if I had sprained my ankle on the approach trail stairs and had to go home on the first day, I would still be proud that I tried. To live proactively is a scary thing because it means you are responsible if things go wrong. The alternative is to safely go from crisis to crisis with someone else to blame.“What do you say to those people who say you really just hiked the trail to conduct secret government research about our national migratory capabilities through mountainous terrain in the event of some national emergency?”If that was true, then it wouldn’t be a secret if I talked about it.“Obviously it’s not true… But suppose it was true, what would you say you learned?”The mountains are relatively inhospitable to pedestrian movements, but well maintained trails are feasible for certain volumes of hikers in semi-decent shape. The right hiker gear is essential. Well supplied towns including some with outfitters at regular intervals are critical. A functioning postal service is a big help. Capacity is effectively limited by practical sleeping / tenting locations near the trail but particularly in the vicinity of water sources. In perfect circumstances, with the right gear and well supplied resupply opportunities, and the majority of the population choosing other migratory routes, well maintained mountain trails could be a feasible and perhaps preferable means of cross country travel in an emergency situation. I would expect the quality of the trails to drop off dramatically with a spike in usage. Privies are not designed for sudden surges in usage. Water sources are more prone to contamination with inexperienced hikers. In summary, it would have to be a near end of the world situation for it to be a good idea to use mountain trails to hike across the country to evacuate from some emergency situation. Even then, there could be little to no transport of possessions. A family might manage thirty to forty pounds of small possessions beyond the essentials for survival.“Spaghetti Legs, I have no doubt that those that find it relevant are captivated by this analysis.

Spaghetti Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579553,"I have a couple drafts started, but I’m starting another one for this journal entry to try to get out some thoughts that may be important for hiking safety.  We’ll save phony interviews with myself for another day.  What I’m bringing up are important safety tips I learned that somehow weren’t addressed in detail in my personal pre-hike research.

GPS Locators:  A solid fraction of hikers will carry one of these.  I never met a hiker who admitted to actually wanting to carry one, but these were generally a condition of the hike imposed by loved ones back home.  I never heard of anyone utilizing the emergency beacon feature, and they probably caused more distress to loved ones when hikers would forget to send a signal to indicate they were ok.  I accomplished almost the same thing with a smartphone and Verizon service.  Verizon had the best service in 2016, although occasionally AT&T had a better signal, and there was the isolated time or two in six months that T-Mobile had service and no one else did.  I simply sent a text message from the top of a mountain that everything was fine and I listed my milepost.  I was able to send at least a simple one line text at some point of the day during all but a handful of days on the hike.  Recommendation:  Don’t use the GPS locators.

Determining if you’re lost:  I embrace technology reluctantly, and am hesitant to utilize apps if I have to agree to distribute all of my personal information to an infinite number of third party vendors.  By simply typing in maps.google.com into the google search browser, you can zoom in on your position and if you zoom in far enough, you can see the Appalachian Trail.  If your dot is not on the line, you are off the trail.  I used this several times to confirm my suspicions that I had left the trail.  It’s hard to say if I might have assumed I was on the trail and gotten myself much more off the trail than I was.  I thought this was universal knowledge, but talked to several hikers who were not aware, so there’s your technology minute, perhaps seven years behind the times.  It might just save your life.

Cell Phone Battery:  On a related note, don’t run out of battery for your cell phone.  You can accomplish this by either only turning on your phone to make calls and perhaps take the occasional photo, or by bringing along a heavy reserve battery, or both.  I recommend both, but I’m not an ultralighter.  I will say I utilized my reserve battery the entire hike, so let that speak for itself.  On a related note to the related note, I started out always using a waterproof plastic case for my phone because I was sure I was going to fall into every trickling creek.  After the first five hundred miles, I only put my phone in the case if it was starting to rain or if I was crossing a river.  But keep your phone dry.  A lot of people put their phone in something waterproof in their backpack.  I had my phone in my pocket, ready to use when I saw a good photo op.  I think it’s important to be able to access your phone quickly, but to each their own.

Cooking:  I touched on this before, but it bears repeating.  Keep your legs out from under the picnic table if possible.  I didn’t follow this myself but definitely should have.  When you’re not hiking, most of your waking moments will be spent gathered around a picnic table boiling water.  Because of the extremely flimsy nature of the tripods that support the pots, the unpredictable stability of the picnic tables, the beginner pyromaniacs pretending they know how to use their alcohol stoves, and the exhausted nature of the hikers doing the cooking, minimize the threat of boiling water spilling on your legs or burning pools of alcohol spilling onto your nylon hiking pants by sitting with your legs to the side or stand while doing your cooking.

Forest Fires:  This is probably the greatest threat that you have a real chance to mitigate.  For those urban and suburban dwellers who are used to fires being routinely responded to by fire departments and extinguished or at least contained promptly, there is some surprise that dry and windy conditions can result in forest fires rapidly going out of control, even jumping fire lines.  Several days in front of me, a forest fire nearly killed about 20 thru-hikers.  I wasn’t there, but they were reportedly within sight of flames and were running to avoid being burned alive.  And they were being guided by a forest service person to get to a safe crossroad.  I never met a forest service or park service representative who wasn’t well intentioned, but information flows slowly in the mountains, and fire moves quickly.  What could have been a foolproof hiker evacuation plan an hour ago could be a march into inescapable fire an hour later.  And thru-hiking confuses your brain to the point where being burned alive doesn’t seem nearly as much of a threat as falling behind your friends who have all decided to have an adventure and disregard warnings.  My advice is if there is a forest fire in the area, and trails are being closed, take a break.  Hitch a ride to the nearest town and hang out for a few days.  The trail will still be there when you get back, and everyone will have a better idea of what’s going on and where it’s safe to hike.

Serial Killers:  I never encountered any of these on my hike (to my knowledge), so my tips are purely theoretical.  I did fairly extensive research on violence on the Appalachian Trail because I had a disproportionate fear of violence on the trail.  I was surprised that many hikers were surprised to find out they were sleeping at shelters where murders had occurred and/or where there were rumors of shelters being haunted.  I advise learning a basic history of violence on the trail and avoiding lingering at these places if you find yourself either alone or in the presence of creepy people.  Grouping up in groups of three or more increases safety.  Hike with the bubble, and keep an eye on the shelter logs.  If there’s a guy in a red jacket who comes around sharpening his knife and talking about how his wife just left him, that’s something that’s useful to read in a shelter log before he shows up.  It will also be important to assess people’s threat level.  Men traveling by themselves should raise the threat level one notch (I was one of them, so I can say that).  Men who don’t seem to be able to or don’t want to engage others socially are higher up the threat list.  Watch for any sign of instability including but not limited to drug problems, anger issues, job loss, no money, relationship trouble, etc…  Put a special red flag on anyone who claims to be a thru-hiker but is obviously not like if they’re in Virginia and don’t know how to put up their tent yet, anybody who has stolen any of their gear, anyone compulsively lying to impress people, or any hikers with no particular ambition to hike forward (excluding SOBO’s – You may want to red flag them, but they’re going the wrong way on purpose. HA!).  You will find a dozen hikers that check off most of these boxes for every one that is actually a threat, but it’s ok to be a little judgmental when your life is on the line.  I never encountered a suspicious SOBO.  The White Mountains weeded them all out.  
Guns:  I only saw one hiker with a gun, although I heard other hikers had them at the start of their hike.  Any gun with the power to stop a bear is way too heavy to carry.  Even if you could navigate the sea of permits and licenses to legally carry a firearm on a thru-hike, I would strongly advise against it.  When everyone is shaving off ounces you will be willingly adding the weight of a child’s bowling ball to your backpack and lugging it up and down mountains.  
Lightning:  Of all the obscure threats, lightning was one of the few things that actually injured hikers in the 2016 hiking season.  I didn’t hear of any direct hits, but I heard accounts of people who were shocked by lightning as it hit a nearby tree and traveled through the ground.  It’s not to be taken lightly.  For weather forecasts, I typed in weather underground into my phone, and then whatever town was closest to me.  If I had a cell signal, I could get hour by hour forecasts of temperature and precipitation and any thunderstorm or other severe weather warnings.  Subtract three degrees for every thousand feet you are above that town.  I avoided being out in thunderstorms by planning zero days for bad weather and making sure I was in a shelter before thunderstorms were forecast to start if at all possible.  There was another weather service that claimed to give weather forecasts for each shelter on the trail, but I found the forecasts to be frustratingly vague.  Just about every forecast ranged from a 30% to 70% chance of precipitation with a 20 degree temperature range.  The hourly forecasts from Weather Underground definitely helped me to stay dry on several occasions.

Bears:  Bears follow the vegetation, so in mid-March, when there is naught a blade of grass near the trail, there will be no bears.  If they do wake up, they will be down at lower elevations near lakes and streams, not on the mountain ridges.  Generally, the bears do not want any trouble.  If you leave them alone they will leave you alone.  Instances where that was not true:  A hiker’s small dog who was off leash barked at a bear and that bear chased the dog (They use dogs to hunt bears in some areas of the trail).  I never heard of a bear approaching a shelter at night when it was full of hikers, despite a guarantee of seven or eight food bags hung up within easy reach.  The bear attacks that I did hear of were related to hikers keeping food in their tents, or smothering themselves in coconut oil (possibly a myth).  They frequently happened in low lying areas that were frequented by locals – Think campground around a lake that the trail passes by.  A couple bears figured out that hikers carried food and exhibited some crafty stalking type behavior.  That’s probably the biggest threat- the smart bears, and the ones accustomed to dayhikers dropping their packs and running.  But even the smart bears seem to realize it’s bad news if they attack humans.  That being said, don’t get between a mother and her cubs, particularly the really young ones.  The ones that are one or two years old hang out within visual range of their mom but she gives them a bit of latitude to figure things out on their own.  Avoid a situation where it looks like you’ve backed the cub into a corner.  Weird things happen.  I found myself directly under a mama bear above me in a tree who growled at me with her cubs nearby who just looked at me like “Oooooh, she’s mad now… You’re gonna get it…”

Snakes:  There are poisonous snakes on the trail, mainly rattlesnakes and copperheads.  For the sheer quantity of hikers that encountered these snakes, there should have been at least one snake bite, but I never heard of a single bite, which means that they truly are not looking to start a fight.  Be alert and don’t step on one.  They could misinterpret that.  I heard of more dog bites (1) than snake bites.  I encountered a couple of Japanese dayhikers who were petrified of a big black snake on the trail and turned around and took an entirely different side trail, which is logical only if you don’t know which snakes are venomous. 
Bees/Wasps/Hornets:  There were more people injured by one hornet’s nest than all of the other animal related injuries combined.  It happened to drop right onto the trail and everyone who walked by encountered a swarm of hornets.  Now word travels fast about calamities like this, and notepad messages were left on the trail as warnings, but this could have been a fatality for someone who was allergic.

Water filtration:  Most things on the trail you can learn over time, but to complete a thru-hike, it’s best to start out when it’s a little chilly, which means risking freezing temperatures.  So you need to know right away, don’t let your water filters freeze.  Put those filters in your sleeping bag overnight when it’s anywhere close to freezing.  Yes, it’s uncomfortable to snuggle with a clammy piece of plastic.  But, otherwise the water will turn to ice and expand the pores used to filter out the bacteria and whatnot.  There’s no fix and no way of knowing for sure if your filter is broken, so you will take each sip after that not knowing if you have a gut bursting parasite entering your system until you shell out fifty dollars for a new filter.  Also, please don’t wash your dishes at a water source.  It’s nasty to drink someone’s mashed potato water, even if it’s filtered.  Utilize the rock and leaf technique if one hasn’t been set up to establish a flow of water up above the pool of water if at all possible.  Only dip your sawyer bag if you have to.

Lyme Disease:  This is perhaps the most consistent threat on the trail.  Ticks bite and leave a variety of diseases behind.  Lyme disease causes extreme fatigue and can cause permanent harm if not treated with super strong antibiotics that have side effects that are severe enough to prevent hiking themselves.  I wore pants most of the hike, even in extreme heat.  Mosquitoes and flies are very annoying on exposed skin.  Almost every other hiker elected for the short shorts.  A Washington D.C. security guard said to one male A.T. hiker touring the Smithsonian Museum, “I’m not even going to search you.  I know you’re not hiding anything”.  The hiker happened to be sporting the shortest of shorts which are more like two fluttering silk handkerchiefs than a pair of shorts.  I heard a convincing theory that taking a lot of off-trail trips deep into the brush for a bathroom break increases your odds of a tick bite.  I preferred privies and the more standard diseases derived there to the types transmitted by ticks.  Since female hikers are exposed more frequently and completely for their trips into nature, it might be worth considering to avoid wading into brushy areas with tall vegetation if at all possible.  There are some medical studies regarding differences in the way men and women respond to lyme disease, but empirically, it seemed like a higher proportion of the female hikers at least recognized and sought treatment for the symptoms.   300,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, and most of those people are just going outside to move their sprinkler around, so I imagine the risk is higher by living outside for six months.

Meth Labs:  Yesterday’s stills are today’s meth labs.  I didn’t realize it at the time, but on my first day on the trail, I hiked with a very pleasant couple that was most likely hauling in supplies to cook meth.  The guy had to have about 100 pounds of pack weight, and he was hiking like he did it for a living but had the Breaking Bad look including the meth molecule tattoo (I knew college chemistry would pay off).  The girlfriend looked like the woods were the last place she wanted to be, but she was being a good sport about it.  They were saying something about having to get out of town for awhile due to some bad people.  Anyway, it’s all speculation, but I heard other stories about people going slightly off trail and encountering signs like they were warning of nuclear waste to keep hikers away.  The bottom line is, you don’t want to surprise people doing illegal activities, and if you do, you definitely want to make it seem like you have no idea what they’re doing.  Interestingly, the general hiker consensus was that meth was not a safe drug to dabble in, which was not the way all drugs were viewed.  
Cults:  The term is thrown around loosely, so here’s what to watch for:  If a group has a good enough sales pitch to make you consider performing slave labor for the rest of your life with only a strong sense of community as compensation, you are being conned.  Groups prey on young hikers looking for a little direction in life, and then they end up sweeping floors and manning booths at the farmers market for the rest of their lives, fourth wife to Bishop Joshua the Elder.  My advice is to stick to the plan and don’t make any rash life changing decisions mid hike when hiker fatigue is clouding your judgment.

There is more to be concerned about, and things that you are concerned about that you should be less concerned about, but life is short, and your time could probably be better spent figuring it out for yourself.
