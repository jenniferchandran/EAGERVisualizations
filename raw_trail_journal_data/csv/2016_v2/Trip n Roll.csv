Trip n Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479505,"This is my first entry on Trail Journals and the beginning of Gail, aka, TripnRoll’s great adventure. I have always liked to walk. It is a time for profound thought or no thought at all. I’m okay with either. I’ve wanted to take a walk on the Appalachian Trail since I was in high school; and that is a long time. Life happened with no regrets. My husband and I have reached retirement age. We are both in good health and for me, if I am ever going to attempt my dream now is the time to do it. With his blessing and the assurance that he doesn’t have to go with me, the date has been set. I’m looking forward to 3/23/2015.","

Trip n Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479606,"I feel that I am a person who always has a plan. My family on the other hand thinks that my plans are more like concepts. Both are creative endeavors requiring thought, organization and design. The concept is more abstract in nature. Life has taught me several things. First, there are very few plans that play out exactly as designed. Second, you have no control over outside factors only yourself.   Third, accepting and adapting to change is a necessary part of life.   And finally, there always needs to be a back-up plan.  I have a plan to hike the Appalachian Trail. I know my start date, where I will start from. I have my gear. I am beginning to prep my food and mail drops. I have a designated trail boss that will assist in getting out the things that I need. Training is in progress. Each is a step toward my goal, hiking the Appalachian Trail. I don’t know what the future holds. I do know that to reach a goal one has to make a plan, embrace the challenges that are presented, and those abstract ideas (concepts) rolling around your head will take you to that all important back-up plan. It is a multitude of back-up plans that will help you navigate the journey called life.","

Trip n Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479659,"82 days and counting....and I am at a loss for words. My supervisor knows when my last day of work will be. I had thought about asking for a leave of absence but decided against. I’m not sure what I might want to be when I grow up next time. I will have a lot of time to think about that one.  All I know right now is that I need to plan, prep and train. The time will come sooner than I think. I am looking forward with excitement and trepidation for the adventure to begin. Like always it means taking baby steps; putting one foot in front of the other moving slowly and deliberately toward my goal.",,Happy New Year!,"Jan 01, Thu",0
Trip n Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481647,"Well, life has a way of getting in the way of plans. I’m back to the concept phase of my life. We had our house on the market for five months with no takers. The plan was to let the contract expire and just wait until my walk was over. All it takes is one family that falls in love with the thing and plans change. Since I am a “mature” woman, code for old, I know that I need to find balance. I have always been conscientious and dependable and that won’t change. Life is fluid and concepts are currently in development. So, stay tuned for plan #2.","

Trip n Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517868,"My intent was to hike the trail last summer but life got in the way. So, plans were adjusted and a new start date was set. I am currently in training and did a nice day hike at Delaware Water Gap just prior to the Thanksgiving holiday. I made it up the mountain but know that I need to start strengthening the knees. Work will continue!",,"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again!","Nov 30, Mon",0
Trip n Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523909,"I have a week and a half before takeoff. I'm about as ready as I will ever be.During my walk today I got to thinking...always dangerous. I have been reading the journals of the hikers that have already started their journey. Most focus on the positives and minimize the negatives. I've decided over the years that backpacking is a lot like childbirth. While it's happening you think that this isn't what I signed on for....and it's never happening again. That is until you hold that baby in your arms and you begin to focus on the future. How does that equate to backpacking you ask? Well, the prep is the pregnancy. You are making plans and your imagination is fertile, positive and glowing. The hike itself is delivery. You find out that it is hard. My experience has been the first day is great. Probably due to fresh legs and adrenalin. The second day is good. Starting to feel those stressed muscles but tolerable. Day 3-7 stinks! Lactic acid is pooling in those muscles and you can't stretch enough or drink enough water to flush it out due to the rivers of sweat that is running down your back and into your eyes.At the end of the hike, you have endured the many hardships you faced, walked away unscathed or at least no worse for the wear and achieved your goal. As the days pass the hardships begin to fade. You focus on the positive memories and feel proud of your accomplishments. Then you start to plan your next adventure.I guess this is my takeaway. Some will start this journey with little experience prior to stepping foot on the AT. By the time they get to Neels Gap they consider tossing those hiking shoes into the tree. Don't do it. Take yourself back home and regroup. Take the time for the hardships to fade. I'm betting that you will take those skills you learned through the school of hard knocks and begin to explore your own backyard.Whew, that was a lot of thinking!",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Fri",0
