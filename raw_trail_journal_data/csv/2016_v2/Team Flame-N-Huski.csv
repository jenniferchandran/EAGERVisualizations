Team Flame-N-Huski,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480229,"G'day from W.A.! 
Two Aussies and Two Alaskan Malamutes.. 
Flame our Red and Huski our Black/Grey 
We adopted these two fur kids in Oct 2013 from the rescue organization Alaskan Malamute Rehoming Aid Australia. 
We intend to do Huski's head in on trail completely cause when he has had enough he wants to turn around and go back!
Flame on the other hand gives you the look you want to what!!! ?? No its more fun up head why would you wanna go back!.. thats red heads for ya! 
And the human components consists of KB and Jewels",,Maine to Georgia ,"Jan 06, Tue",
Team Flame-N-Huski,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480288,"So why would plan an international journey with 2 dogs?
We adopted/rescued the furkids (ages 6 and 8) in 2013 not realizing we would be going to travel.
Flame N Huski have fitted nicely into our life style and being rescue pack animals
we couldn't say well you have to stay behind! Kennel fees are expensive to say the least and no dog deserves to be kennel bound, let alone for 6 -12 months. So the only other alternative was to check the regs and see whether it was possible for them to come too.. 
Yep the issue is not going out of Australia but coming back in (as we suspected) and provided we get all the required shots and vet checks it is doable...",,Preparaton of Team Flame-N-Huski,"Jan 18, Sun",
Team Flame-N-Huski,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480325,"Aviation is KB's passion. Having worked in the industry for 20 years, you can understand why the sound of a plane appears to be enough info for him to know its breed! Jewelz is book fanatic and has worked with them for 25+ years. As a floor sales person then a Library Tecnician/Librarian. KB also has a passion for all things book! We prefer non fiction, but Jewels can succumb to Science Fiction/Fantasy on occasion! Latest reads are Wild and Animals Madness.....",,About the Humans!,"Jan 19, Mon",
Team Flame-N-Huski,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480427,"Jewelz has 6 months long service leave due in 2016 and what better way than to take a hike in the wilderness! 
Why not Australia you ask?? Well Jewelz has lived in all states except Tasmania! 
The fascination for Oz just isnt there any more.. 
KB hiked the (www.bibbulmuntrack.org.au) Bibbulmun Track a few years ago, and he suggested the AT.. We decided if we are going to go adventuring might as well go in style and see the world!",,Why SOBO?,"Jan 22, Thu",
Team Flame-N-Huski,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480550,"KB Walked 5.75 km with Jewel's and Flame-N-Huski. 
I had a very late start this morning, for a very slow walk at Reg Bond Reserve in Viveash, with Julie, Flame and Huski. We are getting so much less reactive with other dogs, even the little fluffies, 'who think they own the world'. Saying that even the dogs that were off lead were ALL under effective control. This made for a more enjoyable walk for everyone.
Flame is now officially a water dog. She still only just gets her feet wet, but she is now willingly and almost insistently wanting to paddle in ankle deep water. Soon she will be swimming like Huski, hopefully!
We also did a muddy creek crossing, with both dogs. Us Humans sank up to our knees in suction mud. So the humans crawled across on our hands and knees, to increase surface area, until the mud layer got less thick and we could touch a solid bottom.
Both dogs although uncertain about the mud crossing to begin with went across with some help. Flame in particular was ecstatic with herself when she got to the other side, as KB had to assist by holding her chest harness on the cross which boosted her confidence no end.",,Creek Crossing and Wet Tootsies,"Jan 25, Sun",
Team Flame-N-Huski,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482356,"Last weekend we managed to make it down to Grimwade for an overnight stay.
Its about a 3 hour drive from where we live. Into the pine and blue gum state forest that we are allowed to take the dogs.
We still have to be aware that 1080 baits may be around but the dogs are not prohibited from this area. We did an evening and the following morning walk, panning out to bout 13-15km (10 miles)Every one came home with smiles on their faces... and as for wanting to go out the front door.. well pups were quite happy to make sure they looked in the other direction to make sure we werent taking them out again so soon! ** Just worked out as of 27 Feb 2015 we have ~ 7 x 31 = 217 ~ 6 x 30 = 180 ~ 1 x 28 = 28. Total = 425 days before we head to Los Angeles on June 1. Drive across the USA to MAINE to start 13 June 2016.**",,Grimwade Western Australia,"Feb 27, Fri",
Team Flame-N-Huski,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515322,"Team Flame-N-Huski set off from Middle Swan on Saturday 26th Sept.It took us a week to walk 80+kms averaging 10km's. Shortest day was 8 k's and longest 14 k's.Besides water not being available on track from Clackline to Northam a distance of 17km. We had a great time.The 3 person Oztrail Breezeair tent was not big enough for comfortable sleeping, so we are now looking at trialing are 4 person tent. The Flame and Huski now adore the netting shell of the tent, due to the horsefly's biting, we gave them respite in the tent with out the fly on. And to be able to rest with out constant attack was respite enough to sleep.First night out we had fractious children from being exhausted and too close all day. But after that we separated them at night to give them there own space untll they came in to the tent. Where they sleep on opposite sides. With KB and I in the middle of them. Jewelz packed way to much food basing it on 3 meals a day when we actually had 2. One Muesli in the morning soaked overnight with milk. And a main meal cooked around lunchtime when we were having a break. Evenings consisted of a hot chocolate and coffee made for the morning. Pups had ZiwiPeak and K9 Natural for meals three times a day. ZiwiPeak worked well Flame didnt miss a meal! K9 Natural didnt meet our requirements, a crumbly food at best, although slightly lighter than Ziwipeak. 14 scoops for each dog was unrealistic. So we used it as a base for their lunches.",,Northam Western Australia,"Oct 07, Wed",
Team Flame-N-Huski,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515947,"Friday we went to a local forest to try our new tent..  The 4p Breezeway tent we have purchased is big enough for everyone !KB has purchased a Deuter Backpack and we gave both items a test run. They worked well.
NO complaining dogs being touched accidentally, enough room to bring in packs if required.  Pitches fairly well.. although it is a bit tall for me.. to reach top when pitching...When we arrive in USA we will be looking for a 4p tent that is not 180cm tall.. it only needs to be 140cm max, have 2 doors and be in 2 pieces so we can hide from the insects during rest periods...Booked Flights,and we will arrive in Los Angeles on the 31st May 2016.Visas and dog flights and car booking still to be done...",,Camping in the new 4p Tent,"Oct 17, Sat",
Team Flame-N-Huski,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518812,Travelled down South to do some hiking. Stayed in our camper and walked the trails around Northcliffe. Went to Windy Harbour 30ks away and took the dogs swimming and running along the beach.. both had a blast and came back tired little puppies!,,Car Camping,"Dec 29, Tue",
Team Flame-N-Huski,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520005,"Have applied for our American Visa's because we are staying over 6 months we have to visit the consulate. Any one under 3 months gets offered a standard etsa visa.
Oh the joys of getting organized.. they have changed our flight time.. so we leave at 11.50pm instead of 12.10am. Cancelled the flight we wanted to be on from Sydney. 
So now their will be no time to visit the dogs in between flights. Basically board them in Perth and see them again in Los Angeles! 
Starting to box up the housewares and get rid of things we dont want to put in storage. Doing up the kitchen that is 20+ years old.. then a paint job on the house ready to be rented for 12 months. 
We have been recommended an agent by a family friend and the tenants will be allowed to have pets.",,US Consulate Visit,"Jan 22, Fri",

We have arrived in Los Angeles. All 4 of us seem to have travelled reasonably well. Lack of sleep and jet lat is alreadyan issue.Border control was much less stres sful entering into the USA than any time i've returned back to Australia.
Picked up Chrysler Town and Country from Hertz. Drove the car / dozen times around the yard to get used to driving on the other side of the road, to that in Australia. 
The bonus is the van is fitted with a GPS navigation system. This made picking up the other  1/2 of the tea, Flame N Huski from QF air freight so much easier. We went to QF 1st then they sent us round to customs to fix up the usual paperwork, We then returned  back to QF to pick up some very happy pooches.
We dismantled their crates and put 1/2 inside the other. With a bit of manoeuvring the two 1/2's fitted nicely into the van once the seats were packed away into their recesses in the floor of the van. 
There was no seat intrusion like in other vehicles.
Very shortly after leaving QF we were on an interstate freeway.Even though driving on the freeway requires high speed driving, its a good place to gain confidence in driving in a different system as all you have to do is stay in a middle lane, maintain  the posted speed  and watch out for merging traffic.
First day we drove from Los Angeles to Turlock, 4 hours north and inland from LA. Julies friends Christine and Spurge invited us and the dogs over to have dinner and talk and talk and talk. Spurge and i are politically fellow travellers
Spurge gave me a ""feel the Bern"" Bernie Sanders unicorn button. We had corn beef cooked in a solar oven for dinner and left their place just after 1am for our motel room in a Motel 6 chain.
Motel 6's are basic but dog friendly and cheap. They have queen size beds, a shower, TV if you can watch it, hanging space, but no fridge. Then all we want is a shower and some where for the Mutts, at a keen price.
We spent 2 days in Turlock, nourished by good food and people, human conversation. I ended up having mock sabre sword fights with Nick on their front lawn.There are 2 offspring in the household. Nick who is Christine's son, and Sydney who is Spurge and Christine's daughter.
Spurges work is nice and close to home. Its as a driveway attendant across the road.","Flew in from Sydney to Los Angeles.

Team Flame-N-Huski,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646617,"3 - 5 June  2016 AT 
on the 3rd of June we commenced our little road trip across America, with a diversion to Lake Tahoe. We wanted to try Flame and Huski on canoes before we had the canoe crossing on the AT. The 1st part of the drive was to Tahoe south and staying at another Motel 6. 
On the 1st morning in Tahoe South, we had a walk along a multi use path. We started having leas issues with FLame. We moved off the path so we wouldnt impede fellow users. As we were working on the leads a black bear came up on the path 3 - 4 metres away from us, walked along the path 10 metres and then walked away from us back into the bush. 
I am certain neither of the pups noticed the bear and if the bear noticed us, it just minded its own business. 
Later in the day we drove over very narrow alpine roads to Tahoe North about 35 mile away to see if we could get the canoe rides, but alas it had closed for the day. SO after some walks we returned to our motel.
The road back had runners doing a 24 hour relay race around the lake, going through all the communities on Lake Tahoe's edge.
Next day we left Tahoe South earlyish to get  back the canoes early enough so that we could good distance once we finished.
We hired the canoe for 3 hours. But had our answers in less than 2 hours. Huski and I went in from the pier, across about 300 - 400 metres of water to the beach where Julie and Flame had walked. Huski settled down quite quickly once we got going and seemed to enjoy it. I had to lift Flame into the canoe, once Huski and I had got out and Julie had got in.
Julie paddled out and got used to steering and paddling a canoe. Flame just laid her head in Julie's lap.
I then loaded Huski into the front of the craft and got in behind him. Julie then paddled us back to the pier. We all got back onto dryland, with out any of us getting wet, other thangetting in and out at the beach.
Driving out of North Tahoe was a breath taking visa of distant snow capped mountains, alpine rivers and vegetation.
Much of the driving to New York was a blur of trucks rest stops toll booths trucks rest stops toll booths and walmarts.
We tried out our new rent at one of the rest stops and found it worked satisfactorily to our expectations.
We found out that most states we were allowed to sleep in the car, but we weren't allowed to camp at the rest stop.This was uncomfortable as any one can imagine.
We arrived in Chautauqua New York mid afternoon, in time for Julie to sign in for her librarians conference, for us to find a campground and for Julie to showers and change for an afternoon boat cruise on Lake Chautauqua for 3 hours.
While Julie was on the cruise I walked Flame N Huski around the campus of the Chautauqua Institute.
The Chautauqua Institute is an old campus set up in the 1800's on the shores of Lake Chautauqua.
There is possible 50-100 houses all taking up very small footprints, but most are 2 or 3 stories tall.Apparently like so many pioneering settlements most of the original accommodation was in tents.Unlike most otherers when it came to constructing more permanent structures they kept their original site sizes and simply built up.Apart from the Admin buildings and 2 or 3 more recent structures built out of stone or clay brick, all others are wooden weather board (clapboard) outer walls with either wood or slate shingles on the rooves. 
The streets are narrow 1 car wide lanes. The whole campus is beautiful, has a monastery book quality about it.While Julie attended the conference we used our tent for he 2nd time. We stated at a trailer park campground nearby.
The owners/caretakers were from one of these religious groups like the Amish, where the bloke can dress in ordinary clothes but the women dress in below the knee smocks, with atrocious grey stockings and lace caps. Very strange. They still got around  in a large pick up ute and did their chores with getting into a cart type (motorised) vehicle.
In this part of New York I haven't seen any black horse and carts, but there are yellow traffic signsadvising us about horses on local roads.
The park its self was clean well maintained  and quiet, except when Huski arced up over meal time.or when Flame was getting attention.","Lake Tahoe and The Chautauqua ​Institute Conference

After 2 days of procrastination at Shaws Hostel we a got a lift to Abol Bridge by Gary one of the seasonal employess.
A photo was taken of us heading into the woods.
After a few steps we came across a sign in box for us to register our presence on the trail. 
From over in the bush a little we hear a guy introduce himself as Grandpa. 
He was camping at the head of the trail waiting for his birthday on18th June before heading south.
Our first night was spent at Hurd Brook lean to with Grandpa and associates. 
(NOTE: We met Grandpa again just after we had lost Huski!)","Shaw's Hostel - Ride to Abol Bridge.
