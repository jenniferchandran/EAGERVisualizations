Catfish Jon ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513714,"""I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains, Where the spirits go now, Over the hills where the spirit flies"". 
It seems just last week the idea of taking a six month vacation from life was barely a seed in the ground. Now its mid September, I have put in my notice at work, and finally begun to embrace the full excitement to start this journey.The idea came around as I was reluctantly applying for jobs after four years of school. I had played tennis in Grand Junction and was ready for a change of scenery. However, I had not given a single thought to what I wanted to do. Up until this point everything in my life had been decided. 
I started writing songs shortly after picking up a guitar when I was 16, and had obsessed over every aspect of music in college. Through the college years the songs got polished, as well as my playing and performing. This became my passion. Now looking back its hard to see myself falling into anything besides music, save the outdoors.
I decided to return home for some reflecting and planning. knowing full well it was just a pit-stop. After enjoying some time to myself, playing music every day, buying a few motorcycles, and stumbling upon new interests I rediscovered what I was looking for, The Appalachian trail. In all its glory and mystery. Winding through 14 states and 2200 miles, the challenging trail intrigued me. Knowing 3 million people cant be wrong I started investigating. After I indulged in some A.T. literature, my interest was at its peak, so i started collecting gear, knowledge, anything that would help me along the way.
I am in high spirits for my hike. So much happening at this time in my life, I am looking forward to really considering how i want to spend my days.",,The Time has Come.,"Sep 17, Thu",0
Catfish Jon ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515884,"Its another beautiful day mid October in Arizona. As my time for preparation dwindles, the anticipation builds. I have done plenty of mental preparation. Between the thousands of gear choices and trail journals, I have gathered about as much information as humanly possible. The endless opinions from self proclaimed experts rattle across the Internet. The sheer amount of material related to the Appalachian trail available to the public amazes me. The information is immense and widespread in style, and varies so much it can be hard to identify who has useful knowledge.When it comes down to it, you can hike the trail anyway you choose. Whether you are an ultralight gear junkie carrying 25lbs, a hulk hiker trucking around with 50lbs of gear, or somewhere in between, someone has most likely successfully hiked with a similar setup. During the last few weeks I have spent quite a bit of time in the local Hualapai Mountain range learning my gear, and how my body responds to different pack weights. So far my pack is far from ultralight (Although containing numerous ""UL"" gear items). I intend to carry about 35-40lbs, which is including a backpacking guitar and other personal items i refuse to leave behind. First test weight was 40lbs, which felt light at the bottom of the mountain. By the time i got to the top my back was a little sore, but I felt strong, and could have doubled the total 10 miles that I covered that day.The following week i tried with 30 lbs of gear, exact same hike. To be completely fair I did do squats in the gym that morning, however i was noticeably tired and weak compared to the earlier, heavier hike. All in all I believe I can and will complete a my 2016 NOBO Appalachian trail through hike. What i can't believe is that in six short months I will be making this dream a reality.",,Two Steps Forward,"Oct 15, Thu",0

Catfish Jon ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518817,"The two month countdown has not officially begun, but the trail is right around the corner. My pack is becoming more impressive as I near the start of this adventure. Slowly but surely the remaining required/desired items are finding their way into my hands. Just some of the things I have recently purchased: Salamon Speedcross 3's Trail running shoes, Water proof pack cover, A few miscellaneous Sea to Summit Dry-sacs, Platypus Big Zip 3L, Couple pair of Darn Tough 3/4 Merino Wool, Patagonia Nano-Air jacket, Patagonia Torrentshell Rain jacket, Snow Peak Titanium cookset, Icebreaker 3/4 zip wool baselayer... The list goes on and on. Along with the continuation of weight training and running, Physical preparation has also included plenty of hiking. For my sisters 21st birthday my family and I hiked the Grand Canyon, 23 miles and 4,800 ft. in elevation in two half days of hiking. The weather at the top of the South Rim was a bone-chilling 14 degrees, paired with 30 mph winds when we arrived on Saturday afternoon. The weather I could handle, the impatient swarm of foreign (and domestic) tourists I could not. After two shuttles (We hiked down Kaibab and up Bright Angel, which have different starting points along the south rim) and some Disneyland-ish lines, we finally arrived at the trail head. Carrying my entire pack (Save a bit of food weight) I started down the trail. Starting with a snow pack trail and slowly shifting to mud, and then dry dirt, the trail was steep, but well maintained. I focus not on speed, but reducing the stress on my knees. With so many beautiful views it is an easy hike down to Phantom ranch. We finish with a mere 9.5 miles under our belt, and are eager for the morning hike.After a night of drinks and and games we hit the sack at 10 o clock. The 5:30 wake up call comes to soon, I regretfully rise and stuff my face with as many carbs as my weak morning stomach can handle, and we head off to Bright Angel trail. We hike for an hour and a half before the sun shows its face. Already across the Colorado river and about 2 miles in we are making great time, but Bright Angel trail is longer, and we do a scenic loop adding another 3 miles. The switchbacks are never-ending, and the weight is wearing me down. We slug onward and I gain a second wind. We make it out at 1 o clock. The hike was wonderful, I look forward to refining my pack and my methods, and starting the hike with full knowledge of my gear.Till next time!!",,Grand Canyon,"Dec 29, Tue",0
Catfish Jon ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520968,"Hello again!I'm fairly certain it is a direct result of anticipation, however my body is rebelling. Since my high school sporting days, I have had some level of pain in my back. In high school it was lumbar specific pain, however the last few years have been solely around the right shoulder blade. The pain level have peaked in recent weeks, making me a little uneasy. Hours of daily stretches and massage type therapy cannot touch the pain. I also think it has something to do with my broken collarbone on the left side. I never had it repaired by surgery and as such causes my left shoulder to sit slightly higher and feel out of balance now and then.I managed to roll my ankle playing hoops which adds to the drama as well. I can feel it during some stretches although it is usually just an irritation not really a pain. However my walk feels strong, as do I. The work week drags on as I look ahead to adventure.My gear has continued to evolve into a respectable thru-hiker setup. My familiarity with the gear has doubled from the overnight stays I have been taking (Which Nikita (my dog daughter) has greatly appreciated!). I worry about leaving her for so long. She is my shadow! However, I firmly believe leaving the burden of caring for another life is better left in the warm comforts of home.Till next time!- ""Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose""",,My Broken Body,"Feb 10, Wed",0

I have about 95 % of the gear I plan on starting with, which is a big sigh of relief. I had previously planned on working just through February, but i tacked on another week (till the 4th of March!) to help with funds and preparation. Dirt-bike is going up for sale as well (Get to keep my Harley though! woot woot!)Still have not got around to weighing my pack, I'm afraid of what I will find! Still working on getting my phone trail proof. I have exhausted myself preparing my itunes for this trip. Which may seem a bit strange but coming from a music nut its about as essential as anything else. Still have one DIY project to complete before I go and that is to create a waterproof(ish) bag for my martin backpacker. Which is another music-nut endeavor but is important none the less.As soon as I will try to upload some pictures of the my gear as well as the weight!

Catfish Jon ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522673,"Unfortunately, this is the second time typing this journal, I only now noticed it missing. So much has been happening!I sold my dirt bike to add some comfort cash to my trips budget. Along with that and the kindness of others, which I will dive into momentarily, I am well stocked for my journey.I have added plenty of additional gear to my pack. Switching out my homemade alcohol stove for Titanium Vargo stove (that can burn fuel tabs, fuel gels, as well as alcohol) and paired it with a folding windscreen it was a definite upgrade to my cooking system. I finally purchased a new set of Aquamira, and being a Nervous Nancy I decided to also bring a Lifestraw, in case I'm feeling impatient. If I feel i can go with just Aquamira purification method I will send the LIfestraw home. After reading some save your feet articles, it appears to me that sock liners can reduce blisters. So i got a few pairs of the Injinji toe liners to test out. If i don't like them they can catch a possible ride with the Lifestraw. Some other less exciting additions include my homemade first aid kit, bear bag line, a feather-lite sunhat, and camp shoes. I could not get over the fanny pack clad, dad image that comes to mind with crocs. Plus, my inner flower child was already set on Bedrocks sandals.Pack weight was originally 25 llbs, which was a pleasant surprise considering I had my guitar, hiking poles, and every ounce of clothing i would have. But after some renegotiating with my self I had it down to 23.5 Not to shabby! Last Friday was my last day of work, which was bittersweet. I will miss them, however with so much going on getting ready for this hike its hard to look back even momentarily. One of my last days at work, an incredibly kind aspiring thru-hiker asked which watch i would be hiking with. I explained I had none, and he offered up his hiking watch. An awesome compass, barometer wielding Pro trek. Thanks for the loan Ray!!! Momma bird also helped me make my waterproof guitar bag out of a food sealer bag. Looks like it was made for it!Flying out on my birthday! What a great way to start another year. Staying with some friends in Atlanta for an unknown amount of days before starting the hike.

Catfish Jon ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523334,"Today was the last day in Atlanta for me. I said goodbye to Matt and Paula (Again, thanks for everything!!) who were kind enough to let me in and show me around. II hitched the Marta train to North Springs and from there I met Philip, and another incredibly kind thru hiker. We were then picked up and shuttled to the ""Hiker Hostel"" which has been amazing as well. A lot of kind people.Tonight is relaxing, and I am ready for the difficult climb up the Amicolola Falls tomorrow. I will eat breakfast at the hostel and join a few other thru hikers who are starting tomorrow. Some from the approach, some from Springer. I chose the approach trail even though not technically part of the AT. Although I am not starting. On the AT tomorrow I definitely will take my first steps on it.Right now I'm relaxin round a fire less fire pit. Jamming my little fingers away alone in the dark.

Catfish Jon ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523645,"Feels great to be writing my first on trail trail journal, although you will be reading this a day behind (Sprint sucks in the east coast so far). Started the morning off with some good deep stretching. It was either the daylight savings recoil, or the build up of excitement to finally set foot on the AT. Mike from Virginia, super awesome vet of the Air Force, and another couple from Louisiana are the only ones of the coming down from the hiker hostel to do the approach trail. The vigorous uphill journey to springer mountain starts from Amicolola Falls State Park. Steep and crystal clear, the falls were definitely sight to see. Once on top you finally reach a more 'typical' AT scene in the south. Lots and lots of trees, and lots and lots of hills. Mike is great company, about half way up the 8.8 mile incline however we separate and I meet another thru hiker, he's nineteen and into bike touring. He is a good match for my pace and we stay together for a bit. The trail is exactly as I imagine, in all its winding wet glory. We reach the summit of Springer Mountain swiftly. There are some thru hikers and section hikers that are at the lookout. People are all very nice, we share stories while I cook my first trail meal. Spicy beef Mac, a simple meal to fix but with the view it is a meal for a king. I contemplate hiking farther than Springer mountain shelter but my friends are here, and I am content to take it easy on the first day of many. It's Christmas, all the gear I initially invested in is finally used to its full potential. Even filtering and purifying water is interesting. I chat for a bit, about 20 people spread out through the shelter and campsites. I pitch my tent with maximum visibility for sun up.More to come. Catfish Jon","Amicolola Falls State Park

Catfish Jon ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523646,"After a long day I finally reached my planned destination. I am now 14.5 miles from the southern terminus at Justice Creek.I awoke on Springer with fresh legs, despite the Amicolola falls. Deciding to do some decent miles I set my eye in the range 12. The trail is a slip and slide at first but quickly becomes a hiker highway and I start flying. Before to long I have hiked 7 miles and I was ready for lunch. Just so happens a waterfall appeared as my stomach was growling. So I pulled off to enjoy a meal with a view. After a huge meal. I am back on the trail. It is green and rich with water for the first half of the day.Which leads me to second half. Two really steep climbs. These are silly steep inclines, instead of switchbacks it's natures staircase. Up up up until I can't go any farther. Finally some ""justice"" when I hit justice creek. I go to set my tent up and it starts dumping rain, fortunately good enough with my tent that I get it up without getting too much wet, however much of the night is spent returning things to their original dryness. I talk to another Mike, who is hiking to Fontana Damn. He like most, is great company. We BS for a while, and then I show him my bear bag method.

I wake up dry, and have a really slow morning. Make coffee, and oatmeal. And head out. It is the hottest day, and I am exhausted. I remember reading about Suches, GA, and as such, I am dreaming of Taco Bell. Or anything a small town might have in regards to food.After a difficult climb reach Neel gap. I try to hitch hike and eventually just call the outfitter. I meet an awesome guy named vanilla. He goes through a ""pack explosion"". Which means he makes sure you have proper gear, and gives advice. (Vanilla already completed an AT thru hike). Most all my gear matches Vanilla's gear, I decide to send a few items home anyway, rain pants, life-straw, and a water bottle hit the road along with my iPod. There is a convenience store where I eat a large pizza, three sodas, a milk, and a Milky Way. Hiker hunger is REAL.I get dropped off at woody gap where I camp for the night. The next morning I am up at six packing and making coffee. The weather is foggy and chilly. I decide to take off. The wind quickly blows over and reveals a summer day. It is beautiful, and the trail is easy. I make great time and before you know it, I have summited Blood mountain. There was more people on the summit of blood mountain than I have seen on the trial in the last three hours. I take a few pictures and down I go.Was only forty minutes down the backside before I hit Neels gap and the famous Mountain Crossings gear shop. I take a load off and am excited to see Mike from Florida again. After a while of poking around the gear shop, I get a new shirt and send my cotton Circa Survive shirt home. My pack weight is down to 33 lbs with food. After drinking a few more sodas, I hear people talking about cabins being 72 bucks for a night. Sweet deal! Me and mike split one and have an amazing little set up.

Soon I have resupplied completely at Mountain Crossings, but half my day is gone. I set my eye on Whitley shelter which sits a leisurely 5 miles or so away. The climb is steep but rewarding, as you all some amazing view facing the north east. I take my guitar out and entertain a few hikers who seem please with my takes. Pushing onward I hit whitely gap in stride. I decide it's much to early to rest and push forward to the next shelter. I meet up with three older folk that I stayed with at the Hiker hostel, nice people., and also run into Mike who I slip the cabin with last night. I stride ahead and after a lot of false peaks I wind up at Low Gap shelter.

Low gap was comfortable last night, not sure what the temperature was. Woke up around 7 with the sun, feeling rested and restless. I got up and started the teardown. The switch from my footprint to the Tyveck mat is proving valuable, I use it to organize and pack in the morning. After the usual coffee oatmeal breakfast me and newly named Wahoo! are set to take off on our morning hike. Before the shoulders start to ache we hit red clay gap. It feels great to know that we have made such progress. We set our eyes on Unicoi gap. The climb was easy, however coming down from blue mountain slippery, with uneven boulders taking up quarter mile sections. Although the are not big enough to have to scramble around, they are ankle breakers, so my pace is slow. That is until I hear of trail magic nestled at the bottom of the gap. Barn-sour, I accelerate down and meet the lovely angels blessing me with BBQ and Powerade. After hearing of thunderstorms, Wahoo! and I decide a day in a hostel would be nice, and wouldn't ya know a Top of Georgia shuttle pulls in behind.

Not too bad after all. After some tweaking of the gear, some other thru hikers and I went to town. I meet up with Puma, and his friend Flipper. Puma is a percussionist and as such we hit the community instrument collection. 3-20-19After some food, good laughs, and plenty beer I awoke from the zero with a new skin (shower didn't hurt). I set my sights on 16 miles to go from Unicoi gap to Dicks creek. This is a task considering the climbs in between.Wahoo! had a lot of fun the previous night and as such is falling a little behind at the hand of the 30 degree incline. GPS is close most of the time until the very top when I step ahead slightly. It is much colder today, so cold I'm regretting my short shorts for hiking attire. It is, however, easier to continue on and keep the blood flowing, rather than stop and change. The climb is tough but we are rewarded with a Steven King type fog rolling in 360 degrees around us. We continue on to lunch at a blue blaze to some water. I settle on a pasta side and get cooking.

Catfish Jon ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525257,"Writing this from my bed in the Sapphire Inn. This was my second zero day in a row.I have been putting off writing this journal for a while. It feels more real when I write about it. Starting after the long ascent to the fire tower (mile 100) I started feeling a slight pain in my right foot. I have had my share of growing pains in my hike so far, but this one lingered. I felt it on the ascent. I was able to forget about it with the views, but every downhill step was a pain.I had been making great time, and miles. This may have been the problem. Down the long hill, I started to feel it with every step. I tried loosening my shoes, I stopped and took breaks, I stretched... Nothing was helping. Finally I hit Rock Gap. I saw Puma and some other thru hikers resting. With immense relief he told me there was a shuttle to Franklin on its way!Fast forward to getting a hotel room, and relaxing. My foot was hurting, I kept ice on it, but it was worrying me. Finally I cracked and called the foot and ankle clinic and sought out an appointment. Five days, and I needed a primary physician referral. I had also read there was foot experts at the Outdoor 76 shop. We headed that way.What came next was scary, and probably a bit unnecessary looking back. We met one of the owners, who has an immense amount of physiological knowledge. Having the Radiologic Technology background I was able to understand most, and backup his claims.He measured my foot, not just size, but arch lengths, as well as other palpable not landmarks to outline my foot, and get and idea of its shape. He then asked about my problems. Once I informed him, and Puma (who was getting his feet analyzed as well) of some harsh news. Both of us had different types of tendinitis. This injury sounds like a tiny problem, but considering the distance we were into the trail (a mere 100 miles) and that this is an overuse injury, it could send us home.I found out the Speed cross 3s I was wearing The grim reality was tough to swallow. It was an uneasy zero day. I spent the time drinking beer, icing my foot, stretching, and consuming an unhealthy amount of calories. Contemplating my future was another hot topic in my thoughts.I did a considerable amount of pack work while we were laid up at the Sapphire Inn. I sent a lot of stuff home, including the 4 pound guitar and accessories. Along with that I changed camp shoes. I never thought my soles would brave the rubber creation that is Crocs, but here I am. The selling point being the ability to wear my camp socks, with my camp shoes (not sure how I didn't realize this earlier) bedrocks would only work with toe socks. I also cut my pack towel in half, got rid of my bug repellent lotion. My pack is now in the 28s with food and water.Another addition (future addition) is the switch to an Osprey Exos 58. I am having it shipped to Fontana Damn along with my first package (thanks Mum!) The pack switch will out me around 26 and I'm sure I can find more stuff to spare. SAVE THE FEET!","Betty Creek Gap

Stealth camping after hiking 12 miles from the Mountain Harbor After getting into the town on Thursday, I had one swollen ankle. It was not in any pain but proceeded to tighten up, and continued to bug me as I did the resupply and other in town activities. I met up with flipper and got subway, as we pondered where we were laying out heads for the night. Thanks to a note Flipper left on the trial, everyone else poured into town over the next two hours.We decided on Mountain Harbor Hostel, and after hitching a ride and seeing the place I was pleased with my decision. The bed and breakfast was a classic country home on a hill with a river running beneath. Equipped with a hug wrap around porch, it was a picturesque scene. Beneath the bed and breakfast home was a rustic barn that only added to the charm, it was converted into a hostel and general store for a minor resupply. Although the hostel was intriguing, I choose the solitude of my tent. Tenting was set off to the side towards a rentable treehouse. It was a cool place to rest and with the added motivation from the ankle, and a fire set back that seemed to pop up out of nowhere.The Railroad Grade fire had reached a point where closing that section of the trail was necessary. A long reroute that added to the drama was also in play. An extra 23 miles to walk, and more food to carry. A lot of scaremongering was bouncing around the hostel. In my not so humble opinion, it was a lot of nonsense from people who like to hear themselves talk. This all cleared over after a zero day of rain. We found out the trail was open and I was running back to the woods where I belong. It was an easy climb out of the hostel, and some gorgeous scenery when you got past the power lines strung from town to town. Before to long I was at the waterfall 5 miles in. I stopped to explore and rest the feet. It was a good break and my friends Beaver and Jah rolled in to enjoy the views with me.After an easy breezy beautiful 7 miles I hit my destination. A nice water source with a few tiny camp sites. I did my meditation and yoga with flipper doing his before anyone had time to ruin the solitude.

I was the first one out of camp and made decent time. The first morning push was tough and took some getting used to. After a few good sections I took a nice break and loosened up.After a while I wasn't thinking about my normal right foot pains, it was another pain that was ailing me. My left Achilles was inflamed and it made every step and adventure. It felt like a long time but I arrived at 3:00. One of the benefits of leaving before sun up. I finally got to my destination of Black Bear Resort to pick up a package my Mom had sent. It was a half a mile up a farm road with some interesting characters but the hostel was awesome. I decided to set my tent up anyway. I am accustomed to its walls, and after setting it up falsely the first time, I found the perfect spot. Back behind their wedding venue was a meadow with bumble bees chirping birds. I moved my tent to the new spot, and read the Hobbit, and drank my Guinness.

First day back on the trail in a few days, walked 15 miles today from Woodchuck Hostel.After my big 26 mile day into Damascus, the question wasn't if I was zeroing, rather how many zeros I would take. The first one flew at light speed, as I chased my various chores around town. I was able to cross laundry off my list, but I had still had much more to do. A bounce box to pick up, and my Hokas to ship off, as well as cut my remaining winter gear out and send it home. By the time I got to buying new shoes it was almost dinner time, and subsequently, bedtime. The second was a lot of fun chores as well including treating all the gear with Permethrin to help combat the bugs. I had some odds and ends with food to do, and the hostel had a guitar which occupied a lot of my afternoon. There is a group of hikers who have been bringing a blue jeep along the way to support themselves and they had rented an amazing riverside home that they had a party at which I partook in. Fireside beers, some drinking games, all hikers welcome. It was quite the time.The last zero (4-30-15) was much more relaxing and I was able to get some creative work done on the guitar. It started raining late that day and it kept on all night.Finally we get to today. Woke up around 7 and had breakfast, blueberry waffles and coffee a la Woodchuck. Next step was getting all my things in order which took less time than usual, and I was out the door of the hostel for the last time. After some subway and last minute checks I decided to hit the trail. It felt so good to be walking, and I was overwhelmed with the smell of the forest. I was alone all day as Bones, Bees, Puma, and Wahoo! we're all either hiking the creeper trail which parallels the AT, or he left after me. After some sweat and good climbs I hit a reroute. It was minimal and I continued on until I hit the merger of the two trails. I was warm enough to swim in the cold river and enjoyed it to the fullest. Drying off took some time, managed to be back on the trail in 45 minutes. The last 2.4 clicked by as I climbed to Lost Mountain Shelter.

It had been gloomy all day including the small amount of rain we got last night, but the sun shine through and revealed amazing views. I knew of imminent Pony encounters and sped up the next incline to the side of Mt. Rogers. When I got to the top I saw a side trail and when I walked out I could see a herd of ponies! I walked over and say next to them, there was a tiny one barely big enough to walk. I watched for thirty minutes as they graze and play. After 45 minutes with my first pony family I moved on up the trail and put some good miles in. There was a side trail that was .5 to the top, which I did even with no views. The Thomas Knob shelter came quickly, and I sat down for a snack and to write in the log book. The next section was my absolute favorite of the day, as well as the entire trip. There was the ground was lined with grass and pine needles, and the trail mirrored some cinema landscapes I have dreamed of. I after all this I thought it couldn't get better, and then came the entrance to Grayson Highlands State Park. There was another group of ponies welcoming me into the park. The terrain was beautiful, but dark grey clouds hung overhead. In fact it managed to make it more beautiful. In light of the recent heat this was the perfect hiking weather. The whole day was spent alone and I think I needed it, I meditated for an hour in between the shelters. It was a peaceful time despite the thunder in the distance. The Fatman squeeze was entertaining as all get up, reminding me of the Lemon Squeezer in my college town of Grand Junction.After some more miles I felt a few rain drops and picked up pace. In a matter of minutes the flood gates opened up and rain fell through. In a matter of minutes I was soaked, I knew I had some time before the shelter but was not sure how long.

Leaving the car in Daleville we were going back to Catawba to head for McAfees Knob. He was late, which made us late.Finally we got to the trailhead and were sad to see fog covering the area. McAfees Knob is the iconic Appalachian trail photo, and should be viewed in sunlight if possible. It was the land of day hikers and even with Mamafish's pace we passed plenty on our way to the top. I separated about a mile left to get some along time and relax, ended up running into a few deer. They were very relaxed and let me view them up close for some time. The knob was foggy when I arrived, but I was alone and pleased with the solitude and the minor views. I sat feet dangling off the edge and thought about everything across the sky before Mamafish arrived. We took pictures and snacked and right as we were leaving the clouds opened a bit and allotted a view of the valley below. The next few miles where also beautiful in there own right, but felt like an obstacle between me and Tinker Cliffs. I hiked ahead again to see spot alone and take it all in. Tinker cliffs was beautiful, my favorite spot on the trail. The clouds had parted and I had a view of everything. Virginias rolling green hills and pastures, cattle graving in the fields. It was a sight to be had.We had food and took our time on the .5 cliff walk, then down to the shelter. The shelter was closed due to bear activity but was the last water between us and the next afternoon. We stocked up and then kept trucking. Before to long we had more views and found the temporary campsites marked for us. We kept going and found an awesome spot by a rock monolith. Two dinners, and the Guinness I packed out. Small talk with Mamafish, then bed and more hiking!My hip has been a little out of whack, praying for a change in its end.Fish","VA 311(Catawba)

I love the ten privacy but if you can avoid packing up a wet tent every so often, it can save a lot of time on packing. I was later than I hoped but my lack of immediate hunger allowed me to to roll out without breakfast. The first gap came quickly. The second was a longer stretch and with a decent climb. I was in a little funk but finally hit a groove, I was at the second Buchanan crossing and waited just 2 minutes for Mamafish. The lunch was good, and I was back on the trail within an hour and ten minutes. I had a huge climb and didn't want to waste good weather. Mamafish went up the first climb with me and down to a creek somewhere off the backside before she turned around and hiked south to the car. The climb was big, I didn't know for sure, as I neglected the book all day. Bambi informed me of the correct distance while Panda spoke of elevation change. It was not going to be fun, but I chugged ahead and tried to get the ball rolling. The climb was massive. I'm talking sweat falling off every step, might have a heat stroke, calve burning climb.

Couple that with a high pitch wine in the same ear, and a slight breakdown.Finally we made the call to get out of the woods. We were 1 mile past Otter Pond trail (which lead to a parking lot). We made the decent quick and were on the way to the ER.Unfortunately no answers were given, besides as Eustachian tube dysfunction. Got a prescription, stay tuned...Fish","Wilson Valley Lean-to

Catfish Jon ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546870,"Writing this from Carl A. Newhall lean-to. Hiked a long 22 miles from Otter Pond parking. After a nice deaf zero day at Shaws, we headed back into the wild. My head was still turning from all the chaos, and the ear is still ringing and deaf. It took us a second to get from the hostel to the trail we had left from, but we made it.Start the clock at around 10:00, when we reached the AT. We had a tough day ahead, filled with some of the last mountains we would hit. Barren Mtn, which took my hearing, was the first. Then fourth Mtn. Then third Mtn. Then chairback Mtn. It was tough ten or so miles. So much sweat, but I was thankful for the clouds that kept the heat at bay.We decided to hike the last section alone, which is not always the most enjoyable, it can make the miles disappear. I hit the six mile mark in under two hours. We are staying in the shelter tonight to avoid the rain!Fish & Bambi","Shaws Hostel

Catfish Jon ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546871,"Writing this from a stealth campsite near Jo Mary Rd. (2133.1 miles from my start) Hiked another 22.6 miles from Carl A Newhall lean-to. Woke up after a night long down pour. It was not extremely intense, but continued all through the night. We got going after our shelter companions had left. The first climb was up to Gulf Hagas was tough, the temperature was nice and low to keep us cool. It was a short lived warmth, and we dropped down the backside into the campsite, and then back up West Peak. Whitecap Mtn. Where we are supposed to have our first view of Katahdin, was a white out. The wind nearly blew us down the backside as we descended to the shelter. After some food we made the rest of the miles disappear. Found a campsite by the river, home for the night!Fish","Carl A Newhall Lean-to

We got moving regretfully after another big day. Fortunately the terrain was flat, and the body hasn't completely given up on me. We we aiming high for another big day. We had a few small Mtns to conquer but it couldn't slow us down. We made the shelter in great time, and set up in a field of moss and tall pines.Into Abol Bridge tomorrowDeafCat","Jo Mary Road

Catfish Jon ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546873,"Writing this from a stealth campsite somewhere just south of Abol bridge. Hiked 15 miles from Rainbow stream lean-to. Woke up pretty early atop our bed of moss. It was chilly this morning and before I took my sleeping off I could tell it would be a great weather day. The scenery in Maine has been second to none. The general trail views are my favorite. The green tunnel at its best.My ear unfortunately is not at its best. And has been my chief complaint for the last few days. I try my best to put it aside but constantly comes creeping back, bringing some anxiety.I manage okay today, the miles are mellow, and so is the terrain. My body senses the end, and is falling apart at the seams. We hit the golden road and know the 100 mile wilderness is over, and soon we were sitting eating at Abol bridge. We decided not to stay (not that we had a choice) and packed up headed south. The view of Katahdin are making this a reality. The mountain gleams In the distance, and towers atop the trees. It's broad ridge (knifes edge) cuts through the clouds as they pass. 10 tomorrow. Then 4.5 to the top.Fish","Rainbow Steam Lean-to

Catfish Jon ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547162,"Writing this from Katahdin stream campsite, five miles shy of summit. Hiked 10 miles from Abol bridge.Woke up to another beautiful morning. We have been blessed the last few days with magnificent weather. The sun is shining across the river and reflecting up into the tent. We pack up slow because we have to stall to make it to the store after it opens. Coffee was weak but necessary all the same. We meet a lot of northbound thru hikers, some we have known for some time. Congrats is a common phrase as we share some of our best memories. We hit the trail and register for Katahdin at Baxter state park boundary. The trail is flat and well maintained, and we make short work of it. Winding along the river, and poking across small river fords. The mile pass quick. We reach the campsites lower end at one o clock. Where we see some who just finished the hike. They all look relieved, and complete. After paying for the campsite we relax with out buddy Patriot. As we are sitting at a bench he jumps up and exclaims ""mom?!"" A car that passed by resembled his own and he races to see it. Turned out to actually be his mom, with a ton of trail magic. Hamburgers and hotdogs, even sodas and an ice chest. The day is made and saved, because we have never been to camp this early with nowhere else to go!After some relaxing and Lord of the Rings reading, we hit the sack, for the last time, in the tent.Surreal feelings...Catfish","Abol Bridge

Catfish Jon ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547163,"Writing this from Thoreau Spring, sitting in thick fog on top Katahdin. Decided to write my last journal from the to while its fresh in my mind (Also, Bambi is currently summiting with her parents for a second time).I woke up this morning feeling pretty low. My ear is still full of fluid and I can't hear at all out of it. To make it a little more difficult my ankle which has given me problems in the not so distant past, is also acting out. I got up to drain the bladder and noticed a sharp pain, it hadn't dulled by the morning. I was convinced to at least try to summit.We were packed up and eating breakfast at 6, ready to hike at 6:30. Everyone at the campsite is buzzing with energy ready to finish what they started. I am excited, but nervous, hoping my poor bones will make the finish line.The trail started easy, and smooth. A mile in it turned sour, and rocks became boulders. The incline gradually rose to its Katahdin shape. Soon we hit the falls which were a beautiful tease of the mountain to come. After what seemed like hours we finally hit the tree line. Jagged boulders and slabs sticking out into thin air. The trail made trekking poles unusable. I used my hand more in this section than any other on the trail. It was a lot like rock climbing for the 2 miles or so above treeline.We made it work and hit the top despite my gimp ankle, which was feeling slightly better. The tableland section was gorgeous. With views to Baxter peak and the finish line in sight. It took some time to navigate but finally we reached the last small climb. The end was near, and reality set in. Today would be the last. The trail that beat me down and built me up was almost to a close.So many memories with great people, new places and new things. 2189.1 miles of mountains and valleys. So much of the east coast was behind us as we climbed the last steps and touched the sign. We made it. I was so cold and when we finally headed south to meet Bambi's parents. Where I am resting now. The clouds have eaten the mountain completely. Much of the weight has yet to set in. It still feels like a dream. For now I'm going to recover, and eat my weight in food, for I believe thru hiker hunger will stay with me for a while.More to come from the adventure, once I digest it all.So much love for my trail friends and family.
