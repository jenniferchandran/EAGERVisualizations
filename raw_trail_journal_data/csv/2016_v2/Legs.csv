One minute we're a family who hikes, and the next minute we're a family who is going to hike the Appalachian Trail. How did that even happen? My dad started it all. One day he was talking about it, and the next day my mom and my dad decided they were going together. Then my sister, Anna, was talking about it, and now, somehow, we're all going.It took me a while to warm up to the idea. Georgia to Maine. You want me to hike from Georgia...to Maine...GEORGIA TO MAINE!?!What is wrong with you people?!That's like over 2,000 miles!That's like months and months of hiking!That's like half a year!That sounds so hard!That sounds so fun...That sounds life changing...That sounds...amazing!I WANT TO HIKE FROM GEORGIA TO MAINE!",,You think we should WHAT?,"Oct 15, Thu",0
Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520897,"I am a student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst studying Hospitality and Tourism Management in the Isenberg School of Management. I worked hard in high school; I work hard in college; I work hard at my job; I work and work and work in order to prepare for my future. I make sure my resume is up to snuff; I make plans for networking opportunities and possible internships, and I make plans for a myriad of different futures that all have a degree of flexibility...that I have also planned for.Enter CURVEBALL.I'm going to hike the Appalachian Trail. Well, that came out of nowhere. Yes, I've hiked all my life and keep an active lifestyle; however, I don't think I've gone on a camping trip for more than like...three days at a time? I don't know HOW I'm going to do this, but I'm GOING to do this.But what about School?I didn't plan for this-how does this fit into my plans?I will take the spring 2016 semester off, hike all spring and all summer, averaging 15 miles a day, and finish in time for the fall semester.But what if after the trail I don't want to be a Hospitality Major at Umass anymore?It is a possibility that after such a drastic, life-changing experience I won't want to go back...however, I am not going to throw away all the hard work I've done (and all the gazillions of dollars in loans that I've taken out and have been paying for since Day 1). So, I will go back even if it's not what I want to do anymore because I'll only have one year left and maybe I could still use my degree to do what I want and just gear it towards an outdoor lifestyle. Who knows.But what about Money?I'm a college student. Ergo--thousands and thousands of dollars in loans. Ergo--working my ass off to pay them. Ergo--BROKE. Gear is expensive; food is expensive; living is expensive...I don't really have an answer to this category, which actually, really sucks. Since I'm taking a semester off college my ""Grace Period"" for loans will be up in 6 months, so while I'm on the trail even though I'll already be bleeding money, They're just going to take one of those tools embalmers used to pull the person's brains through their noses and do that to me...multiple times...while I'm hiking 20 miles a day. THANKS. THANK YOU.Yeah, yeah, I know, my choice and all. Whatever, it still blows.Really, I've had months to think about this (and my planning mind has already thought of alternatives and alternatives to the alternatives), so my current mindset is that this is what I want to do. This is what will most benefit me and my life. But what about--nothing. I'm doing this.",,But what about...Life?,"Dec 05, Sat",0

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521235,"It's weird. My family is definitely a ""reading family."" My sisters and I grew up listening to our parents read us books, so as I grew up, I was definitely a reader (not nearly as much as my sister Anna though--trail name Verge--she used to be reprimanded for staying up too late reading and her room is basically a library). For a few years, though, my school work, extra curriculars, athletics, and social life got in the way of my reading. If I had free time I would rather have zoned out to some mindless tv show than stick my nose in a book.However, after a while I realized I wanted to start reading more before bed instead of watching tv. I had about a gazillion books on my imaginary list of books I absolutely have to read, but Verge told me I need to scoot this particular series she found to the top of the list. It's called ""Outlander."" I won't tell you what it's about because I went into it having not a clue and was happily hurled into a hectic new world full of adventure and action and history and romance. After I finished the second book, there was such an excruciating cliffhanger that I couldn't bare to know what would happen, so I took a break from the series to read ""The Hobbit"" for the first time. This was back in August when plans for hiking the trail were set into motion, but I still had such doubts in the back of my mind about whether I was actually going to do it. Reading ""The Hobbit"" could not have been more perfect for where I was emotionally at that time. I was put into the shoes of someone being dragged onto a grand adventure, making unlikely friends, and traipsing through the woods in life threatening conditions where you end up finding a new and unquenchable thirst for adventure and, more than that, finding yourself. I felt like Bilbo! I found a new excitement for my journey and a new courage as well.I went back to ""Outlander,"" and I just finished the fourth book in the series (they're each like 800-1,200 pages or so), and I'm still in love--in fact so in love that I felt I needed to take a break because I really really don't want them to end. This time, I read ""The Secret Garden"" because its one of Verge's top three favorite books of all time, and she said there is nothing more pleasant to read (she was right). It not only was pleasant, but it had a greater meaning that I hadn't anticipated: the thoughts that you think mold who you become. (Hopefully I didn't word that too weirdly. It was, again, exactly what I needed to hear (or read)). The more positive thoughts you think and the more you believe you can do something, the more likely it is that you are going to be able to do it. All thoughts of ""what ifs"" and ""buts"" and anything of the sort (if not strictly for logistics and back up plans) is not productive and should not be thought!My determination will help me keep walking through the worst weather conditions.My passion will push me through the times when my legs are shaking with each step I take.My imagination will help me make a game of the days where I feel like I should be in an adventure novel.My love for life will keep me going when I'm in the foulest of moods.Positivity(:As I draw nearer to my start date, I decided a trail book was in order.I started reading ""Becoming Odyssa."" Again, this seems to be perfect for where I am right now.I relate to Jen on so many levels...never done something like this before, don't have much overnight experience at all, don't know what to expect, 21 year old young woman hiking the Appalachian Trail, etc.I'm only on chapter five and already I feel like I've gained so much knowledge and inspiration from her.She'll help me go far...but I'll take myself the rest of the way.So, after reflecting on how perfect all these seemingly random books I've chosen have fit with what I've needed to hear, I've realized that ""Outlander"" fits the theme as well: an adventuring young lady in unknown lands, forging her way through the most chaotic conditions alongside strangers who become companions. It seems to be what I'm attracted to. Maybe it's Fate urging me forward onto this path I've stumbled upon, telling me, ""IT'S RIGHT! GO! DO IT! NOW!"" At this point, I'm all too eager to relent...Alright Fate, give me what you got!",,She'll help me go Pharr,"Feb 03, Wed",0

Neon is spunky and fantastic and had lots of trail wisdom for us!Giuseppe is a Yo-Yoer! My parents met him while they were doing a section of the trail in Maine this summer. I think during the second half of his second Yo-Yo he hurt his knee and had to retire from the trail for a bit. Luckily we got to meet him, and he told us a ton about gear and which hostels and shelters he liked best. I'm so grateful I got to meet with both of them.

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521877,"It's all about mindset. I read something that said that if a week into the trail you're thinking that it was easier than you thought, then you're going to make it to Maine.I've been mentally preparing myself however I can. Some people have said that because the weather has been so wacky and warmer than usual here (New England), then it must be warmer down South! Well...not true. New England is just weird. But also, I'm just going to prepare myself for the worst.Is it possible that it will be 40-50 and sunny and light flurries once in a while and not much snow on the ground and the spring will come sooner than usual? Yes!Am I telling myself that that is how it will be? ABSOLUTELY FRICKEN NOT!I am sincerely imagining myself trudging through a foot or two of snow, with wet feet, through 40mph winds, with sleet pelting my face, which then turns to rain, while I can't feel my hands, and my shoulders are screaming at me, and my butt is numb, and my hamstring is tight, and my soggy feet are causing limp-worthy blisters, and my stove won't light due to low temperatures and wind (and even if it did my hands wouldn't be able to work anyway) and I go to sleep freezing and soggy and in pain and wake up the next day not to a beautiful sunny day that melts away the terrors of the day before but yet another day of exactly the same thing.Obviously there are things you can't prepare for on the trail. I could be wrong about the weather; maybe it will be perfect hiking weather (40, sunny, beautiful). It could be a completely different issue that I hadn't even thought to be preparing myself for. What if it's food? What if Verge and I are grossly underestimating how much we're going to eat? What if my shoes are the worst possible choice I could have made and two days into the trail I want to chop my feet off? Maybe it will be an emotional thing? Maybe Verge will be way more in shape than me and I can't keep up and I get disheartened? WHO KNOWS!But I'm trying as hard as I can to imagine the worst trip possible.

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524211,"Verge and I stayed up until 12am rushing to get everything done.-Did we pack the fuel?-Did we pack the charger?-Did we find that hat?-Did we print the tickets?-Are all the dishes, laundry, trash, and recycling done?-Wanna just do a quick vacuum?-Are our alarms set for 2:50am?That's right--We had to leave for the airport at 3:15am. 3:15!! Ew. Barely 3 hours of sleep.We got to the airport just in time to board our flight to Atlanta (I'm always surprised by how crowded the airport can be at 4am), and we arrived at 9am. Biggest airport ever. Easily found the MARTA (the train) and rode it to the last stop: North Springs, where we were to get picked up by Duffy from the Hiker Hostel. We met a wonderful lady outside the MARTA station named Jeanie who saw we were hikers and said she lived near the trail and would be more than happy to offer us a roof over our heads if we needed it later on in the trail--talk about southern hospitality! Then we met two very nice guys from Hamberg, Germany (Chris and Kay) who were also waiting to get picked up by Duffy. It turns out Kay is a chef and he made us the best ""last meal"" we could ask for (amazing pasta and veggies--he was very sweetly considerate of the fact that I don't eat meat). We decided we'd repay them by supplying the dessert: strawberries and melted chocolate--mmmmmm. Like I said, best last meal ever.So we've met great people and had great food, oh and according to snapchat (a reliable source of course) today was the international day of happiness, which I found quite fitting for the start to our grand adventure, but we are beyond exhausted. From the time we arrived at the hostel (2pm) until dinner time (6pm), we were battling the fatigue. We distracted ourselves by playing Rummy, Crazy Eights, and Bullshit with our new friends. After dinner, we showered (probably for the last time for a while...and now we are long overdue for our beauty sleep (also probably last time sleeping in a bed for a while...)Goodnight world!

Meandered down Springer Mountain through the snow covered holly bushes and into the rhododendrons. My spirit soared as I got to soak in the fact that I was finally on the trail. Every step I was taking was a new step towards my goal: Katahdin (or in the short term--Hawk Mountain Shelter 8 miles up the trail). It was sunny, windy, and about 40 degrees. We decided on 8 miles as a good ""ease into the trail"" day, and it was great. Met so many people today! We kept leapfrogging a couple named Aaron and Stephanie from Tennessee, we met Rootkicker along the trail (he was also aiming for Hawk Mtn). When we got to the shelter people trickled in all day. ""Patriot"" from Massachusetts was there (wahoo MA!), we met SOS (sparkle of sin) and pitch-it (they were hilarious), we also met Pascal and her son (they're from France), Matt the English major from Virginia, spring-breakers from Ohio, and many many others! It turns out the spring breakers go to Miami University in Ohio and I'm pretty sure my second cousins go there and I asked if they knew them and they said they sounded familiar and one of them may have studied abroad with my second cousin Alexandra in Belize! Another crazy story: my co-worker Kaitlyn told me before I left that she knew someone who just had their last day at work and was hiking the trail too so she connected us through Facebook and sure enough she was starting a day before us! Guess who I ran into at Hawk Mountain?? Skooch!! (Aka the woman Kaitlyn referred me to) and ALSO there were two other young men from Massachusetts as well putting the total at 6 people from MA at this one secluded shelter in Georgia (including me and Verge). WOAH. Small world. Anyways, our first water filtering trip and our first cooked dinner (yummy ramen) both went smoothly. Like I said, perfect first day.","Springer Mountain

It was mostly just sunny, windy, and mildly ominous all day though. I was sometimes freaked out by the creaking of the trees because giant fallen trunks are all on and alongside the trail (however unlikely it is that I'll be squished) so I liked to imagine the creaking was just fairies opening and closing their doors high up in the trees. It made everything a lot more pleasant. Setting up the tent in the wind was mildly challenging; filtering our water in the rain was fine but wet; making dinner in the rain was very wet; and doing other things in the rain--also not very fun.

Couldn't stop smiling!When we got there we had a delicious lunch at the restaurant there and got our drop box at the outfitter. Sadly, they had a mouse issue and it ate into our box! Only our trail mix was compromised (eaten and pooped in), but they felt horrible and gave us four free Clif bars! Score!Sat and relaxed in the sun while our feet dried and watched the white water rafters. Hung out with Longstride and Beast more and got to know a nice fellow named Q-tip better (he's part of the ""goon squad""). Beast was kind enough to share his room for a bit so that we could utilize the laundry and showers!!! (Like I said before, he's the FREAKIN' BEST!!!) We also chilled for a bit and watched the movie ""Coming to America"" and ate one of our dehydrated meals. Since we're trying to save money, we didn't think it in our budget to share a room again so soon after our zero day in Franklin, so we decided to trudge on up the hill about 3 miles and just tent by ourselves.

Perfect all the time? Almost! It's great how well we know each other and how we know how to deal with each other when we get pissy (for the most part...)Again, today was beautiful, sunny weather. We had really tough climbing all day though. SO MUCH UP. If it was down, it wasn't like gradual, ""I'm-going-to-give-you-a-break"" down; it was more like ""HA-you're-out-here-for-a-challenge-so-that's-what-you're-going-to-get"" down. Suffice it to say my muscles are tired.Funny story. After a marvelous hour-long lunch break full of reading and pretty views at the top of a very difficult climb, I was on the way down the mountain and I really had to pee. I looked for a good spot and I chose the side that looked like there was more cover. MISTAKE. I had to bushwhack through thorns (by the way--why the hell are there so many of those here?? It's like it's freakin Sleeping Beauty or something. You can't ever stray from the path without getting attacked! They better grow into freakin roses or something otherwise they're just pointless painful prickers penetrating mi piel! {had to go with Spanish to keep that alliteration going} end tangential rant), and then I slid down the hill aways because it was so steep and covered in leaves and afterwards I had to climb all the way back up and kept getting stuck in the prickers and man it was just a big process and I wish I went pee on the other side--even if it meant someone seeing me!But I kept walking. I notice that if something unfortunate happens, you should just keep walking (excluding any serious injuries) because either something lovely will happen that will distract you and put you in a good mood again or something worse will happen and everything will just build and build and, in the end, at least make the day pretty comical (again, excluding any serious injuries or dangers).For example, today it was the butterflies that distracted me and made me happy (along with the snickers bar I ate). The pretty purple butterflies were like Willow-the-Wisps; they'd flutter right in front of me and disappear. Then a few steps later, they'd flutter in front of me again then disappear. It was so peaceful and pretty and comforting.Then the mile that never ended came. The last couple miles you do seem to always take the longest, but this freakin mile--I swear there was some sort of time warp going on. We'd keep going down this horribly steep downhill full of switchbacks and rocks and then it'd take you around the mountain and you'd swear you were hiking that same section again! It was never ending! Anna and I were both so exhausted from the sun and dehydration and exertion. We finally (after what felt like three hours) got to the bottom--Stecoah Gap--and someone had left bananas and apples there for hikers.

It was far, far different from the calm beauty of the wilderness. Then I ate a lot! I had a big dinner (though mostly healthy--a big yummy salad) and ice cream for dessert. We had a big breakfast then we were kinda stuck in Gatlinburg because of shuttle/taxi mis-haps (AKA no one picked up, they were all booked, or they were rude and hung up on me) so we had a big yummy lunch as well (mostly healthy too--hummus and veggies with an amazing veggie goat cheese quesadilla...maybe a few fries too...) But all the extra everything made my body feel horrible (and I had stayed up way too late so I didn't get enough sleep--though the bed and pillows were beyond amazing!!) I just felt so bad. It was accentuated when we finally got driven to Clingman's Dome because the ride is so windy and disgusting and we could barely make conversation with the lovely lady who was driving us. Ug. We didn't get started hiking until 3pm! We supposedly were going to try for 10 miles, but Anna was feeling horrible too. We stopped for a pause at the shelter 4 miles in, but we decided we were starting to feel better by being in the woods again and we would only continue to feel better if we kept hiking.

Then Jingle came and joined us and we all climbed up a different part. It was SO fun! I love climbing things if it's not like above a 5,000 ft drop to my death. It was such a beautiful day (though still cold and slippery from the ice, mud, and melting snow). There were some sunny lathes with beautiful views. We kept running into Jingle all day which was pleasant (he's named Jingle because he collects change on the trail). The whole way reminded me of Mt Moosilauke in New Hampshire. It was piney and mossy and smelled wonderful and was full of rocks and roots and slush. It was GREAT! Just like home! Today was by far my favorite section of the trail (so far).We got to the shelter and met lil Santa, lucky, wook, old drum, crispy, Daniel, Trevor, Rachel, and a few others. Wook had a speaker and played some Green Sky bluegrass music for us. It was, again, utterly pleasant. So my new trail name is Legs because Beast heard Verge calling me Legs (what she always calls me) so it kind of just caught on. I decided the trail had spoken--also your legs are super freakin important for hiking the Appalachian trail. I think it fits well. I like it. So Loon may have started the trail, but Legs is going to finish it! Also, I saw in my guest book that a woman from California is playing a game with her husband, and they're each betting on someone to finish the trail, and she picked me!

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530023,"(My wonderful friend Rob informed me I miscounted my days--two day 26s--so today is actually Day 37! Thanks Rob!)Verge and I started our day with cold oatmeal because we were trying to save fuel. It wasn't that bad! It made packing up go much faster as well. Sweets had two college friends who were going to meet her at the gap in 3 miles and she invited us all to join for a resupply and a pizza trip! They were super nice and that pizza was the best pizza I have ever had--hands down. I promise it wasn't because I'm a hungry thru-hiker. It just happened to be my dream pizza. It was brick oven made with fresh veggies (banana peppers, jalapeños, onions, mushrooms, spinach, garlic, green peppers, black olives, tomatoes) and feta and mozzarella cheese. It was incredible. I ate the whole 12 inch by 12 inch thing. It was fantastic (have I made that clear yet?) then they shared Girl Scout samoas cookies with us and sent us on our way. We also ran into Songbird when we got back from town! He was done for the day though and our day was just beginning! Of course getting out of town means going up a hill, but the pizza empowered me! The carbs, veggies, and cheese mixed with the sugar boost were just what I needed! Until I got hot and sweaty and tired, that is. Then the pizza was a little heavy in my tummy and took some digesting (good work tummy). We then stopped at an awesome tree and Jingle and Verge climbed it! (It looked like a difficult climb). We hiked on and stopped again to take a sunshine break by a water source. Then we stopped again at Joan falls (the blue blaze said it was worth it) and it totally was! The falls were beautiful and refreshing! It started with feet in the water and I just went all the way! Me and jingle played in the water (he's a good adventure buddy) while verge and sweets dipped their feet--verge dipped her head too. We finally continued on (refreshed and soaked), passed the 400 MILE MARK!!!, and got to mountaineer shelter with the thought of going further; however, the company was great (saw ounce and gram and Greg and commando and pack rat joined too!) and it was getting late so we stayed (there was also a 50% chance of rain). I was still full from my pizza, so for dinner I had an apple and a pop tart and some nuts. Friendly conversations about books and movies and tv series and rock climbing and snakes and zero days and tan-lines kept me up until it got dark and chilly and then it was time for bed. Fantastic day.","Doll Flats

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530374,"Went a quick 7 miles this morning before I stopped for a snack. I listened to music the whole morning and it kept me going at a great pace! Made it to the shelter 9 miles in where Jingle, Sweets, Greg, Ounce, and Gram were all having lunch. Verge joined as well. I have felt so lucky so have had such perfect weather so far; however, it comes at a price. The areas I've been hiking through have been going through a drought, creating beautiful hiking weather as well as devastating forest fires. Again, luckily, I've been either in front of them or behind them. Today was the first day I saw evidence of these fires, and it was pretty shocking. Everything was black for miles. All of a sudden the stories I've been hearing came to life. I could see the firefighters escorting the hikers through the flames telling them, ""Run now! There's a quick window! Go!"" And I could imagine how many poor woodland creatures were lost to the flames. It was really sad. I truly appreciate all the work the trail maintainers have done so quickly as well as the firefighters. It's truly amazing. On a happier note, we got to kincora hostel and got our drop box and met Bob Peoples! He's a terrifically friendly wealth of knowledge who is generous and kind. We debated staying there but we had plans to meet Sweets and Jingle at the Laurel Fork shelter. We got there just before a huge roaring thunderstorm passed over, and we all enjoyed the Oreos we'd brought for everyone (dipped in peanut butter of course). Perhaps we'll have time to go swimming somewhere in the river tomorrow! Aiming for Damascus by Saturday!","Mountaineer Shelter

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530921,"So although the lightning was beautiful last night, the storm did a good job making sure I didn't get enough sleep. Verge and I both had a hard time getting going in the morning. Jingle and sweets were long gone by the time we started thinking about getting out of our sleeping bags. The morning only got harder after that. Laurel fork shelter is on top of a steep rocky hill, and I tripped down that steep rocky hill...luckily I'm a ninja and caught myself...but I got a little bruised in the process. Then verge and I were going to take a quick morning dip in the river before we got going (she felt really gross from numerous showerless days); however, after she got in a ways, lost a flip flop to the rapids and saw a potentially venomous water snake...I decided I wasn't that dirty after all... When we finally got water (our steripen wasn't working properly so we used our aqua Mira) we were able to get hiking--by now it was 11:30am and we had a 19 mile day planned. A big climb (pond ""flats"") and a quick swim in Watauga Lake later, it was four o'clock at a beautiful dam (pictured above) just past creepy bear territory and we still had 10 miles left. The day was dragging and the terrain was strenuous. Verge said she felt like a dalek--just wanting to exterminate everyone in sight. I felt more like a cyberman--my mind and body on autopilot as I trudged up the miles and miles of hill. I thought to myself, maybe I would distract myself by thinking of a movie I know really well so it'll be like I'm watching a movie! When I was about to do just that, I realized that it was golden hour on a beautiful mountain with brilliantly green leaves surrounding me and a light breeze full of sunshine and floral scents and why the hell would I want to distract myself from that? Would I seriously rather be at home on the couch watching a movie? Maybe catch me on a more hormonal day and I'd say yes, but nosireebob not today! It was perfect out! I tried to spread the positivity as much as I could in Verge's direction but unfortunately she was still feeling more like a dalek...We got to vandeventer shelter (after attempting to get water from a murky source that had tadpoles in it...)and could have stopped but instead had a quick dinner and pushed on! We planned to go four more miles but it quickly got dark and we got to about 2.5 more miles, making it an 18 miles day. A really hard 18 mile day at that! There's definitely something mentally draining about hiking later in the day like that. I think I don't like it as much. Well deserved rest!","Laurel Fork Shelter

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530922,"FIRST 20 MILE DAY!Because we tented at a random site, we had to quickly get going in the morning to get my dehydrated body some water and breakfast. Luckily we were only 1.5 from water, so we hydrated, ate, and called our grandparents because we found out that they're going to come visit! Hallelujah! I find that I talk about them a lot on the trail. Their farmhouse in New Hampshire is the epitome of home to me. I love it and them and all my memories there. I also found out they're going to see my parents first, then take my mom off trail to come see us as well while Bombadil gets some bigger miles in! Perfect timing so close to Mother's Day! It was spectacular hiking weather today with lovely gradual terrain and a couple neat cow pastures (definitely got angrily mooed at). Verge and I met Hoodie and Bald Eagle and Jim and played leapfrog with them all day. We stopped for a lunch at double springs shelter where I developed intense and unfortunate stomach pains that lasted for a painful 4-5 miles after lunch. I still have yet to uncover why the peanut butter and tortilla sandwich made my tummy so angry. I bet it was the two-three days of being dehydrated. The last few miles were more fun, but that last mile on a 20 mile day was pretty rough. We were really trying to come up with something to talk about to distract each other. The most successfully distracting topics were almost always food--and even then, usually desserts. We discovered we were craving a light and delicious berry cobbler with vanilla ice cream. Mmmmmm.I also discovered my least favorite things to do when I'm exhausted and thirsty and tired are throw the bear bag rope and also go down a steep hill to get water. Blah. Once I got my amazing cheddar broccoli rice side and hot cocoa in me though, I was able to enjoy the lovely company. Greg/Hammer was there along with Training Wheels, Mr.Blue (who we found out knows Bombadil and Goldberry!!), Wally, and Hamwise. Also met Irie and his buddy and a couple weekenders.I do just need to mention one more time how much I enjoyed that cheddar broccoli rice side. It was exactly what my body wanted. Yay cheesy comfort food full of carbs and calories! The cocoa was just the cherry on top. Yum. 20 miles. Super proud of myself.","Random Tentsite

We had a package waiting and the post office is only open 9-11am on Saturdays! Hiked the 10.5 miles into Damascus in just over three hours! After getting our package, we had to find a place to stay. Saw that the woodchuck hostel had ten dollar tenting and a two dollar breakfast so we went to go check it out! It was a very cute place with a nice backyard and a basketball hoop. Unfortunately, it was 10 per person but still pretty cheap. Training wheels, hammer, jingle, sweets, shiv, tumbleweed, hamwise, beast, Longstride, and chef were all there! I like that we keep seeing the same people and getting to know them better and better. Everyone is so great. I met Panda and Catfish and played HORSE with them. I missed basketball! I also met Firecat/GPS/View--apparently people can't decide what to call him so I asked what he preferred and he said ""whatever"" so I decided ""whatever"" would be a good name for him and he liked it! Haha Tumbleweed and shiv decided they thought it'd be a good idea for everyone to pitch in a few dollars for a grocery store run and they'd cook for us! It was a FANTASTIC veggie medley and salad and sausages (I had a portobello mushroom instead of the sausage). It was soooo good--pictured above. We finished it off with an apple pie and ice cream dessert. Afterwards, a few of us went to the brewery where there was foosball and live music! Songbird came and joined us there later as well after having hiked 26 miles! Lots of rain! Zero day tomorrow.","Abingdon Gap Shelter

I loved my waffle, and I also indulged in some Apple Jacks! Haven't had those in forever--yum! I also had hot cocoa and stuck a few banana slices in it and it was super good. Hung out on the porch with my cocoa and watched the rain. When it cleared up a little, Verge and I went into town to explore. Lots of stuff was closed because it was pretty early on a Sunday morning in a tiny town, but we made it to a couple outfitters and to Mojo's coffeehouse which had a great atmosphere and food! I ordered their huevos rancheros there for lunch (pictured above) and Verge had a salad (her stomach has been bothering her for a couple days). We ran into Hamwise and Big Stick at Mojo's and hung out with them for a while. They're two fellow New Englanders! (Both from Vermont). Hamwise is quite the character. He walks around nonchalantly in the dirt with his socks on, runs down any and all downhills, and I also noticed he not only doesn't have a pillow but he slept with his face on the shelter floor--a bold move! Big Stick is super friendly and fun to hang out with as well. We walked back to the hostel with them, and the weather had much improved! It was so sunny I felt like I was getting sunburnt--I probably was!After doing more zero-day chores (calling Verizon being one), verge and I walked to food city to get a couple things for dinner. We made delicious veggie filled wraps (and met the Mayor of Damascus--super nice guy!)Sundance, Muffinman, Scarecrow, and Romeo all showed up today. I taught Sundance how to play solitaire--he'd never played before! How does that even happen?? Then I taught him speed solitaire and he, Hamwise, and I all played together. People were drawn in and at one point we had five people playing at once! It was awesome (Sassy and scarecrow joined). Big stick joined the card playing as well so we switched to Bullshit and then eventually to ERS (Egyptian Rat Screw?) not a huge fan of that one. Scarecrow got in trouble for having booze on premises--woodchuck has strict rules against it due to previous issues they've had. Luckily Songbird said we should go join him and Foot at the Old Mill to play cards there, so a few of us adventured over there and learned how to play Scumbags and Warlords (another card game). We then switched to Kings, where I learned that Foot can speak some Russian. Sweet! A fellow linguist--wannabe! I think the highlight of the day was totally teaching Sundance how to play speed solitaire and watching him get addicted to it. So fun!","Woodchuck Hostel

So fun! Got Sundance addicted (he'd never played solitaire and now he can't stop!) Verge sent home some of our stuff (yay lighter pack) and I packed up a bit but was slow going. I met Columbus and Footlong. Columbus does a lot of traveling and plays guitar! Footlong plays the ukulele, so we got some live music! It was so nice out after more rain that I just wanted to hang out and relax and have a beautiful happy day, so I convinced Verge to let me play more and said we'd have lunch then go...but then I convinced her we didn't have to do the full 15 miles, we could just do 9 miles and hang out longer (I was way too happy and relaxed to leave yet--it felt less stressful than yesterday--I don't know why; the vibes were just happier). So she read a fun book she found at the hostel and I read my book (Interview with the Vampire by Anne Rice), but then Songbird and Foot came along and distracted me. I taught Songbird how to play speed solitaire (though he was VERY much resisting at first) and the three of us (Songbird, Sundance, and I) played it while Columbus and Footlong were jamming out as background music with Songbird occasionally joining in with his harmonica. I was so happy. Then I built card houses and listened to songbird sing and play guitar (pictured--Foot on the left and Songbird on the right). Finally it was time for a hike. We mosied out of town by 4 after buying batteries and getting a fruit smoothie, and it thundered the whole way on our climb but the rain held off until about 6. We got to Saunders shelter by 7:30ish where we found sweets, jingle, and hamwise there playing hearts! Wheels, irie, turtle, and hungry Dave were there too. Yummy dinner, rainy bearbagging, generous friends sharing water so we didn't have to brave the rain to go get some. Nice privvy--room to change in there. They made room for us in the shelter--again, so nice of them. So excited for my Grandparents and my mom to come tomorrow!! Hope it won't be too hard to meet up with them.Again, my soul is so full and happy. Walking out of town, I felt my joy just radiating from me.

(Trail days is the biggest AT festival of the year where current and previous hikers all gather to see each other and have fun at random events and promotions from companies and to see trail celebrities speak) So, the plan is for Verge to stay and recover and do Work for Stay while I go off to trail days in Damascus. I feel very odd leaving her behind because we've been together all day every day for this whole trip! But perhaps a day apart would be good for our sisterly relations. So I'm getting a ride to trail days via firecat and his brother who is driving all the way down from Jersey to visit! The hostel cleared out for the morning, and I hung out with Firecat and read my book. Then it cleared up outside and was so sunny and the birds were singing and I was hanging out in the sun while ranger Rick (who arrived in the afternoon) was playing the ukelele (pictured above) and firecat was playing fetch the the dogs. It was incredibly wonderful and relaxing.Firecat's brother was supposed to come around 3:30 but got stuck in traffic and didn't get there until 8:30! Bah what a long day of driving that must have been! So we (Firecat and his brother and cousin and my new friends Lupine and Pokey and myself) all went on our way on the 2 hour drive to Damascus (we stopped for food at the waffle house) and didnt get in until about 11:30! We navigated the crazy, loud, and muddy ""tent city"" until we found spots for us.Sadly, we realized we rented right in a bunch of poison ivy and stinging nettles but...we'll survive!

Turns out we tented right near a bunch of my friends! (Sweets, Jingle, Big Stick, Training Wheels, Sundance, Songbird, etc.) So Sweets, Training Wheels, and I went to go explore and pick up her package (she was sent chocolate and a feather boa which she proceeded to wear all day--pictured above).Tons of free raffles all day! I won a free shirt and a new buff! Wahoo!Then an awesome thing happened to me; I was walking through the fair and someone pulled me aside and told me they recognized me from my blog!! He said he'd chosen ten people to follow and I was the only one still on the trail. I was blown away. 1: it's so cool he recognized me out of a crowd 2: it's incredible that I'm one out of ten people still on the trail! That's quite the confidence boost. I'm very proud of what I've been able to accomplish so far, but I definitely do not take it for granted. Best wishes to all who have been injured or have had to come off the trail, and I hope you are able to come back! (And pleasure speaking with you Gary!)Then there was the hiker parade! I got to see tons of people I haven't seen in a while! I saw Livia and Dante and the navy boys (now known as Logic, Chris Rock, and Mayo--Bear Marshall had to get off trail). I also saw Pitch it and SOS! I was so glad to see them again--I'd been wondering how they were doing! I also saw Chef Ducky and Weebles (I'd camped with them my first night on the trail) and Mountaineater! It was fun seeing all the town spray the hikers with squirt guns--as tradition calls for, of course.Had a delicious burrito and ice cream and got free new socks because mine had holes in them, got awesome new shorts and checked options for new shoes too!Hung out with the goon squad and part of ""quest"" and I got to meet jingle's friends Chris, Brett, Chad, and Devon. They were super nice! Chris (or Vice) hiked the trail a few years ago!Then there was hiker prom!! Sweets, Jingle, Training Wheels, Uno, Songbird, and I all danced away to the live country music band. It was awesome! Lucky and Lil Santa were there too and we voted for them for prom king and queen. Lil Santa won king but a male hiker in drag won queen (too funny). A quick visit to the old mill to see Tumbleweed and Shiv and their buddies from Ohio and then we were off to tent city! Tent city is insane! It's a crazy, chaotic little network of muddy paths in the woods by town and there are tons of mini tent communities all laid out. There were tons of gatherings of sub-parties in the tent city and a big fire with a drum circle and dancing! It was so fun! Sweets and I enjoyed speaking in British accents and confusing everyone. Jingle and I danced in the fire circle for a while and tried to get Sundance and Songbird to join in as well (medium success--they danced for a little).So much fun! So little sleep...so worth it!","Trail Days!

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533535,"So I had a SET plan. I even had a plan B. I EVEN had a plan C!!! But guess what...things don't go as planned.Firecat and his brother had said they could drive Lupine, Pokey, and me back to the hostel Sunday morning, which worked great in me and Verge's plans; however, it turned out his brother wasn't having much fun at trail days. But ""have no fear!"" he says, his friends are driving down from Jersey as well and if his brother leaves early his friends will drive us Sunday! Jingle's friends even told me that I could ride in their truck if I needed a ride. There you have it: plans A, B, and C. Well, his brother did leave early because he didn't have fun, and his friends had even less fun and refused to hang out there and forced him to leave with them at 1 in the morning! That really stinks for Firecat...but he kinda forgot to tell me...so I woke up to him gone, texted him and Jingle and Sweets to see when they planned on leaving but they didn't reply. I went to check out their tentsite and saw that they too had gone already. Well then! Next step is to contact Verge, but I knew she didn't have service at the hostel so I called the hostel and found out she was hiking into Pearisburg without me and would meet me there. Since Lupine and Pokey were in the same situation, we all hung out and tried to figure out the best course of action (while eating delicious food at Mojo's). Turns out we decided hitching was the best option.We were about to leave when I ran into Pitchit, His wife (Anne I believe is her name), Trail Mama, and SOS. I spoke with them for a bit, mentioned our predicament and SOS and Trail Mama decided they would drive us! I was floored! How could this have worked out so perfectly after all the plan fails??? The trail delivers! But that's not all! Trail mama and SOS filled the car ride with entertaining conversation and fun stories and even bought us mcflurries. They're fantastic. What amazing trail magic. (Me, Trail Mama, Lupine, Pokey pictured above). They drove us right to the trail head by woods hole (not easy to get to!) Now it was four o'clock and I had 11 miles to hike to Verge.That's not all either. Verge was getting antsy about me being so late and not knowing where we were going to stay or if we'd hike on on the trail. Turns out she was shopping and a woman asked if she was a hiker and if she had somewhere to stay tonight. She mentioned she was working on a start up hostel and Verge (and I) could stay there if she just helped paint part of it. What?! How perfect is that?? So Verge painted for a couple hours and I got there by about 8-8:30! (A super enjoyable and beautiful hike with a lovely view and beautiful trees and mountainside lit up by golden hour). We basically had a whole house just to ourselves! We got to have a shower and do laundry and then Verge and I proceeded to have a lovely pasta sides dinner while watching the second season of Kimmy Schmidt on Netflix. It was bliss. The trail delivers.","Trail Days!

Had lunch (hummus and pita chips and potato salad mmmmm) and then realized that the hardware store which has fuel we need was closed because the owners in surgery (wish you well!) We found a couple other hikers and asked if they maybe knew where else we could get some and they successfully pointed us in the right direction (right down the street there was a mini hiker shop).Verge was feeling horrible all day. She gets really bad cramps and has to use the bathroom quite frequently. I feel so bad for her. She's been on the antibiotics for 3 days now and still isn't feeling better. Anyone know how long it usually takes for the symptoms to go away? The docto had said you feel immediate relief...maybe it's not giardia? We don't know. Only time will tell.She craved Dairy Queen (not normal for Verge), so we split an amazing peanut butter cookie dough blast blizzard. Woah. I need more of THOSE in my life.We chilled and I finally updated my blog, and I got to talk to Bombadi on the phone (my dad). Yay! I miss that guy...and nope, still haven't caught them...they're like almost 200 miles ahead. They're BEASTS! Go parents! Anyways, we didn't leave until like four and, again, Verge didn't feel well (and my feet are adjusting to new shoes--oh yeah, new shoes!

Got to Bailey gap shelter and not quite enough room in shelter so we decided if we had to tent might as well push on anyway. Got a little hangry. Possibly even got sunburnt through the clouds. Finally both fed up and hangry and was going to get dark so we tented somewhere weird and random and definitely rocky and had sticks and was slanted but we figured it out.

Then I enjoyed my own company for a while before running into Chicken Feet from Long Island (he's a riot--we'd met multiple times before). Then I got to the bottom of the hill and ran into spaghetti legs and sushi. The shelter was so far off the trail! Sadly, there was no shelter space and we really needed to dry out our nasty wet tent anyway so we tented.

A few times I really needed to use my hands and my poles were just in the way so I threw them on the ground in front of me. Then we finally got to four pines. I had a very positive first impression...but it went kinda downhill from there in terms of their communication skills. And anger. Both the driver and the owner both had meltdowns over very small issues...we were a very laid back, quiet group so I found it surprising and a little distasteful. However, the community feel, the shared loads of laundry, the free sodas and warm cookie bars, free shuttle to the home place restaurant, and the fact that it's donation based pretty much made up for the scary uncalled for outbursts. I ate way way too much at home style restaurant but it was delicious. I then had a ton of fun playing lots of cards with great P. There were so many people we knew there (ETA, Joker, Terrible Lizard, Les Mayo, a few warrior hikers, Chicken Feet, Gamel, Sprinkle Toes, Crisco, etc.).

They also already have a small tear...I finally made progress on enrolling in classes for next semester! I was definitely having trouble/procrastinating that. Luckily I believe it will all work out. I just need a course override form for one of my classes because it's currently full but I really need to take that class. Anyway, that's a huge weight off my shoulders.We took so long getting out of town today. Verge was feeling off (emotionally) so I had a spontaneous dance party to cheer her up (it worked)(the song was Switzerland by Last Bison). We also took a lot of breaks and fantastized a lot about the future. We decided when we get home, we're going to have a day once a week where we dress up and do something fun (like a sisterly-date-night type thing). We also talked about future goals and fun adventures we want to have.

Virginia has been lovely. In general, I've noticed it smells amazing! Maybe it's just the time of year, but flowers are blooming everywhere and my nostrils are certainly very happy. I think the little white blossoms smell the best (unsure what they are). There are also TONS of humongous rocks in Virginia. I really like it sometimes, and other times...not so much. Dragons tooth was fun to climb on though, and once a ""monolith"" (or so Guthooks called it) protected me from a sudden downpour.

Anyway, the next morning, Lassie, Outback, and Odyseeus called the shuttle guy to leave, but Verge and I stayed for a bit and ended up running into Jingle, Sweets, Tumbleweed, Shiv, and their friend who was visiting! It was a lovely surprise. Then a guy came by the shelter and asked if anyone needed a ride in a half hour! Perfect timing! We both squeezed in another shower, and we're ready when he arrived.

So someone tried to fumble around and tap the starter from underneath, but that didn't work either. We were resigned to call the shuttle guy when Jingle saunters out from his lunch break at Scotto's fiddles with something quickly and the car started! Thank goodness for Magical Jingle!

It reminded me a lot of the Ale House (where I used to work)! We finally got to see the jungle book (thanks to a ride from a trail angel who offered us a ride named John)! It wasn't quite as good as we had hoped, but it was still fun to watch, chitchat, and eat movie candy. Got a call from the dad and he updated us that they got to Pennsylvania! (And they said they'd be staying in a hotel in Waynesboro, PA to celebrate so we'd both be in Waynesboros--pretty nifty). We were definitely debating just zeroing, but why not get back to the trail? So, we called a trail angel (Mr. Gizmo) and got back to the trail that night at 7:30pm and walked as far as we wanted until we found a nice little spot to set up. It was only four miles, but at least we were back in the woods and had entered the Shenandoahs! As a side note, it's funny how quickly we can go from being in playful moods to being grumpy. Also, bear-bagging in the dark is the bane of my existence. Or really just bear-bagging in general. I swear I'm getting worse and worse at it.","Church Hostel

An increase of spontaneous dance parties is in order!Verge and I were about a mile or so away from the next shelter when we got caught in a downpour! This is the first REAL rain is say we've been caught in. It was awesome!! We just sang and trudged through the streams as rain poured down our faces into our mouths. I loved it. I couldn't stop smiling.We stopped at the shelter for water and decided to stay in order to (try to) dry off. Fun people! Met Myles, New Hampshire bob, storyteller (who knows Bombadil and Goldberry!), tree, diatom, mola, and saw mountain goat, sleeping beauty, dolly, and farmer.

We got so relaxed and preoccupied we actually stayed there for like three or four hours! By the time we finally got going we were debating only doing 6 more miles, making it only a 13 mile day; however, when we got to the next shelter and it was only about 5:30ish, we decided to do dinner and continue on. The Shenandoahs are so mystical. The crazy amounts of green brush and vines and little white flowers and dense dense forest make me feel like I got transported into a world of fairies and elves or something; it's fantastic! I saw a bear and five deer today! Awesome. So, we run into a lot of people who always ask about how it is to hike with your sibling. They always say, ""I'd never be able to do that; we'd kill each other!"" Well, thankfully, Verge and I are very close and know each other very very well; in fact, she's one of my best friends! I typically can sense her moods so well that I know what things I can and can't get away with in a given moment; however, it seems we either are just spending way too much time together or maybe our hormones are out of whack, but lately, yes, sibling stuff has been more difficult. It's only taken about 900 miles, but it's happening.

Hiked with great p today and relaxed at a picnic area, listened to the ominous thunder, and stopped at the camp store for ice cream (it was so good), and then we got poured on!

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536749,"Had a relaxing morning and left around 9:30 with the intention of hiking 22 miles; however, the thing about the Shenandoahs is that there are so many distractions! Verge and I hiked 8 miles to Big Meadows Campground and were once again tempted by laundry and showers because although we had just done laundry and showers two days ago, we hiked a big day and got rained on which pretty much automatically means you stink again. It was terrific. The shower was so warm and so worth it.Sadly, it was getting later and it'd been raining (again) so we cut our day short--by ten miles! That pretty much never happens. We feel a lot of pressure to do bigger miles so that I can be done in time for school in the fall (and so that we can catch our dad), so days shorter than 15 miles pretty much always make us uncomfortable these days (unless it's an ""into town"" day). I've been loving the Shenandoahs for the beauty and terrain, but there are just so many non-thru-hikers and random stops with luxuries, and it just is so different from the rest of the trail that it confuses me! I don't know if I like it. If I was more relaxed about miles maybe I'd enjoy it more? Anyway, even through the rain and the weird miles, I'm still going strong in the happy department! Don't let the fretting fool you! I enjoy every day. I enjoy the sweaty hard work up the hills, the beating of the downhills on my feet, the heavy rain as it pours down my face, the sense of community and family on the trail, the peaceful quiet of the woods around you when you're alone, the companionship with the wildlife, being able to think about how I feel in a given moment or what fun adventures the future will bring, being able to bond with people I meet on the trail, being able to practice patience and communication, being able to hang out with my sister (whether it's quarreling or laughing) and so much more! I have so much to look forward to as well. In just about one week I'll be in Harper's ferry--the mental halfway point of the AT. Just about one week after that my mom is coming down to visit us, slack pack us a day or two, do trail magic, and celebrate my birthday! Probably a week after that (or so?) I'll be close enough to visit Kate in Pennsylvania! She's been such a great support for me on the trail. Just today I got to talk to her on the phone! It was lovely. Every day there's something to look forward to. I love it. I'm happy. Side note: this just in--there's a guy at the shelter who uses mousetraps at shelters, and he set one up and caught two mice in one trap! Then he set up another and caught two more mice in that one! It's mostly sad, but also a little humorous because besides Verge and me, the shelter is full of guys, and they all crowd around the traps and watch the mice get caught. Boys! Seriously? Goofs. Also, beautiful sunset.","Bearfence Mountain Hut

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537172,"I actually woke up early for once! (6am)The shelter boys from last night were Princess Peach, Mountain Goat, Happy Feet (from Germany), Napster (from Germany), and the comical mouse-murderer Pharmacist. Jelly also kept us company but he tented down the hill with his awesome hiking companion, Maggie, aka Peanut Butter, aka his cute puppy. They were a fun group. Verge and I were wondering how far we should go, and we settled on aiming for 22.5 miles to get to Elkwallow wayside for a couple of granola bars for the next day. We thought that it closed at 5:30pm, so we got going!Today was MARVELOUS! Finally no rain! It was sunny and breezy and perfect! Verge and I happily hiked along, and we actually got a couple views on the way! I upped my bear count to six so far! My deer count is way too high for me to remember; they're everywhere, and they're so friendly and not afraid of us at all. Verge and I hiked with Pharmacist for a while (man, he's fast!), but he was stopping off in Luray and we were continuing on. Somewhere along the line, we made a joke about going the whole way to the next shelter, which would be 28.5 miles for the day...but we were definitely just joking!Verge and I got to the Elkwallow wayside at 4:20pm! That means we hiked 22.5 miles in 7.5 hours! Pretty cool. We got there and soon realized that it was open until 7pm...but that means we could just relax! I wanted to eat everything in the whole store. I settled for a banana and a milkshake (we cooked our dehydrated meal for dinner). At the wayside I met Kanuck! (My parents hiked with him for a while) I also met ROC Steady and a couple who reads my blog! They recognized my picture and told me they keep up with my whole family on the trail! I couldn't believe it! I think it's so cool when that happens! (Thank you for your kind words and support--it's so appreciated!)Jelly and Maggie (Peanut Butter) joined us at the wayside, and we hung out with them for a bit. Jelly is from Boston! Always fun to meet fellow Massachusettsians (it's a thing; let it happen). Verge and I left at 6:30pm deciding to push the final 6 miles to the shelter! 28.5?! What?! Can we really do it?!Answer: YES!! We banged out those last 6 miles in two hours. (The milkshake must have really energized me). The shelter was so crowded! Luckily, there was room in the shelter! (Lots of people tented). We saw Outback, Lassie, Odysseus, and Spaghetti Legs. We also saw Napster! He decided to do the 28.5 miles as well! Awesome. Lots of mice at this shelter. Where's Pharmacist the Exterminator when you need him? Just kidding. Mice are cute. (P.S. the pharmacist murdered 15 mice at that last shelter. 15!!! Downright genocide.)

Verge and I took our time and took many breaks because we only had 14 miles to go and had to be there by 2:30 for the trolley into town, so we leapfrogged Napster and Chicken Feet all day on our gorgeous, relaxing hike.We were having a snack with Chicken Feet and talking about Front Royal plans (we were planning to go in and hike four miles out), but Chicken Feet told us about how his nephew was coming to pick him up and bring him to their house in Fairfax (about an hour away), and he invited us to join!! Verge and I decided this was amazing trail magic and we had no reason not to! We all arrived at the trolley stop, and we talked to Chicken Feet about his life while we waited for the trolley (had an hour plus to spare). He told us all about his family and their struggles with the Vietnam war and refugee camps and escaping to France, Germany, and the U.S. He talked about how many of his family members are very successful now because they worked so hard. It's one thing to know the things that had happened to people during that time, but it's another thing entirely to hear it firsthand from someone you know! I feel amazed by is experiences and thoroughly inspired as well.We took the trolley to the post office, accompanied by Chicken Feet, and we were walking to find a place to have lunch when a couple pulls over and asks if we want a ride! They took us to a place called ""Spelunker's"" because they were heading their for lunch anyway! They invited us to join them and we chatted and enjoyed a delicious lunch! (I had a veggie sandwich and fries). The man (a principal at a school) even bought us ice cream! Amazing trail magic! They were so kind and fun to have lunch with. I'm truly taken aback by the kindness and generosity that I continue to find along the way.After lunch, we hung out in the sun outside and waited for Chicken Feet's nephew and wife to arrive. In the meantime, I got to talk to Bridget on the phone! I miss her so much! She's been an amazing friend and cheerleader to me while I'm out here. She might even come hike with us for a while!! (I hope). A couple nice ladies having lunch outside chatted with us and asked us questions about the trail as well. Finally Ming and Chong arrived and took us out to eat for dinner at a Vietnamese restaurant in Fairfax! It was amazing! I absolutely love Vietnamese food, so this was quite the treat. They even treated us to dessert too! I can't believe the day we're having!We arrive at their beautiful house and they give us abloom and a bathroom to ourselves! We even got to do laundry! Later, when we were waiting for our laundry to finish they even made us goody bags with chocolate, dates, and ramen and seaweed. I can't believe their generosity. Thank you Chicken Feet!!!

After breakfast (where we met Murph and Mudpuppy), we had a lengthy conversation with him about hospitality, nutrition in the U.S., and societal trends in the working world. It was so interesting! We then took our time packing up and checking out (while watching the end of Horton hears a Who), and we tried our hand at hitching!

The doctor decided it was most likely Lyme disease, so she will start a cycle of doxycycline and get the actual test results in the next day or two (about Lyme). It seems the tests for Lyme are pretty unreliable though, so hopefully the antibiotics will help. Unfortunately, the antibiotics have side effects (stomach problems and fatigue), so even the process of feeling better won't feel very good. Verge has such a positive attitude and, of course, there's no such thing as a day off for her! ""But can I still hike tomorrow?"" She asked.We got dropped off at the same road crossing (Ridge road), and we hiked along on some terrifically flat and pine-needley terrain. There were even some parts today that reminded us of our childhood home! We reached the official halfway point! We almost passed it! I sang Bon Jovi as loudly as I could, ""WOOOOAH WE'RE HALFWAY THERE WOOOOOAH LIVIN' ON A PRAYER!!!"" Then, all of a sudden, the sky got ominously dark. The sky opened up and poured on us. Sadly, another side effect of the antibiotics is skin sensitivity, so the raindrops actually were hurting Verge's skin! Crazy! I felt so bad. There was nothing I could do to help! Again, she made it seem like it was no big deal and continued on. I enjoyed the rain, and I enjoyed even more when the rain cleared up and the sun came out. 2 miles from the Pine Grove Furnace, Verge told me to run ahead if I wanted so that I could catch up with our buddies and start the half gallon challenge!I sprinted down the trail (super fun with the flatter terrain!!) and got there to see Sweets, Great P, and the male Tumbleweed just starting!

She then dropped us off at Pine Grove Furnace to start ""real"" hiking again. No more of this slack packing business! (I'll miss my little robot backpack from the dollar general). Verge wasn't feeling stellar, and we decided I would do the 19 miles to boiling springs and have my little 21st birthday party with all my buddies who were planning to meet me there, and she would stay at the shelter right before town (a 15 mile day) and rest up as much as she could. It was sad to leave her, but I ended up having a lovely day of hiking by myself on my birthday. I went my own pace and listened to music and sang and had a wonderful day!

I ordered my first drink (a Guinness), and a gentleman at the bar heard it was my birthday and he bought my first drink! All my friends were so sweet to me all night, and I had such an amazing time. We ran into Odie (the hiker yearbook guy) and he took a picture of all of us and hung out with us later at the campground! I also got to know Splinter better. After we left the bar, we walked back and the moon was so fantastically bright. Then the stars started to come out, and the fireflies lit up the woods. It was a marvelous night for a moondance.What a magical birthday. Thank you to all who helped to make it a special day.","Pine Grove Furnace

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538877,"Enjoyed a lovely breakfast at Cafe 101 with Sweets, Jingle, and Training Wheels (Sweets was not feeling well at all again--possibly from the ice cream challenge). (Pictured above: Sweets and me at the tavern the previous night for my birthday) Verge joined us in the morning and was feeling much better! We got our box from the post office and went through it at the ATC HQ. I had left my stuff at the campground, so I went with Sweets to go get it (she'd left her stuff too). On our way back, we ran into trail magic! (Let the birthday celebrations continue!!) I chatted with the angels and found out they'd not only both hiked the AT before, but the girl (sadly, I forget her name) has hiked the AT, PCT, and is currently doing the CDT and was just taking a break! Going for the Triple Crown! Awesome!I finally got back to Verge and the ATC, and we dilly-dallied our way out around 2:30 with our new buddy Waterfall. Jingle and Wheels had already left, and Sweets decided to wait out her hurting stomach at the new town hostel. It was a ridiculously hot day, and we left at the hottest possible time! The terrain was nice and flat, but I got scorched through farmers' fields. (Definitely wore sunscreen though.) Waterfall was good company, but at Scott's Farm ATC HQ we parted ways and I decided I'd wait for Verge. She didn't show up for quite a while; she got there past 7 and we still had four more miles until the next shelter (with no stealth camping in between). She said she'd hit a wall, so I called up the lady at the hostel in boiling springs (I had her number because Sweets had left her phone at the ATC and I knew she'd gone to the hostel so I called to let her know where to pick it up) and she said she had room for us, but she didn't know where our location was. I saw a local with his wife and daughter hiking up from the river nearby and I went to ask them for a landmark and they said they'd drive us to meet her somewhere halfway! I couldn't believe our perfect timing and luck. The family was so incredibly nice and asked lots of questions, and I really enjoyed their company and friendliness. We met up with Lisa from the hostel and she was great too! (So funny!!) We got back to boiling springs and got to see Sweets (I made her some grilled cheese to make her feel better.) We also saw Husker, Lassie, One Feather, and Sequoia and I met Alan. We could hear the country music concert going on nearby. Bedtime! I'm so thankful things worked out.","Boiling Springs Campground

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538883,"I woke up in a bad mood. I think I'd had dreams that put me in a funk.What to do? We wanted to surprise Bombadil for Father's Day by shuttling (or something) up to him, but it seemed we didn't have very good options (timing and money didn't quite match up). So when that didn't seem like it was going to work out that also bummed me out. I also felt like we weren't making much progress hiking lately, but it's totally understandable with Verge's Lyme disease and my birthday shenanigans...all of it just put me in such a bad mood.We thankfully were able to get back to where we left off, and we decided we'd try to hike to Duncannon (15ish miles). It was a 90 degree day again. You know, when I worked on mentally preparing myself for the worst conditions, I was imagining horrible cold snow and rain and freezing temperatures and bears and snakes and everything I could think of! Guess what I didn't think of? The heat. This fair skinned, New England girl does NOT do well in the heat. Today was awful. I completely lost my appetite (not that the melted trail mix that tasted like soap was that appealing anyway--baby wipes had been in the same drop box affecting the flavor...) and I almost puked three times for whatever reason. I kept drinking water, but it didn't seem like my body was absorbing it; it'd go right through me or I'd sweat it out in buckets. Gross. Also, moisture seeking bugs? Awesome. Anyway, Verge and I got so tired we were in delirious mode; everything was funny and we were tripping over our own feet. We got to town, and I was starving (my appetite came back with a vengeance). We walked right up to the Doyle (legendary Duncannon AT hotel and restaurant that we were excited for) and found out it had closed the restaurant at 6pm because it's Sunday...it was 6:15. So close. So we went further down the trail, stopped at a quick mart, and headed to the campground (our plan for where we were staying that night--only $5!) Sadly, it was another mile through town, so we're on our last legs of energy, I'm SO hungry and my back is starting to hurt, but we made a game of counting how many churches we passed on this one street in town (8 churches, a Mary st., Rebecca st., Rachel st., 2 funeral homes, and a Cemetary st.) all on the same ONE tiny street in town! We finally got to the campground and approached a sign that told us that the campground closes at 4pm on Sundays and that NO late entries would be tolerated. Closed. Closed...I wanted to cry. I almost did. What would we do? We didn't want to backtrack to the Doyle? We didn't really want to stay at the Doyle anyway. Have a hotel pick us up and stay there? We weren't planning on spending $55; we were planning on spending $5-$10!! Verge was holding up very well, but I just...I'd had such a bad day! I wanted to bail! $55 was worth it to me at that moment. Verge tried to make me see reason and tell me it probably wasn't what I wanted because the next camping area with water is only three miles away (up a two mile hill after not having filled up water for over 7 miles...) and asked me are you ""physically capable"" of going further? That really got to me. Yes, I'm ""physically capable"" but I was mentally drained and so hangry. I felt like I was being weak-willed or something because here's my sister with Lyme disease wondering why I'm not up for going further. Physically capable? Bah. That made me mad. However, it also made me realize that the trail experience is largely about growing stronger in more ways than one, including a stronger will. She was right. I felt physically capable, so why don't I just grit my teeth and get up that damn hill and get some water when I get there? Alright. I marched up that hill and along the way even was enjoying the climb. The breeze picked up, the sun was setting over the Susquehanna River, the air smelled beautiful, and my dad called me. We got to camp, got water, set up the tent, ate dinner, bearbagged, and met a couple guys out for the weekend from the air national guard. They shared chocolate pudding with us, and all was right in the world. I'm so thankful for my incredibly strong sister who is helping me build a stronger will. Just keep smiling.","Scott Farm ATC HQ

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539265,"Happy Summer!!!Verge and I were both very tired, so we got a late start. Great P came down and said hello which was a nice addition to my morning.Suitably so, it was an INCREDIBLY HOT first day of summer! We got to a shelter for a break and for water but the water was down a very very steep set of stone steps two tenths of a mile straight down (and therefore straight up...) By the time I got back up it had taken 20 minutes, 1,100 steps, and about two gallons of sweat. EW.I met Even Keel at the shelter and ran into Morning Bear again. I'd been hiking by myself the second half of the day, but I waited for Verge and she was right behind me. She was going to stop to get water, so I continued on. Shortly thereafter, I saw my first rattlesnake!! It didn't even rattle--I was so scared. I was worried about Verge walking by because I heard the second or third person to walk by is usually the one who gets bit, so I waited for her. She took longer than I thought (she didn't know I was waiting) so I was basically just hanging out with a rattlesnake (I was a safe distance away but stil able to see it). It was NOT fun. She finally came and when she walked by it rattled so loudly! Freaky.We made the final push up the big hill and it was not fun. We put on some music to help motivate us. We passed a tentsite of people and got to see two porcupines! Cute! Verge and I got to the tentsite we'd been aiming for and saw our buddies, Jingle, Great P, and Training Wheels! We ended our night with having dinner with them (and the bugs made dinner out of us). We also apparently were tenting near a quarry so there was deep booming noises (""rattling"") and yellow-tinted water. Cool!The solstice is always a magical time for Verge and me, so this year our solstice miracles were surviving the heat, bugs, snakes, lack of water, more heat, more bugs, finding raspberries, porcupines, and friends.

What's also crazy is that I've probably hiked more in the south now than in all my years and miles of hiking in the north! (Not for long though!)We got an earlier start this morning, and it seemed like it'd be a cooler, lovelier day! We ran into Jingle, Great P, and Wheels and hiked on and off with them all day. Then we ran into TRAIL MAGIC!!! Dirty Ernie is 68 years old, thru-hiked in 2007, and plans to hike it again next year for his tenth anniversary! He is very cool and his wife is so sweet. She likes to join him on his hikes (but for shorter periods of time). They had a whole tent set up with cookies, granola bars, bbq sandwiches, grapes, apples, and soda! It was delightful! Another trail angel, Doc, joined and added cold bottles of water, ice, blueberries, and cherries! Wow! Fruit and cookies?! My favorite!!!We finally got up after lots of chatting and enjoyed the nice terrain (and a second trail magic of a cooler of soda!). It dod start to get a little rocky and unmaintained, but Verge and I had a nice time. We got to the William Penn Shelter, which was our plan...but we heard the 501 shelter was really great and had a shower and possibly pizza...it was only four more miles...and we'd gotten an earlier start so it was only 5:30pm! 25 mile day here we go??It was SO worth it! We got there and even though a couple things were starting to hurt (left shin, right knee, hip flexors) we made it! We saw Chicken Feet, El Tejano, Waterfall, Conundrum, Aurora, and a couple others. El Tejano and Chicken Feet insisted we take their leftover pizza (they didn't have to insist too hard!) Pizza?? And Showers?? And Hobo laundry?? How lucky can a girl get in one day?! Heeler (Don) showed up a little bit after us as well. What a nice group. I love Chicken Feet. He's the sweetest. He was so happy to see that Verge was feeling better because he'd been worrying about her. Speaking of which, Verge is feeling WAY better! Officially on the mend. Either it was a flu that she's getting over, or it was Lyme disease and the doxycycline is doing what it's supposed to. I'm so happy things are all working out.

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539272,"Today was fantastic.It was sunny and breezy and relatively cool. Verge and I hiked together all day, and though we didn't talk much at all, it was very pleasant and relaxing. We took a long break by a spring for lunch and figured out a tentative plan to meet my friend Kate who lives just outside of Philly! I'm so excited to see her; I can't wait! One plan has us seeing her on Monday, but she has exams Tuesday and Wednesday, so we may have to relocate and reschedule for Wednesday/Thursday. So excited!We hiked to the Eagle's Nest Shelter where we got water. Originally, we had planned to stay here because we thought the terrain was going to be strenuous and rocky, but it wasn't that bad so we kept walking! I was just about done because I was painfully hungry, so Verge shared a snack so that we could keep going. I'm all good as long as I'm fed! It's actually really hilarious to see the difference in what our bodies need calorie-wise. I need just about twice as much food as she does, and I'm STILL always hungry, whereas she eats much less and is rarely hungry. Oh metabolism, how I love you so, but seriously?? Silliness.We finally got to the tentsite, got ""chores"" done, and happily ate our dinner. Only three miles in the morning to Port Clinton!

Verge and I knew the post office didn't open until 12:30pm, so we decided to sleep in and take our time getting to town! We didn't arrive in Port Clinton until around 11am, so we took a walk looking for water and came upon a house that had a sign for thru-hikers offering their hose to fill water! Score! While we were filling up, a lady walks over and talks to us about our hike. As she was leaving, I asked if she knew a nice place in town to have lunch; she mentioned ""3C's"" down the street has great breakfast served all day, and she offered to drive us! Wow! Good first impression Port Clinton and much thanks to trail Angels! We had a lovely meal at 3C's (I had a veggie omelette with jam and toast, and Verge had an own faced tuna melt. We had a big fruit bowl and vanilla ice cream for dessert! Mmmmmm!)We finally got to the post office (it was definitely open by now), and someone runs up from behind me and startles me! It's Sweets! She caught up after she was sick the other day! She cranked out multiple over 20 mile days to get back to us (Jingle, Wheels, Great P, Mountaingoat, and Princess Peach and his puppy Scoober were all there too!) The barber shop was really groovy (and had free cookies) and the candy shop down the street was overwhelmingly awesome (but had a grumpy lady running the counter...)We finally left town at around 3pm with weak intentions of going all the way to Eckville Shelter (15 more miles), but Mountain Goat texted me that he and his buddies were doing trail magic just up the trail and to come join! We debated passing them because we really wanted to get some miles in, but we decided if we only stayed until 6:30pm (we would get to the spot at 5:45pm) and made sure we hiked 7 more miles, then we could go. When we got there, however, all our buddies were there! Jingle, Wheels, Mountain Goat, Princess Peach, Great P, Sweets, Chicken Feet; even Tumbleweed and Shiv surprised us by showing up in a rental car to say goodbye before they took a three week hiatus to Germany!! It was such a great time, I couldn't bear to go when 6:30 rolled around! Verge kept giving me the ""it's time to go, you promised"" look, and finally just passed 7pm, we left. Most of our buddies were only planning on going four more miles to this spot called ""the pinnacle"" where there's an amazing spot to see the sunrise, but Verge was still set on pushing 7 more miles. After we left, she let me have it. We had a huge fight about how I went back on my word and how we have different goals for the trip and it just isn't going to work out if we aren't on the same team, etc. It was awful. I've never angry-hiked so quickly before in my life. I got four miles in and it was dark and rocky, so I decided I'd wait for her to see if she wanted to camp there or continue in the rocky darkness. She agreed to stop here, and it turned out to be the pinnacle and our buddies were not too far behind. Princess Peach is from the area and has hiked the pinnacle many times, so he suggested exactly where to go and that we should ""cowboy camp"" (sleep with your sleeping pad/sleeping bag on the ground or rock under the stars with no tent). I decided, it's a perfect, windy, chilly night with a bright moon ,and I've never done it before, and there's no chance of rain,so why not?! (Rattlesnakes--that's why not--but don't worry, they never came out).Verge slept in our tent, but I enjoyed my night of ""cowboy camping."" The weather was perfect. I slept wonderfully.

Lean your trekking poles against a tree? Careful! Walk through brush to hang a bearbag? Careful!The ticks--everyone is pulling a few off a week. Verge had Lyme disease! I've heard of others having to get off the trail for a bit because of it!The heat--so much sweat. I didn't know I could sweat this much. I didn't know it could be possible to have every inch of your body be dripping. The heat (like I've mentioned) made me lose my appetite, made me nauseous, and made me feel faint. The bugs--they constantly (no matter the weather) swarm your face--especially your eyes--and make it so that you can't see. When you're eating, they just attack your body. I found six in my bra after one minute. Six! I killed nine one day just from blinking them out of my eyes! The lack of water--ten mile stretches of hot rock-walking with nowhere to refill water. If you accidentally pass one water source...backtrack because the next one probably isn't for at least another six miles.The lack of trail maintenance--sorry if this one is harsh, but it looks like no one wants to go near the trails in Pennsylvania to maintain them. I don't blame them. The ferns are nice but totally grown into the trail, the prickers on bushes are out to get me. I look like I've been attacked by a cat. Or multiple cats. The blazes are not clearly marked and many times it's difficult to see which way the trail goes.The rattlesnakes--I hate snakes. There are so many. I hate snakes. I saw two in one spot just today (a little Boy Scout claimed he saw eight in that same spot...)The rocks--I mean, it's nicknamed ""Rocksylvania"" for a reason. They weren't kidding. I love rock-hopping and all, but some of these stretches are just so hard on the body. My shoes are...obliterated (pictured above). Don't worry I'm working on getting new ones...but man, my feet hurt. They're so tired and sore.The mindset--you'd think that when people reached the halfway point that spirits would be soaring? Think again. It seems the majority of people's spirits have plummeted! I'm so excited to be in a new state...and further north...and over halfway...but each 100 miles isn't as exciting anymore...and most people wanted to be done with Pennsylvania a couple miles after entering it. Even some of my most positive friends are getting mentally worn down. Pennsylvania took the Appalachian trials to a whole new level. It hit, and it hit hard. Here I am, my sister and I had a huge, possibly trail-altering fight, my dad hurt his knee and is worried about finishing, some of my friends are depressed about the trail and some have even dropped out from injuries, I need to deal with getting new shoes from Salewa, the grace period on my student loans is officially up in less than one month and they won't realize that they need to re-defer until I'm actually back at school in the fall, I haven't completely finished enrolling in all the classes I need to, and I need to actually keep up high mileage to even finish in time for school. Pennsylvania...why ya gotta be so stressful?On a happier note (finally), Verge and I did talk today and have worked things out, we'll have a rest day in Delaware Water Gap in a couple days, less than 50 miles left of Pennsylvania, and I get to see my buddy Kate soon! I'm so excited! (Oh and we got amazing trail magic today just before the shelter after hiking 22 miles. Then some guys came and added their trail magic to the original trail magic!

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539706,"So, at the beginning of the day I was thinking maybe I was too harsh on Pennsylvania. It presented delicious sweet little blueberries for us all over the trail and the ferns and sunlight were giving me beautiful scenery to admire. It seemed like it was trying to apologize! However, then we entered no water zone. We filled up and hydrated at a shelter 7 miles into the day where we saw Deuces, Scooter, and met Scarfoot, and I began to be filled with dread. There would be no water for the next 10 miles and we were going to be exposed in the extreme heat on supposedly one of the hardest, rockiest climbs we've ever encountered on the trail: the climb out of Lehigh Gap. The climb was actually pretty fun for me; there was a TON of maneuvering up and over humongous boulders, but it was very tiresome and the heat was sweltering. (Pictured above: Lehigh Gap and Scooter is in the background taking pictures with his awesome camera.) After we got to the top, we found some blackberries, which distracted us for about an hour! There were SO many. We were careful of how many we took though, but every time we took a couple and moved on, there was another huge bush of them! Yum! Though berry distractions all day were fun, it stopped us up quite a bit, and we still had 7 miles to do at 5pm. Verge and I were both so spent. Dehydrated, tired, bruised, scratched, bug bitten, disgustingly sweaty and dirty, sunburnt, and, in my case, nauseous from the heat, we tried our best to eek a few more miles out. Verge giggled, and she said, ""I'm kind of so miserable that it's funny.""I realized that's just the theme of Pennsylvania--so miserable that it's funny.The cherry on top of the day: we got to our campsite and knew we had to go 0.4 miles down a steep hill for water, but two locals camping said, ""hey are you all set with water? That spring is completely dry; you'd have to go a mile downhill to the next spring."" Really PA? We thankfully had a half a liter left, so I told Verge I'd eat dry ramen and she could use it to cook her dinner and we'd use just a teensy bit for oatmeal in the morning. One of the guys there, Joker, had gone down for water and apparently it was 1.5 miles downhill so he had made a 3 mile round trip for water! Oh man! He came back with 4 liters and offered to share (so we gave him a candy bar in exchange for a little bit). The next reliable water source isn't for another six miles tomorrow, so we were very appreciative.Though I'm complaining a lot about Pennsylvania, I promise I'm still trying my best to keep a positive outlook. I'm loving the berries and ferns. Jingle and Sweets make me happy. I can't wait for our near-o into Delaware Water Gap.

It was a long, steep climb down to the spring, but we drank two liters each and stocked up for the next 14 miles of no water on trail. I even got to have a mini dance party while waiting for Aqua mira to purify my water.The day got hotter; the terrain got harder; we saw a gigantic rattlesnake; poison ivy has taken over the trail, and the bugs were relentless. Verge and I tried to stay positive and talk about the wonderful things about summer that we get to experience out here: lots of fragrant, beautiful ferns, vitamin D, butterflies, flowers, all the wondrous green, good, cold water, warm, breezy air, etc. It was a helpful positivity exercise. We got to a point where we had about 9 miles left, and we were running low on motivation, though we were doing better than yesterday. We tried chatting about our plans as we get closer to Massachusetts and the friends we'll get to see; we tried some singing; we talked about what we were grateful for, and we enjoyed talking about what things we'll do on our wonderful near-o tomorrow (that was exciting). Unfortunately, with only 5 miles left, my spirits plummeted. I didn't get the Virginia blues, but I have the Pennsylvania blues hardcore. I'm hoping this near-o tomorrow is just what I need to wash away all the things making me sad (along with a LOT of sunscreen, bug spray, dirt, sweat, other grime, etc.) Also, I feel the need to mention (because it's part of my trail experience) that I'm doctoring a bit of a sore heart. I'd like to keep it succinct, though. I had a crush on trail, turns out he had a crush on me too, the romance developed slowly and sweetly, and then came to a screeching halt, and hopefully, is just on pause, though it's up in the air and a bit confusing. Que sera, sera. However, it too is adding to the Pennsylvania blues.Thankfully, Verge and I got to the shelter (and had it all to ourselves), got water from the easy spigot in the back, and enjoyed our Dirty Rice Knorr Pasta Side. I needed that so badly. It immediately made me feel better. I was still so hungry I made another dinner! (First time I've ever done that on trail.) Verge split her last cocoa with me too. Dad called, which was nice. We're closing in! Less than 100 miles between us now! (But we're about to near-o and then a couple days zero with my friend Kate so we'll see what that does.)

Heck yes, ice cream on a beautiful, sunny day!...it was closed. They're only open Thurs.-Sun. Dang! So then we were heading towards the post office and ran into Mr. Blue! We hadn't seen him in a while! Unfortunately, he's injured and taking some time off the trail. He said he might even turn it into a flip flop! Maybe we'll see him the other direction. On our way to the post office, we passed Zen Fusion, the Haitian place my dad had raved about and that we'd been dreaming of going to all week...it's only open Fri.-Sun.!! What's with this town?! Of course we had to be there on a Monday! We got to the post office, got our drop box, walked to the church hostel, and claimed a bunk. At the church, we saw Jelly who was debating zeroing! We also ran into Joker, Olive Oil, Treebeard, and Waterfall. Multiple people told us about the amazing bakery down town so we just HAD to go! Jelly accompanied Verge, Olive Oil, and me to the bakery and we saw Treebeard and Waterfall there too. We all ordered delicious lunches and desserts. (I ordered an amazing burrata salad with avocado and cucumbers and tomatoes and a balsamic drizzle and Verge ordered a goat cheese and berry salad with walnuts and a honey drizzle and we shared. Mmmmmmmm! We then each got a slice of apple pie and a scoop of ice cream--amazing!!) Jelly decided he wouldn't zero because he didn't want Jingle and Sweets to catch him; goofball!

We stopped at the town outfitter on our way back and we got the couple things we needed (aqua Mira and gas) and I finally got new shoes!! Salewa was very helpful in the warranty process; I called and told them how quickly my shoes got ripped up and they said I just had to send my old shoes to them and they'd send me a new pair.

Craziness.This morning I woke up and realized there were still quite a few things I needed to get done that I didn't get done because my buddies came and distracted me! (A welcome distraction, I must say.) Yesterday, I did laundry, showered, got our drop box, bought new shoes, Aqua Mira, and gas, and finalized plans with Kate; however, I needed a couple things from Walmart (TP/new water bottles/town dress/etc.) and I needed to find a printer! We got a shuttle to Walmart from a guy named Kenny, and he also brought Morning bear and me to the library after, as well. He said we needed to find our own way back via the yellow bus line though.I printed what I needed (warranty form for Salewa and a course override form for my school) and we had to chase down the bus because we missed by two minutes! Luckily, he let us on and we were back to the hostel in no time. I quickly finished my post office chores (the ladies there were very helpful and friendly), and then I left to catch up with Verge, who had left an hour earlier but ended up waiting for me anyway at the Kittatinny Visitor center where we had lunch together before moseying on. It was such a weight off my shoulders to finally get new shoes, send back the old ones, and sort everything out with Salewa. It was another huge weight off my shoulders to send the course override form because I really need to take that specific class next semester but it's listed as full online! The trail and its challenges are constantly evolving. In the beginning, it was learning new skills, adapting to trail life, and getting into hiking shape. It then morphed into finding a balance between the social aspects of the trail and your mileage goals you set for yourself. It has also become a major mental struggle with positivity and endurance. My current challenges are how some of my stresses from ""the real world"" are seeping into my magical wilderness world, such as classes approaching, loan deadlines, finishing in time for school, etc., and also a struggle with wanting to hike your own hike while having to compromise with someone else who also wants to hike their own hike (aka sister struggles.) It has been a very real question as to whether we are going to separate. It seems crazy after all this time, but we want to experience things differently, which makes sense because we're different people! I think it's important for us to learn and grow individually on this journey; however, after a few pretty heated discussions, we've decided it makes most sense to stick it out together. If not because it's financially smart to do so, then because we're best friends and love each other, and if not for that, then because it is very important to learn how to compromise and work together with someone through thick and thin. I know I've already grown through this experience with Verge, and I know there's more to learn and more to practice.Also--we're officially in New Jersey! Hallelujah! From just a small day of hiking, I can already see and feel the difference. Yes, there are still rocks, but it's different! I actually saw a view! And felt the wondrous wind on my skin on the top of an open hill covered in tall grass. It was amazing; I felt so comforted. I'm sad to be missing the awesome pool party Mountain Goat invited us to, but tomorrow my best friend Kate is picking us up from Culver Gap (Branchville, NJ) and taking us to her home in Swarthnore, PA to have a nice, relaxing zero day! First real zero day since Daleville! SOOO excited!!! (I'm going to ignore the fact that I'll be back in PA...it doesn't count if it's not on the trail, right?)

After our oatmeal, we packed up our wet tent and got going. We need to try to hike quickly today because we're meeting my amazing friend Kate at 4:00pm, and we have 16.5 miles to hike and we were getting started at 9:30!We hiked for about 45 minutes before we ran into trail magic!! These three wonderful ladies who were part of the Hunterdon Hiking Club had set up a ""Munch N Go"" table full of delicious blueberries, bananas, oranges, cookies, brownies, hard boiled eggs, etc. We just had to stop! We chatted and munched and realized that just about 45 minutes passed! Uh-oh! Time to get going!So far, New Jersey is wonderful. Verge and I have been immensely enjoying the terrain, the weather, the people, the trail magic, etc. The environment around us is definitely starting to remind us more of home! The pine needles, rocks, breeze, and small views remind us of some parts of the mid-state trail in Massachusetts. It's terrific! Along the way, we ran into Joker and Dreamin! They were doing four days southbound because Dreamin lives nearby. We continued and also saw Chicken Feet! We couldn't chat too long because by now we basically had to run to try to meet Kate in time! We were only about two miles away now, and I was chatting with Verge and looked up and saw a huge mama bear and her cub right near the trail, staring at me. It was so cool! (And a little frightening.) I gave Kate a call to make sure she could find where we were meeting, and it all worked out perfectly with all the perfect timing! We got down the hill, and there she was waiting for us with chips and cookies! Amazing! I was so happy to see her beautiful face! We chatted and munched, and soon after, Chicken Feet emerged from the woods and we did a little trail magic of our own and gave him some cookies. We rode the 2 and a half hours to Swarthmore, PA, visited with her family, ate some pizza, and got ready to go out and meet her friends! It was really a special treat to be able to try on clothes and play with makeup. Kate and I got all dolled up and went out to meet her boyfriend and friends while Verge stayed at Kate's house, relaxing and watching Tarzan. Great day.","Kittatinny Ridge Tentsite

They were the fluffiest, best pancakes ever! We relaxed, decided to go to a strip mall nearby, window shopped, had a quick snack lunch, and made our way back to the house for the evening's fun events. Kate's sister, Liz, had baked me a cake for a belated 21st birthday party! We had swordfish, whole wheat pasta, salad, cucumbers, and it was so delicious! After dinner, we all went to ""Xscape the Room: Safehouse,"" which is this neat new game where you get a group of people together and go to this place where they give you a mission/objective and lock you in a room full of clues for you to try to ""escape the room."" We had a mission impossible themed game, and it was so incredibly fun! It was high energy, interactive, and mind-boggling. They give you one hour, and our terrific crew got out in 40 minutes! The sense of accomplishment you feel afterwards is really terrific. What a wonderful idea.After going out and hanging out with Kate's friends for a bit, we came home early so that we could get enough sleep for getting back to the trail in the morning. Delightful day.

I love you!!! We didn't get started on trail again until 1pm, and we were going to try to go 16 miles to high point shelter.Jersey was still treating us very well; we were even enjoying the pre-storm weather (severe storm weather warnings). It was breezy and relaxing and cool. Verge and I had a little bit of a rough time because it's sometimes much harder to get going later in the day, though that seems to happen to us a lot. Then came the rain. It POURED on us. The trail turned into a river; my shoes turned into sponges; it was incredible! I really don't mind getting poured on. In fact, I think I really needed that. I felt like the rain just washed everything negative away. I sloshed through the trail with a huge smile on my face.The sun came out and dried us out a little, and we got to high point state park where the headquarters gave us free soda and we met Funsize and Pie. Unfortunately, my stomach started hurting a ton and I felt like I barely made it to the shelter, but the beautiful sunset from the highest point in New Jersey certainly alleviated my pain a little bit. We didn't expect there to be room in the shelter after all the storming, but it was empty! We were soon joined by Optimistic Dreamer, Baby Chicken, and Gung Ho.

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540690,"I love the AT in New Jersey! I woke up to the beautiful sunlight (and to some less than considerate people blowing cigarette smoke in my direction), but the weather was absolutely perfect. The rain really cooled everything off and gave it all new life. Verge and I had our oatmeal and headed out. Just a few miles in, we made it to the ""Secret Shelter"" or the ""Jim Murray Shelter,"" which is a non-official shelter where this guy (Jim Murray) has a cabin and well water that he lets AT hikers use. It was so beautiful and relaxing that we snacked and laid in the grass in the sunshine for over an hour. We never saw the famous donkeys that are known for freely wandering around the property, but we saw a whole little family of turkeys! So cute!We grudgingly continued on (we could have stayed for hours!) and leapfrogged a bit with a couple hikers named Blanco and Kactus as well as a couple of guys leading an older Boy Scout troop. The terrain treated us so well; there were rolling hills and miles of fields, and the breeze had my spirits soaring.We did some unexpected road walking and ran into El Tejano's wife Yvonne doing trail magic! It was a delicious little treat (and we ran into El Tejano himself as well), but soon after, my stomach started bothering me again and it was very slow going for the next couple miles, though it was gorgeous scenery near a wildlife park. New Jersey saved me again with easy board-walking (sections of boards laid over mud to make it easier to walk) and more trail magic! I was feeling my worst when we came upon a cooler full of carrots, cherries, and cookies! I couldn't have asked for anything more perfect! Thank you Trail Angels! We walked a little further and were worried about where we'd get our next water when we saw that someone had left a huge gallon jug of water for people to fill up with. My goodness! So much luck (and great helpful people!) Sadly, because of my day off with Kate, we are just about half a day behind our friends Jingle, Sweets, Wheels, Great P, and Mountain Goat. Sweets was texting me asking where we'd be that night, and when I told her we were aiming for Vernon, she sent me the name and number of a trail angel she had just met in a grocery store who she thought would love to help us out with a ride to the church hostel in town. Awesome!We contacted Trail Angel Dori and she told us it'd be no problem to pick us up (even though we wouldn't be there until 7:30ish)! She even told us she would love to have us stay at her house with her and tell her all about the trail instead of having to go to the hostel. Wow! I'm amazed at how perfectly that worked out. We busted our butts to get there in a good amount of time, and thankfully, we hit the famous 2.5 miles of flat, beautiful boardwalk on the trail where we ran into a friendly gentleman named Michael, who helped us pass the time with comfortable chit chat. He walked us right to the pastures full of cows before the highway, and we parted ways. Time to meet Dori! Dori picked us up at Heaven Hills Farm and drove us to her sweet log cabin in the Highland Lakes area in Vernon. She made us right at home with setting up a futon with sheets, sharing pajama shirts for us to wear while we had showers and did laundry, giving us TONS of delicious fresh fruit (pineapple, blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, grapes, apples), and watching Wimbledon on her tv. So relaxing and fun! Thank you Dori! (and thank you Sweets!) (and thank you New Jersey!)","High Point Shelter

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540696,"Verge and I woke up well rested and ready to hike. Dori had the table set and breakfast ready to go! She cooked us some tasty eggs mixed with cilantro and onions, and we also polished off the fruit and had some toast and hummus. Yum! We also got to set some peanuts out on her deck and watch as the bluejays came and flew down to eat them. Dori was more than happy to drive us to the trail, but she presented us with a couple other options as well. She told us how she plays pickle ball and would love to teach us how to play, and she also showed us her kayaks and how close the lake was to her house in case we wanted to kayak or go swimming. Who can turn down hanging out with the sweetest lady ever while learning new things (pickle ball) and doing what we love (kayaking and swimming)? We had to consider that we had already had our ""near-o"" day in Delaware Water Gap on Monday shortly thereafter followed by an actual zero day with my friend Kate on Thursday, and here we are debating another diversion from the trail today (Sunday), but as Dori said, ""when opportunity knocks..."" Looks like we're hanging out with Dori today!Pickle ball was SO fun! It was fairly easy to catch on to because Verge and I have both played tennis before. I can't wait to tell our grandparents that we know how to play and can now challenge them in a match! (They'd probably kick our butts.) Since Dori was sensitive to our time goals (our hope was to have fun but still get back to the trail today), we didnt stay for too long so that we could go back to her house and start getting the kayaks ready! We unloaded and rinsed them off and put new stickers on them, and then we brought them down the hill to the dock where we (mostly) gacefully maneuvered into them and paddled around the lake. We saw lots of fish, turtles, ducks, and swimmers. We hopped in the refreshing water after as well! It was bliss. Dori talked about how you have some moments in life where everything is perfect and you have nothing to worry about because you're so happy; this was definitely one of those moments. We went inside and Dori made us a delicious grilled cheese with cilantro, hummus, radishes, and a pretty purple cabbage salad on the side. We devoured it all! The next few hours we relaxed and Dori gave us everything she could think of! (Toilet paper, snacks galore, new trash bag liners, even a pair of sneakers that didn't fit her because Verge's are falling apart!) I can't believe how generous she was! Though we continuously thanked her for everything, she was constantly reiterating that she was as thankful for us as we were for her. For the finale of our perfect adventure, we went out for ice cream at Heaven Hills Farm and walked around looking at flowers. Dori dropped us off at the trail and we said our goodbyes. Goodbye Fairy Godmother! This was truly magical. (We'll see her again, I'm sure.)We hiked the ""Stairway to Heaven"" though I'm pretty sure we were leaving heaven behind, and we ran into Bougie and Sailor Jerry a couple times on our way to the Wawayanda shelter. By the time we had got going it was past 5pm, so there was a pretty slim chance of us getting very far. Perhaps it's best to just accept the near-o day, get a good night of sleep, and have a good long day tomorrow. As we were sitting in our tent, I could hear all the buzzing from the mosquitos that had been devouring me outside, along with some fireworks that must have been going off in town. I've never heard mosquitos that loudly. Ramen and a couple cookies for dinner, and I'm ready for bed! I am so incredibly thankful for all the magic New Jersey has brought me, and I'm very excited for what New York will bring.

I am so very thankful for the freedom in the U.S. as well as the freedom I get to experience out here.So today was very hot with a blue sky, lots of rocks, and lots of people! Being Fourth of July, it was quite crowded. Verge and I don't do very well in the heat, so naturally when we saw there was a place to get ice cream right off the trail halfway through our day, we thought it was the perfect Fourth of July treat! We found the place, Bellvale Creamery, and it was SO crowded! We got in line, and a nice couple in front of us informed us that we'd stumbled upon one of the best creameries in America (so said USA today)! Wow! How fun! I got a large Meadow Muffin, which was dark chocolate ice cream with brownie bits and gobs of peanut butter. It was SO GOOD! Verge and I relaxed outside and ate our ice cream and decided we definitely needed more...so I got up and got another large (which we split) and this time we got In the Stix (French vanilla and twix pieces) and a banana. After relaxing and eating some more, we decided it would just be too funny if we went up again!! Plus, who cares?! It's our Fourth of July treat! So, I went up a third time, giggling, expecting to be judged for the obscene amounts of ice cream I've been ordering, and I realized we'd been there so long that the staff switched over! Too funny! This time we split a small of half white chocolate ice cream with a raspberry swirl and dark chocolate pieces and just plain chocolate chip cookie dough. DELICIOUS! (Oh and another banana because ya gotta be nutritious...)Finally, it was time to get moving again. We sluggishly got up and dragged out feet back to the trail, where we still had to do 8 or so more miles, and it was 4pm. It was very hot, and there weren't many water sources ahead of us, but thankfully, the trail Angels of New York know what you need! We ran into a dozen or so gallon jugs of water there for us to fill up with. Hurray! We hiked on to a random tentsite, got devoured by bugs while setting up the tent and bearbagging, and fell asleep to the sound of fireworks followed by rain. I was sad we couldn't make it to party with our trail buddies, who were a day or so ahead of us at Bear Mountain, but chilling and eating ice cream for a couple hours with my sister was a pretty darn good way to spend my Fourth of July.","Wawayanda Shelter

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541229,"The other day, my mom told me to get in touch with our family friend, Marla who lives in New York, because she said she would love to host us, so I called her up and we set up a plan for her to meet us at Bear Mountain today at 6pm; however, that means we would have to hike 21 miles, so we got up early (6:45...) and got going! (Unfortunately, it had rained all night and was raining on us in the morning, so we took a while to pack up the wet tent and we didn't end up leaving until 8am.) Now we had 10 hours to hike 21 miles...should be doable. EXCEPT for the fact that it was quite difficult terrain (thanks New York) and all the rocks, of which there were PLENTY, were slick with rain. We ran into Sacagewea for the first time in a while, which was nice, but as the day progressed, it got hotter and hotter. We checked our clock to see that we'd only gone four miles in three hours. WHAT?! How?! Crap! Time to reevaluate our plan! (Especially because the terrain in the book only looked like it got harder.) We called and changed the plan to have Marla pick us up at the Palisades Parkway Visitor Center at 6pm, which would only be 16 miles for the day but seemed more doable. Now we had 7 hours to go 12 more miles.EXCEPT it got SO hot. Have you ever gone swimming, against the current, with a thirty pound pack on, and weights strapped to your ankles? Well, nor have I, but I'm pretty sure it was comparable to how I felt hiking today. It was dreadful. Verge and I decided this definitely made the list for one of the hardest days ever. This obviously then lead to a conversation of which days were our hardest ever, which then lead to a conversation of which days were our best ever, which of course then lead to which have been our favorite meals ever (because it always comes back to talking about food).Then we got to the Lemon Squeezer, and let me tell you, it was quite the squeeze. Verge and I struggled through the tight rocks slicked with rain and dirt, and Verge even started yelling at it, which made us laugh. Then, as if that wasn't enough, we came to a very difficult rock structure you'd to climb up and over. We had to throw our packs and poles up first, then climb around a wet tree and push off of a wet rock--not fun! Also comical! We had fun throwing a couple fits (especially Verge). There were two cute little baby deer in our path (still had spots and everything) and Verge started yelling at them! ""Go away! No one likes you, baby deer! Go! Shoo!"" It was so funny! What made it even better was that they didn't even care! Here's this wacko shouting and growling at them and they didn't even run away (no sign of momma). It was hilarious. Finally, the sun was out and everything looked beautiful and green. It was really quite magical--but still too hot! Mid 90s and SO humid! Thankfully, we got to the visitor center with time to spare. Sadly, it had closed at 5pm so we couldn't make use of the vending machines or bathrooms. So, we waited outside and aired out our tent while waiting for Marla. She arrived with cherries and nectarines for us! Yum! The ride to her apartment took about an hour, and she lives in the Bronx, so she's right in the city! So cool! It was very beautiful and much greener than I would have thought! She helped us with laundry; we got to shower, we ordered the most amazing Italian take out, and we even got to watch Indiana Jones while eating Tartufo (ice cream covered in chocolate with a cherry in the center--so much yum)! It was so fun chatting with her and getting to unwind from our goofy/ridiculously difficult day. Thank you so much Marla!!","Random Tentsite

We originally thought it was only 5 miles to the post office, which is only open 9-11am, and found out we actually had 7 miles to go and we were starting at 8:30am. We hiked as FAST as we could and it was brutal! I'd heard on the news that morning that New York is in a dangerous heat wave; temperatures in the 90s and humidity through the roof! ""Get your exercise in early,"" they said, and "" Stay hydrated and stay inside!"" Well, how about I hike as fast as I can up and down mountains for a couple hours? When we realized we weren't going to make it (or maybe would have barely made it but it would have sucked and we might have passed out after), I called the post office and asked if they could either stay open just a little longer or even just leave the package outside for us. The guy was very nice and understanding and said he'd leave it out for us! I was shocked and SO relieved. We hiked Bear Mountain, a popular hiking spot for local New Yorkers, and thankfully, that means pretty wide, well-groomed paths (and New York definitely has a thing for stairs). At the top, we saw Sacagewea and met Toiling Midget (who knows Bombadil!) After hiking down with Sacagewea, it was time to search for the post office. Again, it was a ridiculously hot and sunny day, so ice cream was also necessary. I found the post office, after much confusion and searching, ate a delicious vending machine ice cream, and went through our food while figuring out how many days until the next post office stop (Kent, CT). I've also discovered a love of skittles. We found out that our comfortable plan of getting us to Kent on Sunday wasn't going to work because the post office is closed there on Sunday, and worse, it's only open until 12:30pm on Saturday! We had to reevaluate our plan, which mostly meant make our days bigger so that we could try to get to Kent by Saturday by 12:30. Man, bad post office luck!We then continued on the trail through the Bear Mountain Park but didn't get very far because we were distracted by concession stands. We both got black bean burgers that were SO worth it because they were very scrumptious. We then walked through the Bear Mountain zoo (the trail goes right through it) and it was actually really sad. We saw all these animals that we see in the woods all the time (porcupines, foxes, bears) except they were tired, super hot, and caged up. It made me really sad. (Cute snapping turtle from the zoo pictured above.) Crossing Bear Mountain bridge in the sweltering heat was not very fun, and going up the half mile hill out of the lowest elevation on the trail want very fun either. We dos run into Pigeon Toe though and he's quite the storyteller.We got further and further and I got more and more tired, and just when I was starting to get grumpy, we emerged from the woods and saw an Appalachian Deli right by the trail! We, of course, HAD to investigate. We went in with just the idea of getting water and maybe some fruit, but we ended up getting dinner there (veggie salads, tuna salad, potato salad, and a pint of Ben and jerrys Phish Food). YES! Even though we spent a little extra money today, I thoroughly enjoyed every cent. We were soon joined by Sacagewea, Other Brother, and Pigeon Toe. Verge and I went just a couple miles further to keep up with our plan to get to Kent by Saturday afternoon, though it was difficult to pass up the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center, free tenting run by monks. Hiking was very happy with that delicious food in my belly. We found a beautiful ledge with a nice view and tented right nearby. Bugs have been awful lately. Ew! Goodnight!","The Bronx, New York City

Simmer down summer! We met Rainbow and Old Hiker on our first water break of the day. It seems we're in a weird off-bubble where we don't see many people at all and definitely don't see many people we know. It's weird! After our water break, Verge and I felt really light headed and a little nauseous and were a little worried about the effects of the heat. We continued on, however, and started to feel a little better. It helped even more when it rained! Then Old Hiker gave us his untouched bag of trail mix because he had too much weight in his pack and was trying to lighten up! At first, I was hesitant (we have a lot of food weight too), but then I saw how very different his trail mix is from ours--yogurt covered raisins, raisins, dark chocolate m&ms, honey roasted peanuts, chunks of dried pineapple, and most importantly, starburst jelly beans! I thought I didn't really care for jelly beans but oh man was I wrong! I love them! (Starburst ones). They're amazing and I want to eat them all! Mmmmm! (Our batch of trail mix was just almonds, plain peanuts, and some m&ms, so you can see why his was so enticing...thank you for the trail magic trail mix Old Hiker!)So it rained on us all day. Rain, rain, rain. It even picked up at one point and was ominously dark and thundery, and it began to downpour. Awesome! I love hiking in a downpour. There's something so therapeutic and relaxing about it. I couldn't stop smiling. The sun even poked out for a bit to attempt to dry us off (it didn't really work). We got to the RPH shelter and after a quick snack we continued on to try to make it to the Morgan something shelter.

My sleeping pad was soaked, which got my sleeping bag soaked when I slept on top of it, my shoes were soaked, my socks were soaked, my bag--soaked, and, of course, my clothes--soaked. As we packed up, we had to pick off DOZENS of slugs off the tent. Ew.Thankfully, none of this messed with my mood very much. I was happy. It was less hot and there was a slight breeze--improvements!On our first water break, we met Mr. Wizard and Salty and saw Scarfoot. Scarfoot and Mr. Wizard were just passing through, but we had a nice conversation with Salty while we downed the last of our trail magic trail mix. He's a very interesting and friendly fellow! It was nice chatting with him in the sunshine by the railroad tracks as we filled up on our suspect bog water. As Verge and I hiked on, we talked again about buddies we'll meet up with in Massachusetts and how excited we are for zeroing with our grandparents in NH. I think we're about 290 miles away from NH, which means we'll hopefully get there the last weekend in July! We'll see! So exciting! We also saw the biggest oak on the AT (Verge pictured above standing next to it.) Later, we were passing a road when we heard someone call to us; its Jingle, Sweets, and Wheels! Finally caught up to them! Yes! That was a fun surprise! We all hung out at this cool, hiker friendly ""native landscaping"" place (which had Klondike bars for sale mmmm). I'm an ice cream fiend these days! I actually even was almost on a five day streak! Pretty impressive for being on the trail! We were originally heading to the Ten Mile River Shelter, which would coincidentally be (just under) ten more miles, but Sweets suggested we have the post office move our box to the outfitter so that we wouldn't have a time constraint. Smart Sweets! She then, therefore, convinced us to just go to the Wiley shelter with them, which would only be 5.6 more miles. Okay you win Sweets!I enjoyed my mushroom flavored Knorr rice side (a little on the salty side) while chatting with Jingle, Sweets, Wheels, Salty, and this guy who just started the trail today! He was a riot! His pack weighed 65 lbs and he had at least 10 pairs of socks, 7 changes of clothes, and a blow torch! (Among many other things he will not need). It was so fun to see him on his first day and think back to my first day. I also met Dreamcatcher, Rambo, Honeybuns and saw Scarfoot again. Lovely night, a little mosquito-filled.

Verge and I hiked separately today. I put in my headphones and got going! It was so nice to listen to music; I hadn't in a while and definitely missed it. A mile or so into the day, I entered Connecticut! Heck yes it feels great to be in New England! It immediately filled me with a new excitement and a feeling of being home. I charged up the hills and flew down them with a huge smile! New England! Yay!I got to the Ten Mile River and was definitely a little sad we hadn't camped there because it was so beautiful! I couldn't resist dipping my feet and washing off some hiker grime.

We took what we wanted and needed and shared the rest with our buddies and any other hikers that came through (we met Geared Up who had done 36 miles today!) Verge and I then separated to go have our own late lunch/dinner at the Cheese Market, which turned out to be the BEST decision ever.We ordered their soup of the day (perfect for this wet, chilly day--some sort of warm carroty, creamy, deliciousness), a kale salad with brussel sprouts, beets, almonds, and a maple dressing, and a small French baguette with marinated grilled tomatoes, goat cheese, spinach, almonds, and a balsamic drizzle. OH. MY. GOD. BEST FOOD WE'VE EVER HAD. (Verge agrees.) Woah. Just...woah. Yum.How do you eat anything ever again after that? I know! Order an amazing hot fudge brownie sundae with three scoops of ice cream while watching the Sox game at AnnieBananies/the Kent Outfitter. I can't tell you how hard it was to leave after that. It was getting dark, and it was chilly and windy and drizzly. Perfect cuddle weather. All I wanted was to cuddle up and eat brownies and watch movies. Buuut, I had to hike 7 more miles to the next shelter. Gotta do it! We thankfully were offered a ride on our way back to the trail, so we started back on the trail at 6pm. We had difficult terrain for a couple miles, but thankfully, it flattened out for the end of our day. It was especially wonderful because it got pitch black and we were walking by a magnificent brook with our headlamps on and noticed all the amazing fireflies. Due to the flat terrain, we were able to turn our headlamps off and walk in the extreme darkness and watch all the magical twinkling of the fireflies. It was spectacularly peaceful and beautiful. We finally got to the shelter and had to quickly set up because it started to rain. Such a lovely day. So happy to be in New England. So happy to be on the trail. So happy to be so happy.","Wiley Shelter

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541681,"Verge and I had a bit of a grumpy morning with having to pack up the dirty, soaking wet tent and getting a late start. We were rubbing each other the wrong way and there was just a lot of negativity, so thankfully, we had a mini fight (which helped us up a steep mountain) and worked it out. We had a mixture of scattered showers and sunshine in the beautiful green forest, but it was still so humid and everything we own is wet and stinky. It seemed like overnight the terrain changed. All of a sudden we both could actually tell we were in New England. We know this land! It's familiar and wonderful and filled with pine needles, wet rocks, roots, and hills! Today was difficult, but we were both so blown away by the fact that we are really here. We're in New England! What's even weirder is that we'll be in Massachusetts tomorrow! We will have really done it: hiked from Georgia to home. Crazy. 700 or so more miles to go! People keep saying, ""you're almost there!"" But, even though there are only four states left, it will be the hardest terrain yet, and it's still 700 miles! When I think back to my first 700 miles, I remember how long it took! I still have a long way to go. Good thing too! I don't want this adventure to end!We were planning on hiking up the mountain to the next shelter, but I got a text from my friend Mountain Goat telling me about this cool place in Fall River (0.3 off trail) where we could tent behind this cafe! Sounds good to me! There's even an outdoor shower nearby! Verge and I made our way to the shower (and it was wide open so we just kept our clothes on and did a quick refreshing bronner's rinse--with a little pert for our hair--and BAM good as new) then made our way to town to find our buddies! There they all were in this cute backyard: Mountain Goat, Princess Peach, Wheels, Jingle, Sweets, Great P, even Chicken Feet! It was fun to regroup and hangout. It's so nice to have a little bubble to be in because I think back to a lot of people I've met and how far apart people can get. Verge and I were at Woods Hole Hostel near Pearisburg and met Endless and Terrible Lizard, both of whom we really liked, and now, Endless just finished the trail and Terrible Lizard is just getting out of Pennsylvania! Crazy to think about the difference. I feel very lucky to be in my bubble of wonderful people, though I do really miss people from earlier in my trip as well (Commando, Packrat, Lil Santa, Lucky, Wook, Beast, the Goon Squad, part of Quest, etc.) Anyway, in summary, I'm happy to be feeling so close to home. I can't wrap my head around the fact that I'll be in Massachusetts tomorrow. I love my friends. I'm forever hungry. Excited for better weather and less rain.

I got a great night of sleep and was ready for the day! We got going by 7:45am (maybe we'll actually get into camp before dark!)The second we get back on the trail we ran into trail magic! It was the remnants from the trail magic picnic we missed yesterday! Yay! I grabbed a couple granola bars, an apple, and some peanut butter to go packets. Score!I then hiked with Sweets for a while until we caught up with Jingle who was rock climbing. Neat! The weather was perfect today: 70, sunny, and windy. Thank you New England! I needed a break from all that rain and humidity! As we walked towards Salisbury, CT we did some road walking. Jingle and I were chatting and we saw Sweets cross the road and start running. We were confused until we saw that she was trying to get the road speedometer to pick up her speed! So funny! So, obviously, jingle and I went over and did the same thing! What a riot. Wheels caught up and we debated going into town for the bakery but found out it was closed. Too bad so sad--carry on!Soon after, we came upon the 1500 mile marker! Woah! I don't remember paying attention to the actual miles since like 500 miles ago! Funny how they just start flying by. The scenery was gorgeous today--rocks, roots, pines, open forest, views, babbling brooks covered in moss, etc. it was great! The terrain was pretty darn difficult, but I was on cloud nine. I got to hike with my buddies! I haven't in a while, so it was a nice change of pace. We stopped at a shelter for lunch, and it had a lovely picnic table with a view. We stayed longer than we meant to but got to book a room at a hotel we're splitting in Great Barrington tomorrow! Awesome. I also gave Sweets a back massage in exchange for the rest of her goldfish...I think I should make this a thing--food in exchange for back massages. Mmm pizza flavored goldfish.I then plugged in and listened to music to push me up some difficult hills (fun) and crossed the border into Massachusetts! Hallelujah! Unbelievable! Truly! Such an exciting milestone. Getting into New England really has given me the boost in morale that I'd been needing. I'm very grateful to have made it this far, and I am excited for what else the trail has in store.Verge and I met up and we ran into a girl named Lionheart. She was a hoot. It was fun to chat with her down Mt. Everett (the last tough climb of the day). I then ran into a buddy I needed to have a chat with, and although it cleared things up, it brought my mood down a bit. It was old news that I already knew but that hadn't been blatantly discussed. All water under the bridge now. We also found trail magic water though, which was great!Thankfully, Verge and I got to the shelter and Lionheart and some section hikers were there and we had dinner with them (around 7pm--earlier than the past few days at least). Lionheart is so funny! I loved hearing her talk about how much she hates mint. That picked my mood up a bit! It was further improved when I was about to blog and saw all the wonderful comments people had left in my guestbook. Being told ""you're a rockstar"" is one of the sweetest pick-me-ups I've gotten! Thanks Kezzybaum! It means so much to me when someone goes out of their way to encourage me on my adventure. Also, sad I missed Switchback who wanted to meet Verge and me! That would have been cool! Thank you all for your support, as always!A wonderful day overall. Definitely one of the better ones. I'm pretty darn proud of myself (and of Verge!)","Toy Maker Cafe Tentsite; Fall River, CT

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542289,"Verge and I took our time this morning; why not?! We only had 8 miles to do! Hurray for near-o-day!Everyone had already cleared out of camp, so we had a dance party as we packed everything up. It was super fun! On our way hiking to town, we got a splendid view of the town covered in thick clouds and the mountains in the background; it was so odd and beautiful. It seemed like the sun should but off all the clouds, but it wasn't. Very cool. People have definitely been right about mosquitoes in Massachusetts though. They are AWFUL! It's especially annoying because they're worst near water sources, but all the water sources are just mucky mud with no water, so we get all the bugs and no water. Bleh. You seriously can't even stop for a minute or they'll eat you. Thankfully, I ran away from them into the sunshine on a nice bug free bridge (over water we couldn't drink because of nearby farmlands), and I ran into a Southbound thru-hiker! His mms was Breezy; he was quite friendly. He even told us there was trail magic water a half mile ahead! Yes! At trail magic water, we ran into Scavenger, the Jingle, Sweets, and Wheels passed us, and then we met Slam. We'd heard so much about Slam it was fun to actually meet her. She is a 20 year old who is currently finishing her triple crown! Awesome! I also found out she's going to Hampshire College in the fall, which is in the five college group with UMass Amherst (where I go to school)! Super cool. We exchanged information, so maybe I'll meet up with her sometime in ""real life.""We finally got to the road where you get into Great Barrington. We were planning on hitching because it's a couple miles of road walking in the hot sun on pavement, but they were doing all sorts of road construction, which basically made hit him dangerously difficult. We decided to walk past it all and try our luck post-construction. It was more difficult than my first attempt hitching, but some very nice guy pulled over and drove us to the laundromat, which we had apparently almost walked all the way to. He was very sweet and wished he could help us more. Thank you, guy! We hung out, did laundry, had an amazing grocery store lunch (our favorite kind of lunch) of cheap sushi, a bag of mixed greens, a plum, and a peach. Mmmmm! I then ""yogied"" a ride from a lady at Big Y, and she drove us to the Days Inn down the street where we were splitting a room with Jingle, Wheels, and Sweets. After a refreshing shower, Verge and I hit the town! Dinner time! (The others went to do laundry and their resupply). We explored a little and ended up picking Thai food (we've never tried it). I got a spicy eggplant dish, and Verge got a veggie and peanut sauce dish, and we shared. SO amazing! Loved it. We then went to SoCo for dessert and got a huge delicious froyo. My tastebuds were in heaven. Have you ever had caramel froyo with raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, and warm cookie pieces, drowned in hot fudge and caramel sauce? Well you should. Wow. Just wow. We made our way back to the room, and we all hung out and watched Julia Roberts kill it in Pretty Woman while drinking some wine. Fantastic.","Hemlocks Shelter

We do, I guess. I shamelessly asked a nice lady and her daughter who were walking out of CVS if they were driving the direction of the trail and if they would give us a lift if it wasn't a hassle. The mom seemed hesitant, but the daughter was totally gung-ho, so they drove us! The daughter was so sweet and asked lots of questions, and I found out she might go to Umass next year! The mom started to warm up to us and relayed that she'd never driven strangers before, but by the end, you could tell she liked us and was glad she helped. Too cute!It was almost noon by the time we started hiking, and it was disgustingly hot. I sweat a lot. It's probably healthy, but it's darn gross. My stomach also wasn't feeling top notch because of the heat, the Thai, the wine, and gummy bears. Odd mixture. Not pleasant. You know what fixed it right up though? 8 liters of water and 17.5 miles of hiking.We hauled our butts to camp to get there before dark and saw Whitecap and Braids!

It really came down, actually. When we finally got to he Coolie Lady's house, it had stopped but we were soaked. At first I was confused because no one was around, but soon after, Marilyn (the cookie lady) came out with a couple cookies and told us where we could tent in her yard. Awesome!Later, my mom visited!

Being in a wet tent means that it's wet outside, which means that our shoes our damp, our food bag is soaked, and there are more than likely slugs on the tent. Being in a wet tent means that we wake up in a puddle INSIDE the tent--somehow--which means that my sleeping pad is soaked and my sleeping bag is damp. Waking up in a wet tent means that we will more than likely take over an hour to pack up and get going because we have to vigorously shake out the oversized, soggy mass that is our tent. It also means we will probably be in bad moods.We awkwardly arranged parts of the tent to hang on the outside of our bags in the hopes that it might dry as we hiked. Luckily, about four miles into the day, I came across a nice open, sunny, windy area near power lines where I spread out the tent fly and dried it right out (I found out later that Verge did the same thing.)For lunch, I sat in a stream and ate trail mix in the sun. It was fantastic. Thank you Vermont!We only had 14 miles to hike today to meet my friend Kyle, who was coming to visit!

Everything is covered in moss and delightful pine needles; however, there is a LOT of mud. A lot, a lot. On the trail today I met Wild Turkey and then also a girl named Mouse--she hikes with no poles--a rarity this far on the trail.We hiked up Glastenbury Mountain where there was a lookout tower on top. I hiked up and was immediately hit with a powerful wind and a beautiful view! All the scenery today was magical. The sun was shining through the pines into the moss in a way that looked like I should be in a fairytale. Vermont is just a wonderful magical forest and I love it.As we hiked further and further, my back started to hurt more and more. We had pretty heavy bags because we were trying to make a 5 day resupply last 7 days because my mom said she wanted to resupply us when she does trail magic for us on Thursday! Not only did my back hurt, but we realized that deer flies are a big issue in Vermont. They were relentless! They are so much harder to kill too! You land a hard smack, and they somehow still fly away unharmed. We were planning on hiking past the shelter if we got there before 7:40, but we got there at 7:42 and our buddies Mountain Goat, Princess Peach, and Great P were there, so we stayed.

We enjoyed their company as we prepared and ate our dinner; we also met Curry and a section hiker named Cardinal65. Peach threw a toad at me.

This was particularly special to me for a couple reasons:1: I hiked up Stratton to pick up my parents from one of their training hikes last summer--a couple of my first steps on the AT ever!2: Stratton was where Benton MacKaye first got the idea to create the Appalachian Trail!3: I can tell the terrain is changing. 4: I can taste the finish line.It was chilly all day! It was in the 60s, and later in the day it reached the 70s, but it was still windy and gorgeous. Perfect! I was SO happy all day. It definitely was muddy, though. I told myself, you just have to avoid the mud by finding the best routes and skillfully hopping from rock to root to rock root, but alas, I hopped onto what I thought was a barely hidden rock, which actually turned out to be a VERY deep mud pit (it went up to my knee). Oops.At about 18 or 19 miles in, I started to get tired, but the terrain was being pretty nice to me. There was even a nice long section of a dirt road that sloped downhill for a while! 2 miles left uphill, and I decided to rinse my shoes in a babbling brook in the hopes that it would get the mud off--who cares if it got my foot wet, they were already wet from mud.I got to the shelter, and no one else was there yet. It was a nice, big shelter and it didn't seem too buggy, so I set up my stuff.

It's really cool to see the collision of all the different types of hikers, but it also means the trail is more crowded than usual.

Some kind of coniferous-ish tree (specific, right?) It smells like pine and honey and home and christmas. I love it.I hiked for a while with Mountain Goat until we got to a very steep hill where he proceeded to show me (unintentionally) how he got his trail name. He hopped right up that WALL of a hill like it was nothing! Here I am, huffing and puffing and my legs are burning, and I'm going at a pretty decent speed, but he was GONE! I eventually caught up with him at the top, where there was a nice look out spot and place for a snack.

We all had some lunch and took a refreshing dip. We also met Starbrother and Spooney, who knew Bombadil and apparently ask any two girls they saw if they were Bombadil's daughters. They were so happy to have actually found them! Great P caught up with us at the lake as well.After my dip in the lake, I felt so refreshed and ready to hike! It was really fun to put my music on and push myself as fast as I could go! I had the energy, why not use it?! About 5 miles later, I ran out of that wonderful energy, but still had 3ish miles to go. Some babbling brooks and beaver ponds later, I passed a couple cute families out for days hikes with curious little kids bombarding me with questions about my hike. It was really sweet, and I hope maybe a couple of them will become future AT hikers!I continued on my way, turned a corner, and saw a naked backpacker. Well that was a surprise. I averted my gaze, said hello, and continued walking, but after he left, I realized that there was that family I had just passed! Questionable location and timing, naked man. Did you get the wrong date for hike naked day? Or are you just a friendly nudist? Or are you attempting to thru-hike the whole AT naked? Hmm..I arrived at Little Rock Pond to find Mountain Goat and Long Cloud relaxing by the water and a loon making its goofy call. Bliss.When Great P, Peach, and Verge arrived, we all set up and went swimming! There was this big cool boulder across the pond that looked fun to jump off of, so we went to go check it out. It turns out, we're a little rusty on the upper body strength side of things, but it was still super fun (and pretty comical). The big boulder didn't look quite safe enough to jump off of, but we found other rocks to jump from. Then we all raced back across the pond, and Great P showed us his butterfly-stroke. 18 miles of hiking and an hour or so of swimming really burned us out. After a yummy dinner, some hanging out by the fire (Slim Rims and Mouse joined us), and entertaining bear-bagging shenanigans, we all turned in for an early bedtime.

It was in the upper 80s, and we had to hike up a very steep hill (and then go 6 more miles after that as well). Even though I'm not a fan of ""end-of-the-day"" hikes at all, we managed and got to the shelter just before 8. We also passed a HUGE milestone (or miletree as the case may be--pictured above).

I didn't know there was a storm coming; I thought it would just continue to be harmless thunder rumblings and scattered showers...boy, was I wrong.Verge and I got to the top of the hill, and all of a sudden the sky got incredibly dark. Scary dark. The wind forcefully came at us out of nowhere. It was intense, and frankly, I was pretty terrified. The trees were swaying, and based on all the branches that littered the ground already, it was a pretty high likelihood that more would fall soon. Well, the coming storm definitely kicked us into high gear, but then the rain came. It started pouring so hard, I could barely see! It was even hurting my skin! That's when I realized it was hailing! It had gone from 90 degrees and sunny to HAILING and cold! Oh, New England...The storm was downright scary! We debated taking cover in a shelter we were passing that was 0.1 off the trail, but we decided maybe it would be safer to just continue down the mountain and get to lower elevation. Safer from the hail, maybe, but because we were going downhill on the trail, which had turned into a muddy stream, I fell and scraped up my whole leg. Oops. Ow! I was now covered in mud, scratched up, and getting beaten by rain and hail, but Verge and I decided to belt out, ""If you like pina coladas and getting caught in the rain!"" etc. We came across one other hiker going southbound who asked us if we had angered the gods. The storm passed, and we still had quite a few more miles to go. We met a southbounder named Handmaid (all of his gear was made out of things he had lying around the house--pretty cool! The last two miles of the day were the worst. Because my shorts were wet and muddy from the rain and from falling, my inner thighs started chafing really badly. It got worse and worse, until it got to the point where it felt like I was on fire! We blasted up a steep hill where there were cows and a sunset on top, which was nice, but I was in so much pain and we were rushing to get to the bottom of the hill before it got too dark. By the time we got down, I was white knuckling it from the pain, wincing with every step, and trying to sing to distract myself (to no avail). Thankfully, we had a nice spot to tent by a river, and I enjoyed one of the best trail meals ever--parmesan pasta side with a pink salmon packet dumped in it. It was so delicious and so comforting. It felt really good to have reached our mileage goal for the day because we were definitely tempted more than once to cut the day short. Perseverance! Also, you know it was a rough day when getting caught in a hail storm was the highlight of the day...","Thunderhill Road

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543459,"Wet tent again this morning, but guess what--it doesn't matter because tonight I'm going to be in Lebanon staying at my grandparents' house! I'll be sleeping in a DRY bed! In DRY, CLEAN clothes! On LEVEL ground!So, you'd think that because I knew that I'd be at my grandparents' house tonight that I would hike faster, right? Well, apparently, that actually means that I have zero motivation. Vermont did all that it could to make me more motivated. The sky was blue, not a cloud in sight, barely any bugs AT ALL, beautiful views, gorgeous flowers, sunshine, a floral breeze, difficult though enjoyable terrain, ECSTASY! I just was definitely in a ""sit on a porch and drink iced tea"" kind of mood, not a ""let's hike 20 miles"" kind of mood.We did our best. We soaked up the sun (and tried not to burn our translucent skin), munched on bunches of raspberries, and snacked a lot. When it got really difficult to keep going, we played a story-telling game. Verge said, ""Okay, make a story about the renaissance and pirates,"" so obviously I came up with a story about a boring girl in the time of the renaissance who was upset that everyone was good at things besides her. One day, she saw a strange ship come ashore and the hunky captain saved her after she fell out of her window, and she snuck aboard and soon realized it was actually a time machine...etc. Then I told Verge that she had to come up with a story about elves and a magical lollipop, so she proceeded to tell an awesome story about an elf that invented a lollipop that every time you licked it you would get inspired, and he hid it away because it would be too powerful of a weapon when in the wrong hands, but of course years later someone found it and--plot twist--a dog licked it and got really smart and found a little girl companion and they went to go find the elves who created the lollipop...etc. This game was QUITE entertaining, but it didn't last long because we ran out of energy and inspiration...guess we needed a magical lollipop.Finally, there were only 3.5 miles left until Hanover, NH. I decided to book it the rest of the way. I started to get filled with so much excitement and adrenaline. Only like 3 miles until New Hampshire? WHAT?! HOW did that happen?! Hiking down the hill, my emotions started to go a little wacky. At first, I was so thrilled that I was almost to New Hampshire! This is the state I've been most eager to reach! I've been dreaming of the perfect few days at my grandparents' house since I started the trail! But then, it hit me. I only have two states left. Two. Two out of fourteen. I will only have 442 miles left. That sounds like a lot, but in comparison to 1,747, it's nothing! I started to tear up. Only 442 miles left means that this adventure is coming to an end. I really don't want it to end...but I quickly told myself to cut it out and suck it up. Save the tears for Katahdin! (because there will be tears on Katahdin...)There was a lot of road walking towards the end, so I was able to hike really quickly. I couldn't stop smiling. I could hear NH calling my name!! The Connecticut river was finally in sight, and I couldn't take it any longer! I started running! I'm sure I was quite a sight, with my 25lb pack bouncing on my back as I not-so-gracefully ran across the bridge towards the border of Vermont and New Hampshire. I made it!! I've now officially hiked from Georgia to New Hampshire. Man, that feels amazing. I saw a lifeguard down below who saw me cheering, and he cheered with me.I finished the day hiking into Hanover, seeing Dartmouth, and running to hug my grandpa, who was waiting by his car in town. Verge arrived shortly after, and my grandpa took us to see the place where my parents met and worked together called, ""Everything But Anchovies."" Then we all went to get ice cream at our favorite little spot in Lebanon called the Dairy Twirl. Grandma was waiting at home with the most delicious egg salad I've ever had. The night ended with everyone falling asleep to an old NCIS episode on Netflix (while I sat here catching up on my blog). What a day. Can't wait to have a much needed day off of hiking tomorrow.","Woodstock Stage Road

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544033,"Verge and I were originally going to hike today, but we decided we just both really needed a day off both for our bodies as well as our minds. My grandparents told us we were all invited to go to Grafton Pond (one of our favorite places to go when we're here) with their friends Jim and Regina, so we packed up the boats, made some lunch, and were off! Verge and I took kayaks and my grandparents and their friends each had a canoe, and we all paddled off into the sunny pond to explore the maze of islands. My kayak sliced through the water as I pushed myself to go faster, weaving around the islands and coming back to the group, panting. As I sat still in the water, admiring the beauty that surrounded me, I saw a loon and its fluffy brown chick poke out of the water nearby. I sat for a while, hoping they'd get closer, but I heard a distant, ""Legs!"" so I paddled away to find the group.Time to find a nice island to have lunch on! We all relaxed and ate lunch in the shade until Verge decided it was time for some swimming. She decided to kayak to the a nearby island where there was a rope swing; I decided I wanted to get more swimming in, so I swam to the island and we played on the rope. (It wasn't really a rope ""swing"" but more of a rope hanging off a tree that leaned into the water, which you could attempt to climb up. It required all of our upper body strength--and then some--to get even part of the way up the rope, but it was so fun trying!) I swam back to the other island via an extended route where I got to swim around a different island, too (I LOVE swimming). With the sky threatening to storm and a group explorers aching for a nap, it was time to go home. We all relaxed the rest of the day, and Verge and I went out for a trip to the grocery store (with a stop at the Dairy Twirl on the way back). What a perfect day.","Hanover, NH

The hike was lovely and went very quickly! I decided that even though I didn't need all my gear for the day because we were going back to our grandparents' house that night, I would still hike with my regular pack on my back with most of my stuff in it. Though I'm not opposed to slackpacking in any way, I'd prefer to limit the percentage of my trip that I slackpack. I view it as a nice trail magic treat to do once in a while. Perhaps some other day this week we'll slackpack!Strangely, we didn't see many people we knew, which was a surprise because typically when we hike southbound we see everybody! We did see Mouse, Stryder, and Scavenger, the elder though. It's great to see so many people out and about hiking! After a few tumbles and a short steep climb up to Velvet rocks, we got into Hanover, which was sadly not very well blazed (we thought), and met my grandpa to go back home to their house in Lebanon.

Later, we adjourned to the outside deck where we relaxed and sampled some Long Trail Ale and Angry Orchard Cider. My grandpa came out and started up the grill, and we enjoyed some spectacularly cooked burgers, sausages, and veggie burgers (well, Verge and I enjoyed the veggie burgers...) After dinner and clean up, we started an intense round of Pictionary. It was such a close game! Princess Peach, Mountain Goat, Sweets, and I pulled ahead to victory at the very end, however. It was definitely Princess Peach's beautiful drawing of the Eiffel Tower that sealed the deal.On to Bocce Ball! Sweets and I took on Mountain Goat and Jingle, and although they won the first round, we slaughtered them the next! Better luck next time, guys. As the sun set behind the trees, my grandpa herded us up the hill to the bonfire he'd made for us. Mountain Goat had the honor of lighting the fire (with a blowtorch), and it was spectacularly huge and HOT! We attempted s'mores, but you couldn't even get close enough to it without feeling at high risk for spontaneous combustion. As it cooled down and settled into a pile of glowing embers, however, we were all able to huddle closer and make some s'mores while lying in the grass, staring up at the stars, and listening to music. We were blessed with a beautiful, clear, cool summer evening; we could even see the milky way.A few sleepyheads wandered off towards the house, following the calls of their warm, dry, comfy beds, but the few of us who stayed awake enjoyed some midnight hot tubbing under the stars.

We are not used to going under 1 mile an hour. Then, we entered the actual Whites. Getting up to the Kinsman ridge trail was fine, and Mt Wolf was also fine, but we still weren't moving very quickly. Oh, and it was raining. It was a cold drizzle all day, and I'm definitely sick. My nose is completely clogged, and it's making it difficult to breathe. I feel drained. We then got to hike alongside Eliza brook, which was gorgeous. I think if it was a beautiful day, I definitely wouldn't be able to pass up those killer swimming holes. Definitely coming back here sometime. But then, Kinsman happened. For one, it was ridiculously steep. On top of that, it was all slick rock climbing in the cold rain. It was neverending.We finally began our descent, but that was only more dangerous than going up was. It was steep, slippery, and starting to get darker. I was in contact with the hostel because originally, we were going to try to be there by 6 for the shuttle, but we realized that wasn't going to happen even though we left at 7am! 13 excruciating hours later...and we still had to find the liberty springs parking area. It was a whole mile off trail, which we speed walked (not sure how because our ankles and knees and spirits were shot) and didnt get there until 8:30. We got to the hostel, and even though it's only been two days of hiking since my grandparents, my clothes are already disgusting from my strenuous hiking, all day rain, numerous falls, and general hiker grossness. I was excited because I saw laundry was included at this hostel, which is not always the norm, but I was quickly shot down when they told me we missed group laundry at 6 and any additional laundry is $5. That's all it took; my tears spilled over. I couldn't bear the thought of hiking another 5 days through the Whites in clothes that smelled like rain funk, body odor, and pee. By the time we even got to the hostel it was 9pm and we were beyond exhausted, so although she took pity on me and said we could just use the machines, all we had time to do was shower, stuff our faces, and pass out. Tie-dye, the owner, was super nice and helped us find all the unclaimed leftovers in the fridge, and we fashioned ourselves an amazing heap of spaghetti and vegetables. We even got ice cream for dessert. It was pretty funny to see the extreme contrast between the happy, clean sobos and sectioners hanging out and having fun and Verge and me coming in mud-streaked, weary, bruised, scraped, tear stained (in my case), and just generally beaten down. I didn't really have energy to chat, so I hope I didn't come off as rude. Oh, and to put the cherry on top of the day, my time of the month arrived that night. ROUGH DAY.

It was starting to get dark, and South Twin loomed above us, but we decided to push on. We stopped into Galehead hut for some water (we didn't know we could just go in the huts--we thought they were special and only paying guests could go in--not the case!

I have a nasty phlegmy cough and a stuffy nose. We didn't get started until past 9am. Something you should know about the Whites is that they are VERY poorly blazed. The only way you know you're going the right way is if someone etched an ""AT"" symbol into the sign with an arrow pointing which way to go. Boo. We were doing okay with this system until this morning. We reached a sign that said Guyot shelter 0.6 to the right, and we knew (based on our guides) that Guyot shelter was only supposed to be 0.2 off trail, so we thought we'd follow the sign and maybe it turned off somewhere. WRONG. We ended up summiting Mt Guyot and going downhill towards the shelter almost 0.4 miles before we realized we were going the wrong way. We back-tracked up and over Guyot the 0.4ish to the sign. The other faded side of the sign showed us the way to Zeacliffs--the way we were supposed to go. Lo and behold there was a faded etched AT symbol. Well...nice start to the day.At least it was sunny out! The terrain improved the day as well. It was easy, gradual, and relaxing. What?! No, but really. It was lovely. We made good time to Zealand Falls and the Zealand Hut where we enjoyed a nice bowl of potato leek soup and a piece of blueberry coffee cake. Yum! We chatted a little with the chef there as well as the Ethan Pond caretaker and told them we were planning on going to Mizpah Hut that night, which would be a 19 mile day. ""That's not normal is it?"" the chef asked. ""It's a bit extreme,"" the caretaker replied and looked at us incredulously. Well that was a boost to our pride. Maybe we'll even get there! The next 5 miles were beautiful and flat. It was great! We then had a nice downhill and arrived at the base of Webster Mountain at 4pm. 4 hours to go 6.5 more miles to Mizpah. Should be doable?Little did we know...this was a monster mountain! Hardest 3 miles. Maybe it was because I was so tired. Maybe it was because I had to use all my strength to hurl my body up steep rock faces. It was awful. I kept telling myself how much I'd enjoy it if I didn't have my heavy pack. It was so hard, and I was so beat. My hips were chafing really badly, which has never happened before, and my armpit was starting to chafe too. I was having trouble breathing from my stuffy nose and phlegmy cough. The sun was starting to set. My tiredness level skyrocketed and I started to break down. I can't do this! I can't! I'm so tired! I bent over to push myself up more rocks, and I broke down. I started bawling. Verge came around the corner and patted me on the back, and after a minute, I was okay again. I just needed to let it out. The rest of the way was a little better. We got over Jackson Mountain, and the sky gave us another beautiful sunset. It was 7pm and we had 3 miles left. We booked it, and got there around 8. We did it! We got to Mizpah! We walked into the hut and were greeted by our buddies Jingle, Sweets, and Wheels who were doing work for stay.

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545304,"What a beautiful day! We have been SO lucky with sunshine. Stellar, Mcdoubles, Verge, and I all got shuttled back to the trailhead and started hiking around 8am. Verge and I met Chopper, who is also hiking with his sibling, Mountaingoat! He also apparently knows dad. I feel like everyone we run into these days know him or knows our story or just met him and was told to look out for us. Pretty neat.
We leapfrogged Diatom, Mola, Helter, Mcdoubles, Stellar, and Spacious all day. We also met Chaser, a nice fellow with a southern accent and blonde dreadlocks. As we were going up Mt Success (quite the steep ascent) we broke through the tree line and saw a huge sheet of rain coming our way! Uh oh! We kicked into high gear and got moving up the mountain, but it started raining on us, making everything crazy slick. Luckily, it passed pretty quickly, but everything was still all wet. We did pretty well hopping and sliding down the mountain, but we were so eager for Maine!! 
Finally! We reached the sign. Wow. LAST STATE! Insane. Only 280 or so miles left. 
The last bit before the shelter was quite the introduction to Maine. It was a very difficult boulder maneuver that almost killed Verge! She was hanging off a ledge with nowhere to put her feet; it was pretty scary. 
It was a nice group at the shelter. Mostly all the people we'd been leap frogging all day, but we also met Crooner and Fugitive. We got to the shelter before 7, so we even had time for a nice relaxing hot dinner AND cocoa. Hallelujah.","The Barn Hostel

Verge and I discovered our new favorite oatmeal: raspberries, chia, raisins, and dates. The dates and raspberries really made it. It has to be hot to be perfect though. Yum! So much yum! Perfect breakfast. We got going by 8:30ish, and then we ran into Farmer! We first met Farmer on our second day into the trail so it's really cool to be seeing him now in Maine, the end of the trail. The day started rough and windy, but at least it was sunny. The wind was so strong it was blowing me over! Actually pushing me over. Insane. I've rarely experienced wind like that. We did about 4 miles in like 3 hours. Uh-oh; maybe Maine is more like NH than I realized. We stopped for water at a shelter and ran into Farmer again as well as Stellar. Stellar ended up accompanying us to Mahoosuc Notch and THROUGH the notch as well! He was great company, and I'm glad none of us died through the notch because Holy Crap! The boulders were huge and awkwardly placed and difficult to scramble over and hop from one to the other. Sometimes you even had to take off your pack and push yourself through a cave! (Pictured above). I came upon Mola, Diatom, and Helter at a nice water source and said, ""Well that was fun huh?"" To which Mola replied, ""You're only halfway done..."" What?! We'd only gone half a mile?! The whole thing definitely took over an hour; probably and hour and a half or so, and it's only a mile of trail. Wow. They weren't kidding when they said it was the slowest/hardest mile on trail.We were going up the Mahoosuc Arm (a steep uphill) when it started raining again. Once again, it wasn't for too long, but it was enough to made everything slick and dangerous. Most people we'd been hiking with all day called it quits at the shelter 9.5 miles in (to which we all arrived at about 5pm). We wanted to stay so badly, but we pushed on up Speck Mountain. It was a beautiful view of Maine with all its mountains and lakes. Everything was wet, and we were exhausted, so we got about 5 more miles in before dark. Such a long, difficult day, again. I underestimated Maine. 14 miles in 12 hours (that's including breaks, but still, blah.) We got to the grafton notch parking area, and Verge went to look for a stealth spot while I cooked dinner in the parking lot.

I'm so excited, but that means we have to bust our butts to go 10 miles (were originally planning on going 2 miles further yesterday but underestimated the difficulty so now we have to go those 2 miles this morning) to get to mom as fast as we can! She said she'd be at the road crossing into Andover (East B Hill rd) from 11-3ish. We went over Bald Pate Mountain, which is actually one of my new favorite mountains on trail. It was yet another sunny beautiful day, and the trail was gradual and very well maintained. It was awesome! It was also so open and rocky on top. I loved it. We met Curly and Jetson, and we also saw Farmer and told them to hurry to get to trail magic.After a steep downhill (steep like they had a rope to help you get to the ladder they put there to help you get down parts of it...silliness), we saw Napster having lunch at the shelter, so we told him about trail magic too! We basically ran the few miles downhill (murdering our already ruined knees) and found mom and Judy hiking the last mile towards us! What a nice surprise! Trail magic was delicious--my favorite parts being the hard boiled eggs, pickles, carrots and hummus, and the Oreos and nutter butters. Mmmmm. Thanks mom!! She had people sign a card, so I saw everyone who's come through. She got over 40 people!She then let me take her car (and a couple hikers--Fire, Toasty, and Crooner) into Andover. We grabbed our box, had some ice cream, and popped back over to see her. In the last minutes before she left, we were surprised by Jingle and Sweets! We thought they might be further behind us! Glad to see they're not. My mom had to go, and I wished I'd gotten to spend more time with her, but I'm so glad she came.Verge and I had 6 more miles to go at 5pm. Not too bad. We had a fun time chatting, and though I'm still hacking stuff up, my sickness is mostly better. Almost. We got to the shelter as it was getting too dark to see, and we were both very angry with how terrible the trail maintenance was on the last mile to the shelter. We got there, bearbagged, had a conversation with the fellow in the shelter about the concept of bearbagging, which was interesting. See, the point of bearbagging, besides safety, is as a preventative measure against bears seeing humans as a way to get food. Bears should stay wild and stay afraid of humans. If you make it easy for them for take food from you, they'll be less afraid of you and less able to keep getting food their own way in the wild.

When would be the next time we could shower and do laundry? When was our next near-o? When did we think we might catch dad? These aren't easy questions to answer! Especially when the post office is involved and also when all the towns these days are so far off trail.

As we were working these things out, Jingle, Sweets, and Wheels rolled in! (Shows how much earlier they wake up...they were 4 miles behind us). We chatted and hiked up Moody Mtn with them, which they thought was fine because it was talked up so much (one lady said it would be worse than the Mahoosuc Arm), but me and my phlegmy lungs--pardon the excuses--had a harder time. I suppose mostly I'm just really tired. My legs don't feel like going uphill anymore. Or downhill.

We hiked up Old Blue as well as Bemis Mtn, leapfrogging all day with Spielburg, Mouse, Mcdoubles, Fugitive, Sweets, Jingle, and Wheels--a much bigger group than we've been near in a while! We also came across some lovely blueberries on Bemis. Yum! 

Verge and I raced over Bemis, eager to get to the campsite 4 miles past where most of the others were staying (they'd started from an earlier spot), but we came across Bemis 2nd Peak and not only were we fed up with the tough day, but the sun was going down, and we just weren't feeling it. I told Verge of love to eat a quick dinner before we hiked the 2 miles downhill, and she barely agreed (she doesn't like doing that). 

After a crunchy dry ramen and some tuna and a phone call with dad where we found out he might be officially done with the trail because of his knee, Verge decided she was done with the day. I suggested we cowboy camp on these nice flat rocks with a lovely view and only a 20% chance of rain. She agreed. We also had service for the first time in a long while so I finally got to update my blog for like the last week! We'll see if we get rained on. Hope not!

(I think Mountain Goat and Peach would be proud of us for cowboy camping.)We had a few freshly picked blueberries in our oatmeal (yum) and were on our way by 7! At the stream 2 miles in we saw Mcdoubles and Fugitive and were joined by Jingle and Sweets. We hiked with them most of the day back and forth through the supposedly easier terrain (the small ups and downs are tiresome too!). We were aiming big for the day. 24 miles. We'd do our best!We were making good time for the day, though we were tired. Also, though some of Maine has great trail maintenance (like nicely built stone steps), a ton of it is awful and difficult to hike through. Forget the roots, it looks like a giant came and had a temper tantrum and ripped everything up and stomped on stuff. It's pretty bad. We recently discovered that our dad is zeroing in Rangelely (though he's 16 miles further than that on trail), so we were excited to know we'd meet him in Stratton, but sad to know we were passing right by an opportunity to see him in Rangeley. We were passing the road into Rangeley (16 miles into our day) at about 3:30 when the shuttle for the Farmhouse Hostel came by to pick up Spielburg, Cheap'n'Easy, Fugitive, and Shu. The owner, Stacey, came out and asked if we were Bombadil's daughters. We said yes, and she came over and hugged us and offered us a ride to go see him! We still had 8 more miles planned, but we couldn't pass up an opportunity like that! She even said she'd drive us back to the trail after!We all piled into the car (Sweets and Jingle included--though they only needed to go resupply), and I was filled with excitement at the prospect of seeing him early and surprising him. We got there, and he was indeed surprised! After a bone-crushing group hug, we got all settled and my dad offered to pay for us to stay! We figured out a post office fix of relocating our box and decided to stay. I'm so happy we're all reunited. Unfortunately, it seems Bombadil is very likely done hiking the trail. After about 2,000 miles (half of which was spent hobbling painfully on his messed up knee) he may be ready to hang up the trekking poles. I fully support whatever makes him happiest and healthiest. We went to the grocery store and Verge cooked us the best veggies ever. Yum! We then baked chocolate chip cookies to share with everyone at the hostel. It was a fun group! Training Wheels, Blazer, Farmer, Spielburg, Fugitive, Cheap'n'Easy, and Shu were there, and we met Juandurer, Homeward, Soup, Radar, Crasher, Deadwood, and a few others. It feels awesome to be clean and well fed. I wish Sweets and Jingle could have stayed! Hoping to catch Mountain Goat and Princess Peach soon. Not sure how far ahead they are.

It was disgustingly humid. I was melting. People had been talking about the storm coming, and the Farmhouse owner even gave us a safety speech and told us an emergency route to get down if we needed. Jeez! Everyone's freakin me out! I'm both nervous and excited for this storm.The rain came, and I was severely underwhelmed. It was just an annoying sprinkle that would keep you wet and chilly but wasn't actually very substantial. But then I got closer to the top, and the rain and wind immediately picked up. Torrential downpour! I was squinting through the pouring rain--it almost felt like hail it was raining so hard! I never bother to put my raincoat on in rain like that, and I don't have a pack cover so I don't have to worry about that either.For some reason, torrential downpours actually lift my spirits more than anything. It's like it washes away any and all negativity and gives me a new energy for the day. I couldn't stop smiling. I spread out my arms and embraced the free shower. It was fantastic. The trail got completely flooded to the point where I was splashing through streams deeper than my ankles while going up Saddleback Mountain. What an adventure! As I happily hiked up that mountain, I felt so in the moment. All I could hear was the wind whooshing past my ears and my shoes squishing up the rock faces and plowing through the rivers. I loved it. But then I had to go downhill...down completely slick flat rock faces. It slowed me way down and made me very annoyed. Hiking the horn was okay, but I started singing while going downhill and apparently that split my attention enough to make me slip and fall. Ow. Big ow. The rain eased up, but the slick rocks remained, so my spirits took a bit of a dive. Now, I'm just soaked and chilly and hungry and my everything hurts as I slowly maneuver down the steep mountains. There's no longer the wonderful accompaniment of the exhilarating rain. I finally got to the shelter and was happy to see Verge had waited for me. There were only 8 miles left for the day, and they went pretty quickly; however, I did start chafing. Badly. With about 5 miles remaining, I was in serious pain. The kind where you actually are wincing and gritting your teeth. Mind over matter? I'll give it a whirl. It worked for a bit, and with a pop tart snack came a new sugar energy. I was singing to myself and came across Verge and Soup. Soup provided us with thrilling and hilarious tales of his hunting camp experiences in Wyoming. A great distraction for a steep uphill near the shelter. We finally get there, and it's packed. I take a seat next to Sweets, who was cooking dinner, and I noticed I chafed so badly on my inner thighs that I was bleeding. I could barely walk. I waddled over to help Verge set up the tent (the shelter was very sadly full) and was happy to realize we'd made it to camp before 7pm. Woo!

I guess packing up everything soaked wouldn't be too awful. After a delicious chocolatey oatmeal (I put in a ""breakfast essentials"" packet--yum) and a long time procrastinating going hiking in the rain, we took the plunge. Out into the wet and the cold. We hiked the relatively difficult ""Crockers,"" and when I got to the topi called my dad to check in. I was hoping he might mention we could kidnap Jingle and Sweets and he did! Thankfully, they were on top of the mountain with me, and they were more than happy to hear they would get free showers and laundry two days sooner than they expected. Yay! We all had a nice time hiking down together (in the awful dreary rain), and we hit 2,000 miles together and took a couple fun pictures. I'm so happy to have hit this milestone with them since we've hiked so much of the trail together.

Verge and I were both in horrendous moods and were quite snippy with each other. We hate wet tent. Though the terrain had looked easy in our guides, the 4 mile downhill to the ferry took longer than we expected. It turns out going up and down small hills of wet rocks and roots is difficult, slow-going, and not very fun, especially if you frequently slip and fall and bang up your whole body.We got to the canoe ferry, which was neat. I got to help paddle across, and the ferry gentleman was nice. I have little to no motivation. In fact, I very much hate Maine. Today, Verge and I had to stop every 20 minutes to go pee, we slipped on rocks and roots all day, and we weren't moving very quickly, which when you're aiming to go 23 miles just sucks.It was 4pm, I aired out the tent on top of a bald, and I saw we still had 10.5 miles left, which breaks our ""no more than 10 miles after 4pm"" rule. (I made this rule because it totally sucks to still have 10 miles left to hike at 4pm...) Verge was insistent that we hike our 23 today so that we only had to do a relaxing 18 into Monson.

I was angry and tired, and I was adamant about staying. Logic won. I decided I'd try to push the four more miles at 6:45 up Moxie Bald Mountain. However, less than half a mile up, I had an anxiety attack. I couldn't breathe and I couldn't stop crying. It was...indescribably awful. I felt weak, and I knew Verge would be annoyed with me. I felt like I could just turn into a puddle. I tried to calm myself down.m because what's crying going to do? Just suck it up and hike...how about I hike while I cry? Okay...but then you can't breathe, so you probably shouldn't do that. Just breathe. In through your nose, out through your mouth...etc. I figured it out, but I was barely hanging on. Even the gorgeous sunset and the almost full moon on top of one of the prettiest hikes we've had yet couldn't change my attitude. After a slippery, wet, steep descent in the dark (had to get my headlamp out), we arrived at the shelter. Curly and Jetson had done the 23 too. I felt so bad flashing our headlamps around, looking for a spot to set up our tent. Mostly everywhere was full. It seems like a huge bubble of hikers are all aiming for Monson tomorrow.

She pushes me, and sometimes it sucks A LOT, but I'm sure it's making me stronger or better or something. We got going, and for once, the guidebook's interpretation of Maine terrain was semi-accurate. It was a beautiful, breezy, fall-like, day with semi-flat terrain and beautiful trails. I guess one of my main qualms with Maine trail is the horrible maintence. It feels forgotten and wild, which is cool and all, but SUCKS to hike through. So today it was wonderfully refreshing to have actually nice trail--wide, fewer rocks and roots, lots of cushiony pine needles, etc. it definitely wasn't like that all day; we tromped through tons and tons of deep mud and had to actually ford our first rivers, but it was much nicer. For the first part of the day, we talked about what 7 days left on trail means for us.Being done in seven days means not having permanent dirt smears on your legs.It means not wearing the same outfit everyday.It means getting to shower every day.It means not using leaves to blow your nose.It means not having to purify your water before drinking it.It means you don't have to carry your house on your back like a snail.It means having easy access to fresh fruits and veggies.It means not having to hike every day of you don't want to.It means not having to carry your trash with you where ever you go.It means not having bear bag every night.It means I can get a haircut.It means having the freedom to watch movies.It means freedom...The list goes on.The second part of the day, we ran into a nice couple with three gorgeous dogs, and the woman said she'd thru-hiked two years ago.

So weird. I'm thankful that I have both my job and school waiting for me when I go back, but I envy my friends who have a wide open future. They can do whatever they want! They say they envy me though, so I guess you always want what you don't have. Soon enough I'll be facing those same challenges after I graduate. What will be next for me? Don't know! I do know how lucky I feel to have met such an amazing community of people out here, and more specifically, Jingle, Sweets, Training Wheels, Mountain Goat, and Princess Peach are some of the best people I've ever met.

I was wishing all trail was that nice when I realized it probably all starts that way and then just gets compacted and eroded by all who hike on it. That made me sad. I know your doomed future, lovely section of comfy trail! I then forded a river and ran into a ridgerunner chatting with Curly, Jetson, and Footage, so I hung out by the sunny river for a while with them, waiting for Verge. She showed up a bit later, and we hiked the remaining 7 miles together. We got to camp before dark! Hurray! We got there and we're happy to once again see all our buddies, Jingle, Sweets, Mountain Goat, and Peach. Curly, Jetson, and Footage stayed there too, and I saw a guy named Goat we've met a couple times before, and Huff the section hiker joined later too. Still no Wheels though. Another long hard day coming to a close. I enjoyed dinner, though I've been hungry a lot lately. I'm thankful for my friends, and the wind felt amazing. It lulled me to sleep as if it was a chilly autumn evening.","Cloud Pond Lean-to

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546419,"We woke up so early this morning! (5:45am) We were even all packed up by about 6:30, but we had breakfast, so we didn't leave until 7am. Funny enough, we were the first ones out! We're usually the last ones out! (Like always!) We hiked up the steep West Peak, the relaxing Hay Mountain, and the steep Whitecap Mountain. The whole time we were in a foggy cloud with rain sprinkling on us a bit and lots of blustery Autumn winds. I really enjoyed it. We were supposed to have our first view of Katahdin from Whitecap, but we were in a cloud, so alas, no view yet.Four miles downhill later and Mountain Goat caught up. We chatted and hiked with him for a while, which was fun, and we learned we'd already hiked like 9 miles by 11am! That's a weird feeling--an awesome feeling! We sat by a sunny river for a little bit and had water and a snack. Mountain Goat went up ahead to be able to stop for a while at a fishing hole a few miles up trail. Oh! We also realized that today is our Five Month Trailiversary! Cool! Soon after, Princess Peach joined us and we got to hike and chat with him for a while! It's such a nice change when we get to chat and hike with buddies other than each other (though that is of course always fun...clearly--or we wouldn't still be hiking together after 2,100 or so miles). We then stopped randomly for a quick water break and Peach went ahead to meet up with Mountain Goat, but our ""quick"" stop turned into us sitting on a rock near the trail, drinking water, munching on trail mix, enjoying the breeze and the dappled sunlight through the trees. It was utterly marvelous. When we started hiking again, it lead to a conversation of our favorite moments on trail, which was fun to reminisce about. The terrain was fabulous the whole rest of the way (the remaining 11 miles). It was pine-needley and gradual and wonderful. The sunshine and breeze continued to accompanied us, and after we ran into Mountain Goat again (sadly, fishing had not been successful), he hiked with us for about 6 more miles, and we chatted about food and books and movies. We got to camp, cleaned up a bit in the nice pond, and Jingle and Sweets arrived! We all cooked dinner together by the fire that Mountain Goat and Peach made, and Goat, Panda, Whip, and Jelly Dog all joined us. Moments like these are the moments I'll miss. Everyone together, happy though hungry, having a great time. We even did 25 miles and got to camp by 6pm! Today was as close to a perfect day as you can get.","Sidney Tappan Campsite

We quickly packed up our tent and saw that Jingle, Sweets, and Peach were all still tucked away in their tents. Mountain Goat was happily sipping some coffee in his raincoat. Verge and I got going, and though it was wet, our spirits were high. We hiked down the trail singing ""We all live in a yellow submarine"" at the top of our lungs.After a little while being wet, however, I got into cuddley mode. All I really felt like doing was watch Lord of the Rings and cuddle up in a blanket with some cocoa. Alas, I choose hiking! Everyone took turns hiking with us throughout the day--Mountain Goat, Peach, Jingle, and Sweets, and at lunch Jingle, Sweets, Verge, and I aired out our soaking wet tents.The last 6 miles of the day, I decided to go really fast--I was pretty done with the day...also, Peach said, ""6:10? More like 6:45! It's slippery and downhill!"" I obviously had to prove him wrong...and no song gets me moving faster than ""Danza Kuduro,"" so I got there at 6:05. Glad I didn't slip and hurt myself...I got to the Rainbow Stream Lean-to and was greeted by Mountain Goat, Goat, Big Foot the Good, Fire, Toasty, Panda, and Whiplash. Peach and Verge arrived very shortly after, followed by Jingle and Sweets. We all huddled by the fire, as it was a chillier night, and had a lovely dinner together.

It was a spectacularly beautiful day, my favorite kind--breezy, sunny, cool. We had lunch by a bright blue lake, glittering in the sunshine, accompanied by loon's calls. We got to Abol Bridge by 3ish and met up with our friends at the Northern Outdoors restaurant. We were later joined by Training Wheels! It turns out she was never too far behind in the 100 mile wilderness, so she showed up just a couple hours later. So glad she's here to join us for the last couple days so that we can all be together.Verge and I had fun resupplying for our last two days on trail because we had no box, so we could pick as many fun random things as we wanted! We got some cookies, pop tarts, crackers, tuna, and a couple other random snacks that made us happy (though it was quite expensive...)Everyone (Mountain Goat, Princess Peach, Jingle, Sweets, Wheels, Goat, Panda, Whiplash, Mumbles, Jelly Dog, NH Bob) then hung out at a picnic table by Abol bridge, drinking and reminiscing, as the sun set behind the trees. Fantastic...but Bittersweet. We went back to our little tentsite in the woods and all helped make a fire. With so many people there, it took less than 5 minutes to collect a huge pile of wood! It was pretty comical to watch, as some were quite intoxicated. Verge and I then went on a nice night walk with Mountain Goat and Princess Peach to go check out the sign up sheet, which was really fun. They're awesome; I love them.

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547247,"I did not sleep very well. Partly because of excitement, partly because of a slanted ground, and partly because Panda, Whiplash, Jelly Dog, and Mumbles woke up at 2:30am, listening to ""Final Countdown"" and ""Eye of the Tiger"" to pump them up for hiking all the way to Katahdin and down in one stretch! Their music pumped me up too! I was just about ready to hop up out of my tent and join them! I can't believe by the end of the day, they'll be done...We all woke up and raced for the sign up sheet. Unfortunately, only 12 people are allowed at the The Birches Campsite at a time, which means you could get screwed out of summiting the day you want to (unless you hitch to and from Millinocket, get really lucky and yogi a private lean-to, or hike all the way there in one stretch like Panda, Whip, Jelly Dog, and Mumbles). It's an annoying way of doing things, in my opinion, but I do understand they're trying to lessen the impact of hikers in Baxter State Park. Thankfully, we all got there and got on the list. After having breakfast at a picnic table, we all hiked in one big eight person line towards our goal for the day--The Birches. It's only a ten mile day, so the whole time we got to hang out and relax and have a wonderful, ceremonial, last hike with the people I've come to adore--Mountain Goat, Peach, Jingle, Sweets, Wheels, Verge, and Goat (a recent addition to our motley crew). We decided to call ourselves: The Super8. We got to swim in a river, ford a stream, have lunch at ""Big Niagra Falls,"" and chat and sing in our silly hiker train. We were also blessed with gorgeous weather and beautiful terrain. The last mile of the trail was the most easy walking of the whole AT. Then again, it could have been because I felt like I was on Cloud Nine. Am I actually here?Even with all our meandering, we got to the park by 1pm. So much time to do nothing! We hung out, made a fire, played some cards, and went to bed. Mountain Goat, Peach, and Goat had ambitious plans to wake up at 2am, hike up in the dark, and summit for sunrise. Jingle, Sweets, Wheels, Verge, and I decided we'd wake up at 4:30ish, have breakfast, then leave, so we stayed up a little later. A couple nice people nearby even came over with some fresh strawberries and reese's trail magic! It was so unexpected and amazing.Tomorrow! Tomorrow! Katahdin, tomorrow.

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547253,"After having breakfast in the dark, we were on our way. On our way to finish our journey. To finally reach the goal we've all been aiming for in the past five months. The word ""surreal"" has lost all meaning at this point.We began our ascent at 6:01am and saw on the register that Peach, Mountain Goat, and Goat had began their's at 2:30am. They did it! I was so scared of Katahdin. Everyone has constantly said how hard it is, how it's a vertical Mahoosac Notch, how it's nothing like we've hiked on the trail. These things are basically true, but I still enjoyed the hell out of it. It wasn't quite as crazy-difficult as I thought (because I'd blown it up so much in my head). It was SO FUN! I was also basically shaking with excitement, and I couldn't stop smiling. It was a perfectly clear, beautiful day, and the view on the way up was gorgeous. After rock climbing over the humungous boulders, walking through ""The Gateway"" across to the top, the top was in sight. It felt like a graduation or something. I couldn't get ""Pomp and Circumstance"" out of my head until Sweets started singing ""We will still be friends forever"" (don't know if that's actually the name, but it's that sad, sappy, graduation song you always hear...and it definitely made me feel sad and sappy...) When the sign came into view, Verge and Sweets started running towards it. My legs were tired, but I managed an increase in speed. Time of arrival: 9:00am.I'm here. I'm at the top. I did it. I did it? I did it! Mountain Goat, Peach, and Goat had summited by 5am, hiked the Knife's Edge, and returned to wait for us to summit. They welcomed us to the finish with a round of applause and lots of hooting and hollering. We all took our pictures, snacked a bit, and enjoyed the amazing view from the top. We couldn't have summited on a more perfect day. We hiked down, and it felt like we were just hiking down any other mountain. It felt like we were just going to party the night away and keep hiking tomorrow...even though I knew we weren't going to.We got a ride into Millinocket from a nice couple touring the area, got a room at the AT Lodge, had dinner, Jingle's friends Brett and Chad joined us, Peach made toaster-oven lava cake-brownies, we drank, celebrated, played pool at the bar, and had an all-around amazing time on our last night together. It feels weird to even type ""last night together."" We've talked trail magic reunions though...so not really our ""last"" night together. I can't even think about it.","The Birches

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547256,"I had to say my goodbyes to Jingle last night because he's staying in a different hotel. I know I'll see him again, but it still hurts. Jingle has become a brother to me over these past five months. He's one of the best people I've ever met in my life, and I feel so lucky that I've gotten to experience so much of this journey with him. Love you, Jingle.The next morning, Princess Peach comes running into my room yelling, ""BREAKFAST BREAKFAST BREAKFAST!"" He picks me up, drops me, picks Verge up, and falls over. ""It's time for breakfast guys!"" We all went to the AT Cafe for breakfast, and Peach was the next to leave. I gave him a big hug (and giggled when I felt his goofy fanny pack between us), and then he was gone. I'm going to miss him making me laugh all the time. Love you, Peach.The next two to go were Sweets and Training Wheels. Oh, Wheels. I'm going to miss her funny, grumpy remarks and her sweet laugh. I still can't believe she hiked 37 miles after being jilted by a silly boy to come see me and all our buddies on my birthday. Love you, Wheels. I know Sweets was trying to get me to cry, and you know what, she was successful. I immediately teared up mid-hug. You really learn true friendship out here. I'm so happy I met her within the first 100 miles of my trip. I'm going to say it every time--I'm going to miss her so much. I'm going to miss her making funny faces, saying, ""Penny Lane"" in her funny voice, and saying ""So fresh and so clean, clean"" every time she brushed her teeth. Love you, Sweets.And then there were three. Verge, Mountain Goat, and I just hung around, waiting to get picked up. To pass the time, Mountain Goat and I played some checkers (he beat me) and some chess (tie game?). Then his parents came and they treated us to lunch at the AT Cafe, which was so unexpected and generous of them, and I really appreciated it. Then Mountain Goat was on his way too. Why does everyone have to leave? Again, Mountain Goat is one of my favorite people of the whole trail. His positivity rivaled mine, he was always up for going for a swim, teaching me about the stars, or playing a game, and I'm really going to miss him. I'm going to miss everyone. I could probably write a book if I wrote a sweet little paragraph about everyone I've met and learned from and loved on the trail. This community of people is truly spectacular, and I feel blessed to have been able to be a part of it. It has really opened my eyes to the kinds of people I want to spend my time with. The trail has opened my eyes to a lot. Maybe I will write a book.Thank you again to all who have been following my journey and filling my adventure with words of encouragement, support, and positivity.

Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547977,"I got off the mountain, and I knew that I was in shock. I knew that I would just need to process and then I would know what it felt like to be done. The next day came...and it still didn't feel real. I thought maybe with all my closest pals leaving, I'd feel it, but I still didn't. Don't get me wrong, I definitely didn't like saying goodbye, but it's almost like saying goodbye didn't feel real either. My mom came to pick us up and brought us to the beach to meet up with my dad. A beach day after hiking for 2,000 miles seemed like an awesome, relaxing way to ease out. Of course the beach day was great, and we even went the next day too! (where a seagull promptly stole my phone along with a bag of food...but lots of luck made it so that someone found my phone and returned it to the office where we had left a number in case it was found--yay!) But being at the beach kind of just felt like a mini trail vacation. I still felt like I was just going to go back to the trail the next day and keep hiking. I'm done? Done hiking? Done seeing the people I'm used to seeing everyday and living the way I've been living for 5 months? Really done? It started to kick in more when I went to my grandparents' house on the way home, but the real kicker was when I got home. Now, I EXPECTED that when I got home I'd feel weird and out of place, but what I DIDN'T anticipate is how normal it would feel at the same time. A day went by at home, and I felt like the trail had just been this elaborate dream and that I just woke up to regular life and it was the same as it always had been. It was a really jarring feeling. Aren't I supposed to feel different? I know that I've grown and changed, but everything here is still the same; it just smells worse. No more amazingly fresh air. What's worse is I got used to that within the next couple days too. I was really down for a few days, feeling lost and weird and annoyed that everything was the same. I was anxious and worried that I would just slip into the same old, boring routine. I did not want that to happen.All I dreamed about on the trail was how I wanted my life to be when I was finished. I dreamed of a fresh start. I ignited an excitement for getting started with my new, amazing life I had thought up for myself. Now, I just needed to put it into action.Step 1: I got rid of probably 60% of my clothes. Don't wear 'em. Don't need 'em! I realized that after only wearing one outfit a day for 155 or so days. (I love my dresses though...)Step 2: Throw away random crap in my room that I don't need/Get rid of pointless space-wasting knick-knacks. (Still working on this...I have a lot of random crap.)Step 3: Chop off all my hair! I've been dying for a haircut, and I finally got one! (It's not too dramatic, but it did the trick.) I feel all new now. Clipped nails, shaved legs, new haircut, and I'm ready to go! I guess I felt like I needed to look a little different to actually feel different. It's like now, I'm the girl who thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail! Whereas, before, I was just still the same me as before.Step 4: Make lists! I love making lists. I'm definitely a total list-maker. I made a list of daily goals, short-term goals, long-term goals, things I want to focus on everyday, etc. Some of these include: Positivity Mantras (such as waking up and saying what I'm grateful for every morning), Loving Myself (which includes treating myself well--sleeping enough, drinking enough water, eating well, exercising, pushing myself, healthy indulgences, etc.), and Things I Want to Do More of to mold me into the person I want to become (such as improving my photography, learning a new language, learning the ukulele, getting better at calisthenics and rock climbing, etc.) The trail still feels more like a dream than something that actually happened, but I have my pictures to remind me that it did happen. I have my friends to remind me. I have my new strengths to remind me. I have toner legs to remind me. So I know it DID happen. But, I'm feeling better. Almost two weeks later, I'm feeling better. I started school yesterday, and that was a whole new influx of crazy, but I survived. With the thousands of people crowding the campus, I definitely felt like I wanted to go crawl back into the serenity of the woods, but then I remembered, people-watching is fun.So Step 5: I made tentative schedules for the days. I agreed to start going to the gym with my mom at 5am every morning...which if you've read my blog previously, you'll know 5am is a BIT of a stretch...but I figure if I go with her, then I'm giving her a gym buddy, which will help her to be happier and healthier while making me get my butt out of bed earlier, which will hopefully make the rest of my day more productive. (Also, gym buddies are always great and will help keep you going!) The rest of the day is pretty flexible besides classes, so I hope to remember to be mindful about how I spend my time, especially when it comes to watching tv. It's definitely a comfort, but I'd rather be doing something else (the majority of the time), and I just need to remember that and practice that.Anyway, so that's that. Sorry if it was long winded. Again, I appreciate all the amazing encouragement, positivity, and support that I've received through trail journals. I did not expect that when I started blogging on here.

My sister and I were sitting in the warm laundry room, reading our books and munching on banana chips--it was bliss. Later, in the shelter, I bonded with a fellow thru-hiker named Sweets. At the time, I didn't know that she would become one of my closest friends on the trail, and I would later summit Katahdin with her and five other members of my ""trail family."" 
Today, my boyfriend Gary is en route to Georgia (from Massachusetts) to start his own Appalachian Trail journey, and I couldn't be more excited for him. I find myself reminiscing about those wonderful days on the trail. I miss it. I miss the trail so much. I miss my trail family. I miss the lifestyle. I miss the freedom. I miss the trials.
After I finished my thru-hike of the Appalachian trail, I went right back to my senior year of college. It was surreal. I was back at home, going to school, and working at my ordinary job. To be honest, it was hard. Really hard. Thankfully, I met Gary only a couple short months after getting back from the trail. He has been there for me through my post-trail/post-college struggles, and I have been there for him through his family's ups and downs. Before I had even graduated college, I had started my new job as a sales representative for Down the Road Beer Co., a wonderful independent brewing company based out of Everett, MA. That summer as a sales representative could not have been more opposite to what I had been doing the summer before. I was in a car all day, every day. It damn-near ruined me. I barely ate, I drank a lot of beer (and don't get me wrong, it was delicious beer!), I never exercised, and I barely saw the sun. I have never been more depressed in my life. I went from major transition to major transition--from the AT, back to senior year of college, to starting a serious relationship, to starting my first ""real"" job as a sales representative, to moving in with my boyfriend and his family, to leaving that job at Down the Road Beer, to starting a new career as a teacher! Talk about a roller coaster of major transitions all within about a ONE YEAR period. 
I finally feel like things are starting to turn around again for the better. I have a challenging and rewarding job that I love, time to do the things that I love, and a man who I love about to hike the trail that I love! Though Gary had been dreaming of an AT thru-hike for about 15 years, his actual choice of going now was very last minute (like he decided two weeks beforehand last minute). The ways that our two families came together to help him go really touched my heart. With my family's AT experience (Bombadil, Goldberry, Verge, and I all hiked the AT in 2016) and Gary's family's inside knowledge on how to calm his nerves, we made a good send-off team. I will miss him like crazy, but #perksofbeingateacher, I get the summer off! Come June, ""Legs"" will be back on the trail and by my honey's side (whatever his trail name might be!) Good luck Gary! I know you'll have an amazing experience.",,View Entry,"Apr 06, Fri",0
