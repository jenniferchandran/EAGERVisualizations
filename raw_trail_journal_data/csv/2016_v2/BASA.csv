BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531664,"Hello,After finishing the Grand Enchantment Trail last year, I was so homesick that I decided I was done thru hiking! A week after I made this decision, which nobody that knew me actually believed, I began to dream every night about hiking. This dreaming went on for about a month then one night I had a vivid vision where my wife told me to go hike. I woke up knowing that I was going to hike the Appalachian Trail. So when I told my wife, Cyndi, of this big revelation that I was going on another thru hike she reacted with no surprise. In fact, she really had no reaction to my big news other than look at me as if I was a child. Her reaction was pretty much the same reaction I got from all my family and close friends when I told them of my intention to hike the AT.Hiking the AT! Well I'm excited!",,"Novato, CA","May 06, Fri",0
BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532189,"I started preparing physically for this hike in October making sure I hiked at least once sometime during the day regardless of how tired I was from work or other activities. In January, I took a leave of absence from work and started hiking twice a day. As part of my preparation I've also gone on a few overnight backpacking trips. I'm not concerned about how I'll adapt to living on the trail, I've gone on some type of thru hike every year since 2012 so living on the trail is part of my life.Preparing specifically for the AT I have purchased topographic maps, Guthook's GPS application for my smart phone, Appalachian Trail Thru-Hikers Companion guide, and I joined the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. I've also followed the forum discussions on White Blaze, followed numerous trail journals, and watched a lot of Utube videos. I've talked to a few hiker friends that have hiked the AT. My hiker friends have assured me that a May start will not be a problem for me. Part of my preparation has also been a few gear purchases. I've upgraded my shelter from a poncho tarp to a tent tarp from Tarptent to keep my contact with rodents to a minimum, I hate mice crawling over me while I sleep! Another upgrade is a new sleeping pad. Besides those two items the rest of the gear I need for the hike is stuff I already own. In fact, I own at least two or three different types of each backpacking item so I have to decide between them. For this hike I've decided on the lightest of my items such as my 40 degree sleeping bag, my ion black diamond headlamp,Gerber dime knife, and Leki microvario poles. I'm leaving my gloves, balaclava, and beanie at home because the temperatures should be warm. I'll be going stoveless and treating my water with Aqua Mira. No stove, no fuel, no pots and pans, and no water filter means I'll be traveling an average of 4 lbs lighter then most thru hikers. The base weight of all my gear is 12.2 lbs. this includes a few luxury items such as my smart phone and a lot of hygiene items.I will not be getting resupplied from home, I'll be using a bounce box. As far as planning how much mileage I'll do each day, where I will stop, and take zeroes (days off) I don't bother figuring that out any more until I'm out on the trail. Oh and one other thing I will have to get use to is not having the family and friend support I've gotten on the West Coast. On the AT I'll actually have to take care of myself!",,Novato,"May 08, Sun",0
BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532373,"My wife and I get up at 3 am and we are on the road 15 minutes later. An hour later my wife drops me off at SFO airport. Needless to say my wife is absolutely wonderful. The hardest part of my upcoming hike is going to be me being away from her. Now for her she's probably going to enjoy her time away from me. Ha ha.Two hour flight from San Francisco to Phoenix then after an hour lay over I'm in the air again going to Atlanta. I want to sleep, I can't I'm too excited. This flight lasts three hours.Landed in Atlanta, 30 minutes later I'm on a train to North Springs. 40 minutes on the train, I walk off the train looking for my shuttle driver. My shuttle driver has an SUV, I throw my pack in the back and were off. I tell him I need to stop at a grocery store for supplies. He says he doesn't have time because he has another run. I promise him it will take less than 10 minutes, he grudgingly stops at a small market. Five minutes later I'm back in the SUV with four days of hiking food. The shuttle driver is in disbelief. He now understands I know what I'm doing he becomes more friendly. We arrive at the hostel in Dahlonega, Georgia, it is 6:30 PM. I'm done traveling for the day. Well enough of this easy transportation tomorrow I walk!",,"Dahlonega, Georgia","May 10, Tue",0
BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532974,"After breakfast at the Hostel, the owner of the hostel, Josh loaded me and four other hikers in a van to take us to start our hikes. The four other hikers wanted to start at Springer Mountain while I wanted to do the approach trail. So we took the four to Springer then Josh drove me to the approach trail.At the ranger station at Amicola Falls I weighed my pack now fully weighted with 4 days of food and two liters of water. It weighed 23 lbs.I started hiking the approach trail at 11 am. Falls were beautiful. So glad I didn't let other hikers talk me out of hiking it. The approach trail adds an extra eight miles to the hike that is not counted as official AT miles. My philosophy is eight miles to see something special, no problem.I'm at the top of Springer Mountain at 2 PM. I signed the register and had my picture taken. At 6 PM, I was at Hawk Mountain tent site. These are new tent sites established this year. Only two other hikers for the 30 sites.One of the other hikers that was with me in the van this morning, she was dropped off at Springer Mountain, I passed her when she was about two miles from the tent site. She was having a difficult time, she had only covered six miles in five hours. It took her about two hours to cover the final two miles to the tent site. When she arrived at the tent site she was exhausted. She asked me where the water was. I told her it was a 1/4 mile down the hill. She said, ""Oh no."" I thought she was going to cry. Oh well, I didn't want that so I gave her my two liters of water and I went back down to the spring to get two more liters. I hate to be judgmental but she is not going to make it. I couldn't bring myself to tell her to quit. I admire the human spirit it is so amazing though it can get you in trouble. It has to be so heartbreaking to plan and make arrangements for a hike that will take four to six months only to find out in one or two days it won't be possible for you.For me it was an easy day, no soreness, and no blisters. I'm so happy to be hiking. Today was a beautiful day. For some reason when I started hiking today I was nervous, I had butterflies in my stomach. ""Easy by easy,"" I reminded myself throughout the day. Today I covered 17 miles including the approach trail. I need to average 17 miles a day to reach Katahdin by October 1.Hiker tips: I try not to overdue it my first day. You can gather a lot of intel at hostels, some of it pertinent and some of it not. The main lesson I learned at this hostel was that there were a lot of injured and unprepared hikers that had already decided to quit after two or three days.","Dahlonega, Georgia

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532988,"Time change from west coast to east coast was an issue for me. I didn't fall to sleep last night until 1 am. I began hiking at 7 am. By 11 am I was at Gooch Shelter. I was exhausted, nap time. One hour later after a power nap I was ready for the hills!Hills are short and intense, straight up and down. The climbs so far have only taken about a 1/2 hour this translates to a little less than a mile and half climbs. In the west our climbs are longer and at higher altitude but not near as steep! Out west we use a thing called the switchback.Numerous rain showers today. At 4 pm., intense downpour that would not let up so I decided to call it a day. I set up camp at the crowded Lance Creek Restoration Tent Site. It was crowed with at least 20 various tents and hammocks set up. I finally found a spot after some fellow hikers said they could make room for me.I met some nice people at the campground. We had a short get together. One hiker made a pot of hot coffee and shared it with about five of us. The get together ended because of intense rain, we all had to seek refuge in our various shelters. It rained all night.Hiker tips: It is alright to hike in the rain. It gets dangerous when lightning is present and it is smart to find a place preferably mid-slope to wait the storm out. I'm not always smart and will often continue until I feel the lightning is near. Also my rule of thumb is to quit if I get cold.","Hawk Mountain Tent Site

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533142,"Got up at 6 am it was still drizzling so I packed up my tent wet. After leaving the tent site, I was greeted with an immediate uphill climb.This upward climb is called Blood Mountain. Blood Mountain has an elevation of 4,461' so I had to climb 1,400'. I would love to say I powered up it no problem. I can't say that yet, I still have some fitness work to do. So at about 3,800', I started rewarding myself after every 100' of elevation gain with a 5 breath rest. My Casio Pathfinder watch's altimeter was very useful.Atop Blood Mountain, no views were available because it was in the middle of a cloud. I made good time down the steep descent on the North side of the mountain. I arrived at Neel Gap at 10:30 am. When you arrive at Neel Gap the first thing you see is a tree with countless hiker shoes and boots hanging on the tree. These shoes and boots are thrown up into the tree by hikers that have decided to quit. Besides feeling tired from the time change and getting use to the steep inclines of the AT I'm nowhere near wanting to throw my expensive trail runners up a tree!At Neel Gap's store I bought and guzzled down two Mountain Dew sodas. I then asked if I could stay at the hostel for a couple of hours to nap and charge my phone. So for $10 the hostel was all mine! All the previous day's hikers had left and the Neel's Gap store staff had just finished cleaning it for today's round of incoming hikers.I power napped for an hour then wrote two journal entries with my now fully charged phone. I went back to the store and saw several hikers that I met yesterday at Lance Creek. They had just arrived and were devouring Dejoirno's pizzas. I said good by and began hiking. Once again it was uphill but after about a 1/2 hour the trail leveled out and I enjoyed ridge running (hiking at same elevation on side of a mountain) for about 3 hours. One final uphill then a long downhill to Low Gap where I camped.Over the last three days if I had so desired to collect abandoned backpacker items on the side of the trail, I would have accumulated a tent, tarp, chair, and a sleeping pad. This is evidence of backpackers having to much weight on their backs. Hike light and be safe!Hiker tip: Get hiker fit before you thru hike; this means hike, preferably with a pack.","Lance Creek Restoration Tent Site0

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533241,"On the trail at 7 am. Once again I started with uphill climb though it began with a gentle upgrade. Hiking was fairy easy even though I climbed 1,000' to top of Blue Mountain. Once at the top of the mountain I began going downhill for the most part. On the way down I passed a few thru hikers, a troop of boyscouts, and numerous weekend hikers since today is Saturday. Weekends on the AT become very busy I've been told. Today was evidence that it is.At 10:45 am, I was at Unicol Gap where GA 75 intersects with the trail. Called a motel in Hiawassee and I arranged for a shuttle driver to pick me up. So 30 minutes later with $15 less in my pocket I was in a Budget Motel in Hiawassee, Georgia.Immediately after getting a room, I jumped into the shower then power napped for two hours. I then got up to do my Hiker chores.I did my wash at the motel coin laundry. I did two journal entries during the two hours it took to do laundry.Then I went to an R&B for a late lunch having a pulled pork sandwich. Then to Ingle's grocery store for resupply. Besides food, I bought some allergy medicine to deal with my constant sneezing and itching eyes on the trail. After the grocery store, my final stop was a Subway deli where I bought a foot long sandwich for tomorrow Trail meals.After finishing all my errands. I caught up on Trail news with a hiker named Bo he told me of an incident where a hiker got biten in the leg by a bear. This happened like yesterday in the Smokey Mountains!Another young hiker named Matt stopped by my room and we talked a while about hiking.I got phone calls to family in. Had pizza delivered to my room for a late dinner. Tomorrow I'm ready to go!Hiker tip: To get a ride to town you have several options such as hitchhiking, arranging a shuttle through a hotel or hostel,or calling an independent shuttle operator. Sometimes a bus ride is available at busy trailheads.","Low Gap Shelter (Tent sites above)

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533665,"I shared a shuttle with Bo, Pappy, and Mathew to the Unicol Gap trail head from the Budget Motel. Pappy gave me a weather report of clear skies for the next three days on the trail based on the AT weather site.Back on the trail I began an uphill climb.After about 6 miles I ran across two hikers, Cog and Grant, I had previously met voth of them but at separate times. I talked to both of them then took off.After about 5 minutes I noticed Grant behind me. It appeared I had a hiking partner. Grant is a college cross country runner. We made it to Plumorchid Gap Shelter and set up our tents.Hiker tips: Don't worry about hiking alone on AT it is hard to do somebody will want to hike with you. When beginning a hike from a trail head the majority of the time you will be headed uphill since most trail heads are at low points such as valleys or low passes.","Unicol Gap

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533668,"We began hiking at 8 am. We left the state of Georgia and we hiked into the state of North Carolina about 10 am. One state is now in the books with 13 more to go! Grant asked me to give him a trail name. After much thought I came across a name I thought fit him, ""Achilles."" He liked it.We made it to Carter Gap Shelter to end the day. No bear bag cables were located at the campground so I taught Achilles the way you had to hang bags in Yosemite before they started requiring bear canisters. I taught him the counter balance method using two food bags roughly of equal weight. Next I'll teach him how to do it with one bag and a caribeaner. I went to sleep fast.Hiker tip: Stop to eat dinner an hour before you stop to set up your night's campsite this will reduce food odors that will attract unwanted visitors (bears).Hiker tips: It is nice to know several different ways to hang your food. It is amazing to see so many food bags hung right next to the trunk of the tree or above or next to a tent.","Plumorchard Gap Shelter

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533698,"It rained hard last night! Pappy was one day off in his forecast. It was still raining hard when I got up at 5:45 am and it looked like it was not going to let up. I forced myself to get up and get dressed and get my rain jacket on. I then went out in the dark with rain pouring to get our food bags. It took me awhile to find them in the dark. Somebody else hung their bag on the same branch bringing our bags closer to the ground then I prefer. I then took Achilles' food bag to him and woke him up so he could get ready.At 6:30 am it was still pouring so I decided to wait until 8am to start hiking on the reasoning that even though it would still be raining it would be a warmer rain.I dosed off in my tent ready to go with everything packed except the tent itself. I awoke at 7:45 then packed up the wet tent and started walking.Even though it was raining hard we made good time on the wet muddy trail. We climbed the slick wet rocks of Mt. Albert encountering no problems. At the top of the mountain we ate snacks and celebrated that we not only summited but we were at the 100 mile mark of the AT.We made great time to Rock Gap where we met Ron Haven, the owner of the hotel that we would be staying at.On the ride to the hotel Ron told us it would be at least 100 trail miles to the next good supply town. So in Franklin we shopped for 5 days of food. I still have no physical problems and I am enjoying the trail.Hiker tips: In town first thing I like to do is wash my clothes and shower this makes me feel instantly better. Then next thing I like to do is get a good meal in me then I shop for supplies. If it is 4 days to the next town I need 11 meals figuring I'll eat breakfast in town. I usually buy a deli sandwich for my lunch and dinner the first day. Frozen burritos, pre-cooked bacon, salami, cheese, peanut butter, and tortillas are some of my staples.Hiker tip: By eating breakfast in town and buying a foot long Subway sandwich my first day of food is taken care of on departure from town.","Carter Gap Shelter
",Rock Gap,"May 17, Tue",12.90
BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534529,"We had a good breakfast at Country Kitchen. We were there right when they opened their doors at 6 am. By the time we left the restaurant there were eight other hikers there eating breakfast.Ron Haven the motel owner gave us and six other hikers a ride back to the Rock Gap trail head. We started hiking at 9:45 am.We had a 3,000' climb to get to a beautiful stone observation tower on Wayah Bald. Best view for us so far.This is day 1 of an estimated 5 days before our next resupply stop. We need to average approximately 20 miles a day to resupply in Gatlinburg, Tennessee.We met our first day goal and found a beautiful bluff to camp on. The unofficial campsite was a good choice for us. We slept well.Hiker tips: When hiking with another hiker it helps to have a few ground rules so you don't get separated from one another. One guideline is to wait for one another at trail intersections, top of mountains, and have an agreed upon lunch meeting time where the lead hiker stops and waits for the other hiker.","Rock Gap
",Mile 127 unofficial campsite ,"May 18, Wed",20.90
BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534534,"Another day, another observation tower for us to appreciate. After our usual morning climb, we came upon the Wesser Bald Observation Tower. At the top of the stairs to the tower, I was met by a wolf dog growling at me. He was guarding three sleeping hikers. He warmed up to me but he kept a close watch on Achilles who he continued to growl at. Once the wolf settled down we enjoyed a beautiful morning's view of the surrounding mountains.After the usual ups and downs we made it to Nantahala Outdoor Center at noon. We had lunch there at a reasonable price. We found out the hard way not to buy at the small grocery store where one bottle of Gatorade costs $3.00.Big big climb out of NOC after 2 hour break. 3300' climb to Cheoah Bald. I felt it was the hardest climb for me yet. View looking to the east from Cheoah Bald was awesome. No one knows why these peaks are bald at the top there are a lot of different theories. We finally had some downhill hiking to our campsite located at Locust Cove Gap. We hung our food bags, for the second night in a row, using the counter balance method.Hiker tips: Hiker was bitten in his leg by a bear while he was asleep in his tent this week in the Smokey Mountains. Hikers should not sleep wearing suntan lotion or other scents that can be taken for food. Rumor is that hiker's suntan lotion had the scent of coconut. If available use bear bag cables and bear proof storage lockers provided at campgrounds and shelters to store your food. If you're comfortable with the weight carry a bear canister for carrying and storing your food. I personally prefer the counter balance method for two bags. For a one bag hang, I use the counter balance method modified with the use of a carabiner with a stick. I feel the popular method of hanging a bag with a rope over a limb and tying the other end of the rope to the base of a tree is not the best way to keep food from bears. But HYOH.","Mile 127 unofficial campsite

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534535,"Achilles and I got after it today. We took no prisoners, not letting the rain slow us down. We made it to Fontana Dam at 4 pm. After a dinner of junk food from the visitor center we decided to go for it and go into the Smokey Mountains. Other thru hikers, that we did not know, looked at us like we were idiots (high probability we are) as we walked across the dam in the pouring rain.We hiked uphill in a torrential down pour only seeing big frogs and salamanders on the trail. We finally made it to a tent site. We set up our tents in the rain with a strong wind gusting. Fortunately the tent site had bear cables so we didn't have to worry about finding a tree to hang our food. I climbed into my tarp tent and got my wet clothes off. I climbed into my sleeping bag and put dry clothes on. I went to sleep with rain pounding on my tarp tent.Hiker tips: I don't have a problem hiking in the rain as long as lightning isn't present or there is not a danger of high winds bringing down trees. When I do hike in the rain my stop point is if I begin to shiver, at this point I immediately stop and set up shelter then get my wet clothes off and crawl into my sleeping bag. HYOH","Locust Cove

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534537,We woke up to pouring rain. We decided to wait for a break in the weather so we hunkered down in our tents. At 10 am we took off with our wet tents and with our only remaining set of dry clothes on. The plan today was to make it to a shelter to spend the night since we wanted to avoid using our wet tents. It is also a requirement in the Smoky Mountains to sleep in a shelter if shelter space is available.Going today was slow because of the rain. We had to stop once and go into a shelter at lunch time so Achilles could warm up. He is still learning so I have to keep my on him as far as him being aware of signs of hypothermia and dehydration. We reached the Derrick Knob Shelter at 7 pm. There were 10 people in the shelter including us. The shelter had tarps hung on the open side of the shelter to keep out the wind. A small fire was going in the shelter fireplace which was nice. Achilles enjoyed the shelter experience and the social aspect of it. I prefer my tarp tent. It rained hard that night changing my viewpoint on shelters slightly. I was grateful that no one snored loud or that I was awakened by mice as a fellow bunk mate that night was.Hiker tips: Don't be hesitant to tell fellow hikers not to eat or store their food in the shelter. Have hand sanitizer and use it often in the shelter environment unfortunately norovirus is a big problem in shelters. Sleep on top floor.

A couple days ago I thought I had my trail legs but today and yesterday say it ain't so.We woke up with wind howling and rain pouring. Once again, we had to wait to hike until rain and wind died down. Finally once again the weather settled down at 10 am. At least Achilles and I thought it did but the other hikers in the shelter stayed put and watched us go off into the rain and wind.We slogged through the mud on a mostly uphill climb towards Clingmans Dome. After about 5 miles going uphill I checked my phone and I had service at this point. I had Achilles call his parents. His parents were worried because they hadn't heard from him in two days. Unfortunately the phone situation will happen again I'm sure so it is kind of a good thing to happen early in the trip.We reached Clingmans Dome, the highest point on the Appalachian Trail at 6,643'.We thought we had it made thinking we would have all downhill the rest of the day but after a steep descent we had another steep climb up Love Mountain at 6,446'. Finally we had all downhill to Newfound Gap.We hiked the last 2 miles with a hiker named Brave Foot who hiked the AT in 2006. He now section hikes the AT every year.At Newfound Gap we were officially in Tennessee. We got a ride to Gatlinburg from a couple on my first ask. It was Achilles first hitch! I guess I'm a bad influence. Anyway Justin and Jordan, our ride givers, were generous giving us water, cheese, and crackers on our ride to Gatlinburg. We checked into a motel.

First thing we did was get a new room at the Travel Lodge. It cost us a night's fee since we had paid for two nights at the Grand Marquis. Still it was worth losing money to not stay there another night.Usual town chores. We found an awesome small outfitters not listed in the guide books called the Day Hiker. It had awesome prices. I bought a hiking shirt for $16 that you usually couldn't get for less than $50.Achilles parents and his twin brother Grayson came and took us out to dinner and then to a store to resupply. They treated me very well, Thank you.Travel Lodge a definite upgrade, we slept well.Hiker Tip: Don't always go by recommendation of past thru hikers on where to stay especially if recommendation is based on an experience long ago.

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535240,"Started day with a big country breakfast I then had a good laugh at Achilles expense when we began our hitch out of town. I told him to stick his thumb out for a ride, he then proceeded to give passing cars the thumbs up sign, I guess telling them they were all right. Ha ha. I then showed him the proper procedure of putting your thumb sideways and looking towards the vehicle. We got a ride immediately from a kind couple who went 20 miles out of their way to give us a ride to the Newfound Trailhead.Hiking was great today with expansive vistas of the surrounding mountains. After an initial climb we hiked on the ridge of the mountain range. The highlight of the day was Charlie's Bunion. I got Achilles to go out on a rock for a picture, he is afraid of heights. I scrambled up and down the rocks including the high point. Another older cautious hiker commented that I was nuts. I responded back that I had made my living being nuts and climbing ladders. We ended the day at Cosby Knob Shelter. We had to stay at the shelter because it is required in the Smokey Mountains.Hiker tips: Often side trips on a blue blaze trail will offer the hiker the best vistas and challenges. Many purists avoid blue blazes. My rule of thumb I use for myself is that if I decide to use a blue blaze and it adds extra miles to my day's hike I won't back track. If the blue blaze cuts AT mileage then I'll backtrack. Either way I add mileage. I'm not a purist and I won't see every white blaze. By the end of this trail I will hike more mileage, that won't be documented, and see more sights then a purist. HYOH","Gatlinburg, Tennessee

I was a little jealous when I saw a tent atop it knowing the occupants must have seen a beautiful sunset last night.Another beautiful day though the humidity was felt by this west coast boy! We ended the day in Hot Springs, North Carolina. The AT runs right through the middle of town. We got a room at a local motel. As of late we've avoided hostels because of rumors of norovirus being prevalent at those establishments. Hikers are dirty, myself included.After getting settled in our room. Achilles and I went to the local tavern and ate and listened to a two person band that played some authentic blues. They were called the ""Night Shirts."" After dinner we called it a night.Hiker tip: Carry hand sanitizer, use it. Hikers are generous and will often offer you food. Politely refuse the food if other people's hands have touched it. Wrapped gifts like a Snickers bar though are fine. One final thing on being sanitary, on the trail people fist bump instead of shake hands when they greet each other and say goodbye. HYOH","Brown Gap

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535615,We went for a big country style breakfast at the Smokey Mountain Diner. I had the skillet breakfast and I couldn't eat it all. Achilles had waffles and almost succeeded in eating the seven huge waffles on his plate. Another great thing about this restaurant was the artwork on the wall most of it Appalachian Trail related. After breakfast we resupplied at the Dollar General Store. Then we set on a bench in front of the library where I used their wi-fi to make some journal entries. We then went to the Hot Springs Resort.At the resort we sat in a hot tub for an hour. This was great. Achiness and soreness from my muscles disappeared. I was ready to hike.We left Hot Springs at 11:30 am. We crossed the French Broad River by bridge then following its northern bank before we started uphill. I moved well covering ground fast until the rain started falling hard and fast. I waited for Achilles who was having a slow day after having a wonderful day hiking yesterday. We stopped quickly at a shelter to treat our water. The shelter was filled with hikers not willing to hike in the rain.The hikers warned us that the next shelter was more than 8 miles away. We wished them well ignored their warnings and continued on. Shortly after leaving the shelter the rain stopped.At 8 pm we arrived at Little Laurel Shelter and found nice tent sites nearby. We set up our tents and ate dinner. We hung our food bags on the provided bear cables. I fell asleep fast.Hiker tip: I don't worry to much about getting wet in the rain as long as I have a set of dry clothes to wear when I stop. I also do not use a rain cover for my pack.

The big climb today was up Big Butt Mountain.5 minutes late we met Ray at Devil's Fork Gap. He was laying under a tree as relaxed as he could be. We joined him under the tree enjoying the sodas he brought. Then as we sat a car pulled up and a man gave us homemade cheese and crackers. The cheese, a spreadable type, was delicious.After an hour break we began hiking mostly uphill. I brought up the rear of our hiking trio. Ray is a strong hiker, he did not slow us down.About 8 pm we set up camp by a small stream. I had difficulty finding a tree limb that could support the weight of three food bags. I broke a huge limb of a dead snag with the weight of our bags that I guessed wrong on. Finally I found the right branch and hung our food. Side note is I'm usually the one to hang the food because of my expertise at throwing rocks.We covered some good ground today, I slept well.Hiker tip: Parachute cord is the rope of choice for most hikers when hanging food bags. Parachute cord also has many other uses that include using as a clothes line, shoe laces, guy lines for tents and tarps, flagging, belt, and it can be used as a safety line when fording streams.","Little Laurel Shelter

We hiked well starting with a steep uphill ascent towards Big Bald. It was a 7 mile climb. After a valiant effort, Ray slowed down about two miles from the top. Achilles slowed down to hike with his dad. I took the lead and powered up the final two miles feeling great.At the top of Big Bald, I took off my pack and enjoyed the view. I had a conversation with a day hiker and found out that a parking lot was close by making Big Bald accessible to anyone. Once Achilles and Ray arrived we sat and ate.Next was an easy ascent of Little Bald. Then some downhill and then a climb up to High Rocks. I waited at a trail junction for Achilles and Ray. At this junction was a route to the top of High Rocks. I persuaded Ray and Achilles to take the blue blaze to see High Rocks. Ray regretted this choice because it involved very steep climbing. At the top we joined 6 other hikers in enjoying the view. I joked with Ray that he would thank me in about 2 months for taking him up there once his memory of the pain of climbing subsided.Two miles later we're at Spivey Gap. We hired a shuttle driver from Uncle Johnny's Hostel to take us to Ray's car. Ray drove us to a nice hotel in Irving, Tennessee. I got my own room and fell asleep immediately.I woke up at 6 pm. We had dinner at an Italian Restaurant. Pasta was exactly what I needed. After dinner we did laundry and resupplied.

After breakfast Ray gave Achilles and I a ride back to Spivey Gap. We began hiking at 8:30 am.The hike back into Irving was some of the easiest hiking on the AT so far.

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536611,"Today we hiked under the threat of rain all day. We seemed to be at the edge of a rain storm always seeing in front of us dark clouds and hearing the thunder. Fortunately we never gained distance on the dark clouds, we kept the same pace as the clouds as we traveled north. We saw evidence of the rain by hiking through the puddles and mud caused by rain.Roan Mountain where the storm seemed to be centered was a challenge as it consisted of two steep climbs. The lower ascent was the steepest. The final ascent was more gradual but exhausting still after the lower ascent took its toll.dOnce we reached the top of Roan Mountain, over 6'000 ' high, we were greeted by a sea of yellow flowers called Golden Ragwort in an expansive field. We were also greeted by three aggressive dogs that couldn't be controlled by their owner, who was camping on the field. Fortunately my experience with trekking poles made the dogs back off. A short while after our dog encounter, we came upon High Knob Shelter, the highest shelter on the AT. The hikers already there were complaining about hiking in the rain all day. There was a clothes line in front of the shelter filled with wet clothes. I felt lucky that I missed the rain.Achilles and I set up our tents a short way away from the shelter. As usual we hung our food bags and went to bed at 9 pm.We are running into more experienced hikers on the trail. As compared to our first couple weeks on the trail there are more hikers that are thu hiking and covering more mileage daily.Hiking tips: Easiest hiking is in the morning and evening when temperature is cool and the Sun isn't beating on you. It seems to me that it's just making it hard on oneself to sleep in until 10 begin hiking at 11 and quit at 4. You are hiking the hottest part of the day. Trekking poles are a great defense against aggressive animals, hold one of the poles high over your head and point the other pole towards the animal. I have used my trekking pole defense in encounters with bulls, mountain lions, and dogs with great success. You can use the pole you point to stab or shove, the pole above your head you can use to hammer or throw.","Beauty Spot Gap

I felt I was on the verge of heat exhaustion. I went through 2 liters of water in a 3 1/2 mile span. Once I reached the top I was completely out of water.

At home I watch every game on TV. On the trail I can't watch the games but sometimes I can follow the play by play on my smart phone.Last night was the first game of NBA finals. Well I over indulged in following the game and I ran my phone dead. I got little sleep going to bed at midnight when the game finished. The Warriors did win!So I woke up with no water, very tired, and a dead phone. My salvation that morning was hope that a bathroom at Shook Branch Recreation Area, on the edge of Watauga Lake, had an outlet for charging my phone. If no electrical outlet was available we'd have to hitch to Hampton.Well the bathroom had an outlet and running water. An hour later we had our phones charged.A lot of our hike in the morning went around Lake Watauga and then across the dam. After the dam we once again climbed.

We are now in our 4th state of the trail. By 2 pm we were in Damascus.In Damascus we decided to stay at the Woodchuck Hostel. I took a shower, put on some loaner clothes and I did my wash. Wow did I feel better! Six days without me taking a shower was too long especially with the humidity of the South. I thought I often smelled ripe on the Pacific Coast Trail but on the Appalachian Trail I've taken offensive body smell to a whole new level.After our clothes were done, Achilles and I got a ride from Woodchuck to Bo-Bos for dinner. I then got some new trail runners from an outfitter. The first outfitter I went to only had boots and tried to convince me trail runners weren't appropriate for hiking. ""Shut up!,"" I wanted to say. I've hiked close to 10,000 miles in trail runners and about 1,000 in boots and for me it isn't even close what I prefer. I exited the store politely and went to the outfitters literally next door. At the next outfitters they didn't have my size in two name brands that I was familiar with so I went with a brand called ""Salewa."" The shoe was expensive at $140 but the tread was aggressive and it has Kevlar shoe strings, a high tech shoe. I took a size 12. I'm becoming a hobbit as I become older, my feet are getting bigger and I'm getting shorter.Well back at the hostel, fortunately all my roommates were quiet sleepers. I slept well.Hiker tip: Buy shoes one size too big so when your feet swell the shoes remain comfortable.

During that time Options and the eight hikers passed us.After our break we began to hike at a good pace. Our primary goal was to reach the Mount Rogers Visitor Center by 12:30 am. Our secondary goal for fun was to catch all the hikers that passed us during our break. We had 5 miles to do it. Within one mile we caught one hiker.

We finally caught Mogley, the hiker going for 34 miles that day, at a stream filtering water. He began hiking with us.We started going up a hill and I pushed it not letting up yet I felt uncomfortable feeling like I would have to relent and slow up eventually. I resisted the urge to slow up and just took it one step at a time. I kept this up for about about a half hour until the fast pace finally felt comfortable. As we neared the top of the mountain I began jogging. We covered the next 13 miles in 3 hours, a pace of over 4 mph.

He asked, ""Where?"" I pointed directly downhill to a leafy, bushy, and slanted area that probably had never been used as a campsite before. Achilles looked at me, like are you sure? Yes I was sure, it was off the ridge and it was into the brush. We made it work setting up our tents while getting drenched in a torrential downpour. Achilles was in his tent first. As I was driving in my last tent stake a flash of light again right over my head followed a second later by a loud boom, wow! I let out my frightened yelp that I'm prone to do when startled.

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539113,"We had the hotel's breakfast and were on the trail by 9 am. We really had an uneventful day, everything went as planned and we were done hiking by 5:30 pm.This was the first time we ever arrived at a shelter before other hikers arrived. In a short while 5 other hikers arrived with only one hiker sleeping in the shelter. The rest of us tented. Slept well.Hiker tip: The longer you hike the more likely that tenting spots at shelters will be limited. Many hikers quit at 4 or 5 pm just so they can get a good spot at a shelter. If no spot is available I'll find a stealth spot near by. A stealth spot that is often available is the trail junction where the trail leaves the AT to go to the shelter.","Daleville

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539119,"Today we came upon an interesting rock formation called the Guillotine where a rock is suspended over the trail. I scrambled onto the rock. It actually looked like the rock could be jarred loose. I didn't try.Near end of day we saw a trail crew coming into a parking lot. The crew leader gave Achilles and I each a banana, apple, and orange. We also met a Ridge Runner called Wood Elf. Ridge Runners work for the Appalachian Trail Conservancy to help hikers and teach them ""Leave no Trace"" principles. He was the first ridge runner I had seen.We set up camp at Marble Springs. A big campsite where unfortunately several loud inconsiderate hikers decided to camp. They stayed up to 11 pm and then left the fire they started unattended. After they went to bed I still couldn't get to sleep. I slept only two hours.Hiker Tip: It is a good practice to thank trail maintenance workers, ridge runners, rangers, and other people who help keep the trail operational. Also think about how your actions such as partying late effect other hikers.","Cove Mountain Shelter

On the other side we ran into Wood Elf, the ridge runner, again.We took our first break at Matt's Creek Shelter where I tried to nap. I was unsuccessful. We then started a long climb up Bluff Mountain. It was hot and the mountain was steep. I sweated like an open faucet unable to replace fluids as quickly as I lost them. I was slow. We finally took an hour break at Punch Bowl Shelter where I thought I recovered.I was wrong because on the smaller climb up Rice Mountain I continued to sweat profusely and I began to dry heave. I was unable to drink water because I couldn't keep it down. Luckily Achilles kept his eye on me. We decided to ditch our plan of making it to Brown Mountain Creek Shelter and found an unofficial campsite. I was really dehydrated, exhausted, and nauseous. I could barely set up my tent. Achilles helped get my things in order so I crawled in my tent. Another hiker named Gem gave me some anti nausea med. I didn't eat, in fact I only had one meal all day. I had a headache all night and slept miserably. I was told it was 97 degrees Fahrenheit today. Too hot!

We decided we needed a day off. We would only have to hike 4 1/2 miles.The 4 1/2 miles for me was tough. I sweated once again profusely and tired easily especially uphill. We made it to the highway where we got a ride to Buena Vista.In town I drank so much fluid and finally regained my appetite. I feel right again. This heat though has me scared hopefully I will handle it better tomorrow. Also hopefully the day of rest has helped Achilles ankle. Tomorrow will be a short day because we have to stop in the small town of Montebello for mail. Perfect I need to ease back into hiking especially since temperature is suppose to be in nineties tomorrow.Hiker tip: You can lose track of the day of the week out on the trail. If you have a mail drop you need to plan on when you arrive because post offices are closed on Sunday and the smaller post offices usually have limited hours especially on Saturday. I have seen many hikers spend extra days on the trail because of poor planning on picking up their mail drop. This is one of the reasons I minimize my use of mail drops. Tommorow is Thursday but the post office in Montebello closes at 2 pm so we will have a short day tomorrow.,"Mile 801.6

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539587,"I slept well. I felt much better physically but I felt some depression about hiking. I reminded myself that this was normal for me at this point in a thru hike. I start getting bored and homesick at the same time.At 8:30 our shuttle driver, Piney, showed up. Achilles, Eagle Eye, and I climbed in his car. Eagle Eye, a school teacher in South Carolina, is a section hiker we met a couple days ago. Piney has shuttled hikers for over twenty years.Piney dropped us off at U.S. Route 60 trailhead. We started uphill as usual. We reached Bald Knob, Cole Mountain, and Cole Mountain Bald in succession all had nice views. We eventually reached Spy Rock Road which we detoured down 2 1/2 blue blaze miles to reach the community of Montebello. We had to go to Montebello to pick up mail from the post office. I had to pickup a new credit card since my number was stolen somewhere on the trail (probably Gatlinburg) and Achilles had to pickup a care package from his family. We got to Montebello at 3:30 pm too late for the Post Office that closed at 2 pm.We ended up buying soda at the store and sitting on the porch of the store talking to the locals. From the locals we got the forecasted weather for the night that was not good. The forecast was heavy rain accompanied with thunder and lightning.Across from the store was a nice private campground where we paid for a tent site. As we set up our tents nearby three families tore down their tents. One guy with that group, a recently retired Navy Veteran, told us they were leaving to avoid the storm. He generously gave us firewood and bottled water.We had our first campfire and enjoyed it immensely because of the relief it gave us from the bugs. After the fire died down we went to bed. The storm hit with a vengeance. Once again my Protrail by Tarptent was up to the task!Hiker tip: Being social with campers at public camp sites is not only a polite thing to do it usually results in food, beverages, and other goodies for you. You telling some thru hiker stories and answering questions is a cheap price to pay for some trail comforts.","U.S. 60

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539588,"It stormed hard all night with thunder and lightning until about 9 am in the morning. When it let up Achilles and I headed to the store for coffee and donuts. We hung out there reading their wildlife pamphlets and books waiting for the Post office to open.At 10 am the Post Office opened we were greeted by the nicest post office lady. Small Post Offices are so nice because they are not busy and really provide you with great service. Well I have a credit card again and I was able to send clothes that no longer fit home.After much discussion about the foretasted weather we decided to start hiking even with the knowledge that it would be raining. We decided to hike because lightning and thunder were not suppose to resume until 6 pm. We figured we could make Harper's Creek Shelter by then.We hiked in pouring rain until we reached Priest Shelter where we found Thor, Sketch and Snow White. I shared our weather report information with them that there was suppose to be a lull in the storm from 3 pm to 6 pm and then heavy rain with thunder and lightning. The lull came early, Achilles and I left the shelter at 2:30 pm.I physically felt good hiking. I hoped the effects of my heat exhaustion episode three days ago were behind me. At 5:30 pm we reached Harper's Creek Shelter. Achilles decided he wanted to sleep in the shelter. I set up my tent at a site close by. I don't sleep in shelters unless I'm required too.As predicted all hell broke loose at 6 pm, rain came down in buckets with lightning flashes and thunder sounding. I was dry in my Tarptent. Hiker Tip: The advantage of sleeping in a shelter is that the next morning your belongings are dry. This is not enough advantage for me to negate the snoring of other hikers combined with mice scurrying over me and my belongings while I sleep. Another hiker tip: Ask locals about weather forecasts. When you get to a store or campground ask about weather forecasts. Locals have been listening to the radio and watching TV and usually have the latest information concerning weather. They are also the most knowledgeable about local weather patterns.","Spy Rock Road (Montebello)

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539593,"I got up and broke down my tent. After I was packed I walked to the nearby shelter and awoke Achilles. As Achilles got ready, Stone Bridge and I witnessed a huge tree snap in half not to far from where my tent minutes ago was set up. The breaking of the tree made a huge sound and shook the ground.Achilles and I started hiking at 6:30 am. Shortly after we began hiking Achilles suggested we shoot for Rockfish Gap so we could go to Waynesboro. I was not to keen on the idea saying I would have to think about it. I later said we should make the decision later depending on the weather and how much progress we made by about 2 pm.That morning we had real steep uphill and downhill but what made it real difficult was the slippery wet rocks. I took a hard fall but fortunately was not hurt. We both slipped numerous times without falling.About 2 pm we decided to go for it and hike to Rockfish Gap. After we made that decision we passed two hikers Eagle Eye and Teddy. Teddy is named because she carries a huge Teddy Bear with her. After we passed them they kept pace with us hiking the remaining 9 miles to Rockfish Gap with us.At Rockfish Gap there was a vending truck where we had soda and hot dogs. Achilles and I got a hitch easily into Waynesboro by a nice man who drove us directly to a hotel. Once checked in, Achilles and I decided to walk to a restaurant to eat when the sky let loose with a torrential downpour. We stepped back into the hotel's protected walkway refusing to walk in those conditions. The power went out at the hotel. I was able to order pizza by cell phone. After the rain stopped we walked to a store to get cold drinks for the night.The room was nice and I slept well.Hiker tip: Another advantage of sleeping in a shelter during a storm is added protection from falling limbs and trees. Regardless of weather conditions it is always good practice to look overhead for dead snags or sickly trees that might fall when you are setting up camp.","Harper's Creek Shelter

I bought shoe inserts, athletic tape, and an ankle wrap.After laundry we went to hotel and packed up. After checking out we walked to a grocery store for supplies. When we finished shopping we loaded our supplies into our packs in front of the store. We were approached by a man who asked if we needed a ride back to the trail. After a short discussion he even said he would take us to the local outfitters first.We were on the trail by 11 am. We entered Shenandoah National Park. After a few steps we filled out a back country entry permit and deposited a copy in a metal box and kept another copy to present to rangers.Hike went well. We saw a black bear and more deer. We met a hiker named Raden, who hiked part of the day with us. We were going to camp near a shelter but it was too crowded so we continued on.As we neared our campsite we got a beautiful view from Treyfoot Mountain looking out over a field of shale towards the setting Sun.

We tried to hitch to a supermarket but we couldn't get a ride so we ended up walking close to two miles to get there.Once restocked though our shuttle driver arrived on time to take us back. Our driver, who we arranged a ride with last night, was a 2007 thru hiker. His trail name is Pittsburgh. He is going to hike the AT again next year, his 10 year anniversary hike. He did not charge us for the ride. He also gave us good info on what lies ahead. He warned us of the rattlesnakes and rocky trail in Pennsylvania. He dropped us off at the trail head at 10 am.My left leg is still sore though I feel it is slightly getting better. Because of my leg we kept a slow steady pace. It was slow going but we got our planned miles in. Near the end of the day I was tired and my lower left leg was throbbing.Achilles came across the occupied campsite before I did. He was talking to a guy asking him if they had room for us to camp there also. The guy said no besides they were also expecting other campers. Achilles said thanks being polite to the ungenerous camper.I should have been polite, I wasn't. It ticks me off when people monopolize campsites when campsites are hard to find especially a guy drinking coffee after he probably hiked a total of two miles from the parking lot. ""You deserve no thanks,"" I barked at the startled man as I hiked past the campsite that easily could have held five more tents. Little did I know at that time that the man did us a huge favor. Yes, we had to hike another half hour but boy was it worth it! We reached a trail junction a top of Compton Peak and we took a spur trail looking for a campsite. We not only found a campsite, we also found a rock outcropping to watch the sunset. It was the most magnificent sunset so far on the trail! It was gold in color making the surrounding landscape gold.

I thought about ending this 12 day challenge today the 10th day. I struggled to motivate myself but I prepared myself any way taping my leg and my blisters.Once underway I found Achilles also felt physically exhausted and sore. We talked about ending the challenge. We decided to wait to give our bodies a chance to warm-up and adapt to the discomfort we both felt.Day 10 of a 12 day challenge you would think we would have it made but it is like the last 6 miles of a marathon it is really when the challenge begins.I forced myself to remove negative thoughts and said to myself one step at a time, easy by easy, and my little prayer I always say when I'm physically at my limit, ""God, thanks for my strength, endurance, and determination.""By the time we reached a super steep rock climbing from Lehigh Gap up Blue Ridge Mountain. It started off with me scolding two guys I saw throwing their water bottles away into the brush. That got me angry, a good frame of mind to attack a steep climb. I actually did well climbing even with the hot sun blazing. Achilles had a more difficult time since he has a fear of heights, a fear he is overcoming but not this time.We reached the top and had some fairly easy hiking.

Achilles and I were on the trail by 5:30 am. We soon had another hiker on our heels called ""Fire Cracker."" He is twenty and from Scotland. He wants to go for the unsupported AT time record next year. He and Whiskey Priest had passed us on the trail about two weeks ago so we were surprised to see we caught up to him. He said he decided to slow down for the rest of the trail. Well we didn't slow down the next 5.5 mile moving at 3 mph over rocks. I think Achilles and I actually had another notch in our speed that we held back. Once we reached the road to Wind Gap, Achilles and I went into town and Fire Cracker continued on to Water Gap. Achilles and I were to go farther than Water Gap that day.In town we had a gas station market breakfast and I charged my phone. A nice lady gave us a ride back to trail head.Back on trail we hiked well until we reached a section of wet rocks called, ""Wolf Rocks."" Achilles slipped and fell fortunately he was not injured. After the rocks we rested at a shelter where five other hikers were. All of them except one had taken the bypass to go around Wolf Rocks. The one crazy hiker like us was a 19 year old named, ""Pine Cone.""After our break we began hiking only to have Pine Cone right behind us. The pace soon accelerated to easily be a couple notches faster than our pace with Fire Cracker. I say 4 mph definitely, the fast pace not helping my blisters but adrenaline took the pain away. So here I am racing my partner Achilles, a twenty year old, and Pine Cone, a 19 year old, in hilly rocky terrain. So what happens next? Well add a torrential downpour of rain with lightning and thunder to the situation.We didn't let up, no quarter given or taken, all three of us kept the petal to the metal for 7 miles until Water Gap.

We were not disappointed, we were proud of ourselves! The day started out miserably, we were both physically spent. After a mile we saw a beautiful sunrise at Sunfish Pond. We took a break at a camping resort where we stocked up on Gatorade and candy. Achilles and I met two other thru hikers there, ""Lumberjack and the Kid,"" very nice twenty something kids. Oh oh.Yes.

We reached a clearing where three other thru hikers were searching for the trail. I told them we all made a wrong turn. I led the group back to the trail.

We took a half mile walk along side the road to a visitor center to get Gatorade. It was well worth it as the temperature continued to climb. The climb we went up a steep ascent up Bear Mountain.

At the lake we bought hamburgers and soda from a vendor. We stayed under an awning for about two hours as the heat was unbearable in the direct sun.

We then walked over a bridge crossing the Hudson River.Once across the Hudson, a steep climb up that was hard made harder by scorching heat. I was prepared with my four bottles of Gatorade. I sweated out at least two of them.At the top we took a blue blaze to a monastery. The monastery allows hikers to sleep on a huge grass area of their athletic fields.

I woke up at about 5:30 am and the rain and wind had seemed to die down.  The paying guests were also getting up and they were greeted by about 15 thru hikers sleeping on the floor not seeming in a hurry to make room for them. I felt pressured to get going. It was my own self made pressure of feeling uncomfortable even though I was one of the few hikers that worked to stay there. In fact the two other hikers that worked with me also felt uncomfortable and were preparing to leave also.
I left the Hut first. Shortly after I left I realized it was going to be a major and dangerous challenge going over Mt. Madison. The higher I went up the mountain the harder the wind blew and the light rain felt like little daggers of needles as the drops hit my face. The trail is not a trail it is a marked route over a very steep pile of wet slippery rocks. I slipped many times cussing the rocks, wind, rain, and my worn shoes.
I reached the summit and conditions worsened. The wind blew me backwards and sideways many times. My pack often acted as a sail taking me where I didn't want to go. Thankfully there were many cairns well placed that kept me traveling the correct course. Above the treeline for about two miles I battled the wind for about two hours. A hour and a half into it I was passed by Moss Man who once ahead of me constantly looked back to see if I was okay.
I finally was below the treeline in the safety of the trees. I wanted to scream for joy but I realized Moss Man might think I was injured so I restrained myself from screaming. About 2 minutes later I heard a scream behind me. I was pretty sure it sounded joyful but I waited anyway to confirm that. Sure enough it was McLovin who came down the trail with a big smile on his face and confirmed he was so happy to be out of the wind.
We caught up to Moss Man and all three of us hiked together to Pinkham Notch. We all agreed that this morning was the most dangerous day that any of us had faced on the trail. I told McLovin that I knew the winds had to be over 80 mph. This was confirmed by the weather report we received at Pinkham's Notch. I had a good bruise on my right shoulder and a sore right hip from falling into the rocks. I also tore a huge hole in my backpack form sliding down the rocks.
At Pinkham Notch, Moss Man continued on. McLovin and I met a wonderful couple, Birdy and Pilot, that along with their Christian Service Group were providing trail magic. Well about four quesadillas three hotdogs, and two sodas later I felt good. McLovin and I marveled that only three hours before we were on top of Madison fighting rain and wind and now we were with great people eating to our heart's content.

Pace, another Nobo had caught us and was hiking with us. After 6 miles of hiking we entered the Mahoosic Notch.The notch is a jumble of huge boulders stretching a little over 1 mile down a ravine. It takes most hikers at least 2 hours to climb and crawl though it. We met hikers that had taken 4 to 5 hours to do it.As we entered the notch it was evident early that Pace and I were very comfortable with overcoming the obstacles of the notch. For Achilles and a section hiker it was nerve-racking and a chore. I stayed back as Pace went on so I could coach Achilles and the section hiker on what paths to take, hand holds, and how to maneuver through the tight spaces. I really was in my element, I jumped from boulder to Boulder without fear and crawled through small tunnels the same. Being in the fire service for 32 years has made heights and confined spaces as natural to me as breathing air. All three of us made it through the notch in 90 minutes well below the 2 hours that it typically takes. Now you might think I'm exaggerating or have no sense of reality but I tell you with 100% certainty I could have easily done it under an hour.
After the notch, Pace, Achilles, and I hiked together up a steep mountain. Pace dropped back to enjoy the view and read a book. At the top of the mountain we met a wonderful young woman named Sam that said she would take us into the town of Bethel to resupply.

I've compensated by wearing long johns and socks at night.A mile after passing the 2,000 mile mark I came upon Maine HWY 27. There at the trail head was some trail magic! A nice man, that was waiting for his wife/hiker, had a cooler full of gator aide, fruit, and cookies. He also had lawn chairs. I sat down and enjoyed the drink and food. He told me that his wife was an accomplished hiker but he was worried because this was the same section where the hiker ""Inchworm"" had gotten lost in 2013. He said Inchworm's husband had been waiting for her at this exact same spot and that she had never shown up. She was later found dead two years later. This was really spooky and sad.

I was very thirsty so I couldn't take a chance on the next water source that was described in the guide as unreliable.After getting water, a half mile later I was at the unreliable water source. It was a great water source, someone had built a brand new box spring at the source. The water was pure and clean. I emptied out the water I had just got and replaced it with the water from the box spring. As I was leaving the box spring the two hikers that camped with me last night caught up to me. We made the short climb up to the top of Avery Peak. The sun had just begun to rise.This was probably the most magnificent sun rise I had ever seen in my life. As I looked to the east the sun as it came up over a distant mountain reflected its orange sunlight on two separate large lakes giving us the appearance of three suns at once. It was an amazing sight! As if that was not enough the 360 degree view from the summit was incredible. I would say that of all the incredible views I have had on the AT that this one would rate at the top. Advice to all future AT hikers is to plan your summit of Avery Peak at sunrise you will not be sorry!As I continued on I had a goal in mind that was driving me to put in big miles at a fast pace.

Unfortunately I was unable to get phone reception today to make that reservation so I was pushing hard to get there today to make the reservation for tomorrow.As I made my way to Harrison Pierce Camp I passed several lakes called ""Carry Over Ponds."" These ponds played a part in the U.S. Revolutionary War with Britain. The planned attack didn't work out well. Any way these were the lakes that reflected this morning's beautiful sunrise.At about 4 pm I arrived at Harrison Pierce Camp. I saw the owner and I said, ""I just hiked 25 miles today because I heard you have the best pancake breakfast around."" He replied, ""I'm all full up but just because you hiked 25 miles I will squeeze you in."" I then asked him if had rooms available and if I could reserve a dinner spot. He did have a room available but dinner was for the high paying guests only. I told him I understood but to come get me if he had to get rid of any leftovers.The room was a rustic one room cabin built in 1934. It had a wood burning stove and a kerosene lamp. I showered and then napped for about an hour until I heard a knock on the door. It was the owner, he said he had left overs. At the main lodge he piled a rib eye steak, sweet potatoes, bread, and salad on my plate with another bowl of salad and plate of bread beside it. He asked me if I could handle that much food. I stated that I would have no problem at all. As I ate dinner the owner played the piano, he was a very good piano player. I also had an awesome view of a far off waterfall.

The first one being Lyme's disease where he had to leave the trail and return home to Colorado to recover. I met him in New York where he had returned to the trail. His second obstacle was he had to return home once again, this time, to take care of his elderly mother. So now he is forced to flip flop to finish his hike. I have no doubt he will finish.Pony told me that he had issues in Baxter Park with the rangers as far as getting a permit to summit. He thought it was because he was sobo. I guess if you are sobo you are not eligible to stay at the shelter called the ""Birtches."" The ""Birtches,"" Pony told me was only for nobo hikers. Hopefully I will get a clearer understanding of the logistics of summiting Katahdin at the ATC station in Monson. I wished Pony good luck and said goodbye.I got to Hwy 15 a little before noon. I was just in time to see a trail angel drop off a couple hikers. He offered to give me a ride into Monson. In Monson, the first stop was the ATC substation. I went in and saw the same ridge runner I met a few days ago. She explained I had to sign up for the day I was going to summit.So I signed up for September 3rd. I was still confused about how I would reserve a spot at the shelter called the ""Birches."" To the best of my understanding it seems I have to sign some type of a list as I enter Baxter State Park. Confusing, I'll figure it out I'm sure so no more stressing about it. I have a card and I'm in the computer system.The trail angel, a past thru hiker (I wish I could remember his name), gave me a ride to the hostel. The Lakeshore House & Pub is right on the shore of Lake Hebron. I went into the bar and checked in. A waitress took my money and then took me upstairs to the hostel and gave me a quick tour.Once again I paid a little extra to have a private room. I showered and used some loaner clothes. I put in my laundry and then went downstairs to eat and check out the selection of beer. After eating and drinking a few adult beverages, I walked next door to a small bakery/store to resupply. Supplies were very limited at the bakery so I walked a little further to a gas station/store to get a few more things. I wasn't exactly satisfied with my resupply but it will have to do.Big party going on in the pub tonight. It is a Sunday night and 2 am and it is loud down below me and I can I hear a lot of people yelling outside. Oh well, on the trail I dream about getting to a hostel or hotel for a relaxing night in a bed. In reality I probably sleep much better in my tarp tent out on the trail.","Moxie Bald Shelter

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551400,I got up and walked next door to bakery/store/restaurant for breakfast. I then got a ride to the trail head from one of the employees of the hostel. It was 9 am when I reached the trail head. From this point on I would be in the 100 mile wilderness. I also had a great topo map for this section that I purchased in Hanover.I started off fast wanting to make up for my late start time. I knocked out 7 miles quickly until I reached Little Wilson Falls. This is a popular spot because of the scenic falls and large swimming hole. There were about 6 people there. Immediately I was approached by two women. One of them asked if I had cell service. I looked at my phone and I told her I had no cell service. She said she was having a medical emergency that she was having a hard time breathing. She did not look to me that she was in that much distress though I could tell she was exhausted with the look of she had enough of this thing called hiking. I looked at my map and told her if she walked another 2 miles she would reach a road. She said she had asthma and she couldn't walk another step. She asked me to call 911 for her when I got cell reception. Honestly I thought she bit off more then she could chew and she had just given up. As usual though I will always error on the side of safety so I promised I would call 911 for her.About 30 minutes later I got cell reception at an outcropping of rocks on the other side of the drainage. I called 911 and I was transferred to the local ranger station. The ranger took my information and then asked me to stay where I was so they could contact me if they needed further information. He said they would contact me in less than 15 minutes. An hour passed by and they had not contacted me so I continued on.For an area called the 100 mile wilderness I crossed a lot of dirt roads and even an active railroad track. I ended the day with a climb up Barren Mountain where there was an abandoned fire tower. Another 2 miles downhill and I found a stealth campsite at the base of Fourth Mountain.,"Maine Hwy15

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551411,"I was tempted with a short cut first thing in the morning. After studying my topo map I saw a way to cut mileage and avoid four mountains; Fourth Mountain, Third Mountain, Columbus Mountain, and Chairback Mountain. See the AT does not want you to miss any climbs so the trail makes a 11 mile horseshoe so you can hit all of these mountains. So you actually start heading South at the beginning of the horseshoe.Well I resisted temptation, I've come to far to ruin the integrity of my hike. I'm headed South when I come upon a hiker just sitting on the trail on top of his pack. He asks me if I'm a Sobo or a Nobo. I answer that I'm a Nobo. He asks why then am I headed South. I tell him because the trail has turned South for a few miles before it heads North again. It turns out the hiker is also a Nobo who got confused when he looked at his compass and it showed him going South. The AT is the most well marked trail I've ever been on so it has surprised me that I've ran into countless hikers that don't know which direction to head on the trail. I have come up with three reasons for this, there are probably more but here are the following ones I've come up with:1) AT hikers don't have maps because the trail is so well marked.2) A surprising amount of hikers don't keep track of the sun not knowing the sun always comes up in the East and sets in the West. Always!3) When you make a left turn off the trail to go to a shelter or campsite when you return to the trail you also make a left turn. It seems that many hikers think that because they made a left turn off the trail when they return to it they would do the opposite and make a right turn. This is the most common reason for hikers heading in the wrong direction I've observed. I've been asked at least a dozen times by hikers, when I've tented near shelters, which way to turn when they leave the shelter.I've thought a lot about this and I think because out West because our trails are not so well marked that hikers are much more aware of their surroundings and know how to use other tools to navigate then just a marker on the trail.After climbing the four various mountains and completing the horseshoe I forded the Pleasant River. There waiting was another AT Ridge Runner with her mother. She was there to count AT thru-hikers and to make sure they were aware of the procedures of entering Baxter State Park and summiting Katahdin. After talking to her I finally understood the process. Once I reach the boundary of Baxter Park there is a kiosk where I have to sign in for the Birches Campsite if I'm one of the first 10 hikers on the list I can continue into the park. Once in the park I hike to a ranger station where I check in once again. I then camp at the Birches. The next day I climb Katahdin. When I finish I need to check out at the ranger station. Okay I got it! I reached the summit of four more mountain today, a total of eight mountain summits. near the end of the day I was treated to a view of Katahdin. I'm running low on food. So I need to stretch what I have left for two more days until I reach the Abol Bridge Campground.","mile 2094.6 (stealth camp site)

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551430,"I went at a slower pace today. I have a heightened concern about spraining or breaking my ankle because the roots crossing the trail have once again become a major obstacle and I had heard several stories of hikers having to be taken off the trail this last week because of broken ankles. My nightmare is breaking my ankle and being unable to finish the trail now that I'm so close. One of the frustrating things about hiking the AT is that if you want to look around at your surroundings the safe thing to do is come to a complete stop. I have tripped countless times because of looking around or looking ahead while I'm still moving.There were no hard climbs today. I had to ford several streams though I was able to successfully hop rocks without getting my feet wet. I reached the Nahmahkanta Stream Campsite well before dark. Nahmankanta means ""many fish."" The Indians that lived this area were the Abenaki.It was an overused campsite, though I was the only one using it today. I set up camp and ate dinner. I ate the last of my food except what was left in my peanut butter jar. Tomorrow it looks like a strict diet of peanut butter. I have less than 50 miles to go!","East Branch Lean-to
",Nahmahkanta Stream Campsite,"Aug 31, Wed",23.80
BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551454,"Started my day by eating a couple spoons of peanut butter. No food in my pack except a jar of peanut butter that is only a 1/4 full. The good side of not having much food is that my pack is light. After I pack up I go to the near by spring and get some water. I'm off, I'm going to put in some miles today.The terrain is mostly flat. The inclines are short and not very steep. The trail as it has been is crossed and crisscrossed then crisscrossed again with roots, each step presents me with a decision on where to safely put my foot. My head is down rarely looking up. I'm tired and hungry though this is more than offset by my motivation to finish the trail. Every time I catch a glimpse of Katahdin I'm driven to keep pushing the pace.Because my head is down I inadvertently go off trail today a couple times. I'm surprised when I look up to see a blue blaze instead of the expected white blaze this means I'm on the wrong trail. Each time I made a wrong turn, I was not on the wrong trail for long. After a short back track and I'm on the AT once again. My attitude is still positive. I do take note that I'm making mistakes, a sign that I'm hungry and tired. For lunch I have the last of my peanut butter. There is a good chance I won't have dinner tonight.As I hike I have come up with two options. Option A is that I put in 25 1/2 miles and camp at the Hurd Brook Shelter. Option B is that I put in 29 miles and eat dinner at the Abol Campground Restaurant and camp at nearby Obel Pines. As I near the shelter trying to decide what option I will take I feel intense pain on the top of my left hand near my thumb. I scream out my worst cuss word and look down to see a huge blueish black wasp stinging me. I swat at it. My first swat fails to dislodge it, the wasp has its stinger in deep. It takes a forceful second swat to dislodge it. I'm still cussing. It hurts! I take off my pack and get my medical kit out. I take some Benadryl there is nothing more I can do. I continue on with my hand throbbing.I blow by the shelter I'm going to go for it. It won't be easy. It is 5:10 pm. I have 50 minutes to get in 3.4 miles before the store and restaurant close. I jog the rest of the way getting to the store with 10 minutes to spare. I ask the owner if I can order at the restaurant next door. He says he thinks they closed the grill for the night but I can ask. I go next door and ask. The cook says yes she will cook me a hamburger. Back to the store I buy miscellaneous junk food with the idea I'll return tomorrow to get more. Back at the restaurant I enjoy a hamburger, fries, and a soda.After dinner I walk a short way to Abol Pines Campground where I pay $8 at a self registration box to camp there. I find a nice camp spot on the grass next to the river. I'm invited by a kayaker to share his fire, food, and beer. I sit with him a short while but I'm exhausted and I excuse my self to go to sleep. Despite my throbbing hand that has swelled to three times its original size I fall asleep quickly cussing at wasps in my exhausted stupor.","Nahmahkanta Stream Campsite

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551480,"Up early. I was at the entry kiosk at the Baxter State Park boundary at 6 am. I found the sign up list for ""The Birches,"" the shelter for AT hikers that are going to summit Katahdin. I was the second person to sign up that morning. After I signed up I hiked the 10 miles up to the Katahdin Stream Campground. There I signed in with the ranger in order to climb Katahdin tomorrow. The process for an AT hiker climbing Katahdin in Baxter State Park is a several step process that is complicated. Don't make the mistake of not following the process because of its complexity. Baxter is one of the most patrolled parks I've ever seen and they fine permit violators without hesitation. After I was done signing in and answering the ranger's questions, he issued me a plastic card that read, ""Baxter State Park AT-Katahdin Hiker Permit, Trail Name: BASA, Name: Joe Telles."" My number was 597. I assume I will be the 597th AT thru hiker to summit Katahdin this year. Now being 597 is pretty good considering over 2,100 hikers voluntarily registered with the AT Conservancy to start their hikes before my May 11th start from the approach trail. That means I've passed over 1500 registered thru hikers. This does not include all the thru hikers that did not register with the AT conservancy. By 1 pm I was at ""The Birches."" The rest of the day I relaxed. Tomorrow is my final day on the AT.","Department of Conservation Abol Pines

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551739,"I would love to say everything was wonderful and joyous on my final day on the AT. It wasn't. This is not to say that it did not end joyous. It did!I woke up at 4:30 am not feeling well. My stomach was upset and I felt nausea. I heard the other 3 hikers getting ready so I put on my headlamp and began packing gear, the movement made me feel worse. By 5 am I was at the Katahdin Stream Ranger Station changing out my pack for a smaller pack (they lend out small packs). I left many of my items at the station. I would be traveling very light.I then signed in at a kiosk located at the beginning of the Hunt Trail up to Baxter Peak. The oldest of the three hikers (I wish I could remember his name!) was right in front of me as we left the kiosk. I do remember he was one year younger than me. Anyway as we left the kiosk, using our headlamps to see the trail, I felt really sick. I said, ""I'm going to have to turn back."" He responded, ""What?"" As he looked at me, I was bent over heaving what little food I had in my stomach along with a substantial amount of fluid. When I finished I said, ""Never mind."" I felt better. I thought maybe I could finish so I continued on. I told the other hiker I would be going slow so he moved on leaving me behind. I hiked on coming to the realization that I probably had a case of noro virus or giardia. My self diagnosis was leaning towards giardia since I had experienced it before and I felt exactly like that now. Nothing I could do about it at this point from a physical aspect but mentally I needed to toughen up.I had been through other physical challenges before on past thru hikes that included the past case of giardia and also kidney stones, urinary tract infection, heat exhaustion, and painful injuries.My go to compensation mechanism in these situations is to go into a self induced trance where I repeat a mantra over and over again. My go to mantra is a prayer, ""Thank you God for my strength, endurance, and determination.""Eventually I settled into a rhythm coping with my discomfort and made steady progress as I went up the steep incline towards my goal. I eventually reached a section of the trail called the ""Boulders."" This section required rock scrambling. The process of thinking how to traverse this section totally took my mind off my physical discomfort. I always enjoy scrambling and climbing rocks and despite my illness I still found joy. After making my way through the climbing portion I was above the tree line on a more gradual slope. I began to hear yelling from above me. I knew the three hikers had summited! As I came in view of the summit they saw me and began cheering me on. I began yelling back. When I reached the summit I hugged the other hikers and screamed the primal savage incomprehensible sound that comes out of me when I accomplish something big.I took a look at my surroundings, I was overwhelmed. The 360 view was incredible and the weather was outstanding. The sun was out and there was no wind. How lucky! I climbed the summit sign and balanced myself on the peak of the sign as my picture was taken. One of the hikers stated that he was stoked that he was the first hiker to summit Katahdin that day. I thought that was pretty cool and I was a little jealous. I then thought well I was fourth, that thought was no consultation to me. Then I had a thought that well I could be the first one to summit and make it down from the peak of Katahdin that day.As we finished our time on the summit I gave the other 3 hikers a wrapped piece of chocolate cake that I had brought to celebrate my completion of the AT. I could not eat it but I was pleased to watch the other hikers enjoy the cake.As we headed down Katahdin we took an even steeper more direct trail down. I still felt sick but it made no difference since I had gravity counteracting my illness. I also had no fear since I thought I could break or sprain my ankle now that I've finished the AT. So I flew down the trail only slowing down to navigate around the hundreds of day hikers coming up the trail. The day hikers invariably asked if I was a thru hiker and a short conversation entailed about my journey and also about their dreams of one day doing the AT. This was a great way to finish the trail with the acknowledgement and phrase of other hikers for the accomplishment of finishing the AT. Well I was first one down from the summit of Katahdin today. The trail finished in Abol Campground about two miles from Katahdin Springs Campground so I needed to hitch there to get my pack. The other three hikers had a ride to Katahdin Springs Campground from the family of one them. They didn't offer me a ride which was understandable. So I didn't wait for them at the campground. I stood on a dirt road and stuck my thumb out. One car passed by me and a second car approached. A brand new GMC Yukon pulled over and I jumped in. The driver's name was Rob. Rob wanted to summit Katahdin today but was unable to get a permit. He would have to wait until tomorrow. He not only drove me to get my pack, he drove me all the way to the hostel in Millinocket!So my hike is complete! I would love to tell you I'm a much better person and I had a spiritual awakening from this hike if I did that I think I would be exaggerating. I can tell you that this hike has been part of the process of me becoming a better person and becoming more spiritual. Hiking has become an important part of my life only ranking in importance behind my family and my friends. It has given me focus and a purpose since my retirement from the fire service. Next year I think I'll yo-yo the Colorado Trail. The year after that I don't know what my hike will be but it will be nothing big since I need to be around for my youngest daughter's high school graduation. In 2019, I plan on hiking the CDT and completing the Triple Crown. All of you take care. Thank you for your support. I will be writing some conclusion entries soon and spending a lot of time editing this journal to correct my numerous grammar and spelling mistakes. In my defense though many of these mistakes were caused by my inability to text adequately using my smart phone. Once again take care!","The Birches

BASA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552056,"I've been home now for three months! Well my flight home was miserable, I was still sick. Once I got home I saw my doctor she tested me for Giardia. My first test came back negative. I experienced symptoms another three days and called my doctor again. She had me tested again this time the tests confirmed I had Giardia!After taking my prescribed meds for 10 days I was cured! Two weeks after being home I went to Death Valley to hike the ""Lowest to Highest"" route. I was unsuccessful. After 50 miles over two days in 100 degree temperatures, I just wasn't feeling it. NORM (a hiking partner that can actually put up with me) and I decided to quit after two days and then spent the next three days exploring Owen's Valley.I've had a lot of time to reflect on the AT. For prospective AT hikers I want to be brutally honest about the challenges it presented for me. This hike is a physical challenge. The hills are extremely steep so uphill climbs will test your strength and cardiovascular fitness, the downhills will test your balance and your knees. I'm fortunate that my knees are good, I felt for the hikers that had knee problems. I don't know if I would do the AT if I had knee problems.The humidity of the south was also a challenge for me. I experienced heat exhaustion one day I think it was a combination of being tired and from drinking too much water without replacing electrolytes. The biggest danger I witnessed though is the presence of Lyme's Disease. The amount of hikers I came into contact with this insidious disease shocked me. I was fortunate that I did not contact it though I was bitten by ticks at least three times that I know of. I checked myself daily and wore long sleeves and pants the majority of the time. I was often questioned by other hikers for wearing pants and long sleeves with a statement along the lines, ""Aren't you miserable wearing that?"" I usually answered, ""No, not really."" I don't think I'll thru hike the AT again just because of Lyme's Disease, I know too many people that have the disease and it appears in their cases it is incurable. I don't think it is worth the risk of contacting Lyme's Disease to repeat the trail. Then again I'm not to big on repeating any trail with the exception of the ones I did not complete.With that said I'm glad I did it. I witnessed some incredible scenery. I met some incredible people. I believe the trail is a must do for addicted thru hikers. For others I would suggest they try other trails first before attempting the AT. This is just my opinion because I met several first time thru hikers such as Achilles who did great on his first thru hike who had no problem completing it. He and others were an exception the majority of hikers I met did not finish the trail. It was especially heartbreaking to see so many hikers quit after the first 50 miles.Speaking of Achilles I was glad I was able to hike almost 2000 miles with him before he eventually tired of me. That is almost as big of an accomplishment for a hiker as completing the AT, I'm not an easy person to hike with. I was asked by ""Crossroads"" in the guest book if I finished before Achilles. The answer is that I did by three days. Achilles is a much faster hiker then me but my experience makes up for that especially in the logistics part of hiking. The last time I saw him it was right after the two thousand mile mark where we both were at a trailhead receiving some trail magic. He had to hitch into town to get supplies. One of his statements to me was that I was great at logistics. At this point I think he realized that he was going to finish behind me. Another advantage I had was my endurance. Once I quit hiking with him at his much faster pace I was able to start the day at my much slower pace. I then was able to warm up at a much more comfortable rate and eventually reach a much faster pace at the end of the day. I also was able to hike longer. These last three months I have recovered fully from all my small injuries. I have continued to hike almost daily usually hiking twice a day getting in a total of 8 to 10 miles in. My goal is to get back the half step I lost the past three years from age. To do this I've added running back into my workouts. Well maybe I shouldn't call what I do running, it is pretty slow compared to what I used to be able to do. I also just got my mountain bike fixed, I haven't ridden it in three years. I think the combination of running and mountain biking with my hiking hills will get that half step back!",,Home,"Dec 03, Sat",0
