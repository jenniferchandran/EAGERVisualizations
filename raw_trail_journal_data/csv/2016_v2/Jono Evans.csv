Jono Evans,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526612,"There are a couple of ways to get to the summit of Springer Mountain where the trail starts. A popular option is to begin at Amicalola Falls State Park and hike the Approach Trail. The Approach Trail is about 8 miles of climb. The first section is 604 steps UP ascending to the top of the falls. The remainder is more UP to get to the Springer summit. It is a strenuous climb, certainly for the first day out for an almost 61 year old man. Some believe the Approach Trail should be counted as ""part of the Trail"", but it's not -- it is the Approach Trail. I figure a hike of 2189.1 is accomplishment enough and enough of a long shot. I'd hate to go 2181, breakdown, and not make it because of an 8 mile Approach Trail!So I took the other route. There is a parking lot 1 mile N on the AT. Getting there is a couple miles down Nimblewell Church Road (there seems to be a lot of Church Roads around N. Georgia) and a left on a dirt track named Forest Service Road 28-1. It is about 10 miles which is at most 1-1/2 car widths of a rough dirt road. The 10 miles took about 45 minutes to drive, ending at a PACKED parking lot -- lots of day and section hikers, I presume as there is a 14-day limit to parking, although I don't know who is going to traipse up there and tow you out.Starting at the lot, it's a pretty easy 1-mile walk S to the summit and the start of the AT, easy especially since I was returning to the car and spending a last cushy night with Gay, I could hike it with only a light day pack.The trail was busy with both thru and day hikers. And the summit, too, was busy. Hikers lolling around after dragging up the Approach Trail and others, like me, roaming around taking a couple of pictures of the Southern Terminus plaque and white blaze #1 -- #1 for north bounders, anyway. NoBos in trail parlance.So thus it starts -- with 1 mile complete. Tomorrow the adventure really begins!","Springer Mountain Parking Lot

Jono Evans,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527109,"   The most asked question during my preparations was ""are you going alone?"" Since I only have short sections where folks have wanted to hike with me, my answer was ""Yes, but there will be others on the trail"". That has proven itself to be a massive understatement.In my previous post I mentioned the Springer summit had been busy with both thru and day hikers. The shelter had been packed with tents tightly scattered in the surrounding area. Lots of picture-taking of the AT Walking Man plaque and the #1 white blaze for NOBOs - as seen previously, I participated in that ritual. There was one guy hiking the 100 ft to the summit with a buddy capturing the event on video. All good. Then, they went back down the trail to re-enact the scene. As I was leaving the summit they were filming a third take.   Apparently, the film's director demands perfection. Unknown whether this film will continue on up to Maine. At some point the director has to be satisfied with a single take.    My first ""real"" day started about 0930 with a goodbye to my beautiful and tolerant wife. Off I trudged. A perfect day, bright and sunny and warm. I was on the Appalachian Trail and I was alone in the woods. Then, I passed someone taking a rest. I took a rest and two different people passed me. As I continued it became apparent this was not a wilderness path thru the woods - it was a highway, and I left during rush hour!   I chatted with several people at Hawk Mountain Shelter. Amicalola Falls had been registering hikers as they crossed thru the arch to begin the Approach Trail. One guy told me he was number 1750 something to start, and that doesn't count those that started from the parking lot like me. They start counting on Jan 1.    Early April is the most popular start time and the trail is overwhelmed. Shelters are chockablock full by mid-afternoon and tents litter the surrounding woods. Hawk Mtn had about 20 tents surrounding the shelter, mostly solo hikers and a few couples. To be fair, it is Georgia Spring Break, so not everyone is thru-hiking. Regardless, the hiking and camping pressure on this portion of the trail is enormous.   At least for now, I am not alone.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Jono Evans,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529914,"The Bubble, Trail Names, and Blood MountainWith so many people beginning their AT adventure on April 1st, a large contingent tends to proceed up the Trail as a group for weeks. Individuals may speed ahead, but other earlier starters may go more slowly and fill the ranks. This glut of hikers is known as The Bubble. The Bubble was about 3-4 days ahead of my start (thankfully), and my plan to begin my hike at a modest 8 miles a day for the first week or so would help maintain that spacing. But, with so many people starting their hike in early April in general, you tend to fall into minor bubbles.I have been seeing a number of the same hikers throughout my first days - Giant, Jake, Dan, E&J, Jess & Josh, Ninja, Mountain Goat, Plodding Bison – we leapfrog each other along the Trail, but seem to coalesce at the same shelter or campsite in the evening. Some hustle up the trail and make camp by the early afternoon. Others struggle and plod, covering the same distance in hours more. But as they reach the campsite in the evening, there is typically a cheer that they have made it to the next stop, despite the struggle. Certainly a comradery builds amongst The Bubble. Trail Names are a custom of the Trail. True trail names are earned as a part of the adventure. You are not supposed to come with a trail name or anoint yourself with one. Trail names are typically earned as a result of some trait: Giant is a really big guy; Mountain Goat has a goat skull tied to his pack (I have no idea why). Or an anecdote: one hiker earned his name because he was playing with his bear spray and managed to spray it in his face – Mace was born. Plodding Bison is an example of a self-anointed trail name. Plodding Bison is probably a couple years younger than I am – we’ll call that middle aged, because I’m planning on living until I’m 120! She is a woman of larger carriage, but has a wonderful attitude about the hike. She is hiking to raise money for some Montessori school she has a relationship with and it appears she will not be denied. I met her my first day and she was struggling to hoist her pack onto her back. I offered to help but she declined saying “I have to be able to do this myself!” She went on to say that somebody had gotten her water the night before, but she felt that, too, was something she needed to endure as part of the adventure. Then, after thinking a minute, she said “You know, there are a lot of kids out here hiking without any money. I have money. I think I’ll just start paying some kid a couple of bucks to fetch my water!” I don’t have a trail name. A bit too some, I’m sure. A lot of people hear my name is Jono and ask whether that is my trail name. No, just a nickname from birth. Most seem to believe me. The first days of the Trail are difficult. You’re not used to the terrain, the routine, or anything for that matter. The climbs burn the thighs and the lungs; the descents batter the knees. No one is used to it. The first couple of days have their challenges, but the first ‘weed out’ point is Blood Mountain. After a couple of stamina-sapping smaller climbs, Blood Mountain is a tough climb to its 4400ft peak followed by a brutal 2000ft rocky descent. My Blood Mountain experience certainly included thoughts of quitting. I had lost track of the number of warm-up climbs and was losing confidence that I had enough energy or time to summit and descend Blood before dark. I considered making camp and continuing in the morning, but this area only allows camping if you have a bear canister to contain your food. A bear canister is a tough plastic container that latches closed and is supposed to also contain your food’s odors. I guess bears in this section have been more aggressive in their search for hiker’s food. It’s interesting, though; I camped the night before just prior to the bear canister area. There didn’t seem to be any geographical barrier that would hinder said aggressive bear from wandering the short distance to where no canisters are required. I half-envisioned the trail might be lined with panhandling bears begging for snacks as we passed through. I am finding I am carrying way too much food in general and actually would have welcomed an opportunity to share it.My trudge continued on for what seemed an eternity of ‘going up’. Every possible clearing that might have been the top seemed to merely obscure what was more climbing. I passed a couple of young day hikers and, looking bedraggled, asked “What mountain am I on?” “You made it! This is the top of Blood Mountain! And, at the bottom my group is cooking cheese burgers for everyone!” At the time, my finding the climb was over was the better piece of news. I felt a flush of relief and a rush of accomplishment. My thoughts of quitting – gone!After a spell at the top, my sense of accomplishment gave way to a quest to get down the mountain to the promised cheeseburgers at Neel’s Gap. The descent is actually quite a bit longer than the climb, descending about 2000ft down rocky steps built by the Georgia ATC. But the descent goes more quickly thanks to gravity. As I hiked I could hear the road below, and finally rounded a bend and could see the outfitter at Neel’s Gap. Finally! A tree out front was decorated with pairs of boots flung into tree as a last act of defiance for people who ended their hike after Blood Mountain. Rumor is that 20% end their hike after Blood Mountain and tradition is to leave your boots in the tree. But here I was and I felt pretty good. I met up with some others I had camped with the night before and asked where the cheeseburgers were. “All gone. They ran out a couple of hours ago.” Ugh! I’m glad I found out at the end of the hike. I’ll never know how much of an incentive that cheeseburger was. At least my boots aren’t in the tree!Note to the first entry: As I mentioned, the Approach Trail is a tough climb, particularly since it hits folks just as they step out of the car. There was a story of an older hiker, I believe a few years older than myself, who took three days to hike the Approach Trail, after which he quit his hike, without even a ceremonial tree to hang his boots.","Lance Creek

Jono Evans,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531139,"I went into this epic with a knowledge that my right knee was the weak point of the whole idea. The replaced knee had given me no problems, but my ‘natural’ knee had failed about a year ago simply walking on a golf course. No mis-steps, just regular walking. After an ortho visit, I learned that the right knee had osteoarthritis along with cartilage that had been somewhat shredded. No trauma at fault. I figure it was just wear and tear after favoring the other knee over thirty-some years of injury and deterioration. The hike up Tray Mountain was difficult. Tray is another 4400ft peak, but was made more difficult by a 1000ft ‘practice’ climb and descent and then the 1400ft climb up Tray. The hike was about 6+ miles from my campsite and I was on the top of Tray by about 1330. My legs were beat and I just decided I’d quit for the day and tackle the 11+ miles to Dick’s Creek Gap the following day. The view from Tray Mountain was terrific (alas, no pictures), but was even more spectacular at night. I awoke about 0400 for the nightly pee break and the night was crystal clear. Looking out from the summit the lights below were just beautiful and I could see the lights of Atlanta off in the distance – absolutely worth having to get out of a warm bag and into the cold night air. I got a relatively early start the next morning, packing up and moving out by about 0815. The hiking was great, the day sunny up top, but a chilly breeze kept me hiking with a jacket. At about 8 miles, a spur trail headed east to the next shelter and a water source. I didn’t intend to stay at the shelter, so I dropped my pack and toddled down the spur with my filter to get water for the last 3-4 miles. It turned out the water was about ¼ mile downhill, requiring another ¼ mile uphill return, miles for which no credit is earned – just extra. At any rate, the water source was good, a reasonable trickle coming down the mountain side and dropping over rocks. Can’t ask for much better than that. However, this reminds me of another water source not so nice. My personal rule is to treat or filter all water sources unless the water is coming through a pipe directly from the earth. I know there are many who judge water by whether it is fast flowing, or flowing over rocks, or at 'higher' altitudes, higher than what I'm not sure (germs?), but the truth of the matter is that regardless of how the water looks where you are, you have no idea what is happening upstream. There could be an animal carcass lying in the stream, or perhaps animals happen to use an area as their latrine. I was not going to risk days of “gastric distress” if I could avoid it!   I was heading up the practice climb prior to Tray Mountain when I crossed a water source on the trail. There was a guy about my age getting water and doing something at the water but I couldn’t see what. He was from Quebec and very much enjoying his hike. I noticed the water source was a pipe, so I felt I could trust it. After he was done, I grabbed my water bottles and went to fill them. As I neared the source, I noticed the pool of water just below the flowing pipe appeared quite cloudy, even whitish. I looked up at the guy and noticed he was wringing out a pair of underwear! He had just washed his underwear in the puddle directly below the water flow! Now that doesn’t affect the purity of the water I was going to collect, but it certainly puts the figurative bad taste in my mouth. I looked at him with an obvious “Really?” face and he quickly explained he had only fouled the puddle below, as if this makes it all OK. I suggested he might have gone a bit further downstream, but it didn’t seem to register with him as a real issue. Moving ahead, I placed my bottle under the piped flow. As I filled, my eyes moved up the pipe to find that the trusted pipe directly from the earth was really only a two-foot pipe lying in the dirt being used to concentrate the flow, a flow I now had no confidence in. With bottles contaminated with potentially unclean water and my psyche contaminated by the pool of underwear water at my feet, I mixed an extra strong batch of water purifier and added to my bottle. God only knows what microbial terrors I avoided. Anyway, I digress. The 3+ miles after the water source on the backside of Tray Mountain were beautiful, a steady descent into Dick’s Creek Gap. The hillsides were showing early spring growth as trilliums (trillia?) were starting to bloom along with a few other sparse wild flowers. As I continued down, my knee started to complain, but instead of the achiness that was the norm, it was starting to pinch within the joint and occasionally ‘catch’, throwing me off-balance. I had found that sometimes I could ‘walk out’ of the problem – keep walking and eventually the problem would subside - but not this time. By the time I got to Dick’s Creek Gap, my knee was complaining mightily and had started to swell a bit. With four days of wilderness ahead without any point to exit should I need to, I decided my hike had come to an end. I saw my friend Dan relaxing at the parking lot and he was waiting for a shuttle into town for the night. He offered to split his room with me and I accepted. With my decision made, I needed to figure out how I was going to get from Hiawassee, GA to Annandale, VA. I saw that the next town over had an Enterprise rental car office, so I reserved a car with them – I could just drive myself back home. Now, Enterprise has an advertising tag line “We’ll pick you up!” This pick-up, however, is only good for 10 miles. I was in Hiawassee, 19 miles from the car office in downtown Blairsville. I checked in with a couple of shuttle drivers, but they either never called back. I searched for a taxi company and found that the entire area apparently has one taxi, Daniel Baldwin (no, not the actor). I called and left a message. My phone rang some few minutes later.“Hello?”“Hello! This is Daniel Baldwin. You call for a taxi?”“Yes, how are you doing? I wanted to get a ride…”“Now wait a minute! Do you want to know how I’m doing, or are you just saying that?”“Uhhh, you’re right! How rude of me. How are you doing?”“Do you really want to know? We can just get into it if you want.”“No, no! Please, I want to know. How are you doing?”“I’m good. What can I do for you?”“I wanted to get a ride from Hiawassee to Blairsville.”“Ha! Let me guess. You’re a hiker that’s getting off the trail and you want a ride to the Enterprise office.”“Wow, you are either a crazy mind reader or this has been done before!”After a bit more chatter, he agreed to pick me up at 0915 the next morning. I spent the night at the Budget Inn of Hiawassee. I don’t think this place is truly affiliated with the national chain. If it is, they don’t visit often, or perhaps they get run off like revenuers here in the hills of Georgia. Certainly, the shuttle driver-grounds keeper-desk clerk looked the part. The rooms in the front are pretty non-descript, but my room for the night was at the back of the building (see picture) with the windows and doors facing a dilapidated cinder block retaining wall that I believe is probably weeks from toppling over. There was a chair outside each room so you could sit outside the door and enjoy the ‘view’. If something were to happen in those back rooms, I believe it would go unnoticed for quite some time. Or at least until the next batch of hikers appeared (generally a group that doesn't demand much) where the evidence would be swept out to any of the several overflowing dumpsters.   The next morning, I packed up and saw all the other hikers from the Budget Inn load into the shuttle to get back to the Trail. Shortly thereafter, my cab arrived. As Daniel arrived, I asked him how he was doing, giving him a wink so we could start the same repartee all over again. As I climbed in the cab, Daniel began to talk, and he is a talker! He told me about all the hikers that reserved cars at Enterprise only to find that they didn’t have any cars (he had warned me previously and I had confirmed they indeed had a car). He chattered away about people on the Trail and the townspeople. He then went through stories of how the Trail is full of troublemakers and criminals and how the Trail is an excellent place for no-gooders to get off the grid when they are otherwise ‘wanted’ in their lives. He told me of a local young lady who was hiking the Trail with her dog when a man befriended her. Unbeknownst to her, he continued hiking near her without being noticed and when she was separated from others, he kidnapped her. He tied her up in his truck, abused her for a couple of days before cutting of her head. An internet search later confirmed this story; thanks for sharing that upbeat story, Daniel!After mere seconds of quiet and reflection on this story, he turned and said “Do you know you are sitting in the same seat that Clint Eastwood sat in?”“How’s that?”“He was filming a baseball movie around here, Trouble With The Curve, and being the only taxi in the area, I was the exclusive taxi when they needed one! That college over there, Young Harris College? That’s where they filmed a number of the baseball scenes on their diamond. And let me tell ya, you may think that you and I can party, or we used to when we were younger (heh, heh), but those Hollywood guys can party. They were having their Wrap Party right over there. I was to wait right outside in case anyone needed a ride, but the movie Director presented me with a heap of papers I had to sign, one of which was that I wouldn’t enter the private party.”“So I was sitting outside in my cab for a couple hours and out comes the Director. He wasn’t doing so well as he staggered up to my window. “What are you doing out here?”, he asked me. “You had me sign a paper saying I wouldn’t enter the party.” “Bahhh”, said the Director, “Just don’t take any pictures”. So I went in. So, Clint Eastwood was leaning against the fireplace chatting with Amy Adams. All these Hollywood people just partying it up! There was a big commotion within a big group toward the back, so I made my way over there. Someone was doing a bang-up karaoke job, and when the crowd opened a bit, it was Justin Timberlake singing and dancing. Just surreal!”A much better story to end my journey!There was certainly some training I could have done to better test the knee, to see whether I should have started at all, but I intentionally didn’t look for it. I at least wanted to get started and hike for as long as I was able. I wanted to have an Appalachian Trail experience, a Georgia to Maine experience ideally, but at least some experience regardless. I have no regrets and I already have plans to get back on the trail in May and June. Short hikes over tens of miles and a few days. I’ll continue to hike as much as I’m able.","Tray Mountain

Start: Damascas, VA
Destination: Massie Gap, VA
Date: 22–26 May 2016 
Miles for this entry: 32.4    Total miles: 102        Miles to go: 2087.1
Last we met, I was limping home from the northern edge of Georgia as my knee had declared a moratorium on hiking.   Fortunately, after a few weeks off the trail, my knee was feeling pretty good and I was ready to do some more hiking. I had originally planned to meet Barry Miller, a lifelong friend (1st grade classmate!) in Erwin, TN, after Becca’s graduation and hike through the remainder of North Carolina. With my early departure from full-time trail life, and considering the fragility of my knee, we had the luxury of planning a conservative outing and cherry-picking sections of the AT.   We decided on two sections, the Roan Highlands of northern NC, and the Grayson Highlands of southwestern Virginia. We started with the Virginia hike.
We began in the town of Damascus, also known as Trail Town as the AT runs right through it and the town is renowned for being hiker friendly. Beginning on 22 May put us one week after Trail Days, a weekend-long party of AT hikers past and present that takes over the town of Damascus. The town allots a big field just south of town as “Tent City” and the town is a center of gatherings, parties, vendor displays, music, and food. It’s supposed to be quite a gathering, but the town was just a sleepy village on our arrival with just a few hikers passing through town resupplying or spending a town day. 
It should be noted that Damascus is also a very popular town for being about the middle of the Virginia Creeper Trail. The Creeper Trail is one of the most beautiful rail trails in the nation, winding along a river through the mountains and through farmlands of southwestern Virginia for about 34 miles from Abingdon to Whitetop Mountain. The rail bed was once the home of the Virginia Creeper steam engine that chugged through the Iron Mountains.   One of the beauties of the Creeper Trail is you can start at Whitetop Mountain and truly go downhill all the way to Damascus. Get a shuttle to Abingdon and go downhill or level again to Damascus. An easy, great ride for anyone, regardless of cycling ability!
We started in Damascus because it afforded better and, hopefully, more reliable long term parking and because we figured it would be easier to get a ride back to town rather than from town to a parking lot within a large state park. This decision meant that our predominant hiking would be up with Damascus at about 1900ft and the AT running up and over 5400ft before our finishing point just under 5000ft. The good side was the climb was over many miles with only a few steep trudges. 
Our first day was easy, hiking only about a mile, half through town and a half mile into the woods to a campsite. We got settled, cooked some dinner and the rain started about 1900 and continued until dark. Makes for an early and long evening just hanging inside your tent waiting for it to get late enough to go to sleep. 
The next day was a beautiful day with relatively easy hiking. Steady climbs in altitude, but nothing terribly difficult. A bridge washout diverts the AT from its normal route to coincide with the Creeper Trail for a bit. The Creeper Trail is a beauty, a broad cinder trail that would make for easy cycling. We quit after 10 miles, stopping at a picturesque pond. We were the first to claim campsites there, but several more encircled the pond by evening. We hit the hay to the sound of some very large bullfrogs singing their evening songs. The next day was another great day for hiking. Again, the AT joins the Creeper Trail for a short bit (0.7 miles) but then rises in elevation and parallels the Creeper Trail, looking down over the trail and the river rushing next to it. We stopped at Lost Mountain Shelter for lunch and water.
OK, so going to the bathroom outside is one of the obvious necessities of backpacking. For a guy, given our biological engineering advantage, peeing is no big deal. For women, every bathroom event means a trudge to a hopefully private spot to drop trou and go. #2, however, is the great equalizer of the sexes, inconvenient for all.
Every shelter has a privy nearby, a wooden structure housing a “mouldering toilet” which is every bit as attractive as it sounds. If a privy is not available, the accepted approach is to dig a “cathole” 6-8” deep, go, and cover. While this approach is the environmentally preferred method, I don’t relish it. With this in mind, I saved myself for the shelter, in this case, Lost Mountain Shelter. 
Shelters are typically hubs of activity. They offer the obvious, a roof over your head for sleeping, but also a picnic table and places to sit to eat instead of finding a rock, log, or clean patch of dirt. Sitting at a table is a luxury for a meal, believe me. A water source is always nearby and placing an entry in the shelter log serves as an audit trail of one’s progress. Most everyone stops at shelters. 
So after a leisurely lunch, I headed off to the privy. The privy was quite close to the shelter. As I approached, I gave the usual “low look” to see if any feet were visible under the wooden enclosure. Seeing it was empty, it was all mine. As I got close I noticed it was smaller than others I’d used, no door, but, whatever. I settled in and looked out. The privy was wide open and facing the passing AT, not more than 30 yards out the door! As I sat, I readied my best “Hey, how ya doin’?” for all that passed. Nice!
After lunch, we continued through the woods until the forest seemed to thin a bit, the trees allowing for sunlight to feed grasses across the forest floor. We came to VA 601, a remote road with a parking area for day hikers and horse trail riders. Crossing 601, the AT passed through fence stiles and into pasture land. We hiked in bright sunlight and tall grasslands. Up and over a small knob, we passed the indigenous inhabitants, a herd of cattle quietly grazing. 
The trail continued out of the pastureland and back into the woods, and after some steady climbing, re-emerged to rocky grasslands. A rugged final climb got us to Buzzard Rock, a rocky outcropping just below Whitetop Mountain with astounding views across the countryside. As we enjoyed the view and the breeze, a thru-hiker passed saying “Wow, that was quite a climb. Huh, nice view.” He didn’t even slow down, his mind set on making miles rather than enjoying the journey. 
After another mile or so of hiking, we settled in a grassy clearing on the other side of Whitetop. The view across the valley was spectacular as we watched widely dispersed lights come up in the countryside. The sky was clear and the stars were brilliant affording a great view of Mars and Jupiter.   
Morning brought another great day (we were very lucky, weatherwise) and a relatively short hiking day, although lots of climbing. The trail took us through beech forest and up into evergreen forests. We passed through or by more fence stiles, this time to contain the wild ponies that inhabit the highlands. We passed through seemingly other-world stands of firs with fallen trunks thickly covered in mosses and springs splashing across the trail. The rich, moist air was filled with the scent of firs and pines, nothing like the ersatz, manufactured odors of commercial products. Capture this natural smell and I’m buying! The trail emerged from the forest just short of the summit of Mt Rogers, skirting the peak to continue to Thomas Knob Shelter. 
Thomas Knob Shelter is exquisitely perched on a ridge overlooking wild expanses of brambles and rocky pasture falling down the mountainside. We found a great grassy campsite a couple hundred yards beyond the shelter. Our view continued across the remainder of southwestern Virginia to the 6000ft peaks of the Roan Highlands in North Carolina. 
After a brief rest, we went to conquer Mt. Rogers, the highest point in Virginia. The Mt Rogers summit was only about a half mile from our campsite and a climb of only about 300 vertical feet. The trail quickly returned to the dense evergreen forest blanketed in mosses. Sadly, the highest summit in Virginia is a viewless summit as it’s enrobed in forest, but we bagged the peak nonetheless. A bit anticlimactic as there is no sign proclaiming it as Virginia’s highest point; only a brass US Geodetic Survey button sunk into the rock. No flags were planted to mark our achievement, but our success was personally noted. 
The next morning made the trip. Barry woke early to the call of nature and asked if I was awake. Since I sleep terribly while camping, I was awake. “Look out of your tent, but go slowly.” I opened the tent flap and not more than 6 feet away was the foal of one of the wild ponies. As I emerged from my tent, there were four adults ponies grazing around our campsite with another half dozen or so grazing within another hundred yards or so. It was fantastic. They appeared not to care that we were there; they kept a short distance, but didn’t run, either. They just minded their grazing business. This was exactly why I wanted to hike the Grayson Highlands. 
Our last day was only a few miles to Grayson Highlands State Park and a ride back to Damascus. The trail wound through rugged grasslands and through rocky passages overlooking the Highlands. Throughout you could see the wild ponies grazing. 
The ponies are not actually wild, but feral ponies. They were raised specifically to live in the Highlands by a private rancher, but upon the rancher’s death, the herds passed to the state. There are three herds that spend the summers in the Highlands and move to lower ground in the winter. They live on their own, but the state provides supplementary feed during tough winters. A single stallion lives within each herd. The male foals are captured and auctioned each year, the proceeds going to the care of the feral herds. They are very tame, even to the point that they approach hikers begging for food or licking hands or packs for the salt. We didn’t experience such close encounters, probably because there was so much fresh, spring forage available, but it was fantastic walking among them. 
It was worth every mile we hiked and every foot we climbed.","Damascus, VA
