My trail name was given to me about a year and a half ago by a couple from Virginia while they were section hiking in N.H. I carry a pack full of water and other supplies between Trescot Rd. and Moose Mtn. shelter. As I returned to the trailhead I found my son in conversation with them. As we talked I shared my desire to attempt a thru-hike and used the term sooner or later [probably more than once] which prompted him to proclaim it my name to which his wife gave affirmation. Wherever they are I thank them as it has stuck. I am also greatful for the timing as we have since lost our son, giving my trail name more signifigance to me on the cusp of my attempt to become a thru-hiker by reaching the iconic sign at the end of the journey.","

It was a repeat of yesterday and I knew to try and leave could be disastrous. This is when some amazing things started to happen. That early evening a man came to stay by the shelter in his tent. As usual when someone saw my leg there expressions were priceless. I would assure them I was fine and we would move on from there. After supper he said he had antibiotics and gave me some. I would not normally do this but I could not leave unless I could neutralize the situation. I knew I also could not stay this way for too much longer so I started to take them.

I did not share my affliction for any other reason than to share good news. Great news actually. When I started this journey I was poured out, fatigued and not quite myself . The world had encroached upon my life. priorities askew. Though not a quarter of the way home I was being refilled. We all have choices. I left Damascus not well but in my affliction I had a choice. I could have taken on frustration, anxiety, sadness, anger and the list goes on. I embraced my affliction with peace, joyfulness, and faith. I didn't stare at the problem I chose to overcome it with optimism . I spent my days in the shelter caring for my leg but mostly enjoying the beauty of the forest and the bright sunshine and blue skies. I felt totally blessed for where I was and what I was doing. People came and went offering food or getting me water. Thank you all so much!! Much is learned as the result of the challenges of life. It is for me what I do with them that matters. The end result isn't of the most importance. My ability to respond never losing sight of how wonderful life is, is precious. Everything happened as it was meant to be because I got out of my own way and the end result was perfect. I understand more clearly now the statement that "" your faith has made you well"". This for me is one of the best experiences I have had to date. All things are possible. This I hope is but the beginning of revelation for me. My journey on the trail is not quite a 1/4 of the way yet and the transformation for my life is well underway. I feel like the most blessed man on earth. For some, they see the cloudy day. For me I see the sun above the clouds. We all have choices. What will we choose? We are all on a trail, a journey. How will we approach it? My wish is that more people could realize the power of all that is good and right in our lives thereby allowing resolution to take place rather than chasing our own tails. Look not at affliction as to be feared but put the fear into affliction by giving it to God. I will be back on trail in two days. I'm so excited I can't stand it.

I did my best and remembered I still had to hike. I did get some weird looks however from people as I smothered cereal in honey and half & half. I left there and climbed the steep rocks onto the Wildcats. It's one of those climbs that seem to go forever. There are multiple peaks then it drops down to the Carter Notch Hut where I took a break.

It was the beginning of much rock scrambling on steep ups and downs with no level ground between. Trekking poles became useless for some of this. I would find myself either pulling myself up and over a granite surface or lowering myself down. I really love this type of terrain and was having a lot of fun. I came up a pitch to find the NH Maine border sign and entered into the last state of my journey. I entered with mixed feelings. The collision of emotions would have to be worked out. On the one hand I didn't want the trail to end but on the other hand I miss Betsy and want to be home with her. Home is the more important but it feels like the hike happened so fast. Fortunately for me I have occaisionally pondered this and started to work it out. Maybe its just a thru hiker thing. I called it early today and headed for the shelter after an interesting and rather tiring day.

I stayed at the Stratton Motel which has a nice hostel with a full kitchen and living room. after a long shower I walked over to the White Wolf Inn and ate a wolf burger. I even got the tee shirt! Now I have to carry it. The challenge was easy so maybe they should consider adding at least another 1/2 pound to it. I enjoyed Stratton. It's small and has everything I need. The grocery store was across the street and the restaurant pretty much next door but most of all the fellowship of hikers along with a motel staff that has also hiked and understands us. I almost forgot. While I was eating my burger a storm hit hard. Rain came down in sheets along with high winds. There was also hail mixed in.

When I summited the first one I was met with high winds. The exposed peak of the west peak was gale force wind causing me to move sideways as I went forward. The trekking poles kept me on track until I moved back into the forest between peaks. I find great excitement when these sorts of things happen. The challenges are fun to overcome. Maybe it's the adrenaline thing. Coming off of the larger peaks the terrain became more level over Little Bigelow and I descended to the lean-to.

My destination is Pierce Pond so I'll be close to the ford of the Kennebec River. Hikers have to cross in a canoe because it's too dangerous to ford on foot. The hours for the shuttle start at 9 am.

I'm glad I didn't when I got to the shelter and found that it's right on the water. It was still windy but the view across the pond was really nice.

As the day progressed so did the heat and humidity. I drank lots of water and started taking breaks so as to not overheat. Along the way I called ahead to find every bunk and room was filled. The Lakeshore House decided to let me have a couch for which I was greatful. I was glad to finally arrive at the road crossing. I started to hitch and got a ride from someone in the parking area. Hitchhiking has been an easy process along the length of the trail and saved much time and money getting to and from towns where we resupply.

I blew out my shoes and there's nowhere to get another pair. In my usual way I knew it would work out and I wandered over to the other hostel and asked if they had any around.

It's always amazed me that even when trail friends are scattered wonderful new friends appear. At first Rabbit and I saw each other occasionally in different places.

It's only 16 miles as the crow flies from the peak to the finish line. Much of the days hike is relatively easy leaving me to reflect on this great journey.

I passed Ray in the rocks and reached the table lands where I could see my destination a couple miles away. As I was crossing thoughts of my son who is gone from this world entered in ,bringing tears because he could not be with me to share this moment. The moment subsided and the sign became visible at the end. I approached the sign evidently numb and devoid of emotion..... until I called Betsy! At this point I realized where I was and how I got here. The flood gates opened on both ends of the phone and praised He who got me here. It took the Lord I serve, Betsy, and me to accomplish this. I could not do this on my own. I had the whole peak to myself for at least 45min. which is a miracle in itself. The next person was Ray and he gave me so much joy with his reaction to summiting. I heard him go from a chuckle to full blown laughter as he approached the sign and with exuberance embraced his victory. I stayed until my other friends summited and celebrated with them until it was time to turn back. The first step down was quite possibly the hardest one I've ever taken but I also realized after a few minutes that this is not the end but just another beginning.
