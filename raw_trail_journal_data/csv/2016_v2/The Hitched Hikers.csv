The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523382,"Hello World,We took ""the leap"" on leap year and tied the knot on February 29th, 2016.   That makes us a pair of ""hitched hikers"". We had a fantastic pre-honeymoon in Costa Rica following our wedding but are looking forward to starting our real honeymoon on the Appalachian Trail in about two weeks. For our first post, we wanted to share some of the humorous advice and responses we have gotten from our family and friends. The range of emotions we have encountered fills the spectrum from curious, to shocked, to disinterested. Here are our favorites so far:* After hearing our plans, a friend from church said, ""my idea of an adventure is a nap!""* When we asked one of our nieces, 10 years old, if she wanted to do some of the trail with us, she said, ""I've got school..."" So basically she would rather go to school then walk outside- yikes!* One family member told us, ""Maybe you should go on the hike first, and then decide if you still want to marry her.""* Another friend asked how often we would be showering, to which we replied ""at least once a week."" That evoked a very loud ""disgusting!!!"" with the sarcastic comment, ""at least the smell will be effective for birth control.""* Our pastor wasn't so convinced, knowing it was a six month hike, quipped, ""see you guys in nine months!""We look forward to sharing our journey with all who are interested.",,Home,"Mar 13, Sun",0
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524266,"With a little over one week to go, we have been busy making final preparations. So exactly how does someone prepare for a 6 month hike? For us, it started several months ago. If you are married, you probably remember how busy it was just before your wedding arranging photographers, sending invitations, tasting delicious overpriced cake, etc.    The constant whizzing sound of a food dehydrator was probably not part of your story...So what is a food dehydrator? Basically it is a noisy device that you put food in to make your whole house smell like whatever you are dehydrating. No more air fresheners folks! Just cut up some strawberries. You can even go organic if that's your thing. Sure there are a few limitations. For instance, you cannot put anything containing fat in it because it will go rancid (i.e. The whole American diet). Beyond that, you just cut up food, place it on trays, and a little fan blows warm air over the food until it is lifeless, dry, and the wonderful aroma has filled your house. Which brings us to the title of this post. I think we inadvertently discovered a new way to torture cats. Just try dehydrating tuna! Im pretty sure the aroma would drive them nuts, especially if you threw in a little cat nip. It certainly seems to have brought out our dog's inner feline. If you are skeptical, it was definitely a human torture instrument. Wow. Overpowering.",,Home,"Mar 19, Sat",0
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524277,"In just one week, sleet or shine, we will begin what for some would be the trip of a lifetime! For us, the journey of a lifetime really began when we gave our lives to the Lord and it will continue forever. The bible says to ""seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all of these things will be added to you."" God had added so much, giving us great jobs, a beautiful home, he brought us together, and now he has given us this special time to spend together enjoying each other and worshipping him while exploring his creation. Wow! 
As this part of the great adventure begins to take shape, we have begun to say our ""goodbyes."". Really they are "" see you laters"". Farewells at church, farewells to friends. This morning, for example, he said ""see you later"" to shaving! His job for the last nine years has been in a manufacturing environment which requires a clean shaven face. Today was his last shave for seven months! Unfortunately, she likes his nice smooth face. In an effort to influence his decision, she threatened, ""I'm not shaving until you do!"" Which one will last the longest? Probably more blog posts on this later.",,Home,"Mar 22, Tue",0
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524856,"With this new chapter in our lives come many changes...one of them being change in occupation. We are now aspiring ""Thru-Hikers"" instead of our previous occupations. We have both completed our final day of work before we start our new adventure! 
Her last day was Thursday. She put away her nursing badge. She hung up her scrubs. She used a stethoscope for the last time for at least 6 months. She has bittersweet feelings about her last days of work. She's leaving behind a wonderful work family of doctors, nurse practitioners, and fellow nurses. She's leaving behind the precious babies she's been caring for since she began her nursing career. She continues her prayers for the sweet families she's met along the way. She looks forward to the adventure that lies ahead with her husband. 
His last day was Friday. His work group threw him an epic farewell party complete with an embarrassing poster signed by all of them, a cake reading ""Take a Hike"", gifts for the trail, and a sympathy card for his wife for what she is about to endure. His work coveralls are now all put away, his hard hat is in the closet on the floor, and his cell phone is no longer on call. He loves the responsibilities, being part of a team and the sense of purpose that his job gives him, but a brief break is welcome. He is looking forward, not looking back. He is looking forward to the new pages that will be added to their story.
On our first honeymoon in Costa Rica, we heard the saying ""Pura Vida"", which translates to ""Pure Life"". Over the next six months we are looking forward to discovering what ""Pura Vida"" really means. 
And just like that, we're off. We're starting the 15 hour drive from our home in Texas to his family's home in Florida to celebrate the Resurrection of our Savior, Jesus Christ. They will be driving us to Georgia where we will begin our journey on Tuesday!",,Florida for Resurrection Sunday,"Mar 25, Fri",0
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525044,"So after nine years of discussing weekly safety topics on the job, he can't help but continue the tradition on the trail. On the trail, the worst insect born illnesses are Lyme disease and West Nile virus. In this picture, you can see him holding a yellow spray bottle and decorating a bush with hiking gear like a Christmas tree with ornaments. What he is doing is applying Permethrin to their gear. It is a mosquito and tick killer. You can spray it on your tent, backpack, socks, pants, etc. if you do outdoor activity, we highly recommend picking up a bottle. Sawyer sells a 12oz and a 24oz bottle, and both come with a sprayer. It can also be used to kill a bee infestation if you buy it in dust form (he knows this from personal experience). Along those lines, when he got it to kill bees, it was labeled as a dust for garden insects... Do you really want to kill your pollinators? Speaking of killing things, it is safe to use on dogs to kill fleas and ticks but is fatal to cats...",,Florida on Resurrection Sunday,"Mar 27, Sun",0
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525265,"Our first day on the trail! His older brother (aka Keith Urban) and dad drove us up to Cummings, Georgia last night where we stayed with one of his first cousins. Thanks guys! This morning, we thoroughly enjoyed sleeping in, taking long showers, giving it time to warm up a little. His brother and cousin walked with us to the top of Springer mountain, and we are off!
Apparently some people come out here to find themselves. We are definitely not in that category. We joked with our coworkers before leaving that if we started posting poetry they should be worried. But right at the start of the trail on a plaque there was this fabulous gem:
* ""A footpath for those who seek fellowship with the wilderness."" We seek fellowship with each other and our creator, not his creation, but it is a nice sentiment. Along those lines, here are a few other gems that we will have time to ponder while on our journey:
* ""The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."" Thoreau
* ""The mountains are calling, and I must go."" John Muir
* ""Once in a lifetime a man ought to concentrate his mind upon the remembered earth. He ought to give himself up to a particular landscape in his experience; to look at it from as many angles as he can, to wonder upon it, to dwell upon it."" N Scott Momaday
* ""The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully."" Psalm 24:1-4","Springer Mountain
","GA, High Tower Gap, 8.6","Mar 29, Tue",8.60
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525520,"Thanks to all of the friends who have visited us along the way. If you haven't come out yet, join us for a stroll in the woods (or shuttle us to a hotel and a restaurant!)

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525526,"This morning we woke up in a tent! Yay! We were itching to get get on the trail so we grabbed pop tarts instead of cooking. Sorry Kelloggs, not the ""breakfast of champions"" (wheaties arent either). We were hungry very quickly after and had to eat Golden Grahams and a cliff bar as well. Today we hiked 12 miles. The last 7 were uphill. We camped on the slopes of big cedar mountain and will leave the summit for tomorrow. 
 Both of us are starting to get small blisters on our right feet. Maybe because we are right handed we use that side of our body more? Or maybe we just need to lighten our packs... Ironically, at a road crossing a few miles before we finished, some people offered to give us a free ""pack shakedown"". They claimed to be expert hikers offering advice on reducing weight. They seemed sketchy though and we weren't about to let random strangers help themselves to our packs! There are lots of people who offer services to ""help"" hikers. Occasionally people give out food or other things and call it trail magic. More on that in a bit.
 Speaking of sleeping in a tent, our sleeping bag was so comfortable! If you are a set of honeymooners, we recommend that you carry the double sleeping bag made by big Agnes called the King Solomon. King Solomon was the richest king of the ancient Hebrew people and built the very first Jewish temple in Jerusalem (both of us have seen the Temple Mount where that amazing building once stood). His life was so blessed but he forgot the source of the blessings and his heart turned away from the Lord. Don't worry though, the sleeping bag isn't going to have that affect on us! At a little over 4 pounds it keeps two people warm in 15 degree weather which is a good weight for winter camping for two people. We will be trading it out  for the Nemo tango duo when the warmer whether comes in May. The sleeping pads really make the bag.
 So back to trail magic- early in our hike someone at a road offering offered to take garbage from hikers. Every one makes a difference. What a blessing. And near where we stopped there was a touring bus from a communal Christian sect set up handing out free meals to hikers. They had a beef lentil soup. The bible mentions a guy named Esau who was drained after a day of hunting and came home to a bowl of soup made by his brother. It says he was so hungry he traded his birthright for it. We now know how hungry he was! 
 One question we get is, ""aren't you bored?"" The short answer is no! We have been memorizing the gospel of John together. Today, we learned that ""The true light, which gives light to everyone"" came into the world and that when we believe in him, we are children of God. When we met those nice people handing out meals, it reminded us that there are lots of people offering answers. They were offering a chance to live off the grid and be part of a community. What Jesus offers, though, the true light, is life and a chance to be part of his kingdom.","High Tower Gap
",Woody Gap,"Mar 30, Wed",12.50
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525788,"Today we started near woody gap and climbed two mountains. The second was called blood mountain because of an Indian battle that took place there. It took us most of the day to climb up and down it. We hiked to the bottom to a place called Neels gap where we were picked up by friends. SHOWER. HOME COOKING. BED. WASHING MACHINE. It rained the whole day, which means our rain protection got a really good test. So let's pause for a quick gear review:
 * The good- neither of us got wet feet (figuratively and literally). Vasque makes great rain proof hiking boots! We really recommend them. She used hers to climb Kilimanjaro a few years ago and they still keep you dry. Also, we read online that trash compactor bags are a good way to keep the stuff inside your hiking backpack dry. Mission accomplished. we put everything inside the bag, and put it inside our packs, and our gear stayed dry. 
 * The bad- His rain pants let quite a lot of water in. Thankfully it appears to have been a user error. They completely zip up the sides for ease of removal (maybe strippers use these? We wouldn't know...). If it wasn't obvious, you have to zip them all the way up to keep water out...
 * The ugly- Her pack cover failed completely. We eventually just gave up on it and tucked it into her pack. Also, fitting because it happened on blood mountain, her rain jacket pocket zipper fell apart early in the day without our knowledge. She got a small cut on her finger reaching her hand into her pocket. Not a huge loss, though, because the rain jacket leaked. It was an older rain jacket, soon to be a trash item.
Despite the rain, we couldn't helping singing. God is good. There were supposed to be thunderstorms and we just prayed that the Lord would hold them back until we were off the mountain. As we got to the top, we ran into another hiker who was complaining because he had all his rain gear on and there was no rain at the top! We may have asked the Lord to give him what he wanted after we were gone from there. It was a bit exposed and we didn't want to be in it up there with lightning, hail, etc. Some friends picked us up for the night which was a blessing because apparently there were tornado watches forecast for the night and the next day. The friends have a house but only visit it 4 times a year. They just happended to be there this week. We don't believe in coincidences. God is good. The song that stuck with us in the rain all day was based on an old Irish poem and it goes like this:
 ""You make the road rise up to meet me, you make the sun shine warm upon my faces, the wind is at my back, and the rain falls soft, God I lift you high...""","Woody Gap
","Neels Gap, Off Trail","Mar 31, Thu",10.60
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526154,"Well, we quit the trail. April Fools Day is the number one day when people start hiking the Appalachian Trail. What does that say about people who hike the Appalachian Trail? What does that say about us? We actually didn't hike today... Stayed with some awesome friends who rescued us from terrible rain yesterday. We took the time to rest and eat lots of food. (We still probably walked 4 miles around town lol). We will hit the trail again tomorrow. Guess we aren't good quitters. As a side note, today is the first day of his adult life that he hasn't been paid! He was using up vacation until yesterday at work, but today was officially unpaid. Weird! Did you know that the bible says in 2 Thessalonians 3:10 that if a man won't work, he shouldn't eat (I.e. be given handouts to eat for free)? Working is good for us. In fact, God created us to work. We love working and will be hard at it when our honeymoon is over. Right now our job is to finish this trail!","Neels Gap
",Off Trail,"Apr 01, Fri",0
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526147,"Today we went to Neels Gap after a hearty breakfast with friends. We had our packs shaken down and adjusted at a camp store at the road crossing. A guy named Pretzel helped us a lot. Without food and water, both our packs now weigh 25 pounds each. They will be much lighter after the winter season when we can ditch extra layers and swap to our summer sleeping bag (also super comfy for newlyweds of course- the Nemo tango duo- weighs about 2 lbs). We got a really late start (almost 2 pm) but still got decent mileage in. The views today were spectacular. The trees still don't have leaves and with the rain the last few days the sky is really clear. We got some good pictures which would have made for a good post except that in the evening we stumbled upon a tree that had a knot growing on it shaped just like his nose! It even has the bump. Amazing!
 For the next season of hikers, here is our advice to you. Don't bother with rechargeable batteries that require you to carry a charger. Don't waste your time with a solar charging kit (plenty of places to charge a phone). A GPS is totally unnecessary (get the AT hiker app for your phone if you want one), we even ditched our bowls. Meals cook right in the bag or can be eaten directly from a pot. We didn't listen to them about ditching our super comfy fleece pants, but will get rid of them when it warms up. Speaking of cold, do buy a warm enough sleeping bag (ran into a guy we affectionately called ""kneebrace"" who made that mistake- it was below freezing last night- oops!). Don't pack too much food (we are still eating what we brought a week ago and have been to town already, why carry it).","Neels Gap
",White Oak Stamp,"Apr 02, Sat",7.80
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526312,"This morning we woke up in a place that was away from the nearest road crossing. We got a late start (don't judge us, we are married) and began our hike by 11am. It was very cold and windy last night so it didn't hurt to let it warm up a bit. We hiked our longest day so far and made it to Unicoi gap by around 5. From there, a really nice lady who had just finished a day hike, offered us a ride into Helen, Georgia (a Bavarian themed mountain town with a river wandering through). A fellow hiker from Alabama named Mountain Goat caught a ride with us. 
 We are staying in the River Bend Motel and Cabins. The person at the desk was awesome. We had called and checked for availability. When we got here, the guy at the desk handed us keys and told us to go to our room, take a shower, and then come pay. He also recommended a good German restaurant called ""Bodensee"". Wow, we would go back. The sampler platter for 2 could feed a family of bears that just woke up from hibernating (we were hungry from the hike and finished it). The waitress saw that we were really thirsty and gave us to go cups of water. Thanks! 
 We just bought a cookie and grabbed a few hot cocoa packets from the lobby to make a dessert. Off to the river to enjoy it on one of the swings this beautiful waterfront hotel has. By now some of you may have realized that we aren't really roughing it. Yup. It's our honeymoon after all. Later.","White Oak Stamp
",Unicoi Gap,"Apr 03, Sun",13.40
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526454,"This morning we started out in Helen Georgia. After a hearty Bavarian breakfast, we caught a ride from Betty's IGA back up to where we were picked up last night. Thanks Betty! (Actually, thanks Betty's daughter, who currently runs the store). One of us had an upset stomach (surely not from dinner!) so we went really slowly today. ""Pole, pole"" (pronounced pole-A) is a Swahili phrase that she learned hiking Kilimanjaro that translates to ""slowly, slowly"".   Progress seemed slow, but we still finished with over 13 miles which is pretty good.  At the top of the big mountain, called Trey mountain, we came to some really nice views. The woman who drove us into town yesterday lamented the lack of good views. Hopefully she comes up here some time. Ironically, it looks like someone trimmed the brush so that we could enjoy the views. It didn't bother us any.  We camped near the deep gap shelter tonight. Met another married couple about our age that seemed pretty nice. They were going to sleep in the shelter, but a mouse ran across a ceiling board and scared them into setting up their tent. Maybe we will see them again. Her name was ""snail"" and his was ""sandal."" The are hiking in sandals (we would be done because of rolled ankles if we tried that). Our competitive nature compels us to compare our mileage with fellow hikers. It was quite satisfying to learn that they had started two days before us, hadn't taken a day off yet, and were just as far as us.","Unicoi Gap
",Deep Gap Shelter,"Apr 04, Mon",13.10
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526569,"Today was a ""Nero"" day for us. A ""Nero"" day is when you hike nearly zero miles. Today we hiked only 3.6 miles from Deep Gap Shelter to Dick's Creek Gap. It was a lot of uphill followed by a lot of downhill. Thankfully the tummy troubles from yesterday have resolved and we had new energy today! 
On our way down this morning, we chatted with a fellow thru hiker. He first hiked the AT in 1980 and is hiking again with his son! Wow! To leave such a legacy! We hope to leave the same legacy in our family! This man gave us the phone number of some women who shuttles hikers for a reasonable price. We decided to give them a call to get to Hiawassee for the day. 
Our shuttle driver, Joyce, first took us to drop our bags off at a hotel. She gave us the details of the three hotels in Hiawassee. We decided on the Holiday Inn that has a hot tub and free hot breakfast. When we asked to get a room another hiker was checking in and offered to share a room with us. We took her up on the offer and in return we paid for her laundry, dinner, and also the shuttle back to Dick's Creek tomorrow morning. It's a fair trade, and she said she got the room with reward points and she was thankful to be able to share it with someone. 
After we dropped our bags off, our shuttle driver took us to Brasstown Bald, the high point in Georgia. On our days off we just can't sit still! We climbed the 0.6 mile paved trail to the top of Brasstown Bald and enjoyed the amazing view! It was so fun to see the mountains we have been climbing for the last week! 
We had originally planned for Joyce to come pick us up at 5 pm...but we found some kind people to hitch a ride back to Hiawassee with because we were finished before 5. They let us ride in the back of their truck. We have really been appreciating the kindness of strangers!","Deep Gap Shelter
",Dicks creek,"Apr 05, Tue",3.60
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526990,"Today we got a late start...our room buddy who we were shuttling back was a little slow to get started and preferred not to take the shuttle at 9 am. We tried to reschedule for 10, but they couldn't get us until 10:30. We didn't get started until after 11:00. 

We hiked a big up and then a small down. We sat for a lunch break where we were surprised we had done 5 miles in about 2 hours! That was a pretty good pace considering one of us was still on the mend from a tummy bug. While we were eating lunch, we met Josiah. He told us he had already done 15 miles today! Crazy! He went to the shelter because he was done for the day. 

After lunch we pressed on toward our goal for the day...the North Carolina/Georgia boundary! We were so excited when we got there we hugged the tree with the sign! One state completed! 

We had no mileage goal for the day, we just thought we'd hike until we were tired. Josiah caught up to us on the way up Sharp Top. He passed us so easily we started calling him ""Jet Pack"". He said he didn't feel done so he decided to go on to the next shelter, Making his total mileage 23 for the day! We need to step up our game! 

We heard there was going to be some bad weather, so we thought we might stay a night in a shelter so we wouldn't have to pack up our wet gear and we'd have the chance to get an earlier start the next morning. We came to Muskrat Creek Shelter and it appeared as though everyone had heard about the coming storm. It was so full we didn't even stop and instead decided to hike until we found a place to camp. It worked in our favor! We hiked 0.9 miles past the shelter and there was a new camping area cleared at White Oak Stamp that is not marked in the guidebooks yet. We were the only ones there and we certainly enjoyed it! 

We hunkered down for the storm and got in our tent quickly after dinner. We went to sleep early and hoped for a good night's rest. As soon as the rain, thunder, and lightening started one of us awoke to some residual tummy whoas and had to brave the elements. Not the most pleasant experience, but we're both thankful we have each other in those types of instances!","Dicks creek
",White Oak Stamp,"Apr 06, Wed",12.60
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526991,"Today we woke up in North Carolina determined to go the distance. Even with a late start (about 10am) we still managed our furthest day yet, with over 15 miles. The sun ran out before our legs did. It wasn't an easy day either. We started with a series of long climbs eventually putting us at our highest elevation yet (5,498'), which by the way is higher than the highest mountain in Georgia, Brasstown Bald. Georgia had hills by comparison. The weather started out cool and damp and got progressively worse throughout the day, ending with hail and lightening. We finished our day just before reaching the 100 mile mark at a small but congested campsite near a creek.
Along the way we met a hiker named ""prairie star"". She was a really nice middle aged woman from Nebraska. We had two unfortunate run ins with her. The first time we crossed her path, she was stopped to take a picture of a sign. He couldn't resist offering to take her picture with it. The sign read ""chunky gal trail""... A little later as she was coming to a road crossing she lost her footing and did a face plant as we were eating our lunch. We rushed to assist of course. She confessed it wasn't the first time. Good thing she already had a trail name...
And now for some ""potty"" humor. So apparently we weren't the only ones getting high up in the mountains. Prairie star told us that she couldn't believe it when some guys at her shelter were already lighting up before breakfast this morning. We wrote them off assuming they wouldn't make it very far, but sure enough, a group of 5 college aged guys came strolling by, bragging about their weed smoking. Yikes! Their reputation certainly proceeded them. They seemed to lack direction and ambition but were otherwise harmless. That wasnt our first run in with the pot today. You see, it got off to a ""crappy"" start. While one of us was tending to the diary, the other was tending to the diarrhea (in the pouring rain in the middle of the night!). The only thing that would have made it worse would have been to be buried in a cemetery we passed several miles from Springer mountain. The sign directing you to the cemetery was an old toilet seat cover. Now that's crappy!","White Oak Stamp
",Betty Creek Gap,"Apr 07, Thu",15.40
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526992,"This morning we set our eyes on the 100 mile mark. After 10 days since starting on the trail (including one off day, and 3 half days), we were ready to push ahead. That may not seem like a lot, but we have been consistently pushing a couple more miles per day then most hikers. The advice is to take it easy until you adjust to life on the trail. We came upon Albert Mountain, the first mountain worth conquering! It was steep, so much so that trekking poles became useless and hands became necessary. It was so cold, the first time we tried to take a picture of ourselves, the phone shutdown due to temperature. But it was satisfying. No more were we just ascending one hill just to get to the next. This was a destination. 
 In general, the trail seems to be more intentional in North Carolina. In Georgia, the trail just took on the hills (they called them mountains) by brute force, running straight over top of them to get you quickly out of the state. In North Carolina, the trail seems to run around the hills instead of over them, giving you the feeling that you are meandering, not in a hurry, with purposeful ascents, rather than just being moved as quickly as possible from one place to another. 
 Not only has the nature of the trail changed, the weather seems to have as well. Probably because we are now over 1000 feet higher than our first week on the trail, in the last 24 hours, we have experienced rain, thunder, lightning, hail, and snow. The snow was beautiful! Probably our prettiest day yet of hiking. But with forecasts of 55mph wind gusts over 3500 feet, we chose to catch a ride and spend the night in a hotel in Franklin vs risking having a tree fall on us in our sleep. It seems a plausible scenario given all the down trees we have seen while hiking. We have even heard a few at night. It is a sobering sound when you are in a tent surrounded by trees...
 Before we got off the trail, we met some other hikers who were waiting for a ride. We mentioned in our previous post that we had heard about some hikers before we met them. Occasionally, people's reputations proceed them on the trail. Apparently, the same is true about us. Probably because for the most part we haven't camped near the shelters, which tend to be crowded this time of year, a lot of people have heard about us but haven't actually met us. Something similar to this has happened to us three times now. One of them said to us ""you're the hitched hikers!? We've heard about you!"" followed by ""congrats"", and ""I'll buy you a beer in the next town."" Well, that sentiment is appreciated but totally unnecessary in Franklin, North Carolina, the land of free beer today. We stopped in an outfitter after catching a ride to town. There was a large sign ""Free beer for thru hikers."" Our next stop was a pizza place called Gondolas. We learned that it was cheaper for them to just give away beer with the meals then to buy the liquor license. What a fantastic business model. Should have seen all the happy locals drinking free beer. There was even beer in the hiker box!","Betty Creek Gap
",Winding Stair Gap,"Apr 08, Fri",12.20
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527160,"Today we got another late start...we checked out of our hotel in Franklin at 11:00. Without scheduled shuttle services on the weekend, we decided to hitch hike. We walked down to 64 west and stuck out our thumbs. It took about 15 minutes for someone to finally stop and offer a ride. The man who picked us up had just finished turkey hunting...we felt really safe in his truck, he held onto his shotgun the whole drive :o) We got to Winding Stair Gap 11:40 and starting hiking. It was a lot of uphill today! One of the highlights of today was lunch...we had leftover pizza from last night. It was so good! Not a lunch we would usually have due to the weight, but we certainly enjoyed. As someone wrote in a log book at a shelter, ""Every bite is a victory because it's one less thing you have to carry."" We're happy to report victory over the pizza, we have none to carry :o) We got our first trail magic of the day at Wayah Gap. A former through hiker from 2014 set up a trail magic station. There were all sorts of snacks and sodas. We enjoyed a soda we shared, chips, cookies, and candy. We certainly weren't in want for snacks! We hiked a while longer and ran into our second trail magic of the day at Wayah Bald! A boy scout troop from Tennessee had a tent set up and had dinner and snacks. We had hot dogs, a black bean burger, chips, and lots of hot cocoa! They were very hospitable and sent us away with more snacks than we needed. They gave us hard boiled eggs and string cheese and we even have powdered donuts for breakfast tomorrow. We are so incredibly thankful for all the trail magic today! We trekked on to mile 122 at Licklog Gap to camp. The view is beautiful from the camping area and the area is nice and flat. It's supposed to get to 26 tonight! We're bundled up and plan on cuddling to keep warm tonight! We plan on getting up early for a big mileage day tomorrow!","Winding Stair Gap

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527308,"This morning we woke up in lick log gap. It was cold (in the 20s) but we stayed warm and cozy in our sleeping bag. Too cozy! Got off after 9:00... We have been trying to get going faster in the mornings.   This morning it took us 35 minutes to tear down camp. Still seems too long but it's a new record for us. We had breakfast on the trail at the first nice viewpoint we came to. Our goal for the day was to make it to the NOC where we will pick up our first mail drop in the morning. We need enough food to get across the Smokies because there are no resupply places for about 70 miles. Food is actually a double edged sword. If you carry to much, the weight really gets to you. We actually still have 2 dehydrated meals that we started with along with unused breakfasts and snacks. That's probably about 5 lbs extra we have carried for the last 3 weeks! We saw in a guest book somewhere a hiker wrote ""every bite is a victory!"" We really understand what hey meant. 
 NOC stands for nantahala outdoor center. It is an outfitter for white water rafting right on the trail. If the water wasn't so cold, we'd probably take a day off for some river fun... We had an ulterior motive in getting there tonight- they have hamburgers! Along the way, We climbed a big mountain, climbed up a pretty observation tower (and made a wonderful hot lunch), climbed another mountain, descended forever, yada yada yada hamburger! The suspense really made the burger. For about an hour we walked with a man named Jeff Davis. We made the mistake of asking how he got his trail name- it wasn't a trail name. He was very proud to be both from the North and bear that name. He talked a long time about how many calories you burn hiking and how scrawny you get. It was his second hike so he remembers eating all kinds of weird things (mussels from streams, frogs he caught, etc.). We both feel a little thinner after the last 3 weeks. Imagine 6 months? After arriving, we splurged and got the brownie with ice cream. Not bad going on an all you can eat diet right after your wedding and still losing weight. 
 Tonight we are camping along the beautiful Nantahala river about a 5 minute walk from the NOC. There are some really wild partier type hikers in the area so we setup camp on the other side of the hill. Now all we can hear is the peaceful river. Enough about food until tomorrow when we get breakfast at the same place. Our friend El Tejano ate here a few weeks ago and we have been looking forward to it ever since.","Licklog Gap
",The NOC,"Apr 10, Sun",15
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527490,"Today we hiked about 7 miles uphill, followed by several very steep downhill miles. The terrain was by far the most difficult we had come upon. We started out with breakfast at the NOC. French toast, eggs, hash browns, coffee, yum! Afterwards we picked up a package at the outfitter. Thanks Abe for sending it to us! Now his pack is very heavy. We took his pack in to have it adjusted and found out that he is actually a large size but is hiking with a medium pack! To make matters worse, the last guy who looked at it made it as small as possible. Perhaps that was a joke? In any case, the weight is now at least on his hips instead of his shoulders. For those of you entertaining going on a hike yourself, get fitted, and then get a second opinion. But don't expect any two outfitters to tell you the same thing. We don't think that they are intentionally being like politicians, but the behavior is similar. After leaving, as mentioned, it was very difficult and mostly uphill. We had a late lunch on top of a bald spot on a mountain and then headed down into a gap for the night. Thankfully, other hikers had arrived there and taken up all of the good campsites. Well, they started a nice warm fire in their defense and invited us to join them.   A very friendly bunch. It was a group of about 8 friendly hikers, including one single girl with her dog, several younger guys, and several older guys. Over dinner around the fire we learned that where we camped last night was called ""hobo island."" Allegedly there is a $250 fine if you camp there. Oh well. The most interesting one didn't stay though. His name was giggles. We met him at the NOC and hoped we would run into him again because he had a good vibe. He is from Kansas City, and worked at a good restaurant called ""Room 39"" which apparently serves farm to table food. We will check it out if we pass through there. He passed us a few miles into the climb. We joked he had jet packs. Later we found out he was fueled by alcohol. We saw him pull a six pack out of his pack. And we are trying to cut weight... We passed him unknowingly because he had stopped to visit at a shelter that we passed up. He showed up again at the campsite, visited awhile, and then decided when it was already dark out that he didn't feel like setting up his tent (it's raining) so he attached an umbrella oto his pack, put on his headlamp, and walked off into the darkness. We hope we cross paths again.","The NOC
",Locust Cove Gap,"Apr 11, Mon",10.50
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527675,"We got a bit of a late start today because of the rain. With it being wet outside, we had trouble leaving our tent. However when we finally mustered up the willpower to pack up, we were sure glad for one of the features of our tent...the ""dry pitch"" feature. We can pitch the rain fly and the footprint without the tent so we can be dry and set up the tent. We used it in reverse and took everything down inside the rain fly and then took that down last and we stayed very dry! 
 Our goal this morning was Fontana Dam or bust! We knew it was a lot of miles to attempt in one day (17+), but we were determined to get there for a hot meal and laundry! Never underestimate the power of thru hikers looking forward to a nice hot shower and clean clothes! About 5 miles in, we still felt reasonably sure we could continue to Fontana Dam. Mid afternoon however, when we realized we still needed to hike about 10 miles to make Fontana Dam, it began to seem like an impossible task. One of us shed a few tears at the thought of not doing laundry for another week. Instead zig giving up, we decided to hike really fast! We passed the last shelter before Fontana Dam at 4:45 PM. We knew we needed to go about 5.5 miles. There was a really tall mountain that had to be climbed, and we did it. Got to the top and saw some great views of the dam. We called the hotel and found out that there was a shuttle if we finished by 8:00. We practically jogged down the mountain and made it by 7:45! Too bad, there was no cell service to call for the shuttle. Heart brake. We had to walk two more miles uphill to get to the hotel! And to add insult to injury, we later found out that there was a phone box at the base of the mountain.
Whew...is all we can say after today! What a day for us! It was our longest day yet with tough terrain and we finished up with a two mile ""off trail"" for a total of over 19 miles! The quote of the day was from a guy who stopped his car at a road crossing called Stecoah gap to visit with thru hikers while we were eating lunch. He gave us celery (random, but we used it to convey peanut butter into our bellies) and then told us that he thru hiked in 2013. His quote was ""80% of people who quit hiking do it between the NOC (where we started yesterday) and Fontana dam (where we ended today) because of how difficult the terrain is."" Most people take 3 days to cover it, but we were highly motivated to get to the laundry mat at the Fontana lodge and finished in two days.
 He most difficult section of terrain is a section of the trail which is reportedly one of the steepest sections of the entire trail according to some hikers we spoke to earlier. It is called ""Jacob's Ladder"". We were nervous about that section all day until we passed some hikers who informed us that we had already hiked it. Lol...it really wasn't that steep to us. Long day and a hotel bed well deserved.","Locust Cove Gap

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527774,"Our second zero day. After 125 miles since our last off day and 10 days on the trail, it was time for a day off. We decided to give our legs a rest and enjoy the resort lifestyle for a day. The Fontana Dam Resort is gorgeous and we couldn't resist! Plus they offered us a hiker rate  We caught up on laundry, played some mini golf (he won for those who are curious), ate ate ate, and had a nice day at the foot of the Smokies! Tried to catch up on our memorizing some too. Yikes we are behind!
 Speaking of laundry, we are learning from our mistakes. For instance, when you wash your stinky clothes with your even stickier socks, none of them really come out that fresh... Next time, we will do some prewashing of the dirtier stuff in a sink before doing our load of laundry.
 While at the lodge today we met someone named ""popeye"" who started on March 27. What a character! Hopefully we cross paths on the trail.","Fontana Dam
",Off Trail,"Apr 13, Wed",0
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528633,"Today it was time to hit the trail again. We caught a $3/person shuttle down to the trail from the lodge. We noticed that several of the hikers didn't pay. Around the fire later we found out that one of the guys (Mr Fabulous) had reserved a hotel room. He lamented that three others had joined him in his room (and they committed to helping cover the room) and then none of them paid him! Not sure if there is a moral to that story or not. Not even sure if it is a reflection on hikers or just a reflection of our generation. In either case, the shuttle driver told us that lots of people were quitting at the dam, which confirmed rumors we had heard earlier from people along the trail. We caught the shuttle about 11:30 which spelled a late start for the day. The hike was a tough climb from a low starting elevation all the way to the top of the Smokies. We (he) carried 7 days of food for 2 people which translated into a 60lb pack, so we moved slow and got to a camp site close to dark.
 Along the way, we caught a few spots with decent cell phone service. Knowing it was spotty in the mountains, we called a few places and arranged to purchase some lighter weight gear. Neither of us knew enough about long distance hiking to buy ultra light gear without seeing some of it in action. We also knew that for the winter our gear was going to be heavier regardless just to keep us warm. Our plan was to optimize our gear as we went along. After being on the trail for several weeks, we have seen some of the pitfalls of people who thought they didnt need a warm sleeping bag, decided they didn't need pants, etc. We didn't meet him, but we heard about the guy who failed his BAR exam and showed up at the trailhead in only dress clothes. That's the extreme example, we suppose he could have used his tie to hang food (if he had any). We also saw some really cool packs, tents, etc that aren't carried in outfitters like REI. We landed on hyperlite 3400 backpacks (waterproof, 2 lbs) and a tarp tent (uses hiking poles instead of its own tent poles to save weight (2 lbs).
At camp, we saw a moose! Normally they are only in the NorthEastern sections of the trail, but we saw one. Well actually that was just someone's trail name. Seemed appropriate though. He was a former truck driver of 22 years. Tough on the outside but really a gentle type once you got to know him. We talked to him on and off as we climbed the mountains because he took lots of breaks and we made lots of calls.
 The Smokies have a rule that you have to stay in shelters. If the shelters are full, then you have to camp near them. We have until now avoided these areas because it's our honeymoon (and there is something called Noro virus that is easily spread in those areas but makes your life miserable several days with vomiting and diarrhrea). The campsite we stopped at did not have a shelter, which guarantees we could use our tent. Another thing we have been trying to avoid which is common at the shelters is the pot smoker crowd. As we gathered around the nearby fire ring for dinner with fellow campers, there was no avoiding it. Strange how careful people are to not share foods, not shake hands, etc. to avoid catching Noro, but then they pass around their smokes! Our guess is that this is the primary mode of transmitting the virus along the trail.","Fontana Dam
",Birch Spring Gap,"Apr 14, Thu",7.40
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528635,"Today was a new day for all of the nature lovers on the trail. Instead of the ground being covered in dead leaves, green shoots were breaking through with little white flowers. As the morning progressed, the sun made them open, revealing a beautiful light purple interior. Fields of these covered the ground! 
 Within our first mile we hit our third state, Tenessee! The Appalachian trail straddles the North Carolina Tenessee border for a couple hundred miles (basically until we get near Virginia). Unfortunately, nothing marked our entry into the magnificent new state. Despite the lack of fanfare, we were still thrilled to have made it (sure we had no idea that we did make it until a reviewing our progress later lol). 
 Around lunchtime, we decided to have some delicious bagels! Lunch is filled with options on the trail. We try to have some type of bread, either bagels, tortillas, flat breads, (any that won't get squashed in our packs). We use the bread to then convey some type of protein (peanut butter, tuna packets, etc.). Our favorite recipe is to take a packet of chicken meat (they sell it near the canned tuna, bags weigh less then cans), and mix in taco seasoning. Yum! He decided it would be fun to experiment with the other meats in that section, things like herring and anchovies. At the hiker box in Fontana, he had scored a free can of sardines in hot sauce. Yum? Unfortunately, no. YUCK!!!! Why would they sell fish bait in the human section. We are pretty sure that every bear in the park was drawn to that stinky rotten fish. Gross. Folks, these things are not like Pringles. Very easy to stop after just one bite.
We wanted to get a lot of miles in today to make up for yesterday. We like to hit at least 10 miles per day, preferably 15. The rules in the national park requiring us to stay near shelters limit our options as well. Today we could either go 11 miles to Spence field or 17 miles to Derrick Knob. We made it to Spence by early afternoon, and had plenty of energy to continue on for a long day... 
As we left Spence, we ran into a guy who we had been crossing paths with on and off through the day. He had started at Fontana dam (8 miles before us!) and was moving fast. We just assumed we would never see him again but when we went about a mile further uphill he came back and said it looked treacherous so he decided to turn around. We had already climbed a small mountain and couldn't imagine giving up that mile, so we pushed on despite the ominous warning. It was a steep climb up to a place called ""Rocky Top"" in Tennessee. It was a perfectly clear day- there was no smog, or smoke, or telephone service up on that mountain. Rocky top will never be home sweet home for us...
After getting down the mountain, we kept thinking we were really close to camp, but we were really 4 miles away. They seemed to last an eternity. Hungry again, exhausted, we fumbled into a very full camp. The quote of the day came from mr fabulous, who said, ""I looked at my journal for the last two weeks and all of the entries were about food."" Dinner was delicious, chased down with some hot chocolate. What really made that dinner special was the other achievement of the day, we were now officially under 2000 miles to the finish line (sleeping at mile marker 1,999.8)! What a great day.","Birch Spring Gap
",Derrick Knob Shelter,"Apr 15, Fri",17.20
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528637,"Today we got up early and packed up to go...we then however sat and ate breakfast and chatted with another hiker named Silly Moose. He is a section hiker because he starts his work at summer camp in a few months. He got his name last year because he saw several moose during his section hike. We really enjoyed visiting with him, but we did end up getting on the trail a tad later than planned.
As we were hiking along the trail, we could hear this loud contagious laughter. It seemed as though whomever we heard was clearly enjoying something. As we got closer, there were three thru hikers discussing a plan for a reality tv show they had and laughing hysterically...the laughter we could hear from a distance was from Mermaid. We chatted for a few minutes and we were on our way again. We passed another hiker who asked us if we heard the cyote pups and he pointed the direction of Mermaid. We chuckled and told him we though he might be hearing Mermaid's laughter! If she didn't already have a trail name, she could have earned one from this! Later when we saw her at lunch we told her of our encounter and we were greeted with more contagious laughter! 
 We have been on the lookout during our time on the trail for any sign of animal wildlife, and today we had our first experience! There was a large whitetail dear on the trail. It, of course, hopped off when it saw us, but it sure was beautiful! 
During our hike today, the area around us changed drastically! We found ourselves amongst hundreds of fir trees! We named the area ""Christmas Tree Forest"". It smelled amazing. She kept stopping and picking up needles to sniff them! We decided today that perhaps we will go to a cut your own Christmas tree farm this year for a tree! The Christmas tree forest lasted our entire hike today. As we were hiking through the forest, we were stopped by a couple who exclaimed ""You're the hitched hikers! We follow you on trail journals!"" It was so fun for us to meet people who have been reading our story! There names are Bulldog and Looney! They were so friendly and we enjoyed chatting with them for a bit! 
 The goal for today was to hit Clingaman's Dome! It is the highest point on the entire trail and the high point of Tennessee! When we got there, we went down to the gift shop and enjoyed lunch on the lawn while the gift shop employees let us charge our phones. The gift shop had a few snacks, one of which was apple butter for $7. We splurged and between the two of us we drank the entire jar! It tasted like delicious apple sauce with cinnamon! Definitely worth the price! Popeye was at Clingmans dome too. We think maybe a better trailname for him would be pickles because he got a jar of pickles from the gift store and ate the whole jar! After lunch, we went back up the hill and climbed the tower on top of Clingaman's Dome. The view was incredible! We were told the visibility was 100 miles today! It is very rare for it to be so clear! We were truly blessed with an amazing view! On the way up, we ran into a couple, Sue and Ron who chatted with us and took our photo! Everyone likes to know what we're doing and why. It works out for us because we love to talk! 
 As a side note, we visited with some national park workers today at the gift shop. There was talk of service animals on the trail. In the Great Smoky Mountain National Park dogs are only allowed if they are a service animal. There have been a few hikers saying their dogs are service animals and having them walk through the smokies with them. Out of this conversation we also found out that according to the ADA a minerature horse can also serve as a service animal! We think this is pretty cool! While we were at Clingaman's dome there was a little girl in a wheelchair type apparatus being towed by an alpaca! She got to be towed all the way up to the top of Clingaman's dome! We think this is pretty cool as the tower is not ADA accessible. 
 In the smokies you must have a special thru hiker permit. As a result, there are a lot of rangers patrolling the trail and making sure everyone has a permit. We stopped and chatted with a ranger today. We were told that approximately 650 thru hikers started on April 1st! We're thankful to be ahead of the crown, but we think we'll end up in this bubble after we return from a wedding were attending! 
 We ended our hike at Mt. Collins shelter. It was incredibly full! We had to go really deep into the woods to find a spot to pitch our tent. It was fun to chat with our fellow thru hikers, most of whom are heading to Gatlinburg tomorrow...which we are skipping. Today, we also hit the 200 mile mark! It was so exciting for us!","Derrick Knob Shelter
",Mt. Collins Shelter,"Apr 16, Sat",13.50
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528638,"We got off to a slow start because we were chilled at night. It was odd because it was not an especially cold night. We had gotten to the camping area late and had to camp where we could, which ended up being a moist area. We think it was just damp and cold. Regardless, we moved slowly. The hike down from Clingmans dome to Newfound gap and beyond was our favorite. We could see coming back to do a day hike or weekend backpacking trip here some day. The forest was spectacular, with large conifers and lots of moss. It almost felt like hiking through the Pacific Northwest. When we got to Newfound Gap, we saw Sue and Ron again (they aren't hiking, just vacationing). They took pictures of us and told us to go back to work and invest in 401k's so we could buy an RV like they did and travel all the time. Also while at the gap, his wifey, who is a trained nurse, attended to his heel, which had a rather spectacular blister. Her secret? A small patch of ""moleskin"" held on by a lot of blue duct tape.
After Newfound Gap, the terrain changed. Instead of walking down a mountain through a forest, we began to walk along narrow ridge lines that had drop offs of several hundred feet on either side. These walks provides some of the most spectacular views we have seen yet. At he end of the day, we stopped at mile 217.3 which is about 10% of the total trail! Not bad for less than three weeks on some of the most difficult terrain! The reward at the end of he night wasn't the statistic, though. It was the awesome campfire that some fellow hikers stoked from coals left warm the day before. We are hearing of reports of wild fires shutting down sections of the trail. Disappointing that we would find coals still burning from other campers. But it was a really nice fire.","Mt. Collins Shelter

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528640,"Today we got packed up and hit the trail pretty early. We even had time for an oatmeal breakfast before heading out! We knew it could be a long day...it was about 13 miles to the next shelter or about 20 before leaving the park. We decided to make the decision when we came to the shelter at 13 miles whether to go on. Knowing that there was a possibility of a 20 mile day we wanted to get an early start! While packing up, we were chatting with some section hikers from Illinois. They realized that they had too much food and gave us an extra mountain house macaroni and cheese dehydrated meal. WOW. That was probably the best Mac and cheese we have ever eaten. Hard to believe it was dehydrated. We purchased dehydrated meals from Mountain House, Alpine Aire, Backpackers Pantry, and Harmony House. The Mountain House recipes are by far the best. Backpackers Pantry is decent for variety. Alpine Aire needs to hire someone that knows how to mix flavors. Harmony House specializes in selling bulk dehydrated individual vegetables but also makes soup mixes. We haven't really cared much for the soup but have found that if we add them to the Alpine meals, the mix is tolerable. 
While on the trail, you become somewhat of an opportunist when there is free food. We were also talking to ""redirect"" (named because he walked 3 miles in the wrong direction one day) and he told how he spotted a banana on a bench at Clingmans dome the day before. He eyes it to see if anyone was with that banana. After a few minutes, he walked over and grabbed it. Upon reflection, he told us it reminded him of how street people behave. He is retired and well to do. We could relate. Yesterday, while hiking near Newfound gap, We saw some weekend hikers finishing up, and asked if they had any extra food. Scored a half pack of whole wheat tortillas. You would never think to do something like that off the trail, but it feels natural here for some reason.
 We got to the Cosby knob shelter at 13 miles early in the afternoon and decided to press on. While resting there, we ate a delicious meal, she took her shoes off and froze her feet in a stream to massage them, and we both got lectured indirectly by a passive aggressive hiker. He was talking to his buddy loudly so that he could be overheard, about how people shouldn't push too far in one day because they can hurt themselves. He knew we are planning to go 20 miles and we were only ones within earshot. The last 7 miles were basically downhill which made for a very easy hike. Towards the end, we called a shuttle and caught a ride into Newport, Tn to begin a side trip! A hot shower and laundry facilities were very motivating for completing those miles.
Reflecting on our time through the Smokies, we had really hoped to see a bear. While calling for a shuttle, another hiker passed us. At the pickup location, we saw him again and he told us that he had just seen a momma bear with her cub and had scared them off right before we got there! Guess that's what happens when you talk on the phone instead of enjoy the outdoors! He also told us that there was going to be a huge party at a hostel 4 miles up the trail to celebrate ""4/20"" with lots of drugs. We were thankful to be away from the trail for that day. One of our friends quipped, ""I guess that's why they call them the Smokies"". His coworkers told them that all the second hand smoke was giving us munchies. Not so! We are hungry because of the exercise! We finished the ~70 mile section of the AT thru Great Smoky Mountain National Park in 4 and a half days. Pretty good time. A ranger named Ethan told us that it takes most people 20 days just to get to the entrance to the park, and here we had them almost finished by then. This was encouraging for us. Now we are off the trail for a few days to go to a wedding. Update: we did see bears in Cades cove and enjoyed Dollywood! See you next week!","Peck's Corner Shelter

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529666,"While we were away we closed on our first home as a married couple! We purchased the ""Stratospire 2"" from tarptents.com! It is a roomy two person tent that uses trekking poles instead of tent poles to save weight. Speaking of saving weight, our combined gear now weighs just 29 pounds (down from about 57 at the start)! We swapped out our packs, tent, sleeping bag (don't worry, our new double bag, the Nemo tango duo, is just as comfy as the King Solomon, just not as warm), cookware, and left a lot of stuff like cold weather gear home. With packs under 15 pounds, we are now ultralight! In the bible, the book of Hebrews tells us that since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses (people who have lived their lives faihfully as witnesses to the fact that a life of faith can be lived), we too should lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so close, and run the race set before us with endurance, looking to Jesus, the author of our faith. The author of Hebrews is using a metaphor of a race as a picture of our lives. Churches are good at emphasizing the need for people to lay aside sin. Sins are like breaking the rules in any race (say catching an uber to the finish line) and can disqualify you. But less often do churches discuss laying aside weights. Picture a person running a half marathon and smoking a cigarette (or carrying a brick in each hand). Nothing in the rules prohibits this, but it would probably cause the runner to have a worse time. In the same way there are things in our lives that aren't against the rules, they aren't sins, but we won't live our lives well if we hold onto them. Maybe taking a travel assignment at work will take you away from church and rob you of fruitfulness? Lots of examples. We think a lot about literal weight right now because we have to carry everything with us. But there are things with spiritual weight too. It is good to consider those as well. Should I buy that house, can I honor God with my time and remain fruitful while also owning a boat or motorcycle, etc. The answers aren't straightforward and require prayer. 
 Speaking of things weighing us down, we are still hoarding food and that is pushing our pack weight way above what it should be. But we can eat our way out of that dilemma. For example, we got an awesome waffle iron as a wedding gift. While we were home for the wedding, she made him Belgium style Leige waffles. If you have never had one, they are made with yeast, not dough, have a type of lumpy sugar mixed into the batter, and taste phenomenal. We packed a few with us for the trail because they keep pretty well. 
 Today was an example of Gods provision in our lives. We were so busy this past week, we didnt even have time to update the blog. We never made any arrangements to return to the trail. All we had was a plane ticket to Greensvile Spartenburg airport in South Carolina, which is a 2 hour drive to an obscure dirt road where we needed to go. To make matters worse, none of the shuttle companies offered rides that far and there was nowhere nearby to drop off a one way rental car that would be open on Sunday. We boarded the plane dumbfounded as to how we would get back. While in line for our connecting flight, we stood next to an awesome lady who is also doing a backpacking trip this week. Her name is ""Martian"" (she works at NASA) and goes on trips with a group called fitpacking.com that helps people meet fitness goals while enjoying the outdoors. As we chatted with her, we learned that she worked with our friend who got married. She had rented a car for the day but didn't have to be anywhere for several hours. She took us to Walmart to pickup fuel and then drive us all the way to the trailhead! What a blessing. We hope God puts a blessing in her life for helping us.
 After getting dropped off, we were thoroughly exhausted. Mr Moose was at the gap and said hi to us which made us happy, felt we were right where we left off. He must have taken a long time in the Smokies because we last saw him over a week ago. We decided to camp near the trailhead and nap all afternoon instead of resuming our hike in earnest. Speaking of those waffles, he got hungry for one and she confessed that she had accidentally used the waffle bag to store her butt wipes (used). At least we are responsible hikers. There are lots of used butt wipes that we see daily along the trail. It was rather unfortunate, but as she was peeing, she fell on nettles and got a nice rash. She tried wiping them down and in her dazed state, confused the garbage bag for the waffle bag. We now have two garbage bags... Those nettles hurt so bad and they left big welts!

Also, it was about 8 miles of uphill terrain. We decided to take it easy so we started around 10:15am. We passed a beautiful waterfall before our climb back into the high altitude area where there are almost no rivers, streams, or waterfalls. In fact, the last time we saw a waterfall was leaving Franklin and the only other time was our first day hiking in Georgia! Shortly after, we passed under I40 and began our ascent back up into the mountains (the interstate was built in a low elevation pass just outside of the Smokie Mountain National Park). The climb started out steep and eventually flattened to a comfortable uphill hike. Returning to the trail after a week away was kind of like visiting an old friend you hadn't seen for awhile. They look the same, yet different. The forest now has new types of flowers, greenery is about a foot tall on the floor of the forest, trees mostly have leaves, and it was probably our warmest day yet (in the 80's F).  We met several hikers today. Since we have been off the trail for a while, there were mostly new faces, with a few folks we left in the dust weeks ago who were starting to find their groove. One lady who was new to us yesterday had met up with her husband for a week. When we saw her yesterday, she was walking her dog, wearing a service animal vest, out of the national park. Today, the dog wasn't wearing the device animal vest, but instead was bugging us for food. A ranger told us that lots of people lie about their pets being service animals so they can bring them with in places they are not allowed. We also met some world class people, one named skooch who we had heard about from moose and were hoping to meet. She got her name because she skooches her way down rocky parts of the trail to be safe and doesn't mind wearing out her pants in the process. We also met several Canadians about our age. We decided to stealth camp tonight. That just means we found a place down the trail away from the shelters and designated camp sites. This meant we had to pack enough water for the night, morning, and into the following day. We found by accident a special place according to a sign that was well off the trail called Hawks Roost just before brown gap.","State line Branch

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530259,"Today we got started at 0915...after nearly 11 hours of sleep! We must have needed to catch up! We knew the day held a pretty good climb and we started with a lot of energy! We walked for a while and didn't see anyone...but then we heard some hikers who were starting to get close to us. We slowed down to let them by and one of them was Giggles! We thought he would have been long gone by now! He said Gatlinburg sucked him in. It was so good to see familiar faces! As we chatted with Giggles and Sneaky Pete, we learned that three hikers died while in Gatlinburg. One from a heart attack and the other two were a couple who died in a hot tub. We later found out the couple who died in the hot tub were not hikers and that rumors can certainly spread on the trail. Our prayers are with those who lost their loved ones. 
We continued our climb to Max Patch. The view from the top is definitely worth the climb! We enjoyed our lunch with a view! We saw a lot of people who came up for the afternoon and parked at the parking lot on top and don't have to climb all the way up. We also saw a lot of fun day hikers in the area. We did not however see many thru hikers today. We only saw Tonto and Brewha that we met yesterday in addition to Giggles and Sneaky Pete. 
After lunch we began our trek down. Boy were we exhausted! We just couldn't seem to get in our groove. We took far too many breaks and felt like we were making very little progress. We tried eating snacks but nothing helped. Finally around 5 PM we decided to bust out our cookware and make a hot dinner. That certainly did the trick, we both had renewed energy after that. In fact, we kept hiking later than usual. We ended up running out of daylight before we ran out of energy. We hiked down to Big Rock Spring and camped nearby. 
As we were eating dinner we noticed some orange light atop several mountains in the distance. We realized it was the fire that's burning just beyond Hot Springs. It was a somber feeling going to sleep surrounded by forest fires. We prayed that we would be safe from the fires and prayed for those who are working to contain them.","Brown Gap

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530260,"We headed out in the morning with one thing on our minds...lunch in Hot Springs! We scurried on our way know that we had less than 10 miles to hike. The trail was empty on the way! We ran in to two men who were heading opposite of us to do some trail and shelter maintenance and that was it. The hike was fairly easy and we made our way into Hot Springs around 1 PM. We could smell the wild fires for quite some time before we got into town. 
 Our first order of business once in town was to find somewhere to eat lunch. We settled on the Spring Creek Tavern. On the window they had advertised the ""AT Burger"". He was up for a challenge so he ordered it. It was huge! Even with a hungry hiker appetite, he couldn't finish it. 

 After lunch we needed to find somewhere to stay...apparently we weren't the only ones. The first few places we stopped at were full. After a lot of walking, we finally found a motel that had a room available. We were thankful for a hot shower (especially her!). 
The town of Hot Springs is very small, you can walk the entire town in less than 20 minutes. While were waiting for our laundry we walked to get ice cream. Then we walked to resupply at the local Dollar General. Just before we got there we ran into Giggles and a hiker we had never met before names JT. We assumed that was his real name and commented that he didn't have a trail name yet. He explained that JT was in fact his trail name. His name is Jim and when he would introduce himself people couldn't tell if he was saying Jim or Tim so they would ask ""J or T?"" So now he goes by JT. As we chatted with him he offered us ice cream. Of course we couldn't say no, so we each had our second ice cream of the day. Talk about a sugar overload! We explained to JT that we needed to get on our way to go get our laundry switched and his response was ""I don't think it's worth it to do laundry, I'm just going to get dirty again."" For now, we are appreciating clean clothes while we can! 

 After laundry we finished our resupply at The Hillbilly Market. They had ice cream and milkshakes, so naturally we got a strawberry milkshake to share. We don't need dessert for at least a week! Once we weren't too full from our afternoon desserts we went to find some dinner. We settled on the Smoky Mountain Diner. The menu looked very tasty! Not too long after we sat down, we found out that they were out of a lot of different menu items and we only had a few things to choose from. We were a little disappointed but still found things to order from the menu. 

 After dinner we ran into Scooch. She was on her way to the river where there was a big hiker party happening. She invited us to come along. We politely declined and went to our motel. We were so tired! We stayed awake until 9:30...at least we stayed awake past ""hiker midnight""!","Big Rock Spring
","Hot Springs, North Carolina","Apr 27, Wed",9.10
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530874,"We started our day off with a delicious breakfast from the Smoky Mountain Diner. This time they had lots of food, which was good because we ate 3 breakfasts between us. Have we mentioned that it is fun to be on the all you can eat diet? There were lots of other hikers having breakfast. We sat at a table next to Skooch and chatted a bit. Saw giggles and his crew as well. We invited JT to join us. He is an aspiring hammered dulcimer player looking to make a career out of music. We really hope he is successful. We would go watch him in concert some day. His favorite dulcimer artist is the late Rich Mullins and he can play every one of his songs. If you are looking for a hammered dulcimer player for your band, sign our guest book asking for his contact info, we can send it to you. Other than the unpleasant hiker aroma, it was a great breakfast. 
 On our way back to our hotel we passed Moose! We had been hoping to see him. A couple weeks ago he mentioned how much he likes horehound candy. We saw it in a store and picked it up in case we crossed paths with him. We told him we had something for him. ""Do I smoke it or eat it?"" he asked. We told him he could use it however he wanted to... we think he ate it...
We learned that the party at the river last night got pretty wild despite the rain. The secret? Free Beer! Apparently, the hot springs resort was throwing out all of last seasons beer in their dumpster. Hikers can be opportunists you know. One of the guys throwing the beer out heard an ouch and realized there were people in the dumpster! We didn't know whether to believe it or not but when we ran into ironman on the trail, he admitted that he lost his cell phone while in dumpster.
 Due to the wild fires, we had to miss a small section of the trail (about 14 miles). Bluff mountain outfitters was giving all of the hikers free rides around the section of trail that was closed. We tried to tip them but they wouldn't accept it. They said it wasn't our fault we were caught in the natural disaster. They were awesome! As we all disembarked, they told us that the number one thing people leave in the shuttles is their trekking poles. Ironic because the night before, he left his poles in the hotel lobby while checking in. Luckily, we were able to get them this morning when we realized they were missing.
 We got to the trail by 10:30 this morning which wasn't bad at all! A little while in, we decided to stop and make some adjustments to our packs. Looking at our clutter as he passed, Giggles (who has more food than both of us combined!), suggested we could fit everything in our packs better if we threw some of it off a nearby cliff. Shortly after, one of our sleeping pads rolled down the mountain. Oops! Don't worry we didn't litter...
The hiking today was spectacular. First we climbed a mountain for about 7 miles. Then we saw some cliffs that were gorgeous. We sat on one to eat lots of snacks. The trail followed a narrow ridge that offered stunning panoramas that we failed to capture with our cameras (despite our best attempts). She landed wrong on one step and twisted her knee a little. Don't worry, she is fine, but it was a sobering reminder that we are always one misstep away from ending our hike. We heard that one in four couples leaves the trail due to one of the people getting injured. Finally, we hiked up a bluff to camp for the night. We setup our tent next to pantry, a guy hiking with his dog, chatted a bit, and hit the sack.","Allen Gap

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530875,"This morning we woke up to two wonderful months of marriage! Time sure flies when you are having fun. With thunderstorms rolling in for the weekend and an anniversary to celebrate, we decided to get off the trail for a few days. We plan to hit the Biltmore in Asheville and go to church for the first time in over a month! As of today, we have only slept in our own bed in Texas 21 nights together. Compare that with 1 night apart (due to our friends wedding), 5 nights at friends houses, 17 nights in a tent, and by the end of this weekend, 19 nights in hotels! 
 On the trail, we hiked most of the way with Dancing Moose (the third moose we have met on the trail). He is a quick hiker, very friendly, seems to have done lots of research, etc. He has lots of knowledge, for example, he told us that ritz crackers have more calories per oz then tortillas, and he explained the pitfalls of poptart breakfasts. We enjoyed walking with him. It was an easy downhill walk to a gap where a shuttle was waiting for us.
 We shared a shuttle with ""Detained"", a Canadian hiker who initially was detained by our wonderful immigration system because they thought she was trying to immigrate to the United States. Her son, ""Denied"", also had similar issues trying to enter the country. Lots of foreign hikers have difficulties. They ultimately were granted a four month visa which really isnt long enough to complete the trail. Her son is speeding along and she is using shuttles to stay close to him.
 Our shuttle took us to Johnson City, where credit points allowed us to stay free in a beautiful Marriott. We celebrated 2 months of bliss over milkshakes at Fuddruckers... (Don't judge us! We had a late lunch and it was the only thing in walking distance.)","Big Butt
","Devil Fork Gap, Off Trail","Apr 29, Fri",7.10
The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531646,"We had to take off a few days for personal reasons, but hit the trail again today. We decided to make up the section of the trail that we missed last week due to the wild fire North of Hot Springs rather than leaving behind 15 miles. Ironically, the Conservancy ruled that due to the fire, the shuttle miles counted towards completing a thru hike. We decided instead to try to pass every white blaze! Call us purists. In a conversation with our shuttle driver, who has hiked the AT, the PCT and part of the CDT, we learned some of the differences in trail culture among the big 3 trails in the US. For the Appalachian Trail, people tend to want to pass every white blaze marking the actual trail. For the PCT (Pacific Crest Trail), the goal is a continuous foot path from Mexico to Canada. Hikers don't care as much whether they are on the actual trail or just a nearby road (when fires, etc. force you off). On the CDT (Continental Divide Trail), you really can ""hike your own hike"", with several official starting and ending points and often nothing more then an imaginary line on a map and your GPS/compass to guide you through miles of remote wilderness.
 Since we had done both the section leading up to hot springs and the one following Allen Gap, there was no reason to carry our hiking backpacks. We did what hikers call ""slackpacking."" Basically, we hired a shuttle driver to bring us to one side, and then pick us up on the other. This allowed us to carry just one light day pack with some food and water. Now this is hiking! Some people try to finish the entire Appalachian trail this way. There is only really one 100 mile section in Main where you can't make slackpacking work, but it would get expensive fast. The shuttle cost us $142 and the hotel was another $55 each night. Plus, when you slackpack, there is usually a restaurant to eat at. Definitely a treat for us, but not something we can do every day.  Since we had the luxury of slackpacking, we chose to walk this section of the trail from the North to the South (opposite our normal hiking direction). We did this for several reasons- cell phone service was sketchy at the drop-off location which would have made it difficult to get a pickup, there was a restaurant at the end, it was mostly downhill which made for a more enjoyable hike, and most importantly, it allowed us to get a sense of how many Northbound hikers there are. Since we were walking against the flow of traffic, we decided to count each person walking by. From ~10AM when we were dropped off until ~6:45PM when we finished our very leisurely stroll, we passed 82 hikers in a span of less than 15 miles! The hike also allowed us to see first hand the extent of damage from the forest fire. The name of the fire was ""the silvermine fire"", and it gobbled up about 6000 acres of the forest. Fortunately, in the sections where the trail passed, mostly just the undergrowth was burnt. The canopy of the trees, along with nice green leaves, were all still very intact. There was a fire tower on a side trail at the top of ""rich mountain."" We decided to climb up it to see the forest fire damage. To our surprise, there was little evidence of fire damage. All we saw were green healthy trees. From the town there are a few sections visibly on neighboring hills where the trees were burnt up as well. The trail finished with a section called ""lovers leap."" Steep and rocky, we descended down to a path along the French Broad River that lead us into town and back to our favorite restaurant, the Smokey Mountain Diner. Our waitress was so kind as to let us use her phone to call our shuttle driver for our pickup. We enjoyed a delicious pizza while we waited. 
Our shuttle driver picked us up and brought us back to Uncle Johnnie's Hostel at Nolichucky in Erwin for our second night there. We are staying in a comfortable private cabin with a space heater. We're enjoying a cozy night here as the temperature should drop pretty low tonight.","Allen Gap

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531656,"We got a shuttle from Uncle Johnnie's to Devil's Fork Gap to start where we left off last Friday. Thank You Hiker Shuttles for your service! We have really appreciated your flexibility and availability to meet our needs these last few days! 
 Our packs were fully loaded and we decided that we would hike as far as our legs would take us. We knew that we had a four mile uphill climb to start the day and we simply ""took it easy"" and took breaks as needed. When you're off the trail for a few days it takes a little bit to get back into the swing of things! We are hoping to be back up to our 15-20 miles days sometime next week. We aren't at all worried about our pace, but we probably won't make it to ""Trail Days"" (possibly be there by Sunday). ""Trail Days"" is an annual festival for hikers in Damascus Virginia that will be taking place all next weekend. There is a parade and numerous festivities. We have heard that many hikers go up to Damascus for the festival and then end their hike. 
 We knew that the weather today was not going to be in our favor. It was supposed to be cold and rainy, so our rain gear was stashed near the top of our packs. We weren't even on the trail 30 minutes when it started to rain. We stopped and put our rain gear on because nothing is more miserable than being cold and wet. It wasn't a heavy rain thankfully. We stayed warm and dry with our gear!
 Our climb took us to an elevation of about 4500 feet today. The top was called ""Frozen Knob"". It was very appropriately named, as soon as we got up there it started to snow. It was the first snow flurry we've seen on the trail. Although we were not up there long enough to see if the snow stuck, it sure was beautiful. It was pretty much all down hill after the knob. 
 We continued our trek down to Sam's Gap where we encountered trail magic! It was so unexpected on a Thursday afternoon. We got cookies and sunflower seeds and some very important weather information. The man was telling us that thunder and lightening storms are expected tonight and that we shouldn't go too high up the mountain. He also told us that the temperature was supposed to drop near freezing. That was all we needed to hear! We called Mother Marion, who we found in the conservancy guide and it just so happened that she and her husband had space in their home and could host us for the night. Her husband Frank came to pick us up at Sam's Gap and we were so thankful! When we got to their home we were greeted by Mother Marion with a big hug! She and her husband were so hospitable to us. They made us dinner and we even had cake for dessert! We are so thankful to have found such a wonderful family to help us out when the weather was going to be bad! We stayed in a very comfortable private room in the upstairs of their home. The bed even had two homemade quilts on it to keep us nice and cozy. We had a private bathroom with a nice hot shower as well! I do believe we will stay very comfortable tonight! The family keeps 5 chickens, 3 real dogs, one barking cat (i.e. a yorkie), and 1 real cat. As animal lovers, we fit right in. They fed each real dog a raw egg with their dog food. When you have 5 hens, you have lots of eggs. Apparently, Marian developed some health issues about 15 years ago and has to stay home most of the time. Now she takes care of seniors at her old church in Vermont with a card ministry, paints, quilts, takes in hikers, and has lots of pets for company. Breakfast in the morning of course will involve eggs... We might even slackpack tomorrow so we can stay here again!","Devil's Fork Gap

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531748,"This morning we started out with a plate of... scrambled eggs! Delicious! Supposedly the free range chicken eggs are healthier too. We decided to take another light day to get a little more rest before hitting the trail again in earnest. Knowing we only had 6.5 downhill miles ahead of us, we spent the morning relaxing at Mother Marian's while it warmed up. We perused several books on raising chickens. Maybe someday we will raise a few of our own. The big excitement of the morning was when Miss Kitty (the cat) decided to sleep in Max's dog bed (the Cocker Spaniel). Rather than picking a fight, Max slept in Oscar's (the chow retriever mix) much larger dog bed. Oscar didn't know what to do, so he stood there and barked. This of course led to Miss Buttons (the Yorkie) joining in the chorus. Meanwhile, Tally (the black lab), oblivious to the unfolding drama in the family room, stood guard over the chickens from his perch near the back door. Eventually, Oscar just laid down next to Max and Miss Buttons went back to barking at squirrels outside.  We started hiking around 2:30PM and again did a reverse hike. The weather forecast showed thunderstorms at 5PM so we took our raingear and a few snacks. We didn't even carry water bottles because the hike was so short. We did carry a shovel to bury the results of any potential bathroom breaks. We had heard that a lot of people get rid of their shovels. In fact, we heard that Miss Janet (a lady famous in the trail community for her trail magic- we haven't met her yet although we have seen her van) made a wind chime out of them just to make a statement that people need to practice Leave no Trace. If you are picturing thousands of miles of wilderness untainted by man, you would be surprised to learn that we probably have not yet gone one single day without seeing toilet paper strewn across the ground somewhere along the trail. Often, we even see it hanging in the branches of nearby bushes. Why hikers do that right near the trail is beyond us, especially when shovels are so cheap and easy to use. We did see one shovel at an outfitter that wasn't cheap. Made of titanium and weighing 0.6oz, it was the ultimate lightweight excrement sequestration device. Of course it cost $20 which seemed ridiculous when a plastic shovel only costs a few bucks. Rather than purchasing one, we opted to see if people really abandon their shovels along the trail. Sure enough, we came across a beautiful blue one while on the trail recently. We are grateful for the find but wish the person who abandoned it would have instead chosen to use it daily. The hike downhill was splendid. Instead of building up for more rain, the sun came out, eventually forcing us to shed layers. The top of the bald we started on had splendid 360 degree views, along with plenty of snow on the ground to remind us that we made a great decision staying indoors last night. We didn't see a lot of hikers on the way down, which surprised us. We made it back to Sam's Gap by 5:45 and got a ride back to Mother Marian's for supper. Tonight's menu included pork roast, broccoli, potatoes, gravy, and of course dessert. Brownies with peanut butter swirled in. Yum! We were happy to help with the cooking and cleaning because Marian wasn't feeling well.","Big Bald

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532306,"Today after a hearty breakfast made by Mother Marian, we set out for an ambitious day. We planned on going all the way to the area of Uncle Johhny's. About 18 miles in total. We started off with a really great pace! There was mud everywhere and we were very careful about where we stepped so we wouldn't fall. It was a beautiful hike! We even ran into a large group of day hikers from the local hiking club. We enjoyed chatting with a few of them. 
On our way down from Little Bald somewhere between mile 327 and 328 we had little accident. She took a good spill and heard a loud pop from her left ankle (she was quick to point out that at least it wasn't her driving foot). To make matters worse, there was no mud to blame her clumsiness on. She was even wearing high top supportive boots as she has a history of breaking her ankle during a similar incident on Mt. Rainer. She was thankful also that she didn't injure the weak ankle as well. 
Full of ambition...and Aleve...she decided to hop all the way to Spivey Gap. Thankfully hopping was unnecessary as she was able to put slight pressure on her foot and hobble down to the gap. She of course has the most Amazing Husband who carried her pack four miles to make the trek more manageable for her. He has earned the trail name ""Sherpa"". This is not the first time he's carried her pack either...he also carried the last of the way to Neel Gap as well. Again, she has the Best Husband ever! 
Once they had cell service they contacted the Hiker Shuttles to ask for their assistance. They advised that Spivey Gap was the closest place for a pickup. When we reached the gap, we unfortunately did not have cell service so we weren't able to call Hiker Shuttles for a ride. Stuck at a gap, we prayed that God would provide a ride. Shortly after, a man that was walking his dog offered us a ride into Erwin! God is so good and we are so thankful! He dropped us off at the Super 8 where she was able to get some ice on her ankle and elevate it. The purple color had already set in and she was well on her way to having a cankle.","Big Bald

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534164,"Yesterday we finished a drive back from a week of recuperation at the beach in Florida. Today we are getting back on the trail. Due to her ankle injury, she is going to be slack packing him until her injury heals. Basically, he will be doing day hikes. Her ankle is still bruised, swollen, and painful. She tried walking a mile on flat ground and found it painful, so she's going to recover for now. This however changes our trail life! Since we will be slackpacking, we decided to upgrade our house, bed, and our kitchen. We stopped in at the Coleman store because we had called them and knew they had an awesome deal on a four person tent. We got a tent for $30 that is normally $100. We feel like that's a steal! While we were there, we saw a propane grill that also had a burner for $60 marked down from $100. Also a great deal! We bought that as well as the griddle that you can swap out the grill grate for. We see pancakes and French toast and maybe even grilled cheese on the menu in the coming weeks. After we made our purchases, we set out to the campground she found online. The Rock Creek Recreation Center. Because we have the America the Beautiful Pass, our tent site was only $6 a night and there are hot showers! We are going to stay here for three nights. It is a great park with lots of hiking trails and because it's off season, it's very quiet. Before we left, we decided to make a quick grilled cheese lunch! It was so tasty! Thank you Mom L.K. for sending us off with a cooler of food!  Next she dropped him off at Spivey Gap and planned to pick him up at Chestoa Bridge at Nolichucky in a few hours. He took nothing with him as today's hike will be fairly short. After she dropped him off she set off for the local Walmart to do a little grocery shopping.  She picked him up after just 3 hours and 20 minutes on the trail! Awesome timing if you ask us! We headed back to our campsite which was already set up and began to prepare dinner. She made a salad while he grilled steaks! We are sure enjoying this luxurious trail lifestyle...it's a little different than dehydrated meals and cliff bars for sure!","Spivey Gap

There was trail magic at the gap where he set off from. A trail angel named Rob Byrd was there. He had a big white van with Casper on the side. When asked if he was a former thru hiker he told us ""No, and I think y'all are nuts!"" He told us he used to run a hostel and liked to help hikers. When he retired he moved somewhere that he could be near the trail to do trail magic daily at various gaps. He had a lot of stories about the different hikers who have stayed with him throughout the years including a story from just this week about a hiker named Zing. He always asks thru hikers if they've hiked before or if they know anyone who's hiker before. Rob Bryd takes photos of all the hikers who've stayed with him. Zing stayed with him on Wednesday night. When asked if he had hiked before or if he knew any thru hikers, Zing told him that he had actually been a thru hiker in 2005 when he was 10. Rob had him look through his 2005 yearbook to see if anyone looked familiar or if he was in it. It turns out that Zing's photo was in the book and he had stayed with Rob Byrd in 2005 as well with his family! What a story!  While she was chatting with Mr. Bryd another thru hiker showed up. Her name was Prince Charming. Curious with how a woman recieved this name, she asked about it. Prince Charming earned her name by picking up a croc. She carried the croc until she found its owner. The man was so thankful to have his beloved croc back, thus he earned the name Cinderella which would make this woman Prince Charming. I love hearing how people get their trail names!  After chatting a while, she left to hit up Johnson City and find a few things. Our air mattress deflated on us last night so we decided to upgrade our bed. She found a nice replacement at Target that was on sale. It's a week of finding good deals! She also set off to find him an armband for his phone and some headphones before lunch. She also went to a used bookstore...she however didn't have any success at even looking for a book as the woman at the front desk, Helen, was so chatty she never made it past the enterance before it was time to bring Sherpa lunch. Perhaps tomorrow she will find a book.  She met up with Sherpa at Indian Grave Gap for lunch. It was nice to have lunch with him. We made old fashioned PB&J. While we were sitting there two thru hikers that we met our first week came up. They are nurses from Alaska! We really enjoyed their company. We told them our silly ankle story. They inspected her ankle and told us we were doing the right thing. They even said we were given a good brace for the injury. We hope to run into them again! After lunch she went back to camp to set up the new bed. It is an 18"" mattress so it feels ridiculously tall in our tent but it is so comfortable we don't mind! Today was a leisurely day, she even had time to call her Mom CK before picking up Sherpa in the evening. She picked him up at Chestoa Bridge and he was tired and hungry! She however dropped him off to shower before dinner and bedtime so he didn't get the tent of his sleep clothes stinky! For dinner she made grilled cheese and he made tomato soup!

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534772,"Today was a reverse hike. We started at Carvers gap, a popular place for day hikes, and headed Southbound. It was fantastically beautiful. The gap was located in Roan mountain state park in Tennessee. The place is known for the bald mountain covered in rhododendrons. This is also one of the last areas in Southern Appalatia that is above 6000 feet. Unfortunately, the flowers weren't quite in bloom yet and the weather didn't allow many awesome views. The hike started near a bald spot on the mountain (where no trees grow). It was a mostly downhill day which passed through a Christmas tree forest. Near the top there were remnants of a hotel from the 1900s that straddles the North Carolina / Tennessee line. Legend has it, they painted a line down the middle of the table to let you know which state you were in. The entire state of NC was dry due to prohibition. Apparently, an old sheriff used to enforce the drinking ban right in the dining room! How many marriages would be saved if prohibition was still around? How many needless deaths due to drunk driving would be avoided? Hard to imagine that our country has such a rich and godly history that we actually at one point banned alcohol! The Bible is so wise when it says in Ephesians 5 ""So not get drunk on wine, for that is debauchery..."" Plus, we wouldn't have root beer without the temperance movement...
 As he climbed down, he ran into the travel nurses from Alaska again. It was nice to see the familiar faces. Further down the mountain, he ran into Skooch! We last saw her at Sams gap and assumed she was long gone. She told how she had hitched a ride to trail days (the annual hiking festival in Damascas, Va that we missed because of the injury) and then got a ride all the way back to hot springs where she spent several more days and then caught another ride back up to where she had left off. We exchanged numbers just in case she needed a ride now that we had a car. She also gave us an update on Moose's whereabouts... apparently he was several days ahead according to a trail register she had read.
 Meanwhile, she ran a few errands in Elizabethton and Johnson City. She had read online that there was a coffee shop in downtown Elizabethton and decided to try it. She enjoyed her coffee and lunch there. It was a quiet coffee shop, the perfect place to spend an afternoon. She was able to catch up on the journal a little bit and catch up on some reading as well! It is owned by Christians and is closed on Sunday. She will definitely come back here...hopefully Sherpa will get to experience it as well! 
 Next, she decided to venture to Johnson City and stop at the hotel we spent several nights in. We lost our gorilla pod and thought we might have left it there. A gorilla pod is a phone tripod that you can attach to anything to set up a picture. It's how we take most of our pictures of the two of us! There is not always someone nearby to capture the moment for us. When she got to the hotel and asked them, they brought it right out! She was so excited as it is difficult to find this tripod in stores. They had it labeled ""climbing equipment?"" She secretly chuckled and thanked them for saving it from two weeks ago. She was so excited to show Sherpa! Stopping at the hotel made her a little late to pick him up, but she is sure he won't mind once he sees the tripod!","Carvers Gap

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534773,"On the way to take Sherpa back to Carver's Gap, we drove through the Roan Mountain Park. It is a beautiful park and we both agree that it would be a great place to go for a vacation someday! We stopped at the gift shop briefly and picked up a nice hammock (car camping accessory). It was reasonably priced and has a bug net...she will appreciate that more than him. We can't wait for dry weather so we can enjoy the hammock at camp! 
Because it's a weekend there were a lot of people at Carver's Gap. We both got out and she walked a few feet of the trail...her ankle still won't hold up for an entire day of hiking unfortunately. We got a nice photo together and they both went on their way. 
 His hike took him by some really beautiful landscapes that for he most part were buried behind puffy white clouds. For part of the day, he hiked with a guy who had worked at oversees consulates teaching. He gave advice on visiting Patagonia, hopefully we can use it some day. He also lamented the American celebrations oversees where people bring hot dogs because they think of that as being somehow uniquely American, when almost every country in the world has hotdogs at food stands. Sherpa laughed at this as he could relate, he once got food poisoning after eating a pink colored ""hot dog"" from a street vendor in the Peruvian Andies. The guy told how when he wants to share uniquely American culture, he gives people root beer. Nowhere else in the world so people have ready access to this wonderful substance.
 After parting ways, at one point Sherpa climbed a mountain with fog so thick that he could only see a few feet. The most exciting part of the hike was getting to the sign which said ""leaving North Carolina."" From here, the trail goes into Tenessee for a short while before moving into Virginia. We have been looking forward to getting past the area where her ankle was hurt...
There was nowhere for them to meet for lunch, so she just ran errands until it was time to pick him up. She enjoyed the coffee shop so much the day before that she went back and got a coffee to go before picking him up. The weather was very rainy out, so she showed up at the meetup location with a hot chocolate for him. We are trying to only eat out about one meal a week and mostly cook for ourselves but decided that tonight is a good night to eat out because of the weather. We found a Mexican restaurant to try in Elizabethton. It was tasty and we are glad we stopped!
We're continuing to test out the rain resistance of our new tent as tonight should be rainy again. So far our new tent is holding up remarkable well we're staying warm and dry. There isn't even condensation in our tent when we wake up in the morning.","Carver's Gap

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534774,"We've decided that if possible, Sherpa will take a zero day on Sunday's so that we can go to church and spend time together. God is the center of our lives and for us, it is important to attend church when possible. Right now, we have a car and it makes attending church very easy. So today, we attended a church near our campground in Erwin. We went to the Erwin Church of Christ. They had a sign in their yard that read ""hikers welcome"" so we went. We really enjoyed the church service here. It was sure wonderful to fellowship with fellow believers and worship God. 
 we also moved campgrounds today. We left the Rock Creek campground and moved to Cardens bluff, which is closer to our hikes over the next few days. The new campsite is lakefront. Not bad for $6/night!","Off Trail

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534775,"After a leisurely morning, we did some devising so that Sherpa won't have any super long days. We decided it would be good for him to knock out a segment later in the trail and then do the segment that was next in line. Around 11:30 she dropped him off at Dennis Cove Trailhead with plans to pick him up at Shook Branch Recreational Area. This will save him from a very long day in a couple days. While he was hiking, she went back to the beautiful campsite on Lake Watauga and enjoyed the sounds of nature while reading a book. She loved her relaxing afternoon. Today she could just wait for him to call from the end of his hike as her drive was less than 5 minutes. When he was finished, she picked him up and brought him back to the campground for lunch. BLAT sandwiches! (The a is for avocado) Yum! Sherpa sure did enjoy a nice hot lunch during his break today! 
Next we decided that Sherpa could do the section from Bear Branch Road to Walnut Mountain Road. Knowing that it would be getting dark around when he finished, we decided that we would drop him off at Walnut Mountain Road (a remote dirt road) to hike southbound since she was more comfortable picking him up at Bear Branch Road at dusk. He finished around 8:20 PM and it wasn't quite dark. We were thankful...although he did have a headlamp just in case. These days, he's been hiking with just a waist pack that holds some snacks and two water bottles. He also fits his jacket in it as well...$10 well spent!
 After getting dropped off, Sherpa went the wrong direction from Walnut Mountian Road and headed northbound! Oops. There really are not very good markings at trail eads to let you know which way is North. They assume you know, which gives slack packing a challenge. He made it to over a mile before running into a hiker that was actually going Southbound and realized he had gone the wrong way. Santing to get back before dark, he jogged as much as possible. He was exhausted by the time she picked him up...and ready for dinner! 
While he was on the second leg of his hike, she ran errands and did laundry. It was a productive afternoon for her. She also got some more reading in. She's currently reading ""The Hiding Place"" by Corrie Ten Boom. It's a great book, and she would recommend it! Corrie Ten Boom is a Dutch woman who tells of her life during the Holocaust. She doesn't want to spoil the book for anyone...she just recommends reading it. 
After a long day and a late dinner they are both exhausted and ready for sleep! It will be nice to wake up next to the lake again! It sure is beautiful at this campground!","Walnut Mountain Road

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534776,"Today we had another relaxing morning. It's sure nice to be able to cook breakfast and enjoy it lakefront! This morning she made whole grain pancakes with blueberries, and also some with chocolate chips and bananas. They were delicious! Sherpa topped his chocolate chip banana pancakes with peanut butter for a little extra protein and calories to fuel his hiking. 
 We dropped him off at Walnut Mountain Road again. He headed northbound this time. She made sure he was going to correct direction before she left. We don't want him to do extra miles if we can help it! The weather was very warm today, in fact Sherpa decided to hike without his shirt until he was out of the shade. He got started at about 1:15 with plans to be to Dennis Cove around 7 PM. The hike itself was unremarkable, mostly in a tree canopy with a lot of mud, filler miles to get from the beautiful Roan area to the beautiful lake area near their camp site. The section had a wildfire just like there trail north of hot springs. A few places were charred pretty bad, but mostly the under growth was already returning to life with bigger trees completely unaffected.
 With a lot of free time, she decided to run some errands. She found a local produce stand and bought some fresh peaches. We will enjoy peach cobbler tonight cooked over a camp fire! Sherpa will be preparing it as it is his recipe. She then went back to the little coffee shop in Elizabethton, TN that she enjoyed on Friday. She got some reading in. Later she went to a couple of shoe stores to find a pair of sandals...she's been wearing crocs since she hurt her ankle as they are her only pair other than her hiking boots that she has with her. Today was a good day for both of them. 
 After picking up Sherpa, we headed back to the campground for dinner. We had dinner prepared over the fire and it was delicious. Sherpa's peach cobbler was the perfect finish to the day. We enjoyed our campfire for several hours tonight before bedtime. Some other campers were a little on the loud side and we heard another man shout at them that they were being too loud. It didn't phase them at all! Thankfully we can sleep through any noise and they didn't keep us awake!","Walnut Mountian Road

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534979,"Today she really wanted him to experience the coffee shop in Elizabethton before they were out of range so we decided to plan our hike strategically so he could go to lunch! We had a quick cereal breakfast and headed to the Wilbur Dam Road to drop him off with plans to pick him up at Shook Branch...a quick 4.4 mile hike. The morning hike was southbound back to the shook ranch recreation area near our camp site. It was basically a walk around the lake and near the dam. There were signs posted warning about bear activity. Just after crossing the dam, he heard a very large creature in the woods and didn't slow down to investigate.
 Meanwhile,. she enjoyed a book in the hammock while waiting for him. After she picked him up they headed in to Elizabethton to The Coffee Company for lunch. There were no empty tables and this sweet couple offered to share their large table with us. We got to chatting and it turns out they have a farm where they lodge A.T. hikers! We were sad that we have already passed them and didn't get a chance to stay with them. 
Their names were Mike and Peggy and they run the Cantarroso Farm! They have bees and chickens. They also do some organic gardening! We really wish we'd heard about them sooner. She remembered as she was talking to Mike and Peggy that she's seen a link to their website on the Hiker Shuttle website. What's more notable, they shared a couple bites of their dessert with us, and they even paid for our meal. Some trail magic off the trail. Thank you so much to our ""off trail"" angels Mike and Peggy for lunch, it was so nice meeting you and getting to chat with you both! We hope to come and stay at your place when she does the section she's missed so far!
 After lunch, she dropped him off at mile 447.3 on Tennessee 91. Thankfully some of these trail crossings are well marked! She plans on picking him up at 8:30 tonight! Until then she'll enjoy reading again! This lifestyle is sure enjoyable for us. We're loving getting to spend so much time with each other and with little distraction. We know that God has blessed us by granting is this sweet time together to start our marriage. We pray that God is using this time in our marriage for his glory. 
 This section of the hike was also Southbound back to the place she had dropped him off in the morning. The same forboding bear warnings were posted at the trailhead here. It said don't camp, eat, or even linger. How are hikers supposed to go 16 miles without even a break? Early in his hike, he came to a solitary tombstone. It bore the saddest epitaph imaginable, ""Lived alone, suffered alone, and died alone"". The man who had these remarkable words engraved on his headstone was named Nick Grindstaff, an orphan who had a series of unfortunate events and became a hermit living on the mountain. So sad and so unnecessary. Jesus promises rest to all who are weary and are carrying heavy burdens if they will just come to Him. (Matthew 11:28)
 Continuing through the woods, he met an older northbound hiker he had seen at the waterfall the day before. The hiker looked a bit shaken up. Chatting with him, apparently the hiker had seen a bear a couple miles back that wasn't very afraid of people and an ominous rattlesnake warning scribbled on a sleeping bag tag left on the trail. It was obvious that the hiker was ready to get away from this section. Treading carefully, Sherpa approached the area with the rattlesnake warning, but fortunately there was no snake in sight. Continuing on, he met another group of hikers. They too had seen a bear. Surely it wasn't the same one? Sherpa picked up a few rocks in case. Continuing on, he ran across some hikers setup for camping. Before he could finish warning the group, they began telling of a bear exactly matching the description given by the previous hikers about a mile away. Why camp near a bear that obviously is somewhat accustomed to people? Sherpa proceeded with extreme caution. Bears are supposed to be afraid of people. Make lots of noise so they know your approaching. He hit his trekking poles together and dragged them through the brush as he walked. Exactly where the bear was last seen, a bear came running across the trail. Only instead of running into the woods afraid like bears are supposed to, this one went about 10 feet past the trail, stopped, turned, and just stared as if to say, I dare ya to come closer. Sherpa was about 50 yards away.
 It is no secret that bears exist along the Appalatian Trail. While some old timers swear they are mythical creatures like unicorns because you can hike for years without seeing one, the area is famous for its black bear population. At nearly every trailhead, there is some type of reminder on what to do if you see a bear. Over the years, advice has changed. For example, in the past, if a bear approached, people were taught to drop their bag and back away (we learned this from an old timer). That approach trained a lot of bears to approach people for their bags. Another example is that the shelters in the Smokies used to have fences guarding the entrance so that you could stay safe from them at night. Kind of like being the zoo exhibit. This also trained bears that people were good places to obtain food since people brought their packs into the shelters, ate in them, etc. Sherpa and his younger brother remember staying in one of those shelters back in 2004 and the wonderful safety they provided from the curious animals (excluding mice of course) making their nightly visits. Those fences have now all been removed and hikers are trained to not camp in a way that trains bears to associate people with food. These practices include hanging your food bag well away from your camp site. Never leaving food around camps. Unfortunately, careless hikers are killing bears by not following these simple practices. When a bear learns to associate people with food, it quickly loses its fear of man. We heard several stories of people who cooked their dinners only to have a bear walk right up. Who is going to argue with a bear? There was a hiker a couple weeks ago who was bit through his tent at night in the Smokies. The bear raided several other tents as well that night. The bear was put down as a result. We have no firsthand knowledge and hope it isn't true, but were told by fellow hikers that despite news reports to the contrary, the hiker was sleeping with food in his tent. 
 So what do you do if you see a bear? Make loud intimidating noises of course to scare it off! ""Bear!!! Go away!!!"". Beat your trekking poles furiously. Thrash them against nearby trees even! Sherpa tried these all to no avail. So instead he called his wife and had a nice long conversation (albeit not very private, being watched by bear and all) for over half an hour. She laughed at his yelling attempts. Apparently they weren't all that intimidating. He wasn't frightened, just frustrated that the bear was so comfortable around people. He prayed that bear would just walk away. Right when he prayed, the bear walked behind a tree. Approaching to see if the path was clear, bear was only a few more feet off the trail, still too close to pass. Rocks in hand, Sherpa waited, secretly hoping the story wouldn't end with a dead bear...
 Interestingly, God gave animals a wonderful gift after Noahs flood, called the fear of man. He placed it on them for their own protection. He gave mankind a much better gift, the right to eat those animals. The account is given in Genesis 9 if memory serves. Fear of man is very healthy for animals. The dodo bird lacked it for some reason and quickly went extinct when coming into contact with us. Apparently the bears this year are much more active than normal. The fall acorn crop wasn't great and the bears went to sleep hungry on average. Awaking from hibernation under weight and with no berries for another month, they are having to get very creative with food sources. A record number of thru hikers, a few of them careless, seem to be training some black bears to identify people with food. 
 As the standoff continued, a pair of northbound hikers approached walking a delicious dog snack on a leash. Sherpa warned them of the bear and they just laughed and shouted ""he won't hurt you"" as they walked up to bear to snap some pictures. Sherpa decided bear would be much more interested in the dog treat then a big stinky hiker so he passed as they stood there taking photos. The whole event cost precious time. With several miles to go, even walking full speed (about 3mph) was now going to put him back at the trailhead after dark. For some reason, this is the best (or worst depending on your situation) time to encounter wild life. Jogging where safe, making lots of noise, he prayed that he Lord would restore the fear of man on every bear in between him and the car. 10 minutes to nine, 20 minutes after the sun had set, 4 more bear sitings, several deer sitings, and a few intially terrifying chipmunk encounters later (hey they make a lot of noise when startled), he was back at the car. He won't forget his head lamp again...","Tennesse 91 at mile 447.3

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535710,"Today, we decided that while she is setting up the new campsite, he would do an extra long day to push them into Virginia! We are thrilled to make it into Virginia...even though we know that many hikers get the Virginia blues (it constitutes about 25% of the trail, and has a reputation for being a really long tree tunnel). Hopefully he can help push us through it fast since he isn't carrying his pack right now.
She dropped him off sort of late in the day, and set off to find the new campground. We are moving to Grindstone Campground. We knew that they had some non reservable sites that are walk up, and we're fortunate to find a spot to stay in through the busy holiday weekend! 
 The drive felt like it took forever, but she made it and they had space! We are so thankful that we were able to get a spot! God is so good! It is a beautiful campground that is a good proximaty to several of the trail crossings that Sherpa will be coming to over the next 100 miles. We might stay here several nights! The only downside is that neither of our phones get service here. There is however weak wifi at the front of the park, so we'll try to update if possible.
 After setting up camp, she went to Damascus to putz around a little bit. Damascus is a town in southwest Virginia that caters to outdoor enthusiasts. She poked her head in an outfitter and also stopped at a cute coffee shop for lunch where she plans to wait for him to finish his day! She worked out some potential mileage options for him over the next few days while there. She enjoyed the coffee shop! She also met a fellow Thru Hiker who was an incredibly friendly older gentleman named squarepeg. She hopes Sherpa runs into him on the trail! 
 Meanwhile, Sherpa, undeterred by the bear encounters of the previous day, pressed on. After about 30 minutes on the trail, a fellow northbound we approached him from behind to pass him. Since Sherpa isn't carrying a pack, and this hiker was, pride was hurt. Stepping aside, he asked the guy's name. ""Bullet"". Aptly named. Instead of being left in the dust, Sherpa kicked it up a step and walked the whole day with him. It was nice to have company other than squirrels for a change. Bullet was a college student from Virginia Tech who had been a cross country runner and decided to hike he whole trail during his summer break. Initially planning on doing it in 90 days, he realized his is on track to finish it under 80! He had already walked about 15 miles by the time they met and walked another 22! An engineering student and a licensed pilot, they had plenty of nerdy things to discuss during the day (after all, Sherpa is an aerospace engineer...).
 He strolled into town early in the evening exhausted as you can imagine after such a long trek. We headed back to the campground for some much deserved dinner! We went to sleep early because Sherpa was so tired! She was grateful that Sherpa approved of both the campground as well as the site she chose! We will enjoy this campground very much! An extra bonus is that the hosts are probably some of the sweetest people we've met!","Tennessee 91 at mile 447.3

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535713,"Today we got a late start and we dropped Sherpa off at the Cave Junction Station on the Virginia Creeper Trail north of Damascus. He will be walking southbound back to the city. We did this because we were unsure where the road crossing was and wanted to find it together. This will add 0.5 miles to his trek today to get to the AT. He doesn't mind the extra miles though because he's not carrying a heavy pack! We took a few photos before he went on his way. There aren't really any road acces points for his trek today so we'll just plan on meeting in Damascus early in the evening. 
 She decided to get a few things that she won't be able to find in Damascus, so she headed into Bristol. It was a much larger town than she imagined...they have nearly every store here. After getting a few grocery items and some plastic containers, she decided to find a Christian Book Store. Since we're slackpacking, we want a full size Bible. We don't want to just read the scripture in our phones. She found a store on google maps called Gospel Book Store and it was a short drive for her from the grocery store. She went in and was immediately greeted by Sue. Sue was so kind and helped her find the perfect Bible for the trip. She chatted with Sue for a while, she felt as though she could chat with her all day! Sue is an incredibly sweet woman of God and that short conversation with her was very encouraging! Upon hearing that we are newly weds, she gifted us a book for married couples. She also gave us a book for Sherpa to read as well as a few more resources! We are incredibly blessed by her! Thank you so much Sue! We are so thankful and we are enjoying the devotional book you gave us! Sue also invited us to church in Damascus at Damascus First Baptist Church. We will plan on going here on Sunday and we hope to see Sue and meet her family. 
 After all the errands, she headed back to Damascus to wait for Sherpa. He arrived right around 6 PM. He certainly would have been there sooner, except we misread the map at the creeper trailhead and he went the wrong way on the AT...poor guy added an extra mile or so to his short day. We had planned on a short day to allow a blister to heal...hopefully it will heal soon! 
 The hike itself was mostly uneventful. The most exotic creatures were a bald guy with a goatee died blue wearing a kilt and a copperhead snake. Not really sure which was scarier... There was also a couple of Indian hikers that seemed a little shaken up. Apparently they had seen a bear literally rolling down the mountain in front of them (think end over end). Further along the trail, Sherpa ran into a pair of ladies walking their (big) dogs. No leashes, they recounted how their dogs had just finished chasing a bear right where those guys had been... If the bears in these parts have lost their fear of man, they sure haven't lost their fear of big dogs.
 After Sherpa arrived we headed back to camp to have dinner and relax. Sherpa made a fire and we enjoyed fish cooked over the fire...thankfully Sherpa wasn't too tired to cook! On a side note, our campground has certainly filled up for the Memorial Day weekend! The family across from us has several teenagers. The noise of them playing volleyball together and catchphrase is a welcome sound to us. We plan on hiking Mt. Rogers tomorrow together. There is a spur trail off the AT that we will take.

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535721,"We are trying to hit the high point of every state we go through...Virginia's is Mt. Rogers. It is a short trek from the AT and it is close to our campground, so we would like to do it now if her ankle can tolerate it. This morning, we went to Grayson Highlands State Park to climb Mt. Rogers by way of the AT from Massie Gap. The plan was, if all goes well, Sherpa will continue to hike the AT for about 10 more miles after we're done with Mt. Rogers.
 We started our trek from Massie Gap, and we couldn't have been more pleased with the weather! It was a beautiful day with incredible views! After about a mile on the AT we encountered something she had been looking forward to...wild ponies! They are so pretty! There are signs everywhere that tell you not to feed or pet the ponies...however we went to take a photo near them and they come right up to you as if they're frequently fed by tourists. We really enjoyed all the cute ponies!
 We continued our trek and found a nice place with a beautiful view to take a lunch break! We enjoyed our lunch from one of the prettiest spots on the trail! Thank you to the kind gentleman who pointed the spot out to us!
 As we continued our way up to Mt. Rogers, there were more ponies! With this bunch, there was a foal! It was so cute! It stayed near it's momma, but we still got some good views of it! We didn't stop long for the second ponies since we'd already seen the first bunch! It didn't take us too long to get to the summit. Only about 3 hours for 4.5 miles with lunch and breaks to see the ponies. We think that we made good timing considering she has a sprained ankle that is still swollen. Thankfully, it didn't give her too much trouble. She had to take some to the rocky areas a little more slowly. She didn't really have pain until about 3.5 miles in. Not too bad all things considered.
 Now thankfully she had researched a bit about the Mt. Rogers summit prior to them going so she knew that there was no view and no real way to tell that you were at the top! We were told that the second rock pile with the medallion on it was the high point, so there we took our photo. She read a story of someone who got to the top and didn't realize it and looked around for a while before someone else told them they were at the top. We are thankful that we made it to the top and especially that her ankle held up for the hike! 
 We decided to change plans and just go back together as it was getting a little late and he would have finished after dark. This meant he would have to redo a 4 mile section of the trail, but he also wanted to make sure she got back safely since her ankle was hurting.

We know that it is not long compared to a lot of people, but we are enjoying celebrating every milestone...at least for the first year! They say hiking the trail is like getting 6 years of marriage in 6 months. If that's true, 3 is a big accomplishment! And since we were married on leap day, we will only get maybe 15 real anniversaries if we live into our nineteen... Our first priority today was to thank God that he brought us together and that we are enjoying the blessing of marriage that we've been given.
 We went to church at Damascus First Baptist Church where Sue and her family attend. The congregation was very welcoming and the pastor was spot on, clearly teaching verse by verse what the bible says. His family was in town and they sang a four part quartet to lead worship. It was really sweet. Definitely a church we would return to if in the area. They also support hikers, providing showers during the trail festival which required washing over 500 towels a day. Many people took hikers into their houses too during that time. Their next outreach- free oil changes for the community to help people get ready for summer driving season. Very healthy church that was helping out the community. 
 Following church we had lunch at an old mill that was right in front of a waterfall. Gorgeous. We poked around a few stores in Damascus and in the afternoon we rented bikes and took a shuttle up the mountain to the head of the Virginia creeper trail. We road a 17 mile section of the bike path that is mostly downhill through beautiful Appalatian mountains along a stream. There were about 20 different trestle bridges they crossed which were left over from an old railroad. So enjoyable. Lots of families were renting bikes and taking their children. If we have a family some day, this is a place we would definitely consider taking them. There are even cute stores and cafes all along the trail to visit. A must if you go to Damascus.

He did the first four miles in just over an hour (it took three on Saturday) and continued along at a good pace. The views were still great. He wore American flag shorts in honor of Memorial Day and got lots of compliments along the trail. The exciting part of the day was that we hit 500 miles today! How many people walk 500 miles in a year? Probably everyone with functioning legs, it turns out. Well, it turns out according to some random and probably poorly documented study that Google led us to, in American where we are from, the average person (assuming you aren't Amish and if you are shame on you for using the Internet) takes about 5200 steps per day. With a stride length somewhere between 2 and 3 feet, this means most of us are walking less than 3 miles a day, or less than a thousand miles a year. Think a thousand miles is a lot? Do your own googling, America is way behind the bar here compared with other countries. Most researches recommend at least 5 miles a day (hence 10000 steps). Also, you may not be anywhere near the average. Averages are tricky- all those healthy people in Colorado and California are making up for the slack of us Texans for example. Living in one of the ""fattest"" cities in America (measured by the ratio of restaurants to parks- with over 3000 restaurants in our metropolitan area, we can eat out every day at different restaurant for about 10 years!!!), the average may be lower regionally and will definitely be influenced by demographics such as your age and occupation. And it's not entirely our fault. Our society is setup with dispersed infrastructure catering to automobile transportation almost exclusively in all but the most urban areas. This doesn't really lend itself to walking to work and the grocery store for most people for example. But if we could, we would have cleaner air, more time to enjoy each other, and better health. What is one to do? Conventional wisdom says go get a fit bit and get your steps in. But that may not be the right answer. Sitting all day and then getting lots of steps at once probably isn't equivalent to being somewhat active all day. Plus, you still have to spend all the time driving from one place to the next. If you then try to get steps in at the end of the day, you'll have even less time to spend with loved ones. And that is what you call a tangent...
 Back to the hike, he saw a baby pony laying on the ground. He was a bit alarmed and verified it was breathing. He later learned that it is normal for them to lay down in that fashion. Meanwhile, she went back to Damascus for another coffee and sand which. She picked up a few luxury items as well such as a lantern for our sprawling camp. He finished in decent time as it was mostly downhill (he started near the high point) and they met up as planned despite having poor cell phone signals throughout the day. 
 unfortunately, his blister was growing rather than shrinking. We decided to try to exchange his shoes. We bought them together at Cabelas a couple of weeks earlier in an attempt to give him a trail runner option. However, with all the long days, his feet had swelled and no longer fit I them well. They say you need to buy a size larger than normal. He proved this to be true. Thank you Cabelas for your awesome return policy. While heading there they saw a moose! Not on the trail, but under an overpass holding a sign saying at thru hiker needs ride to Nasheville. Whoa! We ""banged a u.e."" (Made a u-turn) and picked him up. Apparently he had some business to take care of. Ironically, he is the one who once told us that 'you'll never know if someone quits the trail, you just won't see them anymore and the trail will feel less crowded.' We caught up on lots of trail gossip (one guy we knew stole a car and ended up in jail, another quit, giggles is not far, etc.), fed him a ""healthy"" serving of key lime pie, and said our farewells. We hope he gets back on the trail but wish him the best either way.","Massie Gap

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536192,"Today we set out to hike northbound from Grayson highlands state park. This was going to be another mostly downhill day for Sherpa, and goodbye ponies for Porter. When she climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in 2010, there were lots of people called ""Porters"" that helped with everything from making sure the climbers were well fed, to guiding them, to getting them to places of rest, etc. eerily similar to what she is doing for Sherpa while her ankle heals. He decided to start calling her Porter in honor of that memory and all of her help.
 Porter really enjoyed the ponies today...even if it was raining. She had them all to herself! She sat on a bench and simply enjoyed watching them. She followed a small side trail and found a mare and her yearling. They were a little more skiddish than the rest of the bunch but Porter still enjoyed them. As soon as Porter was back on the AT, it began to rain. She put on her rain jacket and decided to head to the car. It started pouring rain. There was a steady flow of water pouring down the trail. By the time she made it to the car, she was soaked through all her clothes and her boots were full of water. She was praying that Sherpa wasn't in the rain storm as well. She warmed up in the car, went and got dry clothes on and then headed to meet Sherpa for lunch. She was happy to see that he was dry! 
 After lunch, we decided to take Sherpa to Dickey's Gap and drop him off to hike back to the area of the campground. She left him and went to town to get some internet and find our next campground. Thankfully she discovered that there is another USFS campground that will meet our needs for several days, Stony Fork Campground near Bland, VA. Meanwhile, Sherpa, now walking southbound, crossed paths with healer and his girlfriend who he had also passed going northbound in the morning. They were throuroughly confused. It was a fairly uneventful day. There was a pretty waterfall in the afternoon.
 Nothing really funny happened today, but we forgot to mention something we found amusing yesterday. Sherpa came across a guy who walked past him and said, ""I just played for the cows, and they came and listened."" Sherpa asked, ""played what?"" He replied, ""my melodica"". The guy was carrying around a keyboard that was mouth activated and playing for cows in a field. The only regret is not getting to the field in time to see this take place. He explained, ""I've heard that strong quartets play for cows sometimes so I tried it. They came and listened!"" He then excused himself. When Sheepa approached the cow field, the thought briefly crossed his mind to serenade the cows. Right before he belted out a rendition of ""the hills are alive with the sound of music,"". He notices several other hikers in the area and instead made small talk.","Massie Gap

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536193,"Today, we started back at Dickey's gap and headed northbound. When she dropped him off, there was a guy at the trailhead that didn't seem to have all of his marbles, so we waited until he left before saying our goodbyes. Healer and his girlfriend walked up before Sherpa headed off and Porter got a chance to catch up with them. After 14 miles, Sherpa came to partnership shelter. This shelter has a hot shower! Needless to say, that has attracted a lot of hikers. We know from
moose that some have been camped here for over a week consuming large quantities of alcohol. Porter had walked up the trail a ways to meet Sherpa and we passed by the shelter together, recognizing a few faces from the pot smoking bubble of hikers they had been trapped in around hot springs.
. We enjoyed a nice late lunch together (it was around 4pm) and then Sherpa continued North for 4 more miles to finish the day. When he got there, Porter was not to be seen. It was obvious that the road was impassible so he continued on another 3 miles to the next crossing. This was not even a road, witch meant he had to go another 1.5 miles. Finally, we were reunited and got a few extra miles in. We try to scout out most crossings together which results in walking southbound much of the time. This is an example of what can happen. We were prepared for this and had discussed going ahead if not there by a certain time, etc. The mountain roads are usually pretty good, but usfs roads are reliably unreliable in this part of the country at least. We knew we would eventually get to a good road.","Dickey Gap

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536772,"Yesterday while heading to the new campground, she saw a little store with s restaurant called ""Dutch Pantry"". It sounded like somewhere nice to stop and eat so we decided to head there in the morning to have breakfast there. It turns out, they only serve lunch. We bought some delicious homemade apple bread to tide us over with the intention of coming back for lunch. This however will cause us to change Sherpa's route for the day. She dropped him off at I-81 and will pick him up at the settlers museum in an hour. At I-81, the trail passes through an Excon station. He posed for a photo with the Tiger.
 After an uneventful 2.8 miles, she picked him up and they headed to the Dutch Pantry for the second time today. We ordered two sandwiches and split them. We also bought a bottle of Birch Beer to share since she had never tried it before. She enjoyed it. The sandwiches were very good, and we even bought a loaf of sourdough bread from the bakery as it was so tasty! We also found some other treats that you would find at an Amish-style country store. It was run by Mennonite women who were all very helpful and kind.
 After lunch, we decided to find VA 625/USFS 222 and drop Sherpa off there so as to make sure it was accessible by car. This would have been the end of his day if he had instead continued to walk north after lunch. Instead, he walked south from here back towards where she had picked him up earlier. It turned out it was more than an hour drive and 7.9 miles was on a narrow gravel road that was on a mountainside. Thankfully we only ran into one car on the way down. At the trailhead, there were lots of pretty butterflies! One even crawled onto Porters hand, but flew away before Sherpa could snap a photo. She was a little nervous to drive out alone, but prayed the entire way up. She didn't encounter any other vehicles and made it out safely!
 While on the trail, Sherpa ran into Burly. We hadn't seen him since the day we climbed out of the Nantihala River gap back in North Carolina. He is the guy who commented, ""I think I found my waist..."" Turns out he has lost over 45 pounds and his doctor has slowly been reducing a number of prescriptions he is on. He is looking forward to some Doctor visits in a month to confirm his improved health. He mentioned how he had a lot of fun at trail days for about three days partying really hard and then spent a day volunteering with one way missions because they were so helpful to all the hikers. He was put to work in a local thrift store. There are so many missions that help hikers, be encouraged, the bible says the fields are white with a harvest and this is just one example of someone who was touched.
 Her next stop was to give Sherpa a snack and water break at VA 42, a 6.9 mile walk for Sherpa. She took some time to enjoy her book while waiting for Sherpa. Our original mileage plan included Sherpa walking from VA 625 back to I 81, however due to our unplanned lunch break in addition to the breakfast and the long drive to VA 625, we decided to shorten Sherpa's mileage as we knew he would have to walk in the dark otherwise. So, we decided to drop him off at Old Rich Valley road so he could walk back to VA 42 again. When he started to hike he realized he didn't have his trekking poles...uh oh. Thankfully it was a short hike...she went back to VA 42 to find the poles and wait for him. When she got there, there was a man stopped there. He found Sherpa's trekking poles and had propped them up on a tree for us! We are so thankful they weren't lost forever! The man's name was Lumbermack. He was a thru hiker in 2006. He now operates a hostel in Ceres, VA. He runs his hostel with Christian Values. He just opened 5 weeks ago and we hope his business does well! If we weren't camping or slackpacking we would have loved to stay at his hostel. He has chickens, donkeys, and goats at his hostel! How fun!

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536781,"We started by doing the section from Garden Mountain down to Va 625. It was a long drive through Burkes Garden, but it was a beautiful area and a cute country town. The town had a general store which is operated by an Amish woman. She will stop at the store on the way out for sure! She was relieved today that the gravel road wasn't too bad up to Garden Mountain...and it was less than 2 miles of gravel. It had a very nice parking area and we sat for a few minutes before Sherpa went on his way!  He crossed paths with Burly again and chatted for a minute. He also met a guy named gasket. We are sure glad he asked how gasket got his name... Apparently one night he grabbed a bottle to pee into instead of getting out of his tent. Turns out a part of his water filter called the gasket was in the bottle. Oops! 
After Sherpa was well on his way, she headed down the Mountain. She stopped in and the Burkes Garden general store. There was a mish mash of Amish goods, including cook books, hats, jams, maple syrup and many other tasty treats. She ordered a sandwich from Ms. Mattie who runs the store. The sandwich was very tasty as well...really tasty homemade sourdough bread. She enjoyed her sandwich on the porch and visited with some of the locals of Burkes Garden. They were all very friendly to her. After lunch she went in and purchased another load of fresh sour dough bread...she knows Sherpa will enjoy this at his lunch break today! She also bought a bottle of Birch Beer and a bottle of Saspirilla. We will split these later most likely.  After lunch she braved the road down to VA 625. She was nervous to drive the road after the rains from last night. Thankfully the road was fine except for one spot that she was too nervous to take the car through. She pulled the car over and walked the 1/2 mile to the trail head to get Sherpa. He wasn't quite there yet, so she hiked up the trial in her crocs in the mud like any wife would who was excited to pick her husband up and have him drive up the treacherous gravel road! She was relieved to see him...he lent her his trekking poles for the hike down to the gravel road. We returned to the car just in time. A logging truck was waiting to pass and couldn't get by her car. Sherpa decided to go through the mud that she was nervous about. The car made it just fine. We decided to turn around and wait...Sherpa got impatient and decided to just head out...the only problem was the log truck was still there waiting to go through the mud. There was no where that the log truck could go beside us, so Sherpa had to drive about 1/3 mile in reverse. Thankfully the log truck driver was very patient with us. After they passed we were able to get out easily! Thank you to Sherpa for driving us out!  The next leg for today is finishing up the miles from yesterday from Old Rich Valley Road to I-81. While heading there, he ate most of that loaf of sourdough single handedly. She convinced him to save a little for dinner which resulted in the best BLT's imaginable. Sherpa hiked this southbound as well due to location of the end of the first segment. While she waited for Sherpa, she went to Rural Retreat to take care of laundry...a much needed task at this time. Sherpa really needs some clean hiking clothes! He arrived at I-81 right on time and we headed home...to the campground that is. The exciting thing that happened today is that we hit the quarter way point on the trail! We feel pretty good about our progress considering the days we had to take off.","VA 625/USFS 222

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536794,"After she talked about yesterday's lunch at the general store, they knew they would stop there for lunch today. First we split a lemon turnover, and fresh homemade strawberry ice cream topped with fresh strawberry topping. It was so tasty! The. We decided to split a sandwich, chips, and a birch beer for lunch. It was so yummy. We also bought another loaf of fresh sourdough bread. The lady was a little surprised the two of us finished a whole loaf in one day. We also bought a bottle of local maple syrup made in Burkes Garden. We can't wait to taste it! Yummy! 
 After lunch we headed up to Garden Mountain again where Sherpa was starting from today. Today's hike was northbound, which meant he wouldn't meet as many hikers. He saw a few deer along the way, but mostly had an uneventful morning. After he left, she decided to head out and see if she had time for a grocery stop... thankfully she had enough time to make the 20 minute drive before meeting him for a snack break. She ended up in West Virginia! Crazy...but it was only a 20 minute drive from where she was on I-77.
 She met up with him at around 4 pm at Suiter Road which was 8.9 miles into his hike. He had been chatting with a biker at the trailhead while waiting for her to come. He guy was actually a pastor of a church we had past the previous day. He seemed really down to earth, we plan to visit his church in the morning. Sherpa enjoyed some of the fresh sourdough! It is so yummy when it's fresh baked! He walked the first 4.5 miles with a hiker named ""momma duck."" The guy was an extreme Boy Scout and knew everything about backpacking. He had an eagerness to teach others which led to his name. Not surprisingly, he was ridiculously smart (a theoretical math major) which led to interesting conversations with Sherpa, a fellow nerd. The second half of the hike was uneventful except for a rain shower that rolled in towards the end. He took a picture and joked that it was a fantastic view for a bathroom...
 After their break, she went to wait for Sherpa at the I-77 overpass. When it was about 30 minutes prior to his projected arrival time it began to rain heavily. She made the executive decision to come 0.4 miles closer to save him from some of the rain. It turns out to have been a good choice. After he came up, another hiker showed up who looked miserable and wet. He needed a ride. We were able to drop him off at a hotel where he was hoping to dry out his boots. His name was tortoise and he was very nice. We were happy to be able to help him out!  We went back to camp to make BLTs for dinner. As soon as we started cooking it started to rain.

We went to both Sunday school and the regular service. We were incredibly blessed by this church service. After church we headed to Wyethville to grab some lunch...because it's the nearest large town. We found a Chinese restaurant and decided to give it a try.

This is where she rescued him from the rain on Saturday. He crossed paths with a very special hiker named ""special k"". ""Special k"" is a 14 year old girl who is hiking the trail unsupported, with the goal of being the youngest to ever complete the trail by herself. After a quick hello, he pressed on. Meanwhile, she got the car vacuumed out- it had gotten very dirty over the last few weeks!!! She also got up to Bog Walker Gap, a store with a nice view.
 We were able to coordinate our day so that we could meet up after about 8 miles to walk together to the 600 mile mark on the trail. It was really nice to hike together, even if it was only a short distance. When we found the marking on a tree, she turned back to the car and he plowed ahead toward a location several miles further for lunch. She got to meet ""Special k"" on her return hike to the car too. Lunch involved peanut butter, jelly, bread, and snacks. We knew this was a shorter day and kept lunch small to save room for a big dinner. Pushing ahead, he noticed that this section of trail has lots of caterpillars eating everything. It was almost annoying to walk because the caterpillars hang from trees and you constantly walk into them and then have to wipe hem off your clothes.
 While finishing the last few miles, he crossed paths with a pair of hikers that we hadn't seen since our first week on the trail. They had offered us peanut m&ms while we camped near a shelter and we never forgot it. Always good to run into people you haven't seen in 500 miles, like running into an old friend!
 With the northbound hike finished for the day, we headed back to camp. It was our last night at the Stoney form campground and we had amassed quite a horde of firewood left behind by other campers. You aren't supposed to move firewood from one place to the next because you can spread pests and diseases to other forests. Most people seem to be obeying this rule, which has worked out for us because we hardly ever have to buy firewood. Due to all the rain of the last few days, this was going to be our last chance to have a good fire before packing up. After a little effort given the wet wood, he got it lit good.

For those of you who have been to Greece, this is the distance from the city of Athens to the city of - you guessed it - the city of Marathon, about 26.2 miles. Some ancient runner made the trek and now people everywhere are doing it as the ultimate long distance running event. Sherpa walked it. Took a long time. Not a lot more to say about that. Kudos to people who can do it in 4 hours. 
 Early in the day, Sherpa crossed paths with our old Peanut m&m dealing friends. Their names are squish (because he yelled squish to let other hikers know the trail was muddy) and yogi (because she growled like a bear and had a bear sweatshirt early on). After catching up, we said see ya later again. A short way down the path, he saw a cub running down the trail. No mamma bear anywhere to be seen though. Cautiously, he continued his trek. He passed the infamous Wapiti shelter, unaware of its dark history (hikers were murdered there years ago). 
 Thankfully, we were able to meet for a nice lunch at Sugar run gap. Afterwards, we hiked together to a nearby scenic overlook. Always nice to spend a mile together on the trail. We parted ways, and as it got later in the evening, he passed ""prov"", a hiker girl from Chicago who had lots of running advice. Saw another bear, this one a little bigger than a cub but not huge. She met him after he crossed a road and they walked together the last .4 miles into the outskirts of Pearisburg. 
 The highlight of our day though, by far, was running into Sandals and snail while at dinner. They are another married couple with similar values to us who are in our age range. We met them early on but were going way faster than them because snail had shin splints. After taking a few weeks off, we assumed they were ahead of us and had been hoping to catch up to them.

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538014,"Today, Sherpa hiked southbound the entire day. In the morning, Porter dropped him off 4 miles north of town and he walked back to the place he had finished yesterday. The morning hike was smelly. We later found out that it was beside dump. At least there were signs warning not to use the water. The highlight was a graveyard with a revolutionary war veteran buried there. He saw several hikers, including ""Prov"" and ""the hostel hores (that is how they spell it)"". We came back to our hotel and made lunch. We are staying at the MacArthur Inn. The owner's name is Allen Neely. We really like him. After lunch, he told us that he would take care of our dishes which was really nice of him, so we left them in his kitchen.
 After lunch, she drove further North so he could continue to walk southbound back to the spot she had started him at this morning. This was going to be a harder hike then it would have been to just walk Northbound because there was a large elevation gain. He chose to walk that direction to see the friends they had run into at dinner. 
 The highlight of the afternoon hike was a doe with her fawn that were sitting on the trail. When Sherpa approached them, rather than running into the woods, the pair just walked along the trail about 5 yards ahead of him. They did that for several minutes. Eventually, he got to a switchback and climbed up to the next section of trail to get around them without disturbing them anymore. 
The trail followed the West Virginia border briefly in this section before turning more East. The saddest part of the hike was that the caribeener securing the Deuce of Spades poop shovel fell off of his super awesome fanny pack. He found it on the trail, he lost it on the trail. He also lost the remote for the camera yesterday off a caribeener. Perhaps the moral of the story is that he needs better caribeeners? He saw ""the hostel hores"" and Prov again in the afternoon which of course confused them. Prov suggested a different running shoe, called the La Sportiva wildcat. We will keep an eye out for a pair. 
 While Sherpa was hiking in the afternoon, Porter went back to the MacArthur inn and got some good stories out of Allen. Her favorite was his account of an attempt to get home from a busy downtown after taking home first place in a mustache competition. He told her that it was late at night, there were a lot of one way streets, some of which he went the wrong direction on. After at least 30 minutes of this aimless wandering, he was pulled over by a police officer. After getting his information, she said to him, ""Mr Neely, what on earth do you think you are doing?!"" Apparently, she had been following him for some time. He explained that he was just trying to get home from a mustache competition that he had won. She let him off with a warning, but required him to sign it, ""First Place."" He then followed her out of the city. 
 Porter also chatted with two hikers named Derby and Kryptonite who were taking a zero. Derby had gotten sick (possibly Noro Virus or Giardia). Porter shared her theory on diseases spreading by the sharing of pipes used for drugs on the trail with them. She also learned from Kryptonite that the hiker who was bitten by a bear through his tent back in the smoky mountains a few weeks ago may have been wearing some type of lotion on his legs that had a coconut scent. This does not bode well for Sherpa, since he is always storing food in his mustache and beard! 
 Last night, we stayed at the MacArthur Inn in Narrows Virginia. It was such a highlight that we decided to stay again tonight. Porter had checked in before picking up Sherpa, and when we returned, the owner asked if he could upgrade us to a room that did not have a shared bathroom. We gladly accepted, but informed him that we needed to pick up our bags from the closet of the other room. Apparently, when the Delaware rowing team showed up, someone working the desk had given our room to them. We didn't mind and enjoyed chatting with them. They are biking across the country to stay in shape during the summer.

Today, We split the hike up. The first section was a couple downhill miles bak to the Cherokee Flats picnic area where we had left off yesterday. The second section continued from the starting point (a USFS road) and headed Northbound about 9 miles. 
 In the morning, Sherpa ran into ""Waist Management"", a hiker in his 70's that slackpacked himself with a van and a motorcycle. He would park his van at a trailhead, get his motorcycle off a trailer and drive it to another trailhead, walk back to his van, drive back to his motorcycle, sleep in his van, and then repeat the process. What a lot of driving. He was averaging 8-10 miles of walking a day. He told Sherpa that a bear had visited him the night before and to check out his van, which was parked up at the start of Sherpa's afternoon hike. Sure enough, there were paw prints all over. Not the kind of guests you want to visit you in the night! We started the afternoon hike together for the first mile to get to a scenic overlook. Porter drove around to a midway point where she met Sherpa later in the day. The road was treacherous (potholes, very steep) and Sherpa decided that he did not want Porter to drive it back by herself so he drove the car down the road, ending their hiking for the day. 
 We were alright with it because it allowed us to get back to the MAcArthur Inn for a third night! Mr Neely had convinced us to stay one more night to attend a folk music jam session that he hosts at his hotel. The Curator for folk music recording for the national archives in Washington DC was in attendance recording the music. They played old folk songs like ""the war of 1812"", ""I'll fly away"", ""redwing"", ""Kingdom Coming"" and many others we didn't recognize. We really enjoyed listening. 
 We also met all kinds of interesting people. For example, we met a guy who told us how his grandma used to can opossum. He said, ""If grandma went to the trouble of canning it, you ate it!"". It reminded us of a few days ago when we saw someone carrying a squirming opossum by the tail in one hand with a shiny piston in the other. Dinner! There was another guy who kept walking up to Sherpa and telling him Bill Clinton jokes.
 The dinner was pretty good. Sherpa ordered a second one. The portions were pretty large. Mr Neely came to the rescue and explained to the cook that thruhikers can eat! The waitress had meth mouth. We knew that drugs were bad for you, and were sad to someone with this condition, especially young and pregnant.

 There are several terms that thru-hikers use to describe taking shortcuts on the trail. Following white blazes means you are following the trail. Following any other colored blaze would mean you were not on the trail. Blue blazes sometimes indicate side trails. Aqua blazing refers to people who take canoes thru Shenandoah valley instead of hiking the mountains. Yellow blazing refers to taking a car and skipping a section. That is exactly what we had to do today. We drove past the place where we stopped yesterday and picked up the hike 5.4 miles down the trail. We did this for safety reasons. Rocky Gap Road was a very steep, narrow, windy, potholed, treacherous road and we had no interest in risking it in our Toyota Corolla. For those of you worried that we won't hit all 2178+/- miles, rest assured we have banked over 5 extra miles in sections of the trail that we have hiked twice this year, such as the Grayson Highlands section and portions of the Virginia Creeper trail. In fact, we even hiked an extra 15 mile section that was closed due to a fire and then reopened later but the conservancy advised hikers to skip. So today we cashed in some of those miles we had banked and used them to avoid a safety hazard. 
 On the way to the trail, we saw a really cool historic covered bridge. One of the advantages of slackpacking is that you see so much of small town America driving to the trailheads. Porter picked up a delicious cantaloupe from a nearby farmers stand, which we gladly shared with hungry hikers at Miller Cove Road.
 On the trail, Sherpa ran into lots of hikers we know. The first was Derby. He was looking better after the bout of sickness. He shared that several others hikers all got sick the same time as him and they all shared a pipe. He was now convinced that the drug use got him sick and was not going to share anymore. Sherpa also saw another girl who was sick. The guy with her was carrying her pack in addition to his own. Sweet memories of the time Sherpa carried Porter's pack. Sherpa offered to carry the extra pack seeing as he had none but the guy declined, too macho to accept assistance. Then he saw Giggles again! Giggles is the fastest hiker that makes little progress that we know. We couldn't hope to keep up with him with packs on, but somehow he is always behind us. Thankfully, when we met for lunch, Giggles walked by and got to catch up with Porter as well. We even saw spaceman toady. Last time we saw him was in Smokies. 
 We also met a new hiker named ""Kernel"", a retired military Colonel whose sister misspelled his rank one too many times. He never backpacked before hiking the AT! He decided to hike it 2 weeks before he started. Needless to say, he was every outfitters dream come true. He walked into REI and bought the store! 
 Tonight we car camped near the trail in Miller Cove. We setup our backpacking tent with an air mattress inside. It felt like cheating! It sounded like a good idea but the air mattress partially deflated during the night.","Sinking Creek Valley

 This morning we woke up in our ""tarptent"" on the side of the trail, walked to our car, got out our Coleman campstove with a built in griddle, and began grilling pancakes. Wow! What a way to start the day. It wasn't long before a group of hungry thruhikers had plopped down nearby and benefited from Porter's culinary skills. Giggles was the first to venture over, followed by Jackie Love, firefly and eventually Kernel. As we were leaving, the group all bathed in a nearby stream. We later learned that most of them ended up staying at a nearby cabin that the owner offered them in exchange for some yard work. What a deal!
 Not that we can complain, tonight we are staying with some friends that we met at Grindstone campground a couple weeks ago. As Sherpa was tearing down camp, Porter struck up a conversation with a couple who were walking their dog. After a few minutes, they exchanged contact info and invited us to stay when we reached the McAfee Knob area. We are excited because we will get to go to church with them in the morning. They took us to dinner tonight at a local Seafood restaurant. What a kind couple!
 The hike today, while not super long, was spectacular. Sherpa hiked northbound, while Porter drove the car to a lunch spot and then walked Southbound on the trail back towards Sherpa. We wanted to hike past the 700 mile mark together. We met at the Dragon's Tooth. It turns out that the most difficult section of the trail yet occurred around that mile mark. This was put down the trekking poles, scramble on all fours kind of climbing. We enjoyed it thoroughly. We hiked back to the car for lunch, which presented a dilemma. We had 4 hot dog buns, but only 2 hot dogs. Why don't they putthe same number of buns in the packages as they do hot dogs! This is undoubtable one of the biggest first world problems. Maybe Hillary or Donald can help! We solved the problem by splitting the hot dogs in half lengthwise and eating half a hot dog on each bun. Then Sherpa gulped down some wonderful Chocolate milk and the hike continued! 
 The second section of the hike was fairly uneventful. Sherpa ran into a group of weekend warriors who had parked next to us where we camped in the morning. They had left their window down. We assumed this was not intentional and rolled it up for them. They were appreciative when we let them know what we did.","Miller Cove Road

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538020,"This morning we went to church with our new friends. They are Gideons, which as best as we can tell, means that they work with churches to secure support and distribute bibles. They had lots of bibles in their house. They also had lots of guns. The husband had showed Sherpa his collection the night before. Even the handgun they kept in their kitchen. We wonder if they show all of the strangers that stay in their house where they keep their loaded guns? They were armed to the teeth and would fit in nicely in Texas. They also had more wall mounts of deer than the average native Texan, which is quite impressive.
 After church, they took us four wheeling on some land they owned in the country. They had a travel trailer on the property and another one for hunting back in the woods. Along with the two travel trailers in their driveway at their house and an RV van, they had 5 homes away from home! They also had one truck, one jeep, 2 cars, and an SUV. Everything was well maintained and very neat. The only thing they just had one of was Gussy, their German shepherd and travel buddy. 
 In the evening, we grilled out in their back yard. Sherpa was set over the cooking as Porter had bragged on his culinary skills. You buy it, we cook it! We really are grateful for all that you guys did for us! We were treated like family. We hope they come visit us some day in Texas.","Off Trail

Today we hiked up McAfee's Knob. This is reputed by some to be the most beautiful spot in Virginia. The view was truly spectacular. There is a large overhanging rock that many people take precarious pictures on to scare family members who have acrophobia (the fear of heights). We spared all of you by taking pictures safely away from the edge. Thanks ""worst case Ontario"" for snapping the picture for us. You almost convinced Sherpa to switch to a hiking kilt... Almost... They reputedly can save the world from its chafing problems... First world issues... It was nice as always to start the hike together. 
 He continued to hike North from the knob, while she headed back to our car. On her way, she crossed paths with giggles, firefly, and Jackie love again. Apparently giggles was behind because he started a fire and forgot to put it out. He did the right thing though and went back. As Sherpa pushed on, he met Keith higgenbaum(real name) aka huckleberry. Keith is doing a documentary and we included his real name in case he becomes famous someday.
 Unfortunatley, there were no road crossings to meet for lunch. We had dinner at a bbq restaurant near the trail. We saw lots of hikers we knew at the restaurant such as 3 navy guys we had first met back at the Fontana dam and then seen off and on throughout the Smokies. We also saw Purple rain and the guy she hikes with and Kryptonite.
 We are staying one last night with our friends from the campground. While sharing stories tonight, the husband mentioned to us that he finally located his lost glock. He had it under the mattress of the first bed! You never know when your guests might need a semi-automatic weapon! He also shared a story with us about a country church that had a division because they hosted a revival and invited a guest speaker against the senior pastors wish. The pastor resigned and was quickly hired by another nearby congregation. Unfortunately, the church he left quickly fell apart. They begged him to come back after a few months, but he declined. There were only a few members left, and they were meeting in the churches kitchen to keep warm while saving money because they couldn't afford to heat the sanctuary. They said to him, frustrated, what do you want us to do with the church? The pastor told them, ""put hay in it, it's not a church."" A few years later, the building which had been a country church, was being used to store hay. Wow! There are a lot of buildings in America that probably could be used for that same purpose. God is not a respecter of buildings, otherwise the tabernacle would never have been destroyed by Philistines, the first temple by Babalonians, the second temple by Romans, and other religious buildings used as places of worship throughout history. God desires his people to worship him!","311 Catawba balley drive

Today we said goodbye to our campground friends. The bible says that as Christians, we are to show hospitlity to strangers. Hebrews 13:2 tells us that some people, unaware of it, have entertained Angels by doing so. If you guys are reading this, we just want you to know that we are not Angels! Keep up the entertaining though, maybe next time. The bible also tells us in Matthew 10:42 that there is a reward for those who give even a cup of cold water to Disciples of Jesus Surely you guys have us more than just a cup of cold water. They sent us off with homemade jellies made with wild picked blackberries and rhubarb grown in their garden. Yum!
 After hiking a short distance, we ran an errand in nearby Daleville. We picked up a pair of new hiking shoes from the daleville outfitter. Maybe these will hold the secret to no blisters? Time will tell. She got a new purse (Kavu) that has climbing by ropes for a strap. After two months without a purse, it was time for a lifestyle upgrade. Continuing, the hike took us into the blue ridge parkway for the first time. And did it ever. We crossed it 6 times in one day. This was so fun because we got to see each other every 45 minutes. The Blue Ridge Parkway is a very scenic stretch of road that follows the Ridgeline of the Appalachian Mountains. The trail used to be located along the path of much of the current road, until the road was built and much of the trail got relocated.
 One other thing we bought at the store was a powder that claimed to eliminate chafing. So this conversation happened today: ""Sherpa, pull your pants up, there's a car coming!"" Dont worry, nobody saw him attempt to apply his anti chafing powder... He asked, ""Porter, can you keep my ""anti monkey butt anti friction powder"" in your purse?"" She helped him finish applying it but refused to store it...
Since we have been slackpacking for a month now (hiking from road crossing to road crossing supported by a car), we thought it would be interesting to share our thoughts. One of the really nice things is that it gives you the option to always walk downhill. Every town on the trail seems to be located in a gap in the mountains. The best practice is to always walk into town, whether going North or South. In addition, when you hike southbound, you get to meet all of the northbound hikers, which makes for an interesting hike. In fact, you become very recognizable. Someone said ""hi Sherpa!"" on the trail today that he didn't know. Note: you should always take note of the most recent water or campsite if you are hiking southbound, because chances are, someone will ask you about the next one regularly. Another big advantage of slackpacking is that you don't smell like a thru hiker because laundry is an option and clean clothes are plentiful. Onther nice advantage is that dayhikers, tourists, etc do not know that you are a thruhiker unless you mention it. Sometimes, it is fun to mingle and chat. Other times, you just want to get miles uninterrupted. But the best thing about hiking without a pack (besides of course not having to carry a pack), is that you can drink as much chocolate milk as you want!!!","US 220

Today's hike only had one crossing two miles in where we could meet. He opted to hike in his new shoes the whole day to try them out. No blisters so far. The trail climbed over ""Apple Orchard Mountain"", the last 4200 foot mountain until New Hampshire! The trail really flattens out over the next several states. Sherpa spent the majority of his hiking thinking about John the Baptist, the last and greatest of the Old Testament prophets according to Jesus. At a shelter, he saw several hikers chatting and stopped for a break. One hiker recounted the tale of how he had been craving corn dog that morning, and was able to catch a ride to a nearby grill and buy a corns of! Someone shouted ""your like nostridamus."" Why the world is fascinated by false prophets when there are vreal ones like John the Baptist whose words came to pass is hard to understand. There is so much deception in the world today. They got out some drugs, promting Sherpa to head on his way. 
 Speaking of John the Baptist, so we discovered a new protein source on the trail. Bugs! John the Baptist liked his with honey... Seriously though, Sherpa eats a few a day inadvertently when they just fly into his mouth. Also along the trail, deer have become so plentiful they aren't worth writing about. Saw another bear today as well.
 While Sherpa was thinking about John the Baptist, Porter was finishing a book called the Hising Place about Corrie Ten Boom, a Dutch woman who hid Jews in her house during WWII. When you pause and think about how no one wanted those people and they were being slaughtered, it makes you sad. Surely that will never happen again. For example, look how everyone is helping the Syrians who are being slaughtered today as a result of the conflict with ISIS. The world is welcoming them with open arms. Oh wait, no they aren't! People are behaving the same today towards the Syrian refugees as they did to the Jews less than 100 years ago. It's just easy to hate the Nazis, never mind that our American bombers intentionally did not target the railroads that were bring Jews into the concentration camps. Hopefully there is a godly remnant today like Corrie ten Boom of the past century, who are willing to love people and save lives despite cultural and religious differences. Jesus said (Matthew 5:43-48) we are no better than tax collectors and Gentiles if we just love the ones that are easy for us to love. We are commanded to love those that we perceive to be our enemies too. To illustrate this point, Jesus then tells how God sends rain on both the just and the unjust. To an agricultural society, rain was everything. God showed he same love to those who hated him by providing for them the rain necessary to live. Does our response to the Syrian refugee crisis situation reflect Gods love?","Bearwallow Gap - VA 43

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538415,"Today we skipped a small 5 mile section that we plan to hike tomorrow. We did this so that we could have good pick up and dropoff locations with reasonable mileage to hike. For the first half of the hike, Porter dropped Sherpa off at the Punchbowl Mountain overlook on the blue ridge parkway around noon. He walked southbound about 11 miles to the James River Foot Bridge, arriving around 3:45PM. Sherpa focused on memorizing part of Johns gospel, which really made time pass quickly. He carried his super awesome fanny pack with several bottles of water and some delicious snacks. Meanwhile, Porter went to a visitor center along the blue ridge parkway. A helpful park ranger pointed to a map of the parkway on the wall and said, you can have one if you want. She thanked him and told him that she already had one. Meanwhile, a developmentally challenged individual proceeded to try to peel the map off the wall. He said, ""you said we could have this, but it won't come off."" The park ranger was quick to give him one as well...
For the second section of the hike, they drove back to Petites Gap on the blue ridge parkway where she dropped him off at 5pm. He walked northbound about 10 miles back to the same foot bridge he had finished at earlier, arriving around 7:45pm. The weather forecast called for rain beginning at 7pm. Typically a 10 mile hike would have taken him until 8:20pm to complete going about three miles an hour. He donned his running shoes and they both prayed that the rain would hold off until he was safely in the car. His super awesome new running shoes allowed him to make really good time and thankfully the rain held off long enough for him to finish the hike. Thank you God. ""Many men will drink the rain, then turn and thank the clouds"" (sad but true lyrics from an old song). We are so grateful that God is in control of everything, including the rain. 
While Sherpa was making his way North in the afternoon, ""Paul Bunion"" lost his glasses. Bunion ran into some southbound hikers, and asked them to keep an eye out (pun intended). Apparently, they came across the glasses. Sherpa approached the same couple miles later. They gave him Paul Bunion's glasses, relating that they had found them and wanted a NOBO (northbounder) to keep an eye out (shameless- same pun) for their rightful owner. Sherpa walked about 6 miles with the glasses until the next shelter. When he got there, he shouted, did someone lose their glasses? A grateful hiker quickly presented himself. 
In exchange for the glasses, Sherpa offered the couple some beta (rock climber slangfor advice) on the next campground which they were approaching. Sherpa had noticed an ominous note left there which read ""Bear came to camp multiple times. More than one and they are persistent. Used mace and still roamed around camp for several hours after. Not much sleep last night."" They thanked him, as they had been planning to stay at that campsite. For the count, Sherpa saw several deer, two black snakes, and one black bear today. 3rd day in a row seeing a bear!","Petites Gap

 This morning we started out by making the up the short section that we skipped yesterday. It was raining in the morning and very few hikers were out. It was still raining for the second section of the hike so Sherpa carried a rain poncho and headed into the woods for his hike. Porter went to a nice coffee shop in Lexington, Va for the afternoon. We saw a bear while driving in between the first and second sections of the hike. 4 days in a row of bear sightings!
Sherpa met ""wood elf"", a ridge runner who works for the ATC and educates hikers on Leave no trace principals, at a shelter. He was heading back to the trailhead so Sherpa joined him and had a long chat about lots of things like geneologies, fairies and gnomes, pretty much anything but leave no trace. He was very nice. When we got to the top, he chatted with Porter for awhile and then gave us super awesome hiking stickers that are hard to get. The stickers commemorate 100 years of the national forest service, along with the 2016 AT thru hike.
 After finishing the hike, we went back to Lexington for the evening. The last three nights, we stayed in peaks of otter campground. Unfortunately, it did not have showers and we were ready for a hotel. We went to a park and cooked a picnic dinner, including homemade biscuits, grilled fish, sautéed spinach, beans that started out dry (we rehydrated them in a Nalgene bottle all day), and rice. We eat well! We did not expect to see another thruhiker so far from the trail but ran into one named red bear. He was a red head. He got a good meal by stumbling upon us.

Today was a shorter hiking day. We spent some time in the morning at our hotel getting laundry done, updating the blog, and catching up on sleep. When we looked at the time, there was not enough time left to do the next sequential section (a 25 mile hike with no easy roads to break it up). Instead we hiked ahead with the intent of catching the 25 mile section on Monday. We did the next section up on the trail, which was about an hour drive. The end of the hike was only a few miles from Crabtree falls, the tallest waterfall east of the Mississippi River. We hiked the falls together, a 3.5 mile roundtrip hike that was very steep. Porter's ankle held up reasonably well, but she is still sore from the sprain.
Sherpa took the time to smell the roses on today's hike. Literally. There was a patch of wild roses and he decided to sniff them. Speaking of smelling things, you know that feeling you get when you are completely alone in the woods and you let one rip really loud, only to hear a girl laughing about 10 feet away? Well, she wasn't smelling roses, and she wasn't a thru-hiker, so we will never see her again...
Tonight we stayed at the quality inn in Lexington, VA. There was a woman pacing up and down the hallways. She was quick to explain that her company gives her an incentive if her pedometer gets 7000 steps per day and she hadn't walked much today because of the travel. We invited her to hike the Appalachian Trail with us as a way to get lots of steps. She politely declined.","Reids Gap VA

Today is the summer solstice which is the longest day of the year. This means a long day of hiking is in order. We car camped near the trailhead to get an early start on this 25 mile day which we thought had no road crossings. Boyscouts let us know that a certain dirt road was passable by car so we had lunch together after 6 miles, which we appreciated. During the first few miles, Sherpa met an eagle scout who couldn't make top ramen. Fellow scouts were ready to strip him of some merit badge no doubt.
Meanwhile, Porter was chatting with a hiker while waiting for Sherpa to come back down the mountain. The hiker was 21 but looked older, like he had lived a hard life. He made it to trail days last year before getting arrested while partying. This year he is just along for the pot and skips a lot of sections. He seems to be just moral support for his friends. He brought up Noro virus and mentioned that he knows people get sick when they pass the pipe so he gets his lighter out and steralizes the end before taking a puff. Pretty creative for a druggy.
Sherpa ran into bowfire early in his afternoon hike and the two walked together most of the rest of the day. He is a 21 year old bicyclist who hasn't quite settled down yet in life. He had two friends that quit recently and he is really bummed but has been able to improve his mileage solo hiking. In fact, the day they told him, he didn't know what to do so he walked 52 miles before sleeping! Sherpa walked with him most of the last 19 miles. They chatted about everything from medicinal marijuana, to the ark of the covenant, to the orthodox practice of praying to saints. Having someone to talk to really makes the time go by faster and more enjoyably. Sherpa is looking forward to having Porter join him back on the trail.

Today was an exceptional day for wildlife sightings! Early in the day, Sherpa crossed paths with a rare albino North American bipedal primate! Later Porter surprised Sherpa by meeting him on an unmarked trail that was not in the guidebook. She had just seen a bear and was really excited because it was the first one she had seen while hiking. Together as they retraced her steps they saw three more bears together. Later, he saw another bear. And driving to a camp site, the saw another bear in the road. It was a 6 bear day!
Now, back to the White ape. Today is national pervert day. Also known as hike naked day. For some thruhikers it is a novelty to salute their shorts for a mile or two. The majority, however, do not participate. Opinions of the subject range from amusement to mild annoyance. The problem with this post Victorian paganism isn't the thru hikers. It is the creepy naturalists who come out of the woodworks to offer a different type of trail magic than we are used to. When Sherpa crossed paths with one of these animals, he was just leaving a road crossing where a family including a father, mother, young boy, and two teenage daughters were having lunch. After lunch their plan was to hike up the Appalachian Trail where they likely also had and unfortunate sighting. We sure hope that bear spray works on the trail apes as well!
Back to the bears, we learned at a visitor center today that when the black bears get too friendly, the park rangers use pellet guns to untame the Bears. Poor things. Most bears that we run across don't seem to be too frightened by people, and most people don't seem to be too frightened by the bears. There is a simple solution that doesn't require pellet guns. What if the bears started carrying human spray? Just try to picture yogi the bear with a skunk in each arm. Can't you hear him approaching one of the naturalists...

Today Sherpa began hiking on the skyline drive in Shenandoah national park. The trail crosses the road a lot. Today we saw each other 13 times! Almost every mile... The trail used to run where the road is now and was later relocated to kind of straddle it. Some hikers still just hike the road. They call it ""retro blazing"" when you hike where the trail used to be. Bowfire was planning a retro hike for instance.
Sherpa met kite, a ridgerunner who hiked the Appalachian Trail back in 2010 with his wife. Even back then, when the trail was much less busy, he chose to do a flip-flop hike to avoid the crowds. A flip flop generally means starting somewhere other than Springer Mountain Georgia, hiking north ahead of the crowds, and coming back later in the season to do the southern part of the trail. If we had it to do over, we would strongly consider a modified hike. It is so much nicer now that most of the party crowd has dissipated.
For about 2 miles of the trail today, Sherpa got hiccups. Now these were not your mild, gentle, ""fruit of the Spirit"" hiccups. These were violent, loud, and disruptive. It's always poor taste to laugh at someone to their face, but upon hearing one of his hiccups some random girl along the trail just started laughing at him. He tried running, to no avail. He tried holding his breath and avoided passing out successfully, but the hiccups remained. When he met Porter at a road crossing, she knew just the trick. People have off buttons for hiccuping. No need to drink water from a cup upside down, scare yourself, hold your breath, etc. Just try poking the afflicted person in the belly button! Oh it was aweful, he would rather still have hiccups.

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539691,"You never know where the hitched hikers might pop up! Last night, we left a house in Virginia at 1:30am and drove 6 hours to attend a ceremony in South Carolina for a friend of ours who had just joined the US army and was graduating from boot camp. The friend is a chemical engineer from Nepal who studied and worked in the US but as his visa was expiring, was going to have to leave the country. It is strange that our country's immigration policies welcome with open arms the poorest people, which are a tremendous burden to social programs, but then close the doors to productive and contributing workers. Perhaps it is all in the spirit of being the land of opportunity, with us offering hope to the poor while not robbing the poor countries of their desperately needed talent, but it is difficult when you know someone personally that has gotten to taste western culture and then has to return to poverty. Thankfully, in our friend's case, there was another option. He was able to join the US army with a needed language skill 
and apply for naturalization. 
We stayed with the aunt and uncle of one of his college friends who had also joined the military several years ago for the same reason. It was such a pleasure meeting the aunt and uncle and being welcomed into their home with very short notice. They invited us to join them for some home cooked Nepalese cuisine and stay the night. We then made the drive with their nephew, our friend's college buddy, early this morning.
The graduation ceremony was a patriotic display of our nation's military might. A military band kept us entertained during marches, awards, oaths, and other pomp. The highlight was that they granted our friend leave for one day and gave him orders to report to a base in Virginia near where we are staying. We toured an outdoor museum on the base displaying the fiercest killing machines American minds have created and then treated him to an all you can eat bbq buffet before driving 6 more hours back up to Charlottesville, trading stories of boot camp and hiking the whole time.
Back at the house, we had another delicious dinner and continued trading stories. The patriarch of the family was a former member of the British armed forces who had participated in an exchange program with the US army special forces. Now a Security consultant, he had lots of fantastic stories. His wife had converted to Christianity at some point and has started a nonprofit organization called ""Assisting Indigenous Ministries (AIM)"" which helps Christians in Southeast Asia more effectively share the gospel in places like Bangladesh, India, and Nepal.
In her home country of Nepal, about 10,000 young girls are drugged and kidnapped from villages and exported as sex slaves to places like Mumbai every year according to human trafficking statistics. Families are being tricked into thinking their daughters are being given better lives such as jobs or schooling when in reality the job they are given is no profit to them. Women who escape or age out of the business and return to Nepal come back with baggage ranging from HIV to severe emotional trauma, putting a heavy burden on the already impoverished nation whose total population is less than the greater metropolitan Houston area. The love of Christ is greater than any darkness, and God has placed this burden on her heart. God has given her a vision that includes local churches taking a lead role in showing Christ's love in a way that reduces the likelihood of desperate parents entrusting their daughters to these wicked men by providing opportunities to those poverty stricken and exploited families. Hopefully God uses her to help bring an end to the despicable practice while opening the door for the gospel in an otherwise dark place. We enjoyed chatting with this woman who God was using in such an effective way. Her way of life reminded us of the life we are called to in Micah 6:8 ""he has shown you, oh man, what the Lord requires of you, do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God""","Rockfish Gap

This morning we enjoyed fellowship our Nepalese hosts and old roommate over some ginger, pepper, garlic, and cilantro scrambled eggs. We said our see you laters over a long morning, grabbed some groceries, and drove back from Charlottesville to the Shenandoah mountains, resuming our northbound hike at 1pm. Today's section is a 20 mile southbound section which will put us back at the campground where we started hiking from on Wednesday. 
Early in the hike, someone stopped for a picture of Sherpa's green shorts. Soon after, three more section hikers named Gangster lipstick and scout took Sherpas picture as part of a scavenger hunt. They were very excited to get a picture of a thruhiker without a shirt on (supposedly it was worth bonus points...)
Near the top of a mountain, Sherpa found a small snapping turtle resting in the middle of the trail. This little guy was nowhere near a water source. Perhaps a hiker had relocated him from his natural habitat? In any case Sherpa carefully picked the critter up (they bite!) and brought him to Porter who slack packed him to an area with water. She drove him to a nearby stream and placed him well away from any trail crossings where he might accidentally catch a hitchhike to the middle of nowhere again. Some day hikers saw her and asked, what's in the shoe box (we had put him in one for safe transport)? Upon showing him, the lady exclaimed to herself audibly several times, ""what an angel"", referring to Porter.
While at a road crossing enjoying snacks, we met a hiker named crockamole. After chatting with him for a few minutes about a copperhead we had seen near where he was standing, we asked if he was a southbounder, perceiving from his gear and smell that he was a thruhiker. He replied, ""I hope not!"" Followed by several expletives upon realization that he had walked about two miles in the wrong direction. Poor guy. 
The last four miles had a special bonus- cold pouring rain! Always fun to end the day drenched. Probably God's way of telling thruhikers that they need a shower. Tempted to move fast to get through it, Sherpa thought to himself, what's the worst thing that could happen? We had heard a story from a ranger about a girl who had shamefully ended her hike by stepping into a puddle that was too deep. The result was that she broke her ankle, causing her to go into shock, during which she lost control of her bladder muscles. That was the condition the ranger found her in. Worst that could happen? Embarrassing loss of containment and broken bones. No thanks. He took his time despite the inclement conditions and made it safely to the rendezvous.","Dundo Campground

 Sherpa chatted with a few day hikers this morning. The inevitable question hit, "" you goin all the way"" followed by instant celebrity status. But the highlight of the 1st half of the hike was eating homemade grilled cheese sandwiches in a picnic area near the trail. Nothing quite like having a picnic together in a national park. After lunch, we met at bear fence trailhead for a short blue blaze (side trail) that passed through a nice rock scramble up to a 360 degree view of the park. One couple we passed joked that their daughter was trying to cash in on their life insurance by bringing them up there. It was treacherous. They also comented on Porter's wardrobe choice for the day. She chose to wear her hiking skirt. The woman was impressed stating ""Look at her in the skirt! She must be Wonder Woman to be climbing over these rocks in a skirt!""
The evening brought a different type of experience. So aside from the occasional joke about smelly through hikers, we haven't really mentioned much in this blog about hygiene. The standards of cleanliness vary greatly among thru hikers. What we are about to describe is probably an extreme, and may cause nausea in pregnant women and small children so reader beware. We ran into a hiker today that we had last seen around 600 miles ago on the trail. He was instantly recognizable from behind by his familiar odor. It was quite fun to catch up with him, but his hygiene practices are disturbing. His last bath seems to have been at Fontana dam, which is before the smoky mountains near the border of Georgia. Coincidentally, this was also the last time he did laundry. Curious about his socks, he confessed, ""yeah, I have pretty much never washed them. They're really stiff, but they seem to work still."" Then came the bombshell, ""I think I have pinworms, it itched so bad last night that I barely slept. I haven't looked yet. It's a difficult angle for me. I am considering take a picture…"". Sherpa tried to be helpful and offered up some comforting words ""some hikers don't wear underwear, maybe that would help with itching?"" The hiker was quick to jump in with the following ""oh yeah I got rid of my underwear a long time ago too. But I think I got rid of them too late. I have a fungal infection I am fighting too."" Sherpa chimed in again, ""hygiene is really important. You really ought to consider bathing occasionally and rinsing your clothes from time to time"". He asked, very sincerely, ""do you think so? Maybe I will try that."" Some hikers try to look the homeless or hippy part by not shaving or sporting dreadlocks, but he really embraces it!","Skyline Drive Mile 66.7

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540029,"Today was our 6th and last Sunday in a row that we were able to zero together while Porters ankle was recovering. Last night we splurged and enjoyed a nice night in the big meadows national park lodge. Today we were once again able to enjoy fellowship with believers. There was the welcoming church of Christ in Erwin 6 weeks ago, then the very much alive first baptist church in Damascus, the fire and brimstone country church near Bland, the church whose flame was flickering in Roanoke, the very dead church in Lexington, and today we enjoyed fellowship with christian ministry in the national park, an interdenominational ministry run mostly by college students which provides a Christian service to visitors of our national parks. They were a nice bunch. Probably the only time we will ever attend a church service where the worship team has just one instrument, a lonely ukulele. 
We had a very relaxed day, headed to a campsite early with the intent of just relaxing. If you have been following us for any length of time, you probably realize that we aren't very good at that. Despite our best efforts to the contrary, we still stumbled upon some excitement. The first site in the campground had a large contraption labeled ""bear trap"". We decided to choose a site as far away from it as possible. After getting our tent setup, we saw a bear in our neighbors campsite! It was an opportunistic cub, not more than a year old, minding his own business! After a few minutes, a few rangers drove by. We showed them a picture of the cute little guy. Their eyes lit up like a bunch of FBI agents getting a tip on some terrorists whereabouts. Soon more showed up with tranquilizers and they vanished into the woods behind the site, hot on the bear's tracks. Apparently they had been driving around looking for the little troublemaker for 8 hours! Luckily for the bear, it was almost 5pm and it would have been a lot of work to relocate the critter tonight. They claimed he was too skittish so Instead they just chased him away. We aren't convinced, they were easily within a few yards of him. They then wished us a goodnight and advised us to yell if we see him.","Off Trail

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540030,"So we overheard a tourist asking a park ranger, ""where can I hike where I won't see a bear?"" He gave a one word answer, ""home"". This morning we met at a busy store along the trail on the skyline drive called a wayside. It is a popular place to go because they have world famous blackberry milkshakes. They had ran out, and the resupply truck was being unloaded as we arrived. Apparently the shakes are popular with the Bears too because just as a jubilant northbound emerged victorious with a shake, a big bear came out of the woods right across the parking lot. We saw a total of 6 bears today, all along the road. Our favorite was a cub and its mom. The nearby mom growled something in bear to her cub that translated pretty well into any language ""get back here, there's humans nearby."" 
It was supposed to rain in the afternoon but thankfully it missed us. The down side was that we didn't get cooled off or rinsed off... and unfortunately, our national park campground, Matthews arm, did not have showers. It worked out though, because we hiked southbound from it towards the big meadows campground, which does have showers, and took them at the end of the day. When we made it back to our campsite, we had a new neighbor. Her trail name was rapunzel because she had a long braid of hair. She had hiked a lot on the AT but never as a thru hiker. We chatted a bit about all the gnats and she very kindly gave Porter her headband, which was treated with permethrin to help keep bugs out of her eyes. What a nice lady.
On the trail, Sherpa walked with Captain Planet for about an hour. Captain Planet was excited because he had heard of us but hadn't met us yet. With all the slack packing we have become quite familiar to lots of thru hikers. The conversation centered around the history of Shenandoah national park, trail life in general and how you grow as a result of walking it. Captain Planet said he had gained patience and humility, and Reflecting on how the park was built by FDR's CCC (government jobs to keep people employed during the depression era), he commented, ""I would join if they still had it."" Our friend who just graduated from the army told us that the bootcamp was the perfect place for people lacking direction. It would be nice if there was a public works program available to young people, but thankfully our country isn't desperate enough to have to have anything like that especially when you consider places like Israel where there is mandatory military service for everyone just so they can maintain their right to exist.","Hawksbill Gap - 928.6

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540031,"Today we started near mt Marshall, the last mountain above 3000 feet until Massachussettes. The Appalachian range really flattens out in the middle. Low elevations combined with summer heat, bugs, and infrequent bathing should make for a real treat. After hiking about 15 miles, the journey took us out of Shenandoah National Park where we continued for another 10. Our goal has been to reach Harper's ferry, the unofficial halfway point and headquarters for the ATC in June. 
While Sherpa was putting in the miles today, Porter saw a momma bear with her two cubs from the car. She stopped and watched them for awhile. No other cars came, it was like a special treat just for her. Eventually they wandered out of sight of the sky line drive. Thank God for the going away present from Shenandoah!
We decided to camp in a rustic campground tonight. Instead of bath houses, they have a dumpy privy. Saw a friendly looking mouse guarding the toilet hole. While in the parking lot there was a car full of smoke. A bunch of young kids piled out of it shouting ""my car is on fire!"" Curious, Sherpa walked over only to discover that they had used an e-cigarette to fill the car with smoke. They called it a ""hotbox vape"" and told us that it is something that kids do these days. Apparently, they got so much smoke in the car, they could not even see each other. They encouraged us to try it. Needless to say, that will not be happening.","Little Hogback Overlook - 954

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540190,"Hello thruhiking community! So today was our 4 month anniversary. Before reading the next paragraph, which is a passionate piece about physical health and spiritual health, we wanted to keep you from any temptation to think that we are health nuts. In reality, we don't abstain from everything that might be unhealthy based on science's current but ever changing theories of health. But we do try to refrain from a lifestyle of excess while passionately pursuing the things or the Lord. So Let's review- our one month anniversary menu included subway and dehydrated food, two months was commemorated by Fuddruckers, the third of a year mark was celebrated over a dominos pizza, and to make month 4 extra special, you guessed it, today we dined in at McDonald's. Never mind that they accidentally packaged it to go. We feel like we really set the bar though on Valentine's Day this year, two weeks before our wedding, by taking the Waffle House up on their romance package (the sign out front ""now accepting reservations for Valentine's Day""). Let's face it, nothing says I love you like eggs fried in lard accompanied by a waffle cake slathered in high fructose corn syrup, accompanied by a healthy scoop of partially hydrogenated vegetable spread. So in practice, we eat the modern American menu now and then. Not romantic, you say? Who can argue with a $2 frappacino, any size? Well, we have years to raise the bar! Maybe one day we will make it to a fine dining establishment like Taco Bell to celebrate, and besides, after walking 25 miles in 90+ degree weather, including a section of trail known as the roller coaster because it crosses 10 mountain peaks in 13 miles, you would probably add 5 packets of salt to your supersized French fry as well!Now for our rant on physical and spiritual health as promised. We passed the 1000 mile mark today! That is officially more than most sedantary Americans could hope to walk in a year, even armed with a pedometer. Coincidentally, if you are looking for a walking goal that will have a meaningful impact on your health, try walking one mile for each year since Jesus came to his own, and then was rejected by them. This year, you would need to walk 2016 miles, which is about 5-6 miles a day, the gold standard for walking your way to health. You always hear diet and exercise touted as the best medicine, but does it work? We led a health clinic in Mexico last year for some missionary friends of ours and for our home church back in the states in which we told people their cholesterol levels, blood sugar, blood pressure, BMI, etc. Of the over 150 people that we screened, there were only two perfect scores. One was an older woman who walked over 5 miles a day to get to work, drank lots of water (instead of coke which is common in that part of Mexico), and avoided fried food like the plague (she ran an empanada stand and had gotten sick of that flavor). And on top of that, she looked healthy! She had two daughters, one who kept to the moms lifestyle and also had perfect scores, and another who didn't like walking as much, ate the typical Mexican diet, and had numbers out of the recommended healthy ranges. Now there were a few Americans that caressed their numbers inside of healthy ranges with the assistance of modern medicine, but that just masks the underlying health problems by addressing symptoms. You can be clinically obese and get out of breath going up a set of stairs but have perfect blood sugar thanks to medicine, but don't kid yourself into thinking you're just as healthy as someone who isn't addicted to a pill. The quality of life produced by drugs can't compare to someone who doesn't have to ask a doctors permission to enjoy the activities of life. We as a nation are kidding ourselves into thinking drug companies can produce health. But there is something far more important than our physical health, and that is our spiritual health. Paul discusses this in his first letter to Timothy (ch4 vs 8) when he says that training the body has some benefit, but Godliness is of value in every way. Increasing in godliness should be a top priority for every follower of Christ. The quality of life that godliness produces is incomparable to any other in this world. And just like there are pills that give the appearance of physical health, there are many who kid themselves into thinking that some good work, perhaps church attendance, is sufficient to maintain spiritual health. Jesus discusses those people in Matthew 7 when he says regarding the final judgement ""on that day MANY will say to me Lord... And I will say to them depart from me I never knew you"". So what does growing in godliness look like? 2 Peter 1 gives us a pretty good path. Peter says, add virtue to your faith (clean up the filth in your heart), then add knowledge (read and memorize the bible), become more self controlled and patient, then add godliness (literally be like Christ), which should result in kindness to your fellow man and true love. Are you closer to the Lord this month than you were last month? What fruit is God bearing in your life as evidence that you actually are a child of His? Or are you just taking a weekly church and good works pill to appear spiritually healthy when in reality you couldn't make it up one set of spiritual stairs (some little trial) without collapsing spiritually?","VA 55 Manassas Gap - 977.3

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540319,"Today marked the end of the 500+ mile tree canopy that has been the source of ""The Virginia Blues"" for many thruhikers with the achievement of walking into a Harper's Ferry, West Virginia. For those of you with really bad geography, West Virginia is a different state than Virginia (we had at least one confused reader). Harper's Ferry is the location of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters, and is the unofficial halfway point of the trail. The ATC takes pictures of all the hikers. Unfortunately, we arrived after they were closed so that will have to wait. Our goal has been to reach it by June and we are thrilled to make it, even if it is the 11th hour, figuratively speaking.Thinking back, the reputation of Virginia isn't deserved. It was a beautiful section of trail, including wild ponies on the balds of mt Rogers, the Virginia creeper trail, the cliffs near McAfee's knob, the overlooks of the blue ridge parkway, and Shenanndoah national park. Many miles of beautiful hiking. As for the rest of the trail, we are happy to announce that Porter will be once again donning her backpack! We will be taking the week of forth of July off. and then hit the trail again together. Right now it is looking good for us with about half of the miles complete, half of our time used up, and half of our money spent! Keep an eye out for us, you never know where the hitched hikers might pop up next!And reflecting on the first half of our epic honeymoon, we have had ups (like finishing the Smokies earlier than planned and getting to go to Dollywood before heading to a wedding) and downs (like when Porter sprained her ankle). We have experienced incredible kindness from strangers, like when Martian drove us 2 hours out of her way to a random dirt road trail crossing. We have been able to bless others (hikers love free food).   We have made new friends. We have been able to use the time to establish a deep relationship with each other based on an ever deepening love and submission to out of a reverence for Christ. Have there been sacrifices? Of course! Have there been changes to plans? Sure. We thought we'd have half the gospel of John memorized. And then there were the priceless moments, like the time that we put a new spin on the old saying, 'save water, shower with a friend' when we also saved $1.75 in quarters observing the practice in a pay by the minute shower (well, almost priceless)! And while we might have chosen a different way (like backpacking together the whole time instead of slack packing the last 700 miles) we have seen God's hand at every turn. After all, the great truth in scripture about believers is that the righteous shall live by faith. We don't walk by sight. God guides, and His ways are not our ways. And we trust him for the second half of our honeymoon, and the rest of our lives together, no matter what lies ahead.","Bears Den Hostel - 1002.6

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541847,"We're back! We had a wonderful time in Florida enjoying beaches for the last week. A highlight was seeing a Manatee in the wild. We also got to see one in captivity during a small town America 4th of July parade where they crowned the contest winner ""miss manatee 2016"". What an unfortunate but humorous title for a beauty pageant winner. We also met a really nice couple in church that was visiting from Maine. Hopefully we can see them when we get there. Apparently there are plentiful lobster that frequent their dinner table... 
We had a fun time but were looking forward to getting back to the trail. Upon returning via DC, we got to have lunch with a middle school friend of Sherpa's, visit the air and space museum, and stay with some of Porters old church friends. It was while staying with them that we made an important ""investment"" decision. Unfortunately, Porters ankle just isn't ready for sustained big days yet. For now, we are still going have to car camp and slack pack. it, which means we needed to replace one piece of gear which has become woefully inadequate for the summer months. The cooler we have been using was missing a latch, had one hinge wired together, had a permanent screw sealing off the drain, and was stamped ""Seewald"" in honor of its previous owner's last name. All of that would have been tolerable were it not for its poor ice retention characteristics which resulted in daily ice purchases and lots of spoiled chocolate milk. Which leads us to our new ice chest, ""Seewald the Second"", a yeti cooler! His claim to fame of course is that ""you'll never have to buy ice again"" or something like that. The only downside of course is that yetis are so expensive, we will be eating rice and beans for the rest of the summer which of ironically requires no refrigeration.
While disappointing that Porter is still off the trail, the good news is that we are going to be able to continue visiting churches each week. This week we went with Porters friends to a mega church! The pastor braved the topic of police brutality to a very ethnically diverse congregation which was respectable. We were running a few minutes short of on time, which meant we had to sit in the nosebleed section of the enormous facility to enjoy the fellowship. We were thankful to be in a full church that was alive, and besides, it's better to be a ""back row baptist"" than a ""bedside baptist"".","Off Trail

Since the ATC headquarters were closed when we arrived on June 30th, we headed over to explore their visitor center. They take a picture of all the thruhikers and keep them in a book. It was fun to flip through and see all the hikers we have been meeting along the way. Kind of like a high school year book. The trail took us out of West Virginia and into Maryland.
On the trail today, met a section hiker going 500 miles from Shenandoah to Massachussetees. Apparently she had gotten separated from her teenage som and daughter and their family dog. She gave this message to pass along ""tell him his new trailname is ""dead meat""!"" Sherpa dutifully passed on the message. The son responded ""his name is dead weight, not dead meat"" pointing to the dog. I told him that I didn't think she was referring to the dog...
 in the evening, we hiked together to a monument built in honor of George Washington in 1827. It looked a little bit like a light house. We chatted with a family that was doing a day hike. When they realized we hadn't made arrangements for the night yet, they offered, ""you can set up your tent in our yard."" What awesome hospitality. They even ordered pizzas to share with us! Yum! The highlight was of course the pets. Two dogs, 5 cats, a tank full of fish, a lonely hamster, and a potbellied pig! While eating dinner, the pig opened the back door and let himself in to join us.

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541849,"This morning, we enjoyed watching the pot bellied pig mosey around the back yard as we ate our breakfast. We checked our ice supply for day 3 since the last purchase and ""Seewald the second"" (our new cooler) has not let us down yet! We then hit the trail again midway through Maryland. The section in Maryland is fairly short. Some hikers will do what is called the four state challenge in which they start in Virginia, and proceed to hike through West Virginia, Maryland, and into Pennsylvania all in the same day (approx 44 miles). It would have been a fun challenge, but timing didn't work out with our 4th of July trip. 
That said, we crossed the Mason Dixon line and finished the day together in Pennsylvania! We are officially in the North. We enjoyed hiking on the ""Apple latchin' trail"" (the common southern pronunciation) and the famous Southern hospitality that came along with it. While we live in Texas, neither of us our from the South. Reflecting on the culture, there was one thing that bothered us. We were disgusted by the racism that still haunts our country. Not everyone in the south is racist of course, but there were plenty of reminders of the wicked past and present afflicting our country. Dixie flags, highly offensive to African Americans, are defiantly waved in every city. This region that is referred to as the Bible Belt has chosen not to imitate Paul in direct disobedience to our command to do just that. Paul said, ""I become all things to all people in order to save some"". Being intentionally offensive is not going to show anyone the love of Christ unless the thing that is offensive about you is the righteousness of Christ in you. Followers of Christ are to have nothing to do with any offensive symbol other than the cross. Not convinced that racism is still a problem? There was the town we stayed in with the billboard (very recently removed) which said ""if your ass is brown, get out of town, before sundown."" There was the city we passed where the ""Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan"" lives. And then there was the family we visited who commented ""southerners are nice to people who look like them"". This family didn't look southern. We really enjoyed the hospitality, and hope that it is some day it is available to everyone, but know that the only hope for this world is Jesus Christ, where hate is overcome and there is neither ""Jew not Gentile, male or female, but all are one in Christ"". The only separation God recognizes is light from darkness (John 1), i.e. good from evil. Martin Lither King Jr said it best, ""I have a dream that one day a man will be judged not by the color of his skin, but by the content of his character."" As we become more like Christ, all of our biases are replaced with love for a Saviour who separated us from our sinful past regardless of the color of our skin, the language we speak, our gender, etc. We saw great examples of this too- the Indian family near Damascus Virginia that picked up homeless people, the ""predominantly white"" church in Johnson City that had partnered with their ""lower income (predominantly black and Hispanic)"" schools, the ethnically diverse church in Washington, D.C. that wasn't afraid to discuss racism, and our encouraged knowing that Jesus Christ is working in this world to heal the brokenness!
On a lighter note, it's time for a beard update! Some of you may have noticed that we stopped posting a weekly beard picture some time ago. The fact is that after the initial transformation from ""shaved adult male"" face typical of Western culture which worships youthful appearance to ""wooly mammoth face"" more common in the Arctic and Eastern cultures which place a higher value on warmth or age, the changes are hard to detect on a weekly basis. In addition, there are plenty of pictures of the beard. Today is significant however because it represents the approximate halfway point of the beard, which is now 16 weeks old and will be removed at 30 weeks. The beard has many benefits, such as keeping non-wifeys away, scaring children, giving something to stroke while deep in contemplation, storing food for later use, acceptance among the hiker community, etc. There is, however, one major drawback to the lack of grooming, the tickling factor associated with an untrimmed mustache. When presented with an offer to keep it trimmed to rest respectably above the top lip in exchange for a reprieve from the occasional belly button assault, Porter replied ""I'm keeping the belly button."" Needless to say, there will be no relief in sight from the nostril tickling, food absorbing 'stache. It is now . Dont worry, all you beard fans, it remains unscathed. 
 We were especially reminded of God's faithfulness today. Porter went to meet Sherpa and found a nice log to sit in while waiting for him. Something about the seat wasn't right so she decided to keep walking a few more yards and found a different one. When we met up, we saw a tree fall on the first seat! Isn't it great to remember that God is in control of our lives?
During the hike, we ran into several hikers we knew. We saw sunshine (Was calling him the wrong name- spaceman, in previous posts) and his new traveling friend Alyssa who just started and is going to hike to Maine with him. She seemed like an upgrade from his previous traveling companion, a black lab. Apparently, He dropped the dog at home because Pennsylvania has a reputation for being really rocky. We also saw Pocahontas walking with Dusty. They told us that Skooch flip flopped and is hiking South from Maine. Hopefully we see her on our way North. We have also started to see Southbounders who started in Maine.","US 40 - 1045.4

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542033,"After watching our potbellied friend one last time as we enjoyed our breakfast (no, we didn't eat bacon), we hit the road again, this time in Pennsylvania. The reputation of Pennsylvania is that it is very rocky. We shall see. After lunch, there was a section of trail that was very steep. Ominously, someone had put a black diamond on the sign approaching that section of trail which read ""most difficult"" like you would see at a ski resort. It's just a walk in the woods, isn't it? How difficult can it really be? Not bad at all, at least for now. The trail leveled out after a few tenths of a mile and was wide and flat for most of the rest of the day. And what a day it was. It was actually the longest day yet at 26.6 miles. We are moving fast right now! One neat thing about Pennsylvania is that the lack of elevation (mostly below 2000ft) seems to be offset by the higher latitude when it comes to plant life. We saw rhododendrons in bloom today, along with numerous mountain laurels that had recently bloomed. These plants were done blooming a month ago further south and we didn't see as many at lower elevations.
 On the trail, Sherpa chatted with ""Twinkle Toes"", a fellow northbound thruhiker who started in late April. He was in his early 30's, had recently lost his job and broke up with a long time girlfriend. Never hiked before, he decided to hit the trail to clear his mind. The conversation lasted several miles and reminded Sherpa of the brokenness in this world. This is a story we have heard over and over again while on the trail over the last few months with slightly different details. Praying he finds healing while taking this step back from life. 
If there was only one thing we took away from our hike, it would be the incredible amount of hurting and brokenness that surrounds us this side of glory right here in the United States. It's really easy to spend time with people who appear to have it all together, while unconsciously pushing away or avoiding the ones who don't. It's comfortable. But is that how Jesus lived? Wasn't he called a friend of sinners? Sadly, when he walked the earth, he found the religious people of that day in love with their comforts and shunning those who needed Gods love most. And worst of all, they rejected the teachings of Jesus. Would he find religious people of today any different? Luke 16:14 says that they ridiculed him, because they were lovers of money. It then goes on and really speaks to us today, challenging us to question the American Dream of consumption with the words ""For what is exalted among men, is an abomination in the sight of God."" (A friend texted that verse to us today- hope it challenges you too). It's really a fascinating dilemma that some Christians find themselves in. There is such outstanding wisdom in the word of God that produces a very comfortable life. For example, simple obedience to the command not to be controlled by any substance but to be under the influence of the Holy Spirit means a faithful believer won't do drugs and won't get drunk which will save them an incredible amount of money and heartache. The dilemma of course is that some people fall in love with the blessings that come with obedience instead of falling deeper in love with the God who blesses and there is a tendency to seek after the blessing rather than the blesser. And there is a broken and hurting world a few footsteps away and an eternity away. Probably why in the same chapter, Jesus points out that it is impossible to pursue both God and money while urging us to use our physical resources on others ""to be welcomed by them in eternal mansions"" (i.e. using money in ways that result in others getting saved). And he's not just telling religious people to check a box by dropping a check in an offering plate. He's telling us to have the same love for people that he does and to show them the love that we have received so they might find hope and healing. And for us to use everything at our disposal to that end.
 While on the topic of financial stewardship, did you know that Little Ceasars has an $8 deep dish pizza that is actually quite good? Big enough for one thruhiker and his wife! We liked it so much a few days ago that we had it again today. Alright, there might be something in the water... we had crazy bread yesterday.

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542196,"Shortly after getting on the trail, we came across the official halfway point for 2016. Every year, the length of the trail changes slightly due to reroutes, the addition of switchbacks, etc. In fact, the trail is almost 60 miles longer now then it was just 30 years ago. This year, the halfway point is at mile 1094.55.   To celebrate the accomplishment, many thruhikers mark their victory by attempting the half gallon challenge! One half gallon of ice cream that is! The current record holder finished in just 8 minutes. Apparently, a 1/2 gallon wasn't enough because someone ate a whole gallon in about 20 minutes. Sherpa wasn't hungry after finishing the first half, but he was up for the challenge! The store near the halfway point carries 1.5 quart sized buckets of Hershey's ice cream. If you finish that, you get a tall cup with the other half quart to bring it up to a half gallon. Sherpa started with Mint Chocolate Chip. Porter, who chose not to participate, warned that it might be a mistake because of the chunks. Even the attendant at the front desk tried to steer him towards an easier option with ""Neopolitan is the most popular choice."" They were right but to no avail. Those chips were so chewy, they would have slowed down Chewbacca. The second course was raspberry, better texture, worse flavor. 53 minutes later, the deed was done.   There will be no gallon challenge in Maine. To prevent immediate onset diabetes from his 2,564 calorie snack, Sherpa quickly hit the trail to begin burning the calories.Along the trail, the shelters are noticeably nicer the further North you get. For those who are unfamiliar with the AT, there are 3 sided shelters every 5-10 miles of the trail that you can sleep in on a first come first serve basis. Most of them have a simple floor made of lumber and a roof that hopefully doesn't leak. There is also usually a picnic table in the vicinity and a contained fire ring. The last few shelters have boasted a wide range of amenities. One had a pavilion over its picnic table. Several were adorned with nice metal roofs. One boasted hardwood floors. The best by far though had an ""innkeeper"" and potter flower hanging baskets!   There is still one feature that deters some hikers from making use of them. Earlier, before the spring break party crowd quit, these shelters were infested with mice high on second hand pot smoke. This calms the mice down nicely as everyone is winding down, but inevitably they get the munchies after everyone is aslpeep, creating quite a nuisance for the hikers. The shelter mice are still present, although most are suffering withdrawals now as the party atmosphere has noticeably died down. Noticing a very fancy fire ring today, Sherpa stopped at one today where a thruhiker was chatting with a ridge runner named Jukebox. The thruhiker asked Sherpa three questions, ""are you a thru hiker? (No backpack)"" and after hearing yes, ""do you smoke weed?"", and after hearing no, ""do you have any paper? (To roll a joint)"". Sadly, the only assistance that Sherpa could offer was the emergency supply of toilet paper in his left pocket, which the hiker politely declined to the amusement of the ridge runner. Sorry shelter mice, maybe someone else better equipped will come along so you guys can have your fix! (BTW, later on we showed the hiker our commentary and he got quite a kick out of this paragraph. He then borrowed a red bull can from someone nearby and fashioned a bong).","Shippensburg Road - 1093.2

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542244,"Today's section continued through Flatsylvania, passing through numerous corn and soybean farms. Temperatures soared into the mid 90s, so it was only appropriate that we passed through a city called Boiling Springs. Actually, it is a charming Appalatian Trail community known for their springs of cold bubbling water which fills a shallow, crystal clear lake inhabited by ducks, geese, and swans. We passed ""little jo"", whom we hadn't seen since Shenandoah! While catching up, he told us that he knew he was in the North when people started having snowblowers in their garages. Reflecting on his experience in the South, he shared a story that we somehow missed but now feel obligated to share. Near the city of Erwin, TN, where Porter twisted her ankle, a circus visited in the 1916. An elephant named Mary (or murderous Mary) trampled one of her trainers to death during a show. The animal, found guilty of murder, was then hung him with a crane in front of several thousand spectators! 100 years later, Ringling Brothers chose to do away with their elephants this year due to anti circus legislation that was popping up around the country, making it more difficult for them to schedule their shows. Also this year, many took to social media, bemoaning the death of a primate when a child visiting the zoo got into its cage. Some blamed the parents, others blamed the zoo. And again this year, a 2 year old boy was eaten alive by an alligator while visiting Disney World, evoking outrage and triggering an alligator hunt. The events of today and of a century ago raise fascinating questions. How should we value human life in relation to animals? What responsibility do animals have for their actions? Thankfully, as followers of Christ, we have a place to turn, the word of God. While the law of Moses was given to an agrarian, preindustialized society, the principals of jurisprudence contained in it are full of wisdom that is applicable today. Exodus 21:28-32 instructs us perfectly on what justice demands in those types of situations. Bloodshed of a human always requires blood to satisfy justice. In the example, if an oxen gores someone to death, it's life was then demanded (and not just as a dinner- eating it was forbidden). The passage then deals with cases of negligence by the owner of the animals involved. Owners are responsible for ensuring protection of human life from animals that have a history of agression towards people. Now if the owner of murderous Mary was hanging beside her from that crane, the Ringling brothers would have probably eliminated elephants from their shows long ago. And by the way, if Seaworld's CEO knew that he would be held responsible for Shamu's agression towards trainers, there would have been no need for a sequel to Free Willy. Ok maybe those are extreme examples, but the importance of protecting human life from agression animals, and holding those responsible who fail to protect humans should still instruct us today on how to respond when these incidents occur. And the question of how to value human lives against animals is ultimately settled by Jesus, when he asks us in Matthew 6 to consider the birds of the air and then reminds us that we are more valuable to our father in heaven then they are and if he takes care of them, he can be trusted to take care of us.Speaking of animal lives, we learned about a new type that lives along the trail. They are called Pokemon! The town where we saw little jo is home to an Appalachian trail conservancy building that serves as a focal point for hikers. Apparently, it also draws another unexpected crowd, school kids out for the summer.   Wondering what could possibly be interesting enough about hiking that the video game generation would leave their air conditioned couches for a stroll in the great outdoors, we flagged down a skateboarder playing on his phone while flying down the street. Without slowing down, he shouted over to us, ""I need more Pokemon balls"". After reaching the conservancy, he flipped around and went back to his friends. Pokemon? Apparently there is a new game that the kids have glommed on to that is played from the phone. Basically, you walk around in the real world and try to catch these little creatures called Pokemon that appear on your screen while you walk. You need a special ball to catch them, and if you run out of those balls, you can get more by walking near the Appalachian Trail Conservancy building. Sherpa quickly downloaded the game, curious if any of these creatures could be found along the trail. Stopping by the conservancy, he loaded up on balls and returned to his walk in the woods. Alarmed, Porter showed Sherpa an article about a man who crashed into a tree while playing Pokemon go. To make matters worse, this guy was driving a car, not walking. Apparently adults play the game too. Luckily, the only crash Sherpa experienced was his phone, which froze repeatedly due to glitches in the game. After bagging a few of these imaginary critters on the trail, he threw a Pokemon ball at Porter and bagged the rarest and most beautiful Pokemon in the world!","Whiskey Spring Road, Pa - 1115.0

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542803,"There is a Jewish saying that goes something like this: when God created the world, he sent out two angels with buckets of rocks to distribute evenly over the earth. One of the angels did as he was commanded, but the other one was lazy and just dumped all of the rocks in Israel. Having been to Israel and now Pennsylvania, we think there might of been a third angel…. No wonder hikers call it ""Rocksylvania""! 
In the morning, Sherpa traversed a 10 mile section of rocks. It was nice to be back in the woods and out of the exposed sun that came along with yesterday's corn and soybean fields. Presumably, the rocks make farming this part of the countryside impossible which is why there are woods here to hike in. He did get turned around once, which resulted in an extra mile or two, it happens to the best of us. We then saw each other for lunch in the once thriving metropolis of Duncannon. The town could use some renewal and beautification. It was the type of place that would not have felt safe to walk through alone at night. In fact, it has a reputation as the only town along the trail with an operating strip club in walking distance. Hopefully the trail will have a positive economic impact on the town over the coming years. After passing through the town, Sherpa crossed another 6 mile rock patch and had a break with Porter. They both saw snakes on the trail today. To finish the day, there was a 10 mile section with no road access. This section was also a giant rock patch. Since it was getting late in the day, he decided to bring his headphones and do some trail running to finish the week strong. Meanwhile, Porter decided to meet him on the trail, but she accidentally walked north instead of south. Realizing her mistake, she turned around after about a mile going in the wrong direction. See it really does happen to the best of us… We met each other at the car just before dark. We are both very much looking forward to a day of rest tomorrow.","PA850 Valley Road- 1137.6

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542804,"We decided to see what simple living was like, so we headed down to Lancaster, PA home to lots of Amish, Mennonite, and other ""plain people"" communities. We visited a church by one of the groups (hint- they had a website and didn't require the women to wear Victorian length skirts or bonnets). The pastor used the service to report out on a recent denominational conference. Sadly, his takeaway from the event seemed to be that the unrest in the world and the racial divisions in America today were present at the highest levels of his denomination based on insensitive remarks several speakers made that sparked a rebuke from someone and caused someone else to walk out. It was a sad reminder that Christian churches are some of the most segregated places in the United States. A few years ago, Sherpa had two older roommates, one was a Hispanic immigrant of Mexican descent, the other was Caucasian. Both were working as day laborers for industry. Both claimed to be Christian. Sadly, after a while, the white roommate made the Hispanic feel unwelcome to the point where he would just go in his room whenever the white one came home, because the white one frequently turned on Foxnews and lamented the lack of a fence. This behavior sure put up an invisible one. What blatant disobedience to such a simple command ""Love one another"". Thankfully, there are many good churches where diversity is received with love.
Leaving the place of worship, we headed to a restaurant! This place seemed to do a pretty good job when it came to race. We sat at a table with a black family and a Hispanic family to enjoy an all you can eat family style meal. How different that meal might have been if instead of being all you can eat, everyone got different helpings based on their race and if some weren't given any silverware... There probably would have been a lot of tension, and some people might have even started wearing ""waiter lives matter"" shirts. Ironically, something eerily similar to this actually did happen in a church in Corinth back in the first century. You can read about it in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34. Basically, when the church met, some people would eat like gluttons and even get drunk in a perverse celebration of the Lords supper, while others who had nothing would go home hungry and humiliated causing factions and division. Paul rebuked them, saying they weren't even worthy to have communion with that kind of behavior and that Gods judgement would be poured out on them if they wouldn't correct it. Healthy reminders for the Christians of this nation.
After leaving the restaurant we passed a lot of buggies on our way to tour the Hershey chocolate factory. We then settled in early for a nice rest.","Off Trail

Sherpa brought his trekking poles, but thankfully, this section of trail wasn't nearly as rocky as the previous one although it did cross some shale deposits. The highlight for Sherpa was seeing a rattlesnake in the wild!
In the evening, there was a powerful rainstorm that caused us to lose satellite signal in our hotel room right in the middle of Melania Trump's speech during the opening night of the Republican National Convention. We don't typically watch TV, especially politics, but the spectacle was irresistible! Where else can you see Calvin Klein underwear models give praise to Jesus and Donald Trump in the same breath on live TV? On second thought, maybe we would have been better off in a tent despite the heavy downpour... While on that topic, we have nothing against TV, the news, politics, etc. just like we have nothing against McDonalds... where a little bit is alright, but it better not be the only thing you put into your belly. And a little bit of the media is alright, but it better not be the only thing you put into your mind and heart. Jesus talks about this in Matthew 6:22-23 when he tells us that ""the eye is the lamp of the body, and if the eye is healthy, the whole body will be full of light, but if it is bad, your body will be full of darkness."" The basic idea is that our eyes are gateways that let either light or darkness into our lives. If we constantly set them on the cares of this world rather than on the things of heaven, our heart and mind will become just like the world. And he says this a few breaths after telling his followers to let their light shine in this dark world so people will see their good works and give God glory! It is very easy to be influenced instead of being an influencer. It is really critical for followers of Jesus, especially in this age of information saturation, to guard our eyes from being inundated with evil things. If we don't, the things that might once have shocked us become expected, then tolerated, then accepted and sometimes embraced and our light stops shining. But we are called to be ambassadors to a world that is starving for truth. If a powerful nation sent ambassadors to a weak nation with terms for peace, some of the ones dying in the conflict would be glad to know that they could find peace and save their lives. But if those ambassadors got comfortable in the weak nation and failed to relay terms for reconciliation because the terms were unpopular, and instead said everything was ok, they would cause more harm then if they had never been sent.

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542919,"Yet another beautiful day in Rocksylvania! The rain last night left everything fresh and renewed, although there were no puddles offering direct evidence since the ground was dry and thirsty. Today we hit several milestones. We got to mile 1200, and even more cool, we passed 1189.1 along the way to it. As of that point, we now have less than a thousand miles to go! Let the countdown begin! 
At a crossing along the way, we saw ""nooner"" looking for a hitch into town to do laundry and pickup a package from the post office. We had last seen him on our first night camping in the Smokies. Back then he was taking a zero due to an injury. We are so glad that he recovered and has made it so far. He is a young guy, really nice. He got his trailname because he rarely starts hiking before noon. Porter offered him a ride, which he gladly accepted while Sherpa marched forward. Nooner told porter that yesterday was his longest hiking day yet at 34 miles, 5 of which were attributable to an off trail excursion to Wendy's…. We try hard to resist the temptation to turn our blog into a food diary, but will shamelessly brag about our thruhiking comrades when they go an extra five miles on top of a 29 mile day just for Wendy's. It seems silly to point out, but eating is so much more satisfying when you are hungry! Speaking of longest days, today was Sherpa's longest walk yet. He walked over 30 miles, which includes several miles of approach trails to reach the Appalachian trail from the car and vice versa.
A little later, Sherpa saw JT! He is plugging along slowly but surely. Lately he has been hiking in the evenings and at night to avoid the heat of the day. There are some downsides to this approach. Last night during the rain he had trouble seeing and missed the shelter he wanted to stop in.

Later on we start to notice the bug bites, blisters begin to remind us of their presence, joint aches and muscle soreness beg for attention, the sun beats down on us, we start to worry about whether we have enough water to make it to the next source, and sometimes all of the hindrances screaming for our attention distract us from the beauty that surrounds us. Thankfully, we don't have to be hiking in the forest to hear the birds, and we can choose to bless the Lord even after the birds stop singing. 
After enjoying the beautiful morning stroll, Sherpa met up with Porter, who had been shopping for some cards to send various friends. She picked him up in front of a large piece of anthracite next to a sign for a railroad that served reading! Perhaps this was the ""Reading Railroad""? They shared a cake batter milkshake which Porter really enjoyed. Ironically, ice cream just hasn't done much for Sherpa since the half gallon challenge... On the trail again in the afternoon, Sherpa ran into a day hiker wearing a bug net over his face. After chatting a few minutes, he declared, ""you've found your trail angel for the day"" and handed him the net. Thanks trail angel! Praying God will Bless you richly!

We have been in hotels too long. There just haven't been good places to camp in Pennsylvania.

While we really aren't picky, this hotel left some things to be desired. When we came into the lobby last night, it smelled terribly of marijuana smoke. We tried to remain optimistic. When we went to our room, the door had been propped open, which was a little strange so we asked the front desk if there was a reason. We received keys to a different room. Upon opening the door the room smelled so badly of marijuana smoke that we asked to have our original room back. We went back to the first room and made ourselves comfortable. It was an average room and met our expectations. Around 11:30 someone was trying to get into our room. They tried a key multiple times. We thought this was strange but we tried to ignore it. Then the front desk came and banged on the door and asked who we were and why we were in the room. We produced our receipt and told them we had booked the room for the night. He was satisfied with this and left. Apparently the girl at the front desk didn't put it in the system properly so they had tried to assign our room to someone else. After the ordeal, Porter didn't sleep well all night. 
We went to the complimentary hotel breakfast, all of them seem the same to us. We were going to have cereal. After blessing our food we each took a bite and realized the milk had spoiled, not the most pleasant experience. We then decided dry cereal was the best option this morning. After breakfast we headed back to the trail. This hotel left a bad taste in our mouth, pun intended.
Starting out the day, we had two mileage plans in place. We like to have an alternate in case we have extra daylight and Sherpa has extra energy at the end of the day. Today, we are keeping our shorter day as the terrain was very rocky and Sherpa was tired this morning during his hike, probably due to our breakfast choice. We've learned our lesson. Today, although not the hottest day we've seen, seemed to make both of us sluggish. 
Today, Sherpa had little climb up some small mountains/hills. On the way up there were some very beautiful overlooks with incredible views. We are both saddened that it seems as though many of the pretty overlooks in this state have been vandalized with spray paint. At least some of the vandals are patriotic, there was a large image of an American flag at one of the sights. 
Today had longer segments with no road crossings for Sherpa and Porter to meet up. There were only two places where we could spend time together. At each of the places Sherpa got a nice long break in an air conditioned car. We are so thankful that Sherpa is able to do the trail like this. At the second crossing, Sherpa stayed a little longer to charge his phone and cool off as it so hot out. 
While we were there a few hikers showed up. Sherpa asked if they needed anything. They asked for water which we gave them. They were so grateful for the water as it was scarce on the previous section. We were thinking about how that compares to the Living Water. We all have an unquenchable thirst that can only be satisfied by Jesus Christ, the Living Water. When we drink of the Living Water, we thirst no more. Our desires are no longer the things of this life, no longer the things that this world has to offer; but instead are things eternal, things of God. If only we all so freely shared the Living Water when we saw someone spiritually thirsty as we share physical water with those who are parched.

He (or she) was the only one that we saw on the trail so far. He was an appropriate ambassador for the state's final section of the trail. They look friendly from a distance, but if you dare get close, you will discover another side. While Pennsylvania might look easy if you just check an elevation profile map, once you step foot, you discover that it has a different side- infrequent water and rocks more suited for a mountain goat than a mountain man. There are state flowers and birds. If states had ice cream flavors, Pennsylvanias would be ""Rocky Road."" The views from overlooks were pastoral or industrial, a kind of beauty the trail would be incomplete without. The kindness of the hiking community was present at nearly every road crossing, where gallon jugs of water were lovingly placed. We of course didn't touch this precious commodity, since we have our car with, but for the backpacking thruhikers, the trail would have been impossible without it due to long sections without springs. We did our best to zoom through the area with most days exceeding 20 miles. Next up- New Jersey.
After setting foot in New Jersey, we soon crossed the 1300 mile mark! New Jersey really greets you with a spectacular view, with the trail leading through the Deleware Water Gap, where a river cuts right through a mountain leaving steep rocky banks that rise up for hundreds of feet. Contrary to the wisdom of a college friend from ""Longg"" Island who liked to trash talk the state for an aroma originating from a landfill somewhere on the Jersey side of the Hudson, it actually smells pretty good here (except of course for the occasional thruhiker). Combined with the weekend and proximity to major population centers, it also made for crowded trails, complete with several bus loads of Asian tourists sporting fancy cameras. In their honor, Sherpa used a digital filter on his iPhone to shoot today's pictures!

After grabbing a cheesesteak and visiting a church called Calvary chapel Philly that faithfully preached our need for Jesus, we ended up in the heart of Philadelphia, set to begin hosting the Democratic National Convention tomorrow. They say it's always Sunny in Philadelphia, and with a heat index well over 100F, it was a furnace.

One of our personal heros in the Bible is Noah, a man of faith, a preacher of righteousness, and of course a boat builder. One of the greatest lessons from his life is that he exerted his freedom to think. And did he ever think differently! And consider this, out of the whole world with doubtless millions of people, he alone was right. He didn't just go with the flow. Even though every single human being on earth believed the wrong thing, he remained faithful to what he knew was true. Think about it, no one but his immediate family got into that ark. How many had he preached to in the 600 years that he lived before the flood? None of them were spared from God's wrath... If he were pastoring a church, it would not have had one baptism in 600 years! No one else got on the boat. Just a few of his crazy thoughts are as follows:
 1) God cannot be approached without a blood sacrifice
 2) God's wrath was coming on the whole world
 3) That obedience means something to the Lord. (Imagine just for a second if he believed that God's wrath was coming, but then didn't bother obeying God by building the ark! There would be a lot of lonely fish and empty forests after the flood without any people or animals to keep them company.) 
The bottom line is that it is ok for people to have different thoughts and opinions. God allowed it on earth back then, and he allows it now. God will be the final judge of the thoughts and intents of our hearts, we don't have to be the judge of everyone else, even when we are right. Our beliefs don't need suicide bombs attached to them as a means of coercion. Think about it, Jesus when he was dying on the cross, cried out, ""father forgive them, they don't know what they are doing."" Jesus was surely right, but instead of judging and condemning them, he expresses a desire for reconciliation. And praise God we have such protection extended to us in America to preach righteousness to this world. That flood was just an example of what is to come for everyone who chooses to rebel against God to their dying breath. He sent Jesus as a blood sacrifice to save us. Obedience to his requirement for us to believe in Him is the only way to be spared from the Wrath of God that will be poured out on everyone who rejects Him. The freedom bell may be in a museum in Philly, but Noah's crazy beliefs still ring loudly for anyone who will hear. Thank you America for not silencing that beautiful hymn!","Off Trail

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543557,"If yesterday was all sunshine in Philadelphia, then today was anything but in New Jersey. Afternoon thunder showers were the theme. We had decided to end our approx 2 week string of free or nearly free hotel stays tonight with a return to camping. It was truly an upside down world. Private campgrounds cost $45/ night in many places and we never paid over $50 for a hotel. It was reminiscent of that time in college in 2005 when a 24 pack of beer was cheaper then a gallon of gas... 
We were welcomed back to the woods with a powerful display of Gods power. The worst of it was around 5pm, when it got nearly as dark as night and a fog rolled in. Winds chased the fog away with an impressive lightning display. Apparently, there were tornado warnings in the area. The scary part about being caught on the trail in those conditions is lightning while on exposed ridge lines and falling branches. During the worst of it, Sherpa caught up with Raiden, who was trying to find a nearby shelter. They walked together for about half an hour until it died down enough to pull up our location on a phone. The shelter was 1.5 miles behind us. Dismayed, Raiden turned back and retraced his steps, while Sherpa pushed on 2 miles to the shelter of Porters car. 
Porter had made arrangements at a nearby campground run by a witty old man, but the rain came before she could put up the tent. Porter overheard a conversation he was having with another guest that went something like this: guest ""I locked my keys in my car"" owner ""I'll send someone with a rock to take care of that for you right away."" Once reunited, we found refuge in a nearby Mexican restaurant until the storm passed and then setup camp for the night.","AMC Mohican Outdoor Center-Camp Road - 1303.5

So far we have been to North Carolina, Texas, Georgia, Tennessee, and Virginia. Doing state high points together is a great way to add an outdoor element to family vacations and keep you from visiting the same places over and over again. We hope someday to see all of them but Alaska. There is even a nickname for people like us who are trying to summit a collection of mountains, we are called ""peak baggers"". New Jerseys was extra easy because it was right along the trail. It is on a mount aptly named ""high point peak"", and with only 1803 feet of elevation, close proximity to major population centers, and a location in a state park sporting a parking lot at the top, this one is very accessible. There is a fancy obelisk marking the location which has fallen into a state of disrepair and is now barricaded off for safety reasons.","US 206 - Culver's Gap 1321.4

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543959,"We continued our journey today, starting in New Jersey and finishing in New York. New Jersey has been beautiful. It really exceeded our expectations. We assumed it would have an urban feel due to its proximity to major population centers. On the contrary, the views are either of the woods or farmland. There are occasional delis at road crossings but at no time did we feel like we were walking through a city. The trail passed through a nice wildlife refuge before leaving the state and followed a beautiful boardwalk that was about a half mile long thru a marshland complete with a suspension bridge. The exit from New Jersey matched its splendid welcome at the Delware Water Gap with an equally beautiful send off. Perhaps the only disappointment we had (and this is really minor) is that New Jersey had a reputation for having the most bears of any place along the trail. The only indirect evidence we saw was a bumper sticker on someone's car that had a heart, a black bear, and the state initials. Well, we heard something going through the dumpster at our campground too but that could have been hikers based on our experience in hot springs? Just kidding. Seriously though, there was ""bearily"" any evidence of bear activity. We expected to see lots of scree on the trail at least but only saw it once. One hiker we chatted with did see one bear eating blueberries, so they aren't mythical beings.
Early indications are promising that New York's beauty may surpass New Jerseys. The state opens with a forest of mixed deciduous and conifer trees. The terrain then traverses miles of lichen covered slabs of rock overlooking beautiful lakes. It has a distinctly Northern feel that's hard to explain. And familiar faces seem to abound here. Porter saw Mermaid and treehugger at a crossing just before the state line, and Sherpa saw crockamole just past the boundary. As a side note, crockamole is now sporting a hiking kilt, the only somewhat socially acceptable man skirt on the market in 2016.
 So this part of the Appalachian Trail is known as the deli hike. Supposedly, you can time the road crossings to grab a meal each day without too much difficulty. This of course would be welcome relief if we were subsisting on dehydrated backpacking meals. Since we have the benefit of a car, our trusted cooler ""Seewald the 2nd"", a fancy Coleman stove, and uninterrupted access to grocery stores and restaurants, the novelty of a better than subway sandwhich is probably lost on us. We did stop in at a nice one for lunch today to honor the tradition. In addition to a fine array of deli fare, they had delicious homemade donuts. But instead of supporting another deli this evening, we intended to show solidarity with our hiker brethren by instead heating up some dehydrated fare. Nevertheless, convenience won out and all the good intentions in the world couldn't stop us from picking up some yummy New York style pizza by the slice!","Lott Road - 1,344.5

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543960,"This morning we packed up all of our camping gear from the harmony ridge campground and picked up our hike in New York. The trail through New York is indescribably beautiful. Frequently passing by quiet lakes, weaving through healthy forests of towering trees that are not too crowded to block views of large mossy rocks and grassy undergrowth. Wild blueberries abound. Spectacular. The trail passed through the ""lemon squeezer"", a narrow corridor of tall rocks that forces most hikers to remove their packs. There was even a fatman bypass, with the politically correct label ""easy way"". Sherpa didn't have either of those problems and quickly navigated the obstacle. The trail has become significantly more fun with each passing day. Despite the lack of elevation, the builders have found ways to make challenging what otherwise could have been mundane. Not a day goes by now where you don't have to at some point stop, regroup, figure out how to approach a particular feature, and then use your hands to safely pass on. 
While waiting at a crossing for Sherpa, Porter overheard two hikers (big bird and furioso) say ""There's that car again."" They were referring to her of course. A little later, Sherpa explained the situation to them, how we switched to a supported hike when she was injured. He saw crockamole, who was hiking the wrong way, just like the first time we met him. This time he had an excuse, he had dropped something. 
Sherpa chatted with several other hikers through the day, including a 21 year old hiker named cautious. Cautious was sarcastically named for his recklessness. He is hiking the trail to be ""care free, with no boss, no homework."" He also has no education and discouraging job prospects awaiting him when he finishes. We chatted a little about different hikers we both knew. He gave a profoundly sad response when Sherpa mentioned one guy, ""oh that's his name? I've drank at bars with him, smoked weed with him, but never knew his name."" It was a good reminder of how empty and lonely the partying lifestyle is. A high school friend of Sherpa's fell into that scene in college. After a couple semesters of it, that friend made a rather disturbing realization about the lifestyle, ""I accidentally washed my phone with my clothes and lost all of my contacts. All those people I thought were my friends never even called me. What a waste."" The bible says it best ""He who walks with wise men will be wise, but a companion of fools suffers harm."" Proverbs 13:20. To aquire wisdom, all you have to do is turn to Proverbs in the bible. It is full of easy to understand advice such as staying away from drunkards, not engaging in sex outside your marriage, the importance of a good reputation, the problems with a lying tongue, etc. Praying that as cautious gets older, he will find good influences and gain wisdom so that someday he lives up to his name rather than mocking it.
 Our hiking was cut short by a storm that rolled through, making the rocks slippery and unsafe to traverse quickly. Thankfully, as the rain poured down, we had a place to stay indoors. Tonight we stayed with friends from Texas. We have been looking forward to seeing them because they moved out here for work a few years ago and their visits to Texas are infrequent. After visiting awhile, we said goodnight, retired to a guest bedroom, and watched Hillary Climton accept her parties nomination for the presidency of the United States. Regardless of of ones political convictions, it was a proud moment for a country which prides itself on equality to nominate its first potential female president, in sharp contrast to many places in the world where women can't even drive or show their face in public.","NY 17 A-1,371.3

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543962,"Today's highlights were walking on a bridge across the Hudson River and finishing early to cleanup before dinner to celebrate our 5 monthiversary. We know that there is much anticipation around our monthly romantic dinner plans, especially after we celebrated 4 months at McDonalds. For those of you betting on Taco Bell, we had that for lunch yesterday, so it really wasn't an option. And now that we are in New York, which is famous for its own pizza, there are not many Little Ceasars nearby. We ended up going on a double date with friends to a fancy smancy old world style Spanish reastaurant for a 37 course candle lit meal (ok maybe 17?)... We know, we know- we have only been married 5 months and we are already losing our romance. Wendys for six months babe! We will reignite the flames of love!
On a much lower note, we hit bottom on the trail today, figuratively speaking. The trail dips to 124 feet above see level near the bridge across the Hudson River. Thankfully they didn't route the trail all the way down to the river which is closer to sea level. Another low note was that the trail side zoo was closed by the time Sherpa reached it. Yes, for those of you unfamiliar with this section of the Appalachian Trail, it actually passes right through a zoo. It is quite possibly the only zoo in the world where some of the the guests (hikers) are smellier than the animals. And speaking of wild animals, the lowest note of all was the deer we saw while having lunch at a crossing. When it saw our food, it started drooling worse than a dog trained to beg at the dinner table. Unfortunately, although not surprisingly, several tourists saw that poor deer's predicament and traded treats for photos. Sherpa tried a slightly passive aggressive deterrent to defend the creature. Aware of the attitude of many locals towards guns, he advised ""they taste better when you don't feed them human food..."" It was slightly more effective than just telling them plainly 'if you tame them with treats, it isn't loving, it just makes it easier for the hunters...' 
The story does bring up an interesting topic- is it alright to eat meat? YES. YES. YES. God gave mankind permission to eat animal flesh in the Old Testament (Gen 9), reaffirmed that it was alright in the New Testamemt (Acts 10, 1Cor 8, etc) and then warned us about wicked people who would forbid us from eating meat in the last days (1 Tim 4). So unless you are more righteous than God, eating meat is acceptable, although too much of the wrong kind might give you high cholesterol, and by the way, hunting is an acceptable way to source meat which generally won't overload you with cholesterol, according to some studies.","Arden Valley Road - 1388.8

Up to the challenge, Porter baked a special version of a classic breakfast delight, think French Toast meets monkey bread in buttery Paula Dean fashion. It slowed us down getting onto the trail for sure. Heavy rains in the afternoon also forced us off the trail early. Or maybe the invitation to go out for New York pizza in the evening was just too tempting to pass up. In either case, the shorter day was welcomed by Sherpa, who wrapped up nearly 400 miles of hiking in just 3 weeks. While Sherpa was hiking, Porter went out with the ladies and got her nails done.

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544972,"Yesterday, we took the day off to worship the Lord, rest, and enjoy each other's company. We visited a large beautiful church building with a small elderly congregation. The area we are in is blessed to be very affluent, and cursed to be very secular. It's another example of the classic battle for the heart that has replayed itself in every generation of humans since Adam sinned. Jesus spoke of this struggle in Matthew 6 when he said, ""no one can serve two masters, he will either hate one and love the other, or serve one and despise the other, you cannot serve both God and money."" The great irony is that wealth is sometimes spoken of in scripture as a blessing from God, and it can be, yet it is dangerous because our eyes have this tendency to covet and when their focus becomes anything other than the Lord, our hearts follow our eyes. Solomon was the classic example of this. Spiritually he started off so well as a young man, blessed with the privilege of building a temple for the Lord. He was incredibly blessed by God with material wealth. Eventually his heart drifted from the Lord as a direct result of the blessings. Jesus's words still ring just as true today in New York as they did 2000 years ago where people on fire for the Lord built great places of worship, and then fell away amidst the distraction of material wealth.
On a lighter note, we went to a horseback riding lesson of the daughter of the family we are staying with. She is less than 10 years old and doing jumps under the instruction of a US Olympic team trainer. Supposedly she is a natural or they wouldn't bother giving her a timeslot. Hopefully she sticks with it and does well! For other hobbies, she really enjoys putting hair ties in Sherpa's hair and painting Porters nails. She also taught us to make a slimy playdough like substance out of elders glue and borax. 
Today was a lighter day on the trail, with only about 11 miles. We finished making preparations in the afternoon for a surprise trip to California. Porter has been blessed with the ability to take all of her nieces to Disneyland when they turned 5. So far she made three trips. This has been a really special way that she has been able to invest in their lives and show them love. A fourth one was turning 5 this week and the family decided to do a vacation together since we were on the trail and weren't in a position to take her. But since we have the car, we hiked fast the last few weeks to make up time to be able to take the week off and join them. If any of you wonder what Porter does while waiting for Sherpa to hike, in the last few weeks she made three Disney shirts for the kids of this family. She has also made a first birthday outfit that includes a tutu for another niece. You could say that she is crafty.... We will check back in with you in a week.","Dennytown Road 1,417.7

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545103,"After a fun filled week in Disneyland with Porters mom and younger brother's family, we decided to spend Saturday night in the heart of New York City. We like to hike, so instead of catching the subway, we walked 100 city blocks from where our bus let us off from the airport in Harlem to our hotel. As usual, Sherpa was carrying Porters bag... We were amazed by the crowds of people hunting Pokemon! There was one area people even setup lawn chairs, which sort of defeats the point. We bought dinner at a food cart taking advantage of the Pokemon crowds. While waiting for our food, it became clear that the territory belonged to other carts, who gave ""friendly"" warnings to the food cart to leave. Waking up near downtown on Sunday, we caught the subway to Brooklyn to worship the Lord. We attended the Brooklyn Tabernacle, a large and alive church. This was the first church we have visited on our trip that has a choir! Apparently they have won 6 Grammys. Go big or go home. The pastor hit on the need for Jesus to satisfy our spiritual appetite, teaching from the passage where Jesus tells us, ""I am the bread of life, he who eats of me will never go hungry again."" It was spot on. After service, we had the normal physical food which of course only temporarily satisfies until the next meal time. We enjoyed pizza and garlic knots. Sure wish we had those again today.... After we walked back to Manhatten across the Brooklyn bridge, we made our way back to the trail.Today we resumed the northward adventure with Sherpa hiking and Porter driving. The trail is now strangely empty of thruhikers. We passed a couple, but the majority are hundreds of miles ahead. This must be what it was like hiking here 30 years ago! The weather was slightly cooler today, which made for some really nice hiking. We missed meeting up at one road crossing which turned a 2 mile hike into a 7 mile hike. There was a nice reward on the other side, however. Porter picked up dinner for us at a place called Vinny's Deli which has been featured on the food network.    Yum!

It was sunny, warm, the smell of wild flowers hanging in the air, not too buggy. Perfect for a walk in the woods. So blessed to be here immersed in the work of Gods hands! Beginning at the Appalachian Train station in New York, the hike passed through pasture for about a half mile before entering the woods. A photographer (www.fluentimagery.com/) was staged at a crossing with snacks, drinks, and free pictures. He is working on a photo project of hikers and hopes to get the material picked up by a magazine. Sure hope it is successful. Sherpa paused to chat with a Southbounder named Bright Side, named for his optimistic attitude. He started with his granddaughter, but she bailed on him after surviving the hundred mile wilderness. He is retired and enjoying the hike. He expressed a desire to get his wife out with him. Sherpa explained slackpacking and how it allows us to do the hike together even though we aren't both on the trail.
Not long after getting on, we crossed into Connecticut! This state has a 50 mile section of the trail. Geologists think the rocks here comprise the oldest along the trail because the top layers have eroded away exposing lower layers. Psalm 104:5 says ""He set the earth on its foundations, so that it should never be moved."" and Psalm 89:11 says ""The heavens are yours, the earth is also yours, the world and all that is in it. You have founded them."" How awesome to tread upon the depths of Gods creation?
We met at the 2/3 point of the trail, mile 1459.4 right on schedule with about 2/3 of our total time spent. Wildlife spotted today included a beehive, a deer, a rabbit, a raccoon, and a rattlesnake. We also chatted with Arrowhead and Skydog, a father son team that started about the same time we did. They are in the oil industry in Colorado and are out of work right now because of the low oil prices. They expressed frustration with the stoner culture that is taking over their home state. We sympathized. It went without saying that they hadn't escaped it by hiking the Appalachian Trail.

We woke up feeling great, with ambitions to do a 26 mile day, but by the time we made it to the trail, it was raining raccoons and coyotes. Sherpa set off in his Chacos sandals instead of his running shoes, because he did not want them to get soaked. The sandals are much slower to hike in, however, with the first two miles taking well over an hour. Huge rocks on the steep section of trail required using both arms and legs to descend. These rocks become somewhat slippery when wet, which meant more time was needed to safely navigate them. Porter travelled a scary gravel road that was inundated with water and became a river from the rains. Carrying precious cargo of hot chocolate, she made it safely. Thankfully the rain let up, and in his haste, Sherpa surrendered both his rain poncho and his beloved bug net at the stop. The next 5 miles the gnats swarmed him as the rain subsided. Without bug spray, or the bug net, the only other escape would have been to outrun them. This section was especially flat and would have been easy to jog. Alas, he was still wearing his sandals. An optimist, he thought to himself, at least gnats have protein... as he breathed them in. When God drove out the inhabitants of Canaan to give the land to the Israelites ~3500 years ago, the bible says that one of the things he used to make them flee was hornets. Imagine how effective that would have been, no bug spray, houses that weren't sealed well, etc. We would have left in a hurry! Thankfully these gnats don't sting! After meeting up we did a flip flop and hiked South several miles because we weren't sure if there would be parking at the next crossing. Sherpa grabbed some snacks, his tennies, the bug net, and jumped back on the trail. To his surprise, he passed gasket! Apparently he had taken some time off at Harpers Ferry. Always fun to run into people you have hiked with before. Spirits renewed, he hurried to the next crossing, which thankfully, was mostly downhill. We took off early to fetch Sherpa's mom, who flew into LaGuardia today to spend the weekend with us. We predict more New York style pizza in our future.

After enjoying breakfast at our hotel, Porter got an idea. Let's make egg salad sandwiches for lunch. Among the contents of Seewald the 2nd (our cooler) that had been transferred to our hotel mini fridge were mayo and mustard and the breakfast bar had bread and hardboiled eggs. Delicious innovation. A few minutes later, with sandwiches in hand, we set out along with Sherpa's Momma Mia. There really isn't a convenient rendezvous point near the Connecticut border.   Our choices were finishing 5 miles before or 7 miles after.    Not wanting to do a 12 mile hike in the evening without breaks with a weather system approaching, we opted for finishing at mile 1499. Momma Mia did get out and hike a couple miles. No trailname yet, but she still has 2187 miles to go... It was fun hiking with someone who is not a thruhiker. We carefully selected one of the flattest sections (a fair amount followed a road, the rest paralleled the Housatonic River). Still, the few elevation changes brought forth astonished outbursts of ""You've gotta be kidding me!"". For those of you thinking about hiking the AT, it's not flat and it's not paved. You can't really appreciate the many small ups and downs until you've walked a bit of it. But she also noticed the things that thruhikers get used to, like the smells, the sounds, bark peeling off trees. Once, she started to follow a blue blaze side trail. Her experience was made even more authentic when a southbound hiker asked Sherpa for weed and then saw her come up over a hill and said ""oh, never mind"". After sweating thru a couple miles, she was ready to return to our air conditioned chariot. Back in the car with Porter, they set out to find a bathroom that didn't require using leaves or burying waste. That brought them to the oldest free public library in the United States, located in Salisbury, Ct. Allegedly, some of the books still haven't been colored in.

Sherpa suggested, ""instead of going to the city again, we could keep hiking,"" to which she exclaimed, ""Thank You!"" The city did have one notable highlight. We passed through the ""strawberry fields"" section of Central Park, which had a mosaic that said ""imagine"" for a focal point. A flock of John Lennon devotees, barely distinguishable from most thruhikers, surrounded the spot as if it were a shrine. One of the beatniks called out to Sherpa, ""hey! Beardo! Check out my beard, it's not as good as yours, but it is coming along."" Wow! Such flatterry. Meanwhile, as a nearby hippy played a Beatles hit on his acoustic guitar, Porter was humming along her own lyrics: ""imagine there's no beard, it's easy if you try.

We would have pegged it at ""sticky"", but none of us studied meteorology. The trail summitted bear mountain, which was incorrectly marked as the highest point in Connecticut. The true point is a few miles away on the slope of a mountain that has its peak in Massachussettes. Getting off bear mountain was very challenging, but there was a surprise waiting at the bottom for Sherpa. Momma Mia and Porter had found a way to access the trail which wasn't in our guide. We had a really nice lunch together. From there it was a few more miles over Mt Race and up Mt Everett to finish the day.

It is no secret that we try to visit churches each week where the word of God is honored, in order to worship the Lord and fellowship with fellow believers. It was natural for us to look into visiting the 'First churches of Northampton', which traces its roots back thru his congregation. Sadly, the present church completely rejects the man. They lay out their view of him on their website if interested (firstchurches.org). The problems they have with him are: (1) he was a serious theologian who wrote about topics such as original sin, free will, virtue, etc. ""topics of no great urgency for mainline churches today"".  (2) his write famous sermons on hell such as sinners in the hands of an angry God ""led to two centuries of fundamentalist revivals. It's a tough legacy to embrace."" Excuse me, but how can you call yourself a Christian and complain that someone's work led to hundreds of years of people coming to know the Lord? (3) ""he was bible centered in his thinking and preaching to a degree that's alien in our unbiblical age"". Yes, believing and teaching the bible is an actual complaint these imposters have against him. (4) he believed in original sin and ""salvation through atonement and faith to a degree that seems at least non-ecumenical, even intolerant."" For example, he hated catholic teachings of grace through good works instead of faith.These are not problems! Jonathan Edwards church is exactly the church we want to go to! It's almost comical reading, as they go on to try to defend him by comparing him in one place to a feminist and in another place loosely to some sort of pioneer environmentalist.The second lesson comes from the end of his ministry, in 1750, after he confronted sin within his church. He was the pastor of a Congregational church that had democratic bylaws. Instead of repenting when confronted, the church members voted him out of the pulpit! What a chilling reminder of the greatest flaw in representative forms of government- voting gives an equal voice to both the righteous and the wicked. Many of the founding fathers recognized this danger in their writings. John Adams for example went as far as to say ""Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."" While contemplating what happened to Jonathan Edwards, and the current state of the church in Northampton that is reluctantly tied to his legacy, an AP article today titled ""Obama urges democrats to campaign aggressively for Clinton"" caught our attention. It was essentially a call from a prominent leader to his followers to use their time, energy, and resources to fight for their beliefs in the face of a threat, which in this case was Donald Trump. It was strangely reminiscent of a similar call to Christians to ""earnestly contend for the faith"" that went out almost 2000 years ago from a man named Jude, thought to be the half brother of Jesus. In Jude's letter to all Christians everywhere, he mentions that he started to write about our common salvation, but God instead directed him to write a very different letter. Instead of a good vibes, Joel Osteen style letter of encouragement, he instead painted a picture of the church under attack from wicked men that had attained leadership positions within the church and urged all the Christians to earnestly contend against these men for the true faith. He points out that our faith was delivered once, implying that anyone who tries to change the message subsequently is a false teacher. He then gives all Christians with a bible information so that they can identify the false teachers, by focusing on two aspects of their false ministry. 1) The false teachers pervert the gospel by telling people it is alright to sin sexually. * He illustrates his point when he says that they follow Baalam's error. Baalam was prophet in the Old Testament that for a price taught Israel's enemies to introduce sexual immorality to Israel which brought God's wrath on them. In essence, they teach what people will pay to hear rather than respecting Gods word and they encourage sexual immorality.* He uses Sodom and Gommorrah as an example to show that God punishes the type of sexual immorality being encouraged by these wicked men with eternal fire. Sodom and Gommorrah were destroyed by fire after God sent to angels disguised as men into the city and the men of the city came out to have homosexual relations with them. Jude carefully points out that it was the unnatural sexual appetites specifically that were being punished.* This false teaching is sadly present in Jonathan Edwards church today, where sexual immorality such as homosexuality is embraced. Aside from their departure from scripture and their discomfort with teaching salvation according to the bible, they are also recognized as a gay friendly church and affirm the behavior, taking part in pride events, etc.2) The false teachers deny that salvation is through faith in Jesus. * Jude illustrates this point as well when he states that false teachers walk the way of Cain. Cain tried to approach God his own way, even though God desired a blood sacrifice, which pointed to Jesus's death. The idea is that false teachers try to approach God differently than he wants to be approached, aka man made religion.* He also cites a time God punished people for not approaching him the way he desired, by calling as a witness a man named Korah, a Levite who led a rebellion against Moses, arguing that anyone could approach God, not just the priests. He ended up perishing along with many followers when the ground opened up and swallowed him.* This false teaching is also embraced in Jonathan Edwards church today, where salvation by faith is ""intolerant"" and they openly admit that bible centered thinking is foreign.Jude then gives us examples to remind us of times when a few wicked leaders led many righteous astray:* His first example is when twelve Jewish leaders were sent as spies into the land of Canaan before the Jews entered the land of Israel. 10 of them convinced the whole nation that they shouldn't go because of the mighty nations already living there. God said have it your way and the entire congregation of 2-3 million Jews died in the wilderness over the next 40 years of wandering.* He also seems to be calling to mind the Angels that followed Satan, a prominent angel, in his rebellion against God.   As a result, a third of the angelic beings were led astray in this manner.Jude even gives instructions on how to approach false teachers and their followers. We are not to level reviling accusations against the leaders but instead let Gods word rebuke them. For those who are caught up in their teachings, there is no one size fits all approach. Some just need to be gently corrected with mercy, others need to be snatched away. If you find yourself in a church like the one in Northampton, MA that Jonathan Edwards taught at long ago that now openly broadcasts a low view of scripture on their website, where salvation is not exclusively by faith in Jesus, where sexual immorality is embraced, Jude's message is clear. Earnestly contend for the faith! His call is for the everyday Christians, bibles in hand, to show these corrupt leaders what they are, false teachers, and drive them out. In closing, George Washington once said that ""Experience teaches us that it is much easier to prevent an enemy from posting themselves than it is to dislodge them after they have got possession.""","MA, Guilder Pond Picnic Area- 1512.2

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546221,"Massachusetts starts in the south at beautiful Mt. Everett (2,602 ft elevation). The trail then has a long and relatively flat area which connects to Mt Graylock (3491 ft) in the Northern part of the state. That will be the first time that the trail has exceeded 3000 ft elevation since North Marshall Mountain in Virginia over 625 miles earlier! We find ourselves today in the flatish middle section between these two mountains.   Taking advantage of the slightly easier terrain, we are trying to push bigger miles while we can. Yesterday we did about 26 miles and today we pushed out another 25. The weather cooperated with clouds, light rain and pleasant temperatures in the 70s. This was noteworthy following a weekend heatwave across much of the northeast which left several dead in Philadelphia and necessitated cooling centers in New York City. The trail was pretty, leading to ponds, lakes, hills not quite big enough to be mountains, and similar idyllic settings with moss covered rocks and scattered Christmas trees. A few hikers were out, but none that we recognized. Since the hike was long and largely uneventful, Sherpa decided to liven things up by finishing the day with a race. Our final meeting place was 3.1 miles after the previous road crossing. Sherpa ran the whole way, pretending like it was a 5k. We won't discuss his time, but the prize of course was spending extra time with Porter tonight. In case you are wondering, he was the winner (ok he was the only competitor).We are staying in a section of Massachusetts right now called ""the Berkshires."" It is a popular vacation spot made up of a group of small towns in Western MA that all seem to have quaint main streets dotted with restaurants and shops amidst a pastoral countryside backdrop. We picked up the local paper to get a sense of the place and were surprised to learn that they have a theater scene. They also seem to attract the yoga retreat crowd. One section of the paper stood in stark contrast to all of the entertainment options, the support group section. We counted and there were 48 support different groups listed.   Topics included LGBTQ issues, domestic violence, managing addictions (i.e. Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, gamblers anonymous, recovery international, etc.), finding healing after suicide loss, and coping with health problems ranging from autoimmune diseases to cancer. There was even an Ostomy support group ""for all men and women who have had an Ostomy.""   The many manifestations of brokenness and hurting on display in this small community are a heartbreaking reminder of the pain and suffering creation has been enduring since death entered the world through Adam's sin! With the open recognition that this affluent area is plagued with so many problems, we thought surely there would be some space allocated to the life giving hope found in Jesus Christ. Jesus famously declared that ""I have come that they may have life, and have it abundantly."" (John 10:10). Searching the whole newspaper carefully, we only found one scant mention of a faith based program. The silence towards religion was deafening!   Despite the lack of recognition by the local newspaper, we have been pleasantly encouraged, seeing evidence that God is very much alive and working in this community. For example, there were flyers from multiple local churches hosting community activities posted on the AT info boards. The free library box had donated Christian books. We even saw a group praying on the lawn of their church. So grateful for the many faithful Christians here who are helping the broken world find healing, even if the newspaper doesn't recognize their efforts. We have been so blessed to meet so many people who love Jesus along the way and it is great seeing their presence here as well.","MA, Fernside rd, 1537.9

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546292,"As we continue our big push northward, we summitted the peak of Mt Greylock in Northern Massachussettes today. This was the highest point in the state, and had convenient road access. Another peak in the bag for us. There was also an observation tower that was closed for renovations. The journey had its ups and downs, both literally and figuratively. Really there was only one down, today, which came the moment Sherpa realized that he left one of his two sets of hiking underwear and a pair of hiking socks at the hotel we stayed at last night. After a frantic call, he learned that they had thrown them away already. So now you know, Sherpa does (did) wear underwear, unlike many hikers! The rest of the day was great.Early in the day, Porter parked next to a van belonging to one of the Appalachian Mountain Clubs that maintains this section of trail. Sherpa passed the group on his way to the crossing. There were several teenagers under the supervision of an adult moving a large Boulder with the help of some lever tools. What a great activity for young adults. Around the same time, Sherpa met Thor and Rocket. Sherpa had been leapfrogging with them the last couple days. As often happens when slack packing, they began to recognize Sherpa after a seeing him a few days in a row. Upon realizing that he isn't just a day hiker, they called out ""What's your name?"" We walked together awhile and chatted. It turns out that they got a late start on the trail because they both graduated college in May. They each started on June 1st and have been doing high mile days (often 30+) to reach Katadyn before the snow. They did not know each other before hiking, but both set out with a common purpose and met on Springer mountain in Georgia. They are now hiking the whole trail together, pushing each other on to harder and longer days. The bible says that ""As iron sharpens iron, so too does one man sharpen another."" What a great illustration of the principal with each encouraging the other to push ahead at a grueling pace.The trail passed through the residential area of a small town called Dalton. It was here that a grandmother was sitting on her front porch, supervising 3 young entrepreneurs as they sold lemonade. They tried to sell one to Sherpa, but he wasn't carrying any money. They still insisted he drink one and visit with them. Such a nice family. Sherpa told them how it reminded him how of Jesus commended people who offered just a cup of cold water to his followers in his name. The grandma was quick to add ""and I believe that!"" Porter later ran back in the car and gave them the reward of their labor, a couple crispy George Washingtons.The trail also passed through the sleepy town of Cheshire before ascending the 3491 foot summit of Mt Greylock. The ascent was the highlight of the hike! The beauty of the views at the peak, and the fragile ecosystem surrounding the trail has not been surpassed since Grayson highlands in Virginia. A splendid foretaste of the beauty that lies ahead in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.","MA, Blotz Rd, 1562.3

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546383,"Heading down the slopes of Mt Greylock, we now set our sites on Vermont and the 1600 mile mark. A few minutes off the top, Sherpa met a SOBO (southbound hiker) named ""powderpuff"". He is planning to do the Connecticut challenge, which involves hiking thru the entire state in one day. Good luck buddy! Should be doable. Shortly after saying goodbye, Sherpa passed an unnussual sign. It forbid all motorized vehicles along the trail, which is typical, but then welcomed cross country skiers. Guess we are getting pretty far Notth. If we start seeing snow shoeing signs, we will know we made a wrong turn and and went to Canada by mistake... After reaching Williamstown, which is at the base of the mountain, we drove together to scout out the next crossing, s dirt road called ""county road."".   As feared, it was sketchy and we chose not to risk driving up it in our Corolla. Sadly, this didn't leave us with quite enough day light to hike to the next real road crossing, 19 miles away. Instead, we called it a day early. Vermont and 1600 will have to wait until tomorrow.Thankful we did stop because at dusk an impressive storm rolled in that will undoubtably leave the trails muddy for days to come.","MA, Bascom Lodge, 1585.9

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546546,"This morning we woke up, grabbed a half price breakfast at Friendlys, and hit the section without crossings that we ran out of time to do yesterday. At the drop off spot, there were a couple of hikers that needed a ride back into town. Porter happily picked them up. One was from Germany and is returning home in December on a flight from Miami. They started about a month ago and are already a quarter of the way through. Even with the fast pace, the finish line will probably be chilly. Hopefully they dont wake up any hibernating bears when they pass thru the Smokies! Today's highlights included reaching Vermont and passing the 1600 mile mark. Vermont is state number 12 of 14. Beginning here, the Appalachian Trail joins the Southern terminus of another trail called ""the long trail"", after which the two trails coincide for about 100 miles before ours turns East towards New Hampshire and the long trail instead continues northward to Canada, showcasing the beauty of Northern Vermont. It is a popular but difficult several hundred mile hike.Sherpa saw Thor and rocket again. They are the two guys who started on June 1st, but have jet packs or something because they are flying. Last time he saw them, they had an unlucky college friend with them. The poor guy couldn't keep up and quit after 2 days. He had to call a cab from the top of mt Greylock. This time they had an older guy named School Bag with them. He was another friend of theirs. Wonder if they will burn him out too? Sherpa also saw Texas Hippy on the trail. Last saw him in Pennsylvania. Detour and off center were hiking together, another pair he sees now and then. He also passed Prov. She mentioned that she is looking forward to staying at a hotel Saturday, drinking some beer, and watching the men's marathon event from the olympics Sunday morning. Someone who signed our guestbook later commented to us that one of the reasons young people aren't in church is that our culture has become so focused on sports. Maybe they are onto something? Regardless, she was very excited to show Sherpa that she had switched back to her old pair of shoes, the same trusty la sportiva wildcats that have led to almost 900 blister free miles for Sherpa! Still can't thank her enough for the recommendation to switch to them.","MA, Phelps Rd, 1591.8

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546575,"We started the day at a fantastic diner in Bennington Vermont called ""Sonnys Blue Benn Diner"", which was supposedly one of the top 21 diners in the US according to a newspaper article proudly displayed in the former passenger train car converted into dining room. They even had real Vermont maple syrup to make it just a little more special. Thankfully we beat the crowds and didn't have to wait to be served. In the parking lot of Sherpa's dropoff location along VT 9, we met two day hikers who shared with us that today is ""Appalachian Trail Day""! Apparently Backpacker Magazine sponsors the holiday and tries to get people to signup to hike every section of the trail. They had signed up to do a few miles South of VT 9 in the direction of Massachussetees, and were planning to drive one of their cars up what would have been an impassible road, but after showing them pictures of the road condition that Sherpa had taken from the trail yesterday, they altered their plans slightly.After a kiss goodbye, we went our separate ways for the day. Today the trail went 22 miles without a road crossing. So nice to be remote, but so hard to say goodbye. Thankfully, we won't have to much longer. We are hoping to ditch our car towards the end of next week and start living out of our packs together again! In preparation, Porter went to scout out some supplies from local outfitters as Sherpa continued to move us North. For the most part, the Green Mountains of Vermont are gentle lumbering giants with gradual ascents and descents largely free of switchbacks. For example, the first half of the day was a mostly uphill section spread out over 10 miles that started below 1500ft elevation and finished above 3700ft on Gastenbury Mt. The subsequent 12 miles were a mostly gentle descent back to about 2000 ft. Armed with his super awesome fanny pack, Sherpa was up for the challenge. The trail was muddy, the weather humid but bearable, and the air heavy with odors, most of which were pleasant.On one occasion early on, a rock that Sherpa placed his foot on sank into the mud, along with his whole shoe, under his full body weight. He was reminded that Christ is not like that stone that gave way. He is a solid rock that you can place everything on and you will never sink into the mud! Apparently this is a common problem on this part of the trail- Texas Hippy shared that he did it twice today! Btw, By the end of Sherpa's hike, both feet matched!Cruzer and Texas Hippy were hiking together today. We stopped and chatted at the base of the fire tower atop Gastenbury mountain. Cruzer is the hiker that we met back in hot springs with ""old timer"" and ""dozer"". Dozer was injured back then but finished Shenandoah before giving up. Old Timer is still plugging along, about 100 miles ahead. And Cruzer, the third musketeer, has to go back to work next week. Game over. So much can happen in 6 months, injuries, money, family, etc.   But hey, if it were easy to do, it probably wouldn't be worth attempting. At the end of the day, our fears were realized. We had made a wrong turn and found ourselves in Canada somehow. You see, there was a sign for Stratton Mt. that welcomed snow shoers! After careful review of our GPS, we determined that we were still in the US. Guess that's a hobby here too? Happy Appalachian Trail Day! Hope you had time to take a hike (or maybe go snow shoeing).","VT, Vt 9, 1610.6

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546699,"The world is going crazy! Last Sunday we didn't make it to church or hike. Today, we did both! Since we basically took Wednesday off, only doing 6 miles, we wanted to make up some miles today to stay on our schedule. Yes, there is actually a method to our madness. So we decided to hike today instead of just resting and enjoying time with each other.   And if you recall, last week we missed church because the service time had changed and it was too late to find another church. Today almost met a similar fate. Google maps graciously led us to the top of a hill.    There was no sign whatsoever of the 182 year old Londonderry Vt First Baptist church that should have been standing there, however. After quickly consulting their website, we learned that the church burned down 6 years ago. Hey 176 years ain't bad. Their ""temporary"" location was at a community center nearby. We quickly plugged the new address into our GPS and braced ourselves for arriving a few minutes late. It's always a little awkward going to small churches where everyone knows you are a visitor. Sneaking in late doesn't help. Arriving to the new address about 5 after, we found directions to a nearby park where they were actually meeting today. Oy! This was starting to feel like some kind of holy scavenger hunt. Determined to find the church, we set off down some back roads and onto a dirt road that provided access to a local swimming hole. At 10 minutes after, we walker down a hill and found a wonderful congregation worshipping the Lord outdoors in the splendor of creation. They were seated in a semi circle around a floating diving platform equipped with a makeshift pulpit and two guitars. Sadly, there was no swimming choir behind the pastor... Our fears of having to sneak into a small church late and sit in the front row were replaced with fears that we would instead have to stand- most people brought their own chairs. To our relief, there was a pair of unoccupied Adirondack chairs off to the side. Forget pews! These are a serious improvement. We took our seats and watched in awe as the pastor waved his hands as he spoke, secretly hoping he would walk on the water. We settled for watching a hawk swoop down and buzz him during a song of worship. We were delighted to learn that he has a degree in meteorology, which explained the hand motions. He confessed that half of the times they met outdoors, it had rained. Even if his scheduling accuracy was about par for a weatherman, he made a great pastor! He spoke about Jesus's compassion on the lost of this world, and how Jesus offered solutions rather than just identifying problems, using his miracle of feeding the 5000 as a text. So true! With so much brokenness all around, it's easy to become jaded and not show compassion.   After service, we visited with them for awhile. The congregation was made up of some of the kindest, Jesus loving people we have met on the trail so far. And those baptists sure know how to cook! Lots of snacks made for a nice time of fellowship after the formal service. We started out this morning looking for a building. Instead, out of the ashes of one, we found a living church!We then headed back to the crossing we finished at yesterday to knock out an 18 mile section without any good access roads in between. It worked out well because Porter needed to tie up some planning for a little trip we will be taking after summitting Katadyn which will conclude our epic honeymoon adventure with a bang. More on that later. As he hiked, Sherpa ran into Thor, School Bag, and Rocket again. They were happy to announce that School Bag was far from burned out, having put in an 18 miler, 14 miler, and another long one today! Good luck School Bag! The trail climbed up mt Stratton, a 3900+ foot peak complete with a gondola and skiing opportunities. After descending the slope (by foot of course), the trail passed a nice pond and a scenic overlook called prospect rock. A weather system was moving in so Sherpa didn't linger long at any of those places, instead pushing ahead quickly to the end. Somewhere along the way, he passed an unmarked spot, officially mile 1641.8, which is the 3/4 point of the hole trail!","VT, Kelly Stand Rd, 1633.2

We added a bag this morning to supplement the remaining ice before heading out but what a success! Thank you yeti! Such an improvement over our old cooler.The weather was cooler today after some showers last night. It was in the 60s and mostly sunny, and felt great to be outside. The trail is decidedly prettier today, passing over peaks with nice views and numerous ponds.   The day was largely uneventful. We didn't see any hikers that we know. Given yesterday's sermon about showing compassion, we were on the lookout for opportunities. One presented itself early on when Sherpa found a lonely shoe laying on the trail. It looked like it had recently fallen off someone's pack and wasnt something a thruhiker would carry. No one he had passed going the other way was a good candidate for owning it, so he decided to pick it up and carry it. A quarter mile later, he came up behind a group of middle aged, section hiking women making there way north singing ""buttercup don't break my heart."" They were quite surprised when they heard him join the last chorus from behind them and burst into giggling. The lady in the rear was the rightful owner of the shoe and declared him to be her Prince Charming. He thanked them for the sentiment, but is of course he is Porters Prince Charming already.Sherpa may still be charming, but he is not nearly as prince like as he was on February 29, the day we got married. They warn you that hikers get a condition known as ""t-Rex arms"" in which the body accesses stored energy (i.e. Fat) and much needed protein from all over the body in a desperate attempt to keep the legs fueled for all the hiking. Basically you end up with scrawny arms... Sherpa is now officially afflicted with this condition, a realization he came to when he went to put his adjustable sports armband. It is now loose even at its tightest setting. If it is any consolation, the studly newlywed arms have given way to a stately honeymoon beard, and he held her with his wimpy arms, and they hiked happily ever after.

In less than 2 months, we will be back at work. Speaking of the arms, the T Rex arms we mentioned yesterday are gone! After noticing then, Sherpa realized he was dehydrated and drank several liters of water. The sports armband had no problems staying on today. The trail started off today fairly unremarkable, crossing a series of small hills and roads for about 12 miles. It really struggled to compare with yesterday's beauty. The last 11 miles more than compensated for the beauty lacking in the earlier miles. The trail climbed over Killington peak, the second tallest mountain in Vermont. We haven't tasted 4000 feet elevation for a long time and the Northern latitude made it especially pretty.

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547094,"We checked out of our hotel in Rutland, VT this morning. This is the city that made national news a few months ago for wanting to have a vote on whether to host Syrian refugees. At the time, the mainstream media defended the town, characterizing the local attitudes as primarily being disgusted that some in their community wouldn't want to help. The local papers today continued that theme, mentioning efforts to help collect cold weather gear in case they come. It will certainly be a shock for the refugees if they are given the green light. And not just the weather. We took our chariot in to have the brakes looked at and Porter chatted with a local who was sincerely worried about the refugees blowing up the local home depot. To make matters worse, he shared that the community has a large contingent of Hasidic Jews. As if to prove his point, a Jewish family walked in with the edges of their hair uncut, wearing robes, and speaking Hebrew to each other. The guy at the auto shop went on to discuss the problems the refugees have caused in other places they have settled, citing crimes ranging from petty theft, to rapes, to suicide bombings. All that on top of a city already plagued by a heroin epidemic that he also complained about. Sounds pretty scary if you take it at face value. The main stream media of course is seeking to marginalize these voices in the public dialogue using their familiar tactic of adding ""-phobia"" to a certain word, in this case Islam, with the assumption that anyone labeled as such is ignorant and their opinion shouldn't matter. And despite the media's attempts to quiet fears, there are a range of less than welcoming views that persist throughout the Western world which we won't go into.    Clearly, not everyone feels this way though! Should we just throw these people away? Could 100 refugees from a war torn country in a town of over 10,000 possibly cause that much harm? Aside from a new Mediterranean restaurant, hookah lounge, and maybe a Mosque, what is the worst thing that could come of this small experiment in multiculturalism?   Perhaps it is a little ironic that a town addicted to Heroin helps with the refugee problem, after all, the heroin trade is believed to be one of ISIS's primary sources of funding... For Christians, though, what should our response be? Just a thought to consider- maybe it is God, not Obama, that is bringing them here, so they can hear about Jesus! Proverbs 21:1 says ""The king’s heart is a stream of water in the hand of the LORD; he turns it wherever he will."" God certainly directs the hearts of rulers. Furthermore, Acts 17:26-27 says that God determines the allotments and boundaries of people so that they can seek him. Couldn't the Lord be behind this dispersion?    America will send her troops to Afghanistan and Iraq, but her churches are reluctant to send their troops, the missionaries so desperately needed to bring hope. But these precious Syrians, after they receive the gospel, will march back to the Arab world carrying the cross on their backs that we have not carried there.Think this is madness? Iran, by some estimates, is home to the fastest growing Christian church in the world! Sherpa has personally attended a fellowship of Iranian Christians. Many have come to the US for various reasons, such as work in the oil industry. What this group had in common was that they had all met the Lord here. And they are busy about sharing Christs love amidst persecution back home. Syrians in the same way need to come to the West to be saved so that they can return with the gospel and bring spiritual water to their dry land! Christians, welcome them! Sign up to be language partners. Help them move furniture. Give them rides. Love them. And tell them about Jesus's love for them. Some will listen.   What is at stake isn't diversity, safety, or preservation of an American identity- our citizenship is in heaven after all- or even the local Home Depot. What's really at stake are lost souls. Yes there may be crime, yes they might even blow up a beloved Home Depot, but in the process some will come to know the Lord. And some of those that do will bring that hope back with them into Syria. Hopelessly sidetracked! In trail lingo, we just took a blue blaze! Getting back on topic, the Appalachian Trail took a big right turn today, splitting off from the Long trail which continues North. The Appalachian Trail, instead, heads East over to the White Mountains of New Hampshire and on into Maine.   The trail continues to get more remote, which makes for very peaceful hiking. Blackberry bushes have plenty of unpicked fruit here, which Sherpa is happy to help himself to. Unfortunately, fewer road crossings also means fewer breaks for Sherpa with Porter. One of our planned road crossings today was hopelessly impassable. This meant that instead of walking 4 miles to his next break, Sherpa walked almost 15. The blackberries sustained him! The trail finished in a pasture today full of cows munching on grass. In addition to hiking a small portion of the AT, and meeting lots of interesting people, these happy cows also get to eat apples falling from wild trees near their pasture. Driving away, we saw a porcupine making his way over to the field with the happy cows. And while we are on the topic of cows, to end our day, we sat down for dinner in the breakfast room of our hotel, and immediately were ""mooved"" to laughter when we saw the view out the window. A truck had pulled in with 13 large white unpainted fiberglass cows en route to a nearby amusement park. The driver told us the park was planning to install mechanical devices so guests could milk the molded monstrosities. It sounded like ""udder"" nonsense to us...","VT, US4, 1700.8

Fortunately for our readers, we had to take the car back in today to have the water pump replaced, which allowed for more interesting conversations with locals. Today, Porter discovered the cheap, organic, easy solution to the Zika virus! A local man from nearby Bethel, Vt built his house with mosquito repelling features. His house actually has built in bat houses and he has not ever had mosquito problems in an otherwise buggy rural area.   Sadly, his bats all died recently due to a white nose bat disease. Determined to continue the fight, he stocked his nearby pond with trout to eat the larvae to help stop breeding.   Bat houses are cheap to buy and easy to build. Experts are divided on the bat diet which includes moths and other insects, but it seems that they at least eat some mosquitos. Maybe Florida and California will try this batty idea out as part of their war on Zika! While at a crossing for a break, we met a flip flopper today named Casper who has about 700 miles left. We think we met him before, he looked familiar. He was hiking with another Southbounder named otter, a biologist from Canada. Otter was taking his time because he enjoyed observing the science in nature. The highlight was making it to New Hampshire today. The other was finding the first wild raspberries on the trail. So far, we have tried blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, red colored blackberries, and wild apples. We probably walk by other edible food daily but just can't identify it.The trail here passes right thru Dartmouth college in Hanover. Lots of students were around, so school must be starting up for them. It was a very nice college wh town. We were curious and looked up how much it would cost to attend. Tuition was 25k per semester, but with housing and other expenses, it cost 70k every year. So for just under 300k, you could get an undergraduate degree! If you are really thrifty, maybe you can save $45 each day for 18 years and then go there debt free. Or you can just be independently wealthy. In either case, the city was beautiful! Sherpa chomped the football stadium as he walked by. Go gators! We enjoyed a dinner at a local Nepalese restaurant and had something really delicious called momo's, which are similar to dumplings you might find at a Chinese restaurant. They are worth trying if you ever find yourself around Nepal or its cuisine.","VT, Vt. 12, 1724.5

Thankfully, our tent stayed nice and dry in the trunk of our car as we continued our journey in hotels. The sun came out and it was a beautiful day for hiking. We knocked out a shorter chunk of the trail because road crossings left us with the choice of either a 19 mile day or a 30+ mile day through the Green Mountains, which aren't exactly a piece of cake. We took our time getting on the trail, allowing the rain to die down. The trail leaving Hanover is reasonably flat, which made for an easy day. Porter met at the approx halfway point with some homemade egg salad pitas for lunch. Yum! The most significant moment of the day came around mile 1760, exactly 1000 miles from the time Sherpa found his beloved trail running shoes. The tread is basically gone now, but they seem to have held up remarkably well. We ordered a second pair for the home stretch and they should be arriving in a few days. Local outfitters, please start carrying the La Sportiva Wildcats. Hikers love them. Just yesterday we met a hiker who was complaining that he couldn't get them at the outfitters and had to switch to a different shoe when his wore out. This is a familiar story among hikers. We basically checked every outfitter in Vermont and many in other states near the AT before resorting to buying them online. Thanks walkabout outfitter in Daleville Va for carrying them!Lots of places seem to have Moose in their name now, like moose mountain which the trail crossed today and the spruce moose shelter. Hopefully we get to see one during our travels! Speaking of names, we finished in Lyme New Hampshire, not to be confused with Lyme, Connecticut, where Lyme disease got its name.

Hopefully this was our last day with Sherpa on the trail and Porter behind the steering wheel. Our slack pack started at mile 331 when she sprained her ankle and ends today at mile 1790, the beginning of the White Mountains of New Hampshire. These mountains frequently pop above treeline for unpredictable weather and spectacular views. We had planned all along to ditch the car, and this is the time that made sense. While Sherpa knocked out the last section of trail between us and the Whites, Porter spent the day at the spa, the laundry spa that is, and running lots of other errands. Need a new lighter, gotta pick up batteries, what snacks should we get, all the little stuff that makes a 400 mile backpacking trip achievable. We will undoubtably get too much and temporarily lose our ultralight status. When we hung up our backpacks, they weighed less than 30 lbs combined. With errands done, she picked up a pizza for lunch. There were lots of rowdy drunk bikers at the pizza place. When they left, the remaining customers and workers seemed to breath a sigh of relief. Porter overheard a nearby patron whisper to the bartender, ""you know the difference between a Harley and Hoover vacuum? The Hoover only holds one dirtbag.""The trail passed over smart mountain, over cube mountain, and had nice flatish sections in between. Smart mountain had a nice fire tower. Cube mountain had some exposed areas, a foretaste of the whites coming next week. At our last crossing before finishing, Porter kept hearing laughter coming from the woods. Sherpa investigated and found the Omelette man. This guy cooks omelettes for thru hikers, even at 6pm!

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547629,"Today, we continued our tradition of taking a zero on Sunday to spend the day together and worship with other Christians. The weatherman pastor from last week in Londonderry, VT, had a friend in Lincoln, NH. who also pastors a church. This was not at all the typical Sunday experience. Instead of a building, there was an outdoor amphitheater on top of a mountain. Transportation was a gondola. Wood benches instead pews. (Not quite as nice as last weeks adirondack chairs). Mulch instead of carpets. The loon mountain ministry is affiliated with skiers and snowboarders for Christ. During the summer, they meet anyways. One of the songs we sang had these words:""When through the woodsAnd forest glades I wanderAnd hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.When I look down from lofty mountain grandeurAnd hear the brook, and feel the gentle breeze""Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to theHow great thou art!""Those words are the theme of our hike! While at church, we chatted with some really awesome bikers who were part of a Christian biker ministry. They even prayed with us. Completely opposite of Porters experience at the pizza place yesterday. The church had a potluck lunch at a nearby house where we really got to see the life of the church. There the pastor shared a really funny story about a funeral he had recently officiated. They were scattering someone's ashes over a lake, and the son who did it forgot to check the wind. As he let the ashes go, they flew back on everyone. One of the grandkids shouted, ""we're breathing in grandma!"" The son's comment about his error was ""even in her death, she got the last laugh.""

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547674,"Last night, we stayed at ""The Notch"" hostel. We were delighted to see a few familiar faces, including Dancing Moose, who now calls himself Mosse Dancer. We last saw him in Tenessee just before Devils Fork. He was going really fast and seemed determined to reach Katadyn early. He met a girl on the trail the same day we last saw him. He seems content with a slower pace now and is still hiking with her. They call this pink blazing. There may be a correlation. The march up from Kinsman notch was like stair master on steroids. No switchbacks at all, just a stone path vaguely resembling stairs. After a couple mile repute, the stairs returned with a vengeance, taking us to the top of Mt Wolf. After making our way down, we traversed a lowland that had a beautiful pond. Unfortunately, views were hard to enjoy sitting for lack of scenic overlooks. We settled for eating lunch under some power lines with a view of a valley and lake. On the way up to Kinsman mt., the trail followed beautiful waterfalls during the initial ascent. The climb up seemed to go on forever, but the reward was worth it. A hiker at breakfast this morning complained that it was like going up a really steep broken escalator. We agree with their assessment. Thankfully, we are not carrying our packs yet. The Notch offers slackpacking very cheaply. Unfortunately, we missed our pickup because we didn't realize there was a .7 mile sidetrail to the parking not lot and spent too much time on the mountain. Thankfully, there wee some bikers in the parking lot that graciously agreed to ferry us back to the Hostel.As we hiked, we chewed on some morsels of spiritual food. Lately, it has been our custom to read a chapter from the book of Proverbs each day. Since there are 31 chapters, it allows you to do the whole book each month. Today we talked about proverbs 29 as we hiked. Speaking of the 29th, today is our 6 monthiversarry. Time flies! especially, when you are with the right one. Poor planning almost led to staying a night in a bunkhouse style hostel.

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547846,"This morning, after waking up, we did one last pack shake down (ditched Sherpa's beloved anti monkey butt powder to save an ounce), enjoyed a simple oatmeal breakfast, borrowed a daypack from our hotel (mount Liberty lodging, such awesome friendly people), and drove over to the home of a family that we met Sunday at church who graciously offered to babysit our chariot for the next month as we continue with just backpacks. We visited with them, and headed to the trail, all before 10am! What did you do with your morning? Today we are officially at the starting point of the white mountains, although we slack packed the next section yesterday for logistics reasons with our car.Today's hike was short, less than 10 miles. We are planning to do fairly short days they the whites until Porter finds her trail legs. We took our time on the way up, and during a break, we stopped and chatted with ""Scavenger"", a young thruhiker who was sitting on the trail reading a Harry Potter book. When we told him about Porters ankle injury, he in turn shared with us that he had to take 26 days off to nurse an injury. During that time, he lived with a communal Christian group called 12 tribes. These are the same folks who gave out soup early in Georgia to thruhikers. Apparently, they have a commune near Harper's Ferry. It was fascinating to hear about life with them. They sound a lot like a messianic Jewish kabbitz. They have all things in common, start and end their days at 6 with a gathering of songs about yeshua, dancing, stories, and bible lessons. In between gatherings, they work an organic farm where they grow most of their own food and raise their livestock. The people live together in shared houses. One was a cabin called a hostel and was for people passing through such as hikers. The others had a room for the single brothers, sisters, and the families. He described the people as always trying to be better, apologizing for wrongs, very open about their pasts (for instance some were ex heroin addicts). Many are former thru hikers or failed thru hikers. We are not about to go join fringe church movements, but it sounds like a more positive place for many of them searching in comparison to alternatives offered by the world.Today was Sherpa's first day sporting his new shoes. He got the same exact ones he had put over a 1000 miles on. Porter, on the other hand, has roughly 150 miles on her Vasque hiking boots, is starting to have some minor wear and tear including tread separation. She also has some incipient blisters forming. Perhaps she will be trading hers in for the la Sportiva wildcats as well. As we continued our casual stride, we met some nature enthusiast day hikers with the biggest camera lense we had ever seen. They were taking a picture of the bitter blue berries, aka blue beaded lilies. Don't eat them! They were kind enough to give us some vitamin I (ibuprofen) which Porter gladly accepted, still sore from yesterday.At the top of 4800 ft mt moosilauke, we sat down for lunch with Thor and Rocket! They were excited to see Sherpa and finally meet Porter. Since we last saw them, their friend school bag got off the trail, and Rockets girlfriend, Harpoon, had joined them for several long days. Even she couldn't keep up with them and had to say ""see ya later"" after a 22 mile day and a 17 mile day. Sad we missed her. They told us the secret to their speed, they don't carry a tent. Actually, rocket broke down and got one because of the bugs. Thor is toughing it out still! The top of the mountain was wind swept and had no trees. It looked like something in Colorado but with plenty of air... We started our 4.5 mile downhill trek to the trailhead at 3:45pm. The trail down was pretty steep. It followed a beautiful waterfall for about a mile.. Thankfully, our shuttle arrangements today are more flexible than yesterday when we hitched back after missing the pickup window. The owners of the hotel came and picked us up when we called. After heating up dinner, they gave us a ride to get ice cream at a local joint. Such nice people. They keep probably the nicest and most organized hiker box along the trail. We secretly wonder if they stock it. The best find was some shoe glue! We would recommend Mount Liberty Lodge to anyone.

We climbed a fairly steep trail for a couple hours in light rain before having lunch at Liberty springs campground, which is a few miles in. We then continued our climb to Mt Lafayette. This must be the most beautiful place on the Appalachian Trail yet! The approach is a ridge above tree line with dropoffs a thousand feet down on both sides that slowly makes its way to the peak while allowing for 360 views. The wind was blowing really strong. Just before we reached the top, the sun began to pierce through the overcast day, offering spectacular lighting.   The top was beautiful, and just a few minutes after we started our descent, thick dark clouds rolled in and concealed the top.As we continued to hike, we decided to push for the garfield shelter 3 miles away. These are the kind of miles you really feel like you earned. Just a small bump on the map, the hike up and down Mt Garfield, which poked its head above tree line, was very difficult way to end our first day back on the trail. On our way up, we met a hiker who was exhausted, out of water, and had a hurting knee. We felt bad that he was camping for the night with know water and gave him a litre. His name was Tao. We made it to the top just as it was getting dark, but now didn't have water to make dinner. We quickly did a night hike down to the Garfield camping area which had water. We actually stayed in the shelter, which was a first for us. It was fairly empty because most thruhikers would rather ""stealth camp"" (camp off the trail)!then pay the $10 fee imposed by the AMC to camp at their maintained backcountry facilities. Happy to report there were no mice bothering us. We shared the shelter with Conor, Tony, and Chris, locals enjoying the mountains. They were farmers and hiked in with fresh vegetables and meat. After 3 days without refrigeration, we were afraid to try their bacon and sausage filled dishes, even though the carrots, onions, and potatoes looked great.","NH, Franconia Notch at US 3, 1816.0

The white mountains have a series of huts with little cafes and hotel rooms in the backcountry that are only accessible by hiking. They serve full meals to their guests, and offer leftovers and soup to hikers. Future family vacations? It is so beautiful here!From the hut, there was a 3/4 mile steep climb to south twin peak, and from there, the rest of the day was generally downhill. The end of the day was the flattest 5 miles we have seen in a long time. About 2 miles were a boardwalk through a swamp. When we reached our destination, we gladly slept in the shelter, which had room for us.On the hike, we chatted awhile with Toa, the hiker who we had given water two yesterday. He has an interesting story. He walked out of seminary and left following the Lord to seek truth elsewhere and has been wandering ever since, synthesizing his own religion out of the many sacred texts of the world. He heard a quote that he adapted as his motto. The original quote was ""Follow those who seek the truth and run from those who have found it."" He modified it to say ""Join in the procession with those who seek the truth, and love all the more adamantly those who claim to have found it."" Stephen R. Burchett (Tao). There are lots of seekers on the trail, unfortunately we concluded after lots of conversation that he was not one of them.

We were on the trail before 8AM. The first part of our hike was a 3 mile descent to a road crossing. This was the only easy part of our day. As we made our way down to notch, we stopped for water. As Sherpa filtered the spring water, a friendly chipmunk was happy to help himself to a few nuts from our packs. Our goal today was to reach ""lake of the clouds hut"". They charge around $100 per person for guests, but allow a small number of thruhikers to stay free in a small area with 6 bunks known as the dungeon. Even with our early start, there were 4 hikers ahead of us. On top of that, we ran into Thor, who was waiting at the bottom for Rocket, who had stopped to pick blueberries. They are very fast, and we didnt have much of a chance of reaching the shelter before them, but we held out hope. Over the next three miles, we climbed right back up to the elevation that was lost over the previous 3 miles, reaching a steep area called the Webster cliffs. We then scrambled up rocks for about a mile before having a long snack with a phenomenal lookout at the top of the cliffs. We had gotten some good news along the way. We passed 2 of the 4 hikers that were ahead of us and learned that they were stopping before the lake of the clouds hut. In addition, we were told that there are 4 work for stay spots also, meaning there is room for 10 total hikers. We optimistically pushed forward.We reached the mizpah hut 3 miles further (about nine miles total) around 3:30pm and bought lunch. They were serving southwestern pork and bean soup and creamy potato beef soup with the best corn bread we ever had. We also had some chocolate cake. Yum! We chatted a bit with a few other thru hikers. One guy was asking to help in the kitchen in exchange for food. He said, jokingly I may look homeless but I'm not! Another of them named Bailey said ""we aren't homeless, we are home free!"" quoting her brother. We liked the quote. Right before we left, Tao showed up and said to Porter, you are always smiling. Her reply was ""there is always a reason to smile"".We then pushed on up the last 5 miles to the lake of the clouds hut. We took our time and enjoyed the views, catching sunset as we got to the hut. It felt like another planet with incredible views. When we reached the hut, there were tons of thruhikers, but they had all opted to do a work for stay. We were the only thru hikers who chose the dungeon, which we shared with a couple section hikers. It was fun seeing Thor and Rocket here as well. We got a nice bowl of chili and pulled pork for dinner from one of the workers. We made a point to give her a good tip for taking care of us. She was so caught off guard, she said, ""wow!

Sherpa used a wool blanket that was left in there by the staff. Two hikers doing the presidential traverse came in as well. One was bragadocious and told of how he used the room to escape a blizzard while doing ice climbing nearby. He also was proud that he got eye infections from leaving his contacts in overnight frequently and tried to convince his friend to do the same. The friend wasn't buying it. They had some leftover breakfast at the hut which sustained us up Mt. Washington. There really could not have been better weather for the hike. It was crystal clear with no winds. We had a leisurely break at the summit, eating snack, writing postcards, using our phones, etc. The top of mt Washington was another high pointer in the bag for us, the highest point in New Hampshire.The descent really took a lot out of us. The trail was basically a rock scramble all the way to the bottom. Along the way, there was a group from a university doing research. They asked if we felt like it was too crowded and recorded our answers. We told them we were happy lots of people were using the parks. They asked during a busy holiday weekend which was undoubtably skewing their answers. We stopped for a snack at Madison springs hut, which is the last hut before getting to the road. They gave us chicken Parmesan for free to strengthen us for the rest of our hike. We were so grateful.

They had a sign out that said ask about how to get a free lunch.

We leap frogged with Captain Planet today several times. He had a really good analogy for the trail. He said that hiking the trail was kind of like eating a meal. The beginning, Georgia thru Virginia is like the meat and potatoes. The middle section including Pennsylvania is like the vegetables. The Northeast is like dessert! It is so beautiful out here.

It was really hot and all uphill. To make matters worse, the Burger King breakfast left both of our stomachs in knots and feeling tired. It ended up not being a leisurely afternoon at all. We were completely exhausted and still thirsty by the end of it. One thing that was nice was that we have started to see southbounders that we know.

While Sherpa fetched water from a nearly dried up spring, porter chatted with them. Ages were 12, 14, and 15. The mom sold their house in Coral Springs, Florida in January. They began walking North from Key West,slowly making their way thru Florida mostly along the ECT. As they hiked roughly 1000 miles in Florida, they told us the worst part was drinking from canals polluted with fertilizers, pesticides, and other agricultural runoff. They did use a bleach dropper to treat the water. They complained about being mistaken for homeless people. For education, they were ""unschooled"". It was a little painful to watch them try to read a sign marking the trail. They had jumped up to Maine after hiking most of Florida and have been slowly making their way south with their two dogs. They were really excited to be getting off the trail in less than 6 miles, because their mom had bought a house in Missouri for $16k and they needed to fix some things before winter. We said goodbye and walked away. We eventually passed the mom, happily chatting away on her phone, we told her that the kids were waiting for her less than 10 minutes up the trail. As it got dark, we started praying that we would find a good place to setup our tent. The woods were really dense and we were still going uphill which generally means you can't put up a tent. Right as it was getting dark we spotted a stealth site on a cliff! It was awesome. We had dinner with a view of mount Washington in the distance from a giant exposed rock. Porter inspected her feet and noticed a nail that looked like it might have seen better days. Sherpa told her she wouldn't be getting a pedicure with a foot like that, but she was quick to respond that she would get 10 percent off since she only had 9 toes to work on.","NH, US2, hikers paradise hostel, 1890.8

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548367,"We woke up on a cliff to a beautfiful view. Cranberry came while we were about to have breakfast and said good morning. Cranberry is a Swiss hiker we have been passing on and off for about a week that Porter has really taken a liking to. Maybe if we go to Switzerland some day we will visit her. We started our hike still thirsty from the day before. It seems like the options for water are either dust from dry streams or pond runoff which is not very clear. We filled up on green water but headed over to gentian pond shelter to see if there were moose and clear water. We found neither. On the way, we made it to Maine! It was a journey getting here but the big thing is we made it! Maine gives us a nice welcome and everyone else a kind farewell. The first mile was much easier than the one in New Hampshire leading up to the border. Unfortunately, the terrain was still very difficult. The trail has been getting more beautiful lately, as leaves have begun changing colors.As we continued hiking, we saw Goat gas again. He is a hiker that we first met in the smokies. We really were impressed at the time with his commitment. He is a scuba diving master and retired firefighter whose body has been abused by his past. He is now carrying his pack despite a bad back and makes very slow progress of a few miles a day. He started in January and flip flopped at macafee knob in Virginia. He hasn't quite hit a thousand miles yet but hopes to finish this year. We were glad he made it through the Mahoosic mile safely and that he was still pressing on.We decided to call it early because yesterday really wasn't as restful as we hoped. We stopped at Carlo Col shelter early and got clean water and a good nights rest. At the shelter, we chatted with ""Fine line"", a young Southbounder girl. She updated us that Polar bear and Odiga, the two travel nurses flip flopped and are already past us on their journey south. We were disappointed because we were really hoping to run into them one more time. We also shared the shelter with cranberry.","NH, stealth site near wockett ledge, 1899.3

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548368,"This morning, we woke up feeling refreshed. It is amazing how good you feel when you've had a good nights sleep and lots of water. Our morning hike included summitting 3 mountains before lunch. The trail here requires arms, legs, and often a dirty butt. There are steep sections that are much easier to climb then descend. Not sure what grade of mountaineering this is, but it definitely requires more than just feet. The trail is following something called the Mahoosic trail, which seems to be much more difficult than the rest of the trail. Glad we are going northbound instead of southbound. It seems like the majority of the steep parts are on the way up for us and there are ladders on some of the ways down. The big thing today was the Mahoosic notch. Touted as the most difficult mile on the trail, it is basically a rock scramble over boulders. We took about an hour and a half to pass through it. We put our trekking poles away. There was only one place where we took our packs off to squeeze through something. It was actually quite a bit of fun. We got a few scrapes, but the real tragedy was that the bottom of Sherpa's pack got a small hole due to scraping on the rocks. Definitely could have moved quickly without packs. We really enjoyed it, but suppose if we came back in our sixties to do this section, we would probably think it was really difficult. We had heard so many stories about the section. One person told us of 100 foot crevasses that you could fall into that were filled with lost trekking poles. We never saw anything like that...The Mahoosic arm, which immediately follows the notch, is a very steep climb out of the notch. It was no joke either. Very, very steep. After finishing both of them, we were exhausted and stopped at a nearby shelter. We were the only ones in the shelter because it is a pay shelter and thruhikers like to save money by camping in the woods. We were happy to have it to ourselves with a bear box and the cleanest privy on the whole trail a stones throw away. One hiker put an entry in the log book at the shelter, calling them the ""Mahoosic crotch and armpit"" to let everyone know what they thought about it.","ME, Carlo Col Shelter, 1907.8

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548398,"This morning, after sleeping in the shelter alone, we got breakfast ready and prepared for an easy day. The clouds were low so we had no views from old speck, the first mountain we climbed. Then after hiking 4 miles to a road crossing, we had the folks at the Cabin hostel in Andover, ME pick up our packs so we could slackpack the next 10 miles without carrying the weight.Before leaving the campsite, we chatted with Allison, the AMC shelter host, while eating our breakfast and learned that she worked teaching English in Peru before this season of being a shelter host. When asked what she is going to do next, she answered that perhaps she'll work at a ski resort or go get her EMT certification so she can be a ski patrol. At the bottom, ""Hopper"", a former thruhiker met us from the cabin to pick up our packs, and brought us Popsicles. Porter has been craving Popsicles for weeks and was very excited! Thankfully, the clouds lifted and the rest of the day was beautiful. The hike took us over bald pate, a mountain with spectacular views because it had no trees. It was a rock slab that we hiked up. We were thankful that it was not wet.When we finished, the cabin picked us up and brought us back to their hostel. They cooked hamburgers for dinner. Sherpa had been craving burgers for the last week and was thrilled. We had arranged for private accommodations. The family that runs this hostel, honey and bear, are a really sweet couple in their 80s. They have set up a bunk room downstairs and about 6 pop up campers in their yard. The camper we were supposed to stay in had a bunch of mice move in right before us! One dropped into our pillow as another climbed into the bedding. The couple relocated us to the bunkhouse and set traps immediately. It did make for an exciting evening. After we were in bed, an older hiker from Switzerland named Cranberry showed up. We had been seeing her on an off the last week and were wondering how she would fair across the Mahoosic mile. She came in with her shirt and pants covered in blood. Apparently she had fallen and hit her head and then bled a lot. She seemed to be alright after getting cleaned up.","ME, Speck Pond Shelter, 1917.3

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548399,"Today, we woke up at the cabin hostel to a delicious home cooked breakfast. Eggs, sausage, blueberry pancakes, melon, biscuits with homemade jelly, yum! We slack packed again today to continue recharging after the difficult white mountains and Mahoosic trail. Instead of doing the next section of trail, which was only 10 miles from east B road to south arm road, we decided to save that for tomorrow after church and did a slightly longer section today. We started at Maine 17, close to an hour drive, and walked southbound back towards the hostel.There has been very little rain here. Dried up blueberries that never made it past buds were an ever present reminder. They say that the changing of the leaf colors will be more brown this year because of the drought. The hike was noticibly easier today. Some of it was the terrain which is less demanding and some of it was our feeling recharged after slackpacking yesterday. At one point, we came to a sign that pointed to a stream and looked at our map to see how much further we had to go before summitting bemis peak. It turned out that we had actually already climbed it and came back down without realizing it. Needless to say the hike was not too difficult. We came up old blue, our last peak, and were surprised that we had already reached the top. Normally we celebrate when we get thru the hardest part of a climb for the day with something like a pop tart or snickers. Today we decided to put it away and wait for a different mountain to celebrate because we didn't feel like we quite earned it.On the way over to the trailhead, we chatted with hopper in the car. We traded stories about some people who shouldn't venture into the woods by themselves and were surprised when we realized we were actually talking about the same person! The hikers name will remain anonymous, but here is the story. She started hiking Northbound on the Appalachian trail from springer mountain, Georgia in February of 2016. Shortly after beginning her hike, she woke up in a pool of frigid water in her hammock in the middle of the night, got up and wandered into the woods. After getting lost, hypothermia set in. This led to a bout of pneumonia which led to permanent lung damage and effectively ended her hike northbound.   Armed with an inhaler, which she now has to carry because of the pneumonia, she set back out in July, this time as a southbounder from Maine. Two months later, she is still in Maine, making forward progress of about 4 miles a day. She told us first hand about her adventure in unpreparedness through the 100 mile wilderness, where she arranged for a food drop but could never find it, calling the directions a scavenger hunt. For the record, we have been assured that there are about 2 easily identifiable rocks behind which packages are placed. In any case, she made it through that 100 mile section on handouts from northbounder a who took pity on her. Hopper shared with us that she heard about the same hiker from some people she was slackpacking. Apparently, the hiker set her pack down and wandered into the woods armed only with toilet paper. She lost her bearings and couldn't find the trail again. The slackpackers noticed an unattended pack and called out to see if anyone was around. She yelled help several times as she approached, finally emerging from her restroom break victoriously, toilet paper and stick in hand. Th hiker really is about the sweetest person we have met and we really enjoyed visiting with her when we crossed paths a few days ago, but fear for her safety given her track record to date. She at least is planning to pause for the winter. She probably ought to pause her adventure permanently or at least hike with a buddy before something really bad happens. There is a fine line between dreams and nightmares. In her case, while pursuing the dream, she has sadly only found the other.As hopper dropped us off, we saw a thruhiker sitting on a bench at a trailhead. It was Jeff Davis! We hadn't seen him since before the Smokies. He thruhiked in 2012 and told us it took him 4 months to do the first 1800 miles and 2 months to do the last 400 because he enjoyed fishing. We were hoping he took the same approach this time around and were thrilled to cross his path again. He even invited us to a fishing hole he is stopping at in a few days. He confessed that he broke down and bought a tent this time because of the bugs, but he is one of those simple hikers, out for the experience instead of just reaching a destination. Contrast him with another hiker we passed today, an Italian woman who is just hiking the last 250 miles to Katadyn because she likes to do the famous hikes around the world and has hiked from Nepal to Kilimanjaro. We joked to ourselves that this was the first hike she was going to have to carry her own bag for. Both Jeff Davis and her are hiking the same trail but for different reasons. Everyone has one that is out here. The trail has a saying , ""hike your own hike"". For us, the Appalachian trail isn't about just climbing a mountain or reaching a peak. It's about the journey, meeting lots of people, and enjoying each other's company.","ME, South Arm Rd, 1942.3

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548400,"This morning we woke up to a delicious breakfast at the cabin. Honey made waffles shaped like barns and barn animals and we topped them with delicious homemade blueberry syrup. There was also all you can eat crispy bacon. It rained all morning, but that was fine with us, because we were staying back to go to church with the owners of the hostel. The trail will be nice and wet for us this afternoon.Church was a small bible believing fellowship. Apparently their pastor quit a few years ago and today was the official first sermon by the new pastor. He spoke about gifts and their role in a healthy church. Seemed like a nice group. Definitely was a small country church. Everyone at the church was thrilled with the small bit of rain.When we reached the trail, even the forest seemed happier after drinking some rain. We had a 10 mile section in front of us and got on about 12:30pm. The mountains here had some nice views but nothing quite nice enough to pull out a snickers bar for in celebration. We were secretly hoping we would catch up to and pass cranberry, who started at 8:15am. We enjoy her a lot, but she is a bit pokey. We passed her right before reaching the road- just in time to see her fall into a stream. She was alright except for wet shoes. The climbs and descents were not rough at all and we made pretty good time, finishing by 6:00pm without rushing too much. Dinner back at the cabin was homemade shepherds pie followed by moose tracks ice cream. Speaking of moose, we still haven't seen one but we feel like we are hot on their tracks. We have started to see lots of moose droppings along the trail.

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548617,"After another yummy home cooked breakfast, we said our goodbyes to honey and bear and hopped in the car with our packs for a ride with hopper back to Maine 17. Porter wondered aloud rhetorically if any hikers quit this far into the hike. Hopper was quick to let us know that a woman staying at the hostel lasts night was catching a ride to the airport today after walking 1950 miles. She just had anxiety issues and wasn't enjoying it. Wow! Hopefully most people who quit figure it out sooner.   The weather was cool but tolerable and sunny. The hike ahead was basically flat with no mountains to climb all the way to Rangeley. For some reason, we just never found our stride and ended up finishing late and tired. Thankfully, we had made a reservation with the farmhouse and didn't have to think about our evening plans during the day. As we hiked, we passed several pretty ponds, but did not meet any real moose. We did pass ""old moose"", a very knowledgable trail maintainer and assistant librarian. We showed him pictures of plants we had seen along the way and he new the names of all of them. We learned about edible berries, poisonous ones, names of flowers, etc. we even found out that the photographer we met on moosilauke wa using a common name ""blue bead Lilly"" for clintonia. After a nice conversation we went on our way. He was surprisingly chatty for an assistant librarian. The other highlight of the hike was coming to a privy in the middle of the trail with its own trail register. Apparently the trail maintainer had a sense of potty humor for placing it there. Needless to say, there were lots of crappy comments. It made for some good reading material while on the pot. Sherpa cleaned his hands thouroughly after reading the tainted logbook.We made poor time, and finished as it was getting dark. That wouldn't have been an issue, except that we were unable to get good enough cell service to call for the free shuttle into town, and it is very difficult to hitchhike after dark.    Town was about 8 miles away. We didn't worry, we prayed. Almost instantly, a car put its blinker on and turned into the parking lot. It was a father and daughter from the local church of the Nazarene. They had posted fliers for a hiker event they held over the weekend and were taking them down. They happily gave us a ride. God supplied our needs yer again. He is faithful. When we arrived at the farmhouse, they gave us a pizza because it was too late for dinner and put us in a really charming room.","ME, Maine 17, 1955.6

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548706,"We woke up to perfect weather today. While Porter was catching a shower, Sherpa chatted with the owner of the farmhouse about plans for the day. They offered a 15 mile slackpack option that wasn't in our guidebooks because it dropped you about a mile from the trail on an old logging road. Since we went slow yesterday on fairly easy terrain with our packs, and today's hike is over the saddleback which is not just a walk in the woods, we gladly payed for the shuttle. When other hikers found out, beast and big bird joined us, which helped split the cost even more. It was about an hour over bumpy dirt roads that we would have easily got lost in to the dropoff location. Thankful for the opportunity, we set out with a stomach full of granola and leftover pizza. As we began our ascent, we crossed paths with Ukelady, Bilbo, and frog King. Ukelady is a girl we met back in the smokies that we hadn't seen since who carries a ukelele. At a shelter along the way, we learned about hidden treasure in the 100 mile wilderness. Apparently, there are something like 9 weed smoking care packages complete with pipes stashed away for the diligent drug users... We won't be on the lookout. We also met a really cool group of northbound thruhikers on our hike today not far from that shelter. Flying piglet (12), hubbinator (15), twin sisters diva and zooboomafoo (17) are doing the hike as a family, but without parents. They seemed like very responsible sweet kids. Apparently their mother follows them with a chase vehicle and sees them about every other day.The perfect weather really made the hike from little horn to saddleback mountain enjoyable. The section is an exposed ridge line connecting the two peaks. With 360 views, supposedly you can see mt Washington and mt Katadyn on a day like today. All the mountain peaks sort of looked the same to us, but maybe we did see them... Not even one cloud in the sky. Thank you Lord! On top of saddleback we chatted a bit with mogly and Captain Planet before calling successfully for our ride and beginning our descent. We got a special treat on the way down. We saw treehugger and mermaid! We last saw them in the smokies. When we met them, Mermaid had a memorable laugh which someone on the next hill over had mistaken for coyote pups yipping. Our ride was waiting for us when we finished the trail and they brought us in for dinner in nearby Rangeley. A hiker named omega joined us when we ate.

As we were hanging out a truck pulled in dropping off a hiker who had hitched a ride from the nearby town. We caught a ride back with the same person and found out that we had met him hiking yesterday on the trail. He and his girlfriend joined us for lunch at a community center.

We woke up a little early and were on our way shortly after 0600. One of the other hikers was concerned about his speed so he requested a super early start so he wouldn't be hiking in the dark. We're rooting for him! After hiking the ""bonus mile"" approach trail to get back to the where we left off yesterday, we started our hike at 0745.

We began our climb and had breakfast a little ways up lone mt. We walked with big bird most of the morning. Big bird is a NICU nurse like Porter so there was a lot to talk about. As the day progressed, we summitted three 4000 foot mountains, including spaulding mountain and both of the crockers. Sadly, there really wasn't much to see today because the mountains did not pop above treeline. We did hit a huge milestone today. Towards the end of our hike, we crossed the 2000 mile mark!

The group included Beast, Big Bird, Mermaid, Tree Hugger, Constantine, and us. We are friends with everyone in this micro bubble so it was a nice day. We arranged to have the bags dropped off at the end of the day after crossing over the Bigalows, the last 4000foot mountains before Katahdin.
We easily traversed over the mountains, briefly chatting with Captain Planet as we progressed. We found out from him that there is someone else on the trail called ""Captain Planet"". To remedy the potential confusion, he now goes by ""the artist formerly known as Captain Planet"" but everyone still just calls him by his name. He went at his own pace, which is faster than ours, and headed up the mountain. We saw him again at the top of Avery peak, having lunch with Big Bird. We did not know that they were friends on the trail and didn't think anything of it. There was a really nice spot that looked like it used to be the base of a fire tower, or something similar. Either way, it provided welcome shelter from wind. The peaks can be quite chilly, because there are no trees blocking wind.

Coming down from the mountain, we saw treehugger and Constantine hanging out. Mermaid was nowhere to be seen. Mermaid is engaged to treehugger, but they do not hike together. They met Constantine in Damascus and treehugger keeps pace with him and they take lots of smoke brakes together- Mermaid told us she ""can't stand the disgusting habit"" and puts distance between her and it. We were excited that they were behind us because we are usually the slowest hikers in the pack and we really didn't want to be last today because that meant someone would be waiting for us with our packs. When we made it to the botttom, they had miraculously leapfrogged us on a blue blaze side trail which promised to be 4 miles shorter but let off at the wrong spot forcing to keep walking on a road a few extra miles. when we got to our packs, we saw the group. As typical, mermaid had picked up her pack and kept hiking. Big Bird apparently jumped on a free ride back to Stratton with Captain Planet and a trail angel. Supposedly she had a huge grin on her face. Hopefully we see them again.

Putting on packs after hiking 16 miles over mountains for a 1 mile flat walk around a lake sounds easy, but it felt like someone filled up our bags with bricks. We pushed on to a really beautiful campsite where the crew had already built a waterfront fire... Thanks beast!

Today was a very flat, fairly easy day. We got up in the morning, had a small climb, and then walked over mostly flat terrain with our backpacks for close to 20 miles. At the end of our hike, there is a river without a bridge called the Kennebec, which is dam controlled and cannot be safely forded because of the uncertain releases of water. Across the river is caratunk, a city of 70 people, that has two hiker hotels and a couple restaurants. The ATC hires a ferry service to help hikers across, which is really just a guy in a canoe. We had a dilemma because the ferry hours are 9AM - 2PM. Hoping to make it to church tomorrow, we knew we would need to get across the river today. But with 20 miles of hiking, it wasn't possible to reach the ferry early enough. With bad weather rolling in, there was even a chance that the ferry wouldn't run at all tomorrow and we would be forced to zero.
 After enjoying breakfast around the campfire which beast had resurrected this morning, we set off, uncertain of what he day would hold. After a few hours, beast flew by us. He is the fastest hiker we know which is how he got his name. He doesn't always cover much distance, but he has the amazing ability to just float right past everyone wherever he goes. We found a great place for lunch at a pond on a secluded rock. The view was spectacular. We reached the last shelter before the river and said hi to a lot of hikers stopped for the day. One of them we recognized from Georgia! He went by mountain goat back then. We shared our first hitch with him into Helen Georgia. Back then he had lots of fancy things like a safari hat and a satellite charger. We did too! Now he was ""strider"", and boy could he hike. He actually passed earlier in the day and we didn't recognize him. Lean, bearded, ultralight, and fast! After catching up, we said our see ya laters and pressed on towards the river.
Cell service was terribly, but we found a spot on a hill and got a call to go through. We called a motel on the other side of the river to see if there was any way to safely forge it. The owner said to us, ""not if you want to live"". He gave us the number of a lady named Cheryl Anderson who lives on the river and ferries hikers during the off hours. She must be trying to keep a low profile because she is not in any of the books, and none of the hikers knew there was a way across in the afternoon. We called her too and she told us she's be happy to, just yell when we get to the river. Encouraged, we headed on with a new skip in our step. We gladly shared our newfound info with Constanine, who joined us.
Hiking together with Constantine! Apparently Treehugger and Mermaid had stayed back in camp a long time and he decided to set out. Chatting as we went, he told us he is a dive master and spent time in Key Largo. He also has an associates degree and is planning to hike the pct next year before finishing school. As we were all chatting, Porter ""biffed"" it and cut her knee. She was fine though and got right back up. Our gang of 3 made it to the river, and to our surprise, Beast was waiting there chatting with the lady who does the after hours ferries. He didn't have any cash so the 3 of us chipped in to help him across the river before dark. The canoe was very rickety and the current was very strong. Several dams were releasing simultaneously... The canoe only held 3 people, so Sherpa grabbed an oar, Porter sat on a pack in the middle, and Cheryl steered. The idea was simple, just row as hard as you can and hopefully make it through the current without being swept downstream. We shoved off and almost immediately we were turned downstream by the current. Dodging rocks, we overshot the trail on the other side of the river by hundreds of yards as our canoe was swept downstream. Thankfully, we had avoided the rocks and didn't tip. Climbing onto shore, we walked the canoe back to the trail, where she then continued to walk it a significant ways upstream as we resumed our hike. There were the beautiful official canoes, all lined up taunting us as we left the shore.
After shuttling the others across, she met us at the nearby road crossing and gave us a ride to the Sterling Inn, a hiker friendly motel with a great resupply. Happy to be in town, across the river, away from rain, and in range of church we called it a night.","ME, Campsite, 2018.7

There was the Congregational church that had a service once in June, July, and August. And that was it. The next nearest church was 20 minutes away in Moscow. We called an elder and he was quick to give us a ride. He showed up exactly when he said he would and we hopped in. Beast surprised us when he heard that we were going and joined us. Constantine went to find Mermaid and Treehugger in the mean time. The elder that picked us up turned out to be the Sunday school teacher. The announcements were very thourough, going out past Christmas all the way to Easter 2017! One cool thing they did at Sunday school was a sanctified open mic. The pianist took requests for hymns. The teaching was a very thourough exposition of the Bible. We would have confused it for a service had another not immediately followed. With the reading of the same announcements to mostly the same people, the real service began. Such a joy to fellowship with brothers and sisters who loved the Lord. Especially when it seemed so impossible less than 24 hours prior. Another answered prayer.
We had arranged for a slack pack from the owner of the Sterling Inn. His son picked us up as the service finished. He is one of so many that doesn't know he needs the Lord. Now he knows where a church is- who knows? The dropoff point had us walk south back to the hotel. When we started, the rain had recently stopped. It feels like it pays to go to church! This is the second time we missed the rain in a sanctuary. Unfortunately, the rocks were slippery. Beast gave us a head start as we headed up over a gentle mountain standing between us and the motel. We both slipped and fell at least once despite proceeding with extreme caution. After getting past the top, the rocks were much easier to traverse and it quickly became a dirt trail. Thankfully it wasn't too muddy. When we approached the end, Beast came up out of nowhere from behind. Sherpa kicked it into high gear though and we finished together. There is no cell service anywhere in the town so we walked back to the hotel with our thumbs out. We got a bonus hiking mile before getting picked up. Back at the inn, hungry, we caught a ride with the owner of the inn and his son and went to a restaurant with them. Lobster Mac and cheese for Porter. Lobster roll for Sherpa. Perfect finish to the day.","ME, US 201 at Caratunk, 2037.9

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549933,"This morning, we woke up at the Sterlng Inn in Stratton, enjoyed breakfast with Beast, settled up for the room, and caught the shuttle back to the trail. We started just before Moxie Bald Mountain, and climbed about 1500 feet in the first few miles. We were fresh and the climb didn't slow us down, even with our packs. For once, the trail builders showed some restraint and didn't make us go over the North Peak, instead offering a side trail and a good view. After descending the mountain, the trail crossed the Piscataquis River, (we were able to ford it without getting wet). We then followed the river for 5 miles. We were starting to feel tired by the the end of it. The elevation profile looked flat but there were rolling hills, rocks, and roots which sapped our energy. Porter threatened to write a letter to the conservancy when she found out we had to cross the river a second time. The trail never really just goes North... The trail was strangely empty today. We only saw two weekend hikers and someone going southbound the whole day. We knew there were 3 ways to get to Monson, and were secretly hoping on reaching the furthest one today so that we could start the 100 mile wilderness tomorrow. We had run out of water about 10 miles before Monson and hoped to find some but never did. Without water, we had no choice but to keep pushing on. When we reached the first road, there was no traffic at all so we had to push on. We thought the next option was close to Monson but when we got to it, it turned out to be a 3 mile blue blaze trail into the city that would have only saved us a mile. It was actually the old AT route. We saw Turnip and Nora camping at the trailhead. They invited us to join in them, but we had no water and had to continue on. It got dark around 7pm. Shortly after dark, we came to the top of a hill and found cell phone service. We called Shaws, a local hostel in Monson, and they had one private room available. They told us that they had been completely full but someone had just cancelled. God is so good. If we had called any earlier we would have been turned away. He knew our needs. Sometimes we really push the miles. Can't believe we did 25 miles today! That's a record for us together. They even picked us up after dark. The owner's parents picked us up. They were in town visiting and were very kind. They took us to a nearby gas station to buy food, and waited as it was prepared. They then drove us up to the hostel where we checked in, ate, and immediately went to sleep. There was a quote on the wall of the hostel that summed up the hike decently. ""The trail is a great metaphor for life, for learning how to enjoy the journey."" Jarrod Hester (owner of Shaws)","ME, Troutdale Road, 2049.8

The Hitched Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549934,"We did it! We summitted Katadhin and took a cool picture together.   Said goodbye to lots of fellow hiker friends.   Today was not the end for us, both figuratively and literally. Literally, because we had to skip the 100 mile wilderness. Sherpa came down with a High fever the night we checked into Shaws, was bedridden for a week, and is still weak 10 days later. Hikers can always muster the strength to summit Katadhin though. The 100 miles will still be there for us some other time. Figuratively, because while our honeymoon may be drawing to a close (after a few weeks in New Zealand), our lives together our just beginning. We will surely miss the simplicity of waking up to the sun, wearing a single set of clothes, and undistracted time together. There are some luxuries we are really looking forward to though, like having separate deodorant sticks again (saved a few ounces by chucking one). We are also looking forward to using our wedding gifts. The fondue pot. Oh, the pasta maker. And boy are we ever looking forward to our home and our own bed, (not that we've ever really slept in it together yet- we waited for marriage to enjoy our bed, but went straight to Costa Rica and then started this hike a couple weeks later lol).
One of our Houston friends came out and did the hike with us. Sure helped us appreciate how well conditioned we are watching him struggle up and back down the mountain! It's a nice analogy for life really. The hike isn't easy, and neither is life, but making it through is rewarding! And just as the hike itself prepares you for the more difficult parts, life experiences prepare you for the difficult places you'll go through. It's a picture of marriage as well. We had 4 big trials while on the trail including Porter twisting her ankle which changed our hike to a slackpack, Sherpa getting sick which prevented us from doing the 100 mile wilderness, and a couple other things we didn't share on ther blog.   But we have grown closer together and closer to the Lord while spending this time together. The bible says, ""many are the afflictions of the righteous"" in Psalm 37. God never promises a smooth journey, but He is there the whole time. We felt His love so many times, and saw his hand provide in incredible ways. Like praying for a ride after dark when hitch hiking was hopeless and having a pastor pull into the driveway in Rangeley, like calling for a room in Monson just before getting sick and having a place to recover even though it was fully booked, and so many other answered prayers that we have shared on the blog. God has been faithful to us.
 We have tried to share a little bit about what is like to follow the Lord through our blog. If you know the Lord, hopefully it resounded with you, and if you don't know the Lord, he wants a relationship with you. Not just church attendance , not just memorizing a set of beliefs that you can repeat as needed. He desires that you know him. The apostle Paul said, ""I know the one in whom I have believed."" If you do not know Jesus, you do not have that relationship. Isaiah says ""your sins have separated you from God"". Jesus came to this world out of obedience, sent by God to pay for your sins with his death. When you put your faith in that, you begin a journey far more exciting than the Appalachian Trail! Everyday you get the privilege of fellowshipping with your creator. You get peace. You get cleansed of your filth. You experience forgiveness. You are filled with joy. And you have the hope of eternity. Happy trails!
