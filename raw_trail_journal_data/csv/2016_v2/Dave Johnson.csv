Dave Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/510066,"I'm 52 years old and have worked the same job and same company for 34 years. You could say my career path never came to a fork. Pretty much the same thing for the past 20 years has tired me out. In March of 2015, I sold a big part of my company and have been working on removing myself from the day to day. Planing this hike gives me an ""out"", because in March 2016 I will be doing another kind of work and be experiencing many forks, I just hope I take the right ones. My wife supports this adventure and knows that it's the first selfish thing I've attempted in 30 years. She plans to join me for a couple of days every 5-6 weeks along the way and keep things taken care of at home.I truly appreciate the sacrifices she will be making during this time.I'm looking forward to a real change of routine and hope to be a better father, husband and person when I come home in August 2016.Dave","

Dave Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/506441,"I've been contemplating an AT hike for about a year and a half, and within the last 6 months have decided to share my plans with a few close friends, and recently a few not so close friends and now I'll tell anyone who will listen about my plans.   
I'm not the cheerful Polly Anna who is looking to have a spiritual transformational experience as the goal for my hike. I just want to get away from my routine of 30 years and the responsibility of raising a family and running a business. 
My posts won't contain poems or pondering of the universe, hopefully I can share some practical advice for any folks preparing for hikes of their own.
The goal is to stay healthy and injury free while pushing my mind and body daily. 
I know there will be changes and I embrace and accept whatever they are as I begin the journey. 
Keeping it Real, 
Dave","

Dave Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508596,"I've come up with a preliminary equipment list. I have it on a spread sheet if anyone would like a copy. I have most of the items (I think I will need) and will purchase the remaining things I need if I can catch a sale on REI or CampSaver. 
I have a couple of shake down hikes scheduled for September and October to test things out. 
I've gathered a bunch of information from Erik the Black's website www.blackwoodspress.com He has a common sense approach to ultra light hiking. I want to keep my pack weight in the 30 pound range.

Dave Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512124,"This past weekend my wife Christine, my dog Maizy (Quite Possibly The World’s Greatest Dog) went out for a weekend hike. We left Carver’s Gap at the Tennessee/NC border mid afternoon on Friday and hiked 5 miles to Over-Mountain Shelter.   The “shelter” really is a barn with a second floor fire pit and privy, deluxe accommodations! On Saturday we hiked over Little Hump Mountain and then Hump Mountain where we set up and stretched out on a hammock (Maizy too) and rested for an hour after nice lunch of PB&Js. We hiked back to Over-Mountain Shelter for a total of 8 miles. On Sunday we hiked the 5 miles back up to Carver’s Gap, which is a pretty steady up hill. You think I would have noticed on Friday that we were doing a considerable amount of descending. Sounds like a pretty easy weekend hike? It was enjoyable but it was hard. I’m in pretty good shape but the muscles required to carry a 35 pound pack and step up and down for hours have been awakened. And on Sunday they weren’t too happy about it.   Over the weekend I learned several things. The most important thing to do is to take any opportunity to hike hills between now and March and secondly is I will evaluate EVERYTHING that I put in my pack no matter how small or light. Overall it was a success and I look forward to our next trip in late September. Dave","Carver's Gap

Dave Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515002,"The first of several planned practice hikes got off to a wet start.
My buddy Monty, who who was not interested in learning about wet weather hiking, postponed the trip one day hoping to catch better weather.
I'm not disappointed that we still caught some pretty bad weather.
I was anticipating cooler temps but it was in the upper 60's during the day and lower 60's at night.
We hiked 6.4 miles Sunday, 8.8 on Monday and 9.6 on Tuesday with Tuesday being the wettest day of them all.
What I learned...
1st You will meet some pretty interesting people on the trail. 
We met and hiked with Matthew ""Kokopelli"" a 68 year old guy from Texas, he looked like Willie Nelson and sounded like Mathew McConaughey. Also a fellow named Scott ""Just Enough"" who is semi homeless and had some ""different"" quirks but overall he was a pretty funny and genuine guy.
At first I was a bit skeptical but after several days I found I really enjoyed getting to know more about each of their stories.
2nd There is no need for rain gear if it's above 65 degrees. 
We hiked in shorts and short sleeve shirts, and just wrung out our cloths and wore them to semi-dry while in the shelters. 
3rd It sucks to put up a tent in the rain.
I was thinking about making a Tyvek tarp 6' x 8' that I could put up between trees fairly quickly and then put my tent up under that if caught in bad storms. I've calculated it would weigh about 9 ounces. I'd love any feedback on this idea. My pack weight with 4 days of food and 2L water is about 30 lbs. 
Overall it was a good trip the rain definitely gets everything inside your pack wet so I'm glad the Sea to Summit dry sacks worked. 
My next adventure is a week at the AT Institute with Warren Doyle October 12th-16th. I'm really looking forward to meeting a guy that has thru hiked the AT a world record 16 times. Imagine 8 years of your life hiking the AT? A novice like me is bound to learn a lot.
Monty had suggested a few trail names for me but none were too flattering so I will continue to take my chances.
