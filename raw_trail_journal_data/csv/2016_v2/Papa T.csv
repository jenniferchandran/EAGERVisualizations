Papa T,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527514,"And so it truly does begin. It seems really surreal to be adding my own journal entries after following Trail Journals for over a decade. The AT has been ""on my mind"" for almost 50 years. But like many people this thing called life occurred. A wonderful wife, two great children (now grown), and a career. Last year both my wife and I decided to retire. As early as last summer I started the process of replacing or upgrading my trail equipment. Things have come a long way since 1985 when I bought most of it. My original plan was to attempt a complete thru hike NOBO. But the more I considered it, several factors caused me to reconsider. I live in Oregon and there are many places I want to explore throughout the Northwest as well. Six months on the AT would eliminate a complete hiking season. There are also two grandsons I want to spend time with. Another factor is the trend that I have noticed in other journals that too many hikers have depleted their bodies by the time they get into New Hampshire and Maine. They talk more about hurts and miles and finishing that enjoying the journey. That's not for me. This year I plan to go from Springer to Fontana at a fairly leisurely pace and mostly slack packing. I want to enjoy the journey thoroughly. Maybe I will return and do another section in the fall. So, I hit the trail on April 21st. After the massive migrating horde and just when spring is really busting out in the mountains. Can't wait.","

Papa T,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527906,"The days are ticking off and today was a to do day. Had to get a haircut, get prescriptions sent in, getting cash, working on transport to the SeaTac airport. Also, gathered more equipment from storage and making final decisions on clothes. We had a couple of short but intense showers with hail, so I opted for doing a couple of miles with the backpack and a 20lb bag of rice on the treadmill. It is still a bit unreal to be putting entries on Trail Journals. Over the years there have so many great journals that vicariously took me away from the cube farm. Some of the journals stick with you. I remember so enjoying Jackie McDonald / Yogi's journals of both the AT and the PCT. Also have a special place for La Tortuga (who was probably about my speed) and her optimistic attitude and Walk Worthy's journal for his wonderful daily expression of living the Christian faith every day. Last year, I was also intrigued by Rocketman and Princess (who look to be doing it again). They really inspired the mostly slack pack approach i am taking that makes the most sense for me. My best vacations including Yosemite, Rocky Mtn. National Park, Arches, Canyonlands, Zion and Crater Lake have been basically base camps with daily slack packs. This section will be a bit more rigorous and extended version. Will add to the journal collateral about equipment etc. in the next day or so.","

Papa T,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527696,"Another prep day for the trail. Eye exam was first. I am going to go on sort of two tracks. My current contacts have not been very durable and I recently purchased some bifocals for the hike. Today I was provided with a trail package of some daily disposable contacts and will probably give them a try as well. Second, was about a 4.5 mile hike with about a 400 ft elevation change. It is one of the trails in our Benton County Park System called the Throop Loop trail and I added two other segments. Never been on these sections and they were a real treat. Fantastic views across the Willamette Valley for almost 270 degrees. Today had a fairly low overcast and the view was still terrific. Later the trail winds through oak savanna areas being restored, along the Mary's River and finished in some beautiful cattle farms. The wildflowers are now in full bloom and I also spotted a couple of elk on the ridge and several wild turkeys along the way. We are really fortunate to have a number of trails that range from 1 mile to 9 miles and many have elevation changes of 800 - 1400 feet usually within a couple of miles. I live only about 20 miles from the Cascades and the national forest, but above 3000 feet it is still very white. Last week I was able to do the Opal Creek hike at about 2000 feet. That is such a beautiful hike with rushing water and so clear you can see to bottom everywhere.   Recently, i found some old hiking maps of Harriman State Park in NY. That was the first area that I experienced the AT as a teenager in Explorer Scouts. We had a couple of dads who would haul a half dozen of us up to a trailhead on Friday night and would pick us up on Sunday afternoon. A great escape for some kids from Queens. Over the years, I have had a chance to do a few short sections of the AT in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Virginia. No matter where my feet take me there is always some extra excitement to see those white blazes that lead on and on. Won't be long now.","

Papa T,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527908,"Well, today was an entire change of plans, and, as usual in this process, the Good Lord providing some sage guidance. The original plan was to get in a 7.4 mile trek. However, starting last night we have had driving rain, dropping temperatures, and wind 20-30mph with higher gusts. If I was out on trail already, this would be a zero day for sure. But also on the agenda was packing all the gear into a big duffel bag. I had considered only taking a fleece, but today caused my to reconsider and throw in the down jacket instead along with a warm underlay for my legs. Even though they temps this morning were in the mid-40's the ""feel like"" temperature was in the low 30's. How many times have I read journals where the hiker sent their winter stuff back too soon. Better to be warm than sorry. I checked the road cams this morning and everything over 4000 feet was white and the forecast is for 7-15 inches of snow up on Santiam Pass. Yikes. Springtime in the Cascades. I will definitely get a few more miles in over the weekend so keep the legs with at least a minimal base of fitness. For the last couple of years I barely was able to get on the trail. In that last two months I have been out 2-3 times week. What a joy.","

Party yesterday with the rest of the family and our 1 year old grandson. Both are a real blessing. Church this morning and a tough goodbye with my better half who had to drive back home to Oregon. Did 2.2 miles in a nearby county park with daughter, son-in-law, grandson, and their labrador retriever. Sunny and in the seventies.

Papa T,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528525,"Today is a ""down"" day or transition day. Tonight is a stay at a hotel near Sea Tac and then travel day tomorrow. I checked the weather this morning and the forecast has changed and Friday looks like it might be a bit wet on the trail. It is certainly beautiful weather here the last couple of days. Almost everyone I have spoken with about this journey has been really positive and encouraging. Other journals have reported friends and acquaintances with very different reactions. There is always the question, ""why do you want to do that?"" for everyone. For me, i can say for sure what it is not. Thankfully, it is not to cope with the end of a relationship, a death of someone close to me, some mid-life crisis, or the loss of employment. Over the years, I have read a good number of journals where hikers have sought the AT as a catharsis for dealing with a lot of pain. My biggest pain will be missing my wonderful wife of almost 43 years and our 4 dogs, 4 cats, and the natural creatures that inhabit our little corner of the woods. What this experience is for me is a bit of adventure, exploration of someplace I have only read about. A walkabout of sorts very much in the trekking tradition of Thoreau or Muir. It's also a sort of inquiry into what God may have in mind or present along the way and being open to whatever that is. It is not a driving mission that some people take on while grinding out miles and where completing the trail is the only option. I have read a number of journals like that as well, and simply wonder, ""what for?"" Did you really see anything? Did you really enjoy the journey? But the axiom is very true that you have to hike your own hike...and I intend too. Happy Trails.","

Good variety and quality of inventory and helpful staff. Christine, who helped me was great and had also done the whole AT a couple of years ago. The other person on the sales floor had also done all of the AT. We stopped for lunch at a local burger place and as we were leaving she introduced me to their city public works manager and he had done 1100 miles of the AT. Small AT world.

Uphills tough with 40+ lbs on your back. Missed a side trail to a waterfall but heard it. Passed a really cool open patch that is maintained as a wildlife feeding area. Saw bear scat but no bears. Reached the shelter at about 1pm. Once again, most people are tenting and only Wanda, Susan (now named Juice) and Billy in the shelter. Woody said that when he stopped to chat with Gus. the ridgerunner, they saw several wild pigs/boars. I heard a rumble and headed to the creek to get water. Good move as we had several thundershowers move through about dusk. Thankfully, Wanda and Susan told me they snored, so in went the earplugs. Do they ever snore!

Papa T,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529444,"Interesting start to the morning. turned over about 6am and peaked out of the shelter. Foggy and I thought I was dreaming for a second. A white coyote was wandering through the area. Headed out about 8:30 and going at my pace. Absolutely perfect hiking day. sunny with a few clouds and occasional breezes with the temperature in the 60's. The two mountains before Sassafras were not shabby. Sassafras goes up 660 ft in .9 miles and then down over 350 feet. Downhill with 40 lbs or more on your back is also tough. When I got to Cooper Gap I was pretty tired. I looked at my guide data and realized that I could get picked up from there and spend the night at the Hiker Hostel and do a longer slack pack tomorrow with no loss in the schedule. so, called ahead and here I am. It took awhile for my pickup, which I expected. By 3pm only Woody had caught up to me. Sassafras was taking its toll on everyone. The Hiker Hostel seems to be a great place. Shower sure felt good. Apparently, they can set me up with slack packs from here, roll be over to Ron Haven and they will deliver my big backpack. I may be able to go the rest of the way without carrying the ""monster"".

Papa T,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529686,"Started the day with a great breakfast at the Hiker Hostel. Slack packed today and it was a huge difference. Legs were still feeling yesterday a bit. Beautiful day without a cloud in the sky. Got pretty warm in the afternoon since the trees up here have not leafed out yet, then got cool waiting for the shuttle. About half way up Justus Mtn. a couple of warblers with brilliant yellow heads were having a territory dispute so close I could almost grab them. After Justus mountain the trail was much more tame all the way to Justus Creek.Ran into Wanda and Juice there. That was where they stopped last night. Made okay time to Gooch Mtn Shelter. There is no way in the world I would have made that far yesterday. ""Pops"" and Billy were there and just loading up. I stayed to have a little salami and cheese and water up. It seems to be a nice shelter. I reached Gooch Gap in pretty good shape and knew I had 3.5 more miles to go. It got a little more up and down and then more seriously up climbing Ramrock Mtn. At the top were some really beautiful views. I sat on a rock ledge for about 15 minutes, took some pictures and soaked it in. I thought the last 1.9 miles would be gentle downhill - wrong. There were a couple of nasty little climbs and it seemed forever until I made it to Woody Gap. Was on the trail at 9:30 and finished at 3:20. For me, not bad. I have become a walking billboard for the Hiker Hostel. Wanda and Susan are here tonight on my recommendation and they are getting off the trail like several others. Ricky and Pops tried to stay here but they are full tonight, but they will join us tomorrow here. On the Walmart run tonight I asked Leigh about the trail ahead. I asked if there was anything significant going south from Blood Mtn to Woody Gap. Other than one viewpoint it appears to be just more of the same. So, I may seriously consider altering plans and see about doing a ""highlight"" slack pack trip rather than grinding miles. I have had great shelter experiences, great hostel experiences and a healthy dose of the Georgia AT. More miles of the same seems sort of boring and tiring. I will look at my guidebook and plans tomorrow. Tomorrow is a zero day - No hiking. Need to rest up and take care of one blister. Tired tonight 8.8 miles in these mountains is serious for this 63 year old. Leigh said that mile for mile Georgia is second of all the AT states in elevation change. Only New Hampshire has more. Wow. My plan right now is simply a day hike up and down Blood Mtn starting at Neels Gap on Tuesday. Also want to see the famous Walasi Yi and Mountain Crossings.","Cooper Gap

Papa T,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529966,"Today was an up and back on one of the most infamous climbs on the AT - Blood Mountian. I think it is the highest point on the AT in Georgia. Roughly 1,000 ft of climb in less than a mile. Great day with partly cloudy skies a small breeze and temps in the 70's. It is a rugged hike and pretty steep near the top. You go through a section with lots of rock stairs and up over and through the rock formations. Near the top you are out on three separate granite sheet areas. The views are breathtaking while the trail takes your breath away. At the top is the famous Blood Mtn shelter, which is a stone building right at the top. They say the sunsets and sunrises up there are magnificent, and I believe it. It is also the oldest existing shelter on the whole AT. There is an extra little up and you sit on a rock face area with a virtual 360 degree view of the mountains. I stayed up there a while and ate lunch and just soaked it in. I could not make out a single man made structure in the entire view and could see all the way to Springer Mtn. I signed the shelter register and headed down. I almost lost the trail at one point and figured it out quick, but it was a little confusing coming over the rock slabs. Oh, and I almost forgot. On the way up I was alone and it was beautifully quiet. I was in a fairly open forest area with a slight uphill grade. I heard some rustling off to my right and as I turned around to see what it was, it turned out to be a pretty good size black bear hauling his butt up the hillside at a full gallop. It took a second for my brain to register that they don't have big black dogs running in the woods. The bear was probably about 120 lbs and not more than 40-50 yards behind me. Then he disappeared into the woods. It always seems longer when you are tired to get back to the trailhead. In this case, the trailhead is in one of the most famous landmarks on the entire AT - Walasi Yi / Mountain Crossings. I got to see the famous shoe tree, the arch through which the AT actually goes, and the actual Mountain Crossing Outfitters. I was tired, but not wasted today. Got picked up by the shuttle and am back at the fabulous Hiker Hostel. I love these guys.","Neels Gap

Papa T,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530164,"A little more cloudy today but still a nice day. The six miles were a bit tougher than I thought it would be. A long rise and fall to Bull Gap and then a short climb up Levelland Mountain. While I was taking a break to catch my breath I saw a couple scarlet tanagers with brilliant red heads and chests. Coming down Lewellen was steeper than I expected. My legs felt good when I woke up but were tight most of the day. I ran into my good buddy ""Pops"" at Wolf Laurel Top where we stopped and had snacks. The view from there was great and as we sat there we were blessed with a warbler show. They were over a dozen in the trees and bushes around us. He had a nice pair of binoculars and got to see a Golden Winged Warbler, a really beautiful little bird. One thing I have noticed is that unlike the northwest where you barely hear a bird in the woods, here the bird songs are constant all along the trail. The flowers are really popping out all over. There were several patches of about 1/2 an acre that were filled with blooming trilliums. I left before ""pops"" and made it next to Cow Rock which is an open rock slab area with more amazing views. I sat and ate a sandwich and just took it all in. ""Pops"" arrived about ten minutes later, so he was not far behind me at all and he showed me a picture of a good sized timber rattler than he had to move with his hiking stick. Yikes! Glad I missed that little episode. I called the shuttle from up at Cow Rock and then headed down the really steep last mile to the gap. My knees were letting me know they had been worked hard the last two days on the way down. They are fine but, like everybody out here, abused. I have already learned of two hikers whose hikes were cut very short by injured knees. The trails here are no joke rugged all the way. There is no place that is level for more than 50 yards. Then its either up a rocky trail, or down a rocky trail. You have to be so careful with every foot placement. Although I am tired, this really was another great day of hiking. Great views, beautiful wild flowers, new birds I have never seen before. At the gap I bid farewell to ""Pops"" and Billy Goat as they were headed up the trail. I really wish them the best and so enjoyed becoming friends with them. Tomorrow is a zero ""transit"" day. I am done with what I decided to do in Georgia and am moving north to a ""base camp"" in Franklin, NC. Good timing since there is a 90% chance of thunderstorms and maybe up to 3/4 of an inch of rain forcasted for tomorrow. No views tomorrow for the hikers.

The view is really fantastic. Another almost 360 view. There was a very high overcast but the air was really clear. I could even make out the fire tower on Albert Mtn and could see all the way to Clingmans Dome in the Smokies. Came down and one of those Golden Winged Warblers came within a few feet as I stayed still I headed down and the whole trail today was much easier than the others Lots of Towhees and Kingbirds. A couple of chipmunks were chasing each other and I stopped to watch. They were so into the chase the came within an inch of running over my shoe. I startled another later on and it climbed the trunk of the nearest tree about five feet away at my eye level. We just looked each other over for a bit. Flowers blooming all down the trail. Stopped at the shelter for a snack and met Wildman and Fabulous. Later met two ladies hiking with their Golden Retriever. Stopped briefly at Lickingsood Gap. You always know if there is a gap there is a climb ahead. At the top was a mountain view and the side was covered with white dots. Which were Dogwoods in full bloom.

I learned that Frogtown was in the Peace Corps for 2 years in Mongolia. We had a fun conversation sharing stories. Dan aka Wildman also was taking a zero because of foot issues. He broke all the bones in his left foot in a motorcycle accident and walks with a cane rather than a hiking pole. Just a really great down to earth guy from southern Indiana. I noticed that he had a full Bible in his backpack, always bows his head at meals with a silent prayer. He asked his mom to pray for him going over Albert Mtn. She replied that she always prays for him everyday. Sketch, also seems to be a quietly spiritual guy with a kind heart and gentle spirit. Sketch and I both were dozing and I was beginning to regret not hiking today, but about 2pm in came the showers. The hostel had just reset the modem and I was thinking of updating the journal when we got hit with some major thunderstorm activity. The sky was really popping with flashes every few seconds. Then, one hit the hostel. It popped those little circuit breakers on the plugs in the kitchen and Maggie said there were sparks coming from the modem. It got fried. The AT hikers really pass news along about the trail. There apparently is serious consideration that Katahdin may no longer be the northern terminus. Lots of usage issues and some conflict with Baxter State Park's stated primary mission of keeping it wilderness. Also, traditionally, you cross the Kennebec River in Maine in a canoe run everyday because the river level fluctuates dangerously and people have drowned trying to ford it. News is that they may discontinue the canoe because of the increased volume of hikers and replace it with a zipline that you hook your pack on, get in a seat and pull yourself across.

Saw a bald eagle just across the road and the crows were not happy at all. Steve drove Sketch and I up to the trail at Tellico Gap. You could see where the wild hogs had virtually plowed up part of a field rooting for food. I have heard that the ramps (kind of like an onion) are now in season. Sketch was looking for about a 20 mile day - yikes. He left me in the dust almost immediately. The climb up to Wesser Bald was about 1.4 miles of climbing but not too bad. My legs actually did fine. At the top there is a tower and, despite a little acrophobia, I climbed the stairs. The view was simply amazing. The air was clear and I could see forever. The peaks rising above a white blanket of low clouds in the valley. You had a complete 360 view and could see far into the Smokies. I had the tower all to myself and I had a snack, some water and just soaked in the scenery. Then I thought, ""I really wish my wife could see this."" I pulled out my iphone and had full coverage so I hit the facetime button and was able to share it live. How cool is that?! The drop from Wesser Bald down to the Nantahals Outdoor Center and the climb back out are two of the more notoriously tough sections of the AT. You go from 4618ft down to 1726ft, a drop of 2892f, in about 4 miles or so. The last part is a famous knee killer. I talked with the Steve, at the hostel and decided to take the Wesser Creek Trail down to its trailhead. It was reported to be almost the same drop (maybe 500 or so feet less) and a little shorter, but well engineered and the last mile along the stream. I hiked down from the tower about .8 miles to the Wesser Bald Shelter. Not a soul there. I signed the register and then found the cut off for the Wesser Creek Trail. Then the almost 3 mile jungle bushwhacking descent began. This trail has not been maintained at all since the fall. I was constantly using my poles to move foliage out of the way that was encroaching on the trail. I was also clearing the cobwebs, which meant I was the only person on that trail for awhile. Worse of all though were the dozens and dozens of blown down trees across the trail. I had to keep deciding do I go over this one, under that one, and how do I negotiate the short washed out sections. You didn't want to misstep because most of the hillsides, while not cliffs, were pretty steep. It was a Daniel Boone endurance test until the last half mile. The Wesser Creek trail may be about 500 ft less a drop in elevation, but you more than pay for it in other ways. The last section really was very pretty with the tumbling waters joining along the trail. Saw a number of Swallowtail Butterflies and another bunch of dark blue and black ones. I was lucky to get cell service right at the trailhead as Steve said I might have to walk down the road another mile to get it. My legs were not super tired, but my knees were really talking back to me. We picked up another hiker on the way back and the creeks are really running full after the last couple of days of rain. We also saw a Belted Kingfisher, a flock of goldfinches, and another bald eagle. Tomorrow will end my adventure on the AT for now.","Nantahala Mtn Lodge

Papa T,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531317,"I switched plans today. Originally. I was going to do about 6 miles and finish at Fontana. My knees were not up to that, and I found out that section is not particularly scenic. I have read so much about the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) that I decided to just do a short hike and have my cousin pick me up there. Easier on the knees, see something on my highlight list, a shorter drive to pick me up, and saving $50 in shuttle cost. Good decision. On the way, I learned that Steve's grandson goes to the local school that is pre-K through 12th grade and has about 130 students total. Wow. On the way to drop off another hiker we saw, what might have been some coyote puppies on the road. They were the right color, and size, and look, but we never saw the mom. If they weren't pure coyote they were certainly a feral canine mix with a lot of coyote in the blend. I was dropped off at NOC and I ran into Woody, who I met the first night at Stover Creek Shelter. I started up the AT going southbound for about 3/4 of a mile. Didn't want to go too far since my pick up said they might be here about noon or so. I got a little ways up the trail and I thought my heart would stop. About four feet away was a big thick snake about 5-6 feet long. I really thought is was a rattlesnake because the colors were right. I backed off and took a couple of pictures and noticed that it did not have any rattles. Still, I gave it a very wide berth. I found out from the folks at the outfitter that it was a banded water snake. Man, the trail out of NOC begins to climb almost immediately and steeply whether northbound or southbound. NOC is a really cool ""compound"" along the Nantahala River. It is a major kayak/canoe/rafting destination. 20 of its employees have been on the US Olympic kayak and canoe team, a couple of them the only 2 American gold medalists in the sport. They have all kinds of outdoor classes. It was fun to be in a place I have read about so many times and cross the bridge over the river. At 11am they release a higher volume of water from a dam upstream for the rafters, etc. Almost immediately you could see the river rise in front of you and become much more of a true white water river. I spent some time in the Outfitter store and on a bench by the river. My ride arrived and we had one of the AT famous burgers at the River's Edge restaurant - an AT tradition. Met several hikers and gave my guide page to a lady who didn't have one and was headed out. Every hiker was complaining of BKS - Battered Knee Syndrome. Just before we left I saw Melvin who was my bunkmate at the hostel last night. We wished each other well and it was time to go back to civilization. I plan to add a couple of post-hike entries in a couple of days when I am back home about the positives, negatives, what I learned, and a review of how the gear worked out. I also will load a bunch of the photos from the trip. For me this was all about experiencing the AT and all about the smiles, not the miles. It has been a terrific adventure and just a trove of lifelong memories. Go get' em fellow hikers and I will pray for you all and see you up the trail.","NOC

Papa T,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531866,"After a couple of R/R days I came home to an exuberant greeting by the pups. Glad to be home. Yet I think a piece of the trail is in the back of your mind always it never completely leaves you once it has been an experience, not just an abstract concept. You think about how the thru hikers are doing and wonder what the weather is on Blood Mountain. Thought I would recap a few positives and negatives. On the positive side the trail was a very special and social community with wonderful and interesting people The shelters were in good shape and I was not bothered by the mice. I did hear about mice running across tents and trying to get inside the flap. I got much better legs day by day especially up the ascents. I was fortunate to have nice days when there were views. I was lucky to see some cool wildlife and the wild flowers were almost constant along the trail. On the negative side the trail had much greater elevation change, was steeper and more rugged than I anticipated it's either up or down 98 percent of the time Really tough on the knees. Lots of relatively monotonous woods walking. After 3-4 days you get the idea. Logistics and resupply was more problematic in northern Georgia and N Carolina. There was a wide variety of hostels in quality and price Both the Hiker Hostel and Nantahala Mtn. Lodge were excellent   Tomorrow I will add some things I learned and will try to load some pix. I will also add an entry on how the equipment worked out","NOC

Papa T,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532113,"I loaded some photos from the adventure last night. Decided to review some things I learned on the trek. You can literally see the advance of Spring in the Appalachians. At 2000 feet trees are fully leafed out. At 4000 ft only buds. More wildflowers each day. A thru hike has a better chance of success if there is a burning motivation. The most dedicated folks were using the trail to work out a life crisis. Loss of a loved one, loss of job, etc. As St Jerome said, ""Solvitar ambulando"". To solve a problem, walk.   The trail is also easier with a hiking partner with a similar pace. Miles went by when walking and talking with Beach Bum or Pops. Many folks thought my style of backpack and day hikes while hitting the highlights was ideal. Pain and fatigue are an inescapable part of the deal especially at the beginning. It gets better as one works on two major variables- pack weight reduction and getting your trail legs. My precisely made daily plans and spreadsheet schedule went out the window almost immediately- learning- let the trail decide. I was so impressed how unselfish and giving trail folks are. Run out of fuel, use my stove I gave one guy extra water, my guide page that I no longer needed to a gal, people are always giving food away, and on it goes. Final lesson- stop and smell the roses. When I stopped to recover on a climb or get a drink and snack or just to stop for a view or bird was when I saw and appreciated more along the way. To do 20+ miles a day you have to really be moving on a trail that requires constant attention which means you can't see much more than your feet. In summary, enjoy the hike and let the trail come to you. As the saying goes- Its about the smiles not the miles. I will enter one more post to review how the gear performed.","Home

Papa T,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532299,When you are on the trail you are fully dependent on your gear. Here's how mine worked out. Jetboil Stove. Terrific Light weight Packs well Reliable Boils water super quick Osprey Aethher 70 Pack. Great design and fit. Weight distribution excellent. Took away to adjust to placement on zipper of top section. Everything fit inside with no dangling or lashed on items Osprey Daylite Day Pack. Only 1lb. Slides right into bit pack Has same sleeve for water bladder as big pack Big Agnes UL2 Tent. Easy to put up. Light. Roomy. Best of the options I saw Osprey Pack Cover Fit great Easy to put on. Really did its job on a really rainy day Columbia Convertible Pants Excellent. Durable Easy to turn into shorts. Dry quickly. Just don't rush the zipper Bro Air Xtherm Sleep Pad. Really comfy. Blew up easily Every one was envious Sea to Summit Aeros Pillow. Very comfy but slides around when you turn over. Packs into a tiny stuff sack Kelty Ignite Sleeping Bag. Warm and cozy on some cool rainy nights Sawyer Water Filter. Worked really well Almost standard on the trail. A little tricky to fill dirty water bag. It was efficient and quick enough Osprey 2.5L Water Bladder. Fits in pack in well designed sleeve. Two piece tube disconnected way too easily. Then you have to take whole pack off to fix. Once set it worked fine. Needs a little reengineeringMerrel Moab Shoes. Practically perfect. Comfortable Durable Waterproof. Fit almost right away with little break in. Every one who had them loved them tooLevi Corklite Poles. Once you figure out the tension adjustment on the locking clips they were superb. Many times I thought they would break but they stayed strong. A huge safety net for balance   They helped power uphill and saved my knees downhill. Don't leave home without them All in all equipment so much lighter and better than 20 years ago so get out there,"Post Hike
