Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522161,"Berk and I have been getting in shape for a thru-hike for some time. I enjoy a twice weekly group workout with some cross-fit alums. They really push me to my limits. And I take Berk to these classes for running as well, often with her full backpack and hiking boots. I also work out at home, although at a more leisurely pace. And I have put on a number of hours/miles on a treadmill at various inclinations. And we both enjoy hiking the hills at my ranch in west Texas.We recently had a dress rehearsal hike at Brazos Bend State Park. The hose to my 3L water bladder failed immediately and dumped all the water in my backpack. We hiked 7 miles in a half-day on Friday. Berkeley was “hunting” during most of the hike. I’m sure she could have caught a fat cottontail if I had let her loose. Thankfully, she didn’t try to take on one of the park alligators. We had a very enjoyable hike Saturday of 8 miles in full gear. I had planned another 2-mile slackpack hike, with Berk in her hiking boots. She much preferred this mode, but the trail was closed. My new Exped air mattress was great. It uses a snozzelbag to inflate the mat which is very efficient. Unfortunately, I forgot Berk’s sleeping pad and left it at the house. We did enjoy a sunset serenade from Horned Owls hooting.Overall, a very good dress rehearsal hike.",,Brazos Bend State Park (TX),"Feb 26, Fri",0
Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522832,"With respect to preparation, the good news is that I know what to expect, also the bad news is that I also know what to expect.Today was mostly final preparations for Berkeley. I got her a rain slicker (in pink, her favorite color to match her backpack) and a fleece jacket. Having forgotten her sleeping pad on our dress rehearsal hike, I now have it packed under my groundcloth around my tent. I spent much of today vacuum packing her food. She will be eating a puppy chicken/rice blend with over 500 kcals/cup.   She already had her hiking boots and food/water containers. And she got a final checkup from the vet before we left: all shots up to date, flea/tick/heartworm Rxs, as well as doggy antibiotics. Don't have anything for snakebites though.Yesterday was a start for carbo loading, another name for the youngest granddarling's 7th birthday celebration. We started out with ""7"" pancakes and then had a party at Dave & Buster's. She selected a cake that was very heavy in the icing department. a good time was had by all.",,"Greenville, SC","Feb 27, Sat",0
Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522874,"Its getting closer...   I was thinking about starting my hike this year on Sunday, March 13th. However, I may slip this a day depending on the rain forecast.   I know we'll get our share of rain somewhere on the trail; I just don't want to start out with Berkeley in rain if I can avoid it.I think I've finally got my journals on this site figured out. After completing my hike in 2010, I added a couple of entries of a winter photo workshop at Yellowstone NP (remarkable for a neg 45 deg temperature!) I thought these were going to be posted in a separate journal, but learned these entries were appended to my AT entries. The ""ghost"" journal (Other Trails 2011) has now been deactivated. And I notice my ""Guest Book"" contains all entries. My original journal was quite a production. I almost always had a ""word of the day"", ""song of the day"", and ""person of the day"". I also had great transcription support from Ground Control. This journal will not be such a production. I'll be mostly using my Iphone on the trail when I have battery power and cell service. Town stops will be influenced by internet access and ""free time"".",,"Greenville, SC","Mar 06, Sun",0

Monday is a bit better, but its looking more and more likely that Tuesday the 15th will be our departure date.I was asked if I had a trail name for Berkeley. I haven’t thought about that yet. When I “adopted” Berkeley from her “foster parents”, the family made a request that I keep her name Berkeley. No problems, sure. However, I need a crisper name for voice training commands and truncated her call to Berk. One AT hiker alum I have communicated with had named his dog Aramis, the Hairy Missile. So, we’ll see if she gets a trail name.Speaking of Berk, her participation will significantly impact my planning. I will use a special diet for her and will have to use mail drops for her re-supply needs. I have the 1st 250 miles covered; but won’t know if my planning is successful until we get out on the trail for a while. Once I get comforable with her needs and my planning, I’ll post my mail drops with the gratuitous “yogi’ing” for treats.",,"Greenville, SC","Mar 10, Thu",0
Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523639,"1st day is in the books. Got up early in Greenville and said farewell to Libra Lady. B2 drove Berk and I to the Springer Mtn parking lot. We took a quick slack pack to the summit to sign the register and then returned to the parking lot to get all our gear. I passed more than a dozen on my summit walk and doubt that 1/3 will hike past Neels Gap. We left the lot about 1230 and made good time stopped about every hour for water and rest break. Berk was very good but she started yogying for pets I think she would roll over on her back for belly rubs if she wasn't carrying her own backpack. She was showing a tender pad and I carried most of her weight. She favored it a little at first but then went into her hunt mode and forgot about her foot. We were approached by several loose small dogs that were supposedly friendly. However, they became aggressive once near Berk. We passed the Stover Creek Shelter at 3 miles and a good group was camped out. I met a Ridge Runner at some new campsites justS of the Hawk Mtn Shelter (8 mi). We talked a bit, he reported he was going to bethe only one at Hawk Mtn, and I thanked him for the service. I planned to stop at Hawk Mtn for food, water, hygeine and rest break. When I arrived, it looked like Tent City. There were over a dozen tents and 2 dogs. It was about evenly split between 1st and 2nd nighters on the trail. We leapfrogged a young couple on a day hike passed one guy in trail who probably won't make the next shelter and another might if he's lucky. They said that we're ok and didn't need any help. I had planned to hike on to Sassafras Mtn at 11.5 miles. However, my legs started complaining at 9 miles. I went another mile and saw a perfect campsite calling my name and decided to call it a day at 10 miles. And I think at least 9 of those miles today we're all uphill. Tents up, bear bag hoisted and sun is down...Hikers MidnightWe're going to bed.Life is good!","Springer Mtn

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523747,"For new readers: hikers have their own language and names. WhiteBlaze has a glossary on their website. B2 is my son, Libra Lady my wife, and the granddarlings are PP1 and PP2Yesterday adds:After adopting Berk, I get obedience training with her in German Language commands. She did very well on leash and in controlled environments. However, off leash her feral hunting instincts took over. These were so strong that I gave up trying to overcome them as it would have resulted in a less happy dog. Then last year I took her hiking section of the CDT and learned I needed hiking commands. I didn't have German skills so used English, the most used was ""Hike On"" for her to lead out to end of her cable. She picked this quickly. Now back to yesterday, we were on the approach trail to Springer Mtn and had to stop as 3 BBW had blocked the trail. They noticed and cleared a path for us to pass. I gave a hearty Hike On and was met with evil looks. I explained it was a command for the dog and one replied she thought I was telling them to move their big fat a$$e$ up the hill. And she was never to good with Haw and Gee and looked at me like she wasn't a mule. I now have received German commands for our hikeAnother yesterday. Met an Army Ranger at one of the gaps. The Rangers have an outpost down one of the hills. When I was SoBo in 2010 I remember Blackhawk helicopters flying at night below my campsiteToday was a hard 10.8. After 10 yesterday in little German half day, I was expecting a lot more. But we had an early 700' climb followed by a 300' climb which was mostly vertical. I don't think the first 7 miles had 1/4 mile of flat terrainBerk is doing great. Still yogying for pets. She is very good about doing her potty business off the trail. When she does cross dog or coyote scat she does leave her mark as Queen of the trail. We did cows some bear scat and Berk went into serious hunt mode. I had to poke her haunches to get her to move. But she is enjoying herself, still quite a bit in the hunt modeTomorrow could be another tough day or I may decide to take it easy. We'll seeLife is good.","near Horse Gap

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523851,"Only 8.5 miles today but I'll take. There was a morning wake up climb of 500 ft and an afternoon climb of 1900 ft. We're staying at Blood Mtn shelter tonite. Should have tried another couple of miles to Neels Gap but we were bushed. We got a late start this am. I slept in late and was slow gearing up. Then when I was loading my backpack I thought I saw a tent pole repair sleeve which wasn't where it supposed to be. Turned out my pack strut came loose and I had a time getting it reinstalled properly Berk is doing good on hydrating at streams. Our vet said she be drinking filtered water but that's not very practical out here. Berk has learned to did a hole where the streams are very shallow to pool up the running water. She still yogying for pets at all stopsSaw some trail maintainers working this am. Early Bird caught up with me and then I leapfrogged here. So several young hikers at a stream a mile short of Blood Mtn. There was a blue blaze trail for campsites and water, but it was a hard .4 miles downhill. I was considering just camping near the stream and as the youngsters were leaving I asked them to shout out if they saw a flat spot to camp. I didn't hear anything and was .4 up to a trail crossing and another .4 up to the shelter. I cooked dinner and fed Berk and was going to the trail crossing to look for a camping spot and if I felt good slug it on up to the shelter. I didn't go 100 yards and found an official campsite and there were another 1/2 dozen or so just beyond. It wasn't very well marked and I accidentally got off the AT a bit in the campsites. I easily made the trail crossing and there was no camping areas. I decided to press on as the trails usually get much less inclined as you approach the summitWe're fed, tired and Berk is already snoring. Hikers midnight... Going to bedLife is good!","Woody Gap

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524444,"Berk and I were the only ones in the Blood Mtn shelter last night. We had some excitement around midnight when two hikers with I think a young Great Dane hiked thru. Berk was on duty!I'm glad I didn't try to make Neels Gap yesterday. The trail up was mostly rock steps, good for knee workout. The trail down was more technical, with lots of bald rocks. Berk even had a couple of challenges and she has 4 paw drive.I got to Neels Gap and picked up my 1st drop box. Neither Berk or I have our trail appetites yet one good thing about going to a drop or town is that your pack is at its lightest weight and it's usually all down hill. Conversely, leaving is almost always uphill with max pack weight. About Neels Gap, the rule of thumb is that about 1/4 of the starters will drop out by now. And it's reported that a few will even decide to quit on the approach trail to Springer.We rested up a bit at Neels Gap and then headed N. I met 3 Amigos ( no names yet) with a nice Boxer pup. And we were met by a loose ""friendly"" Husky that approached with hacked up, tail down and growling. He became friendly again after a hiking pole in the ribsOn the trail I saw a lot of trash and had some unkind thoughts for the hiker. A little bit later I saw what looked like maybe a bear had found someone's food bag. Still, the hiker should have cleaned up the messWater sources are dictating a lot of the hike. I thought I had missed one but found an alternate. It was late in the afternoon and I thought I could carry on to the next source at 4 miles this section was the first that had what I would call switchbacks and we were blazing, covering this in a little over 1 1/2 hours.We got to the water at a road crossing. Stopped and fixed dinner. RC, a local showed up on a bit Harley and asked if I needed anything. USAF no at first and the asked if he would take one of Berks feed sacks. Neither she nor I have trail appetites we talked a bit, he's a7 generation county boyI wanted to hike up and camp on the next Mtn top or the next gap. The former was only 1/2 mile and latter another 1/2 mile. This leg almost did me in. I was huffing and puffing the whole way up the Mtn and decided to bed down at the first good looking camping site. I checked by guidebook and saw that this was 500' climb...something less than a 20% grade!!!It's supposed to start raining and get cold soon.

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524080,"X Rocky Knob11.4Wow...what a day. After posting entry last nite I checked the wx forecast. It was rain starting at 0600 and lasting all day. So, I was strongly considering a zero. I got up around 0700 and was overcast. Around 0900 I decided I could make the next shelter at 5 miles and settle down there. I was making good to rand was there just after noon. I decided to take a power nap but it soon got cold and windy. I wrapped up in ground cloth and tried to sleep. Then it started misting, more overcast and I set up tent and Berk and I laid down. After an hour it clears up and got hotter. I saw a lot of hikers on the trail today and Early Bird and Victory came in to bed down at shelter campground I planned to hike up to the next stream at 3 miles, eat and water up and then press on to camp at next trail crossing. I passed several small dreams that weren't very interesting and came to one at what I thought was the right mileage. There was a another hiking blazing thru and I asked him f he thought this was stream at the gap. He said he was on autopilot and didn't know. So on I pressed. I was getting tired and found the trail crossing signs, having missed the stream. Press's on another 1 1/2 miles and reached the Rocky Knob campsite and decided to call it a day. I went to get water which was a pain. Majestic War Eagle, Woodchuck and Swamp Donkey were in camp. MWE offered Berk some pork tenderloin scraps which I added to her food and she was a happy dog It's getting cooler, rain is supposed to stay away for several more days. I got another mail drop in20 miles and will probably take a zero thereLife is good!","Wildcat Mtn

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524210,"I didn't have cell coverage last nite and earlier noticed that some entries went awry. I'll try to clean this at next hostel stop in day or two. My strategic plan is gone at Mt Katahdin ME before end of Sept. My tactical plan is my next resupply. And my daily plan is to not miss my resupply point. I got a late start this am. Just Pete stopped by the camp and several hikers passed as well. I had good farewell with overnight campers and was on my way to Unicoi Gap, a 2 1/2 mile hike with big 1K ft descent at the end. There were more technical sections, if fact Berk had the 1st official fall and the cable kept her from rolling down the hill. Just before Unicoi I met a coed teenage group of hikers that were being challenged , especially one gal I gave her an encouraging word and when I passed the leader at the end I mentioned she would need a lot of assistance/motivation to reach the topWe got the Unicoi around noon and Praise the Lord. The Taylor Foundation put out the best trail magic in memory of service member hikers. There was cheeseburgers, hot dogs, pizza, homemade Cole slaw, potato salad, chips. Then on the lighter side were donuts, cookies, coffee and juice ( No offense MWE but your coffee this am was severely lacking) And everyone seemed to love Berk. Now for the bad news... It was a 1100 ft climb out of the gap!! We made good time and I was getting concerned about our water. The next water hole was a FS road crossing, straight out of the pipe. Berk then gave her ""horse running to the barn"" move and raced to the road. We met a lot of hikers there and Berk got a lot of pets. There were several blue blazes, a named trail and a parking lot, but no visible water. I started hiking down one of the blue blazes and met a day hiking couple who reported water was about a mile down the trail. I met some other hikers with a dog and asked if they knew where the water pipe was. They didn't know either but gave me a liter and half as they were leaving. I hiked another mile and came to the referenced site with water. The prior, more identifiable road crossing wasn't even on the map.  We camelled up and started a 1200 ft climb. It started a light snow/hail.   We made the Tray Mtn shelter before 1800 and pitched the tent in a driving snow/ hail shower. I fixed dinner but Berk got cold and didn't eat. I have her in a sweater and may put Ina 2 new as well. Me, I'm in my wool shirt, down sweater and getting ready to climb into my sleeping bagLife is good!","Rocky Knob

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524353,"Last night was one for the books!! It was getting cold, still late snow/hail and wind blowing sideways. There were 1/2 dozen youngsters camping nearby and had a small fire going. I joined briefly and then went to bed. I closed my tent vents to keep the white stuff out. The wind howled all night. My feet were cold and Berk was shivering most of the night. I had a fleece vest on her, covered her with her insulated rain jacket and tried to get her to sleep on her dog pad. She wouldn't stay on her pad and got cold soaked from the ground. If the middle of the night I traded my down jacket I use as a pillow and used it to cover her up. Eventually she warmed up a bit. We all got up late and what a surprise to see the ground almost covered in the white stuff. My inside water bottle was mostly frozen and Berks water bowl and my water bladder frozen solid. One of the guys terms gauge was reading 14 set The youngsters were having a little trouble getting a fire started... Usual no tinder all kindling. I went and found a bunch of dried out hollow stems and returned just as they had a small ignition. But, soon we had a small fire going. I was last to pitch camp and leave. My day plan was to take a ""light"" day today and nero at a hostel tomorrow. It was mostly excellent hiking weather: cool and dry but a bit windy. I had my first official fall, slipped on some mud. Noticed another hiker had the same issue a few feet down the trail. I trying something new to me in all my camping experience. I try to take an early afternoon rest stop and power nap. Then have dinner late afternoon and then hike some more after that. It's working out very well so far. We're bed down for the night already. Berk is already asleep.

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524463,"Journal comment: got some computer access and was able to clean up some of my journal entries. Discovered my Wildcat Mtn entry didn't get posted. Corrected some of the erroneous dates. and was able to download an app on my Iphone to upload some pictures.Tray Mtn shelter updates; got a 2nd confirmation of 14 deg low temps for the night. One of the youngsters camping in a hammock tent had the wind blow over an aluminum tent peg into a 90 deg turn. His guyline wouldn't secure so he ended up in shelter for the rest of the night.   Then as part of my morning predeparture routine, I went to to a log around the campfire to put on my boots, check the map one last time, and then headem up and move on. Only today, i made a call to reserve a room at top of GA and they wanted a credit card deposit. so over to my pack to retreive my cc info. All done, loaded up and moved on. After a short whilem, i noticed my glasses and map were missing.   Back to the campfire to collect my valuables.Today was an absolute 10. an early departure and short 2.5 mile hike to Dick's Creek Gap. there were the ""sirens"" putting out trail magic. hot dogs and drinks. I was getting ready for a 1/2 mile hike to the hostel when their shuttle bus arrived. I got all checked in, hot bath and laundry load done. I weighed my pack at Unicoi Gap and found a disturbing 42 lbs. So, part of today was shedding serious weight. In the afternoon I took the shuttle into town, mailed 6#s to B2, had a wonderful rib dinner, baked beans, onion rings and garlic toast. Then made a very quick resupply run at grocery stroe to catch the next shuttle out. Saw Just Pete in the store and we barely recognized each other; sorry I didn't have more time to socialize. I fed Berkeley and gave her some attention. Time now to mellow out and relax the rest of the day. tomorrow is serious hiking again.Life is Good!","Vista Blue Blaze

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524718,"Yesterday evening was interesting. There was a presentation by a couple of youngsters on Leave No Trace. It was quite informative, learned a bit, and when I went to find them to complement their presentation, they had Left...Without aTrace. Then there was a large group that had a campfire and guitar music. Then later the owner Bob, Sir PacksALot arrived and gave a thru hiking presentation. He confirmed my fears that there is no easy way to erect my tent in the rain other than trying to be quick. I had a hard time going to sleep, must have been past 0130, got up for potty break at 0500 and Berk was ready to start hiking. We had spent the night in the Wolf Den at TOG hostel, with 1/2 dozen other hikers and another dogMorning continental breakfast was awesome: pan sausage biscuit, link sausage biscuit, pineapple mango scone, better biscuit with honey, and some cinnamon crumb cake with coffee. There were other homemade pastries as well but I haven't got my hiker appetite yetMy primary objective at today's start was to significantly reduce my pack weight. I had mailed 6#s home to B2 yesterday. And this am I gave Berk her first full pack weight. Previously I carried her food and let her carry about 3-4#s of water and snacks. Today she carried her full rations: 6#s. My pack felt considerably lighter but still pegged the scales at a whopping 48#s. My tactical plan was to complete my 2nd half of a neon to equal one zero. So I didn't even check my map because I had no real plans other than an easy hike. (Note to self: Don't try this stunt again!). I won't say I've got my trail legs yet, but I really felt strong this am. I didn't have any rest breaks in the am and finally forced myself to stop after 2 hrs to eat and drinks. Beams thing for the next 2 hours. I did try to make it to the GA-NC border, but was starting to watch Berk labor a bit. We came upon the border just after our break and then had another water refill shortly after that. There was a pipe with clear water flowing and when I filled Berk's water bowl it was filled with trash. I looked at the other end of the pipe and wished I could unsee what I had just seen. I then filled my water bottle and the next point of interest was the Bly Gap Oak tree where we took pix. Oh, did I say we already climbed over 1000'and the next 1.3 Mi had a 900 ft climb. There were times when it seemed the trail was only about a foot from your face. Berk started to fade noticeably in mid afternoon. I started taking longer breaks just for her. I had hoped to stop at a piped spring just short of the shelter, eat, camel up and then hike on past the shelter But the spring was no where to be seen.   So we hiked on to the shelter with probably a couple of dozen of other hikers. Saw many I had seen before: Silent Bob, Crooked Foot, Ungawa a few others who don't have trail names yet. Berk started to perk up a bit later in the afternoon. I fed and watered her when we stopped at the shelter and she ate full rations. She also got her share of pets and then went to sleep.","Top of GA Hostel

It was almost 13 miles and mostly downhill. I got all my gear stowed,had a quick breakfast and was out hiking shortly after0800. We had an early 1k' climb to Standing Indian Summit. This was a relatively easy climb with numerous switchbacks along the way. We were making good time up until the last 3 miles when I started to fade badly.

It had started to rain as I was about to eat and got everything real wet. I made a water run during one of the breaks and bed down early for a very restless night. Muscles were really complaining. I was doubly motivated to get to the gap to catch the shuttle into town. One, I wanted to be at an Easter service Sunday. Second, my RA doc and I have an agreement that I can have two beers on Sat and Sunday. So I called the motel before I started hiking this am to book a reservation for the weekend. I got a kinda, sorta, maybe we might oughta have a room for you and Berk if you get in early before we sell out....The first part of the hike was quite relaxing. Berk was in full hunt mode, saw a squirrel in a tree and left the trail to pursue. She went off the trail and there was a 500' drop off which would really upset me if she pulled me down with her. Fortunately the cable prevented her falling further. Official fall score: Berk 2, Tic 1. We had a very nice challenge getting up Albert Mtn. Very steep, most technical section to date. Even Berk was having some challenges. At the top, Berk found a puddle of water and laid down in it. But we were flying after that. Stopped at 1st shelter for a water break and then soon came to the 2nd shelter. I planned to stop there for the nite but decided to press on based on my motel "" reservation""   There was water at the next gap but 0.7 mi off the trail. There was water at the next further gap less than a mile uphill. I passed the 1st and upon arriving at the 2nd could find no water. I thought about the options which weren't very promising: retreat or press further a number of miles. But this gap was at a highway crossing and I managed to yogy 3'bottles of water from my new best favorite trail Angels E&G. I had been hiking the past several days with Dolce Girl, Ungawa, Larry Bird and several others w/o names yet    Dolce Girl came up at the gap and was likewise in short supply of water and was able to yogy some water as well. We both wanted to get close to the shuttle gap so we decided to press on further up the hill again. We didn't go 200 yds and found a very large stream. We kept on hiking and made it all the way to Winding Stair well before dark. We tented up for the night and DG found her car was parked at the gap ( too long on a story here).

She said she got up at 0730 and took an hour to pack up. OK, sounds like a comfortable start today. I got up just after 0700 and DG was gone. I packed up and was getting ready to head to the parking lot when DG showed up, said she got cold and went to the car to warm up. She also said she tried to wake me but nothing doing. We were first to check into the motel and of course my "" reservation"" wasn't recorded. In fact, they had already sold out all the rooms by 1100. It was old home week in town: Lobo, Ungawa, City Slicker, Count, Patches, Doc, Silent Bob, Kicker and several others I don't recall now. A very pleasant surprise was seeing AT legend Baltimore Jack. He had helped me out in 2009 when I had to be air evac'ed out by M&M airways for some LL health issues. Then when I returned in 2010 I met BJ at Kincora'sI got showered, laundry done, gear cleaned up and aired out. Had nice chat with with LL and went into downtown to get her a card.   Got organized and started planning my next section. Tried to print my GSMNP pass but the federal website was down.   I can't take Berk into GSMNP so was coordinating her pickup with B2    Also planned an opportunity to meet with the PPs if we could make Berk's handoff on Sat.   So, the new tact plan is to meet at Fontana Dam on Sat, play with the PPs a bit, handoff Berk and then start the Smokies.

I had checked out the place earlier and was impressed by their beer list, the fact that dogs were allowed on their patio, and their burgers looked divine. I ordered a very nice stout was presented a second glass as an overpour. For entree choices, I was hard to choose from about 6 choices, until I saw the waitress serve a prime rib to next table. It was delicious!! Dulcigal and I made a slight resupply run to Dollar General and I bought my 2 nd of 2 beers I'm allowed on Sat ( free ones don't count!) and some microwave popcorn.

My next increment planning horizon was meeting B2 in Fontana for a Berk transfer on Sat, about 60 mi NOBO. Thus, a fairly comfortable week ahead, Sun wx forecast was rain and a good reason for a 2nd zeroI was up with rest of the biker trash at Ron Haven's Budget Inn for morning breakfast at the Baptist Church. There I meet two other UT thru hikers: Chaos and Bevo. I then went to a most spiritual contemporary service at the Methodist Church and another brunch. On the hike back to the motel I passed up on the Presbyterian brunch from the city sunrise service. I talked to the manager from the Bowery, where I had the outstanding dinner the nite before and put their afternoon Easter brunch on my 1400 appointment. I was chilling out at the motel when there was a call at the1100 shuttle if I wanted to slackpack. Next thing I know Berk and I are with Dulcigal at the Windingstair Gap. There I also saw Just Peter, Ungawa and PlainKate. DG, Berkand I Started NOBO with just day packs. Along the way we found Easter eggs with Dove dark chocolates. We easily cruised 10 miles in a dreary, misty fog and arrived at the Wayah Bald watch tower. There were 4 other slack packers who started 2 miles behind us. The taste quite younger answer expected them to easily catchup with us. We called the motel to tell them we arrived at the designated pickup point and the shuttle was dispatched to pick us up it began to get cool, windy and misty and I was starting to get cold. Another pair of thruhikers were being supported by a ground team and we were given hot chocolate. Thank you thank you!!! The shuttle soon arrived Annan hour later we were back at the motel. I bought my weekly beer ration, ordered a pizza and got my clothes cleaned and dried. Later tonite maybe Berk will beta shower as well. I'm tired and going to bedLife is Good!","Havens Budget Inn

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525214,"Wesser Bald Shelter11.5Last night was another restless night. Legs are still barking most all night and my brain doesn't want to turn itself off. I thought the Baptist breakfast shuttle left at 0730; but the actual departure time was 0715. I missed the last bus but it was an easy walk. Great breakfast, photos and cards home. I went back to the motel and the number one action was to arrange our return to our slackpack point, about 45 mins away by car. The motel owner, Ron Haven said he would drive us after one of his scheduled shuttles. I then started trying to make arrangements for Nantahala Outdoor Center and then slack packing after NOC. This was more of a challenge because of Berk's participation, but I finally got it organized: a 4 bunk cabin at NOC and a slackpack to a B&B at Stecoah Gap. About that time, Ron showed up and drove us to the Wayah Bald tower and gave us a local history lesson along the way. The wx was perfect when we arrived at the tower and one could see for 60 miles. I was hiking with Dulcigal and Just Pete ( maybe Candyman) was slack packing and joined us for awhile. After our first shelter, Berk found one of her favorite hugging buddies lying along the trail and proceeded to give him a good playtime. Turned out it was Scavenger who had been very ill the night before. He was trying to rest up a bit and then return to the shelter 100 yds back he said he could make it and would call Ron for help if he needed it. Pete stopped for his shuttle pickup and indicated he might like to take one of my 4 bunks, and DG already had spoke for another. We made very good time to a FS road, another 800' climb that seemed to go on forever and came to another watch tower with beautiful views. Less than a mile to the shelter and we were done with hiking for the day. Tent pitched, dinner finished ( Berk is beginning to acquire her trail appetite) journal entry written and now bedtime. The shelter area is filled with many I had seen previously: the ""kids"" from the frozen mtn, a couple from the Franklin bookstore and several others I done remember seeing before.

Had some oatmeal, granola and mocha for breakfast. Then started a very easy, mostly downhill climb to NOC. Some trees are beginning to bud and saw a few flowers. Air was clear and offered numerous wonderful sights. We took a rest break at the last shelter this am and Berk od'ed on pets from Patches and Yosamite. Checked into the NOC and my cabin is the farthest one away, with a good 200' climb. And, only one door down from my stay here in 2010. DG, Candyman and Tim are sharing my bunkhouse. Arrangements made for slack packing to B&B tomorrow. ""Got"" my Smokies pass finally. The fed pay site as down for 2 days in Franklin and not taking reservations.

Personal Entry: It was over 51 years ago I met LL at my apt at UT-Austin and today marks our 47th wedding anniversary. It is often said that the toughest job in the military is that of the military spouse. LL had started a promising professional career and gave that up to support me in my career and be a stay-at-home Mom to raise our son. My military career was essentially tame: 4 moves, half dozen major TDYs and several hundred short TDYs. And the challenge was often the same: ""Honey, I've got to go; I don't know when I'll be back; take care of the kid, the dogs, the house, the car, the bills and anything else I left open. I'll call when I can. Love you! Bye!"" She has always supported me in all my efforts and continues to do so today. So, thank you LL for a wonderful 47 years and here is to many.Honey, I've got to go; I don't know when I'll be back; take care of the kid, the dogs, the house, the car, the bills and anything else I left open.

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525590,"I slept pretty good Tue night. THere were 4 of us, plus Berk, sharing a bunkhouse: DG, Just Pete, Rob and I. JP left early and the 3 of us went to the restaurant for a very hearty breakfast and stow our packs for some slack packing today. We breezed up a 3300' Mtn which was quite easy in slackpack mode. Took a few nice pix. Took a short water and snack break at the Sassafras Shelter. Then had some excitement. After cresting a ridge, I noticed a blazing fire 2 ridges over. The wind was light, but blowing our way. I kicked my pace up quite a bit, not knowing whether I was racing towards or away from the fire. I had another short climb ahead and then a long downhill which is where I thought I should be going.   At the top of the ridge, I met a forest ranger, who said we were safe, but that they had closed a crossing trail. At our last Mtn top before the Stecoah Gap I called Robin at Buffalo Creek B&B we would be ready for pickup. I had hoped to stay at the Cabin in the Woods for this stop. I had stayed there in my 2010 hike and really enjoyed it then, but they were not allowing dogs. That said, I really enjoyed BC B&B. Rob and Robin were great hosts, their log cabin home is most comfortable and I had my best sleep yet: nice bed and a flowing stream outside And the highlight was relaxing in the hot tub when I saw the International Space Station pass overhead, followed shortly by most likely a Progress resupply ship. I spent a lot of time woo the ISS: SIG Space working group that led to Pres Reagan approving a space station, the SS Task Force at NASA HQ ( I was an USAF detailee to NASA, which I regarded as a POW,with absolutely no disrespect to the real POWs), then as a NASA person at HQ I had minor relationship with SS Freedom and later Dep Dir for Shuttle Mir which became Phase 1 of the International Space Station, evolving into the ISS, and then a transfer to Johnson Space Center where I completed my space career in the ISS Program Office...whew!Today should be another great slackpack. Rain was forecast. The power company was doing some work near the B&B. Power was out for most of the day and restored just before we arrived. But a big pain was that they took out phone and Internet. Also, short talk to B2 about picking up Berk indicates some serious adjustment to my near term plans. And I should be starting in the Smokies Friday current forecast is that battery power and Internet access might be at a premium for the next week or so and postings might be silent for awhileLife is Good!","NOC

I slept very well but was up at 0600 and went down to have coffee with the Mason's. Put Berk out for food and water and we had an excellent breakfast. On return to the trail, we stopped in town to print out Smokies permit. We were slack packing from Stecoah Gap before 0900. After short while caught up with Just Pete/ Candyman. We pressed on and we're making good time. But,major toy after noon the rains came hard and made the trail very slippery. I slipped numerous times and fell twice, with a little assistance from Berk as she was pulling on her cable all the time. We got to the marina parking lot and wet waiting for B2 who had picked up our packs at the B&B. He wasn't at the lot when we arrived and DG and Rob pressed on to the Hilton. Berk started to get cold and I put her in the restroom at the marina. B2 arrived and we went to an upper parking lot. I carried their packs to the Hilton and then B2 took Berkand I to the village. I needed another fuel canister and was going to buy some pizzas for the hikers at the Hilton. I was at the PitStop at 5:01 ( with two others), but they closest 5:00 and weren't interested at all in serving customers. Back to the parking lot where I resupplied food and clothing.

We caught the shuttle immediately and were at the lodge restaurant by 0900. 30 minutes later our order was taken and was served in another 20 mins. I left nasty gram for the resort mgr. I was back at the shelter getting ready for a short, but challenging hike. Purple Yum Yum left ahead of me but I didn't see her. She came back in about 10 mins having started the wrong way. I soon crossed the dam, officially entered the GSMNP, and deposited my permit. It was a 6 mile, 2100' climb. Climbed another fire tower at Shuckstack, that was quite windy and in generally poor repair. I was slamming water heavily and stopped at a very slow spring. Took me about 20 minutes to collect 2 liters. The ""real"" stream was ahead 1/2 mile, but that would have required about 10 mins for 2 liters. I got to the campsite early and there were three others there. Another seven and counting showed up after me. I had dinner and stowed my food bag on the bear cables. Because you are required to stay at the shelters ( this campsite is the only one on theAT), I left my tent with B2 and am cowboy camping. Hope that was a good decision.

The wx forecast called for 21 set low with strong winds. I decided for max cold and was starting to place my liner inside my 10+ yr old 20 set bag. Opened up the bag and it was an extra pack rain cover... Then I remembered my liner is in my summer bag in my resupply box   Plan B was long johns, wool shirt, onesie tyvek coverall and down sweater. I was too hot and had to shed the sweater during the night. The 3 Tenn college boys were called out by Outback for cleaning dishes at the fire ring and I got into them for leaving the fire going all night. I went out for a nature call and burning embers were blowing all over the hillsideThis was a tough day. I don't know that it got to 21, but it was well below 30. DG gave me some freeze dried scrambled eggs and bacon and it was the worse I've ever had. I fixed some mocha and started out before 0900. It was brutally cold with howling winds. My hands and fingers were numb and I had to stop about ever 10-15 mins to place my hands under my armpits to keep from getting frostbite. It was 6.3 miles to the 1st shelter, which was very tough considering it was a net drop of 20'. Oh, and in between was a 600 and a 500' climb. The next 7.5 miles were relative easy. I leapfrogged all day with Outback and all we saw on the trail were 4 SOBOs. We arrived at the shelter at about 1800 and there were about 6 there already, including Blueberry Yum Yum.

However, the website is flagging some emails as invalid and I'm unable to respond to these.Catch-up info: I've been straddling the NC-TN border for some time now (Note to JSC COD: NC water is better!) I've been seeing genko birds for some time now and just recently a few robins. Saw a hog trap near the trail. And at Siler's Bald Shelter, I thought of MJ (recent birthday and said a short RIP prayer for her brothers and parents)There were about 8 hikers in the shelter last night and I;ll give BBYY the benefit of the doubt and state that there 7 very heavy snorers. Outback started outside but said wind was too strong and came into the shelter. He also reported that several people were out for nature calls during the night and I told him that was me.   We were all early, even BBYY, and hiking towards Clingman's Dome, the highest point on the AT. I think it was a 1000' ft climb but it didn't seem to stress me at all. got to the dome and took yhe requisite photos. Just past the dome, I passed the 200 mile mark, which i consider the length to consider myself a thru-hiker this year.   I leap frogged with Outback and Grumpy the rest of the way to New Found Gap and then decided to take some typical trail photos for my vicarious hiking partners. The hike onto New Found Gap was more of a challenge than I expected. Afterall, wasn't it all supposed to be downhill from the Dome?

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526560,"Today was a ""zero"" day. Spent 5 hours and 6 shuttles to get to Wal Mart in Seviersville to get my watchband replaced. Back in G'burg, updatying log, last minute resupply, dinner tonite and then early bed for tomorrow.physical fitness - My fitness for this hike was a major concern.   JSC has an outstanding OSH program and their dertailed fitness logs confirmed my fitness level was decreasing in an non-linear rate compared to age. I then joined a bootcamp invite from Hardcore and Sarge Shannon's mantra was along the lines that if you're not improving, you're losing. That has now evolved to an ad hoc group that meets 2x a week for exercises. i really credit this group for pushing my fitness level. i will admit to shutting it down when dizzyness is nearing, I'll take an occasional senior citized discount on some of the reps, I don't do many burpees these days, i doubt that I can run a mile and for sure I can't complete a tabata sprint workout. I have complained to my PCP and she has checked me out and her only diagnosis is TMBs. but I can hike me some AT mountains.So, let me suggest a workout to emulate a typical (hard) day hiking at Beak's Gym in the Gilruth. The scenario is a 10-12 mile hike with a typical 1500' (hard 3000') climb at the start. Now in the AT, my experience is that you will give back 50% of everything you climb, e.g., a 1500' (3000') climb is more likely to be 2250"" (4500'). Using mountain math, 6 miles is 30000+ feet, divided into 1500 (3000) is a 5% (10%) incline. So, set the treadmill at 5% (10%), strap a 40# kettlebell to your back and punch out 6 miles. And since you probably had a good meal and night's sleep, and that you have an air conditioned building with a water fountain nearby (as well as AEDs and probably EMTs), andf the fact that you're not concerned at log steps, root hazard, rock hazard, ice hazard, or blowdowns... then you ought to knock out 6 miles in 2 (3) hours or so. Aftyer that, you can set treadmill back to 0 and complete another 4-6 miles in another couple of hours. That is my example of a typical day on the AT. And if you want a full experience, repeat above exercise another 210 days.toe to Head assesment: My feet are doing great! I really liked my Lowa boots. My replacement Vasque's didn't have the innersoles and my feet were beginning to feel a little mushy. but I got new innersoles and it should be fine. i do have 4 broken toe nails so far and a brief problem with a couple of lazy toes; which have been taken care of with my ""toe socks"". My calves are MOOING, really uncomfortable and keeping me up at night. Thighs are doing good. I haven't felt like I've gotten my trail legs yet (I hope?) BPH is an annoyance. no problems with hip rubs from backpack. Gut is doing good, probably lost 10 lbs of belly fat. no hiker appetite quite yet. RA is bothering my hands and is my most concerning item at this time. mornings are especially diffiicult and I hope warmer weather will put this to the back burner. Hearrt and lungs are getting a full workout. My rest breaks record steady 90% MHR. Occasional cramps in my shoulder [Aside: it was 2010 in G'burg when I had a cyst explode in my shoulder and I had a PA cut it out here without benefit of a local anesthesic(sp?) but he did give me great happy pills] Ears are still ringing. And for my head, I'm hiking much smarter tah last hike. I stop for rest, water, food, temp control much more purposeively now, as opposed to my usual pushing to the breaking point. and when i have Berk hiking with me, she is good about kkeeping me on my toes.All for nowLife is Good","New Found Gap

Thank you much, the goodies were great!My stay at the Quality Inn was most enjoyable. The staff, especially GM were most helpful, the room was spacious, balcony over a flowing creek, gas log fireplace, convenient laundry and excellent breakfast. I more than OD'ed on the Belgian waffle, sausage/egg biscuit and Kryspy Kremes. I saw Scavenger and took the 1000 shuttle back to New Found Gap, a bobcat scampered in front of us. Doc, Panda, Road Runner and Outbacb were also on shuttle Had some more trail magic at the gap and then a quick 3 mi, 1000' climb to 1st shelter. I had only 2 quick stops and was feeling great. Just before the shelter I met a group of youngsters who asked me where Clingman'sDome was. I hated to tell them they just hiked 3 miles in the wrong direction. Also had a short section of knife edge hiking, e.g. Narrow ridge line with very sharp drop offs at each side.   Got to the Peck's shelter, watered up, ate and getting ready for bed.

I like to think that I have mellowed out quite a bit in retirement, but maybe not. After 2 negative experiences at Fontana Village, I left my concerns with a jr dep asst mgr who took copious notes and assured me I would be hearing immediately from the resort mgr. and this was after I was told there was a new concessionaire at the resort that wanted to cater to hikers. No word from said mgr yet. However, I heard about Doc's negative experiences in cabin rental, DG terrible service at another dining and another hiker that waited 1 1/2 hrs for a shuttle ride. So be advised NOBOers about Fontana Village.   Also, I have reason to visit area to visit this area with my granddarlings. I'll consider taking them to Helen or Franklin or even Gatlinburg. But Hell will freeze over before I consider Fontana. And then this am I called the GSMNP Supt or Dep to bark about thru hiker experience. I got a call back from the Exec to discuss 2 concerns. On my negative experiences with the thru hiker permit, the exec offered to fwd me to person responsible for the system. I politely replied that I didn't want to speak to the person responsible for the mess, I wanted to speak to that person's supervisor. She got the message and will send me a response. I may still write them a nasty gram based on the response. On the subject of animals (horses vs dogs) I got a very bureaucratic answer. I told the exec I understood her response but wasn't buying any of it. Later, I was reminded that TN is horse country and the light bulb came on for me.   So, I then planned a relaxing dinner with DG at TX Roadhouse. I order a steak medium rare and the waiter confirmed red center...Yes!   Out it came well done. I pointed it out to waiter, he insisted I cut open thickest piece of steak, no doubt, medium well done at best. He immediately took it back to kitchen. I was starving and really wanted to eat now. But it came back a superior piece of meat and perfectly cooked. GPS - The absolute best job I ever had was that as a booster payload integrator. I had no responsibilities for the rocket ship nor any for the satellite. My job was to make sure that once they were mated, that the booster placed the satellite in the orbit and in the condition that it was operable. And although my role was truly insignificant, I was the payload integrator for the launch of the 1st GPS satellite on a ""wheatfield"" Atlas rocket at Vandenberg AFB CA. At later date, I was the OOD at LAAFS, which was an assignment for a CGO to serve as the overnight ""Base Commander"" There was another GPS launch on my night tour and there was conflicting info on 2nd stage performance.    One of the duties that night was to inform the SD Commander (USAF 3 star general) of launch status. Time was passing and I decided to call commander with my report. He was living at Ft MacArthur and had observed the launch from San Pedro and confirmed good 2nd stage performance for me. Later, we had 7 sats in orbit and were testing ops concepts for GPS. During one period, there would be limited capabilty at Ft Mac. We hid a golf ball on the parade ground, gave the general the receiver and told him to find the golf ball. He did!! More later I was in the Pentagon advocating for space systems {Note: Another officer was responsible for GPS}. Space advocacy was a slight challenge at the time as the AF pilots wanted another airplane for what a couple of GPS satellites would cost. Fortunately, the Sec AF was at the time the covert director of the NRO and known as the Space Godfather. Now GPS systems are everywhere. I use the Motion X GPS app on my Iphone and it is better than my Garmin. I am quite successful in finding survey markers at my ranch in W Texas. And here on the trail, I use the app to record my position at the end of each hiking day, very easy and few keystrokes. I ?? GPS!","Gatlinburg TN

It was a tough hike today. The first 10 miles were mostly covered with ice and snow, and it got heavier as altitude increased. What made it interesting (dangerous) was the wind.

Doc did talk to the mgr about his cabin situation and will apparently get some refund. I took some photos and briefly talked to B2, but stopping even for a short period would bring on the chills. If Berk had to miss a stretch, this wasProbably a good one. I would have made her wear her hiking boots and she doesn't really like them. Before leaving G'burg I did talk to my dermatologist.

Last evening was an example. I was sitting in an easy chair, munching a bag of chips, slamming Gatorades and chatting with Blueberry Yum Yum. Up comes a guy, interrupts us and not even a : How are you doing?, good afternoon, my name is Sue, or may I ask a question....He: How old are you?   Me: Old Enough.   He: I'm 62 and a thru hiker. Me: I completed my 1st thru hike at 64.   Then He left....I like the Standing BearHostel. I shared the luxury cabin with Doc, Panda and Roadrunner. This place is called rustic.   The laundry is a washboard which the 3 amigos seriously lack proficiency. There is a dryer but the result was that they ended up burning all the dirt and smell into their clothes. The common kitchen area reminds me of an 1800s mining camp. The resupply shop has just about everything for a hiker and is very reasonably pricedI spent most of day cold and shivering at the hostel. Yesterday there were about 30 here, now it's only me waiting for Berk and Ungawa who is taking a zero. The PPs, B2 and Berk arrived late. I had givenB2 a large to do list and there was construction traffic delay. Lest I forget a great big shout out to B2 for the resupply, taking Berk and bringing the PPs to see me.    I got trail names for the PPs: Wild Cat and Honey Bee. I don't use use their names on social media but those that know the PPs should understand their trail names.   My tax plan is to be in Hot Springs (33 miles) on Mon nite I left Standing Bear with Berk after 4pm and hiked to 1st stream. There I watered Berk and had a pizza and draft beer ( this is a Saturday) courtesy of B2. I'm glad I'm not still in the Smokies. I hiked another 1 1/2 hrs and stopped at Snowbird Mtn, an FAA control site and called it a nightLife is Good!","Standing Bear Hostel

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527465,"Yesterday's short hike gained back 2800' that was left from the Smokies. I camped at the FAA tower site behind some large propane tanks. It was a good wind break and nice to have Berk back on the trail. Since I was next to a propane tank, I passed on shot breakfast and had Mtn House's blueberry granola which was very good and lots of caloriesIt was an easy hike to Max Patch. I came up to 2 mules and one asked me how my hike was going, just like my favorite columnist in Houston, Leon Hale I asked if they were related to Leon's mule and they said I Was silly, they were llamas. Llamas? Come se llama, me llama Tic. No, we're not Spanish. The older llama said her name was Wild Cat and her little sister was Honey Bee I said that was amazing because that are the trail names for my granddarlings   About that time another hiker was approaching and the llamas didn't want anyone else to know they talked so the wished me well on my hike and didn't speak anymoreMax Patch is one of my top 5 places on the AT and it didn't disappoint. I was fortunate in2010 to spend the other on the patch wig a full moon... very beautiful   I had a leftover cold pizza lunch with my last growler of beer. It was outstanding. Thanks B2. Today's hike climbed 2600', but I counted 5 200' straight up and downs that would never show up on the maps I continued hiking on to the shelter and stopped for some trailmagic just short of the shelter I OD'ed on double stuffed Oreos, leaving plenty for other hikers and drank the last Mtn Dew. I then got ready for throats little stretch to the shelter and DISASTER. NO TENT!!!! In my rush to leave Standing Bear, I left out my bungee cords to secure my tent. And my morning arthiritis prevented my fingers for really securing the tent. It's getting late, temps are falling, it has been sprinkling lightly and the wind is picking up.   There were a lot of options to consider, but I took the safest and proceeded directly to the shelter. I texted B2 (now Ground Control) to put him on alert to send me a replacement. Another option was the outfitter in Hot Spring$ NC. Rabbit came in at dark and reported seeing the tent on the side of the trail about 4 miles S. Tthere was room in the shelter and I convinced Pookey to trade places so Berk and could be together   I'd think about the tent options tomorrowLife is Good","Snowbird Mtn

WL: Anybody missing an REI tent? YES!!   Thank you WL, Thank you Lord and the Angels and I were singing the Hallelujah Chorus. The shelter didn't provide much relief from the howling winds all night. And Berk slept all night on my head, sometimes her head and sometimes her butt. I fixed breakfast and sought out WL to give home a substantial reward,but he refused. He said today was his 21st birthday and I could buy him a beer. I ended up forcing him to take a $20 for his beer tonight. The start of today's hike was troubling.   Berk was limping in right front. I checked her paws and nothing obvious. I placed boots on her front paws and these were a non starter. I lightened her load and proceeded on her pace. She still got energized by squirrels and chipmunks, so I decided to proceed. But she got more troubling as we proceeded. She was getting plenty of water and I was stopping for rest breaks quite frequently for her. But she was still laboring. Finally, I took over her whole back pack and loaded up on almost max water. Instantly, she had recovered. More contakerness: We proceeded on a brisk pace but I was watching her closely.   We came around a corner and there was a 30ish couple with 2 loose huskies. I yelled for them to control their dogs. The lady grabbed and leashed the smaller husky. The larger husky approached in a threatening manner. I yelled for the man to control his dog again, put Berk on a sit stay, shortened her cable and stood in front of her. the husky was bearing down fast on us and was within 1 step of me breaking my hiking poles across his head. The man came up and started beating the dog. I said it wasn't the dogs that should be beaten and at the time I thought I was the man for the jobWe got into Hot Springs and the hostel that was recommended as dog friendly had changed owners and were no longer that dog friendly. I made a reservation at a court in town. I saw Candyman at the hostel, as well as Huck, Pluto, Sacajewa and several others. Pluto even gave me some crystallized ginger, which I call chocolate. I ate with Candyman at the Creekside, taking in the hiker burger. I think I'm getting my hikers appetite.

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527624,"Great day for a zero. Rain all am and doesn't look like Sun will be making an appearance today. No AT&T service here, so difficult to access some secure websites since they require a text confirmation code.   Went to library for some limited computer access, minor resupply at outfitter and $General. Ate lunch at diner and now doing laundry. I've been trying to coordinate my next resupply with GC, which has been a challenge. Hemlock Hollow doesn't know whether they are open or not and no answer from Laurel Trading Post. So, it looks like 70 miles to Uncle Johnny's in Erwin I planned to go to the Hot Springs spa, but several reported it was more like tepid springs and no jets So, I passed on that and will do with a hot shower. Saw Red Hat today. I met her on my worst day in 2009, day 5 into 7 days of solid rain. She remembersThat day and me, and now lives near Standing Bear. Today she is operating the Hikers Ridge Ministry Resource I had hoped to expand some on Berk, this being a zero. So here's my iPhone attempt. She had a prime checkup about 6 months ago and a final checkup just before we left. she got some GI pills which happen to identical to mine. My biggest concern with her is a snakebite, real to me as I stepped over a trophy timber rattler in my 2010 hike. We did some""practice"" hikes, but no real way to simulate the AT. Other canine considerations are motels and hostels that will accept dogs. For instance, the highly recommended hostel here has changed owners and no longer allow dogs, and the motel here that does accept dogs charges a premium. For the trail, my major concern was her nutrition She has never been a regular eater and I offer her 2 cups of food twice a day. Her normal food was about 350 kcal/ cup, but her trail food is over 500 kcal/ cup I did slightly over stress her a week or so back, but have been watching her most closely now. Yesterday's performance does have me concerned. Hopefully it was only a one time event. Otherwise I may have to reconsider having her on the trail. With the exception of yesterday, she has eagerly looked forward to hiking. She helps load her backpack and charges forward on her hike command. We're still working On right and left turn. And she really begs for pets from the other hikers. At night she gets her coat brushed ( primarily to remove dirt, twigs, leaves), she gets her paws treated with Mushers Secret and then a full body massage. Talk about canine estasy, her eyes roll back into her head and her tongue is fully extended. I do get quite upset with the number of people who do not control their dogs and allow them to approach in a threatening manner. It's not the dogs fault but I sure would like to teach the owner a lesson. Berk rested much of the day and on a short walk she appeared well and was in full hunt mode. It might be a long stretch until my next stop, so postings might be quiet for awhile or limited to simple waypoint positions. But all this might be moot since there has been no AT&T service lately","Hot Springs NC

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528016,"The last night in Hot Springs was relative quiet. I nice dinner at the Iron Horse Restaurant and the a nice hot shower, Berk also. At the outfitter resupply I got Berk a new pad which she much prefers, as she was stretched out fullyI had a nice breakfast at the Smoky Mtn Diner, finished resupply at $General, stopped by outfitter for pack adjustment and then was on my way.   The next resupply planning had really been a struggle. With Berk having issues on our last hike, I didn't know whether I was going to go out for a 1/2 day and then bring her back, or press on to next stop at 70 miles. So, I was leaving HS with pack wt N of 50 lbs!The French Broad river and bridge N of town were quite pretty. I hooked up with the 5x20s. The original 5 were Patches, Count, Yosamite, Doc and Scavenger. Doc dropped out to make some grad school decisions ((very right kid into cancer research) and Scavenger has regularly been behind and in front. They have been replaced by 2 Brits: Boss and Samquatch. It was the typical rough climb leaving town. Less than a mile into it, we were met by a lady and ANOTHER loose dog. She said she had forgotten her leash and no problem as hers was a very friendly dog.   2 steps from Berkeley she starts being aggressive. Lady says the dog has never done that. I was tempted to say that I can make sure it never does it again. But again, stupid pet owners It was a fair hike hike today, although over the 13+ miles, I don't thing 600 yds, 800 max, were level. The Mtn Laurel were smelling great in the am and I was beginning to see the formation of some rhododendron tunnels. I filled up with water at the last shelter and my Steripen died. No problem, I have 2 gas canisters and can always boils water if I can't yogy a Sawyer squeeze filter. As I started to cook dinner, my gas canister went empty. Water ahead is scarce so I filled my 3L bladder, 1L Nalgene bottle and Berks pint+ bottle. It was late in the afternoon and I wanted to hike another couple of hours. I came across the 5x20s and Samquatch had some AAs I could have. When I opened my Steripen, the new lithium batteries had broken apart. I cleaned up the corroded contacts and it was functioning, but not reliable. Since I was carrying almost 9 #s of water and now had a Steripen working, I offered to offload some of my water. I ended up topping off several bottles and the. Went on to hike some more before dark. I found a good campsite and got set up. I was thinking about having a nite mocha and discovered by bladder was missing. Too late to go back and I now had less than a pint I'll have to look for it tomorrow. Also, it's not a good idea to be long distance hiking and lose your shelter and your water. The only thing I can think of worse, is to get hurt or injured. I may have to reconsider hiking if I continue to lose things. Life is Good","Hot Springs 0

I left Berk in camp and was hiking shortly after 600 am. I met me NOBO who reported seeing it, but couldn't remember where. To make long story short, I hiked back to shelter with no luck   I got back to camp and broke down to start hiking I leapfrogged the 5x20s we had an early 2500 climb, of which 1100' were over the last 1.3 miles (Mtn math says that's a 16% grade!!!) I was thinking about stopping at a shelter or maybe the next water source. But it was still early and we were making good time. So we pressed on to the next shelter. The 1st challenge was the 16% grade.   Next it was less than a mile to next water and then little over 4.5 miles to next shelter. It was just after 5, the terrain was relatively flat, I should easily hike 1.5 mph and more likely 2.0+ mph. And that I did for awhile. And the we hit Firescald Knob. It was rocky and the most technical part yet. There were places where I had to take Berk off leash. This was probably about a mile in length but I wouldn't want to guess how long it took us to get thru it. We took rest breaks, drank most all our water and got to shelter just before dark. N got tent set up, water refilled and Bear bags hung. ""Geo"" came around and was offering cookies. We introduced ourselves and Geo said he had hiked with another Tic, a rocket scientist from Houston. I didn't remember him but he recalled it was in 2010, at Shaws Lodging in Monson ME with Tater Chip. (I remember him, last name was Lays). Small world. A lot of the other hikers are noting that this last stretch was a tough climb. Berk and I are going to bed and sleep in late   tomorrow. And we passed the 300 mile milestoneLife is Good!","Deep Gap +

After the hard day yesterday I was really enjoying sleeping in late. In fact, except for Scavenger who is always the last one to leave, we were it, leaving just before 1000. The hike up until midafternoon was quite enjoyable. Cool wx, light breeze, green meadows and mostly downhill   However, we were brought back to reality I the afternoon. We had a 1600' climb in nearly 3 miles. Mtn math says that's a 10% climb over 3 miles. I did see some surveyor's tape where it looks like the CMC intends to insert some switchbacks into the trail. I had talked to one of theCMC trail maintainers and he said thief goal was to have a max 10% grade.   Good luck on that one, I e seen to many 16-18%ers that I'm ready to leave CMC territory. I leapfrogged with Scavenger, Pookie, Willow and the 5x20s.   Got into camp before 7, set up tent, got some water, ate and ready for bed.

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528378,"I was the first up and the last out of the thru hikers to leave this am. I was hiking before 0800, but all the others were interested in hitching a ride to a diner for breakfast. I passed on that because I wanted to put in the miles today to make Uncle Johnny's on Sunday. I yogied some water from Willow before we left. I quickly made Sam's Gap where I met Ric and Spiro. Ric has bad foot issues and Spiro was waiting for his girlfriend. I yogied more water from Ric and Spiro. Had another 1700' climb with its fair share of 16-18% grade. Got up to Big Bald for some photo ops. Met a nice family and yogied 2 bottles of water   After Big Bald, it's almost 18 miles of downhill...SWEEEET!!!   I did say almost because Big Rocks was another technical challenge.   We were cruising but Berk was fading a bit. I stopped several times for her and she had plenty of water breaks, lying down in one of the streams. It was getting late and I was beginning to think about finding a place to camp or a place to eat or a place to get water. I was hoping one of the 5x20s would pass me and allow me to treat some water.   I was hiking and came up on a pretty little meadow with a vixen all alone. (For Capt Mike: think Philmont 1992). It was a perfect match. Her name is Queen Sweeper, a Czech. She had a nice campsite by the stream and a gravity filter, but she was light on food I got my water bottles refilled and offered her a variety of food. She insisted on trading and I obliged by taking a brownie and a tootsie roll pop. After eating I joined her for a short period.

I really enjoyed my evening last night and socializing with Queen Sweeper. I was most impressed with her camping skills, but somewhat taken aback with her backpacking skills. She reported that the had started on Mar 1 and I figured than to be something over 7 miles per day. At that rate, she will never make it to Katahdin before Oct 15. I was up early and I asked if she wanted to hike together. It was 13 miles to Uncle Johnny's and I thought she might need some help getting to Johnny's today. She accepted and we left before 0830. Another hiker (Sebastian) had came in late last night and camped at the meadow as well. He was moving but a little slow. QS and I hiked the short distance to Spivey Gap where a short uphill began. Berk and I start slowly and I told her to go ahead and we would catch up later. QS took up the hill like a rocket. One turn and she was out of sight. About 30 minutes later a saw a hiker ahead of me struggling with a hill. I immediately thought of a favorite saying of my neighbor and oil plant gang pusher, J.D. Hightower: (Note: edited for social media) ""Dog Poop Fast, Don't Poop Long"". I was sure it was QS had taken off too fast and now had crashed and burned. WRONG!! It was another hiker struggling. ( Note: I did catch up with QS at the hostel. She arrived about 3 hours before us. I also thought of another trail name for her: Hot Czech). After recently whining about the CMC 16-18% grades, I must admit today was a most pleasant hike. However, Berk faded badly on the last 3 miles. I slowed down, took long breaks and had plenty of water for her but she was done. I would give her the hiking command and she would just look at me, whereas she normally would charge out to the end of her cable. Later, she would just move to the side of the trail and lay down. I took her pack off and secured it to mine. Instant recovery! She could hike and hunt. We made it to Uncle Johnny's mid afternoon for the start a very down afternoon. I went to check in and informed Johnny that I had called yesterday, made a reservation, and secured with a credit card. He was embarrassed a bit and said that an old lady who had the room had not vacated and was staying over another day. He did offer me free tenting I the back and no charge for a Gatorade I picked up. I wasn't too pleased about all this bit accepted it as life happens. Later the old lady came in and Johnny said it was her that stayed over and kept the room. The old B@&$@ then said she was glad to do it and not the least bit sorry. Now I was really P.O.ed and left before I did something regretful. I went out back and set up my tent and was beginning to cool off a bit. Even took a relaxing lukewarm shower. I was out relaxing and just beginning to chill out a bit when Willow shows up and wants me to move my tent so she could secure her hammock to a tree I was under. Why not, it's just another little more annoyance. The hostel runs BLD shuttles into town, several miles away. I think we had 21 in the van on the ride into town. Its been old home week here at the hostel, over a dozen I have seen and hiked with before. Went to a decent TexMex restaurant and a minmum WalMart visit.

What would you like more/ less?   Or any other comments....Last night wasn't very restful. Berk and I were in our tent, along with a couple of other 2 or 3 dozen tenters in the back yard. There was a fire and large group of young ones having a jolly old time, well past time. I'm very hard of hearing but was able to recognize at least 3 different loud conversations going on into the wee hours. Then I was up at 0500 for nature visit and decided to do my laundry. The hostel is rated for 20 people and there were well over 50 staying the night. The hostel reserves the one saber and dryer from 8-500 and is open to guests the rest of the time. Last night at 1000pm the queue for the washer was 3 deep. But, I had the entire laundry to myself. I also had some very hot water as my shower yesterday afternoon was lukewarm at best. After completing laundry I went back for another nap until 0800 and then took the 0830 shuttle to breakfast. I returned to the hostel and was given a very nice cabin room ( like the one I had reserved Sat for last nite...) TV, DVD player, microwave, refridge, cast iron bed frame and AC outlet. Although I may have made some discouraging comments about Willow, I like her and we have planned to share a cookout together tonite. Last night we watched and drooled over the ultimate cookout by about a dozen hikers. Many of us took the noon shuttle to the AYCE pizza place. Pretty good and I must report that my first plate was all salad stuff. Then went to local grocery store to stock up for tonite's cookout. I picked out a good sized steak and Willow found one that she thought was more than she wanted. I told Willow she could then become Berkeley's best friend tonight.   I declared today the second Sunday this weekend. You see, my RA doc and I have this agreement, which is that I take my RA pills on Wed and then can have 2 beers on Sat and Sun. Since this is a second Sunday, I'll take my RA pills on the 2nd Wed this week Willow and I had a cookout tonite. She said it was her best dinner yet. Berkeley probably agrees because she got a lot of leftover steak.

If I have Internet connection And good battery power, I'll check email and other internet sites. Hardcore was missing some of the waypoints for a map he is maintaining of my hiking progress. So I figured out which waypoints he needed and retransmitted them via the MotionX iPhone app. This sends the waypoints automatically to Facebook and 6 email id's   I put a note on FB for readers to disregard these retrans. Not known to most, I also have a code for my email responders that will indicate when things aren't going so well and when to call out the SAR team. I immediately got a call from one of my email addressees who thought this might be my SOS signal.   Thankfully, I was able to respond that all was wellI slept pretty well last night and had planned a rather leisurely morning. I needed to make a couple of business calls after 1000 EDT and checkout time wasn't until 1100. At the grocery store run yesterday, I bought some sausage,cheese, egg griddle cakes and a jar of instant coffee. One of my calls was to get, Dr Lori to discuss Berk's situation. She reported that I was doing everything correctly, but if I wanted to be absolutely sure about her heating situation then I would need to start taking her temperature. I don't have a thermometer so we agreed on using the tongue-o-meter. If Berk's tongue is resting on her teeth, hike on; if tongue is sticking out 1"", rest, water and monitor closely; and if tongue is sticking out 3"", siesta time. We also discussed dogs are lying down over 3/4 of time and Berk probably hasn't truly bought into the fact that we're going to be hiking 8-10 hrs a dayI checked out at about 1030 and had a nice discussion with Uncle Johnny. I told him how disappointed I was with him in that I made a reservation with him, he insisted that I secure my reservation with a credit card and then he allows a person to stay over past their stay. He is then unable to honor my reservation or offer comparable lodging. I did ""accept"" his offer of free camping in the back yard, but told him that had I known a couple of dozen hikers would be having a loud, late night party adjacent to my tent, I would have gone on the trail and camped at the river. I then told hi that had a person been ill or injured, I would have gladly given them my room. However, since that person stated she was glad to stay over and not the least bit sorry about the consequences really upset me. And I informed Uncle Johnny I held him personally responsible for allowing this happen. He offered to refund my payment if that would make me happy. I told him I wasn't interested in the money and want to help businesses that support hikers, praise them when they do well and critique them when they perform poorly. I concluded by calling him a dishonorable man and that point stuck on him. I was glad to leave then. Then hike was very pleasant today and I didn't whine a bit about the 2700' climb. I made the 1st shelter shortly after noon. It's great to have a functioning water filter now and even better to have Guthook's trail map app. Rick, now Sage, Lassie and jacks passed me by. I was taking it very easy with Berk today. I came to Beauty Spot Gap and took a couple of pix. Just a bit up the trail was a water source and good campsite. Lassie was already set up for the evening. Swamp Turtle was a SOBO completing a thru hike and Willow stopped for water. I filled my water containers and decided to have supper and then planned to hike to dark or next campsite. I was getting ready to leave when Night Shift, former thru hiker, drove up with a box of Bojangles Chicken and biscuits and a jug of ice tea. I took a piece of chicken and 1'biscuit and left the rest for Lassie and any others that might show up. I then got back on the trail. But I was heavy and it was getting close to sundown.

I then had a pint of B&J ice cream and if I had looked at today's hike I might have had a 2nd pintI slept well and was up early. I put Berk out on her cable and she Dixie were having a good ol time. Some of the neighbors chickens came over and Dixie was in hot pursuit. CeCe tried to get Dixie to return to no avail and Berk was straining at the end of the cable, dying to show Dixie how to do itI went into the hostel and fixed breakfast and settled my account with CeCe. Also took a picture of MissStep floor tile. I was with her when she started her 2009 SOBO   Lassie came in and asked if Berk was supposed to be loose. NO, I ran to the door expecting to see the front yard littered with dead chickens. Fortunately, Berk just wanted to come inside to play with Dixie. I settled my bill with CeCe and asked how her GoFundMe campaign was going. She said it's about 1/3 completed. She will need to raise the remainder to complete a new roof and then obtain a note to buy out former partner. Otherwise, we hikers may be missing a hostel next year. So, please consider theGreasy Creek Friendly Hostel as a worthy causeI had several options for my next stop/ resupply when I got a good recommendation from AstroGuy to try Vango/Abby. It just happened to fit in nicely. I had sent an email previously and wanted to follow up with a call before leaving as cell service is due to be suspect again. Got a good exchange, set up for a shuttle tomorrow. Also got a heads up about a wild fire. Several people had sent email about the fire in VA, but that is quite a bit away. There is a fire though just ahead of us that has forced a closure and detouring of some AT hikers, but it shouldn't be a Threat to usWe left around 0900, and climbed 500' back to the AT. Quick hike to next shelter where I saw Ungawa. Next a 900' climb to next gap where I saw Bean and ?? who appeared to be considering a shuttle after seeing Roan Mtn approach, wildfire news and rain wx forecast. I was pleased to see that a new trail has been cut, as the old one was straight up and down. Here we began a 2200' climb. About 1/2 way up I heard some voices up ahead and then it HAPPENED! Out of nowhere 2 dogs came charging at us, a medium collie and a very large black mix. The owner yelled they were friendly. With no time to call out, I stepped in front on Berk and grabbed both hiking poles in the middle when the large dog was about 5 ' away. At 2' I swung as hard as I could and laid into the large dog's head with the cork handles. If that didn't stop him, the next blow was going to be carbide tips into the chest. The dog cried out and retreated and the other followed suit The owner yelled I didn't need to hit him with a hiking pole. I yelled back she needs to control her dogs   And I'm so proud of myself that I didn't add a few choice expletives. She didn't have a leash and grabbed her dogs as we hiked on out of the way.   The friendly dog was growling at us as we passed. Later at a rest stop, she apologized which I accepted. But again, lousy pet ownerWe finally got to the top of Roan Mtn and I think the CMC did a commendable job on the trail. After a short decline, another 400' climb. In the clearing now it was quite evident to where the fire is burning. The wind is at our back and they're hoping for rain toniteIt's strange that there were 50+ at Uncle Johnny's earlier this week. I don't think I've seen a dozen thruhikers on the trail these last several days. We got into the shelter late, watered up and ate. Getting ready for bed now.

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529398,"O-25Just before dark last night, I was joined on the trail by Ungawa. And just before arriving at the shelter, we met Beaver who was fixing to camp out for the night in a small cave. At the shelter were the Sandwich Men (Jimmie and John), and another section hiker who had already pitched his tent and retired for the evening. Ungawa decided to pitch his tent nearby and I decided Berk and I would stay in the shelter as there was plenty of space and it was predicted to rain overnight. It wasn't a very comfortable night. THe wind was strong and just blew thru my sleeping bag. I haven't been able to keep my feet warm and last night was especially challenging. And then it started a light rain and the wind blew it into the shelter. I got up and rearranged by ground cloth to act as a cover from the wind. With the exception of Ungawa, we were all up and hiking early. I stopped briefly at the side trail to the Overmountain Shelter. Met ShadowBox and Yukon who were just leaving. They reported a good number of hikers had spent the night there in the barn. It was a comfortable hike to this long, open bald. There it was mostly straight uphill with an 800 and 600' climb and about 3 miles in length. It was heavy overcast, not very scenic and there were several false peaks.   It started raining at one of the false peaks and I put on my rainjacket. I then attempted to put on Berk's rain poncho I made for her earlier. However, I didn't field test my creation and it failed miserably. We hiked on and just as we were getting to the actual peak, there was a loud thunderbumper off in the distance. I couldn't detect any specific storm cell nearby, but Berk doesn't like rain or thunder and I certainly don't like thunder on the ridge. We put it into overdrive and cleared the bald. It started to rain a bit heavier, making the mud quite slippery, as well as the most covered rocks. It was raining quite heavily at Doll Flats, where we crossed the NC border for the last time. I was going to take a photo but it was too wet to expose my iphone. I had made a reservation to stay at Vango Abby Hostel on the recommendation of AstroGuy and last direct contact was for Scottie to pick me up at 19E crossing at 5:00 pm.   That call was made 27 miles back and before a mile elevation climb; and I had thought about sliding that time to at least 6pm and maybe as late as 7 pm. I said I would call to give a better ETA whenever I got a cell signal. But, after a better than expected day Thurs and the quicktime hike off the bald, I was now projecting a 4pm, possibly 3:30 arrival and called that in on a voicemail msg. It rained more and we hiked a bit faster. I tried to update my ETA, but the phone case was too wet to accept any inputs. We arrived at 19E about 2pm. Shaggy and Whiplash had just left. Beaver +2 were looking for a place to stay and told Scottie Berk nd I were here, and Jordy decided to hike on N. Scottie picked us up and took us to the hostel. Scotie is a self proclaimed hillbilly, and I like hillbillies. I hward piano music when we arrived at the hostel. Lt Dan was there playing beautifully. Scottie played later as well. We talked about space work in the Florida and I was assigned the most comfortable ""Astronaut"" private room, which Berk heartily approved. Took a nice hot shower and washed my clothes.

I was up early and fixed my breakfast in the luxurious ""astronaut"" quarters at the Vango Abby Hostel. I was slackpacking today and decided to hike ""backwards"", i.e. South, from the hostel back to US 19E. I also decided to give Berkeley a zero today to rest up and recover more. It was a very easy and picturesque hike. Long runs by the Elk River and two nice waterfalls. I was interested in the ""backwards"" hike so that on my shuttle pickup, I might be able to go to town for resupply and possibly an adult BEvERage, this being a Saturday. Scottie, the hostel owner, also suggested a S hike in order to see who was ahead/behind me. And I'm glad, for this allowed me to see more than a dozen hikers I probably would not see otherwise. One of the first I saw was Vera/Queen Sweeper/Hot Czech. She is a favorite of mine and was surprised and anxious to see me (She feared she may have been hiking the wrong direction!) Also saw Smiles, Sandwich Boys, Jordy, Sage (Rich), Shadow Box, Yukon, Puma, shotgun, Blueberry YY, and others. I quickly hiked to 19E and was immediately picked up by Scottie and Buzzard. We went into town and pigged out at the local BBQ joint, very good. And surprise, Willow and Pookie were just leaving.   Stopped at the Valero on way to hostel, only to find out this is a dry town    Got back to hostel, took care of the dog and started getting gear ready for hiking out tomorrow.

I was up early and the temp was 30 deg, pretty chilly am. We had a great breakfast and I was hiking before 0800. It was a great hike today, don't think we had much over 1000' ft gain/loss all day. Just N of the hostel was the FS road that was closed for the wildfire. It had a notice the trail was now open. I hiked to the shelter and smelled the fire at one place, but didn't really see anything disturbing. However, shortly after leaving the shelter one could see fire damage on the W side of the trail. This lasted for less than a mile and then the fire had spread to both sides of the trail. The trail was in very good shape and the fire covered the trail for another 3 or 4 miles. I did see several logs still smoldering but these didn't present a threat. The last mile was worrisome in that my left Achilles was complaining quite a bit. I had planned to stop at Kincora's Hostel to say hello and thanks to Bob People's for all the work he does on the AT and for us hikers. I also was going to talk about my prior SOBO visit in 2010.

I fixed breakfast and got all my stuff ready to hike. I went to tell Bob thanks and goodbye, and Buzzard followed me and was asking about slack packing. Next thing I knew we were driving to Wilbur Dam Road with plans to slackpack S back to the hostel. It was a pretty hike, and we passed over the Watauga Dam. The shelter was closed due to bear activity. Also, there had a been a recent fire near this shelter and there is some speculation the two recent fires near the AT shelters were intentionally set. I just hope it wasn't some careless hiker that set these fires. I passed several hikers I've seen over the last few weeks. Ponds Flats was a challenging 1700'   Watauga Lake .was a pretty rest break. And the prettiest part was the Laurel Creek and Laurel Falls. There was a lot of rock hiking the last several miles and at one place we missed the trail turn and ended up hiking about 15 mins into never never land. Buzzard and us returned to the hostel about 1630, just enough time for me to shower before the 1700 grocery store run. Willow, Pookie and Chatterbox stopped by to coordinate doe future travel.

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530020,"Meadow MM 448.116.9O-21Kincora's Epilogue. I feel it was an honor and pleasure to stay at Kincora's and visit with Bob Peoples. He has done more for the AT and us hikers than the next 10 people combined. My original plans was to meet Bob Sun to 1) express my appreciation for all his support 2) reminisce about my 2010 visit (my thank you post card is on the inside door sill just above the light) 3) ask how to get into the Braemer Castle since Brown's Grocery ( the inn keeper was closed on Sun) and 4) inquire about Fahmah, a 2010 hiker who works Hardcore with Bob. There is a notice in the guidebook and at the hostel entrance that no dogs are allowed. I had Berk cabled to a tree near the entrance and Bob gave me a waiver to stay with Berk if I kept her in the Executive suite. And we didn't harm any cats, Bob has 17 felines and 3 raccoons. I have always believed there is a special place in heaven for those who care for severely ill and disabled. Bob has earned another place. He has put up a hiker, Wolf, and his Catahoula Hound, Duncan, in a cabin behind the hostel. Wolf's body is being ravaged by leukemia and just left the hospital after some major surgery   we fixed a couple of meals for Wolf. Berk and I visited am and pm. It was funny to watch Berk play alpha dog with Duncan, who was easily twice her size. So please add a short prayer for Wolf for a speedy recoveryToday was nearly perfect. I had cooked up breakfast the nite before and left in the fridge to be heated up this am. I was up at 0500 and put the dish in the oven to warm up. Someone started the coffee and were good to go shortly after 0630. I had a leisurely breakfast and several ( many) cups of coffee as we scheduled our shuttle departure for 0830. We went to the Wilbur Dam Rd and Buzzard was off hiking. I stayed to conduct some phone business andpribably followed 1/2 later. It was a brisk 1900' climb to start. We got to the first shelter and Buzzard had to prod a timber rattlesnake off the path I had a quick snack and water break and on to the next shelter. I passed QueenSweeper who looked like she was setting up camp at 1600. Quick stop at the shelter and on to the next water source. There I fixed dinner and fed Berk. Qs and Mountain Goat (Aussie Lassie) passed as I was eating. It was getting late in the day and water availability was getting to look problematic. MG stopped at the 1st poor stream and I passed on expecting a better one in next 0.1 mile. I went about 0.2 and retreated to fill up at the poor stream. Took about 1/2 hour for 3 liters but I was good for the nite. Back on the trail and of course there was a outstanding stream just another 100 yds from where I stopped earlier. I planned to hike to a forward meadow and call it a night. I came around a corner and there was QS and MG on a log pigging out. There was the most outstanding trail magic at this stop. I remember this for my 2010 hike it was sponsor by the Mtn Home Babtist Church and they have a large metal box to secure the goodies when I hiked in 2010 I came upon this box early in them and the Sun was shining across the top which had 3 crosses cut out of the top. For some reason I had images of the KKK. But back to the magic: they had a cooler filled with ice and drinks. They had all kinds of sweets ( my favorite was the 560 cal honey bunS ). And not to be dismissed were the home made cookies   We ate our fill, signed the register and secured the box. It was a short hike to the meadow and I wanted to shut down at theN end. On the way, we passed some ranchers who were unloading a cow and calf into a pasture with other cows and calves. Here theAT passes thru the cattle pasture for about 1/4 mile. The rancher told me to unleash the dog. He was afraid the cows would chase the dog/me to protect the calves. I wasn't to excited about this idea but did remove the cable from my waist and held it as we passed thru the pasture. One cow did approach but Berk was on guard and we safely got past the cow pasture. I the went to the end of the meadow and set up camp QSand MG set up just down the meadow.

There is an AT tradition to eat a 1/2 gallon of ice cream at the 1/2 point in PA. I don't know anything about 1/3s, but how about a quart of ice cream at the 1/4 point. And since I'm not at the 1/5 point, anybody have any suggestions for a 1/5 to celebrate?I was up early and hiking before 0800. MG was already hiking and SQ was decidedly behind. I quickly made the 1st shelter for a short rest break. Buzzard and several others were there. Joker and Dad were in the renting area. I then hiked to the next shelter for. Long lunch and rest stop. The water source was a full 1/4 miles down and deep slope and water ahead was problematic. So, I took on 5+ liters. I planned on 2 for lunch, 1 for hiking, 1 for the nite and 1 for the morning until next water source. This section of the trail is supposed to be the ""TN Turnpike"", a 33 mile section of basically flat land. But, I wouldn't call it a turnpike, maybe just a bit less of what we have been hiking lately. There is a challenge now to do this section in 1 day and I think Willow, Pookie and Chatterbox are going to try tomorrow. I wish them luck and a safe hike.   Also, there seems to be a bumper crop of poison ivy on the trail this year. Berkeley is doing fine but seems to really tire after 8-9 hours of hiking. In the morning she clears blow downs like a high jumper. At the end of the day she just wallows over them. I had originally intended to make today an easy hike, maybe 12-15 miles and the complete the remainder ( to make 20) on Thurs for a very short hike into town and then a zero on Friday. But I was making good time and when it came time to look for a camping site at the end of the day, there were still several hours of daylight left. I called the hostel to see if I could move my cabin reservation up a day. The answer was no, but they could put me up in a number of options. So I decided to up the hike to warp speed, ate all my snacks, camel led up water, dumped the rest of water and flew low. I got to the hostel before 1900. There were several dogs there and one that just left had left a negative impression. Of the options available, I chose to tent out back as the best one for Berk and I. I pitched the tent, got her water and the took a nice hot shower. I then stowed Berk in the tent and went into town with Sage for. Supper. The only place open was a ""Mexican"" food place. Sage got a Greek salad and said it was anything but Greek, I made a similar comment about the burrito. Saw a lot of troopers I've been hiking with recently. After dinner I got a pint of B&J and shortly thereafter a storm arrived with heavy thunder. I got into the tent and started to stow everything away. Berk was shaking the entire time.

I had planned to set up short of D on Wed nite and then have a short day Thur and a zero on Fri. Besides2 easy days, I could then justify Fri as an early Sat and have my 2 rations of week end beer. I do plan to blue blaze the Virginia Creeper Trail, as I consider this the best blue blaze on entire AT. However, this is also a very popular biking trail and in 2009 I had a very negative experience with an aggressive biker. And I expect the weekend to be a very busy biker day and don't want a repeat hiking now with Berk. And the lure of a hot shower and warm meal came be very motivating. So, I called into the hostel to see if I could slide my cabin reservation up. No, but they could accommodate us otherwise. Camel up on water, dump the rest, eat all the snacks and throttle up to warp speed I was hurting last nite. The short hike into town for dinner was a struggle. We had rain and lightning, with some thunder most of the night. Berk did reasonably well. Had a great breakfast at Woodchuck's and clarified some registration mystery this am.

(Note: I was hiking SOBO in 2009 when I got word from LL that she had cancer with surgery to be scheduled ASAP. I had stopped at the biker outfitter but they weren't able to offer much help.

Tubs of fresh fruit, iced drink, small box of snacks, an incredibly large box of hiker supplies and even dog food for Berk. I the skies were threatening and we left just before it opened. We got into town and checked into the motel. First order was a bath for Berk and a shower for me. I then did a first order sort of cleaning out my gear. Went out to dinner with Bunkie. Came back to motel and crashed and burned. Life is Good!","Partnership Shelter

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531406,"May 4Atkins VA Zero DayI was up early and went up to the Barn for breakfast. Saw 5 Star, Pops, Sunny and Gypsy. Then went back to hotel to start drying out gear and cleaning up. I had my tent out to dry out and was ordering some online supplies. I wasn't paying too much attention to my surroundings, when the owners son came and pointed out that it was raining on my tent.   In my 2009 hike I stayed at a hostel run by Rambunny and Aqua. I called Rambunny and had nice talk, but learned that Aqua has serious health challenges.   I had nice lunch at the Mexican restaurant and saw Mama Bear, Moose and Raw. And on the way back to the hotel ran into Bean and hub who had trail magic for Berk. I bummed a ride into ""town"", 3 miles away to visit PO and Dollar General   Got all my business done and yogied a ride back to motel. Tried to pay for the hitch but guy refused and seemed miffed I even suggested paying. I checked my drying work and noticed shoes and insoles need a lot more attention. Most everything else will be ok tonite. I got Berk a hog bone but she really wasn't all that interested in it. I've had the heat on at highest setting to speed up the equipment drying, slammed a good number of vitamin C and have been chugging Tylenol cold medicine most of the day. I'm tired and we're going to bedLife is Good!","Atkins VA

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531578,"Musings:Note to self - don't sandwich two hard days around a single zero day. Very little rest and recovery Note 2 to self - don't drink Mtn Dew again late at night, as you'll never get back to sleepIn celebration of completing 1/4 of the AT, I ate a quart (and a half) of ice cream and regretted it most of the nightThis is my 1st time to have 2 consecutive zeroes As you may imagine, even though one may not be hiking on a zero day, there is enough work in resupply, cleaning/repairing gear, planning, etc to keep one busy and not get enough rest. My last zero was worthless as I had two strong days on each side of it. That, along with a cold I've been fighting ( and losing) and a nasty wx forecast has me choosing a 2nd zero today. I've contacted Lumpy and we're planning to meet up in Pearisburg   Next week. I'll also plan my next stop in Daleville and will identify mail drops for a first time. We've been hiking, for us, some serious mileage lately, 18-20 mile days   A lot of this was driven by rain and thunderstorms with the desire to lay up in a shelter or town, vice camping in tent. This is probably too many miles for Berk and I plan to drop this back to the 15 mile range. Hopefully about 10 miles in am/early afternoon, long dinner break/rest in mid-late afternoon, and then another 5 late in the dayMail drops: I haven't listed mail drops before for several reasons. first, you need to identify when and where you will be, have a place that accepts mail drops ( and most charge a reasonable fee) and have stuff you need and can't readily find available. Since my next increment was pretty much planned by Lumpy, I'm adding this and my next planned stop to check out mail drops if anyone would like to send us a ""care package"". First, forget healthy, organic food. Hiker's are big into Max calories per ounce, and next most carbs. Hiker's also like Dollar General stores for such favorites as the 570 cal white iced honey bun, the 2/$1 fried pies at 540 calories and pop tarts at over 400 cal/pkg. But these I can easily get at Dollar General. For Berk, she could use the small size Musher's Secret pad treatment or most any dog treats. I got her a hog femur today and she wasn't too interested in it. For me, Nuun electrolyte tablets, trail mix ( Trader Joes Chocolate, Almond and Cashew are favorites) and dried fruit ( especially pineapple chunks, and for some reason Kroger or HEB is significantly better than TJ's) And if you really want to make my day, a nice maduro would be outstanding. It doesn't have to be a Presidente or Churchill, and don't blab to Libra Lady. And for meals, nothing can beat items from Packit Gourmet (Full Disclosure: I know and consider the owners friends). But don't just take my word for it. PG has won numerous awards and outstanding reviews from Backpacker magazine. Check them out at packitgourmet.comPrayer concerns 1: I learned today that Baltimore Jack passed away yesterday. He was a legend on the AT. I met him 3 times and he was always most helpful. The first meeting I was SOBO in 2009 from Pearisburg and hiking to Damascus. I received word LL had cancer and surgery was imminent. I stopped at the 1st outfitter which catered to bikers and I'll just say charitably that they weren't much help. I then stopped at Mt Rogers Outfitters where Jack was running the shop. He said they were there to help me, they'd close the shop if needed, just tell them what I needed. In 2010, I met Jack at Kincora's where he was helping Bob Peoples. Jack prepared a fabulous meal that evening. And then earlier this year I met him again in Franklin NC where he helped me in trying to get the permit for the GSMNP. Prayers for family and friends. R.I.P. JackPrayer concerns 2: Pastor Nancy is recovering from this am's surgery at Houston Methodist Hospital. Prayers for a speedy recovery I didn't do much today. Went out once for breakfast and again for dinner. The rest of the time was chugging cough syrup and got C pills. Cleaned and organized gear. Made some business calls since I had AT&T coverage for a change. And getting ready to hit the trail again tomorrow I projecting another long break from AC power. I use my phone mostly for AT map application and want to save 20% for emergency use. I then try to mark waypoints at thee d of the day, write my journal entry, and if coverage allows, post the entries. But I'm really expecting it to be quiet over the next few days due to lack of coverage. There are still a lot of hikers on the trail I case I need some assistance. So please don't get too concerned if I'm quiet for a whileTime for bedLife is good!","Atkins VA

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531737,"I thought I was getting better Thurs and was looking to get back on the trail today.... NOT. Last night was a terrible night. Still coughing and expelling gunk, still slamming Vit C and OTC cough syrup. But what was most disturbing was problems with GI and urinary tract. Fearing a UTI infection, I decided to go see a doctor. I called the pharmacyies in Marion to see if they had a ""doc in a box"". No, butt there was an Urgent Care Center at the county hospital, but it didn't open until 4 pm. That was okay as there was a 2:45 metro shuttle to town; but the last ride back left at 6:00 pm. I got there early and completed all the paperwork. I was soon seen by a NP. No strep, but BP and glucosewas over the top. Key suspect is all the corn syrup in the cough medicine I got an Rx for cough pills and just made the 6:00 metro. Had dinner with Queen Sweeper and Ungawa and now getting ready for bed<","Atkins VA

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531775,"If I thought Thurs nite was bad, it was a cakewalk compared to Fri nite. I had been chugging OTC cough and flu syrup and water to flush out all the toxins. Unfortunately, none of the water was being voided. I was in immense pain all night and finally tapped out at about 0600, calling B2 to come pick me up. I said goodbye to Ungawa and Sweeper Queen (she wanted to accompany me to hospital and I was touched, but declined her offer) Got a ride to the hospital ER from motel staff and the first order of business was to try to insert a catheter. After two attempts with two different catheters by the on duty nurse, Nurse Bruno was called in and he succeeded, Immediately drained 1200 cc's (that's 1.2 L!) The doc suggested the flu syrup as the likely culprit that caused my prostate to shut down all my plumbing. I'll be wearing a catheter for 3 more days and monitoring for 3 more after that. I'm at B2""s home and will be seriously resting over the next few days. Right now I'm about 50/50 on a decision to continue hiking or call it a year
So please hold off on mail drops for now. Thank you for all the positive thoughts and stay tuned for updates

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532800,"Went and got catheter removed Tuesday   During my down time I did a lot of thinking about future. Being the good engineer, I even prepared a decision tree. I won’t go thru all the options and factors, but let me summarize them as follows:Option 1: continue AT hike, with BerkeleyOption 1A: continue AT hike, without BerkeleyOption 2: discontinue AT hikeAfter downselecting to these three options, I then decided to eliminate one. And I was surprised at the one that was eliminated.   I decided to take Berkeley off the trail…Yes my pack was heavier because of her. And yes I had to make special arrangements for places that accommodated dogs. These weren’t factors at all in the decision. The first factor was her getting overheated. I wasn’t watching closely enough the first time she got hot, but soon learned to pay much closer attention. She has a thick, black coat, and undercoat, and was feeling the heat. And this was barely May. I’m certain July and August months would be very difficult for her at best. My biggest fear of the entire hike was her getting bit by a rattlesnake. I asked my vet 3 different times about how to treat this scenario (hoping to get a different answer) and her answer was consistent: get immediate anti-venom treatment at a vet. Her idea of “immediate” is probably along the order of a couple of hours or less. Realistic times on the AT for “immediate” is of the order of 1-3 days to get to a town, and since most of these towns do not have vet services, add another day to find a vet. And finally, if I was to become incapacitated on the trail and couldn’t take care of myself, Berk would be left on her own. However, having been raised feral this is probably not as big a concern as it would be for most other animals.So, my heart sides with Option 1A, get back on the AT, But my head says to get off the trail. I was going to wait until over this week end to make a final decision, but nobody consulted with Mr. Prostate. He didn’t step up after the catheter removal as expected and I’m now planning to return home to see a urologist.I’m sad and happy in many ways.   The sad part is not being able to complete something I started   LL says I’m stubborn as all get out, a natural Taurus. I prefer the term mental toughness. But on the positive side, I’ll get to take the granddarlings to camp at my ranch Segundo in June, hike and fish my third year with a group of friends on the CDT in July, maybe a trip to Big Bend in August and then footballs starts in Sept.   Another factor is the tremendous amount of support I’ve received from the home team. They have fully supported my efforts and have graciously offered to continue to do so. Also my ranch neighbors, Malo Hombre and PinkLady38Spcl, for watching over and caring for my property while I have been away. I’ll have another post, but right now it looks like my 2016 AT hike is over.Life is Great!","Greenville SC

Tic and Berkeley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534278,"I have written this journal entry many days ago and it has taken me a long time to post this. This is probably because it will be my last AT 2016 posting and I wanted to delay a long as possible. However, there is so much to be happy about my 2016 AT hike.   But first, let me reflect a bit on my 2009-2010 hike. One popular AT saying is “No Rain, No Pain, No Maine”.   I found that a fairly accurate description. I recall a period of 7 days of solid rain, without a tent. I got a good case of trench foot and was looking to quit around day 5.   Out of nowhere appeared a trail angel, provided some outstanding trail magic and immediately got me over my blue mood. Later, I had a cyst on my shoulder “explode” and that led to some painful surgery at a “doc-in-the-box facility.   Fortunately, trail angel St Thomas helped me out of this situation. But the one pain I couldn’t overcome was breaking two ribs, 40 miles into the 100 Mile Wilderness. I did hike another 20 miles but realized my helpless situation. I called for help and had a Maine Game Warden help me get off the trail. Other excitement included stepping over the largest timber rattlesnake I’ve ever seen and almost “running” off a ledge over a 1000’ drop, only to jump and land on a lone pine tree. So the challenges this year were not all that unexpected.   Rain, no problem, its going to happen. Pain, yes. My feet hurt and overall body takes much more time to recover from the exertion. I lost 21 lbs in less than 2 months on the trail; Berkeley lost 4. That’s all part of the hike. However, two trips to the ER and persistent prostrate issues have caused me to return home. I see an urologist next week for treatment.But, here are some of positive takes from my 2016 hike:First, I was thrilled to see two hikers from 2009. First was Red Hat, who I met on my worst day in 2009, day 5 into 7 days of rain. She was from Brenham TX and recently moved close to the AT and was working at the Hiker’s Ridge Ministries Resource Center in Hot Springs NC. She recognized me right away. Next was Geo, who I met at one of the shelters. I didn’t remember him, but he remembered me from Shaw’s Hiker Hostel in Monson, ME. He was with Tater Chip, who I remembered being from the Dallas areaNext, I was most pleased to stay at several places that I had previously visited and these really support AT hikers. The first was with Ron Haven’s Budget Inn in Franklin NC. Besides Ron, I was also able to meet Baltimore Jack who was working at local outfitters there. Sadly, Jack recently passed away. Next, I stayed at the Greasy Creek Friendly Hostel with CeCe Pruitt. I had stayed there in 2010 and also took a picture of MissStep’s (more on her later) floor tile. Finally, I stayed at Kincora’s, owned by Bob Peoples. Bob has done more for the AT than probably the next 10 people combined. Bob has 17 cats, a couple of coons and a fox that he takes care of and doesn’t want dogs at his hostel. He made an exception for Berkeley and me and we behaved nicely. Also, it was nice to see my 2010 “thank you” cards prominently displayed at Ron and Bob’s places.I was 63 years old when I hiked the AT in 2009 and a favorite hiker was MissStep, nee Fluffy Bunny. She was special in that she was 21, 1/3 my age at the time. My goal this year was to find a hiker ¼ my age, as I just recently turned 70. And that hiker was Beaver, who is 17. I feel pretty good keeping up with these youngsters. And a good friend complimented me on my graceful aging. To heck with that, I want to go out kicking and screaming!The hike this year was most satisfying. The weather was mostly favorable. The coldest night was barely a week into the hike at Tray Mtn. The temp got down to 14 deg with 55 mph winds. I also had several cold, snowy days with high winds in the Smokies as well. And only 2 days of rain until the last week of hiking. The rest of the hike was gorgeous. I enjoyed hiking with Berkeley and she was quite well behaved, despite numerous confrontations with “friendly, uncontrolled, loose dogs” There are a lot of hikers I met this year. Too many to identify by name, and many others, I either never learned their names or soon forgot. They will always be remembered fondly. And there were new hostels I visited this year: Top of Georgia and Vango Abby.And some final words of thanks. First, thanks to God for the beautiful creation! We did a lot of talking during this hike, and it was a lot more than “Help me over this next hill.” Thanks for watching over and protecting me. I’m also thankful to be an American.   I can’t say that I enjoy the current political situation; but there is no other place that I would rather be, enjoying all our freedoms. Thanks to the ATC and all the affiliate clubs that service and maintain the trails, for without them there would be no AT. Thanks to all the trail angels that provided trail magic, offered rides and all other assistance that make hiking a much more tolerable undertaking. Thanks to all the hikers I met who shared the trails and helped out each other. Thanks to Trail Journal readers, who supported me and hiked vicariously with me. Thanks to my prayer warriors at church and friends. Thanks to my neighbors for watching over my house and the ranch. And finally, thanks to B2 for all his Ground Control support, including my medevac, and Libra Lady for encouraging and supporting me in all my endeavors.It was a great hike and life is still good!","Greenville, SC
