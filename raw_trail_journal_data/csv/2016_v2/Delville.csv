Delville,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538326,"My Daughter Luigi has been hiking since April 6. Her mom and I are joining her for about 9 days starting 6/17/16. The backpack is full and currently weighs 35 Pounds but that is without water. Her moms bag is at 21. We are extremely excited!! The goal obviously is to not hold her up on her 2180 mile trip so maybe we will leave earlier than her each day. I teasingly say to her I hope you can keep up with me but I'm 62 and she is 30. I told her my trail name will be Daddy Lightning but we shall see. I don't want to be Daddy Turtle. I will be joining her in Daleville, Va which is at about 727.5 mile mark.",,"About to Start in Dalville, Va","Jun 15, Wed",0
Delville,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538447,"Tomorrow Tammy and I fly into Charlottesville and will rent a car to take us to Dalville to pick up our daughter Tracy,Luigi to spend a night in a hotel in Roanoke. I will only have the car for one day before we drop it off and start our trail adventures.   Today I flew to Atlanta to visit our first grand child Quentin born the first of April.   We are treating Luigi to a night in a real bed and taking her out to dinner. A couple of other thru hikers we will drive to town also. Rambler and ??   We are glad she has met up and traveled with some others.   How will we do? Who knows but we are excited. From others we get a mixture of opinions and thoughts. Some say how cool, and others say that is crazy. I have read a lot on how to pack a tent and what all to expect.   Luigi though is our best source of info.    Certainly our prides will help push us each day. Hopefully there will be no blisters.   ","About to Start in Dalville, Va

Delville,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538614,"We met Rambler, Luigi and Slug as they exited the trail in Daleville, Va. They hiked about 15 miles today to get here    It was good to see Tracy having such great traveling companions. We treated them to our room at a Super 8 where they got showers, washed their clothes and then we went to eat ai chilpolte. The next stop was a resupply at Walmart. Ok so not roughing it yet but it does start tomorrow after we drop off the car.   It is a late night tonight.","About to Start in Dalville, Va

Delville,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538963,"Day 1 9 miles. Day 2 10 miles. Day 3 10 miles.   Here are my general comments.   Goin up is tough on the Breath, going down is tough on the knees and tows.   You wish you were 50 pounds lighter and with the 40 pounds in my pack it is a big haul.   Level and slightly down are the best. I have been called Pack Mule because of all the crazy extra weight items I have brought. You can search for Luigi journal to get an idea.   My wife Tammy has not been named yet but she is doing great.   Today we went to a campground and they had showers and laundry and a tv for Movies room. We are camping here    Night one was actually cold and my thin silk sheet with no sleeping bag kept me cold. Night 2 was a little warmer.   Tomorrow we may find out what yellow blazing is as they are climbing straight up big hills and we don't want to hold them up.   No blisters no soreness so all is well.    We are having a great time","heading north
