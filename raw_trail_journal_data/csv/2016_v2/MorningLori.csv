MorningLori,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/484312,"So, many people ask why.... There really isn't a clear answer. There is just something about the idea of being unfettered. To have no responsibilities beyond meeting my own basic needs.I have dreamed of hiking the trail since I was a little girl. The AT went through the four corners of Blanchard ME and there was a hostel called the Cross Roads. We would go there with my Dad who knew the owners Herb & June and play outside on the lawn. Most of the hikers were young men only a little more than 100 miles from reaching their goal. I was too shy to talk to them so I spent my time watching and listening to their conversations. I was fascinated by their sense of calm/peace... They had nothing but what they could carry on their backs and didn't seem to have a care in the world. Food, water, shelter... Everything else was something to enjoy and celebrate IF it came their way. That is one of many reasons why I am going to hike the trail. Everyone has their own reasons. Most, like me, have a multitude of undefinable reasons to make this journey, or any other journey that calls to them....",,View Entry,"Aug 16, Sat",0
MorningLori,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/484314,"I am preparing to hike the 100- mile wilderness and am surprised at how nervous I am about it. Not so much about the things that most people would think a woman hiking alone would be, but more about the logistics and physicality of the hike. This will be my longest hike to date and I am feeling like it will be good predictor of my thru hiking success or failure in 2016.... Norman is doing much better with his pack and I have packed and unpacked my pack what feels like a hundred times. My pack weight with 9 days of food and 32 oz of water is just under 30 lbs. I am concerned about having enough food and fuel for my stove, hiking 8-12 miles a day for 9 days straight, being prepared for the weather- heat, cold, rain...",,View Entry,"Sep 02, Tue",0
MorningLori,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/484315,My backpack is packed for the final time and comes in at just under 30 lbs.-The best part is it will get lighter every day AND Norman is carrying all 9 days of his own food- his pack weighs just under 9 lbs with his bowl and some treats. My anxiety has become excitement and I am looking forward to being inspired by the thru hikers I will meet that are only days from reaching Katahdin.,,View Entry,"Sep 04, Thu",0
MorningLori,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/484316,"I was just reading my journal from my hike through the 100 mile wilderness. It truly was an amazing journey and I learned a lot about myself, hiking in general, & Norman's special needs as we hiked. First of all, I need to set realistic goals for myself. If not, I push myself to hard. I set a fairly aggressive schedule to finish in 10 days, & then had to finish in 9. I felt like I was obsessing over the schedule when I should've been focused on the beauty that I was surrounded by everyday (even in the rain). A mile on the AT is not the same as a mile walking in the AM before work! I need to pack more protein so that I will have the muscle strength & energy to hike all day. The number of miles hiked in a day is not necessarily an indicator of how hard a day was. 
For us lady hikers, pay attention to wind direction when using your p-style. Norman needs clothing to protect him from the elements. He has very short fur and got cold easily. He also seemed to have some sort of reaction to his pack. I ended up carrying it for most of the 9 days.That is about it for the more technical aspects of my hike. I will post soon about some of my experiences & people that I met in the 100-mile wilderness.",,View Entry,"Sep 18, Thu",0
MorningLori,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/484317,"While out on our nine day adventure we saw a lot of people. I didn't get to talk to many because Norman (AKA Noodles) did not encourage polite conversation. At best people received 'the look' at worst growling and grumbling. In spite of this I did talk to some interesting and inspiring people. There was Short Stop who was finishing his 2nd thru hike. He was a veteran who was hoping to summit on September 11th. He will be turning 70 in October. His advise to me was to take it slow in GA. He started on March 6 pushed to hard and was off the trail for a couple weeks with an injury. He also says "" age is just a number and you are as YOUNG as you feel. I also met a younger girl solo hiking with her dog. She was flip flopping- she hiked from GA to NJ took a month or so off and had had just restarted in ME and was hiking to her home state of NJ. Her dog had not hiked the entire trail with her, only sections...Turtle Tracks was a trail angel that I met when I needed it the most. It was raining & cold. Norman & I were soaked through and he was just setting up for the weekend to feed the thru hikers as the neared their goal. He had attempted to thru hike in 2012 & 2013. But he just took to much time. He loved every moment on the trail. Hike Your Own Hike... That was the best banana & Pepsi I have ever had and they gave me enough energy and motivation to get to chair back pond where we camped for the night.Every person on the trail has a story. I was honored to talk to these three people specifically. I wish I had spoken to more of the hikers along the way, but I might not have made it to Monson in time",,View Entry,"Sep 23, Tue",0
MorningLori,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/484318,"I love the smell of the forest. When I am hiking I can smell the different trees with their own individual scents. We all know the smell or pine and fir, but the maple, oak, birch, fir, beach, and poplar have their own distinct smells. The smells change with the weather as well as the season, after the rain the smells are clean and light and in the fall the smells become more earthy and heavy.

I still marvel that I have chosen to do something so huge for MYSELF. I struggle a little with the selfish nature of my choice, not as much a I would have expected though. Maybe I am rationalizing, I believe I will be a better person, more of an asset to my family, when I return. I am so thankful that my husband has accepted my choice. I think about the potential emotional, physical, and financial ramifications and have to remind myself we only get one chance to live this life. None of us knows when or how our lives, our journeys, will unfold. I have grown and changed just in the planning.

I convinced my 24 year old son to spend his weekend hiking with me. We had a great time! We started out on Saturday hiking up the Notch Trail, through the Mahoosuc Notch, up the Mahoosuc Arm, then down to Speck Pond for supper. Boy was it a challenging day of hiking. It took us 2 hours to get through the Notch, which wasn't to bad, but boy did I struggle UP the Arm- It felt like the climb went on forever! We stealth camped a little past the lean to and got back to the car around 11 am and took my Tracker exploring.Tim notices the neatest things like pine needle fossils in the rocks, underground streams, ice in August... I think he enjoyed it too. I loved the challenge and adventure but most of all spending time with Tim",,Mahoosuc Notch,"Aug 30, Sun",0

I am REALLY working on relaxing and enjoying myself. That said, There was the most amazing trail magic at Flagstaff lake. Cheeseburger and soda for supper and I am staying here for the night so they are feeding me breakfast too!! I was hearing about the trail magic all day and I know it got me a lot further- My first day out and already I am pushing further for food lol. Norman is not carrying any of his own supplies and seems to be doing much better than last year in the 100 mile wilderness.

Just day two and I have met two amazing female hikers. Tiny Giant was with the trail magic group. She thru hiked last year and is really missing the trail. I was amazed at how similar we are... But maybe I shouldn't be, we both have the same dream... I also met Bookie and No Shame, a woman who is thru hiking this year with her dog. What an inspiration! She has some miles to make up after she summits, but I have no doubt she will be successful. I knew of her from a facebook page that we are both members of. The weather was good today, but looks like rain for tomorrow and Monday... Should be an adventure. Short miles planned so we can take it slow. I will miss the views from Avery and West peaks.

I'm not sure what the temperature was, but it was a good reminder of how easily hypothermia can happen! While I was hiking I was fine, but when I got to the road I stopped to call the hotel for the shuttle (no answer-they where out picking up other hikers) I started shaking and had a hard time using my phone. I started walking to town and poor Norman was NOT happy. He kept trying to go to peoples houses along the way... I could just hear him thinking- ""That house looks nice and dry, lets stop there"". A lovely trail angel, Pam, stopped and picked us up. We were soaking wet. Norman proceeded to roll around in the back seat to dry himself off! Way to say thanks Norman. When we got to town we did laundry, got clean, dry, and warm. I went to the grocery store to pick up a few supplies and when I came out I saw our very good friends Glen and Kristy! What a crazy coincidence! They offered to buy me a hot meal but I was full from the Spagettios that I had just eaten.

We are stealth camping on an old road a little past Crocker Cirque Campsite. Have a short day planned tomorrow that should give us time to go to the summit of Sugarloaf.I fell and hit my head/face today-coming down the South side of Crocker- I am not sure what caused the fall, but I landed hard on my forehead and nose right onto the rocks. I landed so hard that I flipped onto my back, it almost felt like I 'bounced'. My face is a mess, but I seem to be fine... I am feeling pretty humble and hoping it heals well before Saturday morning. John already worries so much...Why does that (not so) little voice that tells me I don't belong out here pop into my head the minute things do not go as planned???

Norman is pretty tuckered out. he is growling and barking at everyone and in general being a pain... The climb up the north side of Sugarloaf from the river was rugged. I am so thankful that we were going UP after yesterday I am pretty nervous of the steep downs. We seem to be reaching our daily destination around 3-3:30. It seems so early but I think it is all Norman (and I) has in him. Tomorrow looks to be an easier 8 mile day, but Friday is looking pretty tough.

I have made some major changes in my gear and diet. Having protein at every lunch has helped a lot. When I get home I am going to make some water bottle holders for my pack. The elastics on the pack straps work ok, but the bottles fall out when I bend over or remove my pack. I think I am running out of stove fuel, hopefully I have enough to last through supper tomorrow night.I am looking forward to seeing John on Saturday.

Then came the news from home. My father in law is not doing well and Lydia our other dog is not eating. I know that everything happens for a reason, but wow is it hard to be away from home when things are not going well. I considered taking the trail down from saddleback to the ski area and having a friend pick me up to head home a day early, but after talking to my husband and sister in law I decided to continue as planned.

MorningLori,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517834,"I am truly blessed. My life is not perfect and never has been.I grew up in a small fishing village in Maine and have known hard work from a very young age. My sisters and I (and eventually my little brother, there are five of us) took turns working as sternmen on the lobster boats of my Dad, Grandfather, and cousin. Lobstering is hard work for anyone, and I can tell you my Dad did not cut us a break because we were girls. I also worked in his shop building lobster traps, shucking scallops, and picking pogies (greasy smelly fish used for lobster bait) out of gill nets (sounds glamorous right  ). My Mom taught me that if something needed doing - do it. You didn't complain or wait for someone else to do it for you. She also taught me that being quite does not mean you are weak and to choose my battles that I am willing to fight to the end. When money was really tight we stood in line for the government cheese, peanut butter, and oatmeal. Many of our neighbors stood in the same line. I did not know how poor we were until I went to high school. Through it all my Dad instilled a love and respect for the natural world. After all that is what fed our family. My parents scrimped and saved to buy our camp which eventually inspired this dream to hike the AT.I am truly thankful for the hard work and hard times that have molded me into the person I am today.",,Thankful,"Nov 29, Sun",0

It got down to 20 degrees and I stayed warm all night. I did have to get up at 2 to take Norman inside. He was sleeping under my quilt with me and was causing a big air gap that was letting the cold air in (not to mention the extra condensation inside the tent). He has his own bag, but preferred mine, lol. The temps have risen to the 30's at night here, so I will wait for a single digit night to do another test. Since I have never hiked in Georgia in March I am asking other hikers for their experiences. So far I have heard anything from 4 - 80 degrees for temps and as much as a foot + of snow (not long lasting) and to expect ice.

The fields were broken up by some wooded areas which helped to break up the day.
