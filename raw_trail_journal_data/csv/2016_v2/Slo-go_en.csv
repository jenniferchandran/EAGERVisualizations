Slo-go'en,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526252,"I haven't done a Trail Journal for a few years. I was surprised I actually remembered my pass word! Last year (2015) I went to Harpers Ferry for the May 1st Flip-flop kick off at the ATC, but hiked south to Daleville, VA. The year before (2014)I hiked from Marion, VA to Daleville and the year before that (2013) I hiked Springer to Marion. So, everything south of HF has been done, for the 3d time and some of those stretches for the 4th or 5th time. I figure that over the years, I have hiked about 6200 miles of the AT. So, it's time to head north from Harpers Ferry again and complete the trail north for the 3d time.Therefore, I'll be heading down to Harpers Ferry for this years ATC Flip flop kick off on April 17. I'll head north with 20 or 30 others and hope to hike as far as Mount Adams in the White Mountains of NH. Once I get to Mt Adams, I can take a 3.5 mile side trail and walk to my front door! So I will be literally be ""walking home"". Sounds like fun.   ",,Time for another long hike,"Apr 03, Sun",0

Slo-go'en,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526387,"When it starts to get wicked hot in the afternoon, it's a good idea to stop and rest for a while. The problem is, just sitting around at a random spot on the trail for a few hours isn't too exciting, so I just slow down to a crawl and keep going. I decided on this trip I'll try something different. I bought the lightest, smallest, cheapest hammock I could find, a one pound ""Grand Tuck"". So, now when it gets beastly hot in the afternoon, I can simply string up the hammock and take a siesta for a few hours. Once it cools off later on, I'll put in the rest of the days miles. I really like hiking in the evening anyway, so this might work out nicely. Last year when I started from Harpers Ferry May 1st it was very hot. It eventually cooled down a little but the first 2 weeks were really steamy. That's when I got this idea of using a hammock for afternoon siesta's. I don't like using a hammock for my primary shelter. To be effective in all weather conditions you really need to much extras to keep it dry and warm. So, my primary shelter will be the Six Moon Designs ""Gatewood Cape"" and ""Serenity"" net. Since I'll be going NOBO from Harpers Ferry starting the middle of April, the shelters should be pretty empty of people but possibly full of biting bugs. Having the serenity net to set up in a shelter for an escape from Black Flies in Vermont should be a sanity saver!",,Random thoughts,"Apr 04, Mon",0

Hard to believe it's not even May yet. The trail tread alternated between easy woods road and ankle twisty rocks, which we usually on the down hill sections. I guess it's getting us used to what PA will be like. We seemed to have lost about half the group which left HF yesterday to a campground six miles back which has pizza delivery. A few New faces here at this shelter, those who started the day before. Most are tenting but I'm being lazy and using the shelter.

Then one more FF hiker caught up to us. Rummer has it 100 hammock hangers will be at the Pine Grove Furnace State park tomorrow, which is where we will be too. Could be interesting.

Slo-go'en,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536467,Mt Alto 13.7 miles Had a hard time getting to sleep the tooth root under an old cap is starting to root away and getting sensitive. Brushing and a few aspirin helped. Got some over the counter novacane today if It gets bad. Meet a hiker today who recognized me from 1988 when we spent some time hiking together through VA. What are the chances? Rain cleared up over night and was a misty morning giving the woods a surreal look. New England woods look real dark and spooky at times in the right light. Mostly easy trail today with a few stiff climbs as usual to keep us in shape. And just as it got hot and sticky in the afternoon. I went to town Kent CT after arriving at the shelter to resupply as I'm out of everything. Had dinner too but hard to eat a big meal when all you want to do is go to sleep.,"

Slo-go'en,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536468,Caeser campsite 13 miles. Hot today in the 80's. I blue blazed by doing the road walk along the river instead of doing a nasty and pointless climb over a ridge. I got to the same place hours earlier then everyone else. That gave me time to sit and enjoy the river to soak my feet. Stuart Hollow shelter had what looked to be another homeless couple camping there. I doubt they do much hiking. I got to Silver hill campsite well before eight-thirty so strung a line and dried all my damp stuff out. Nice campsite with a cooking pavilion and a swinging bench. But when eight-thirty did show up we moved on to this site but had to do the big climbs during the heat of the afternoon. One woman here with a dog then three thru hikers rolled in just before dusk. Memorial day weekend coming up and we'll be in a high usage area. Fun you bet,"

Slo-go'en,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536469,Bearded woods hostel 11 milesHot hot day. NASCAR race track in valley was in full swing for the holiday weekend and was very loud and annoying. We heard them for miles and miles which ment for hours. Deciding to come here today instead of Tomorrow was a good idea as the next shelter would be in ear shot of the race track and would have been a bear of a hike in the afternoon heat. Full house here tonight lucky there was room for eight-thirty and me.,"

Slo-go'en,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536470,"Riga shelter 11.7 milesWe were woken up by the slack packing couple Rocket and Princess at 4:30 AM who then spent the next hour fiddling with their gear in the bunk room keeping us awake. Since they claimed to want an early start you'd think they would have gotten everything ready to go the night before. In the end they stayed for breakfast served at 6:30 and didn't get out until the rest of us at 7. So much for getting us all up so early. Just one of the down sides to staying at a hostel. We got on the trail about 7:30 just as it was warming up. The trail took us along the Housatonic abd the falls which were reasonably impressive. Then a slow climb up and along a ridge through nice forest finishing with a very steep decent. Along the way Bookworm and Lemon caught up to us. We hadn't seen them since Graymoor in NY. We all went to town (Salisbury) and spent way too much on food. It's amazing how quick that can add up. The about 2 , in the peak of the heat of the afternoon we started the last 4 miles android a 1000 foot climb. This being the holiday weekend the site is busy. Well after eight-thirty and I set up tents a group showed up and claimed we were in a group site and set up all around us. No clear signs designating this as a group site and all the solo sites full so nothing can be done but put up with it. But to take a group to a popular site on a holiday weekend and show up late is just inconsiderate. Tomorrow we get to MA and another popular site so might also be nuts there too. Black Flies starting to become annoying now that the summer heat is in full swing, 90's and humid. Hope this doesn't last long!","

Another hot and humid day. It was slow hiking with the heat and steep climbs up the three mountains we had to do today. I took several tumbles on rocks slick from condensation and hidden by leads. No injures though. I wasn't the only one to fall down today either. Several ridgerunners on the trail today along with a number of the holiday odd balls, like the group hiking out of Sage Ravine with everything in their hands note one pack between them and everything but actual camping gear.Sage Ravine and Race Mt are the high lights of this section and quite interesting. It took eight-thirty and me 9 hours to hike 10 miles due to the difficulty of the climbs and the heat requiring us to take many breaks. Just five in the shelter tonight one SOBO section hikers and two other flip flippers. Tropical storm coming up the coast apparently which could affect our weather.","

Slo-go'en,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536475,Tom Leonard shelter 10 milesRain early morning so late start waiting it out. Tappered off about 7. Slick rocks from the rain made the insanely steep decent off of Jug end very treacherous and very slow. My Vasque boots never were good on wet rock and now that they are near the end of their life are very dangerous. But managed to get down without incident. It took a long time to hitch into Great Barrington most of the traffic was out of state cars going too fast. An hour later I finally got a ride with a trail maintainer. I had him take me to the price chopper market at the north end of town. There I finally got more data time for the Tracfone along with food for the next leg. Getting back was quicker on RT 23 but this put me 2 miles north of the shelter I wanted to be at so had to hike south. We're having our first serious thunderstorm tonight glad to be in a shelter although it seems a porkiepine has been eating it lately.,"

Slo-go'en,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536476,"Shaker campsite 10 milesThe porkie didn't vist last night maybe the thunder storm kept it away. The storm did clear the air and made it a much more pleasant day then it has been since the heat wave started back in CT. So it was a nice day to hike although we are still taking our time, going little more then 1 MPH on average. It's a diverse area with farm land, ponds , woods, bogs, crazy rocks and steep trail. Eight-thirty and I are the only ones at this site. Four thru hikers passed us today on their way to upper goose pond, where we will be tomorrow. Everyone has little red welts over any exposed skin due to black flies the last few days. The cooler and less humid air today has keeped the flies at bay but the mosquitos are also comming out big time now. 500 miles along and getting a little sore around the edges. Feet holding up but a little sore at the end of the day, which is to be expected. My right foot doesn't fit the boot real well and is the one which suffers. The knees don't like the long steep descents. They don't have the spring they to have years ago anymore. But tonight is the kind of night we spend time in the woods and makes any hardship worth it.","

Slo-go'en,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537570,"Bascom lodge , Mt Graylock 17 milesSpent last night in Dalton at the Shamrock motel. I took another shower before leaving, what the heck. Breakfast begal at the coffee shop. Not too bad a hike despite all the uphill. At least not much was rock climbs or too steep. Had a hot dog and some ice cream at a little place the trail passes in Cheshire. Who could resist? Not many on the trail today. A few day hikers and a couple of weekender backpackers. Eight-thirty stayed in town to take a zero so I might not see him again. I decided to stay at the Bascom lodge at the summit of Graylock instead of the shelter three miles south. This was because of rain and thunderstorms predicted for most of tomorrow. $44 with tax for a berth in the bunk house. I'm the only one in a room for 12 so pretty lucky it's not a full house or getting sleep would be next to impossible. Fantastic Sun set from the summit even if fore tells the rain tomorrow. The dinning area is busy here as there was a Willimstown collage graduation. They needed to quiet down soon.","

Waited out the rain in the morning which ended as scheduled at 9 AM. Reached town about 1 and walked half mile in wrong direction for the supermarket. Back on the trail about 2 when it started to rain. Not bad at first but turned into tropical down pour. Got soaking wet. Trial turned into a muddy river in places. Too much for the boots to handle and they filled with water. At the shelter found three girls already here with wet stuff all over the place. They are just starting out on way north. Then one more woman shows up so It's me and four girls. Rain is ending we get one good day tomorrow..,"

An older guy who was camped behind the shelter gave me his DryDucks rain jacket as he had a spare and was cutting the hike short. Not having a shell was becoming a liability so this will solve the problem. Once the sky cleared it was a nice day to hike. The trail pretty easy or me finally getting trail legs and hiking on familiar ground. A sunny spot on the trail about noon allowed drying the tent while eating. Great views from Glassenbury fire tower. Very windy at the top though. New faces at the shelter which is full. Mostly LT hikers starting out.,"

Slo-go'en,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537574,"Stratton pond 10.4 milesThe day started out cold and it wasn't until 7 that I got up so late start. The walk towards Stratton was easy and not too muddy. Nearing the summit, it started to drizzle and then enough to put on the rain jacket. Finally made the summit and climbed the tower just as the rain was becoming heavy. It got very windy the higher up the tower I climbed. Then the storm really hit with hail mixed in with the driving wind. Fortunately the platform was glassed in so I was protected from the worst of it. Turned out to be good timing. I was able to get a few text messages out which has been difficult the last few days due to spotty coverage. By then the worst of the storm passed and I continued north and down the mountain and to the shelter. Lots of hikers here tonight. Some SOBO, a group of 5 thru hikers , the most we've seen in one group so far and first to be seen in a few days. Where have all the chipmunks gone ? It seems that since leaving Connecticut I haven't seen many. They are usually all over the forest. I'm in the tent as it will be warmer and quieter then the shelter crowded.   Unfortunately will have wet tent in the morning.","
