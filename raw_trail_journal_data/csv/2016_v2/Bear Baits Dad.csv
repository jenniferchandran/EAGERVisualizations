Bear Baits Dad,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534142,"Just getting started and spending a 4 day weekend hiking with my son Bear Bait to try out the equipment, and allow my 13yo to wander the AT, see streams and hills, and wildlife along the way. 
We left the truck at Gravel Springs and hired a ride to Big Meadows. Raining all the way and foggy/clouds blowing through. We filled out our permit and hit the trail and the sun came out and we had great views. This was just a short hike as we drove in today.
Stayed at Rock Springs Hut which was a first for us. Met some really nice hikers staying in hammocks, tents, and in the hut. Shared the hut with a dozen mice that wandered the rafters and teh sleeping platform all night, but that didn't matter with the fresh cold spring time air flowing through.
temperature was in the 20s but we were plenty warm. Spring was piped. i think we brought too much food and clothing. Pack weight was 38 lbs for me and 18 for him.","Big Meadows

Bear Baits Dad,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534145,"Got an early start with the first light. Bear Bait took a side trail to explore and met some deer up close. As he was returning a young bobcat scampered through the woods, across the trail, and into a rock lined cave. Respecting that mamma might be in there he stopped filming and slowly left the area. What a great start to the day!
Oatmeal breakfast at an overlook, and burger and fries for lunch at Skyland lodge. Hiked the side trail to the overlook just north of Skyland, then on we went. Discovered that we hadn't refilled our water so we were thirsty for a bit. Got water at the Picnic Area and continued on. We passed the pinnacle and wanted to make it to the next hut but he felt sick and i was starting to stumble a bit, so we pitched our tent to the side of the trail a distance under an old apple tree, discovered it was difficult to throw a bear bag with too much food up over a high branch when we are exhausted (but we made it,) and then we got a great nights sleep with no one snoring nearby. Totally silent except for a bird that would dive on our tent, and the noisy train that rumbled through to the west of the mountains every couple of hours.
A nice day on the trails. sunny. We DO have way too much food and it cant be simmered in our type of heating pot and the cozy doesn't keep it hot enough long enough. But we are here to test things out and we are learning!","Rock Spring Hut

Bear Baits Dad,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534152,"Woke early, broke camp, ruffled the leaves back up under the tent and left no traces. Discovered we were less than half a mike from the hut, and that hut had a fireplace inside. Oh well, it was perfectly quiet and we feel very well rested. Off to an early start. 
Breakfast from an overlook. The fire house sirens were whaling this morning and we think we could see a barn burning in the distance. Its like being in a fire tower up here looking down on a number of towns.
Great Easter Views from Mary's Rock. Missed being home today. Had some elevation and drops. Day three is the sorest for my muscles so far. Neither of us have blisters or sores so we are doing well. Heavy backpacks.
Had a feat at Pass Mountain Hut in the foggy clouds that are blowing through. Really damp but we are dry and body heat keeps our clothes dry. 
Met Mosey Breaker Breaker 19 or just Mosey for short who wanders the USA, has bycycled from Vermont to Florida, spent time in Utah, and has decided to hike the Appalachian trail this year. We really enjoyed his perspectives. We discussed how much one will work to buy 'things' and not get the right amount of time to spend with the kiddos, or even to enjoy the things that are purchased. I see this so much in the NJ neighborhoods near me where everyone is rushing around and many never get time to actually enjoy the things they are rushing around to do. This is a wonderful break from that environment.
We wished Mosey well at hiker midnight (8pm) and all went to sleep as the clouds brought darkness.","Pinnacle

Bear Baits Dad,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534153,"Woke early and hiked more miles today. Almost all ridge-lines. Realized how the ridge lines are composed of a layer of rocks at almost the same angle along these faults. Bear Bait is studying these in school so we took a few pictures. He has a test on these on Tuesday in science class. Several of the pinnacles that we crossed yesterday were composed chiefly of limestone type materials and water was more scarce as it would simply run through. There were large pockets in the earth which I imagine are from slight cave ins from underlying waterways. Not something that i want to walk through.
Today, by contrast we are on dark brown rich hummas type soil with lots of blow down trees in some areas, plenty of streams, and lots of ridge-lines. Making good time but only have till mid day as we need to travel home today. 
Too much food and too much clothing. Hitched a ride to the truck from Elk Wallows. Elk Wallows wayside was closed so the hamburger will have to wait.
A beautiful long weekend in the park! I need to do this monthly to get back in shape. Sore but not as much as day 3.","Pass Mountain Hut

Bear Baits Dad,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555718,"Toured Harpers Ferry and met some great volunteer workers. What a great restored town. It's definitely worth spending a couple of hours here. There is food and there is a supply store for the AT.Hiked along the river, railway, and canal path for a couple miles then up where we had some views. Maine here we come! Had our pictures taken at the conservancy. We are northbound hikers number 9 and 10.This is the first leg of our trip to Maine. We are weekenders until Jonathan's school gets out.","harpers ferry

Bear Baits Dad,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555724,Crampton Gap is a nice shelter on the smaller side compared to the magnificent ones that are on either side of this shelter. At night when Jonathan shined his light into the spring there were a ton of worms that sought the light. Possibly pin worms. It might be worth gettting water elsewhere.9 degrees F in the am. Slept with our water bottles in the sleeping bag. Our equipment kept us warm. I need to replace my 6 lb sleeping bag now that I have a light backpack.We will look back on this cold hike in the summer with envy toward the cooler environment I am sure.Beautiful sunrise from the shelter and walk in the am. Ate breakfast at the next shelter which is a beautiful structure. Met some fun intellegent folks hiking the trail today. Lots of local folks and dogs too.This whole area is fulll of history. You will walk through many battle sites. We layed down and rested where two generals from opposing sides died.Stopped at the Washington monument and used UBER to come back to our truck.,"Crampton Gap

Bear Baits Dad,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557903,Beautiful wand much warmer hike past Annapolis rocks where there must have been 20 rock climbers working their way along the edges. 75 degrees after some cold hikes made this an enjoyable day. Big right turn and drop over to Ensign Cowall Shelter. Tented because boy scouts were using the shelter. A fair amount of road sounds here. Looking forward to the up at Ravens Rock tomorrow and the PA border.,"Washington Monument

Bear Baits Dad,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557904,"Plenty of water and some nice stream crossings. I had promised JB that he would be able to have streams to cross along the way as he hiked and there have been relatively few so far. Cool and cloudy all day with clouds drifting across the trail and water dripping from the trees.Large up to Ravens Rock. These rocks protrude from the mountain and are so big. Sleeted on us a bit but the temperature was between 40 and 45F today. Big down from there and into PenMar and right to the border. Met our first lost hiker who was hiking along with us with a destination of Harpers Ferry. When we looked at his map I stated that he will need a new map soon, as he is walking off of the top of the map into Pennsylvania. He asked where Harpers Ferry was, and that is when he realized that he had been hiking north for half a day instead of South. I encouraged him to walk the extra half of a mile so he could say that he hiked from PA to Harpers but he was a little concerned about making his destination to Ravens Roost.","Ensign Cowall
