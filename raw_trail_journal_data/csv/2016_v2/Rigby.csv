Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522399,"Last week, I had the distinct honor of resigning from my job 4 times in one day. It was the best day ever. It also means that I can't back out of my AT Thru-hike because I don't have a normal, stable life to fall back on anymore...I have one of those weird ambiguous jobs where I work for a lot of different people in lots of different departments and also for no one boss in particular, which makes it stupendously complicated to do things like take a sick day or quit in a fit of rage (Come to think of it, that may be by design). Of course, this wasn't a fit of rage quit and storm out situation- in fact, this was the best planned ""Eff this, I'm out"" moment of my adult life. And that's coming from someone with A LOT of those moments in her personal history. I've been planning my AT Thru Hike since early October and had all the details nailed down ages ago (Note: By ""all the details"" I mean that I picked a start date and bought some trail mix, but I'm sure everything will be fine), but I was terrified to quit my job in case, I don't know, someone got mad and keyed my car or something. Plus, once I no longer had a job, this plan was really real and I couldn't back out or say ""maybe next year"" again.The word had gotten out amongst the endlessly gossipy nurses (mad love, RN friends, but you know it's true)- mostly because I told several of them, so this is really on me- and it was only a matter of time before it got back to one of the many powers that be. Stomach in knots, sweating profusely, I marched from office to office- ""hey, can I talk to you for a minute?"" ""Oh no, are you quitting?""""Um, yeah, but not because I found a new job, if that makes it any better.""To my immense relief, every manager I talked to was thrilled for me! I resigned in person to all three department heads (and their assistant managers, who happened to be around at the time), answered the requite ""Bears? Gun? Tent? But, food?"" questions I've become accustomed to, then formally resigned via email, just for good measure. My job is posted on the company HR site and we've received 4 resumes in 3 days. I gotta say, I immediately felt ten pounds lighter. Quitting my job has been the hardest part of the process to date, but here I am, all quitted up, and ready to hike. Now, I just have to walk 2189 miles and I'll have this absurd thru-hike notion all wrapped up.Let's do this.",,The Guest Bedroom at my Parent's House,"Mar 03, Thu",0
Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522403,"The first couple of days after my thru-hike plans became common knowledge, I was inundated with more questions than I could have possibly imagined. Some of them I expected, others... well, I'm still recovering from the shock of some of the weirder questions. I got tired of answering them really quickly, because I'm shy and awkward and get pretty tired of most conversations pretty fast, so I figured I'd just answer all the questions here, then hand out the URL to every casual acquaintance who asks me about my period or the ratio of carbs to fat in the average thru-hiker's diet.So, without further ado, FAST FAQS:1. Aren't you scared?No, not a chance. Just Kidding.Of course I am. Are you insane? I'm quitting my job and selling my belongings and will be living in the forest for six months, like some deranged racoon with a probable drinking problem. Anyone who says they aren't scared is a dirty liar. That being said, no, I'm not scared of thunder storms or bears or serial killers. I cannot control weather or wild animals so there's just no point. What I am afraid of is: failing, injury, hating it, not making friends, quitting, running out of money, and not knowing what to do with myself after Springer Mountain.2. What about those serial killers? I read a book about that once...Look, is there anywhere in America where someone HASN'T been murdered? I've lived this long without being murdered, so I feel pretty good about my chances. 3. So, are you taking a gun?No. 4. But, how are you going to hunt for food?With my bare hands and a two inch long Swiss Army knife.Seriously though, the AT hits a grocery store every couple of days and, even in Vermont, you can barter for food with cold hard cash and/or Bernie bucks (cartoons of Bernie Sanders worth $10 American in Vermont and $0.0001 outside Vermont).5. Will you bathe? Aren't you going to smell bad?Yes, occasionally. and Yes.But I'm a hippy liberal AND a triathlete. I already smell bad most of the time. If you're coming to visit me, I will pay you in Bernie bucks to bring me a clean t-shirt. 6. But, what about *whispers* that time of the month?http://divacup.com/If you are a lady and don't already own one of these, we need to discuss this before we go any further. 7. So will you sleep in a tent?Hammock actually. And I bet I know what your next question will be: what if it rains? It has a rainfly. What if there are no trees, you say? It's the eastern US, there are trees everywhere. Also, I could just sleep on the ground, that wouldn't kill me for a night.8. Are you really hiking alone?Let me answer that question with a question: Would you be interested in quitting your job to hike in the woods with me for 6 months? No? Then, yes, I am really hiking alone...You were my last shot. *Sigh*9. What did your mom say?She was not surprised in the slightest. In fact, I think she was mostly surprised I hadn't done it already. That lady, god love her, has indulged more of my hare-brained schemes than everyone else in my life combined. Yes, she is scared for me, no, she has never once tried to talk me out of it.10. Will you have a blog?No. Except for this one. I will have this one. So, yes.",,Still in my office.,"Mar 04, Fri",0
Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522658,"Almost every shakedown hike I've taken this winter has ended in me packing out at least 5 lbs of garbage. When the vegetation dies off for the winter and the seasonal trail maintenance crews all go into state mandated hibernation, our local state parks begin to fill with garbage at an alarming rate. Some of the trash is so inexplicable to me that I can't help but marvel at the absurdity of modern humanity. For example, here is a short list of some of the odder objects discovered on yesterday's 11 mile hike on the local backpacking loop:1. A frappuccino bottle, found 3 miles from the closest trailhead. Who would carry in Starbucks on a *minimum* 6 mile round trip hike? For some reason, this one truly bothered me.2. 3 soccer balls, left at almost exactly 1 mile increments, labeled with motivational phrases like ""you're almost there!"" My golden retriever joyfully helped carry these out. My theory is that they were placed by an over-eager Boy Scout parent who helped plan the weekend backpacking trip and didn't feel like retracing their steps...3. A microwave. Just how and why does a microwave end up this far from a road? I couldn't exactly carry that guy out. Here's hoping that a powerlifter with an up to date tetanus booster happens to wander by sometime soon. It breaks my heart to see this level of blatant disrespect for nature and shared spaces. And it seems like an impossible task to try to keep up with the damage we inflict on trail environments.There has been a lot of talk in the AT community about overuse and the resulting damage to the trail, particularly in Georgia and Tennessee, where most Katahdin hopefuls start. That's one of the primary reasons that I decided to do a Flip Flop instead of a NOBO hike this year.But, I've also been struggling with the inherent selfishness of my decision to hike for 6 months, especially during a presidential election season (speaking as a reformed campaign operative here), so I've been seeking a way to make my thru-hike have a larger impact than just helping me ""find myself."" Inspired by these guys: http://packingitout.blogspot.com/ who removed over 1000 lbs of trash from the AT last year, my goal is to remove as much trash as I can logistically manage during my hike. Since I don't have a strict timeline (like a job or school to get back to; or worrying about reaching the end before Katahdin closes for the winter) I can take my time and pick up trash as I go.Now I just have to figure out the logistics of finding people to help me get the trash off the trail (more often than my typical every-four-days scheduled town stops) and work on getting my pack a bit lighter so the extra 10 pounds of garbage won't be unmanageable. But, I'm excited to add this element to my hike! Advice and opinions gladly accepted!",,East Fork State Park,"Mar 05, Sat",0
Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522976,"First, I'm so thrilled by the positive response I received after my last post! Thank you to everybody I heard from here and on Facebook about my plans to turn my hike into a trash scavenger hunt. I'm so excited to have found a larger purpose for my hike beyond my own dreams (which are an equally good reason to hike). I want to explore a little more into why I decided to assign an external motivator/burden to this already challenging trek, if you'll just bear with me.Recently, I have been struggling with the very real possibility that I'll hit the trail, walk in the rain for a bit, feel miserable, and quit. Statistically, approximately 70% of people who start a thru-hike of the AT don't make it all 2,189 miles.That's a scary number.What would stop me from quitting, right? My feet hurt? I'll just go home. Got norovirus? I'm watching Friends on my parents' couch for the next three months. I wouldn't be the first to make that decision, nor would I be the last.I don't like to think I'd give up that easily, but I am also not 100% confident that I can keep myself internally motivated for months on end. (This is where I usually start overthinking things. Textbook Rigby behavior) Last fall, I raced a Half Ironman and PR'ed at the half marathon distance, but I struggled a lot to actually make it to my two-a-day workouts and train consistently for the six months leading up to those races. I didn't swim for a month straight because I just couldn't bear the thought of navigating around the aqua aerobics ladies who insisted on sharing my lane each morning. I stopped doing my supplemental strength workouts because they weren't *technically* on my training plan (they were in the appendix...). I skipped a long run because I couldn't find my favorite socks. Really. When I finally crossed the finish line at Challenge Cedar Point in September, I was happy, yes, but mostly I was just DONE. I never wanted to get on my bike or lace up my running shoes again. The feeling didn't last, of course, but it was pretty overwhelming at the time and my internal motivation was just barely hanging on. I know there are going to be challenging days on the trail, but I don't want my hike to become a slog or a race against the clock. I'm naturally so competitive (I raced a complete stranger up 7 flights of stairs at work yesterday. What is my life?) that I worry I'll end up chasing miles, overly concerned with the destination, instead of savoring the journey. I don't want to push myself to the point of never wanting to hike again, because hiking and running are my therapy, they're how I keep my head on straight.In a lot of ways, that makes my decision to clean up the trail a selfish one because1. It gives me permission to hike SLOWER, since I'll be focused on my immediate surroundings and stopping to pick up trash as I go. I'll also be carrying more weight- a few pounds of beer bottles will naturally slow me down a bit, even if I'm not the one consuming the contents of said bottles.Originally, I wanted to hike the whole trail in 4 1/2 months, but I've stretched that out to 6ish, which means my average daily mileage just got A LOT easier.2. It provides external motivation and pressure for me to keep on keeping on. I'll be journaling my experiences here and developing a social media presence for the project, which serves as a sort of accountability measure. If my hike is not 100% internally focused, any decision I make to leave the trail will affect more than just myself, which means I'll [ideally] carefully consider what I'm doing.3. I'll feel less guilty about quitting my job and making my parent's pet sit my evil cats for me because I'll get to be both hiker trash and a semi-contributing member of society at the same time. Score. All that being said, the original reason- and still my primary motivation- I want to do this clean up is because I've seen way too many local trails trashed by people who either don't know or don't care about Leave No Trace ethics. The Appalachian Trail is a national treasure that I want to help preserve for future thru-hikers. And I want to spread the idea of LNT to as many people as I can so our wilderness areas can be protected. If I can somehow motivate a few people to reduce their environmental impact while I'm out there this year, I'll call this adventure a success.As always, I'm eager to hear your thoughts, opinions, and/or criticisms- jog on over to the Guest Book and drop me a note.Thanks, y'all.",,More thoughts on garbage.,"Mar 09, Wed",0
Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523181,"Time for my requisite ""The Things They Carried"" post...Everyone loves gear, right? When all you have is what you can carry in your pack, every single item is considered, weighed, modified, and re-considered repeatedly in the months leading up to the thru-hike. Or is this just me? I have over thought this portion of my trip planning to the point that I have my gear list and the itemized weights memorized. I went into this hike knowing that a lot of my gear will be replaced or abandoned along the way, so the name of the game was ""Low Cost, Low Weight."" Here's what I'm looking at bringing with me, please critique and question to your heart's content, I could use the feedback:Sleep and Shelter:-Mountain Hardwear Phantom 32 Sleeping Bag-Mountain Hardwear Waterproof Compression Sack-Gossamer Gear Hammock Pad-Hennessy Expedition Asym Classic Hammock w/ Rainfly-""Snake Skins"" Hammock stuff sack-Hennessy webbing hammock strapsPack:-this is actually in flux right now, I'll update it later.

I'm also pretty jazzed about the Gossamer Gear pad, because I can use it in shelters- I didn't want to go with an underquilt, because I'd be really uncomfortable if I chose to sleep in a shelter, but I've also found that most pads don't work well in hammocks. The Gossamer Gear pad is wide enough to wrap around my shoulders, eliminating any worry about cold spots, but packs down pretty small and only weighs 10 oz! Anyway, I think that's all for today. Let me know in the guest book if you have any feedback on my gear list! I'll also be posting some updates over on Instagram (@AT_Rigby) after the good people at Roads, Rivers, and Trails shake down my pack next week.",,Let's Talk Gear,"Mar 11, Fri",0
Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523561,"I hung a countdown calendar in my office today. 29 days of work left until I'm finally gainfully unemployed! Really hoping we can get someone started into my position soon, so that I can get them trained and leave my job without too much guilt.In other news, I haven't raced since my half marathon PR last fall, but I ran the Heart Mini 15K this weekend. I've been really worried that I'm actually losing fitness, since I just hike a lot, instead of my typical 12 hour a week Ironman training schedule, but the 9ish mile run on hilly terrain was easy, breezy wonderful (admittedly, I was running 3:1 with a friend at several minutes/mile slower than my half marathon pace, but, just let me have this one). Even more exciting than my easy run, my awesome friend Mallory, who is in training for her first marathon, set a PR at the half marathon distance. I'm a little- well, a lot- jealous of her right now. I'm so competitive and I love working towards intense goals, but I knew I had to focus on healing all my war wounds from last season if I wanted to minimize my chances of injury out on the trail this year. Already looking forward to training for an ultramarathon if I can make it back from the trail alive...Speaking of ultramarathons, I finally got a chance to chat with Seth from Packing It Out yesterday (his bio says he runs ultramarathons, so that's a semi-logical segue). I don't know him well, but I'm about 97% sure he's a great guy. As I mentioned before, Seth, Joe, and Paul (aka Cap, Goose, and Spice) packed over a thousand pounds of trash, including a couple of mattresses, off the AT last year. Their work helped inspire me to do something similar this year, so we talked strategy for a bit. They're going to be on the PCT packing out trash this season, which sounds like a logistical nightmare, but I'm sure they'll kick all manner of ass. So now I'm even more excited about this complicated plan of mine, because Seth was super excited and it was really invigorating to talk to somebody else who was equally jazzed about garbage. Picking up trash is a task typically reserved for low level offenders and teenagers who need something on their college applications, but I am so excited.

I'm pretty excited about it.The frame and hip belt are adjustable, so I'll have to recruit the local outfitters to help me get it sized correctly. My favorite feature- it's basically a giant dry bag! The whole thing is waterproofed, which, frankly, is a feature I think every backpack should come with... Plus, PLUS, it's a pound lighter than my current, 40 liter pack. I'll have to do a few shakedown hikes with it, make sure I'm comfortable, but I've got high hopes That's it for now!",,Gear Update,"Mar 22, Tue",0
Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527108,"Today, I finished making enough backpacking meals for 3 mail drops, aka all the drops I'll need on the first half of the trail. Mama Bee helped out- we made pesto pasta, couscous with Parmesan and sun dried tomatoes, curried rice, cheddar mashed potatoes, and a boatload of instant oatmeal packets. I'm feeling good about my food choices.That being said, the process made this whole trip feel very real and now I'm 7 different kinds of nervous. 6 months is a long time to be in the woods. 2189 miles is a lot of miles. My hip kind of hurts, what if it gets worse. Now that I have 20 lbs in my new pack, I'm not sure I like it. Et cetera, et cetera, ad nauseum. I've been following a few hikers here, on Instagram, and on Appalachian Trials who have already started and the [predictably high] attrition rate has me doubting myself a bit. Statistics are one thing, but actually reading about WHY people quit is unnerving. Especially because none of the stories I've read yet have been particularly compelling, it's always just ""I wasn't feeling it"" or ""I got norovirus."" That's why people quit?! Shit, if that's all it takes, I'm just statistical cannon fodder. I'm a baby every time I get a cold. Oh boy.I'm sure I'm just overthinking this whole thing, but right now, I'm reminding myself of a pre-wedding Chandler Bing, terrified of commitment to an uncertain future, so I'm hiding out in my parent's guest room with beer and Netflix. To help mitigate my concern, I made a deal with the parents today- if I decide to quit, they are only allowed to come get me if I'm seriously ill or injured. Otherwise, I have to figure out how to get back home on my own, via bus or train or whatever. If I can't get home easily, maybe I'll be less likely to become part of the 70% that don't make it. Because they're lovely and supportive parents, Ma and Pa have always been an easy out for me when things get tough- college roommate killed my beta fish? ""Mom, come get me away from this crazy bitch."" ""I'm on my way now."" Easy peasy. But this time, I'm taking that option off the table because 1. I'm a grown ass human being who shouldn't be calling her mom to bail her out and 2. I don't want to quit the trail unless it's medically necessary. I know myself well enough to know the ""medically necessary"" threshold is, don't worry. Well, maybe worry a little bit. I did race a half-Ironman with a stress fracture in my foot, so I'm kind of a moron. Oh shiz, another thing to worry about.I think the moral of this utterly pointless post is that Mom and I make really great backpacking food and she should start a side business shipping Mom-Made meals to hiker trash. Also, I am terrified I'm going to think the AT is too hard and want to bail. Mostly the second one.PS.

Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530414,"It's 3 am on the first day of my hike. I've been awake for hours, no surprise there.I drove to Harper's Ferry yesterday, leaving behind a few grumpy house cats, one baleful golden retriever, and hastily written instructions for a few mail drops.The weather is a charming, character building kind of unpleasant- rain, fog, 40 degrees overnight. 25 degrees cooler than Cincinnati.I'm staying with my parents, who insisted on joining me for my first day on the trail, at The Jackson Rose, a historic B&B where Stonewall Jackson was headquartered during the- as they seem to call it around here- ""War of Northern Aggression."" Dad is thoroughly enjoying the history of the place. I'm fond of the sorely needed glass of wine the proprietors greeted me with upon arrival.I met my first fellow hiker yesterday, while searching out my first white blaze. His eyes were down, trudging through town with a beleaguered looking pup in tow. Mom greeted him, because that's what she does and not what I do, because anxiety. He sounded exhausted and frustrated, searching for a place to stay in exchange for work. He said his funds were tapped and he just wanted to go home. We wished him luck and he plopped himself to the ground in front of the Amtrak station. Momma Bee, eager for a chance to deal out trail magic, gave him the cash he needed for a room in the hostel, asking him to pay it forward when he could.

Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531222,"The wonderful hosts at The Jackson Rose B&B deserve a round of applause for their amazing send off breakfast Friday morning- zucchini muffins, fresh fruit, made to order omlets, ham, and homemade biscuits with homemade jam. Plus some lovely strong coffee that I'm missing right now, as I write from my hammock in a rainstorm. I explored downtown and some of the museums with my parents, we picked up some sandwiches to take with us, and started walking. As parents are wont to do, mine insisted on many pictures. The first three miles follow the C&O Canal Towpath and the Potomac River, so it was lovely and flat. After that began the steep climb up to Weverton Cliffs, which were beautiful! I wouldn't say Dad enjoyed this climb, but I didn't have to do CPR, so I'll call it a win. We ate lunch, attempted to ignore the couple photographing themselves making out, and enjoyed the view. The cliffs overlook a bend in the Potomac and you can see all the way up river to where the Shenandoah River joins. It's really stunning.Then it was time for ma and pa to head back to Harper's Ferry. I cried a little bit, which I blame on Mom, because she started crying first, because she wanted to read an old Irish Blessing for me, I'm sure you know it: ""May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your face;the rains fall soft upon your fields and until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand.""Onwards to my first shelter! Ed Garvey Shelter is beautiful- the Potomac AT Club does a great job! I decided to sleep in the loft, aka the Penthouse, which I got to myself. A fellow thru-hiker, Walkman (Walk Man? I'm not sure), who has apparently been up and down the length of the AT a few times, had the shelter to ourselves for a while. Another flip flopper got in her tent at 5:30 and never came out, so I didn't get to meet her. A few hours later, three young Towson grads joined us. They tented nearby, but built up a nice fire for us. After dark, two section hikers from the Jersey shore, Hardcore and Road Runner rolled up. We made a good group, had a nice night chatting. One of Hardcore's nephews played competitive college Ultimate Frisbee (that's a thing?) with our Towson group, which is just bizarre to me on so many levels...It was chilly overnight with a nice little mist rolling in. Said mist didn't clear out until 4:00 the next afternoon, so, needless to say we weren't moving terribly fast when we woke up. I finally rolled out around 8:30. Apparently thruhiking is like running for me- the first mile of any day kinda sucks but then I'm in the groove. It was creepy, walking through dense fog. I was up on a ridgeline with probably fantastic views of rural Maryland, but I couldn't see a thing, just cliffs and nothingness. I had my trash picker out and collected about a pound and a half before reaching Gathland State Park, about 3 miles from the shelter. I passed some friendly day hikers, a few thanked me for picking up trash. Gathland had bathrooms AND an outdoor outlet, so I stopped for about 20 minutes to eat with a NOBO thru-hiker from Michigan named Candlemaker. The next few miles were foggy and vaguely lonely, so I listened to music off and on. Occasionally, I'd pause with the cold wind blowing in my face and just laugh I was so thrilled to be on the trail. I may have freaked out a few day hikers in this manner. Around 3 pm, mile 8ish, I stopped at a shelter to eat and rest, the Jersey boys were there eating, too so I was met with an enthusiastic ""Cincinnati!!!!"" when I arrived. I was only planning to go another two miles that night, they were headed for a shelter 6 miles out, so we agreed to meet at the Tavern a bit past my stopping point for a parting drink.I dreamed of red wine for the next mile, until the trail opened up into an historic park, a Civil War battlefield. I took a minute to read the historical markers and ponder the madness of war, like you do when you're alone with your thoughts. At this battlefield, the Union lost its first commanding officer, who was shot, carried to the house of a nearby friend, where he greeted the homeowner ""hello Sam, I'm dead!"" and promptly died. The song ""Iscariot"" by Walk the Moon was playing as I walked across the battlefield. It was a sobering moment. This country has a lot of scars...After a few sober (pun intended) miles, I found the campground, already nearly full with a school group. I quickly strung up my hammock to claim a prime spot, then dashed down the trail to my waiting wine glass.Again, I was greeted with a rousing chorus of ""Cincinnati!!"" when I found the Jersey boys at the bar, drinking Irish coffee and eating shrimp cocktail and calamari. Road Runner insisted that I try the calamari bruschetta, and it was magical, as was the overfilled glass of Malbec. We sat and talked for about an hour, then the guys had to dash- it was 4:30 and they had some mo miles to go.I trudged back to the campground, dutifully made my backpackers meal of cornbread stuffing and beef jerky, then showered in the delightful hot water in the bathhouse.Just as I was putting my food up on the bear pole (tall pole, hooks, for to keep your food away from bears), Walkman rolled in to camp and hung his hammock next to me. The rain started shortly thereafter, so here I lie, cozy and warm in my hammock. 14 miles to come tomorrow.","In Harper's Ferry

Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531234,"It rained all night. It kept raining as I packed up camp. I dragged my gear into the bathhouse to dry off and pack up, then dragged my heels getting started. I seriously considered stopping for brunch at the tavern, but they weren't open yet, so off I went. There was a picnic shelter in Washington Monument state park, about 2 miles up, where I planned to cook breakfast and have coffee.This was a bad plan, because I first had to walk 2 miles in the rain without coffee in my system. My feet were a little sore, I was stiff from 3 bad nights of sleep, and I started the day with a climb... Needless to say, I was feeling sorry for myself. After a dreary hour, I saw the sign for the park. I had plans to call my mom to whine, drink many cups of hot cocoa, and generally wallow in self pity for a bit. Then I heard it, over the sound of rain on nylon, the distinctive sound of a jersey accent shouting ""Cincinnati!!!"" And damn if it wasn't Hardcore and Road Runner, who had called it quits early the night before and stealth camped in the picnic shelter, with a roaring fire in the fireplace. Apparently a park ranger had come by at nine the night before to tell them that they're weren't allowed to camp there and that *wink wink* the next ranger would be by at 7:30 the next morning. The Jersey boys offered to wait for me while I ate so we could hike together, since we were all headed to Ensign Cowall shelter, 12 more miles down the trail. I hesitated to accept, since I had big plans to sit alone and feel sorry for myself, but they wouldn't take no for an answer, so I had two enthusiastic hiking buddies for the day. While I was eating, the rain stopped, so we hiked together in the mist all morning. Road Runner tweaked his knee and was in a decent amount of pain, but he powered through like a champ and the three of us spent the day swapping stories and laughing. Hardcore is a bombastic, cheerful guy who knows everybody and has a story for every occasion. Road Runner has a mind like a steel trap when it comes to movie quotes and a truly awful singing voice. We had fun. We ate lunch with the PATC (Potomac AT Club) Ridgerunner at his picnic table at Annapolis Rocks, even though the view was totally socked in with fog. The guys mentioned to the Ridgerunner that I was picking up trash and he got a bit offended by the idea that I could find trash on his section of trail. I have to give him kudos, his section was damn near spotless. Most of the trail has been, actually, except where day hikers roam. Hardcore did find a half full Dunkin Donuts iced coffee sitting on a stump that afternoon, though.We encountered our first Boulder field that afternoon, which was brutal, then rolled into the shelter to a welcoming crowd around 6:30.We played Asshole as a group, me, the Jersey Boys, Stuck, a fast moving NOBO who started in GA in March, the Two Sisters who were section hiking with their wonderful dogs, and Eric with no trail name from PA. Road Runner was president nearly every round and I was the Asshole because I'm terrible at card games. We had a lot of fun, though I had to admit that I can't shuffle cards, which was a vaguely humiliating moment. We were all in bed by nine and slept pretty well, despite the rain and Stuck violently kicking Hardcore in the head in his sleep, which woke the whole shelter.The next morning Hardcore pulled everyone's food bags down from the bear pole because he's a gentleman and also to wake everyone, then we slowly trickled out into the mist. Stuck took off first and quickly put quite a few miles between us and him. Eric left next, but planned to meet us in Pen Mar to get a ride to Waynesboro. I left with the Jersey boys (as a side note, they don't know I call them this) and the two sisters took their time- they were headed south to Harper's Ferry.As The trail led us through foggy pastures, Road Runner sang theme songs to 90s cartoons. After an hour the sun miraculously came out for the first time. Hardcore had a nasty blister and it was only nine miles to Pen Mar so we took our time, relishing the warmth and the ability to see more than 200 feet.After a steep descent we found ourselves at a beautiful river crossing. I took my shoes off and sunbathed on a rock with my feet in the water. RR just jumped on in the water in his skivies. It was cold, so there was a great deal of hooting and hollering. A few miles later, next to another beautiful stream, Hardcore finally booked his 1000th mile on the AT. We stopped for pictures and a bit more hollering. As we crossed the creek, very full from the continuous rain, RR was offering me directions on the best way to cross the slippery rocks when Hardcore interrupted to say ""Dude, I don't think she needs our help."" That was a nice moment. So many people have been skeptical of my solo thru-hike, and there's a lot of, let's say, benevolent sexism, with people who only want the best questioning every move I make, so having the former marine, whose trail name is Hardcore, for god's sake, realize I could hang with the boys, was a nice change.These guys have been great hiking partners, offering up everything from Nutella to their apartments so I can take a zero day on the beach in Jersey and go to one of RR's girlfriend's yoga classes. I am super lucky to have met them.Anyway, we had another big climb up ahead, but it dumped us out at a rock outcropping with stunning views. It was the first time any of had seen a long view in Maryland, so we took our time and ate lunch there. RR has insane taste in food that culminated in a jam, jerky, and curry powder sandwich that he relished. He insisted that we all try it. He and Hardcore had some back and forth where Hardcore reminded him that he was one of only a few men he fully trusted, and to not throw that trust away over a disgusting sandwich. I politely declined to sample.The afternoon was more climbing, more views, and a staggering descent through a boulder field that had Hardcore cursing the sky for his blister.When we hit Pen Mar, Eric was waiting and we agreed to split a hotel room because there were big storms on the way. The Jersey Boys were ready for a beer and a burger so we pulled into the first place that had both- an Applebee's. It was surprisingly delicious, but then, I had been in the woods for 4 days. They insisted on picking up the tab because they're the best guys ever, and then even drove us to the Walmart to resupply. I was tired, so my resupply is mostly snickers bar, poptarts, and Biscoff cookie butter, which the Jersey boys sampled using their knives before they dropped us off at the hotel.The hotel has comfy beds, laundry, a hot tub, and high pressure shower heads. I took advantage of all of these things, happily. I was craving root beer, for some reason, and downed 2 bottles as we watched South Park. A thunderstorm rolled in around 9:30 but we were already asleep, and snoozed right through it.","Dahlgren Backpacking Campground

Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531389,"Even in hotels, hikers wake up with sunrise... Even when it's raining so hard you can barely see evidence of the sun. I don't do anything without coffee in my system, so I head straight for the continental breakfast. It was standard continental breakfast fare- muffins, toast, inexplicably Wolfgang Puck branded coffee, and a make your own waffle set up. I was still south of the Mason Dixon, so there was also something gelatinous that resembled biscuits and gravy. I ate all of it. I'm not even sorry.Eric was eager to get going early and decided to walk the 2 miles back to the trail head. I was not and therefore did not. I paid for that room until 11, I'm staying till 11. I reorganized my stuff, dried my hammock in the bathtub, and watched several episodes of Supernatural, because of course it was on.A nice guy named Roger runs a shuttle out of Waynesboro and gave me a ride to Pen Mar. The weather was foggy and gray, but the rain held off. I sang 40 verses of 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall. I listened to a podcast. I jumped in puddles. I didn't see a soul all day.I stopped at Antietam Shelter, along a beautiful creek, to eat cookie butter (best food ever) and soak my feet. From there it was a short jaunt to Old Forge park, then to Tumbling Run Shelters which are BEAUTIFUL! The caretakers are awesome, they come up to visit nightly. There are two shelters, labeled snoring and non-snoring. I shared the latter with a NOBO thru-hiker named Postal, while Traveling Tom, Precious One, and Quiet Guy staked a claim to the snoring section. I got there quite early, knowing that rain would be coming in. Tom and I chatted about the Rainbow Family Gathering, which he has attended for 30 years, world peace, and birds. I also braided his hair for him. Needless to say, Traveling Tom is an interesting character. Just as the rain rolled in, so did Seam, another NOBO hiker, the first I've met in several days who was my approximate age. He decided to hammock, despite the rain.We also received a nice dose of Trail Magic from a group of Outward Bound instructors camping nearby, who accidentally made too much food. Gratefully, we scarfed down their leftovers.By hiker midnight, we were all ready for bed, so up went the bear bags and into the sleeping bags we went. In the middle of the night, I woke suddenly to the sound of rustling and snuffling nearby. The bear pole was only ten feet from me, helpless in a 3 sided shelter. ""Crap crap crap crap."" I did a quick mental inventory of my pack- is there anything scented in there? Anything to draw the bear closer? I turned toward Postal, to see if the bear had woken him up, too, just as the snuffling of the bear changed... Into a long drawn out snore... Coming from Postal.I almost threw a shoe at him for snoring in the non-snoring shelter, but instead I turned over and tried to slow my racing heart. Eventually, I fell back asleep.The trouble with hikers who wake up early is that everything we own is made of nylon. Which makes it noisy when you're trying to be quiet and thunderous when you're not trying to be quiet. Such was the case with the next morning's wake up call. As if the bear incident wasn't enough, I was also roused at 5:30. All this made for a grumpy Rigby, so I ate poptarts and scowled at the rain from the safety of my sleeping bag while the others began packing up. The trail started with a 1000 foot climb up to Chimney Rocks, which the Outward Bound instructors claimed was beautiful. It was raining, so I'll have to take their word for it. After that, the trail snaked along a windy ridgeline for a while. I ate snickers, picked up 2 lbs of trash, and eventually resorted to a podcast to keep myself entertained. That is, until I hit the boulder fields. It's hard to pay attention to Sara Koenig AND giant stabby, slippery slabs of granite at the same time. The wind really picked up, so I dashed the best I could to Caledonia State Park to eat lunch. I owe Road Runner an apology for mocking his disgusting sandwich the other day, because I made my own this afternoon. Buffalo peanuts + Mediterranean flavored tuna + tortilla = magic. Hiker Hunger is real, y'all.I hadn't seen a soul all day, so I got real weird and awkward when I ran into a group of NOBO hikers in the park. They all look so legit, with their gaiters and their grime. I just waved and walked on. They caught me a few miles later and I was right to be intimidated. They were a lot cooler than me...Now I'm resting at the magical, Disney-esque Quarry Rock Shelter, built in the 30s and religiously maintained by the Innkeeper, as he's known. There's a babbling brook, potted plants, and checkers! It's completely surrounded by dense rhododendron forest, filled with lively birds. They've been threatening rain for hours, but so far, nada. Which is really a nice change. But it's chilly tonight, and it's just me and a section hiker named Rhino, so it'll probably be an early night.","Pen Mar Park 
",Quarry Gap Shelter,"May 04, Wed",20.80
Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533302,"This will be a long series of posts, as I attempt to cover the highlights of the last week or so, so bear with me. I had a few posts ready to go, but I just reread them and they're mostly useless pontificating, so I'm rewriting it all...After leaving Rhino at Quarry Gap Shelter, I set off to do 13 miles. It was raining, on and off, and rocky, on and off. For a while I hiked through the most luxurious pine forest that smelled like heaven and Christmas and was like walking on pillows. It was mostly unremarkable, since the rain limited the views, but I've been writing what may be The Next Great American Novel in my head, so I was kept well enough entertained.About 10 miles into the day, it occurred to me that I could comfortably make it another three miles past my planned stopping point and stay at the Ironmasters Mansion Hostel in the State park. The allure of dry clothes, hot coffee that wasn't instant, and people (!) was too great to resist. I hadn't seen a soul all day and was getting a bit tired of myself. I had also hiked through the gloomy Dead Woman's Hollow for the past two hours and was feeling a strong case of the heeby jeebies setting in.With that in mind, I scurried down the trail at breakneck speed and ended up with the option to take a blue blaze (side trail) to a place called Sunset Rocks that was only 1/4 mile longer than the trail. ""Sure why not?""The climb to Sunset Rocks was challenging- hand over foot scrambling and climbing over massive granite boulders, the smallest the size of a Fiat. Panting, I reached the top of the climb, only to find a pre-teen boy, wearing blue jeans, sneakers, and a not at all sweaty t-shirt and pushing a similarly tidy bicycle. ""Hello,"" I said, shocked to see my first person of the day. He nodded and walked past me, ostensibly to ride or carry his bike down the rock scramble I'd just climbed up. Sunset Rocks is a narrow, quite spiky, rock ridgeline, which plummets straight down on either side. I scrambled and scrabbled my way across the ridge, wondering how in the world that kid got his bike up there. As I reached the descent trail, which slid down the backside of the hill at an implausible angle, I realized there was no possible way to get a bike to that rock formation. The obvious conclusion, after several days solo hiking? That kid was a mother-effing ghost! So, for obvious reasons, I ran the rest of the way to the hostel.Incidentally, the hostel was beautiful- in a renovated mansion that had belonged to the Ironmaster of the Pine Grove Iron furnace for which the state park is named. It was old and vaguely creepy, but the caretakers assured us that the ghost hunters hadn't found a thing last time they rented the place out. I should clarify who ""us"" is, here: I was joined at the hostel by two NOBO hikers, 38 and K-Train. They were very cool people, and, having hit the official midpoint of their through hike that day, had a lot of advice to offer.Because of the cold weather, None of us took part in the half-gallon challenge, for which Pine Grove Furnace is famous- eat a half gallon of ice cream to commemorate crossing the half-way point- but the caretakers did feed us a hearty meal and send us to bed with comfortably full bellies. And we got to watch their dog finish off a half gallon of sherbet...The next morning promised rain, too, so I reluctantly dragged myself out of bed early, so I could get the miles over with. We chowed down on waffles, bagels, and muffins, then headed out. I snapped some pictures of the iron furnace and the still-shuttered AT Museum, then started walking. My Great American Novel got some attention this morning: Ana is really starting to be an interesting character... I walked, it rained, I kept walking. I stopped at a shelter for lunch and hot tea and met another thru-hiker I had been leap frogging for days, KT. We chatted for a bit, she was considering just staying there for the rest of the day. I continued on. Around 4:30, I arrived at my goal shelter to find 38 and K-Train already holed up there. They had optimistically planned for a much higher mileage day, but the rain was just too miserable. The night was generally unexceptional, besides the jarring and noisy late arrival of a section hiker with a very bright headlamp.The next morning, I darted into Boiling Springs, PA, catching a dose of trail magic in the form of ice water at a road crossing in the way. Boiling Springs is a charming little town- I stopped at the ATC Mid-Atlantic office first, then on to the local coffee shop for French toast and a cappuccino. After, I chatted with the guys at the local outfitters, bought a new sport, and headed towards the only hotel in town.The Allenberry is the type of resort that I imagine had a Patrick Swayze-esque dance teacher back in its heyday. Now up f sale and tragically on its last legs, the cottages and myriad dining rooms and bars were mostly closed. There was a theater, tennis courts, and trout fishing, all vaguely derelict but still quaint. Plus, my room with a King sized bed came in at a whopping $40. I did normal town chores- laundry, food resupply at a gas station, wandering aimlessly. I then watched the last 45 minutes of Dinner for Schmucks before heading off to the Allenberry's bar for a dinner of my own. The Kentucky Derby was on the bar TV and, even more entertaining, there was a vaguely redneck wedding in the adjoining banquet hall. I watched with amusement as Busty Bobbi (note the ""i"" at the end of the name) flirted with the bartender and loudly announced that the man with her, appropriately named Skip, was ""a FRIEND."" With no personal interest in appealing to the bartender, I shoveled a cheeseburger and fries into my face with abandon. It was at this moment that the tattooed, whiskey drinking Army vet to my right realized I must also be a thru-hiker. He introduced himself as ODB, a name I recognized from trail registers, and we passed the evening gossiping about Bobbi, trading trail stories and fielding questions from the locals. When I left the bar at Hiker Midnight (8 pm-ish) my bar mates loudly wished me good luck. I'm probably going to need it...","Quarry Gap Shelter

Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533303,"I'm proud to say that, even after my wild, late night at the Allenberry bar, I woke up feeling sprightly and ready to hike- I had 14 miles through hay fields and sunshine in the Cumberland Valley ahead of me. But first, breakfast.Back at the same bar, I ate heinous amounts of carbs and bacon and listened to the wedding guests recount tales of late last night. Apparently there had been a fight around midnight, which I was disappointed to have missed. Such is life, I guess. I went to check out and the lady at the front desk gifted me a can of root beer. I had asked her if she stocked any of that sweet nectar of the gods the day before and been disappointed, but she apparently found the can in the back of the fridge and set it aside for me. The trail provides.The walk through the Cumberland Valley was glorious- sunny, flat-ish, with picturesque pastoral views for miles in every direction. I hit my 100 mile mark atop a stile, headed into a pasture full of horses (if you follow my on Instagram or FB, you've seen evidence). Because it was Mothers' Day, I called my own from the pasture and chatted for a while.There were quite a few day hikers out that morning, mostly Mothers dragging their begrudging children as a special Mothers Day treat. That brought back some memories... I chatted with some of them, but while thru-hikers tend to be happy to see other humans and eager to chat, day hikers aren't always able to shake that don't-talk-to-strangers mentality we all live with in our day to day grocery store, riding the bus lives. My favorite was a lady out with her lovely golden retriever, who sat politely next to me, waiting to be paid attention, while her own and I discussed solo hiking as a woman, ticks, and other thru-hikers. While we were chatting, Roller, a British hiker who started in Harper's Ferry, caught up to us. She joined the conversation briefly, we established that we were headed to the same shelter that night, and she continued on.My feet had been causing me problems for a few days, so the afternoon passed slowly and painfully, but Roller was the only person at Darlington Shelter when I arrived. Soon after, Timeout and WannaChair (who is from Springfield, Ohio) rolled in. We all chatted for a bit as we cooked dinner, then I went to set up my hammock. The hammock is so much more comfortable than sleeping in the shelters, but it's a pain to carry wet gear, so I haven't used it much yet. When I got back, ODB had arrived, just before hiker midnight. The next morning, Roller and I established that we were again headed to the same place, a shelter just north of Duncannon, PA. WannaChair was shooting for the same place, but he needed to do laundry in town. We all needed a resupply and to visit The Doyle Hotel, a hiker institution, renowned for its filth and colorful characters. First, we had nine miles over rocks and a staggering descent on rock stairs. I hiked for a bit with WannaChair, discussing the best places to hike around Cincinnati, but I promptly lost him on a climb. He moves pretty fast up hills! A few miles after I lost him, I found a lifesaver that he left for me sitting on a log in the middle of the trail. It made my morning.Duncannon is a tragic kind of town, past its prime and unlikely to make much of itself now. Situated on the Susquehanna River, the largest unnavigable river in the US and a busy railway that carts coal to the east coast, it clearly was not designed for the 21st century. As I passed one of the only operating businesses left in town, a laundromat, I was startled to see a middle aged man wearing a poncho-and only a poncho- waving enthusiastically back at me. It took me a moment to realize it was just WannaChair. I recovered from the shock and agreed to meet him at the Doyle as soon as he had some pants to put on.I dropped my pack next to the others in the decrepit lobby of The Doyle and entered into the diviest dive bar to ever dive. The walls were stained with years of grease and grime, so that the shapes of recently moved signs were clearly visible. Plastic aliens littered the bar, which held all of about 15 bottles of booze. A dry erase board congratulated Anish on her record setting unsupported thruhike the previous year. Scott Jurek, who broke the supported speed record last year, did not get a sign. Scott Jurek probably never stopped at The Doyle.Vicki, the legendary bartender greeted me by confiscating my almost empty bottle of root beer. I asked her how she was doing.""Fat, old, and ugly."" She responded with a straight face. The bar erupted in laughter, other thru-hikers who had stopped in for a drink or burger the day before and been sucked into the Doyle Vortex. ""Let's see some ID, you don't pass the wrinkle test."" I pulled out my ID. She walked away and didn't come back for five minutes. ""Not a Scorpio, that's good. I don't trust Scorpios. My brother is one, I know how they are."" She handed me my ID. I ordered a burger and waited for 35 minutes. In that time, a SOBO hiker regaled us with stories of his wallet and food being stolen, hitching 45 miles to get to his mail drop in Duncannon, and road walking along an interstate. Roller and WannaChair arrived. WannaChair had been given $10 by a lady in the laundromat to pay for a shower at The Doyle. He asked Vicki if ever in Duncannon was that nice.""No, watch out for the crackheads.""She IDed Roller, then scowled. Turning to me, she shook her head, ""Remember that talk we had earlier?"" Then she pointed at Roller and mouthed ""She's a Scorpio, look out.""I like going places with Roller because no one in Pennsylvania can understand her accent, so they call her Rola. She and Vicki had this back and forth, too, ending in us spelling R-O-L-L-E-R. Around this time, WannaChair came back from the shower and said he wasn't sure where to put his towel when he was done, so he left it on the footboard of the bed. ""There's a bed in that room?"" The bartender responded. ""How weird.""We barely managed to extract ourselves from the Vortex and went instead to an overpriced convenience store to get enough food to make it to Port Clinton, then stopped at the soft serve ice cream shop. Roller ordered a small and was given damn near a pint of ice cream. ""I love America,"" she said in amazement.WannaChair, Roller, and I stuck together on the long climb up to the next shelter, arriving early enough for WannaChair to make a nice fire. There was a bizarre selection of discarded items in the shelter, neatly organized as if someone had a pack shakedown and abandoned half their gear there. I packed it all up, then enjoyed the fire and a novel gifted to me by the caretakers at the Ironmaster's Mansion.","Boiling Springs, PA

Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533304,"The next morning, I woke with my feet already sore. Roller and I agreed to set up camp 13 miles north, since there were no convenient shelter options. WannaChair wanted to go further and hopefully catch Timeout, so we said our goodbyes.The trail was rocky, it was cool and rainy, and my feet were killing me. I did not want to be hiking.We stopped at Peters Mountain Shelter for lunch and ended up staying there for hours. It was a gorgeous shelter, two stories, with an enclosed dining area and a deck. I told Roller that I might just stay the night there, given how sore my feet were, but the shame of only hiking 7 miles in a day would be too great, so I begrudgingly shouldered my pack and soldiered on.As it turns out, my shame was also self preservation. A few hours after we left the shelter, as he tells it, NOBO hiker Blues Brother was headed for Peters Mountain when he heard cursing and shouting. A man, headed south said, ""Sorry you had to hear that,"" as he ran by. Blues entered the clearing to find the shelter and surrounding forest ablaze, apparently 5-6 separate fires had been set around the shelter. Thankfully, he was able to put out most of the fires by beating them with a broom and called 911. In a comedy of errors, he was transferred to several different emergency departments, none of whom knew where he was, what the AT was, or who had jurisdiction. Eventually, the state troopers shouldered responsibility and told him they were on the way and to sit tight. The ground was littered with shotgun shells and Blues didn't know if the crazy man in the woods was planning to come back, so he sat awake in the loft, knife in one hand, trekking pole in the other for FIVE HOURS until the Rangers arrived at 1 am.This whole story was recounted to Roller and I 17 miles later, when we stopped the next night and encountered Blues napping there, trying to make up some sleep before he continued on.We had passed a pretty unremarkable night, camped on a ridgeline north of Peters Mountain, then slowly hiked the 13 miles to Rausch Gap Shelter. Blues was a fast hiker who routinely hiked thirty mile days, which is how he ended up at the shelter before us.While Blues Brother's story took the cake that night, he wasn't the only one to discover a case of arson in this section of PA. About 4 miles before reaching Rausch Gap, at a campsite easily accessible from several roads, I noticed a acrid smelling, smoky fire in a clearing 200 feet from the trail. Worried that the fire would spread, seeing no one in the area, and blissfully unaware of the attempted arson of the night before, I went to check the fire and put it out.What I discovered was a charred bear bag, completely filled with a weeks worth of food, including tuna packets, rice, and oatmeal, paracord for hanging from a tree still attached. Someone had covered it in leaves and sticks and attempted to set it alight, but only the plastic and paper packaging caught. The oatmeal and tuna steadfastly refusing to catch. I quickly stamped out the coals and took off down the trail, creeped out and eager to find other humans who weren't arsonists. I scribbled a note in the trail register at the campsite, warning the hikers behind me to keep their eyes and ears open, then scurried on, not stopping til I caught Blues and Roller at the shelter.","Clarks Ferry Shelter

Anyway: 
Shortly after Blues Brother told his arson story and fell asleep, a big bubble of NOBO hikers trickled in to Rausch Gap. The group had been hiking together since their second day in Georgia and their conversation was primarily made up of inside jokes and movie quotes, so it was impossible to follow. The whole gang was college aged, the youngest 18 and wearing his high school fraternity hat. After several days in the serene company of Roller and WannaChair, they were a bit jarring, but I came to enjoy their constant laughter and general mayhem making. They also ate like a plague of locusts, leaving no food bag unturned. For our own self preservation, Roller and I opted to tent/hammock and give up the relatively small shelter to the squad. The next morning, they left just before us , headed to the same shelter, the 501 Shelter, famed for two rare qualities: 1. It has 4 walls and a door, instead of 3.2. A local pizza restaurant deliversFirst, 17 miles on the rocks, 8 road crossings including an Interstate, and a thousand foot climb to a ridgeline with no views. I've mentioned previously that my feet had been giving me trouble. Today was a nightmare. I was limping and feeling sorry for myself and only moving forward because there literally was not another option. After 12ish miles of this, I came across some day hikers and stopped to chat with them. It came up in the course of conversation that I was having problems with my feet, probably the result of my insoles, and they generously offered me some aspirin. They also mentioned that there was trail magic about 3 miles away, offering cold drinks and snacks. Buoyed by the promise of food and the potential for a ride to a hotel where my feet could get a break, I thanked the day hikers and continued on. I had been moving slow enough that it was now late in the day and there was a strong possibility the trail angels would be gone by the time I reached the road crossing. Despite the excruciating pain, I practically ran down the trail, conquering 3 miles of mercifully rock-free and well maintained trail in 45 minutes. I passed Roller, alerted her to the promise of trail magic, and kept going, gritting my teeth to distract from the pain.""You need to walk faster, we almost left before you got here!"" The Trail Angel, an '04 thru hiker, scolded. I collapsed into a folding chair with a gasp, ""I tried!""His wife swatted him, telling me that ""one of the earlier hikers, the tall one, told us you were coming. Where's the other girl?""Roller caught up ten minutes later, after the Angels had dosed me with Tylenol and Coca Cola, claiming she had never seen me hike that fast. It was true, I am solely motivated by food and chairs. The Angels had bananas and granola bars and we were quite happy to sit with them for a while. Eventually, the day hikers I met earlier joined us. Caroline sat next to me and pulled off her boots, removing the insoles. ""Here, take these. We have the same kind of boots, maybe they'll help your feet.""I stared at her, a bit dumbfounded by her offer, unsure of whether to accept or not.The trail Angels reminded me that she wouldn't have offered if she didn't mean it, so I hesitantly and grateful accepted. I pulled the corrective insoles that had caused me such grief out of my sweaty boots and put in the new-to-me insoles from Caroline's boots. At that point, we only had two miles to the shelter. The many Angels insisted we take the leftover fruit and granola bars and sent us on our way. While I can't say the insoles magically erased all of my foot pain, the relief was noticeable. I was walking without a limp for the first time in days, and that's about as good as I could hope for. The shelter was about full when we arrived, but there were magically two bunks left. We ordered pizza and relaxed next to a fire built by two section hikers, getting acquainted with the night's cast of characters. In addition to the laughing NOBO bubble were two couples, also flip-flopping, a southbounder with the best behaved dog I ever met, and two section hikers from Jersey who fondly reminded me of The Jersey Boys. Dr. Trail, one of the NOBOs, had worked in Cincinnati briefly, so it was nice to reminisce about my hometown with someone who both knew where it was and didn't hate it (I am in Steelers territory, after all). A few minutes after we all settled in to our sleeping bags, a hiker I didn't know crashed into the bunkhouse with a staggering amount of groceries, pronouncing the great success of his trip to the discount grocery store that, apparently, took some five hours. Everyone politely ignored him and settled back to sleep.Reportedly, he decided to take a zero day in the shelter when he tried to pack his groceries, including several pounds of raw meat, the next morning.","Rausch Gap Shelter

The night's rain, in conjunction with the thunderous snoring of my bunk mates, made for a noisy night. The amplified rain also made everyone much more reluctant to get going the next morning. A few of the NOBO bubble took off early to knock out all 25 miles to Port Clinton. The rest of the bubble, hereby known on this blog as the Puppies, on account of their being young pups, made grand plans to not start hiking til after the rain stopped at 4 pm and to just night hike into Port Clinton.I was 15 miles away from the next shelter, so there I went, through infuriating drizzle that got heavier every time I took off my raincoat. We had received dire warnings that the rocks got bad after 501, and they were infuriating. PA is just littered with pokey bits of rock, mostly just big enough to be annoying and cause you to twist an ankle, but not big enough for you to really notice them unless you stare at the trail the whole time. So, that's what I did. A few times, I stopped to eat a leftover slice of pizza, standing in the middle of the trail with pack and rain gear on, since everything was dripping. I got to the shelter at 3, found Roller already there along with Survivor, an older hiker I'd been gradually catching up to for weeks. Survivor is just that, a survivor of lymphoma, and he's hiking to raise money and awareness for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. He had just taken a nasty fall face first into a boulder, so he was hiking with two black eyes and a massive knot in the middle of his forehead. Thankfully, he hadn't been seriously injured and he was back on the trail after a few days recuperating in a nearby hostel. The sun came out right after we stopped, so I spent a great afternoon soaking my feet in an icy creek and reading. A pair of guys from Jersey rolled in, we all cooked dinner and chatted. It was a feast, because everyone would be resupplying in Port Clinton the next morning and could therefore eat everything left in their food bags. I hammocked outside the shelter and, as we pretty much expected, the Puppies rolled in around midnight, too tired to make it all the way to town. As they explained the next morning, they ended up staying at 501 until 6 pm playing a contentious game of Risk... Probably not the best thought out plan, in retrospect.I was hiking about 50 yards behind Roller that morning when she stopped suddenly and turned back to me. She's super soft-spoken, so it wasn't until I was caught up that I discovered the cause of the delay. Roller always teases me for not noticing snakes, because she sees like five of them a day. I argue that, because she always hikes about ten minutes ahead of me, she is either making up these snakes or scaring them all away before I get to them. With that in mind, at first I didn't believe that the bush in front of us rattled at her.But then I saw it, a writhing, shiny black pile of snake, with two angry sets of eyes glaring at us. ""Oh, f*ck! Wait...They don't look like rattlesnakes.""""They rattled, though.""""Are you sure?""Roller just glared at me, then said to the snake ""Hello, we're your friends. I am going to take a picture of you, though."" The snake just tasted the air and stared some more.""Alright, well, they don't seem to care we're here. Maybe we'll be okay."" I said with bravado, as I banged my trekking poles against the ground, hoping to scare off the possibly-rattle snakes. They just glared back, unmoved.Halfway convinced, Roller took a hesitant step forward and the furious rattling began. She jumped back, the rattling stopped.""F*ck, okay, definitely rattling. I say we run.""""In which direction?""We stared at the snakes, they stared back. After a few minutes, clearly bored, the first rattler uncoiled herself slowly and slid out onto the trail. Easily six feet long, and very Voldemort-y, she eyed us once more, then slipped into the woods on the other side of the trail. Her snake pal watched her go for a minute, then followed. The two glided in tandem sufficiently far away.""Jesus, that was gross,"" I said, as we started hiking again.The descent into Port Clinton was absurd. Just a straight shot down to the river, 1000 feet in half a mile. None of those fancy switchbacks or well built stone steps, just a root and rock riddled slope of death. Northern PA trail maintainers seem to delight in making their trails borderline impassible.Luckily, even Roller's bad knee survived the descent and we found ourselves in town. Port Clinton is desperate and decrepit, much like Duncannon, but a local church maintains a pavilion and park for hikers to camp in and a trail angel lets us use the spigot outside their house, so it's as good a place as any to take a day off. We ran into KT outside one of Port Clinton's three operating businesses, the Peanut Shop. She was eating pop rocks and planning to catch a hitch into Hamburg to resupply. The next stop was the Port Clinton Hotel, which reminded me of a less-charming version of The Doyle. They are famed for their cheesesteaks, packed with 16 ounces of meat. Roller and I skipped those, but did eat a tolerable lunch. We then dropped our gear at the Pavilion where the Puppies were again playing Risk, and decided to hitch to Hamburg.I've never hitch hiked before, and I gotta say, it's not my preferred method of transportation. We got picked up fast enough, since it was raining and we were girls, and all. The young couple was happy to drop us at the Hamburg Super Walmart, packed to the gills on a Saturday afternoon. We were momentarily stunned by the dizzying array of options and Roller was baffled by the size of the carts, but we quickly filled one with mangoes, kale, fresh bread, and cheese. I counted 40 different poptart flavors, then got so overwhelmed that I bought granola instead . After an hour, we were happy to leave. The checkout lady was shocked to learn we were hikers, claiming that most hikers just buy candy and smell much worse than us. Laden with an impractical quantity of food, our next stop was the (world's largest) Cabellas. We both needed gaiters and canister fuel. But first, we had to trek across the concrete wasteland that is suburban America. It was a solid mile, though it only looked like a block or two on the map, through not-pedestrian friendly parking lots and busy roads. Roller said finally, as we passed a Five Guys and and Army Surplus store, ""now I really feel like I'm in America.""Oh, but wait, because that Cabellas was a genuine feast of every negative American stereotype imaginable. Make America Great Again hats and t-shirts with logos like ""Confederate Lives Matter"" (sidebar: eff that guy, seriously, what an arse). There were guns and Amish people and fat children eating beef jerky. The whole place was completely ludicrous. Unsurprisingly, their backpacking equipment was relegated to a back corner. We found canister fuel, but nothing else we really needed and decided to split. As we waited in line, we marveled at the guns and guns and eagle tshirts and speculated about what American patriotism would look like if the Turkey had become our national bird. Now carrying a silly amount of weight in flimsy plastic bags and facing a hideous thunderstorm rolling in over the mountains, we attempted to hitch again. I think all the plastic bags of loot made us either sketchier or less pitiable, because it took a lot longer to get a ride back. Eventually a middle aged lady in a BMW stopped and ferried us the two miles to the pavilion.The Puppies were at dinner when we got back, but the pavilion had quite a few newcomers, including the pair from Jersey we met the day before. They had spent the afternoon throwing back $2 Yuengling at the Port Clinton hotel and were already in their hammocks. Odysseus was reading, Survivor and another older hiker were in their sleeping bags. Roller and I gathered our laundry, cobbled together some real fancy outfits from the box of donations in the corner. My options were a sequined paisley muumuu or cropped maternity sweatpants printed to look like denim. I went with the latter. We went to the hotel, paid $7 each, and took the world's worst showers- excruciatingly hot, then ice cold, with zero control over which you might get. The panels of the shower walls were all collapsing inward and I was afraid to touch anything, but it was my first indoor shower (501 had an outdoor ""solar"" shower that was actually a hose with well water, not that I'm complaining) in a week, so I coped. Afterward, we did laundry in what I suspect was once a root cellar and charged our phones in the almost empty bar, drinking, I'm not kidding here, Franzia, their house wine.When we got back to the pavilion, everyone was fast asleep, so I shimmied into my bag and passed out.The next morning was dreary and cold, but Roller made scrambled eggs and we had fresh fruit, so we enjoyed a long breakfast. The Puppies went to Hamburg to play with guns at Cabellas, Most of the others hit the trail. KT turned up around noon, having stayed with a trail angel the night before (she has a knack for getting free room and board) and decided to take another zero.I spent the afternoon nursing a glass of something claiming to be wine and reading a Pennsylvania newspaper while my phone charged in the hotel, then joined KT and Roller for an evening of sitting quietly in the shelter, glaring at the rain from our sleeping bags. It was getting down to the 30s that night (as Roller says ""what does that mean in real degrees?"") which we were less than thrilled about. Late in the evening, we were joined by another hiker, Carbo, who I'm fond of because he shares coffee.We settled in for a chilly night and an early morning.","501 Shelter

Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535282,"The climb out of Port Clinton, like most climbs out of towns where I just spent time getting fat and happy, sucked. I climbed SLOW, pretending to take in views as I went. KT passed me, I passed her, and so on. At the top of the ridge, I stopped to clean up a campsite where someone had dumped days worth of trash in the fire ring. I heard a loud thump and some cursing- it was KT and somehow her hip belt had ripped off her pack. I offered up paracord and repair tape to help her get get pack back into semi working order, but it looked pretty uncomfortable. Fingers crossed for her, we continued on, passing each other on and off most of the day. The day before, I had received two very, very big pieces of news, and I spent the day mulling them over. First, one of my favorite people in the world, Brookie, got engaged to Nick. They're engagement story was hilarious and adorable, like most of their relationship, and I was-and still am- SO thrilled for them. But, my other piece of news was of the less celebratory variety. My dear friend and former colleague, Tom Jordan passed away. He was diagnosed with end stage lung cancer last year, only shortly after he moved to California to live the dream. Tom taught me a lot of things, not just about nursing, and I'm so sorry to lose him.All day long, I wavered between the exhilaration of the trail, excitement for Brooke, and overwhelming sadness for Tom and his family. Needless to say, it was a crazy day. The trail took us past a few incredible views; a rock outcropping called the Pulpit, another known as the pinnacle, where you could see for miles. They were ideal places to ponder the meaning of life and death, but they were also crowded with day hikers, college students enjoying their first day of summer break. The day ended at Eckville Shelter, a cabin behind a caretaker's home owned by one of the trail clubs. The shelter was full when I arrived, but there were great tenting sites. Roller was there already, KT apparently missed the turn and kept going. Seal Tree, one of the Young Puppies, was there, too, and we spent a while chatting. Eventually, the rest of the Pups rolled in, but I barely recognized them. They had all been to the barber in town and looked positively spiffy. Frost and I commiserated on our inability to grow beards. Everyone cooked dinner together, then began sharing snacks, since we were all fresh out of town with way too much food. I distributed Cadbury cream eggs, Doctor Trails shared taffy, then the caretakers began bringing out leftovers. Popsicles, then watermelon, tomatoes, carrots, and leftover veggie burgers. The entire crowd in the shelter had already called it a night, so just Roller, myself, and the Young Pups were reaping the benefits of this bounty. Finally, the caretakers emerged with a half empty bottle of cava, which we happily distributed amongst the 6 of us, drinking out of our collapsible silicone mugs or metal cups that always vaguely tasted and smelled like instant coffee. Let's just say it was a great night.The next day, like many of the days before it, involved lots of rocks, a bit of trash, and not much else. I stopped at a shelter with a good sized group to eat lunch. It was misty and cold and I stalled at the shelter for far too long, reading another found John Grisham novel. After a few chapters, I dragged myself out of the shelter and onward.The afternoon included an awkward encounter with a heavily armed man outside a shuttered B&B and a section of trail appropriately named Knife's Edge. It ended at a shelter where we met fellow flip floppers Lois & Clarke, Towtruck, and Ziptie. They call themselves The Slackers and take every blue blaze they come across. As a result, I don't think they've ever hiked more than 10 miles in a day, but they were friendly and a lot of fun. Roller and I took the shelter, which was easily 80 years old and rumored to also host a belligerent porcupine, though we never met him, while KT and The Slackers tented.The next day, we were headed to Palmerton to do a small resupply. Palmerton is a dreadful little town, much like the last few I've been through, though it also has the unique distinction of being an EPA Superfund site.The area around Palmerton has been so heavily polluted by zinc mining and refineries that the water is undrinkable and the hillsides deforested. The EPA has been attempting to regrow the forest on the ridgeline for 30 years, with next to no success. It's charming.We caught a hitch on a busy highway from a middle aged woman in a Prius who said she felt obligated to pick us up but was clearly miffed by said obligation. We didn't care. A ride is a ride. When she dropped us off, she warned us ominously, ""This is coal country. People aren't nice here.""Duly noted, thank you, ma'am.After a burger, a resupply at a gas station, and a conversation with a meth head, Roller and I again ran into KT. The three of us agreed to hike out on the blue blazed winter trail, which would save us a mile of bouldering up the infamous nightmare of the Superfund site.We trekked through a hazardous waste disposal area with a sign reading ""you're in America now, please speak English"" and began the long painful series of switchbacks up to the summit. The trail looked like high desert, just scraggly brush, rock, and sand. Our informal trio cursed and panted our way to the top, happy to hit the relatively manageable ridgeline trail. Through the stunted pines were spectacular views of rolling hills in the distance, with the zinc refinery chugging away in the foreground, of course.We stealth camped that night, at a site above a ski resort five miles past the Superfund site. The water was scarce and probably heavily polluted, and the AT punched us in the face with another rocky uphill scramble right at the end, but our site was nice and we'd have sunrise views in the morning.....I slept right on through the sunrise. Didn't even get out of the hammock until almost 8. Packed up slowly, but KT was slower, so I didn't feel bad about Roller leaving me in the dust. The trail that day included a handful of scenic views. I enjoy peeing in places with nice scenery (don't worry, I make sure I'm well hidden, I'm not a creepy exhibitionist). I startled a big old turkey (not a euphemism). I listened to a few podcasts. Honestly, my memory is a little hazy. Sometimes the trail is boring...","Port Clinton, PA

Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535283,"I've received multiple requests for an update on the lives and times of The Jersey Boys. Lucky for you (and also for me) I got to see 1/2 of the duo for the weekend. The events unfolded thusly:The morning I was due to reach Delaware Water Gap, I sent them both a text, letting them know I would be mere inches from the great state of New Jersey that afternoon. Bryan (aka Road Runner) called me immediately, a lucky chance because I keep my phone on airplane mode most of the day.""Ellen is coming to get you,"" he stated, ""she's leaving as soon as she gets off work at one.""Ellen is Bryan's girlfriend, a character I later told her I wasn't entirely sure was real based on just how much Bryan bragged about her. I wanted to ask if Ellen knew she would be driving to DWG that afternoon, since I'd literally just texted him moments before, but I was so thrilled he was willing to provide me a free vacation on the beach that I didn't bother.First, I had to hike 14 miles to the gap by 2:30. Off I went, spending a long time on the phone with my mom as I hiked.As I got closer to the Delaware River and Jersey, the views got more and more beautiful. I ate my snacks without stopping for breaks and made pretty good time. I ran into Roller at the next shelter for lunch and updated her on my plans, apologetically. The last few miles were gorgeous, along a straight, flat ridgeline road, then winding down the face of the mountain with beautiful river views.I ambled into town with time to spare. DWG is an oasis compared to the last few PA towns. I picked up a mail drop at the outfitters first, sent by momma Bee and well stocked with backpacking food, wine, and chocolate. Thanks mom!!My next stop was the local bakery, where you can get a hot dog and a slice of pie for $2.95. Roller found me there after she checked in at the hostel.In the meantime, Ellen sent me a picture of the collection of granola bars and trail mix she packed for our trip back to the Shore. I had high hopes for this mini road-trip.Ellen picked me up around four. She was a real person and actually as awesome as Bryan had described. She is a yoga instructor and grew up riding horses (with one of my Ranch Camp alums- Hi KP!), so we had a lot to talk about. Ellen graciously stopped at Target so I could buy real human clothes. At that point, I was 6 days removed from my last shower, 14 from the last time I slept in a bed. Seeing myself in the dressing room mirror was alarming, to say the least. Ellen and Bryan live a block from the beach in Asbury Park. Their place is awesome and I barely recognized Bryan in real people clothes. After a quick shower and change, I looked human-ish again and off we went in an Uber with their neighbor, Faona to a tapas bar. I'm definitely not in the mountains anymore...Faona is a character. She was on a diet so she only drank wine and had a lot to say on the subject. It made for interesting dinner conversation. The food was incredible and I ate myself silly. The highlight was pizza, very unlike the one delivered to 501 Shelter, just covered in truffle oil and ricotta. A glass of red wine and an Italian Old Fashioned sated my booze cravings, and the shared tiramisu and espresso were life changing after my instant coffee in the woods.Bryan works like a maniac, Ellen had to be at the gym at 7 am, and it was well past my bedtime, so we retired to their amazing gigantic couch and fell asleep by 11, watching Parks & Rec.The next morning, Bryan made me a smoothie and pancakes, gave me a brief driving tour of the town's historic landmarks, like legendary music venues The Stone Pony and The Paramount, then dropped me at Ellen's yoga class.Ellen hasn't been teaching long, but her class was great and I felt amazing afterwards. We did a lot of shoulder openers, necessary after carrying a heavy pack for 3 weeks. After the class, she insisted on helping me with my crow pose, which I've always been terrible at. I'm still terrible, but less so than I used to be, thanks to Ellen's persistence.They took me for a tour of the boardwalk, where we ate lunch and vaguely listened to live music. At one point, a spectacularly dressed old man, wearing coordinated lime green and black workout clothes, including knee high compression sleeves, approached the musician, was handed the mic, and began a lovely rendition of The Way You Look Tonight. Ellen and Bryan had a brief back and forth over dancing, Ellen said Bry had to ask her, he did, and they got up to dance. It was adorable and vaguely surreal to watch them dancing on the boardwalk.After lunch and shopping on the boardwalk, we watched more Parks & Rec, then The Interview, which I admit I thoroughly enjoyed. Next up was dinner at a different small plates restaurant, this time with their friends Joe, Lisa, and Blaise. Ellen insisted on dressing me, which was tricky because she's 5'2"" and a size 2 and I'm not either of those things. She recruited Bryan to convince me the outfit was okay and off we went in another Uber.At the restaurant, I discussed Feng Shui and airplants and Pink Blazing (http://appalachiantrials.com/art-pink-blazing/) with Blaise and ate food as it was handed to me by the others.Afterwards, we stopped by Joe and Lisa's house (seriously adorable, by way) and continued on to a bar on the boardwalk. At this point, it was already hours past my bedtime and I was exhausted from pretending to be a real girl all day. I struggled through one drink, but the crowd and the house music and the single moms dancing was totally overwhelming, so I apologetically ducked out and caught an Uber back to Bryan and Ellen's place where I promptly fell asleep. I spent the next morning journaling, incapable of sleeping late, then we rode bikes down the boardwalk to brunch. I happily gorged myself on grilled crumb cake and eggs benedict with crab and many, many cups of coffee. We rode back through the town of Ocean Grove, a gated community and spiritual retreat where they used to literally lock the gates for the whole season. You had to be there before they shut and stay until the end of the summer. Jersey is weird.After brunch, I reluctantly packed up my gear again and loaded it into Ellen's car. We got one last cappuccino and headed back to Delaware Water Gap. They dropped me at the church hostel, just as Lois & Clarke and the other Slackers walked up.I was sorry to see Ellen and Bryan go, they had been amazing hosts and my weekend at their place was an incredible break.I know it seems silly, to take a vacation from the trail which is essentially a vacation in and of itself, but it was sorely needed.The trail is exhausting, emotionally and physically. You spend a lot of time in pain, a lot of time alone, and a lot of time kind of bored. It's a roller coaster, both the terrain and your emotions. When everything is going wrong and your feet hurt and your pack is heavy and you're climbing up seemingly forever, you can feel the lowest of the lows. When you hit the peaks and throw off your pack and put on your camp shoes and eat cookie butter from the jar with a group of new, fascinating friends, you feel the highest of highs and it makes everything awesome again. It's exhilarating and it's exhausting. The breaks, where you can spend a few hours being a normal person in the middle of the road, make the highs more fun and the lows more manageable.All that to say, I owe Bryan and Ellen a huge debt of gratitude for giving me a break and ferrying me around. The trail provides.","Somewhere in Northern PA

Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535285,"After two nights of luxury on Bryan and Ellen's giant couch, I didn't sleep well on the carpeted bunk at the hostel. I had dinner with two fellow hikers at the local watering hole, then climbed into my bunk with the vague idea of reading. Instead, I promptly fell asleep. At some point in the night, I woke up to turn over and found myself face to face with Ziptie, my closest neighbor. Her nose was literally inches from my own, a startling experience, to say the least. I jumped back in surprise, cracking my head on the wall and knocking something off my perilously narrow bunk onto the ground. Every snorer in the room stopped snoring. I rolled back over to face the wall and stared at it for a while.As soon as I heard Nascar get out of his bunk in the morning, I was up and ready to go, too. First, though, I had to fall out of my too-tall top bunk and crash into the fan.I slurped down some gritty coffee left over from the night before and an enormous black and white cookie, and was out of the hostel by 6:45, a new record for me.The trail follows I-80 across the Delaware River, which is one heck of a way to wake you up. Interstate traffic, especially over aging bridges that bounce from the weight of the roaring semi trucks, is terrifying.The river was socked in with fog, but it burned off quickly as I started the long climb up a creek bed and out of the Delaware Water Gap. As a popular day-use area, there was ample trash for me to collect, but the great state of New Jersey provides trash bags at the trailheads, so I was able to fill up more than usual. Before second breakfast (10 am-ish) I had collected the usual Coors Light cans (it's always Coors Light), granola bar wrappers, and toilet paper (gag, WTF is wrong with people?), PLUS not one, but TWO pairs of men's boxer briefs. Get it together, Jersey...The creek was beautiful, but I was really looking forward to seeing Sunfish Pond, a gorgeous glacial lake, one of New Jersey's 7 Natural Wonders, according to a sign (good grief, Jersey). It really was beautiful- clear and blue, with a uniquely high acidity that meant only certain species could live in the lake. I planned to sit and revel for a while, but failed to find an empty seat most of the way around the pond. Every flat, sunny boulder had been claimed early by a snake; big, small, brightly colored, black and grey, the creepy little SOBs were all over the place. I finally found a snake free boulder and enjoyed a snack, then continued on, headed for the Mohican Outdoor Center for lunch. But first, Raccoon Ridge. Stupid name, stunning place. The rocky ridgeline was mostly exposed, with endless views east and west, mountains and lakes as far as the eye could see. At the very top of the mountain there was an incredible 360 degree view. With the sun shining and the warmest temperature yet (almost 80!!), it was absolutely incredible. I could have stayed all day, but MOC sells sodas and I was parched.I snaked along the ridge a while longer, crossed a stream where I startled a bullfrog, and began the rocky descent to the road. The trails are so much better than in PA, but they still have their rocky moments, so I stubbed my toes repeatedly on the way down. At the road crossing I found trail magic!! Someone had left jugs of water and cans of Sprite alongside a stream and I gratefully helped myself, cleaning up a few empties to throw away at MOC, just up the road.When I got to the visitor center, I prioritized; first ordering a sandwich with all the fixings and a Dr. Pepper, then acknowledging the presence of a fellow hiker, then reading National Geographic on their couch. MOC is a retreat or primitive resort, with cabins for rent and a dining hall, run by the Appalachian Mountain Club. It would be a great place to get your feet wet on the AT and meet some thruhikers without feeling too far from real humans. I flipped through the trail register before leaving and noticed that, despite my weekend on the Shore, I was only a day behind The Puppies. I was also excited to see Jabba's, aka The Real Hiking Viking's, signature on the first page from when he hiked through in February.I took a ""shortcut"" back to the trail that saved me from having to backtrack. After hiking through a place known as Rattlesnake Swamp, I emerged on the Kittatiny ridgeline, with mind-boggling views of the valley below. Unfortunately, I was feeling lazy after my 12 miles that morning and long lunch, and it took several hours of harsh negotiations to get my arse back in gear. There are always a few hours like this each day, where I just want to be not moving, and I never know what time of day it'll hit, so I just fly when I'm feeling good and never put in my headphones until the lull hits. KT and a few others passed me during this afternoon's lull, which always makes me feel worse. Eventually, the doldrums wore off, and I enjoyed the last three miles around a beaver bog and along a flat ridge. I stopped for dinner at a big rock outcropping overlooking Fairview Lake. The view was better than fair, it was unbelievable, the best view all day. I lingered a long time, eating couscous with sundried tomatoes and drinking wine out the the 1/2 liter juice box that Mama surprised me with in my resupply box. An eagle flew by, because of course it did.","Asbury Park, NJ

Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535286,"Days 2-3 in Jersey I was grateful to be back in my hammock last night, snug and so comfortable. I stealth camped alone on the ridgeline where I had stopped for dinner and actually really liked camping alone. It's nice to be able to change my clothes and do an oh-so-glamorous check for ticks without worrying about freaking out my hiking partners. I was in the hammock by 8:30, didn't wake up until 7 this morning.The wind was blowing, but none of the promised rain turned up, so I had no excuse to stay in my hammock as long as I did. I got up, ate some trail mix and chocolate covered espresso beans, since I was out of water, and packed up.The first few miles were rough going. Not because of the trail itself, I was just not in the mood to hike. I had to repeatedly remind myself that I wasn't on a deadline and didn't HAVE to hike 20 miles that day, if I wasn't up for it. Eventually, after getting more water, I stopped for second breakfast and coffee at Crater Lake, alone but for the company of the world's largest bullfrog. It's a beautiful spot, reminds me of northern Wisconsin, and I spent a long time there, giving myself a pep talk. It's amazing what memories crop up when you're out here alone. I spent ten minutes thinking about the classmate who threw away a picture I drew back in the seventh grade. She was a real bitch, but there's no reason to have remembered that particular moment...Anyway, after a long leisurely elevensies on the lakeshore, I persuaded myself to start walking again, bribing myself with a Fleet Foxes album. A few minutes down the trail I ran into what appeared to be a group of Boy Scouts, a bit odd for a Tuesday. Very unlike Boy Scouts, however, this thundering herd charged past me, chattering loudly and flinging Jolly Rancher wrappers about. Any Scout worth his salt can tell you that large groups are supposed to cede the right of way to solo hikers.Weird, but on I went. Until I met another group of boys. Then another. And another. Every ten minutes for hours, poorly equipped teenage boys, lugging over sized external frame packs and carrying their sleeping bags or tents in hand. Every group, apparently a part of a school trip, damn near shoved me into the underbrush as they went by. I was forced to stop to let them pass, making the 4.5 miles to the shelter take FOREVER. By the time I finally got to Brinck Shelter for lunch it was well past lunch. A fellow thru-hiker greeted me with ""I follow you on Instagram!"" I chatted with her and her partner, Misty and Snooze, for a bit, then they continued on towards the Tavern in Culver Gap.Before leaving, Misty cautioned me, ""There's a napping hiker in the shelter.""To which KT loudly responded ""It's only me!"" Of course it was KT. She has a knack for turning back up, just when I thought she had vanished, always with a crazy story. This story didn't disappoint.Apparently, she had gone just a few miles past me and stealth camped, only to be greeted overnight by a hungry bear, giving it the old college try to knock down her bear bag. She ended up sitting up by a fire, banging her trekking poles together to scare him off. According to my sources, New Jersey has a heckuva bear problem, which is why I hung my bag very, very far away from camp. I figured they could have my poptarts, if they were willing to work that hard, but just don't wake me up...There was also a note from Roller in the trail register, now a day ahead of me, ""Shelter was lovely, finding poop next to the spring was not."" I gotta catch up with her soon.Anyway, 3 miles further on was a road crossing and at said road crossing was a tavern, called Gyp's, which feels like it could be offensive in some contexts, that had a lovely back lawn and patio facing a lake. After only briefly getting lost and detouring through a boulder field, I met Misty, Snooze, and KT there. They had a separate hiker entrance- who can blame them- and every classic American bar food you can think of. I wen with buffalo chicken strips and fried with Old Bay seasoning. Misty and Snooze went with... everything else on the menu. It was incredible- fries, onion rings, pizza, burgers. I've seen some people pack away food out here, but these two had it down to a science. Kudos, guys.KT and I left to hike the last 3 miles to the next shelter, Misty and Snooze said they would catch up. I sincerely doubted it, that bar had a significant gravitational pull. On the way up the hill, we passed a mama bear and her cub. Thank god the shelter had a bear box.In the shelter, we met an awesome southbound flip-flopper, out raising money for a foundation he created in his mothers name after she passed away from pancreatic cancer. He had been on the trail for only a few weeks, so we spent a while talking gear and trail gossip. I was happy to hear he had called a douchebag the guy I had called a jackass a few days earlier. That guy thoroughly deserves both monikers.I set up my hammock, KT her tent, and our new friend took the shelter. Everything that even remotely smelled of anything went into the locked bear box and we all went off to bed.In the middle of the night, I awoke to a quiet rustling beside my hammock. ""It's a bear!"" I thought. ""No way it's a bear, way too quiet,"" my rational brain argued.I turned over and peaked under my rainfly.""AUGHHHH, BEAR!""Not five feet from my face, I big ole black bear was casually snuffling about like he owned the place.I thrashed around violently in my hammock, making an incredible amount of ruckus and setting my hammock swinging.Terrified, the bear darted to closest tree, reared up on his hind legs, and prepared to climb. He looked back at me to determine my threat level.""F*ck off, bear!"" I called, thrashing around some more.He stared for a second, then turned tail and galloped into the woods, missing KT's tent by a matter of inches.""F*ckf*ckf*ckityf*ck."" I whispered.I grabbed my headlamp and pulled up an alarm on my phone, should the 400 lb raccoon return, and sat awake watching and listening for him for ALMOST 5 minutes, at which point I promptly fell back asleep because, hello, hiking is hard.The next morning, KT was still fast asleep when I left camp, but her tent hadn't been ripped apart by an avenging bear, so I figured I'd see her soon enough. My neighbor in the shelter hadn't heard a thing and in fact felt quite guilty for sleeping through my bear fight.PS, I forgot to mention that I finally said something to one of the chaperones on the nightmare of a school-trip I had been passing all day. I politely reminded her that large groups typically cede the way to solo hikers. She must've immediately sent out a mass text, because the next four groups got off the trail to let me by. Score.","Fairview Lake

Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535287,"As always, I've neglected to update this journal on a regular basis, page back a bit if you want some more updates!After the visit from the bear the night before, I was feeling sleep deprived, yet determined to reach a place with 4 walls and a door before nightfall.The day started with a climb up to Sunrise Mountain, which was lovely. Coming down the other side, I encountered my fourth rattlesnake. He was a big sucker, who couldn't give a flying fart in space that I was nearby. He slithered along beside me, about a foot off the trail for a few yards, not even bothering to rattle. Because I'm not a moron, I gave him as wide a berth in possible and slipped past him. When I turned back to take a picture, he continued his trajectory without pause. His trajectory was coming right towards me. I settled for one blurry picture, then took off. The trail that day was nice enough. Sufficiently winding and climb-y to be considered interesting. But it was spectacularly hot, especially in the dense rhododendron forests. I listened to music some, sang along-aloud- with a Macklemore song in which the line ""Brad Pitt, that's my cousin,"" is repeated about 100 times.My first objective that day was to reach High Point State Park, home to-you guessed it- the highest point in New Jersey. I didn't really care about that, though. Their air-conditioned Ranger Station hands out free sodas to thruhikers. It was about 85 degrees by the time I reached the park and I about went into shock when I hit the climate controlled haven. KT caught up as I gulped soda and recharged my phone. We had 6 more miles until our stopping point, up over the high point and down into a beautiful, pastoral valley. We wove up over stiles, through fields of alfalfa and wild flowers, and through shallow creeks. I came around a bend and heard a large animal galloping through the underbrush. It was bear number four, who thankfully spotted me long before I saw him and was running fast in the opposite direction. His buddy, bear number five, was slightly less fearful and watched me with vague curiosity from a distance before following his buddy up the hillside. I arrived at the famous Secret Shelter, a privately owned cabin on former thruhiker and trail angel extraordinaire Jim Murray's property. It was dusk and the cabin sat prettily in a meadow, where a donkey grazed. KT and I were the only ones there, so I showered luxuriously in the piping hot outdoor shower that overlooked the valley, then ate dinner and second dinner on the porch. KT and I ended up talking until 11, the latest night I've had on the trail by far. It was a beautiful night, with the moon and stars lighting the valley, and I slept surprisingly well on the floor of the cabin.The morning dawned sunny and warm. I journaled and read for a bit on the front porch, then sipped on a cup of coffee for a bit. Then another, because it was a relatively flat and easy 14 miles to Vernon, NJ where a donation based hostel was waiting. The first two miles flew by and we were in Unionville, where I had a Snickers ice cream bar for breakfast. The front porch of Horler's Grocery was comfortable and inviting, so we lingered for a while and chatted with three ATC Ridgerunners who happened to drop by. The trail out of Unionville wandered around marshy wildlife refuges which were baking hot in the direct sun. It was nearly 90 degrees and I was struggling. The water sources were few and far between, so I was feeling dehydrated. We climbed over Pochuck Mountain, then down into another wildlife refuge. For the last three miles into Vernon, the AT followed popular boardwalks through grasslands. Wawayanda Mountain, the next morning's climb, towered in the distance. It was beautiful and SO hot. I climbed over the final stile, trekked through a cow pasture, and gratefully found a seat in the shade with KT outside a farm store. I bought a lemonade, watermelon, and strawberry ice cream inside and was just digging in when an older man in overalls stopped in front of us.""You girls headed to Vernon?"" He asked.""Yessir.""""Well you better hop on in that truck there,"" pointing at his definitely air conditioned pickup. ""Hurry up, now, an opportunity like this doesn't come along everyday.""We dropped our packs in the bed, then climbed in the backseat. The old couple was charming and friendly, apparently making it a habit to pick up hikers when they stumble upon them. They'd clearly lived in the area forever and waved hello to everyone we passed for two and a half miles to the hostel.""It's a good thing you girls are pretty, I don't normally drop you at the door,"" he said as we pulled up to a beautiful old white church. We thanked them repeatedly and followed the AT signs to the basement hostel.All the lights were off, but two men were watching Titanic in the common room. Weird.We said hello, no response.Weirder.The older man was fast asleep and looked vaguely dead.Weirdest.So we went to the grocery store to resupply.Titanic was still on when we got back, but the younger man had perked up a bit and really taken a shine to KT. I suspect he wasn't a hiker, based on his bizarre behavior, but who knows. He wasn't totally with it and my single-girl-alone-in-the-woods radar began alarming.We went to Dunkin Donuts instead.When we got back to the hostel, a few others had turned up, southbound section hikers. The younger man was asleep in the other room, the older outside on the phone. I snuggled up on a futon, KT took a rollaway bed and I looked forward to a nice night of sleep on a real mattress. But it was not to be. First, the younger man wandered in and settled on the floor not far from me. He'd occasionally get up and wander around, then go back to his spot on the floor, making just enough noise to wake me up. The older man came in after I had fallen asleep. I woke a few hours later to find that he was sleeping up against, actually mostly underneath, the futon where I slept. He rolled over and kicked and shook my futon every few minutes. This was a huge room, a community room the size of a church sanctuary, and he was sleeping on the floor. There were literally hundreds of other places he could have slept, but, there he was. We asked him if he planned to sleep on the futon or bed before we went to bed and he said no, so who knows what was happening here.After a few hours of this, I dragged the heavy piece of furniture four feet across the room so that he couldn't kick it in his sleep, at least. Exhausted, I fell back asleep.Only to be awoken shortly thereafter by the younger guy, who was noisily packing his bag at 5 am. That in itself wasn't totally unusual, and I could've slept through it, if not for the flashlight he was shining directly into my eyes.""You gotta be kidding me,"" I groaned. Thankfully, he took his bag outside eventually and I got about an hour more sleep before everyone else was up and packing their packs.Exhausted, frustrated, and not ready to be back on the trail, I wandered over to the local breakfast joint. Sitting at the counter, I slurped coffee and ate blueberry pancakes. I chatted with the man to my right who was in town for a weekend of mountain biking. He was from South Jersey, a union tradesmen and I enjoyed the relative normalcy of our conversation.Finally, I decided to take a zero day at the hostel, since everyone had cleared out. The last week of heat and lack of sleep was wearing me down and my feet are still in rough shape after the Pennsylvania rocks. So far this afternoon, I have the place to myself and am loving it. I watched Almost Famous on VHS because I've only seen it thirty times. I'm sad to now be a day behind KT and two days behind Roller, but I definitely needed a day to myself and am optimistic I'll be able to sleep through the night and tackle a nice little climb in the morning.","Gren Anderson Shelter

Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537492,"This is going to be a long one, folks. I've been adding to the same insane, stream of consciousness journal entry every day since we last spoke, which was in Vernon, NJ. I'm in Connecticut now. Well, actually, I'm really in Massachusetts, but this post will take you to just before Salisbury, CT.I'd apologize for not posting more often, but, I don't really feel that bad about it.Anyway, read at your own peril: New York to Connecticut Shortly after I posted my last update, a familiar face turned up at the hostel. Portage, who I originally met back at Rausch Gap Shelter when he was with the Young Puppies, had hopped off the shelter for a week to, IDK, graduate from Yale or something. He came in with Greybeard, a representative from ALDHA (Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Association) who gave him a ride from the trail head.Having shared a shelter with Portage in the past, I was reasonably certain he wouldn't crawl under my bed and kick it repeatedly or shine a bright light into my eyes before 5 am, so that was a relief.After a few hours of half watching Comedy Central, Portage and Greybeard both went their separate ways in pursuit of dinner. I was just contemplating doing the same when Melissa, a local trail angel extraordinaire, walked in and offered me a steak dinner at her place. I was eager to take her up on the offer and signed Portage's guestbook on his Trailjournals page, telling him to get his arse back to the hostel for free dinner, which, surprisingly, worked.We drove out past ski resorts and mountain biking parks to Melissa's place, where we got to meet her two brothers and her mom as well. We watched Seinfeld and exchanged crazy trail stories for a while. Melissa has been feeding and helping out hikers for years and has met some interesting characters.With Fast Times at Ridgemont High playing in the background, we dug in to steak, asparagus, and French fries. It was awesome to spend time in a real house with real people!Melissa ferried us back to the hostel way past hiker midnight, but no one else had turned up, so I fell asleep on the futon, reasonably confident that I wouldn't be abruptly awakened by strange strangers in the middle of the night.The next morning, Greybeard graciously offered us a ride back to the trail and, after a breakfast of Dunkin Donuts, I was back in the hot sun, doing what I do best: walking really, really slow.I started up the so-called Stairway to Heaven up Wawayanda Mountain, picking up loads of trash on the way. This area is popular for day hikes and trail running and more people always equals more trash. I accidentally missed the overlook after the long climb. The weather was nuts- 90 degrees with 90% humidity- so I spent the day just pouring sweat and searching for the next water source. I probably drank 7 liters of water, most of which I flavored with one of those Mio additives because it was murky and tasted like a pond otherwise.The trail wrapped around Greenwood Lake, high above it on a rocky ridge line, for most of the day. On this Memorial Day weekend, the lake was packed with boats and, even miles away on the ridge, I could clearly make out the music emanating from the rowdier party boats.I crossed the New Jersey/ New York border that afternoon, beginning my 4th state. Appalachian Trials featured my picture of the occasion in their Instagram and it got approximately 1192 more likes on their page than mine. The heat and humidity was just brutal so I was moving really slow. I stumbled over a rocky outcropping named Cat Rocks right at sunset and lingered for a while before finding the shelter. The tenting area was filled with Weekend Warriors, Portage and two section hikers, Jeff and Noah, were in the shelter. I set up my hammock and scrambled to cook dinner before calling it a night.The next morning I was up at 5:30, out of camp by 7, and over heated and exhausted by 10. The weather was just SO hot. I called mom and Aunt Pam around noon to make my picks for the Indianapolis 500. Mom had picked Rossi and Munoz because they ""looked Italian,"" her worst reason for picking drivers yet, and some how managed to nab a 1-2 finish. Go figure.I was feeling pretty homesick, even teared up a bit when I watched a YouTube clip of Jim Nabors singing Back Home Again in Indiana. I'm not even from Indiana...Anyway, I was feeling pretty glum until I stumbled upon a hearty dose of trail magic- a cooler full of Cokes and snacks from 2015 SOBO Solar Body! That helped a lot but the heat soon overwhelmed me again. The next two road crossings also offered trail magic- a first aid box and bottled water. The water so far in New York has been pretty gross and I already went through 5 liters in the astounding heat. The trail magic was very, very welcome.Harriman State Park was absolutely beautiful and filled to the gills with day hikers. I climbed through a stunning open forest, all big oaks, boulders, and soft green grass. I passed a lovely lake, where I ran into Jeff and Noah, the section hikers I'd met the night before. We'd been leapfrogging all day and they warned me that there was no water at the next shelter. Together, we climbed through the infamous Lemon Squeezer, a narrow crack through a boulder the size of a house. I had to take my pack off and hurl it up on a ledge because it was too wide for the 15 foot long passageway.After that, and an awkward climb over another boulder, there were only half a dozen pointless ups and downs to the shelter.Fingerboard Shelter was full when I arrived, not so much with people as with their trash. 4 drunk college students had made themselves at home, filling the 8 person shelter with half empty jugs of iced tea, beer bottles, and general detritus.""Holy f*ck, you guys!"" I said, tactfully, as I took in the mess. ""Don't worry, we're leaving in the morning!"" A drunk kid in a Tulane hat promised.""And all this,"" I gestured at the disaster, using my best mom voice, ""WILL be going with you?""Any hope of sleeping through the night's rain under a real roof now demolished, I dragged my gear downhill and set up my hammock. The bugs were dreadful, so I skipped cooking dinner. My bear bag line got stuck in a branch and I briefly lost what was left of my cool. But the looming thunderheads meant I had no time for a quality temper tantrum, so I was in my hammock feeling grumpy very soon after my arrival in camp. At about midnight, I heard the drunken kids from the shelter crash through my campsite, who knows why, and traipse about in the nearby forest for a while. Irritated, but also under the influence of a minor sleep medication, I decided not to yell at them and, eventually, fell back asleep instead. It was raining when I woke up in the morning, so I lingered in my tent for a bit. After packing up, I darted down the mountain, eager to reach the Tiorati Lake beach, where my guide book promised vending machines. When you've been hiking in mind boggling heat for a while, paying $3 for an ice cream bar out of a vending machine feels downright reasonable. I had two. And a can of coke, costing a measly $1.75. A sign on the machines defensively claimed that the treats were being sold ""at cost."" I have reason to doubt that claim.Tiorati Lake was crowded with Memorial Day picnickers grilling burgers and swimming in the surprisingly clear water. I people watched as I ate my ice cream and covertly charged my phone. After an hour of this relative luxury, another flip flopping hiker, Nera, arrived and gratefully handed over an exorbitant amount of money for ice cream. I immediately liked Nera, on account of our matching phone cases (hot pink and lime green-the classiest of color combinations), and chatted with her about the usual hiker stuff for a while. Eventually, I begrudgingly shouldered my pack and continued on. A few miles in, I met a friendly day hiker who pulled off his pack and handed over grapes, bell pepper slices, and baby carrots that he made a habit of packing out for passing thru hikers. The bell peppers were a thousand times better than my ice cream brunch.Dancing up the trail to the next shelter (I had my ""good times, great oldies"" playlist on), I stopped to finish off the veggies and ran in to Nera again. She was headed to West Mountain shelter, too, so we agreed to hike the last few miles together. I rarely hike with others, so I had to constantly remind myself not to talk aloud to myself...Up over the next big hill, we caught our first glances of the Hudson River and New York City in the distance. The mountains felt remote and wild but, as we discovered when we dropped down the hill and crossed a busy parkway, we were only 32 miles from the city. The Hudson River valley is breathtaking, rolling hills sprawling in ever direction and cleverly hiding most signs of civilization. Only the astoundingly expansive NYC skyline betrayed that we were surrounded by people. It was a weird sensation, finding solitude while so close to millions and millions of people.West Mountain Shelter is a half mile from the trail, so it is frequently skipped by hikers. The average thru-hiker will happily hike 25 miles in a day, but don't ask them to go more than a tenth of a mile off the trail for anything besides beer or ice cream... As a result, Nera and I had the shelter to ourselves. It was a classic Civilian Conservation Corps stone shelter, built 80 years ago and not much changed since. It sat atop granite boulders overlooking the Hudson River, with the most mind boggling view to the south of New York City. We sat in awe for a very, very long time before beginning any of the usual camp chores. After settling in for the night, a whippoorwill, the worst bird in the entire world, began his relentless hollering from a nearby tree.""Oh no."" I moaned.Nera threw a few rocks at the tree. The whippoorwill fluttered to another tree a few feet away and made even more noise.Nera threw a few more rocks. The whippoorwill ignored her.I contemplated packing up camp and moving on. Whippoorwills are nocturnal, they are loud, and they make for very poor neighbors while camping. Optimistically hoping he'd move on, I snuggled into my bag and put in my earplugs. He didn't move on. After a sleepless eight hours, the sun came up and the whippoorwill went to bed. Nera and I, muttering angrily, packed up camp and headed for Bear Mountain, a popular day hike with a viewing tower and, more importantly, a restaurant in the inn at the bottom. Because Bear Mountain is so popular, the trail was wide, paved with crushed gravel, and had stairs on every climb. Real stairs, too, not the chaotic stacks of boulders that some trail maintainers like to pretend are stairs. We picked up a lot of trash- with crowds come garbage (Incidentally, the people of New York love Poland Spring bottled water)- and happily dumped it in the huge trash cans available at the summit. There were more expensive vending machines by the viewing tower, so we snacked on Pringles and watched the Hudson River do very little for a while. The view from Bear Mountain was almost as incredible as from West Mountain shelter, plus there were benches and no whippoorwills. The descent, meticulously paved with tedious stairs, took much longer than it should have, but the Cuban sandwich and fries waiting at the base of the hill made it worth it. I debated for a while between taking a nearo at Bear Mountain to do laundry and shower or pushing on another 7 miles to the next campsite. Nera ordered a beer and that made up my mind for me. I followed suit and we began researching hotel options. We ultimately decided on the Holiday Inn Express next to West Point and agreed to call a cab. But first, another 3/4 of a mile of the AT- through the Bear Mountain zoo.I don't know who decided to run the trail through the middle of the zoo, but I appreciate that decision. It was thoroughly entertaining. All of the animals were injured or otherwise disabled and couldn't be returned to the wild. The fox ignored us, as did the vaguely tragic looking bald eagle. I only glanced at the Timber Rattlesnakes and Copperheads- I've seen enough of their compatriots in the wild, thank you very much. The Bears were comical- one sat, Winnie the Pooh style, playing with an empty food bowl while the other lazed in a bear sized hammock, only opening his eyes when he sensed one of the buzzards getting too close to him. He would swat at the ugly birds with one paw, they would hop a few feet away, then he'd be back asleep within minutes.A taxi picked whisked us away to a bizarrely swanky Holiday Inn, the kind that gave you fresh baked cookies at check in. They wouldn't give Nera the military discount, since she just retired, which I found odd... I mean, she had just served her country for 28 years... Anyway, I snuggled into the big, smushy bed after a long, luxurious shower and half watched American Pie on HBO for a while.We did laundry and floated in the strangely warm indoor pool for a bit. Finally, we trekked down to the pizza place/ ice cream joint for Margherita pizza and spumoni. The family who ran the place were classic Brooklyn, with names like Big Tony and accents that didn't even sound real. They were a bit confused by the concept of thruhiking, but we finally convinced them that, yes, we had walked here from West Virginia and, no, we didn't have a car. They thought this was insane. I can't blame them.One of the American Pie sequels was on when we got back to the hotel, but I fell asleep pretty quickly. The next morning, Nera was eager to be back on the trail. I was not. We compromised and ended up back at the zoo around 9 am, after an oversized continental breakfast. I was feeling pretty low, really really didn't want to be hiking, so I let Nera go on without me and settled on to a bench to call my mom and whine for a bit. Hiking isn't always fun. It's also rarely easy. This particular day, all I could think about was the heat, the discomfort, everything that makes hiking hard. I was homesick, I was perilously close to bus and train stations that could get me home, and I didn't want to walk anymore.Eventually, I convinced myself to take it easy, just hike the seven miles to Graymoor Spiritual Center, a Franciscan monastery that allows hikers to camp in their ball field (why does a monastery need a baseball field?) for free. It was hot, it was hilly, but I had some twelve hours to go only seven miles, so there was no pressure. I listened to newly downloaded podcasts and picked up several bags of trash. I stopped at a deli to buy ice cream. There, I met three other thru-hikers that Melissa, the NJ trail angel, and had mentioned were right behind me. Haz No Horse is a pro- 72 years old and absolutely flying down the trail- he started March 18th, later than every other NOBO I'd met so far by at least two weeks. P Stout and Sorority Steve were younger guys, splitting a half gallon of ice cream after finishing their giant sandwiches. It was an impressive amount of food.I slowly wandered up the trail to Graymoor and set up camp, hanging my hammock in a prime spot and showering in the icy outdoor shower. The others arrived shortly after, as did a young girl, freshly graduated from Walnut Hills High School in Cincy and solo hiking to Maine. Kudos to her. I wouldn't have been able to solo hike 700 miles when I was 18. Santa and Wonder, a pair of Massachusetts teachers, and two others from PA turned up later. Three section hikers arrived, too, two older guys headed south and QB, who would finally be completing the trail in a few days. We made up a good sized crowd and ordered a few big, greasy NY style pizzas, delivered by a very confused driver to the monastery. I slept under the stars that night- first night with a zero percent chance of rain in five weeks- and woke up to a glorious sunrise. Everyone else was up and at 'em shockingly early- camp was almost clear by 6 am. I don't like hiking early in the morning, so I savored a cup of coffee and followed them at a more reasonable time. My knee was still sore from a few days earlier and my feet were in bad shape, so I planned another short-ish day- some 13 miles to Canopus Lake, where one can camp at the state park campground for free. I took my time, focusing on enjoying myself instead of hiking fast or keeping up with others. The trail took me through beautiful forests, past beaver bogs, and along an old road that used to lead to local iron mines. It was pretty cool, elevated above the forest floor on stacked boulders. I found myself in a sunny clearing at a road crossing in the middle of the day, settling in for lunch, when an enormous truck towing a shiny new Airstream camper pulled up. Out came Rain and Sprinkle, who Nera had told me about. Rain hikes and Sprinkle meets him at strategic road crossings with the Airstream. Sounds like a great set up to me!Rain offered me a beer from the enormous cooler in the truck, which I happily took him up on, and Sprinkle insisted on setting up a camp chair for me to rest in. I luxuriated there for a while, Sprinkle left to drop Rain at a trailhead about 7 miles back. I finally strapped on my boots and started moving again, feeling rejuvenated by the dose of trail magic. Around 5, I crossed the 400 mile mark, then dropped down the ridge to the campground. Said campground had a shower. A hot one. I spent an ungodly amount of time there, then set up camp, savoring the feeling of being clean, the setting sun, and my camp dinner. There were no other hikers at the campground, just a few car campers. I listened, entertained, to a couple with incredible Staten Island accents fight over their campfire. I was asleep in the hammock by 8:30.The next morning, I again took my time breaking camp. I hate being rushed in the morning and was again doing a short day- 14 miles this time. Plus, it was drizzling and foggy. Walking back to the trail through the deserted beach, I stopped to take my 400 mile picture, then up the hill I went. Writing about it a few days later, I can't remember much about the details of this day, just snippets here and there, but I remember thoroughly enjoying it. I love hiking slow, I love hiking alone. It may not make for particularly great stories, but it makes for a happy hiker, so I'll take it. I must've taken a lot of long breaks, because it took me upwards of nine hours to hike those 14 miles. Lunch that day was at the famed RPH cabin, a cinder block house that the local club turned into a shelter, complete with bunks, delivery pizza, and a well stocked hiker supply box. At the shelter, I met a fascinating couple, southbounding from Vermont to Georgia. When I arrived, they were playing metal on one of their cell phones, but they quickly opted for a slightly less offensive 80s rock station. They were zeroing there, which they apparently do whenever it rains, on account of their not having rain gear. Their packs were enormous, stuffed with all manner of fascinating things, like the world's largest backpacking stove, some ten pounds of fuel, and the biggest bag of loose tobacco I've ever seen in my life. They sat at the picnic table rolling cigarettes with the cigarette rolling machine that they apparently carry with them and talked non-stop. I enjoyed this, though they talked so fast I couldn't get much a word in. She must've rolled hundreds of cigarettes as we sat there, her partner smoking them almost as quick as she rolled them. We discussed all the usual trail stuff- beer and mutual acquaintances and which mountains were best and gear choices- until I had to move on. I snagged a few freeze dried meals from the hiker box so I wouldn't have to go to town to resupply, and headed for the next shelter. There was also a deli just off the trail, about 4 miles before the shelter. I ordered enough food to feed a family, then happily wasted an hour reading, charging my phone, and savoring my grape soda. I had picked up a cheesy mystery novel from the RPH hiker box and found it downright thrilling.The evening passed quietly, just me and a NOBO named HareBear. My hammock was hung in a cozy clearing just below the shelter and I slept well, despite the fog and 99% humidity.The trouble with my luxurious hammock set up is that the dark forest green rainfly blocks out the early morning sunshine, so I quite easily sleep later than a respectable thruhiker should. As such, HareBear was packed up and leaving camp by the time I stumbled out of bed. I felt awesome, sprightly and well rested. The short days meant my joints were repairing themselves and I wasn't feeling any residual fatigue. Sleeping in the hammock instead of shelters helped too, I'm sure.I started around 8 am, comfortably hiking about a mile per hour faster than usual. The trail was a delight- meticulously maintained, wide and flatish and rockless. I had stuffed myself silly at the deli the day before and packed in a fresh baked blueberry muffin for breakfast, so I was probably not in a calorie deficit for the first time in weeks.The first ten miles flew by. I stopped at a shelter close to a road crossing for lunch. A group of high school boys turned up shortly thereafter, visibly disappointed to see me there. They decided to go smoke pot behind the shelter anyway. I was half tempted to narc on them just for being such unfriendly little shitheads, but I was in too good a mood. The shelter had a tiny free library where some lovely hiker abandoned peanut butter and tortillas, providing me with a nice lunch and sparing me a resupply for another day. I lounged there, shoes off and probably vaguely stoned from the secondhand smoke, for a while. Eventually a LASH (long ass section hiker) named Warrior turned up, followed closely by Rain. Warrior had been hiking with the Young Pups, who I've mentioned here before, so we spent a while swapping stories.My favorite goes thusly:At Eckville Shelter, back in PA, Frost and I were discussing trail magic. Frost detailed a particularly awesome dose of magic he'd received a while back.""Wow, I've never gotten anything as good as that."" I said, envious.Frost stared at me for a bit, then said, seriously and with a perfectly straight face, ""well, I am A LOT prettier than you.""I stared back at him for a moment, ""touché,"" I finally conceded. Anyway, I finally put my shoes back on and ventured back to the trail. It descended quickly into a pastoral valley, home to the Dover Oak, the biggest, oldest tree on the AT, at 300 years old and 22 feet around. Next, I zig zagged around beautiful pastureland, thoroughly enjoying the open vistas and compulsively checking for ticks every 200 feet. The trail ducked into the woods for a moment, where I met Sprinkle, on her way to intersect with Rain. Next, the trail followed a boardwalk through marshes teeming with red winged black birds and bullfrogs. Two older ladies stopped me to chat for a while. They were sweet and seemed terribly impressed by my solo hiking. I liked them a lot for this. Eventually they bade me good luck and I continued on, reaching the Appalachian Trail train station. It was tempting to stay there and catch the next train to Grand Central, but it was too beautiful a day to waste on a city. I stopped briefly for ice cream and canister fuel at a Hiker friendly native plant nursery (strange combination, I know, but more importantly, there were Klondike bars). At the next road crossing, a huge container of treats had been magicked into being by Santa and Wonder, who I'd met a few days back and had hopped off the trail for a quick visit home. ""Everything's coming up Millhouse!"" I said to myself as I snacked on my new bag of Teddy Grahams. The next road crossing also offered trail magic- big jugs of water. There were also four baby raccoons hanging out there, doing whatever it is raccoons do at road crossings on Saturday afternoon. When they saw me coming they took off for the nearest tree, and I happily watched them climb the tree for a while.I climbed a rickety stile over an electric fence (eek!) into a field of dairy cows, who watched me with casual alarm. I called out a greeting to them. In the way cows are wont to do, they ignored my greeting, instead ambling politely away, as if I was a possibly crazy lady in a grocery store and they were pretending to need pickles just to get away from me. Another stile, another electric fence, and I was in the Pawling Nature Preserve, climbing up out of the valley. I was still flying, despite my many breaks, which meant I'd reach the next shelter around 5. The next shelter was only four miles further. I debated the relative merits of both options, but when I hit the next shelter and found a sketchy looking guy there alone, my mind was made up and I hastily continued on. Down a big hill, across a beautiful stream, I hit the metaphorical wall. I probably should have eaten something when I reached the last shelter. I hastily wrapped a tortilla around a granola bar (judge away) and chowed down, sitting smack in the middle of the trail. Onwards.I barreled over the last climb of the day, two miles in a half hour, tossed my pack into the shelter and darted down to the river to soak my feet. HareBear was there, too, and soon followed suit. After a while, my growling stomach beat out my aching feet (did I mention I ended up hiking 22 miles this day?) and I went to cook dinner. Warrior had arrived and was somewhat awkwardly bathing over at the well. I started cooking my dinner, then knocked over the pot. I cooked a second meal.The forecast called for rain, so I snuggled in to the shelter between HareBear and Warrior. A spider took a liking to my sleeping bag and paid the ultimate price for trespassing. I was up at 5, watching the rain from the shelter as HareBear packed up and took off. I did the same, shouldering my pack and pulling in my rain gear. The rain gear was off within a half mile. As long as it's above 65 degrees, I'd rather just get wet than sweat under a layer of nylon. Warrior caught up to me at a road crossing where an ancient RV sat waiting. Onesimus, a former thruhiker and long time traveling trail angel with a brilliant white ponytail and a hand rolled cigarette, popped his head out and offered us a soda. Dripping wet and steaming from the rain, Warrior and I settled gratefully into the RV, accepting cokes and ice cream sandwiches despite the early hour. Onesimus talked for a while about Baltimore Jack, a trail legend who recently passed away. He talked about other trail celebrities, goofy hikers he'd met over the years, and his favorite sections of trail. After a bit, we said our goodbyes, as there was a very large hill to climb, and he promised he'd see us again soon. Up, up, up we climbed. The view at the top featured only fog. Walking through clouds, we went down for a while, then back up, then down, and so on and so forth for ten miles. I was on my final descent before the town of Kent when I saw a familiar face walking towards me. Can you guess who it was? It was KT! For future reference, in these situations , the answer is always KT. She had hopped off the trail to get a new pack, which she now showed off to me. It was a thing of beauty, especially considering the bedraggled old pack she had been fighting with since I met her. She had just been dropped off minutes before and was headed to the shelter, only 1/4 mile back, to wait out the rain. I promised to see her again soon, then slipped and slid the rest of the way down the hillside. Pennsylvania had destroyed the tread on my boots, so wet granite was very nearly impassable for me.I walked into Kent, Connecticut, past the very fancy boarding school- one of three in the tiny town- that was hosting graduation. I chatted for a bit with the state troopers ostensibly directing traffic, then retreated to Kent's outfitters/ice cream shop, where I found Warrior devouring a hot dog. I did the same. Apparently there were some issues in the town with hikers and Kent has developed a reputation for being particularly hiker unfriendly, but we spent quite a while at the outfitters, waiting out the rain. Warrior took off while I was still nursing a pot of tea. I stared at the map and discovered that I could road walk along the Housatonic River until it rejoined the AT and skip the treacherous St Anthony's Staircase. Purists may consider this cheating, but I considered the state of my boots and my knees and decided on the less risky option. I'm glad I did, because it meant I reached the shelter two hours before Warrior. We shared it with two SOBO section hikers. The four of us huddled under cover and watched the rain all evening, eventually falling into an uneasy sleep. Four baby birds in their nest between two roof beams kept us company.As is always the case when I try to sleep in shelters, I was up early. I breakfasted on cold coffee and poptarts and was out of the shelter by 6:45. This was a bad decision. I am not a morning person. I was not yet mentally prepared to hike. Plus, as the first one on the trail that morning, I had to break through the spiderwebs. Muttering in completely unnecessary rage, I followed the Housatonic River on what was actually a beautiful piece of trail. In a flower filled meadow, I startled a doe, who theatricality leaped away. Still grumpy, the pack came off and I stood, gnawing on a Snickers bar in the trail, reevaluating my plan to hike 21 miles. Warrior passed me as I stood and I was happy to let him go ahead. He could take a turn with the spiderwebs.The trail met a road, then a bustling mountain stream. Impossible to rock hop, it required fording instead. I am of the opinion that wet socks are the worst things ever, so I opted to ford barefoot. From a boulder on the other side, I watched in quiet amusement as two section hikers tried to do the same. It involved a lot of almost falling over. I was enjoying boulder sitting more than I had been enjoying hiking that morning, so there I sat for a while, quietly judging section hikers on their fording styles and reading a book.Eventually, I got it together enough to climb my next peak. I took the blue blazed trail to the summit, then wandered back to the trail. And so it went all day, until I finally descended into a beautiful pine forest and set up camp. I was 7 miles shy of my original destination and didn't care in the slightest. I watched a few particularly sassy songbirds dig for snacks and cooked a dinner of my own (roasted songbird, yum!). I enjoyed the bizarre, wall less privy, just a box with a toilet seat at the end of the trail. I went to bed at a reasonable hour. I'll write about my nearo day in Salisbury in my next post.","St. Thomas Episcopal Church Hostel

Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546646,"Hello loves,It's been a long time. Like, 900 miles, since you heard from me last. But, despite popular assumption, I am on trail, some 800 miles from Springer Mountain. If you've seen my Instagram or Facebook you know I summited Katahdin and finished the NOBO half of my journey on August 1st. Since then, I took a week off to explore the eastern seaboard with Mama and Papa Bee then rejoined my hiking partners Keebler and Sin Nombre in Harper's Ferry. We've hiked through Northern Virginia and the Shenandoahs so far. At the moment we're holed up at Stanimals Hostel in Waynesboro because Keeb and Sin Nombre broke themselves. There aren't many other southbound hikers out here, as we're ahead of the SOBO and Flip-flopping crowd, plus I am quite fond of these two busted SOBs, so I'm sticking with them until they are un-busted enough to keep hiking. You all may be saying, ""Rigby, who the eff are these guys? You never mentioned them before."" Fair enough, I have been a WEE bit lax on updating you regularly. My bad. Allow me to introduce you and perhaps give you some background.Sin Nombre and I met on the summit of Mt. Greylock in Massachusetts. We've hiked together, on and off, ever since. He's our troubadour, with an infuriating and fascinating ability to think of a song for everything. He has the sassiest eye roll on the AT and, bonus, I genuinely haven't looked at a guidebook since I started hiking with him. He's the other founding member of the Cuben Fiber Luddites ™, our crew, who are totes #squadgoals. Cuben Fiber Luddites is a hilarious name, by the way, so if you don't get the joke, just play along. I'm extremely lucky to have found him. It's been over 700 miles and I'm not quite sick of him yet.Keebler, our little elf, joined the crew a bit later. I picked him up in the White Mountains, after I got separated from Sin Nombre and the gang in Hanover. We hiked together for a few days, then I lost and found him a few more times. Eventually, he stuck around, due to lack of better options, so he's one of us now. He's a Horticulturist and a Gentleman, our go to for all things bug, critter, and plant related. Ask him about helgramites if you ever meet him. My favorite thing about these two is that they're polar opposites on virtually every point. Literally, the only thing they have in common is their height, but each thinks they're taller than the other and therefore refers to the other as ""the little guy,"" affectionately, of course.My thruhike has evolved since we spoke last. I've hiked some of the most incredible mountains imaginable. Summited breath taking, staggering, mind boggling peaks. Been caught above treeline in a hail storm, chased bears and moose away from my hammock. All of those things have been memorable, but it's the people I've met that stick with me most. Sitting around campfires with wonderful, eccentric weirdos all drawn to the wilderness to share an insane experience. They're my favorite thing about the trail. They're the stories I most enjoy telling.As I have time, I promise to go back and post all my half-written stories from the north. There's a spectacular cast of characters to write about, I'm sure everyone will enjoy them. They're why I don't journal anymore, actually. I'm too busy spending time with them. I'm actually going to sign off now so I can do just that, because Keeb and Sin Nombre are downstairs watching The Revenant with Chatterbox and Don Quixote.","Waynesboro, VA

Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546752,"Let's go back in time a bit, to my adventures in Massachusetts. It was an interesting state:When I last left you, I was on my way into Salisbury, Connecticut. Salisbury is a distinctly charming town, freakishly similar to the fictional village of Stars Hollow from that seminal classic WB show Gilmore Girls. There's a big white inn in the middle of town, a quirky family owned grocery store that I can imagine being owned by a blustering bald man in a sweater vest a la Taylor Doose, and a cast of friendly eccentrics who greeted me from their benches as I passed. There were cluttered antique stores, a pharmacy that hadn't changed since the forties, and multiple oddly specific coffee shops. A woman who didn't see me at the crosswalk stopped her car to apologize for driving through. My first stop was the Post Office, where Mama Bee sent my next care package and the good people of REI shipped a new pair of boots. The postmaster greeted me.""You don't smell like a thruhiker.""I accepted this highest of compliments with as much grace as I could muster. He told me a few of his favorite smelly hiker anecdotes, then went off in search of my packages. I handed him my ID, the picture taken in the good old long haired, tweezed eyebrows, still owned mascara days. ""This person doesn't look crazy enough to hike the trail,"" the venerable postmaster informed me.I assume that meant I now looked sufficiently crazy. He handed over the packages.Seated outside on the sidewalk, I eagerly pawed through my new arrivals- freeze dried Pad Thai, brand new socks, all the luxuries a hiker could hope for- and answered questions from the passing old-timers, the only people who still go to the post office. After hastily stuffing my new gear into my pack and finding the cleverly disguised trash can (the people of Salisbury like to cover everything in flowers), I called a legendary Trail Angel named Vanessa to ask for a bunk for the night. She invited me to come over immediately and greeted me at the front door of her cozy 300 year old house in an apron. Her hiker room featured bunk beds with matching bedspreads, her shower had the water pressure of a power washer, and she immediately took my dirty laundry. I was in heaven. It was like visiting your grandma, if your grandma happened to be a private chef with two enormous dogs that followed her everywhere. Shortly after I arrived, a fellow hiker named Wolverine turned up. We quickly stumbled upon the awkward fact of his being a Michigan alum (thus the trail name) whilst I was wearing an Ohio State logo. We agreed to disagree, let sleeping dogs lie, as it were, and set off for the grocery store. Outside the store, I stumbled upon a few of the famous Young Pups, last spotted in PA- Warrior was seated with Frost and Rainman at a table on the green. Frost offered a fist.""Really, we're fist bumping right now?""""Terrorist handshake,"" he informed me.We shot the breeze for a few minutes, but my stomach was grumbling, so I soon ducked into the store. After dropping a pretty penny on every fresh fruit I could find, I retreated to Vanessa's. She offered Wolverine and I beers and pizza, which we gratefully accepted, then we discussed typical trail stuff for the rest of the night.I slept like a baby, waking refreshed but eager for coffee. We packed our bags, then wandered down to a coffee shop for breakfast with the locals. After discussing architecture- more specifically, the difficulties of being an architect- for a bit, Wolverine ventured back to the grocery store and I retreated to a conference room in town hall to charge my phone and journal. I am dangerously reliant on Yelp, which told me to go eat lunch at the aforementioned White Hart Inn, so there I ventured, hoping to avoid the threatening thunderheads rolling in. When I reached The Taproom, their bar, I discovered two southbound section hikers, Gypsy Toes and Little Foot, laughing raucously with the bartender. Half a beer later, I was laughing hysterically with them. They were the kind of people that made new best friends wherever they went and never ran out of stories. At one point, I was so distracted by them that I accidentally dumped an entire bottle of ketchup on my plate. The bartender and other hikers teased me mercilessly, briefly renaming me Heinz. After a few hours, we determined that the supposed thunderstorms were not actually going to turn up and reluctantly shouldered our packs once again. As soon as we stepped outside, the rain started. We stared out at the sideways rain in fury. The laughing bartender offered us a ride back to the trail as soon as the rain stopped, which we took her up on.I finally hit the trail at four pm and began a long, gradual climb up to the first shelter, famed for its awesome sunrise views. It was cold, like, really really cold. Wolverine and I shared the shelter with a Ridgerunner from the local trail club and two French Canadians known as the Yellow Birds, who asked me delightful questions like, ""why is it cold?"" and ""what is a Dollar General?"" in their endearing accents for much of the evening.I woke up to watch the sunrise, then fell asleep again for a few hours, making me the last person out of camp. I climbed a big ole mountain, Bear Mountain, the highest peak in Connecticut, then dropped into a beautiful gorge, featuring a luxurious hemlock forest and a mountain stream tumbling over mossy boulders and into deep swimming holes that I would've thoroughly enjoyed, except it was barely 50 degrees outside. After lunch on a boulder, I crossed the state line into Massachusetts. I tried to take a selfie with the sign, but that didn't end well, so instead I just scrawled something pithy about the Romney family in the register and kept going. Up and over Mt. Race, boom, I climbed my first Massachusetts mountain. For about half a mile, the trail follows narrow rock ledges on the ridgeline. The views were breathtaking; real mountains, big ones, as far as the eye could see in every direction. I had found the Berkshires. I stopped to FaceTime with Mama Bee, so she could see the mountains in real time. As we talked, a thruhiker I didn't recognize walked up and greeted me:""Rigby! Hey! I haven't seen you since [mumble].""""Yeaaah, hey you, how are ya?""This went on for a few moments. Finally, I had to ask, ""sorry, what's your name?""""Backbone! It's okay, you were really drunk last time I met you.""My mother was still on the line.I immediately remembered Backbone, we met briefly at The Doyle, in Duncannon, PA. He was one of the hikers who had been sucked into the vortex for several days and were at least three sheets to the wind when I dropped in around noon. I therefore bristled at the suggestion I had been the drunk one.""I'm about 95% sure you were the drunk one, you look different, more sober and clean now,"" I joked.He laughed and continued on. Mom looked at me suspiciously. ""He was the drunk one, I swear."" Eventually, after a failed attempt to FaceTime with my golden retriever, I said goodbye to Mama and continued to the summit. Backbone was there and we hiked together over Mt. Everett, whose summit was completely obscured by a gaggle of preteens, and down to the next shelter. Massachusetts is famous for its big loft and bunk style shelters that comfortably sleep 10. The Yellow Birds were already in the loft, Backbone and the Ridgerunner from last night each took a bottom bunk. Rather than settle into the middle of that smelly snore fest, I set up my hammock. A few minutes later, a middle aged man arrived.""How many people are in the shelter?"" He demanded.We told him. ""Oh, well I have a group of thirteen kids [the summit obscuring gaggle from before] and we were hoping to get the shelter.""None of us moved. Groups aren't supposed to sleep in shelters, everyone knew that. Especially not groups of kids, because they tend to suck. In other news, your not supposed to hike in groups that big, given the environmental impact and general obnoxiousness.He stared at us for a bit, as if we would all decide to pack up and move on for his benefit.""There's another shelter with plenty of tenting [emphasis on tenting here] only .1 miles from here."" The ridge runner said helpfully.""I'm well aware of that,"" our new friend snapped, ""we were really hoping for this shelter.""We remained unmoved and he finally left, grumbling. The Ridgerunner mentioned that he should probably go figure out what organization the guy was with so they could have an official discussion about the rules of the trail, but instead he stayed in his sleeping bag. I can't blame him.It was cold again, so I happily stayed in my hammock, reading a freaky thriller about multiple psychopaths, until 9 am. I expected everyone to be long gone, but Backbone is apparently as big a slacker as I am and was still in his sleeping bag. He did manage to convince me to do 18 miles that day, despite the late hour, so, after practicing yoga handstands and generally dicking around for a bit longer, we left the shelter together. I've mentioned before that I don't hike with other people often. I tend to stop and stare at space at inconvenient times, I'm always picking up trash, and I ALWAYS have to pee, but none of this seemed to phase Backbone, so we hiked most of the day together. He talked a lot, and I gotta say, he's a real interesting character. In addition to doing yoga, he enjoys Jui Jitsu, Spartan races, collecting knives, teaching rifle and Revolutionary War history classes, and Anarchist philosophy. If you know me well, you can imagine how I reacted to some of these conversations.Late in the evening, having let Backbone go on ahead, I passed a field of goats who bleated at me and ran for cover. I assume they thought I was a bear or mountain lion or something. I then journeyed around a stunning lake, with the sun setting on the far side. Then mom pocket dialed me while bragging about me at a cocktail party. Finally, I followed rocky ledges along a ridgeline and watched the sun set. Incredibly, even though I reached the shelter at 8:30 on a Friday night, we were the only people there. I immediately claimed the loft in order to get out of the ferocious wind. The next morning, Backbone got it together enough to leave early, since he had a package waiting in Tyringham and the post office closed at noon. I happily did NOT move until at least 9 am, then ventured out into the world. The trail down from Mt. Wilcox would've been a nice hike, if not for the torrential rain that struck shortly after I began walking. The rain fell sideways in heavy sheets, thunder crashed, and the trail quickly flooded. I wrapped my torso and backpack in my poncho tarp and resigned myself to being otherwise soaked. Since my boots were saturated, I splashed in puddles. Whenever the rain got heavier, I'd turn my face heavenward and dared Mother Nature to ""bring it, bitch."" Fighting the rain is an exercise in utter futility. After a few hours, Mama Nature wore herself out and settled instead for being dreary and cold. I stopped to call Mary, one of my bestest buds from home but soon had to continue on in the name of not-becoming-hypothermic. Around 5:30, I finally reached the half mile spur trail to Upper Goose Pond Cabin, the most magical place on earth. The little red cabin was donated to the National Park Service and is now maintained for thru-hikers and locals to enjoy. In the bunkhouse- complete with mattresses and therefore better than many hostels- I found Backbone and two section hikers snuggled into their bags in an effort to shake the chill from their bones. Downstairs, the volunteer caretaker, Bambi, and her two dogs (one of which was a pony sized wolfhound) greeted me from their spots by the roaring fire. I was in love with this place, even the rowdy Cub Scouts whose valiant efforts to filter water kept me entertained as I cooked dinner. The sun peeked through the beleaguered rain clouds, so we enjoyed a stunning sunset from the dock.The next morning, Bambi made us all pancakes and coffee, a proud UGP Cabin tradition, and I washed dishes with a friendly section hiker out back. There's no electricity or running water, so the water for dishes is boiled over the gas stove and poured into large rubber tubs. Backbone had suggested a zero day at the cabin, so I was content to find a seat and a book after breakfast chores. Later in the morning, we took the canoe out to the island in the center of the pond. Backbone insisted upon steering, despite the fact that he had no idea how, so there were quite a few unscheduled detours on the way. The wind was ferocious, which didn't help, but we eventually made it to the island and ate second breakfast on a boulder. Next, we paddled, circuitously because Backbone said ""he was getting the hang of it"" when I offered to steer, to the spring on the opposite side of the pond and filled 30 gallon jugs for the cabin. The caretakers normally do this once a day, but we offered to take on the chore as payment for our otherwise free zero day. By the time we made it back to the cabin and lugged all 30 jugs uphill to the porch (all the while being watched suspiciously by bewildered picnickers) Bambi was packed up and ready to leave. Her tenure as volunteer caretaker was over and she was replaced by Nancy, a certified badass from Maine who winter camps and is vegan and teaches math. We all settled in for a chilly afternoon inside and listened with amusement as a gaggle of NOBOs played chess and told fart jokes. They moved on to catch a ride into town for the weekend and Backbone, Nancy, and a section hiked named Trotter spent the evening discussing vegan food. I read Under the Banner of Heaven as they debated the best multivitamins to hike with. My only contribution to the conversation went thusly: ""You know, Poptarts ARE fortified.""I was met with stony silence, not even a polite chuckle and therefore went to bed early. Vegans.I hiked another few days with Backbone, including an entertaining resupply and town stop in Dalton. Backbone spent a mind boggling $130 on food at the fancy grocery store, despite having received a full resupply in the mail, then burned a similar amount of funds at the liquor store. On our way out of town, we happened upon the famous Dented Bear Canister, Rain and Sprinkle's airstream. Sprinkle had just returned from a shopping trip and offered both of us a beer, which we gratefully accepted. We chatted for almost an hour, then scurried up to a campsite to set up before sunset. The next morning, I discovered Backbone drinking some of his liquor store haul outside his tent and debating gun control laws with another hiker and, therefore, carried on without him. That day, I hiked over the Cheshire Rocks, with incredible views of the town of Cheshire and Mt Greylock across the valley. After a quick stop to pick up an amazing care package that Wendy mailed me, I started up the long slow climb to the summit of Greylock, the highest mountain in Massachusetts. It was a beautiful day and a beautiful hike, so I took my time. I reached the crowded peak (there's an auto road to the top) and spent a lot of time trying to explain thruhiking to a gaggle of elderly tourists. I was saved by the appearance of two fellow flip floppers, Chickenfoot and Disco, who I'd been following for weeks. They're a super cool couple from Indianapolis, but poor Chickenfoot had contracted Lyme disease and was struggling mightily to hike through the misery of doxycycline. I decided to stop for the night at the lodge on the summit, despite it being fairly early, so I paid up for a bunk in the hiker room. There was only one other hiker there, a NOBO named Ghost. We spent the evening sampling Massachusetts beers and swapping trail stories on the back porch while the regular tourists listened to a lengthy educational program about the Civilian Conservation Corps and ate their high-budget dinner. Ghost earned his trail name for his tendency to roll in late to camp, then leave early in the morning, so people never actually see him. But, the next morning he stuck around until eight, about 4 hours later than usual, because the inn promised free breakfast. We were both up at five and struggled to kill 3 hours before the dining room opened. When we finally gained admission, we were disappointed to find a meager snack of thoroughly crappy muffins and weak coffee. Chagrined, we each hoarded away three muffins before the tourists woke up, then headed out together. As we crossed the summit, we met another thru-hiker, Sin Nombre, who I instantly disliked (don't worry, he already knows this. My more astute fans will remember that I've been hiking with SN ever since this day) and continued on. Ghost and I hiked down to the crossroads to North Adams and Williamstown together and said our adieus, as he was hopping off trail to meet a friend and I had a resupply to do. North Adams has hilarious, junky loaner bikes for thruhikers to use, so I snagged one and peddled to Williamstown for a can of fuel and an Indian buffet near the college. As per usual, the host at the restaurant seated me as far away as possible from the other diners. Considering the whole place smelled like curry AND I had just showered at Greylock the night before, I was mildly miffed, but I guess that hiker stank never really goes away...Anyway, after lunch, it was back to the grocery store in North Adams, where I found Sin Nombre, Chickenfoot, and Disco lounging on the definitely-up-for-sale display furniture outside the store. Seated with them was what appeared to be a grizzled shrimp boat captain wearing the most tragically abused pair of used-to-be-pink swim trunks you've ever seen. He was using a whole pack of bologna and a loaf of white bread to make and consume some eight sandwiches. This was, as I soon discovered, the legendary Otis. Backbone had met him back in Virginia and looked up to him as some kind of hero. He even had a video of him at a shelter on his phone that he showed to everyone he met. When I told Otis this, he responded ""Backbone? Do I know a Backbone? I've never heard of him."" Which I obviously found hilarious. After spending a bit of time with this crew, I went to retrieve my pack and hit the trail again. A few miles in, I hit the Vermont border and the beginning of the Long Trail, the oldest footpath in America, which the AT follows for about 100 miles. Like my crossing into Massachusetts (and every other state to date) I happened to be alone, so I snapped a selfie and set foot into my next state.","Salisbury, CT

Rigby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551450,"I stopped at the first shelter in Vermont, Seth Warner Shelter, to find it positively overflowing with NOBOs, Flip floppers, Long Trailers, and all manner of Sectioners. As I wandered down the blue blaze to the shelter, I first came across a cheerful guy trying and failing repeatedly to hang a bear bag. He grinned and informed me that he was really scared of bears. I nodded politely and continued on. Upon reaching the shelter clearing, I was greeted by another stranger, this one with a magnificent beard and sweet southern drawl. He introduced himself as Whiskers.""You're Whiskers! I'm Rigby!! I'm so stoked to finally meet you!"" I damn near shouted.Whiskers and I had been Instagram buddies since before either of us started hiking. He takes awesome pictures and his beard is even better in real life than in pictures. ""You're the sleeping bag girl?"" Another stranger, this one a grinning girl with a buzzed head, interjected. After a moment of confusion, I realized she was referring to the heinous muddy sleeping bag I dragged off a peak in Connecticut. ""Whiskers told us all about you, I'm so glad you're finally meeting! I'm Bubbles.""""And I'm Sprout,"" her husband added.""You guys are Bubbles and Sprout?!?!"" I enthusiastically again damn near shouted, ""I've been following you since Harper's Ferry!""Thoroughly excited to have hit a little bubble of fellow flip floppers, I scrambled to find a hammock site. It was a struggle, given that at least another 20 people had the same idea. As I set up camp near the cheerful, bear-fearing guy, who then asked me to come check his bear line, Sin Nombre, Chickenfoot, Disco, and a gang of four NOBOs piled in to camp.I cooked dinner with the new gang, then retreated to hang my own bear bag, which involved the breaking of three different branches before Whiskers politely intervened to help me find a not-dead tree. In mild humiliation, I prepared for bed. The bear-fearing fellow, whose name I didn't know but now feared it was too late to ask, lowered his voice and covertly offered me a beer. ""I brought four to share, since it's my first night out here-"" he was hiking the Long Trail- ""but I'm not sure of the etiquette when there's this many people at the shelter.""I accepted, gratefully, and we sat chatting until far past the customary hiker bedtime. He was a fascinating guy, worked in the sustainability industry in Burlington, VT and had the incredible ability to at least feign interest in whatever I said. The next morning, as we all packed up camp, my new pal discovered with great chagrin that he had lost his spoon. All hands on deck, we searched in vain for his spoon. Whiskers instead found, on a shelf in the shelter, a bizarre hybrid contraption, half spoon, half spatula, that he gifted to the Long Trailer to replace his missing utensil. And so our new friend received his first dose of trail magic AND his trail name, Spüüntula. Spüüntula and I hiked part of the day together. He comes from a family of therapists and therefore had a knack for going straight for the tough questions like, for instance, ""tell me about your spirituality.""As I've said before, I don't often hike in close proximity to others, on account of my stopping to pick up trash and being socially awkward, but Spüüntula and I got along swimmingly. We discussed all kinds of skeleton-in-the-closet-y stuff and the kinds of things hikers never discuss, like politics, non-stop all morning. We caught up with Bubbles, Sprout, and Whiskers halfway through the day and I ended up hiking with Bubbles instead, who I quickly discovered I completely adore. She and Sprout are from Akron, OH and she reminded me quite a bit of one of my best friends from home, Brooke. She's candid and hilarious and always teasing someone. We passed a great couple of miles together as we dropped down a steep hill to a road crossing.And, wouldn't you know it, my favorite airstream, The Dented Bear Can, and my favorite Texans, Rain and Sprinkle, were parked at the gap. Not only were they there, quite a crowd had gathered, including Spüüntula, Sprout, Whiskers, Captain America and-miraculously-Ghost! I was offered a seat in the bed of the truck next to Sprinkle and Rain handed me a beer. Sprinkle told me she had heard from our mutual friend Nera, now sadly off trail. Rain informed me that he had met a three-sheets-to-the-wind Backbone atop Mt. Greylock and hiked with him a few miles. Always good to hear tidings of ghosts of hiking buddies past. After a few beers, we all decided to pile into the truck for a trip to the Chinese restaurant in Bennington. On the way, I noticed something in Captain America's hand and was momentarily confused.""Hey Cap, give me your wallet.""""Yeah, sure. Hey, this is the easiest mugging ever."" He responded, handing it over.""No look!"" I showed him my own wallet, the exact match of his.Now, under normal circumstances, this wouldn't be a remarkable moment, BUT, both Cap and I were carrying the same child's Ninja Turtle cloth wallet. We geeked out briefly, over the lap of a bewildered Spüüntula who was wedged between us, then took a picture once we reached the restaurant.After a delicious dinner and very fun conversation, we were overstuffed and back in the truck. We made a brief stop at the gas station and the boys emerged with a case of Budweiser-I'm sorry, I forgot it's called ""America"" now- to lug to the shelter.A few minutes later, we stood staring at the climb ahead of us with chagrin. I do not recommend climbing hundreds of vertical feet with a belly full of fried rice and a pack full of beer. It was only a mile or so, but it was a nauseating trek. I found Sin Nombre at the picnic table with a stodgy, grumpy looking NOBO who couldn't help but mutter ""holy shit"" as we wandered into camp. I guess he's not a people person and was less than thrilled by the arrival of-gasp!- FIVE people into camp.  I slipped behind the shelter to change into my camp clothes, joking with Sin Nombre that he was to stand guard. When I came back around the corner, he was standing with his arms crossed and back politely turned, playing the protective body guard flawlessly. I decided then and there that he was going to be my new best friend. I settled in at the picnic table, was offered a beer by Sprout, and watched with amusement-turned-horror as the grumpy NOBO beat a mouse to death with a water bottle and flung his tiny corpse into the woods. The mouse got the last laugh, though, because that resilient sucker wasn't actually dead and crawled right back to the shelter where he harassed his attacker for much of the night. The next morning, I was the first one up. The stodgy NOBO was no longer in the shelter, to my immense relief.Another NOBO began cooking breakfast alongside me and noticed a line of paracord hanging in the shelter. ""Oh shit, is that [name redacted to protect the guilty]'s bear line? Did he leave already.""I don't know, I think so. He wasn't here when I got up."" I responded.""I'll just take it with me, hopefully I'll catch up to him today."" I thought that was rather nice of him, considering his buddy was a violent, water bottle yielding, attempted mouse murderer, and as such, bid him farewell and good luck.Not ten minutes later, after the rest of the crew had emerged from their respective tents and began cooking breakfast, the mouse killer walked up to the table. I was surprised to see him, given that I'd presumed him to have slept in the shelter and left early. As it turns out, the mouse he'd tried to kill the night before had tormented him so relentlessly all night (well deserved, I would've done the same if I was that mouse) that he had set up his tent in the middle of the night.Before he could relate that story, though, he had something more important to discuss.""Where the [bleep] is my mother[bleeping] bear line???"" He screamed, spittle positively flying, in my general direction, presumably because I was the only person physically in the shelter. ""I, um, that guy took it-""""WHO? Who the [bleep] would steal my [bleep]ing bear line?"" He roared.""That guy, your friend, the other NOBO-""""WHAT other NOBO? Why the [bleepity bleep bleep bleep]""It went on like this for a few minutes longer, I too under caffeinated and overwhelmed to remember his buddy's name, until Sin Nombre figured out who I was talking about and intervened. Eventually, our crotchety asshole settled down enough to cook his breakfast and even apologize to Bubbles for traumatizing her with the previous night's mouse hunt, but it did cast a bit of a pall over the proceedings. Okay, sidebar, editor's note, whatever: looking back at this story months later, it's even more absurd than I remembered. You know what a bear line is? It's paracord. Paracord, people. It costs maybe $3 for forty feet of it. Plus, our friend here was using it as a clothesline. As in, he wasn't even hanging his food in a damn tree with it. His food was in his tent. Even if someone HAD stolen his paracord, big damn deal. Also, don't yell at me before coffee.Also, you may be wondering why I decided not to use our friend's trail name. I mean, I just told you I hated Sin Nombre when I met him and I freaking love that guy now. Well, our grumpy, assholey NOBO happens to be a pretty popular trail journal-er. Hope you find this post, buddy, but I won't out you as an asshole to your fans. Anyway, back to the story. Sin Nombre left the shelter first, as he has every morning since. Spüüntula followed. Eventually, it was just Bubbles, Sprout, Whiskers and I killing time and drinking coffee. To our surprise, two weekenders who had been camped down by the water source then emerged, carrying with them an enormous pack of bacon and a very tiny dog, some sort of teacup something or other. We watched greedily as they cooked over the fire until they finally offered to share. Is there anything better than bacon in the woods? No, no there is not.Later that day, I encountered Spüüntula and Sin Nombre at a shelter. We continued up towards the summit of Glastenbury Mountain together, our first summit with expansive views in Vermont. Cap decided it wasn't worth the effort to climb the tower, Sin Nombre took in the view and continued on because he's psychologically incapable of taking two breaks too close together, and Spüüntula and I were left to climb the tower together. It took a bit of negotiating to get Spüüntula up the tower, due to a healthy fear of heights, but the 360 degree views were more than worth it. I was quite proud of him. After lunch in the tower, we carried on together, reaching Kid Gore shelter fairly early. Sin Nombre left a note that he decided to carry on because the bugs were bad and there were no tent sites and Spüüntula and I decided to follow. We hiked through beautiful golden hour light, Spüüntula helping me to collect trash, including an oversized sterno stove, as we went. We made it to Story Spring shelter just before dark, where Sin Nombre was talking with a lovely section hiker named Becky, who was solo hiking in her 70s and wearing a Black Lives Matter pin on her lapel. I was immediately enamored by her, especially when she gifted me a BLM pin of my own. The next morning, I took my sweet time getting packed up, as we had all planned a short day to Stratton Pond, then a nearo into Manchester Center the next day.First, we had to tackle the first real mountain in Vermont, also called Stratton, where Benton McKaye was inspired to create the AT. I was hiking alone-okay, well, I was dancing and singing along to my music- when I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye. I quickly realized it was just another hiker and, in an effort to maintain my own dignity, stepped off the trail to let him pass and asked if he was Thru-hiking. It was obvious he was, based on his blistering pace, cuben pack, and disgusting beard.""Yep. And in September I'm hiking the Long Trail and next spring I'm hiking the PCT."" He responded without even slowing down. ""Okay?"" I said to his back as he took off down the trail. ""What a weird dude."" I thought to myself, before carrying on.A few miles later, I found Spüüntula and Sin Nombre atop Stratton mountain. They were seated on a bench in front of the caretaker's cottage eating donuts. The caretaker promptly offered me one as well and we sat together for a while before meandering over to the fire tower. It was Father's Day, so I took advantage of the mountain top phone service to call Papa Dale and waited for the day hikers and yoga tourists (from the yoga festival happening in the valley) to clear out. As we waited, the weird thruhiker from that morning appeared on the summit with his dad. Shortly after, a freakishly tall, skinny thruhiker with a gross mustache arrived and began taking awkward selfies with the AT map hanging on the tower. ""What a weird dude."" I thought to myself.Spüüntula, Sin Nombre, and I settled down to eat lunch and were quickly embroiled in a heated debate about Honeybuns. I think they're gross, Sin Nombre loves them, and Spüüntula didn't know what they were. Disgusting beard and gross mustache weighed in as well, firmly on the pro-Honeybun team. I learned their names were Jax and Packs, respectively, and it was definitely just a weird coincidence that their names rhymed because they didn't know each other. As we left the summit, Jax asked if he could hike with us because he hadn't talked to anyone in three weeks. He then began chattering at a mind boggling speed and hiking much faster than I had any inclination, so Spüüntula and I dropped back and left Sin Nombre to chase the little dude through the woods.We found them again at Stratton Pond and decided to camp together. Packs and a young Long Trail-er named Hangman also joined us. As we posed for a picture in front of the pond, a huge horsefly landed on Spüüntula's face. Without thinking and without warning Spüüntula, I reached out and smacked it off his forehead. As you might imagine, the resulting photo is incredible. As a weird twist, the only flowing water in the vicinity was filled with spawning fish. Spüüntula and I stared bewildered at the thousands of tiny fish until Packs called down to us to see what was taking so long. We asked him to weigh in on the drinkability of said water, so he began to cut through the brush down to the creek. ""Hang on, I just need to collect all the ticks in this area first."" He shouted down.After a long discussion, we decided to just drink the pond water instead, which tasted like moose pee and moldy feet even after being filtered. Everyone collected their water then we jumped in to the refreshing cloudy green water. Jax admitted that he hadn't showered in over a month. ""In other news, authorities are reporting a mass fish kill in Stratton Pond. Cause unknown."" Sin Nombre joked.Packs built a fire, everyone hung their soggy underwear from the trees, and we settled in to cook dinner. Bubbles, Sprout, and Whiskers arrived, having seen my note in a previous shelter log about our whereabouts. Everyone was headed in to town the next day and was therefore feeling quite cheerful. There was a lot of raucous laughter and no stodgy NOBOs around to say boo. We watched a full moon rise over the pond and Stratton Mountain before heading to bed. We rose early to catch sunrise and drink coffee. As an avowed not-morning person, I again took my time packing up. Bubbles shared my sentiments, so much so that she skipped sunrise entirely. I hiked the first part of the day with Spüüntula, then got ahead of him about five miles before the road into Manchester Center, so I hitched into town alone. The first car I saw stopped for me. I told the driver that I loved her state, which led to a discussion about my own hometown. Turns out she had just returned from a visit to the Cincinnati area and was, let's just say, less than enamored by my home. Fair enough.She dropped me at the grocery store, where I found Sin Nombre, Packs, and Jax sitting on the ground. Hiker trash...The four of us had snagged all the spots at The Green Mountain House Hostel outside of town but had some time to kill before our pick up time. We were soon joined by the rest of the crew from our campsite and a fewer other hikers. In normal towns, regular people oppose the conglomeration of ten dirty (or, in Jax's case, really, really, really dirty) hikers in a single public place. But this is Vermont and, despite it being a fancy tourist town, everyone was freakishly nice to us. Packs and I bonded over a shared trip to the liquor store, then Jax accompanied me to the outfitters for new boots. These two weirdos were starting to grow on me. Next post: our night in Manchester Center, Hike Naked Day, and the rest of Vermont.Maybe, if I ever write it.","North Adams, MA
