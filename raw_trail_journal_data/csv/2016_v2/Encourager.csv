Encourager,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521263,"Well, today I started my hike. It was cold with a heavy morning fog that froze on the trees and bushes to create a winter wonderland. It cleared up to be a beautiful day! I started at 7:22 AM and got to Dick's Creek on U.S. 76 at 2:45 PM. I hiked too fast for a first was careless and had one bad fall. Timothy picked me up and took me back to my vehicle at Unicoi Gap.On February 18th I will hike from Neel Gap to Unicoi Gap and then spend the night at home in my own bed. I will do sections around my home in Hiawassee until I start full time on February 28 at Springer. Then I will hike from Springer to Neel Gap and go home. On the 29th I will go back to Dick's Creek and hike north where I hope to get picked up at Winding Stair Gap and so on. As long as I can get rides home, for the first 100-200 miles, I plan on sleeping in my own bed whenever possible! Throughout March, I will trek North and go as far as I can and stay on the trail, unless the we have a blizzard, until I have to take off the 1st 12 days of April.","Unicoi Gap

It uses your hiking poles for poles and is suppose to be easy to set-up. I watched a youtube video on set-up and it seemed simple and straight forward. However, I was setting it up in my yard and have deep mulch there and the steaks wouldn't hold. I also had to tie some new cord and am having to order some tent stake tensioners. It will be much easier the next time. I am doing my section hikes with a full pack of about 30-35lbs including water. That is what I expect to carry on the trail.","

Encourager,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521416,"Today I completed 15 miles from Tesnatee Gap on the Richard B. Russell Hwy (hwy 348) to Unicoi Gap. I got my son Michael to drop me off. I am still testing gear, shoes, etc and hiked with a full pack. I am a fast hiker. I started at 8:00 AM and finished at 1:35 at Unicoi where I tried my first attempt at hitchhiking. I always pick up A.T. hikers. A.T. hikers are a familiar sight in our area and I didn't expect to have a problem getting a hike into Hiawassee. However, after 45 minutes of no success, I called my mother-in-law, Joan for a pick-up and she was there within a few minutes, Thanks Joan! You are the greatest person in the whole world! Since hitchhiking is often necessary on the A.T., I hope this isn't a bad omen for the future. However, no worry, God is in control, and being a Christ Follower, I put place my life in His hands and submit myself fully to whatever plans He has for me.I learned today that my hiking poles are shot and my Asics trail runners are too narrow. To me, shoes are the most important gear for long distance hiking followed by poles, and choice of pack, shelter and sleeping bag. It's all about a balance between comfort, weight and cost, but with footwear there is no room for compromise. It's simple: bad or poorly fitting shoes and you can't hike. Blisters and/or other foot problems will quickly end your hike. This fact was experienced during our last summers 550 mile Camino de Santiago.Today was beautiful, but the trail was icy in much of the rocky areas which required walking across long stretches stepping on the sharp tops of rocks above the ice and snow to avoid the treacherous, slick, frozen and ice covered rocks and roots. I was careful, and suffered no falls! Thank God.I was able to spend a lot of time in prayer for my fellow hikers, friends, family and church. It is only 9 days before I start full-time at Springer to complete the Georgia section of my hike!","Tesnatee Gap

Encourager,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522291,"Starting Sunday at noon at Springer, I hiked 9.1 miles, Monday 16.2 and Tuesday 13.8 miles. I am taking a couple of ""Zero Days,"" days that you don't hike, in order to do a lot of small things before I am too far from home, like taxes! I have a new great hiking partner, Kelly (Gazelle), whom I named and an excitement because I am actually doing it! Now, on Friday, I will leave Georgia behind and hope to get to the Smokies in a week. There we are expecting a lot of snow. I will post whenever possible. Please pray for me and a hiker called ""Shrink"" for his knees to heal.","Springer Mt

Encourager,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523155,"I started on Feb 28th at Springer and hiked to NOC, 137.3 miles in 5 days and got off the trail. I was doing this as a mission trip having been called to help and reach out to someone. I was prepared to do a thru hike if need be. However, I am at peace that I was able to be there for the one for whom I was called. I am at peace that I was faithful to this calling. Now I am going back to being a Trail Angel and will be with my wife Linda at Unicoi Gap this Saturday providing trail magic. Thanks for all the prayers!","Maine!
