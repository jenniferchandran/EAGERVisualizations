fonz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533017,"One week ago I decided to leave my home in Salt Lake City. Within hours I had uprooted everything I had known for the past few years. Only In search of finding a better solution to my problems. After too much thinking, a lot of heart break and a Rocky few months the only fitting solution was to embark on a new adventure. In a matter of weeks I will be starting my longest journey, setting a 1500 Mile goal for my self on the appalatian trail. With this comes a lot of meal planning,route planning, running, lifting and eating and eating and eating and even eating some more. I have only hopes of a fresh start and a new outlook on life. Now knowing that finding a home is not needed but that finding myself and being healthy and happy will be the only thing to bring me back to the place I love with the people I love dearly. I will be posting on here periodically, with stories, letters and pictures from my preparation to hiking on the trail. I hope you all enjoy the journey",,Desicion ,"May 13, Fri",0
fonz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535262,"I'm currently traveling to Springer mountain Georgia. After weeks of meal prep, gear shopping, saying hello and goodbye to family and friends I'm finally in the car. I'm most excited for the unknown. While there is so much preparation and planning before the hike nothing will fully prepare me for what's ahead. My mom, dad and two sisters will be hiking up to the top of Springer mountain with me where I will begin my trek. I'm starting out with a base pack weight of 24 lbs without food and water and a full pack weight of about 40 pounds (this will change lost likely). I've decided to do drop shipments at hostiles and post offices along the way instead of buying the majority of food in town. I'm feeling good and healthy [shout out to Dr Rubin for fixing my back up!] The support I've received here in North Carolina and from my family in Salt lake city has been incredible. None of this feels possible with out every single one of you. I can't wait to get going. I'll try to post from every leg of the trail. And maybe I'll learn how to run the blog a little better.?? thanks for reading see yah soon !",,The ride,"May 27, Fri",0
fonz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535958,"Currently at a place in Neel's gap called mountain crossings, paid 18 bucks for a bunk and a shower. I'll tell you the shower was much needed. I pushed a 17.6 mile hike yesterday which was possible one of the hardest things I've ever done. While on mile fourteen about to stop and set up camp due too lack of water and exhaustion I ran across a sign. This sign explained that a best canister was need up untill July first. And me without a bear canister feet blistered, shoulders bruised pushed another 3.6 miles. That last 3.6 miles didn't feel real. The weight of my pack felt like it had doubled and the blisters on my feet felt like gallons. When I got to lances creek my stopping point setting up camp felt like a dream. I somehow made an egg burrito scarfed it down, threw my bear hang up and crawled into my tent. My whole body was throbbing. I didn't make it back out that night. The next morning was much better I had accomplished a good day and decided to push to mountain crossings about 8 miles away. The climb up blood mountain was tough. It had a 1300 foot climb and a 1000 foot downhill section right afterwords. I was rewarded at the top by a spectacular view and at the bottom by a few barbque sandwhichs. At that moment I had won the day. Hiking twelve tommorow. Missing my friends and a pretty little blonde girl, all my family too. So far this has been incredible. Met so many nice people.","The ride

fonz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540498,"Sorry for not posting everyone! It's been 32 days now and a lot has changed. I've met a lot of great people on the way, seen beautiful sunsets and sunrises and have experienced more than I thought the trail would ever provide. I'm still hiking with Curt aka ""songbird"" and Justin ""bearbane"". We've decided to do a YouTube channel together and start recording sessions of our talks about the trail. It will be a bit explicit so enjoy what you can, hopefully you all enjoy it. Humor on the trail is probably the number one rule, anything goes out here and anything can be said. Not only does that keep the spirits high, but we all get to let off steam and be 100 percent our selves, being real out here is the best gift the trail has given me. Hiking with these two guys has been a blast. If none of you know or have seen our pictures together, CURT who will be referred to as songbird most the time has just graduated law school and Justin ""bearbane"" is a central Florida farmer and stock trader and military veteran. Then there's me ""five mountain"" is my trail name designated to me by my two buddies. It came about after telling them we had an all day down hill hike and then crushing close to five mountain summits down in georgia. People still call me fonz too I guess that will never go away ??. Yesterday we arrived in Maine after a 18 hour drive from hotsprings North Carolina. We had finished the Smokey Mountain National Park and a bit further down the trail we decided to try and catch up with the southbound hikers in Maine and New Hampshire to spice the trip up a little bit. Tommorow were headed to Baxter national park and the following day will be summiting mount katadin. I'm super excited for this summit due to the technicality of the climb and the difficulty and danger of some of the spines we will be crossing. So far we've done 273 miles Northbound and we plan to pick up the pace to about 100 miles a week. The southern part of the trail was nice, (except for the heat) and had some of the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen. Hopefully Maine provides new stories and experiences. I have no plans but this trail now as my relationship with my friend from Salt Lake city has ended. In a way I feel as if I have the whole world in front of me and it's mine for the taking. Living out here in the woods, living day by day is so refreshing. There's so much to think about what's next and evaluate the days as well. Every day brings a new challenge a new smile and new perspective on something. The best thing I've learned so far is this life is for me by me and I'm the controller of my world. I've learned that happiness is a choice not a gift, and it only comes from within. It's so refreshing to be able to chase my dream every day and feel like I'm on a path to a better life. With every mile I feel more accomplished and maybe soon I will be one of the lucky few who ever get to finish the whole Appalachian trail. One part of this trip I want to focus more on is blogging and documenting what's happening along the trail, how I'm feeling, the challenges and rewards the trail provides. As for the first 273 miles I'm feeling as happy as ever. I wake up with the biggest smile on my face knowing I'm going to meet people and learn more about myself everyday through doing so. That's my favorite part about the trail is the people, whether our interactions are short or hours long I seem to be able to connect with people out here and people seem to connect with me and support Me in what I'm doing. It really is an awesome feeling. The challenges I've encountered are mainly physical, after the Smokies I felt pretty beat up and I knew I was starting to slow down in my pace. The rewards come every day though, my favorite was up on top of Max Patch. I got to witness the most beautiful sunset while walking on top of a grassy bald after 18 brutal miles. It actually brought me to tears on the top, to end a hike that way was incredible. I hope I can post some more from Maine!
