When In Roam,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/478398,"First entry- cementing my resolve to tackle the AT.The short story is that I am in my early 40's and by the time I start my walk both of my sons will be safely tucked away at college, doing what 19 and 21 yr olds should be doing. I am ridiculously proud of them. They are ridiculously supportive of me. I divorced in 2003 (left in 2000) and never remarried. On some level I always knew I was going to want to do these sorts of things (hike the AT, the PCT and spend 6 months at a time in Europe) and I knew my need for adventure was not conducive to settling down. It would have been nice to have had someone in my life more permanently, but it would not have been fair, or honest. Two things I value. You could say I have been planning this type of adventure since 2000. 14 years. It is time. I am waiting to start out until April 1st, 2016. Mainly because my youngest son won't head off to his dorm until late August 2015 and by then it's too late in the year to start. So I will wait till the following Spring. And secondly, because I try to find the humor in everything, and somehow starting on April Fools Day makes me giggle. I will be leaving my job of 5+ years, and the great benefits. Friends and coworkers. I have no plans to try to return to my job when I am done. The whole point of this is to completely shake up the life I've had to lead for the past 25 years and to figure out what life I WANT to lead. It's terrifying and exhilarating. It will be the smartest thing I've ever done for me- yet seemingly the most socially irresponsible. I find I am caring less and less about other people's opinions these days, I hope to continue the trend.The point of this journal is to have a place to get it all out of my head and to feel like I have some kind of sounding board. I don't share my plans to walk away from Life As I Know It with many people. I need to share it with someone. I have a friend that knows my plans, I call her Fallophadora, but she has no desire to involved in any way other than to support me. We go out once a month and eat, drink gallons of iced tea (we would drink alcohol, but I have an allergy and she sticks to tea out of solidarity) and discuss my latest crazy twist on my plans. She is 15 years younger than me, has her college education, a husband who adores her and a new house that they're turning into a home. She is still optimistic and believes I can and will do anything I decide to do. (Truth be told, I am so happy for her that she is happy, but I often find myself checking my true feelings about my need to expand on this life by gaging how tight my chest gets when I think about having a life- such a beautifully traditional one- just like hers. Usually, I go home and research hiking gear after these exercises.)I do have the support of my dad, but he lives in the south and I am in New England. We have limited conversations. I miss him dearly. I would love for him to walk part of the AT with me. He has said he used to think about walking the whole thing but his enthusiasm to do that has waned over the years. Perhaps he will rediscover some of it. So that's it. Now I am doing research, reading as many books as I can and walking 5-10 miles 3-4 times a week when this life allows it. So, hi! :-)

When In Roam,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/478404,"Several weeks ago I applied to be a volunteer with the Green Mountain Hiking Club out of Waterbury, VT. I am south of them in Randolph but knew the Long Trail and the AT run the length of my state (Vermont). I am excited to report that after some confusion on where my application went (got temporarily lost on the interwebs) I was accepted and given a few sections of the LT and the one from the AT from which to choose. I happily chose the AT section which was geographically closest to me (still about an hour away) that runs from Cloudland Road in Woodstock, VT to Thistle Hill in Pomfret, Vermont. By google maps it's roughly 6 miles, but that's road footage.   I am awaiting official paperwork. Next weekend (Thanksgiving weekend) I am planning to spend a day walking the length of my mini-section. I will be tasked with trail maintenance. It is my understanding that this section of the trail has not yet been adopted, so I will see what needs to be done and go from there. I also see it as a fantastic opportunity to dole out a little trail magic next year. I think I will find some type of comfort, too, in becoming familiar with a part of the AT before I can hike it. I also imagine it will be a good feeling to get to my ""home"" on the AT after all those months of hiking and will hopefully provided the needed umpfh! to finish the trail. I will post some updates and pictures after next weekend's hike.","Cloudland Road, Woodstock VT

When In Roam,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/478424,"I am obsessed. Well, at least slightly obsessed. I am still able to function in my daily life, but just barely. I spend my free time reading books on past hikes and the logistics of future hikes. I watch hours of youtube videos on hikes and gear reviews. Even when I am working, I have one half of my brain focusing on that while the other half sorts through the information I have heard, seen or read. I silently, internally, talk to my fears and expectations and hopes. I sort out my own guidelines for my own walk. I dream about backpacks and gear in pounds and ounces. I created a conditioning schedule, that despite a day or two off the wagon, I have managed to stick to. I have fallen sort of in love with the New Balance hiking shoes I treated myself to last month. The crappy tennies I was wearing were barely fit for daily wear, let alone conditioning for a long distance hike. $220 including tax and insoles. I've been a single parent for 14 years. I DON'T spend $220 on myself. Ever. It felt delicious. The dollars pile up in my head when I think about the gear I will need. My plan is to dilute the guilt over spending that amount of money with time and diligent research. The truth is, I won't need to feel guilty about that when I buy those things, I've just gotten really good at doing so. The boys will be off at college. Their stays include room and board (more food than even they can eat). My trekking poles and rain covers will not be competing with grocery money or the light bill. I have earned this. I have planned for it. I have begun to arrange my life to accommodate it. The time is now! Well, the time is 16 1/2 months from now, April 1st, 2016, but you get what I mean.The boys are so supportive. They think my trail name is cool. Neither of them have any desire whatsoever to join me on even the smallest stretch of the trail...lol... I am having to relearn everything. At first when they tell me they want no part of the trail, I feel sad, a little left behind by my grown sons. Then I am overwhelmed with relief. I love them more than life. But I am growing up, too. The trail is my thing. While I would absolutely share it with them if they were interested, a part of me is deliriously happy that they are not and I can pursue it in glorious, guilt free   solitude. I am having to realign my entire thought process. I never planned to raise 2 sons on my own. Who does? And I am not going to lie and say I haven't had days when I wished for the days when they were old enough to go off to college, allowing me a chance to stop and think, to figure out what I wanted to do next. But the reality of it snuck up on me. All of a sudden I was dropping Fernando off at his dorm. AND DRIVING AWAY. Now, my youngest, Buddha, is in his Senior year of high school. We are talking about colleges and SAT's. He is practically frothing at the mouth to go be with his brother at college. I am only 42. Healthy. Single. I have at least 40 years ahead of me. (blink, blink. Gulp.)There was one day in particular when it hit me. Suddenly I was sobbing-lonely for their childhoods. Snuggles on laps and pudgy hands holding mine. We were a team, just the three of us for so long. What the hell do I do now? I thought? I plummeted into a pretty dark place.I have never been one to stay down long. Within the month, I found that I had started dreaming again- narrowing in on the things that got my heart pumping. The trail. 6 months in Europe. Maybe going back to college and finishing my degree in something completely unmarketable for the sole purpose that I enjoy it, rather than the hope that it would put me in a better position to buy more groceries and pay a light bill for a bigger place. I will have 6 1/2 months between Buddha's departure for college and my start of the trail. I have a job that allows me to work from literally anywhere that I can plug into hardwired internet. I have a friend in England who has said- Come stay with me for a bit! I think I may do that and while I'm there, find a short term rental and work from England for those 6 mos. The time difference is only 5 hours. Instead of 8am-4:30pm I would work from 1pm-9:30pm. It could happen. My weekends would be a heck of a lot more exciting that's for certain!So now, I think about everything that I have to do between now and Trail Time. Get my passport. Get Buddha to college. Store literally everything I own. Go visit my friend in Northern England and then find a rental. Work for 6 months in a foreign country. Eventually quit my job, come back to the states, gear up and then hit the trail and then walk 2100 miles.It's a little overwhelming. But in a good way.Actually, it sounds amazing.My heart is thumping.  Dream big,","Randolph, Vermont
