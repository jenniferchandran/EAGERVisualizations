One Year Later: Oh, what a sad day this is. I miss the Trail. I feel like it was years ago instead of just one year. I remember thinking the first day on the Trail was so easy! I could not imagine that it would become hard. The best part of the day was meeting Ken. I saw Ken and his wife Kim after I summited Springer and headed North, they were heading up Springer. A few hours later, Ken came to a shelter where I was taking a break. He said hello and moved on. A while later I caught up with him. As we began sharing about our lives, Ken said, "" I am a Christian."" I remember thinking, ""Thank you, God for having both of us start the Trail the same day."" Ken and I hiked together for 300 miles and 30 days until his back would not let him hike further. He is the first of my new ""Friends for Life.""","Dahlonega Georgia!

One Year Later: Southpaw joined us this morning. He said he hiked too fast the first day, so we would slow him down! Sometime during the day, Ken hatched the idea to go to his wife's cabin for the night. We jumped at the chance. Hiking thru snow flurries for the last mile, we arrived at Gooch Gap where Trail Magic was set up, but they did not offer us any.  Then Kim showed up with Pizza! Ha Ha.

We hiked 15 miles to Neels Gap where there's a great Outfitter store. Ken re-outfitted; a new backpack, water system, hiking poles and insoles. Ken & Kim's cabin is about 1/4 mile from the gap. I feel very fortunate to be able to spend another night here!

 
I ran into Pretzel at Neels Gap, he stayed at our home in 2012!
One Year Later: Blood Mountain was the first real challenge, even with a slack pack. The views from the summit were great. We arrived at Neel's Gap at 6 PM and Kim took us back to the cabin for a spaghetti supper. I was so blessed to hike with Ken and Southpaw.","Gooch Gap

One Year Later: At the Walasi-Yi Outfitters, I purchased a new sleeping bag from Pretzel. I gave up the borrowed Man's 20 degree bag which was heavier and bulkier. Ken bought a new pack, lightening his load by a few pounds, also with a better fit for additional comfort. We said goodbye to Kim for now. The campsite was beautiful at Low Gap, as we camped beside a stream. I was happy with my first double digit day with a full pack. Since I had broken my ankle a year ago, I had been concerned that the ankle would not hold up, especially since Signage had to go home for that reason. The ankle was never a problem.","Neels Gap

Today we stopped at Blue Mountain Shelter at 1:30 but we may hike on to Hiawasee as there is rain in the forecast.More info from previous days: I met Southpaw and Ken five miles into my hike on the first day. Ken and Kim are from Michigan. Southpaw is from Indiana and is 66 years old. Kim rented the cabin for 3 days to be used to help slack pack, very grateful for that!I've noticed that there are handicap bars installed on the privies and each has handicap access. I find this very odd, who would be up here in a wheelchair?

One Year Later: Our first Shelter! We did not continue to Hiawassee, but planned to hike the 1.5 miles, then go to town for a motel. Q-Tips was at the shelter and planned to hike to town for a 12 pack and bring it back. He was gone less than 2 hours. He got a hitch to town and back and hiked 3 miles in that short time. I continue to be amazed at what the younger crowd can do, because I certainly cannot keep up with them.","Low Gap

I checked, sure enough, hurried back while others guarded my backpack, disaster averted! We reached Unicoi Gap about 10:30 where a Christian Group was cooking hamburgers for hikers, called ""Minding the Gap"". I think it was the biggest hamburger I have EVER eaten! We sat there and relaxed for 2 1/2 hours while watching the other hikers (about 30) coming down the hill, moving left to right. We thought they looked like a pin ball machine! We caught a ride with Karate Kid and Joe into Hiawassee. Karate Kid will be a Triple Crowner by the end of the year!Even though I've done the needed chores, like laundry, it's been a nice relaxing day.My firsts: first Hotel, first Hitch, first AYCE Buffet (photo next page)Interesting fact about Southpaw: He thru-hiked the AT in 2008 even though he got lime disease during that time.

Our plan tomorrow is to hike to Dick's Creek Gap, 6.3 miles, take the 11:00 shuttle (if we are able to get there in time) back to Hiawassee, get a hotel and attend Sunday's sunrise service, and a regular church service later. So far, I have no blisters but I have treated a hot-spot. My shoes are high top Merrills. At Neel's Gap, I bought a new sleeping bag, the one I was using was borrowed. Pretzel works at the outfitter there and he sold it to me.Interesting story: on our first day hiking, we met a hiker, name unknown, his dog's name was Mo. The hiker had lost his pack cover. A couple of days later three hikers walked into camp and asked if we had lost a pack cover. Shortly after that, a Ridge Runner came in and I asked him if he could return it to the hiker we saw camped a little further south of us. Then today, seven days later, we learned that he did get it back, another example of Trail Magic!

One Year Later: I loved this day, because it was the day we met Limey. Funny that Southpaw helped him hang the bear bags. 4 months later, Limey tried to help some ladies in New York hang their bear bags and he couldn't get the bear line up. Then White Owl hung the line. Those ladies then housed Limey in Vermont, but never contacted White Owl. They must have been attracted to Limey's British accent! The last time I saw Limey was in Massachusettes, after seeing him in Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, New York, Connecticut and Massachusettes, half of the 14 states and over 1400 miles.

We hitched a ride back to Hiawassee, thanks to the use of my thumb. The plan is to stay here tomorrow. I'm unable to call the church to get a ride where I'd like to attend the sunrise service, so I'll try to catch a ride early in the morning, half an hour before church should be starting.When I reach Franklin, I'll be staying with a friend from High School whom I haven't seen in 40 years! The guys will be staying with a thru-hiker that I met in Waynesboro at the Post Office in 2008, trail name, Hometown.Much to my dismay, I found out that Logan's friend that is hiking, left two days after I did and he's already passed me! I was looking forward to seeing him. I have heard that there have been several injuries on the trail already from hikers trying to go too fast. Please slow down and enjoy the trail and the people you meet!
One Year Later: And I thought Georgia was difficult! Sometimes it seems that I was a different person back then. Georgia was a walk in the park compared to the Whites and Maine! Even though I considered the hiking tough, quitting was never an option, nor did I even think about that possibility. I was having too much fun!","Sassafras Gap

We then arranged for a ride back as soon as we got there so we were able to enjoy the service without worrying about getting back to the motel. After the service we went to an all you can eat breakfast which was wonderful and walked to the 10:15am church service.We are now relaxing for the rest of the day and will get a good, well rested start in the morning.A mouse chewed my bite valve at the Blue Mtn Shelter.

We covered 4 miles in less than 2 hrs. Then we came to the base of Albert Mountain, the first serious rock climb. It took scrambling, climbing, using the knee for approx 1/2 mile. The angle was very steep upward. At the top was our first Fire Tower, which is mile 100. We had a nice easy afternoon to the next shelter. However, it's now 4:30 and there was no place in the shelter AND no place to camp on the hillside! We felt we had no choice but to push on. The next 2 miles were on the side of a hill. The next possible camp spot that we came to was at Wallace Gap but we didn't want to camp near traffic on a road, so we pushed up the next mountain and found a campsite about 6:00pm. After a quick supper and camp set up we were bedded down about 7:00pm.

I could hear Southpaw having a rough time with the wind in his hammock but I fell back asleep. I woke up about 5:30am. One of Southpaw's anchors for the shelter over the hammock had blown away. He quickly packed up and hiked out. I fell back to sleep, woke up about 7:00am and realized we need to pack up and get out of there quickly, chose not to eat breakfast. We had some uphill but mostly down hill with the wind still blowing hard. We arrived at Winding Stair Gap at 8:30 to find Southpaw waiting for us. He was shocked to see us so early because we usually start hiking about 9:00am. 
I called my friend Russell in Franklin and his wife picked us up, took us to a wonderful breakfast at Sunset Diner. We were able to do all of our town chores, laundry, shopping, outfitter needs at the 076 Outfitter and a late lunch at another great diner.  Then Hometown, an '08 hiker and his wife Susan came over and for the next several hours, we shared hiking stories. Finally, I was able to contact my son's friend Spicer who also arrived in Franklin today. I found out that a prankster alluded that he passed me last week.

Breakfast consisted of pancakes, bacon and numerous toppings, including syrups, apple butter and pumpkin butter and such. We had a great time and got to see Spicy again. The breakfast at the church has been going on since 2008. I saw many names I knew on the 2008 poster including Babu, Bad Wheels, Hot Tang, Earthbound and Harvest, who we will see shortly. After breakfast, my friends Russell and Rebeka took us back to Winding Stair Gap. The day started out foggy with two medium climbs. We saw our first bald, which was Siler Bald, then we saw Wayah Bald with a stone tower and beautiful views. We could see Standing Indian in the distance.

Then, less than a half mile later, we came to Burningtown Gap where 1st Baptist Church had trail magic! HOT coffee, biscuits, gravy, Sausage! Juice, Yogurt, Fruit And snacks to carry out. We love these people!  The next waypoint was Wesser Bald with an observation tower and a grand 360 view.  We then started thinking we could hike in to the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center) for the night. However, it was not to be. Southpaw began having knee issues, then I fell. I only slightly scraped one knee. It is not easy to wiggle out of a pack. Once I was free, I decided to take a short break while I was down. However, some day hikers came by and helped me up. They also gave word to the guys who were ahead. So we ended up camping at Rufus Morgan shelter.

Ken walked over and asked the guy for a ride and the answer was yes! We were shuttled right to the door of First Baptist Church of Bryson City. We were warmly welcomed by Frank who took us to the fellowship hall for breakfast and more COFFEE. What a wonderful church! They provided a ride to a great little motel and a promise of a ride back to NOC tomorrow. Now we are enjoying a nice restful day. The couple next door was fascinated by our journey and asked many questions. We walked to the Pizza Hut, re-supplied at the grocery store and secured a ride back to the motel. It is easier to get a ride when you can ask directly and explain why you need a ride.

We hiked out of NOC, 7 miles up, the longest up we have faced so far. We were passed by more hikers than any other day. We planned to stop at the first shelter, but were warned of nuro virus there. Sure enough, there was a white flag of warning on the shelter sign so we hustled on.
 Cheoah Bald was beautiful! To the east we could see where we had been. Walking to the other side, we could see Fontana Lake. We continued to Locust Cove Gap in need of water. The close campsites were full, but we found a nice secluded flat spot and settled down by 7:00 pm.

That's the time you need energy to start your day, and fuel your body throughout the day. We got an early start. After 4 miles we came to Jacobs Ladder, 700 foot climb in .6 miles, very steep, straight up with 10 foot switch back and forth. Of course, in my mind, I was singing ""we are climbing Jacob's ladder!"" After a few more ups & downs, we arrived at Cable Gap Shelter about 4 PM 159.2 miles. The shelter is a tiny log structure, supposed to sleep six but it's really only enough for four people!
We camped by a stream, I had a nice flat spot and didn't slide all around in my tent this time. I slept better than the last hotel! Of course, when you're in a tent for 10 hours you hope to get at least eight hours, when you figure in all the bathroom breaks. Most of us go to bed at sundown, usually in the tent by 7:00PM and up by 7:00AM.
Last night, supper was the last of my dehydrated meal from Harmon House: lentils, peas and cabbage, quite good. I had a wonderful side of instant mashed potatoes from the hiker box. For those of you who don't know what a hiker box is, it's a box at a shelter, hotel lobby or other lodging places where hikers frequent. Hikers can give to the box when they want to lighten their load or have too much of an item and they can take from the box whatever they need.

We caught the shuttle to Fontana Village and resupplied, ate at the grill, a huge lunch!
We walked to the lodge to print out our great Smoky Mountain National Park passes. This is a labor intensive process, 15–20 minutes. Then sent thru email to print out. Southpaw couldn't remember his password so we are waiting around to try to get that resolved. 
We planned to hike to the Fontana Hilton. However, when the shuttle reached the trail head, Limey was waiting to go to the lodge. He offered to share his room at the Lodge!

I went to the Grand Prix Motel to get a room but no one was there. I went to Motel 6 next door. They had a room but it would not be ready for three hours. I asked a woman who happened to be there what to do. She said she could get the maid at the Grand Prix to give me a room, since the owner was at Church. So I got my room. When I tried to take a shower, the faucet fell off! So I took a bath. Realizing that I needed change to do laundry, I went to a nearby gas station.

I saw a hiker there by the name of Sweets. She was bent over and I knew exactly what her problem was! We asked if we could help. She asked if we had any Gatorade. We didn't, but I gladly gave her an energy packet. I also gave her some sugary items knowing that that his would help make the recovery quicker. When we saw her later at suppertime, she said she was feeling much better.
Another mile we were at Charlie's Bunion. Today's hiking had such icy, treacherous conditions, some snow and mushy trails which can really slow you down. 
After another 6 miles, we were at Pecks Corner which is .4 miles off the trail. Hikers do not enjoy hiking almost another half mile just to get to the shelter off the AT. Luckily, all of us were in the shelter because through the night it rained!

IWOX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527901,"It rained most of the night. We got up and hiked in the rain all day! It was very poor trail conditions; rain running off of the trail, no blue sky, foggy. It was an uneventful day, except mileage made. 
We hiked 5 miles to Tri-Corner Shelter by noon. Several hikers were there, trying to decide whether to go on. We could have gotten high, a lot of smoking going on! They hardly talked to us. We quickly ate lunch and moved on and laughed about it.At Cosby Knob Shelter two men put up their tent, then took it down at least 3 times as the weather changed from rain to no rain. One hiker could not get his water pump to work even trying for over an hour.
When we arrived at the Shelter, there was Trailrunner, TwinkleToes! I got the MOST scrutiny of any permit EVER issued!  Let me explain: I met TwinkleToes in 2008 at Kincora while hiking with Racoon on his Thru-hike. She had an eye infection, like pinkeye. Lipstick (my transcriber) and I took her to a clinic in Damascus, VA. The following photo was taken in 2008 on the way to Damascus, notice the cloth over Twinkletoe's eye?

The shelter was full, but Ken gave me his space and he tented. Cosby is a fun shelter because Phyllis and I were entertained by a comedy show there in 2011. The Boy Scouts had also hiked in at the end of their jaunt and gave us a 1 pound bag of trail mix, which we gladly accepted!

IWOX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527976,"Ken left early and hiked fast to get spots at Standing Bear Shelter. Southpaw couldn't keep up, he had a heel problem.
When we got to Davenport Gap, there was Tugboat. He comes weekly to do a tree report and brings Trail Magic. I had elected to not eat lunch, to get a candy bar and soda, which I was craving. There was Tug Boat! He had Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew, candy and potato chips. When Southpaw arrived, I got him treats. He called a friend to come and get him at Standing Bear so he could go to a clinic and see a doctor.  When I moved out for the last mile, 6 hikers were at the bottom of the hill, they rushed to the right to see an Elk that was down there. I crossed the bridge and here came the elk back! It was coming back across behind Tug Boat in his truck. I used my zoom for the first time!
History of the elk: they were reintroduced to the area 15 years ago so they've been increasing in numbers. They acquired 2 bulls from that heard to strengthen, now there's 180. You see an orange tag in their ear. President Roosevelt led efforts to save the elk. If elk thrive in the Smokies, it will be the realization of the hopes of early conservationists. As Theodore Roosevelt wrote a century ago: “If the people only have foresight, they can, through the power of the State, keep the game in perpetuity … the stately and beautiful wapiti, can be kept on the public lands.”Someone shot one in the park near Tri-Corner Knob Shelter. It's a Federal offense to kill them and the guy is in jail for doing so!
I hiked into Standing Bear Hostel in another mile. Ken saved me a bunk (paid for). A Lady walked up looking for Southpaw. She decided to drive down to catch him at I40. We. heard later someone saw him being picked up. He's in Asheville now and has an appointment tomorrow on 4/14.

Limey keeps me laughing! He's from the South of London, but has been living in the states for many years. He's taking 3 days off to go to Asheville. I love his accent, and he says the greatest one-liners. When my mattress went flat, Limey was next to me and his had gone flat also. I asked him, so what does that tell you? He accused me of blaming him on putting a hole in mine! The next night my mattress was fine. Chances are no hole in it!
Today I was without Southpaw, and I missed him a lot! Ken is waiting at the first shelter at Groundhog Shelter, 7 miles. The plan is to meet at the next shelter.
When I reached the gap before Max Patch, Trail Magic of pizza & drinks was a welcome surprise! Ken was waiting there. That was our supper! We camped at a random spot after Max Patch. (They are hoping to hike 15 miles each day the next 2 days so they can make it to Hot Springs for their weekend Trailfest celebration.

Ken got there at 9:30 and I got there at 10:30. Trail Magic again, how lucky can we be? A wonderful breakfast of eggs, sausage, pastry and spinach salad. 
Zack showed up at 11:00. Ken suggested we meet at Deer Shelter, another 10 mi, which was going to be my biggest day because I had already hiked 5 miles.
Zachary and I hiked 2 major climbs, hard after 10 miles! When we arrived at the shelter, NO ONE was there!!! No Ken, did he make a wrong turn? Or did he choose to go a little further, 3 miles down to Hot Springs? I was worried most of the night about his whereabouts. BAD news is he didn't call his wife. I called Kim and planned to get up early to get to Hot Springs to make sure he was there.
The Trail book states water is .2mi to the west and the shelter is .2mi to the east. I went .2 mi to the shelter and then back to the trail to go west for the water source. The water was so difficult to get to! I needed to stand in the water to get to the spout! I took my shoes off, stepped in and my feet proceeded to freeze in the water! Maddening thing is, when I went back to the trail, and then .2 miles to the shelter, I noticed there's a water source on the way to the shelter = half a mile I didn't need to walk!!BREAKFAST!

Yes, we were able to get a room at the Alpine. It's been a wonderful day here in Hot Springs! We see many people we have met on the trail and enjoy catching up. However, the best of Trail Magic occurred. After many lazy hours, I went to the outfitters for denatured alcohol. While I was pouring alcohol outside, the couple next to me said their son hiked in 2007. ""What is his trail name?"" ""Waffle.""

""Waffle! I know Waffle!"" I tried to get ice cream to him at a shelter. He wasn't there but other hikers told him I was there. The next year at trail days he saw me and said, ""You owe me ice cream!"" 
I bought him ice cream In 2008, 2010, and I believe in 2012 also!

Waffle's parents and I talked for hours! Wonderful trail magic!
Rethinker is a 2008 thru-hiker. I came by his booth in Hot Springs and said, ""We have a mutual friend, Boy Floyd!"" He sent me your book 2 years ago. ""I love it!""

I played ""How Great Thou Art"" after the service. We arranged with Sarah ""Harvest"" AT 2008, to slack pack six miles. It was a long up, so we were glad for the slacking! We had beautiful views of Hot Springs and the French Broad river. Upon arriving at Tanyard gap, Zack immediately secured a ride back to his car in Hot Springs. He was back in 20 minutes, what took 3 hours to hike!  Harvest took us to her and her husband's home, Root Bottom Farm. What a great place! She and Morgan have transformed a junkyard into a working organic farm complete with a tiny house for visitors.  Dinner was delicious stew served in the ""party deck"".

IWOX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528844,"Jill called me mid day while they were on a break on a ridge-line that is supposed to be part of the hardest part of the trail:
We left Root Bottom Farm at 8:30. We took Sarah's car without Sarah and dropped it off at Tanyard Gap and hiked on. They will pick up their car later this week when they go to Hot Springs for their Anniversary. 
We hiked out of Tanyard Gap for 11-12 miles in great weather! We saw another hiker with the same problem I had last week and I gave him an energy pack.  Ken waited for us, he said there is a store up ahead called Mom's. It looked like it might be closed, it looked dilapidated, abandoned so we trudged on. Shortly after, a lady stopped by where the trail meets the road to the a hostel, the owner and said it was open. We were excited to have food, so excited that we stayed for an hour. This counted as our supper. I had a cheeseburger, Dr. Pepper, a V8, a Klondike Bar and a bottle of water. 
We had planned to stay at Little Laurel shelter, but it was 4 more miles. After hiking another mile, we decided to camp. Beast and Longstride were camping back near Mom's. 

When we got to camp, Ken decided to get off the trail, his back is really bothering him. He turned around to go back to the hostel and wait for Kim. 
Southpaw has plantar fasciitis. Kim explained: Good news/Bad news, meaning the ligament connecting the front of the foot to the heel is over used and over stretched and develops minute tears. Repeated use of the damaged ligament results in inflammation and fasciitis...a sharp, stabbing pain on the bottom of the foot near the heal. Commonly known as 'runner's heel.' That's the bad news. The good news is it is treatable and the doctor prescribed a special shoe insert with a a hole where the ligament attaches and additional cushion support surrounding that area. He thinks he will be able to finish the hike. Chicken Feet has been with us for 3 days. We were in bed by 6:00. Kim will be picking us up to take us to Uncle Johnnies in Erwin. 
The Ridge trail is absolutely glorious and the pictures will show how beautiful it is.

We were disappointed, NO trail magic! We hiked on to the next road hoping that maybe the free food would be there. No such luck! However, there is a hostel called Hiker Paradise 1/2 miles to the west. After much deliberation, we decided to go to the hostel. The walk seemed longer than half a mile. The hostel is only 4 walls but is a gem in progress. Jerry, who runs the hostel, is working very hard and is a very nice guy. There are 9 bunks, has been full every night for a couple of weeks. Last night he even set up a big tent and rented it out. There's a beautiful stream in the yard. I highly recommend Paradise Hostel. It's very nice, lots of food, pizza etc. There are showers, but you can't shower while laundry is going. This is a very depressed area, this is the only business in this zip code and no cell service.
At one point I tried to borrow a bicycle from a boy to try and get cell service, but it had 2 flat tires. So, he offered me his scooter. I scooted for about half a mile, I still only had spotty service. I tried calling Cathy, my transcriber. She was at the Hospital with her family, excited to let me know that she is now a Grandmother!

Cathy comment: I called Tim to ask the Firm's name where Jill used to work. We had a great conversation. If you enjoy Jill's fun personality, you should meet Tim, he completes their team of wit and humor, great man! He shared a funny story about Jill. I have permission to share! ""One of the Best memories of the White House is when our neighbor came to save Jill. We were both working in the backyard and Jill said she needed to go to the bathroom. When she started towards the house, I tackled her. She started screaming! The neighbors across the street, Rob and his large wife Robbie, thought someone was being attacked. Robbie arrived with a bat in hand, ready to go into action! All four of us had a great laugh!""

He's doing fine but he also shared that there is one heartbroken dog laying around, their Corgi, Zobbie (black, with a white blaze, looks like she's wearing a tuxedo). Tim takes her for a ride EVERY day in the car to keep her happy.

So, where we stayed is not even in the guidebook. We learned that Chicken Feet stayed here. Jeff was hiking great, even on the up-hills. He is a stone mason, so he is very strong, he was just using different muscles.
We met up with Monica from Quebec, out on her second day of a two month section. At 8 miles, we arrived at Jeff's car. He was not ready to quit yet, so he unloaded his pack and took half my stuff. He then hiked 3 more miles before turning back. I enjoyed the partial slack packing!
 Southpaw waited for me at Greasy Creek Gap to decide whether to go on or go to the ""friendly"" (they say they are not hostel), I tried to find Chicken Feet. All I could hear on the phone was 367.2. The guidebook showed water and camping there, so we decided to hike the .8 miles. We also convinced Monica to go too. After a while we suspected that we were way past .8 but no sign of water or camping or Chicken Feet. Shortly, we arrived at Clyde Smith Shelter: 2 miles!! We realized that Chicken Feet gave us the mileage from the 2015 book and he was back at the ""friendly"".

The section I was hiking I had hiked with my scribe Cathy ""Lipstick"" and her husband ""Racoon"" in 2008. It was fun to recognize some of the places. At Hughes Gap there was Trail Magic by Rob Bird. I enjoyed talking to Rob. He ran a hostel in Massachusetts that my daughter may have stayed in 2008. We decided to cut the mileage to stay with Monica at Roan High Knob Shelter, where I had stayed in 2008, but that year we hiked southbound. Switchbacks have been added to make the trail about 2 miles longer, but much easier!
Something odd happened today while hiking. I thought it started raining, it sounded like rain but when I stopped and held out my arm, the rain sound stopped and my arm was not getting wet. I started again and I heard drops again! This happened several times, when I stopped, no rain. I finally realized that there were thousands of grasshoppers around me! When I moved, they jumped, when I stopped, they stopped, ha! 
When I caught up to Monica, she asked me what the name of the little blue flowers was. I remember them as ForgetMeNots. Monica said that would be her trail name, because she liked the flower and it would remind her not to forget her water bottle. 
We met many south-bounders out for day hikes and since we weren't in a hurry, we enjoyed talking to all of them. I came up with the idea of sending a message back to Chicken Feet that we would be at the next shelter. Then I asked about ten hikers to greet Chicken Feet by name when they saw him. I was disappointed that he did not come in to the shelter, so I don't know how or if my trail fun worked. 
We arrived at the shelter early and settled in, then at 7:00pm we were hit by a horrendous thunderstorm. It only lasted 45 minutes, but it was rough. I was told there was more rain overnight but I slept thru it.

Unfortunately, Bigbird twisted his ankle and/or his knee a little bit, so I stayed with him until we reached The Mountain Harbour Bed and Breakfast where he had a reservation. We had about 3 hours before John and Ann would arrive, so we hitch hiked to the town of Roan Mountain for a BBQ Supper. Southpaw got the hiker special which consisted of a double cheeseburger with pulled pork and French fries right on the sandwich. He also got a side of sweet potato fries and ice cream for dessert. He could not eat it all! I got the BBQ platter and estimated it to be a half pound of pork BBQ with coleslaw and beans. ForgetMeNot got a chicken burrito. We then resupplied and hitchhiked back to the B&B. Interesting fact about Monica(ForgetMeNot): this is her very first time staying in an American home (remember she is from Quebec, Canada).
We enjoyed a great evening of fellowship with John and Ann!

We arrived at the trailhead at 11:00am for a late start. John was immediately asked for a ride, so he agreed to take the hiker on to Roan Mountain . Thanks John!!
We hit the trail. It was an enjoyable hike with no hard climbs, through fields, around a cemetery and a church, with beautiful views all around. There is even a bench situated at a beautiful view, as noted in our trail guide. Jones Falls was a nice place for a break. Mountaineer Shelter was our lunch break at 3:00pm. 
At 5:00pm, still a ways from our destination, it hit me: I was HUNGRY, in spite of having eaten 2 hours earlier. I grabbed a snack and hurried on. My first experience with Hiker Hunger! 
Our destination was Vango Hostel. ForgetMeNot waited to show me the blue blazed trail to the Hostel. I know I would have missed it because it was very hard to find. Thanks, ForgetMeNot!!
We had the nicest time at Vango! We set up in the bunkhouse for $5! It was small, but had all the space we needed. ForgetMeNot tented to try her tent in the rain and she stayed dry. 
The evening ended with me being able to play the piano outside on the deck!! Scottie, the hostel owner, had some music I could play and we had a lot of fun.

We hiked out of Vango Hostel with our goal being the famous Kincora Hostel. It was again, such a beautiful hike thru rhododendrons and water falls, very easy. We arrived at Kincora at 3:30. We sat around and talked with other hikers and Bob Peoples, the owner of the hostel. We knew there was a 5:00pm shuttle to Elizabethton for resupply, so we were glad we made it in time. (This is where Lipstick and I received the phone call regarding TwinkleToes needing a clinic in 2008)
ForgetMeKnot and I slept in the tree house instead of the two story hostel. Bob Peoples built it one day when he was bored. It was very nice, slightly bigger than a double bed, with enough space to store your pack and walk around a little bit. Over 20 hikers stayed here tonight. Bob Peoples, a true trail legend superhero. After his hike 20 years ago he bought property and now maintains the trail nearby. He is a true trail angel to the hikers that come through. One of the quotes that is told in the area is ""when Bob Peoples builds a switchback, an angel gets its wings."" He runs a trail maintaining program each May called Hardcore Kincora. Many hikers during the season help on this huge project. 
During the hike today, I hiked over the trail that I helped dig at Hardcore in May, 2013, however, I could not find my spot, very disappointed. I discussed this with Bob and he said I definitely hiked over it.
There had been a fire and hikers had to redirected, this reopened a week ago.

Five of us did that slack pack and decided to slack 5 more miles. It was a beautiful hike over Pond Mountain and by Laurel Creek Falls. ForgetMeNot and I soaked our feet at Laurel Creek Falls. So at 2:00 he took us back to Watauga Lake and we hiked 8 more miles, 4 miles past Watauga Dam. Southpaw set up camp because of a threat of a storm coming in. I elected to hike on because ForgetMeNot had already passed. She expecting us at the Vandeventer Shelter. It was a very hard climb, however, not as tough as when I hiked it in 2007 with Silver. They have added 15 switch backs where I nearly quit. I fondly remember Silver coming back and stating, you will NOT quit! So I hiked on. After that mountain, the hiking was much easier!
We arrived at Vandeventer after 7:00pm with a threat of a storm. Since the shelter was full, I set up the tent behind the shelter in high winds. I was safely in the tent getting warm, when the storm hit. This was the first hard rain test for my tent. I was dry and warm all night.

Breakfast has been cereal with vegetable protein added. However, this makes it look unappetizing but Craig was interested and I shared some with him. He liked it and put some in his oatmeal.

I arrived at Abbington shelter at 2:00. I was very pleased to hike the first 8 miles at rate of 2 mph. I anticipated that we would arrive in Damascus by 7:00pm at that rate. However, I was able to hike 2.5 mph and reached Damascus by 6:15! (Cathy says WooHoo!). ForgetMeNot waited for me at the TN/VA border for a photo op and we hiked the last 3.5 miles together. All we talked about was having pizza!
When we arrived we took more photos and headed for the pizza place downtown, Bo Bo McFarlands. When we got there it was closed but Right Lane was across the street and rushed over. He was headed for the other pizza place a half a mile away. I ate more pizza in one sitting than I ever have in my life and I was still not full. A nice addition was a salad bar, so we had salad too! 
When we left, we joked about trying to hitch a ride, Yogiing. We crossed the road and immediately got a ride with Nanca a new trail angle who moved to Mountain City and was traveling home from work. She and her husband are future thru-hikers so she was excited to give us a ride. Her husband just accepted the Pastorate at Mountain City. She dropped us off and we headed to The Place, which is the hostel maintained by the Methodist church in Damascus. There were at least 20 other hikers settled in. They opened up a new room for us and we were the first to use it. The room upstairs with 2 showers in it is now closed off. We know several of the hikers here so it was fun catching up. We plan to take a zero day tomorrow doing laundry, going to the Outfitters (look at stuff). I need new boots!
Trail Legend, Baltimore Jack passed away yesterday at the Hospital near Franklin. I saw him when I was in Franklin near the Budget Inn while riding by. I walked over but to talk with him but I couldn't find him at that point. When I was in Kincora, I was surprised he wasn't there as he normally travels with the bubble (the Thru-hikers of that season).
News from the Home Front: Tim says when he's sad, he gets a Happy Meal. However, he is planning to contact the Law Firm of Estes, Garman, & Right to sue for false advertising!

I woke up early so I called Cathy and we caught up on the journal and had a great time chatting and reminiscing about our hiking adventures in 2008. That year we ended our hike in Damascus so we both knew the Trail here well. 
Mojo's was our breakfast destination. I was pleasantly greeted as I entered by none other then Nanca's husband! She had described us to him and he had also seen us in town the day before. It was great to meet Con and chat with him for a while. 
Of course we were still missing Southpaw, so we wandered around town hearing reports that he had arrived. Finally we found him at Crazy Larry's, another hostel. We needed laundry done and it seems that Crazy Larry's is the only place in town for that. So we had to wait over 3 hours for clean clothes. While waiting, I walked around town trying to find a piano to play. None of the Churches were open and no one had a lead on any, but it was fun trying. 
Limey was still in town after a double zero and caught up with him for supper at BoBo McFarland's. Susan, his wife was in town too and we enjoyed meeting her. Tomorrow we will leave Damascus, only to be back in a week for Trail Days. I look forward to a great reunion!
Damascus is the home of the annual Trail Days festival, and is known as Trail Town USA due to the convergence of four scenic trails in the town, including the Appalachian Trail, U.S. Bicycle Route 76, The Iron Mountain Trail, and the Virginia Creeper Trail. Damascus also is on the route of the Daniel Boone Heritage Trail and the Crooked Road Music Heritage Trail. The Trail Days festival is held around the middle of May each year and draws in excess of 20,000 tourists, making it the largest single gathering of Appalachian Trail hikers anywhere.

Just then, a hiker came in to put her old pack in the hiker box. ForgetMeNot was interested in the pack since she is using a borrowed pack. It fit!! Crazy Larry agreed to hold it for her to pick up next week.
Today's hike began with a section on the Creeper Trail, a nice flat walk. Then into the woods we went with a couple of long climbs, returning to the Creeper. Back to the woods, then a third time to the Creeper, this time, for almost a mile!! Intermittent rain hit all day, twice changing to sleet. Arriving at Lost Mountain shelter late, I did not expect a spot and it was full. But I set up in a nice spot in the woods and slept great!

Southbound slackers carried snacks and drinks for us. Thanks to Victory, Lucky, Doug, and Little Santa. Doug is the hiker who helped me over the triple blow-down days ago, so I was glad to see him and get his picture.
At Buzzard Rock, a hiking club was having lunch. Inquiring where they were from, I learned that some were with the Oldtimers who hiked Roan Mountain 8 days before! That was the day I asked at least ten southbounders to greet Chicken Feet by name. Four of these hikers today were there. They said everyone had fun with my idea. When I saw Limey, he said, ""Chicken Feet was a trail celebrity that day! Everyone greeted him by name and some even gave him snacks."" Many thanks to the Oldtimers!
Elk Park has a beautiful climb and you can see several hikers in the picture. At some point today, there was snow on the mountain. I arrived at Thomas Knob Shelter and it was full. ForgetMeNot said there was one space way in the back on the second floor, but I elected to tent. Hard winds blew all night, with intermittent rain, so I did not sleep well. Maybe I should have taken the shelter spot.

Rain was intermittent but the wind blew the rain into the tent. My intentions to get up early were busted when I looked outside to thick fog and mist. So I gave up and tried to sleep. Finally giving up, I decided to make coffee. Limey was tenting next to me so I told him to get his coffee cup ready. ""ARE YOU SERIOUS?"" I love doing Trail Magic while hiking. I served Limey's coffee to him in his tent. When we sent the picture to his wife she replied, ""IWOX, don't spoil him!"" Sorry, Susan, I have been a Trail Angel for nine years and a thru hiker for only 7 weeks. 
Hiking began at 9:00am. The fog continued. Then the winds began at the top of the mountain. We estimated over 50 miles an hour. It was difficult to keep from being blown off the trail!! Visibility was low but the rock scrambles were a lot of fun, except that Southpaw had his first fall. We're glad it was minor. When the fog finally cleared, the views were spectacular! Then we hiked right by the famous ponies of Grayson Highlands. A great day of hiking ended with a spot in the Old orchard Shelter, and a nice fire built by a nice young section hiker, Gray Straps.

Cell service was non existent at the shelter so I stopped at the first mountain top to call my Mom to wish her a belated happy Mother's Day. Since power is an issue with this phone, I try to conserve energy a lot. At the first road crossing, I got a banana as Trail Magic from a maintainer. Chatting with him, I learned his girlfriend works at Shenandoah National Park and knows my friend Mark, who also works there. Mark graduated from Sanderson High School with me in Raleigh, NC. So I sent a trail message to Mark.
Today, the terrain was gentle so we arrived early at Trimpy Shelter and secured our spot.

So we needed to hightail it 10 miles to meet the schedule. On the trail at 7:00am, this was the earliest start yet. 11 hours of sleep helped.  I made the 10 miles by 11:40 am. A hitch was secured in record time. We got our groceries at Walmart, then headed to McDonalds. Southpaw ate a Big Mac and two large chocolate shakes. I started with a quarter pounder, then could not resist getting a shake too, but only a medium.ForgetMeNot was able to find all of her favorite vegetables at Ingles. She is a very healthy eater!

There was an old player piano and it was horribly out of tune, but I played it anyway. The lady that worked in the museum had fun with that. She took videos and said she was going to put that on their Face Book page. Southpaw thought it sounded like a saloon even though I was playing a hymn! When we arrived in Atkins, Southpaw had a 1 lb hamburger, 2 half lb patties on one bun. Then we proceeded to hike what the book said was 4 miles, but we did it in less than 2 hrs. Don't think it was correct, but it means we have now hiked one fourth the way!
Last thing for the day, we came upon an old shelter with a privy. It looked like a tree had fallen on the shelter and they did not rebuild it. There was No water source, maybe water source had dried up, another reason not to rebuild. We ended up at a camp ground at 547.2 miles and had a nice time with a little bit of rain.

I turned in my poles before the shower, had my feet washed and massaged while waiting, ahhhhhhh.  I spoke to one of the doctors at the Ministry, I asked his opinion about me switching to low hiking boots, trailrunners instead of my high tops, heavy boots. He said there is a risk of changing from something that works to something we don't know if it works. He said I couldn't injure my ankle anymore but the change may cause discomfort in hiking.All of us went to the library, worked on little projects. Chicken Feet came in to town. We haven't seen him in 3 weeks, he's way ahead us. Many hikers leave the trail for a short time to travel south to enjoy the Hiker Reunion/Trail Days and then return where they left off north, usually by Sunday or Monday. We were in the Hiker Parade, got sprayed with water hoses, buckets of water and super soakers.

12 miles was the goal for the day, in spite of starting at noon. Being only two miles in, Knot Maul Shelter was a nice spot for a quick break. After 9 miles there is what the guide book calls a clearing. This should be named a spot like the balds on Beauty Spot. This place was spectacular! With over two miles of open pasture, the views were great. By now it was cold, with a strong wind. I sent home my winter gear and now have a Hennesey hammock and a Sierra Designs Backcountry Bed. I really wanted to try the new gear. However, it was so cold, I was grateful to get a spot in the Chestnut Ridge Shelter. Southpaw had hung his hammock in the shelter so I could have the last spot.

IWOX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534434,"By getting up at 6:30 am, I was first to hike out, even after soaking my feet near Dismal Falls. I hiked as fast as I could so I could get a bunk at Woods Hole Hostel. I got bunk #11 out of 17. The mattress was one of the most comfortable on the Trail. Volunteering to help with supper, I washed pots and pans for an hour and a half. (Don't tell my husband) 
ForgetMeNot helped make pasta for lasagna. The salad was so good, Southpaw ate two helpings. Dessert was homemade ice cream. We took lots of pictures because the experience was so great, along with all the organic food.

IWOX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534438,"Breakfast was another great meal: French toast, eggs, sausage, fruit, coffee and juice. Southpaw and I hiked out. We were to meet new trail angels John and Gina to stay at their cabin. On the trail, two hikers told us that ForgetMeNot had decided to stay at Woods Holes another night. That was strange but we could work something out. 
Two hours later, ForgetMeNot caught up. She had inquired about work for stay to know her options in the future. The hikers overheard and misinterpreted it to mean she was staying. The three of us then hiked together to Pearisburg. Most of the 11 miles were easy but the mud slowed us down drastically when we had to constantly keep from sliding or falling. 
New trail angel John picked us up to take us to his family cabin on Big Walker River. First we went to the post office to get a goody box from Phoenix Rising. BOY did she pack that box!: homemade cookies, lots of snacks, Epsom salts, foot soap, drink mix, candy, and soup. Thanks Phoenix Rising from all three of us! The postmistress even ate a cookie. 
The bad news was that the replacement sleeping bag did NOT arrive. John took us to resupply, our biggest ever for seven days. Then on to the cabin, about 30 minutes from Pearisburg. What a great place! The cabin was built by John's family in 1933 with local lumber from the mill at the dam. We walked to the dam and played in the water. John grilled steaks for supper with lots of vegetables as sides. For the second day in a row I washed dishes. Then we had a fun evening of music and playing Uno. Our sleeping accommodations were in the attic kind of like the hostel with six beds up there. A great day!

In the first half mile there was a nice waterfall, then mud, mud, mud. It took an hour to get through that section. Mud was the theme of the day, slowing us down drastically. However, we planned only seven miles so it did not hurt us too much. I missed a turn for the first time and hiked an extra mile, again, fortunately on a short day. We had seven days of food so pack weight was the heaviest ever. I felt very fortunate to get a spot in Rice Field Shelters. I took pictures in West Virginia and Virginia before a storm moved in. It was a hard rain, but we were warm and dry.

We went over just for fun and were treated to sodas by the captain. As we were leaving, a thunder storm hit, so we ran back to the Captains porch for cover. Southpaw was chilled, so he waited out the storm in the sauna. The storm was short so we hit the trail. Not 15 minutes later another storm hit, and this one wasn't short. It started with hail, then settled in for the next three hours. When I arrived at the shelter, it was full, but the hikers made a spot for me. Even though I was a little chilled, I was able to get dry clothes on and get warm quickly.

Again, it was minor. (IWOX 3; Southpaw 2). There were 2 major climbs, so it was a long day. As always, I talk to all the hikers who pass, because I enjoy hearing where they are from and where they intend to hike. I forgot to mention Train Wreck yesterday, who hiked with me a long time. He is from Ohio and out here for two weeks. He realized he did not bring enough warm clothes so he took a pair of women's pants from the hiker box at Woods Hole. It was fun to hear him telling this when ForgetMeNot said, ""Those were my pants."" We all arrived at the shelter exhausted, and I was glad to hear that even some of the younger crowd thought the day's climbs were tough. Two section hikers helped me put up my hammock because they wanted to see how it was done. It went up fast with the extra hands. Two hikers at the shelter, Nala and So Free started the same day as us, and we have seen them many times. It was great to see them again!

He hiked by me barefooted so I asked if his feet were tough. ""Yes."" Your trail named should be Tough Feet, but spell it TuffFeet. He likes it. I made another friend today when Westy caught up. He was slacking, but he stayed with me on a tough climb. The book notes two views on a rocky ridge, but I say there were at least ten great views over half a mile that included many rock scrambles. One hiker ran out of water on the ridge and was having a rough day. When Southpaw learned of the problem, he waited and gave the hiker some water. Now that's Trail Magic!  At the end of the day we crossed a road and Westy's wife was waiting in the Westfalia, so I met her and got a picture.

Train Wreck hiked with me in the morning and made the time go by quickly. His first undergrad degree is in geology, so I learned quite a lot, especially about fracking because he worked in the gas and oil industry in the 80s. After 7 miles, we descended to the road and Trail Magic! Connie and Mark had driven from Georgia and set up for a week. They cook all day. Lunch consisted of a hot dog, chips with Nacho cheese, hamburger casserole, grilled cheese in tortillas, grilled peanut butter sandwich with maple syrup and a ginger ale. Can you believe I ate all that? (Yes, you are a Thru-hiker burning 4,000 - 6,000 calories a day!) First Trail Magic ever for Train Wreck, and he had sectioned over 20 years. 
We made the difficult departure and said goodbye to Connie and Mark. They do this because their daughter thru hiked in 2014. 
I thought the next five miles to Dragons Tooth would never end! Once on the top of the mountain, the trail followed a rocky ridge that slowed the pace down to a mile an hour. Dragons Tooth is a neat rock formation, so we spent some time exploring. We didn't know the worst was yet to come! Descending from there, we had to use our first metal stairs embedded in the rocks. Then there were ledges 3 inches wide to traverse, ending with sitting and sliding down the rocks. Two miles of this with an occasional break. I was glad to arrive at the Four Pines Hostel at 7:00pm. We shuttled to a convenience store for a BLT, then I slept in a barn. A great day on the AT!

Today, Yackey hiked with us. After 5 miles we arrived at Tinker Cliffs for several beautiful views. The trail led right over the rocks for quite a ways. We only planned a 10 mile day to a temporary campsite, due to a shelter being closed because of bear trouble. We later passed someone who had bear trouble at that shelter. He was surrounded by 6 bears. He was alone and the bears knew what they were doing! BUT, he had a gun and scared them away! He also carries bear spray. Scary thing is, we had lunch at THAT shelter. Part of an article on the net WDBJ7: Earlier this week, officials closed the Lamberts Meadow Shelter and campsite. They said the bears were reluctant to leave when hikers tried to scare them away. There have been reports of up to six bears spotted there multiple times in last few days. Diana Christopulos with the Appalachian Trail Club said they are attracted to food being left behind by hikers.I also ran into hiker So Free. Here's a ""shout out"" to So Free's Mother who is reading this journal. Wish I had taken his picture! The caption would have been ""Hi Mom!"" When we arrived at the temporary site, we decided to push on to Daleville, especially because Yackey offered to share his hotel room. So we are swathed in luxury after a big meal at Cracker Barrel. 
Note from Cathy: I asked Jill where she was since she quickly called me to respond to a text. She said she was waiting for Southpaw to come out of Krogers Grocery Store and further stated, ""He'll probably shop for an hour and come out with 3 items. Ha, ha!""

We got our resupply done and Southpaw was able to acquire a Frosty from Wendy's. I barely stuck out my thumb for a hitch when a car stopped. Thanks Rud for getting us back to the motel so quickly! We hit the trail again at 12:30, got another quick hitch to do another 9 miles. The Mountain Laurels are peaking everywhere. I also took a picture of a new white flower.

I also planned to pick up Rightlane who would reach Rockfish Gap around 11:00am. I didn't tell ForgetMeNot so it would be a nice surprise for her. After picking him up, we drove straight to the YMCA so he could shower and smell better when we went to lunch. We then dinned at Ming Garden, the all you can eat Chinese Buffet in Waynesboro. Some of my former coworkers joined us to make a nice party.  Charlottesville was the next stop. We visited John, whose cabin we had stayed in a week ago and who had carried some gear back for us (two boxes of gear and extra food thanks to Phoenix Rising.) Finding we had a little extra time, I called my son Logan and asked him to fix us some coffee. So we had a nice visit with him and Renee, along with the excellent coffee. It was hard to say goodbye to ForgetMeNot and we will never forget her. She left us for her 24 hour bus trip to Quebec. 
The next item on the schedule was to check out new shoes for Rightlane and me. Rightlane replaced his boots and I downsized to trail runners. Again, supper was fantastic, compliments to Chicken Feet and Tim!

The tenters nearby said they wished they had hammocks because the rain beat thru their vestibules and the dirt piled up the sides of their tents. We hiked about 15 miles. It threatened rain all day, but never did. When we came to a gap there was Gentle G, the German giving trail magic. He is off the trail. Hiking 2 months was great, he just didn't want to continue for four more.
His friend Kay was there too. Then, while we were talking, in walked Jules from the same town in Germany! They had previously met on the trail. Jules had a stress fracture in her right foot in Hot Springs. She hiked on it after 6 days rest. Then at trail days, the 1 Way Ministry Clinic found her blood pressure to be 200 over 140! After getting on medication she hiked on.

It was named after Mr. Foot. 
We did not make our goal. The climb after the Foot bridge was tough. Then we entered bear country and had to either stop at 14 miles or go the full 20. We got word from north blunders that the campsite we were targeting was closed due to bear activities, so we stopped. Tomorrow we have to do at least 15 miles to get thru the bear problem areas.

4.9 miles later we arrived at the awesome 3 level Bryant Ridge Shelter, a beautiful shelter! It says 20 could sleep but easily 30+ could sleep there with the two stories plus a big deck area. We took a break there and was told trail magic was at Jennings Creek, 3.7 miles away! Needlessly to say, I so looked forward to THAT trail magic. The hike was a couple of long ups but mostly down so it was a fast hike.
Since we had not seen anyone we knew yesterday while hiking, I was not expecting to see anyone I knew today. So, when I saw Cheeks around the corner, we started cheering and jumping up and down! We had met Cheeks in the Smokies and we had shuttled her to Trail Days. I knew she was far behind me because she took days off to do Hardcore after Trail Days. But I was very, very happy to see her. I said good-bye to Cheeks and hiked on. Just when I had given up, along came Big Bird. He had spent the night at Jennings Creek so we were 8.7 miles apart the night before. But both of them had considered hiking to Bryant Ridge Shelter, so here we were, one mile before our finish and I finally see him!  When we arrived at Jennings Creek, I immediately went to the trail magic consisting of coke, bagels with cream cheese. I had a sandwich with cream cheese and strawberry jam and nuts and cheese. Cupcake, a 2014 hiker was providing the trail magic. THANK YOU! When Tim and Rightlane arrived for the shuttle, I still had Tim stop and get a quarter pounder!After relaxing at home for awhile we went to the hiker feed at the Grace Lutheran Church Hiker Hostel in Waynesboro! What a great reunion! Rightlane saw people he had met a month ago. We knew over half the hikers there, about 15. Some of them we had just met three days ago when Southpaw and I hiked south. Dinner consisted of lots of lasagna, salad, corn on the cob and many delicious desserts!
Rightlane is a Middle School Band Instructor. The evening concluded with us making a recording of the song Shenandoah. Fun! He played the saxophone while I played the piano.
Update on Rightlane: We had taken them out last Friday June 3 and sent him north with Chickenfeet. On Saturday morning Chickenfeet ordered Rightlane to call and get his foot checked out. So, right after Tim dropped us off at Tye River, Tim had to then drive 30 miles north of our house to pickup Rightlane. They went directly to an urgent care center. The X-ray showed no break in the foot, so they referred him to a specialist, Dr. Godette who had incidentally operated on Tim's back in the past.
Rightlane was resting at the Byrdhouse until Tuesday when the specialist could see him. Rightlane was very pleased with Dr. Godette because he found a slight strain which is the minor problem. The more serious issue was that his second and third toe was pressing on a nerve. He had him order an orthotic to correct this condition. On Wednesday, Tim took him hiking on Rip Rap Trail to test out the orthotic. Today, everything is better, so Rightlane will hike out on tomorrow. He plans to do shorter miles to be sure the foot is not hurting.
All is well in the hiking world! Check out the new photos added in yesterdays post, 6/8, just received!!

IWOX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537845,"14 miles counted from March. I hiked some miles locally in March to build in a zero day at home. Southpaw is hiking those miles today. First I take Rightlane to Swift Run Gap to hike out. Then I am taking care of business at home. Also, I am playing my piano and my saxophone. It is a great relaxing day!

IWOX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537847,"900 Miles done!! We hiked 14 miles today and passed the 900 mile milestone. We slack packed southbound from Powell Gap to Doyles River parking. First, I saw a bear! I barely got the bear in the picture.
 We passed through the 8000 acre burn area in the Shenandoah Park. We ran into O.D., Flash and Wolverine. A bear had gotten into O.D.'s food so she was a little short. I gave her half of my snacks and Southpaw gave her almost a pound of cheese and a pound of summer sausage. We delivered ""Slack Magic!"" Therefore we visited the camp store at Loft Mountain for snacks. Then it was great to see Pookie again. After we got to the car we went to Loft Mountain Wayside for blackberry shakes. I was not impressed. I will not buy another one. My strawberry smoothies at home are much better.
 So Free was at the Wayside recouping. Maybe we will catch up with Nala and Wicks too. I went to Loft Mountain Campground to see if my friend Mark was working. He had called in sick today. We graduated from High School together in Raleigh, NC. I was sorry to miss him, but I will connect after I finish. This was a great day on the trail.

IWOX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537994,"I dropped Southpaw off early to catch the last 5 miles I had hiked in March. While waiting for him, I visited my friend Eddie. He let me know I missed his 56th birthday on May 7th. Also, we missed a play in Crimora, and will miss the next one. We will go in November, and I will be Raffle Queen again. Southpaw and I made it to Church at Smyrna. It was one day that no pianist was available, so I played for the service! Our plans then changed to slackpacking again. We hit the trail around 3:00pm at Powell gap and hiked 14.5 miles to Lewis Mountain Campground. I ran into some maintainers, and O.D. slacking south. At dusk, the wildlife came out: We saw two bears and many deer. I did not see the second bear until I was 12 feet away from it! Then it ran away. The hike ended at 9:30 pm, our first night hiking! I saw many pairs of deer eyes glowing from my headlight. So we drove home again, arriving after 11:00pm very tired. Monday will be tough with a full pack! Rightlane update: I received a text from Rightlane Saturday night. He had ripped a toenail right off and could not put weight on that foot. I texted him back that we could pick him up if he needed to be picked up.
When I reached him by phone, he had a miracle to report. While hiking he met 2 PATC (Potomac Appalachian Trail Club) Maintainers. They were concerned about his limping. When he explained the situation. They asked, ""Can we pray with you?"" He replied, ""Of course."" That night he slept better than he had in a long time. He woke up with the foot much improved. He is hiking north. P.S. Tim said the thought of him coming back to Tim's cooking made him high tail it north!
Message from Tim. Jill got another FitBit, it is for her jaw. She has yapped her way to California and back in one week!

Next, we headed to Rock Spring Hut and got spots in the shelter. Met Little Bear who had seen friends of mine we had missed at Swift Run Gap. We hope to get an earlier start tomorrow.

IWOX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538472,"Southpaw owes me big time! While finishing my packing, I found Southpaw's Gatorade bottle. It was heavy, but I knew he would need it so I carried it. He told me I should have dumped it, but I did not know if he had water, so I packed it. He did hike back when he made the discovery. Then, at Skyland, I noticed he had been overcharged by over $4, and I got the cashier to refund the money. Lastly, I Yogied a ride back to the trail. So, I will collect some day!
The hike today was one of the most beautiful on the whole trail so far! There were so many views, both east and west. The trail conditions were great with a lot of rock walls probably built by the CCC boys. We arrived at Pass Mountain Hut and got spaces again.

IWOX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538513,"Plan was to go to Elkwallow wayside for lunch. We left Pass Mountain Hut and Southpaw arrived at 10:30 and I arrived at 11:30. There was a power outage so there was no cooked food available. We ate snacks and waited to see if the power came back on, it did! We ate grilled lunches as planned. We left Elkwallow and arrived at Gravel Springs Hut which was a 13.1 miles day and arrived at 5:00pm for an easy evening, which we had not done for awhile. It was very relaxing. We enjoyed the company of Ranger and a section hiker named Packrat, Mothly Stud, Little Debbie, a blind hiker called Lynn and her service dog Rhonda. Rhonda slept partially on my sleeping bag.
Cute story about Mothly Stud:
Back in 2013, when he was section hiking, his trail name was Cuddles. One night, everyone had settled down in the shelter. After dark, a woman came in and noisily started cooking in the shelter area. She even began smoking! She was chatting with other hikers and saying that she couldn't decide whether to stay in the shelter or tent. Cuddles said, ""I'll make a space for you right here."" She tented. I don't think I would have tented! This year, the Mothly Stud did not want to use Cuddles as his trail name and his friends tried to convince him to use the name Studly. However, he was not comfortable with that, he thought it sounded like he was bragging. Another hiker made it his mission to create a new name for him. One day a moth flew into his ear. He asked another hiker to get the moth out of his ear. The other hiker couldn't see the moth in his ear. So, they hiked on. All of a sudden the moth flew out of his ear, witnessed by the other hiker. The hiker with the mission came up with the name Mothly Stud and wrote a poem about this event and wrote ""To the Mothly Stud"" and tacked it to a post, saying ""You know who you are"", followed by the poem.

The excitement of the day occurred at the laundromat. One of the owners was fixing one of the machines and it flooded everywhere. One of the customers said to him, ""You were the Principal of my Middle school and I was in your office a lot!"" Then I watched this former principal use the window squeegee to shove the water out the front door! I said to him, ""This is more entertaining than watching hikers throw bear lines. Then we had a nice chat. I explained what a bear line was and he stated that I had just hiked past his house getting to Front Royal. We are staying at the Mountain Cabbin Hostel, a very cute 1780 colonial log cabin that was renovated, made into an 8 person bunkhouse. This evening we were given a grand tour of the original farm house built in 1847 with additions in 1869. It is in the process of being renovated to be a Bread and Breakfast with owner living quarters on the second floor. Extensive and costly work. Very interesting tour!

Racoon (Ed) begins his 5 day hike with the group. I will be at road crossings along the way to greet hikers as they come through and offer them drinks and treats. My first spot was 5 miles in to their day at Hwy 66 and 725, 8 miles out of Front Royal where I parked, set up 2 canvas chairs and a variety of sweet desserts and assortment of individually packaged chips. About an hour in, 2 ladies walked across the road and explained that they were giving out food about 2 blocks away on the trail and I was welcome to come join them. I did after my group came through, great time! We had about 10 chairs set up. They had deli meat, bread, condiments and all kinds of treats from M&Ms, cookies, pastries and fruit. They lived about 30 minutes away and thru-hiked last year and wanted to pay back for all the great trail magic they received. They were there from 9:00am til 7:30pm. About 30 hikers came trough, less than expected because of the bad storm that came through last night. Some hikers chose to take a day in Front Royal to dry out and resupply.Jill's account of the day will come later.

The deck had a nice Adirondack chair. Then we headed to route 522 where Lipstick had ice cold sodas and snacks. The trail was devastated by the storm with many blowdowns. Arriving at Manassas Gap shelter, we learned that a tree had fallen on our friend Downunder's tent, missing him by inches. Racoon is hiking 5 days with us.

While Racoon and I hiked on, Southpaw and Rightlane took a long break at the first shelter. Since it was Saturday, many day hikers were out. I asked about 15 of them to greet Rightlane as Rightwing, since he had been mistakenly called that and insisted he is definitely not right wing. My fun worked, with at least 10 greetings. Two young ladies even told him, "" You need to step it up, IWOX is getting impatient!"" At route 55, Lipstick was waiting with snacks, so we took a nice break. Rod Hollow shelter area is packed full of tents. As I was watching Rightlane put up his tent, I heard a deep voice say, ""IWOX!"" It was Downunder's voice. I ran and hugged him, telling him how very glad I was to see him. Now it is Hiker Midnight: 9:00pm....Zzzzzz

The roller coaster is 13 climbs in 13 miles, and we planned to do 10 miles of it to Bears Den. I had hiked this in 2009, but I did not remember how hard it was. The climbs were not as bad as the rocks, which drastically slows down hiking speed. Southpaw and Rightlane took 7 hours , while Racoon and I took 8. Then we headed to an outfitter about 7 miles away for new hiking shoes for Racoon. Tim drove to Bears Den Hostel for the evening. We enjoyed pizza and ice cream and are snug in our bunks at hiker midnight.

Finally, we coasted the last three miles to David Lesser Shelter. Cathy here: I heard that the shelter received trail magic from a man that came in from the nearby neighborhood. Southpaw enjoyed the beer and peach pie while the rest of them missed out. They were tented in a campsite about a football field distance away! I was unable to find them today, the locals could not direct me from the AT map. However, the next morning I thought to stop in an auto parts store and the clerk was very familiar with the area and explained the location to me, I was so frustrated to not find them. I stayed in Charles Town and visited the beautiful Hollywood Casino, lost $30 at the Blackjack table, lowest limit table was $15, ugh.

The psychological halfway point (real halfway is about 73 miles north of here) The 8 miles was very fast, probably because I was so anxious to get to the ATC. I wanted to get my picture in the book and see who had already hiked in. I checked in as #888. It was a nice meeting place as hikers we know came in all afternoon. Garlic Man works at the outfitter so I visited him too. He lived in Pittsboro, NC near my Mom for several years and I saw him many times when I was in town. It was great to see him. Thanks for the ice cream, Garlic Man!
I talked with Laurie Poteiger and Peter Pan who work at the ATC, who I had met at Trail Days many times. Laurie informed me that Babu was in town. (I had mistakenly thought he would not be around). When I phoned him, he offered his house for the night! The only glitch was there is no furniture. This is a townhouse that Babu had just bought and is fixing up to rent. He is staying there temporarily. Of course, we did not care, it would be a great shelter in the storms that were predicted. Southpaw, Rightlane, Downunder and I set up our sleeping bags and mats in the living room. Then we watched the storm roll in, while we enjoyed pizza. Racoon and Lipstick came by and we said goodbye. It was great to have Racoon hike with us for 5 days. Thanks Lipstick for all the Trail Magic!

 By the time we reached the shelter, we were BFFs. Then we got the giggles at the shelter. Rightlane said we were acting like his middle school girls. Whatever anyone said made us laugh even harder. Downunder shared some of his leftover potatoes with me and I acted like it was the best gift I had ever received. He said he didn't know all he needed to make a woman happy was potatoes and he would try that tactic back in Australia when he returned.

I had a late lunch at a tavern, but that didn't stop me from having lots of pizza later. We stayed at the Allenberry Resort, which is being sold and only rents to hikers as a courtesy. On a floor of 20 rooms, only 4 were rented. It was fun to have the whole floor virtually to ourselves.

Jeanette invited me then to stay at their house when I hike. 
Jeanette and Chuck drove two vehicles to pick us up, take us to Burger King, then shopping and then to their home. We enjoyed baked ziti, burgers and hotdogs, salad and roasted corn on the cob.

They knew about the huge rock climb in the first mile, so they offered a slack pack. Because of the state of my feet, and not wanting to slow the group, I carried only water, snacks and my raincoat.  The climb was fabulous! It was technically the most difficult so far, but it was short in comparison to some others, taking about 45 minutes. It was fun because all 6 of us stayed together. Being very foggy, there were no views. Fortunately, the rain held off. The afternoon was drizzly. The PA rocks still gave some trouble, making my arrival at the Leroy Smith Shelter late. White Owl saw a storm coming on the radar, so I ate quickly and went to bed by 8:00pm. I remember the storm starting, but I slept thru the ending.

Then there's a gap, meaning you will descend, but then you will have to climb up the other side. Sometimes, the downhill can be even harder than the up. Today we reached Wind Gap. Both descent and ascent were small challenges. 7 miles later we crossed Wolf Rocks, a long stretch of Boulder hopping.
Shortly, we came to a camping spot where two teenage boys were set up. The 16 year old was making a documentary of the AT and wanted to interview us with a video camera. We agreed and spent about a half hour discussing our hikes with him. If his video goes viral and I become famous, I will take care of all my journal readers. The camping spot past Kirkridge Shelter was our home for the night. It was an open field with a great view. Since there was no place close for my hammock nearby, I set it up as a tent for the first time. It will do in rare cases, but I didn't have much headroom. We watched fireworks in the distance then headed to bed.

We encouraged Flash to contact Wolverine's Mom and gave him options for getting help: hopefully the staff at the Mohican Outdoor Center could help. Then, Turnip came over and said he was sick. We gave him the same advice. Wolverine had several tick bits. Turnip did not have any ticks, so hopefully he doesn't have Lyme. I spent a lot of time praying for their recoveries. 
The objective for the day was a diner in Branchville, NJ for supper, around 15 miles. The terrain still has rocks. Hiking today were two groups from summer camps. The first group was about 50 kids with Type 1 diabetes. They were having a great time! Since they were hiking North, it took a long time to get by the group. I enjoyed their questions: I was asked my trail name at least 20 times. Some asked how far I had hiked and were impressed with the 1300 miles, with 900 to go. Finally reaching the front of the group, I was told by one young girl, ""You can do it, I believe in you!""
The second group was about 20 teenagers out for 40 miles. I like seeing people out enjoying the trail. 
When we finally reached Branchville, the diner was closed, the steakhouse next door was closed, so we walked to a tavern. The bacon cheeseburger was delicious, and we dined outside by Lake Kittatinny. We then hiked about a mile up to a nice viewpoint, set up camp and watched the sunset.

We looked forward to a break at Lake Tiorati, but almost six miles separated us from the lake. I barely hiked 1 mile per hour. After passing over the thruway, the Lemon Squeezer was a real challenge, followed by abrupt ups and downs. The break at the lake was much appreciated. A soda and ice cream sandwich was first, followed by lunch and swimming. South-bounders told us all the water sources were dry, so we headed for the visitor center on the Palisades Parkway. Fortunately, we had 4 miles of relatively easy terrain. We had to run across two lanes of the parkway. The off trail hike was .4 to get to the water faucet. Since it was after 6:00pm, White Owl suggested we cook there. Sure! This meant less weight to carry to the shelter, but also hiking past sunset, arriving at the shelter at 9:00pm. Tents were visible before the shelter. I thought someone had a dog, but it was a bear!  It had dragged someone's pack off and knocked over her tent! We scared it off, but only a few yards. All the hikers were at the shelter and came out. One used an air-horn and the bear ran off. It took about 15 minutes before they found the girl's pack, it was back up the trail. Rightlane's tent was the only other one up, so we believe another disaster was averted by our arrival. The evening ended by watching the full moon rise.

Then there was a difficult down, followed by a climb up Bear Mountain. My reward was the view of the area that I remember driving through to my Grandparent's house. Then there were vending machines used to quench our thirst. I topped that off by climbing up the Bear Mountain Tower, which isn't required on a thru-hike. Another steep decent got us to Hessian Lake for lunch. I had a delicious half pound burger and fries and was uncomfortably stuffed! Staying in the air conditioning for an extra hour also helped. The Trail then went through a zoo with the Bear exhibit being the lowest point on the whole AT at 177 feet. Then we walked across the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge. White Owl counted about 30 people who waved to us from their cars. The next six miles were really hard, made even more difficult by high humidity. We were able to get a break at a convenience store; pizza for supper and cold drinks. A local named Paul came over and said he had waved to us on the bridge earlier and was now on his way home. He gave me some ice cold water which was greatly appreciated! Thanks Paul!
 We headed to camp at the Graymoor Spiritual Center where they let hikers camp on a ball field. It had running water, a shower (cold water) and electricity. We were happy. I was also glad to see Limey, who had been several days ahead, but he took 3 zero days. Bandana was also there. He is from Japan and I have seen him many times.

I fixed myself a cup also, maybe I would hike faster. Since the terrain was gentle, I did hike faster, but the coffee helped. We passed Nuclear Lake and cooled down by using our hats to pour water on our heads. It felt great, but made a mess of my sweaty hair. 
Nuclear Lake was a site of a nuclear fuel-processing research facility until 1972. After the Park Service acquired the lands for the A.T., buildings were razed and the area tested extensively and given a clean bill of health, dispelling fears that the lake was contaminated and allowing the Trail to be rerouted along the shore.
New York has a boardwalk, about .3 miles long. The area is a big swamp. Leaving the swamp, the Trail comes to a railroad stop where you can catch a train to New York City. We opted out. The Trail then goes in front of a garden center which is hiker friendly. They have drinks, ice cream and hiker supplies. There is an outdoor shower, this one is cold with no walls, so I rinsed off. We can recharge electronics and relax inside or outside in a gazebo.  A storm passed through, so we waited it out, then hiked to a deli, .6 miles away for supper. New York has been great to have so many deli stops. Reluctantly, we headed up the trail, only to hear the thunder of another storm! Instead of making the next shelter, we stealth camped. Since I was rushing to get the hammock up, I chose too small a tree. It bent over and I slept on the ground.

For a change, the morning was easy. Mt. Prospect was a long 3 miles up and I was pleased to complete it in an hour and a half. Following the climb was a nice gentle decline into Salisbury, CT. We got a quick hitch and bought lunch at LaBonne's Market. Hikers gathered in the courtyard to eat and charge phones. 
For the second time on my hike I got sick. Fortunately, this time I was near a bathroom. We needed to make miles, so we hiked out and I felt better. Again, I think it was bad water.

 Mt. Race had a lot of rocks, then Mt. Everett was a very steep climb, slowing our progress. After Everett we arrived to see Limey eating at Trail Magic.

IWOX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544332,"I have known for two weeks that I would go to Saugerties, NY to White Owl's sister Lettie's house. She is just outside Woodstock, NY and about 10 miles from West Hurley, my childhood home. I have been ecstatic about this break! First, I called my Mom and her friend Myrtle to surprise them. Then I rode around my old neighborhood taking pictures of my friends' houses, my Church and the firehouse. I was hoping to find some friends at home to surprise them. Harriet was home and I got an additional blessing by seeing her daughter Beth, after over 50 years. Bill was also home. He was aware of my hike but surprised none- theless, because the Trail is not very close.
Adding to my happiness is a baby grand piano at Lettie's house, so I have polished the keys. It has rained all day, so it's a great day for a zero!

Cathy here, I was so disappointed that Jill did not have the same fun experience that we did in 2008. I was with Ed for a month in this area. I parked my car 2 miles north of the cabin and hiked south to meet him at the cabin. I arrived first and had a great time talking with several hikers. Great place and we were able to sleep in one of the bunk beds up stairs. Jill, Vachon was even with us and I had picked up Chainsaw a few miles before the trailhead in the previous town where he had waited for a ride for 45 minutes and was about to call a Taxi!:

We got our pancakes and coffee at the shelter. However, it was not worth the suffering we did to get there. They ran out of pancakes before all the hungry hikers had their fill. It was nice to socialize with the other hikers, some of whom we knew. Then we headed out for a 14 mile day, with a break around 5:00 at the Cookie Lady's house. Again, we were disappointed because she closed down before we arrived. She sells drinks, ice cream and other goodies. We were able to buy some raspberries, which didn't last long.  
We have been ending our days with about an hour of singing. I suggested that today we sing rounds. White Owl attempted to sing Row Row Row Your Boat, but could never start or end at the right time. I laughed so hard we had to quit singing for the day.

After resupply, she Yogied another ride back to the trail. The locals who gave us rides were very nice. Today's highlight was Mt. Greylock, the highest point in Massachusetts. It was quite a climb, with some nice views. We dodged a rain storm, but not high winds. We were hopping to eat supper at the restaurant, but could not wait until 7:00pm, so we settled for cake, freshly baked apple cake! We found a great stealth campsite, so goodnight!

The bikes were returned and we spent some time talking to the bike owners. Back on the trail. Walking on the road through town, I saw Robert Bird, who had given me trail magic in Tennessee in April! I ran up and hugged him and he knew me too. We drank sodas and visited Rob for a while. The town break was two hours. Back to the Trail again.

Now to explain the house. In 2008, I met Silver Fox in Virginia. We agreed to hike together the next year. I hiked with her a week for the next 3 years as she finished section hiking the whole AT over 20 years! We have been great friends ever since. She always said I would have a place to stay on my Thru Hike. Unfortunately, she is out of town, so her friend Mike picked us up and dropped us at Phyllis's house. That's what Trail Angels do!

Good news: the dentist took White Owl right away and the problem is not serious: treat with ibuprofen and have his dentist check again later. I bought a new raincoat, food bag (a mouse ate a hole in mine), and a new headlight (I left mine at a campsite.) A convenience store was giving away food so we all got hamburgers, drinks, chips, potato salad and ice cream! Many other hikers were there too. I finally met Timewarp. His parents, Laurie and Kevin housed us back in Vernon, NJ. Then the greatest part of the day: Phyllis was home! She thought she would be out of town until next Wednesday, but made it back today. What a great reunion after five years, and a wonderful surprise!

 IWOX and Trail Talker,
I assume that you are familiar with the trail angel, Miss Janet, who I met yesterday at the trailhead. Obviously, I had never heard of her before but she drove in with this amazing van (see attached picture) and asked her about her work. What an amazing, caring person.
She was bringing one or two people from Bennington, one of whom was a through hiker from Simsbury, CT. I met the mother and siblings of this through hiker on the trail when I was returning to the trailhead. The mother said that her daughter was not far behind her. Not true! The daughter went into town for a critical supply; a 12-pack of drinks for her group at the trailhead. I told her that her mom and siblings were well ahead of her and I that I hoped the drinks would act as a propellant!

Miss Janet was dropping off hikers including our friend Karalyn who is hiking the Long Trail. We had missed her at Bennington and another road crossing where hikers had just been dropped off. It was good to see her again.  I first saw Miss Janet in 2007 at Trail Days, then met her in 2008 with Cathy (Lipstick) and Racoon. Miss Janet remembers Lipstick, so I called and let them talk.

We ate lunch at the Tavern at the Inn, great hamburgers. When our suite was ready, we cleaned up, then got a ride to Rutland with the Trail Angel Maureen from yesterday.

After determining it was not a wild animal in pain, they realized it was their compatriot IWOX, being chased by wildlife. Though it cannot be confirmed by this reporter, it is rumored that her shorts were south of her knees. She attempted to break Usain Bolt's 100 meter record! We determined that she had rudely awakened a peacefully slumbering nest of yellow jackets. To this end, the yellow jackets took exception to being awakened and took retribution on the nether regions of said hiker.  14 stings later, IWOX and yellow jackets are recovering.  Reporters: White Owl and Trail Talker 
When Tim (Jill's husband) read this, he emailed some friends:
Early this morning, Jill went out in the woods to do her
business. She sat on or very near a hornet nest in the
ground. The bees thinking it was a bear, began in rapid
unison to defend their home! Thus, the live retake of
the ""laughing place"" from the movie, Song of the South,
began. Witnesses heard, Beees!!!!! and saw a streak through
the woods that would have made Ray Stevens proud. After
the streak slowed to warp3, a voice rang out, ""Will this make
my butt look big?"" After 14 stings, Jill is doing OK, however,
the bees are in need of serious therapy!
One of their friends, Felicia replied,""I had a visual the entire read. Laughed. And then realized...you are serious! After this 5 month adventure..14 stings! It will be interesting to see if this one hits the journal.""
We had a rough day today. Many hikers ahead planned shorter days and over 50 of us are staying at the Hostel in Glencliff, called Hikers Welcome.
 Mt. Cube was our first obstacle. It took about 5 hours to hike the 5 miles over Mt. Cube. Then the Trail eased up for a few miles. We made the 15 miles to the Hostel, but we were probably the last to arrive around 7:30pm. After eating two ice cream sandwiches, I ate a pizza then another ice cream sandwich. The Hiker hunger is in full swing!
Most hikers chose to tent, so there is a bed for me tonight. Hiker midnight is 9:30 pm after an outside shower that was nice and HOT!

IWOX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547052,"Mt. Moosilauke! Best day thus far! I had been concerned with about this mountain from reports from other hikers. It is a 3000 foot climb to almost 5000 feet over 4.5 trail miles. The climb was difficult, so I was very pleased to finish in 3.5 hours. Mt. Moosilauke is glorious! My first exposure to above tree line was breathtaking! We had a nice break for lunch at the summit with several buddies. The wind was fierce until we climbed down a little. So our confidence was up that we could make the descent of 4 miles in 4 hours. Not possible!!! The guidebook shows steep and it is very steep. White Owl, who struggled a little on the uphill, was in his element on the descent! He boulder hopped like a rabbit! Trail Talker and I could not keep up with him. We were all exhilarated! But the going was slow. It took about 4 hours to make the 3.5 miles. My friend Meredith had recently contacted me to offer assistance in the Whites, so she picked us up at Kinsman Notch. Meredith is a Triple Crowner, meaning she has hiked the AT, the PCT and the CDT! We headed straight for a steak supper at Applebee's, a resupply at Shaw's and beds at Meredith's.

My legs feel much stronger, I just can't make them go faster. We had a nice break at South Kinsman with Fremont. Then it was down and up to North Kinsman. The climb down was SLOW! Since it was Saturday, the trail was like Grand Central Station with Weekend Warriors and day hikers. Someone had told us that the AMC Hut would have hot soup so we held lunch until 3:00, when we arrived. Pumpkin Curry was the soup of the day and it was great! After an hour and a half, we headed for Franconia Notch and a cottage at the Profile Motel. Meredith was bringing our food for the next three days.

Then two miles of steep ups. At 4.5 miles we went above tree line for two miles. The views were great when we could see them. Fog rolled in and out. About 5:00pm the wind was fierce!

Water was a mile away, so I packed up and hiked to breakfast. Of course, it was a very long mile. I ate my breakfast at a spring and waited for the others to catch up. They were not as low on water as I was. A major climb up Mt. Garfield faced us first. The wind was fierce! We spent a few minutes on the summit, then hurried down. We wanted to get to Galehead Hut around lunchtime to get soup. At our current hiking speed it took 5 hours to hike the 5 miles. The soup was potato and dill, was very good. We spent an hour there.

We hiked out by 7:00am and even with stopping at the great views, we arrived at the Zealand Hut before 9:00am for coffee and brownies. Then the fun began!  Finally a long stretch of flat trail with few rocks. We began to believe we could make Crawford Notch by 3:00pm. In fact, we arrived around 2:45. Trail Talker yogied a ride and we were at the AMC Lodge by 3:00. We spent the next 3 hours cleaning up and relaxing before supper. I ate too much at the buffet and was miserable. I suggested we go for a walk. Ha! No takers! Now we are settled down for the night at an 8:30 hiker midnight.

Nadia, who had dined with us last evening, was willing to give us a shuttle. We squeezed into her Yaris, the smallest car she ever owned. The climb was 4000 feet over 3 miles, including many scrambles and crawls. Again, I feel strong and I keep going.  At lunch, Arkansas Traveler came by, I got her picture Cheri! The terrain was rugged and hard. Realizing we would not make many miles, we decided to ask for ""work for stay"" at Mizpah Hut. Not only were we allowed to stay, but we were given Lasagna for a late lunch. Since we arrived before supper, we relaxed in the library while the paying guests ate.
A reward for ""Work for Stay"" was a hot meal. Then we got to sleep in the library. It was warm and cozy.

We had a nice breakfast, then swept the bunk rooms. We enjoyed meeting some of the Hut guests. Today's hike would be short because of the late start and the lack of options to camp between huts.However, the hike was still challenging. We arrived at Lakes of the Clouds Hut around 3:00pm. Knowing it was a risk to ask for Work for Stay, we asked anyway. We were turned down. That was fine, we knew the rules. My only complaint is that the hiker who arrived before us had been offered work for stay. I am considering contacting the AMC to inquire how they are managing this system, when there are inequities in the execution of the rules.
Our only option at this point was to pay $10 to stay in ""the dungeon"". I will have to say that the AMC dungeon beats the Doyle as the worst place to stay on the Trail. Later that evening, over 15 hikers were granted work for stay. Hiker midnight was 8:00pm.

IWOX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547819,"We got an early start from ""the Dungeon,"" around 7:45. The 1.5 mile climb up Mt. Washington was surprisingly easy. We had clear weather, then the clouds rolled in. There was no visibility from the summit. I wanted to call my Mom from the top, but there was no signal. My Mom and Dad had spent their honeymoon at Mt. Washington in 1950. The family story is that they hiked up the Mountain but were exhausted. With no money for the cog railroad trip down, my Dad sweet talked the engineer into taking them down. In order to avoid getting in trouble, the engineer dropped them off about two thirds of the way down, so they still had a rough time hiking down. My Dad, the Marine, even carried my Mom the final distance. They were both worn out, I think some tears were shed.

The hike down Mt. Washington for us got tougher as we descended. Then the climb to Mt. Jefferson began. As we were eating lunch, Nora and Turnip appeared! I haven't mentioned how worried I have been about them. We had last seen them in New Jersey when Turnip was running a fever. I believed they passed us, but I was not seeing any entries in the registers and inquiries of south-bounders gave no sightings. I thought maybe they had gone home. When they walked up, I was ecstatic! I hugged Turnip first, then started crying when I hugged Nora. We were both sobbing and I said, ""I'm SO HAPPY!"" Then we laughed and cried together. I did not have their contact information,so I fixed that right away. I also told them that if I had not seen them, I would have gone to Harper's Ferry to get their email address and I would have written to them. 
We hiked together for a couple hours, then agreed to meet at the next hut. There was no work for stay, only stealth camping down a steep side trail. However, the Croo gave us some leftover food, enchiladas. We made the descent and hiker midnight was 8:00pm. 
This why Mt. Washington is one of the most anticipated part of the AT!

I forgot to add yesterday that Turnip had in fact had a tick related disease and they stayed in Dalton, MA for 10 days, with Turnip very ill. We passed them then. They now have to make up time in order to finish before their visa expires. I hope our friendship continues for a very long time! The hike over Mt. Madison was another very difficult mile, taking two hours. Following the descending rock piles was another steep 2 miles. The going was slow! We had reservations at the hostel and wanted to maximize our time in town. Fortunately, the terrain moderated and we started making better time. The last two miles followed an old road bed and were very easy. We made Pinkham Notch at 5:00pm. Problem: no cell service to call the hostel shuttle. Solution: Trail Talker used her amazing yoging skill and acquired a ride before I could get a call through on the visitor center phone.  We traveled with a nice family in their van the ten miles to Gorham. The hostel is a barn renovated into a hostel. It is very nice, but only one bathroom for ten hikers. The owner assures us there will be three bathrooms, NEXT YEAR! (Should I hike again next year?).
Mr. Pizza served us great steak dinners, then we crashed by 9:00pm. News from the Homefront:Since Jill left for the trail, I have not had to use the washing machine at all! I bought a bottle of Frebreeze and just spray my clothes. First bottle lasted a month, second bottle only lasted two weeks. One bottle per week now.  Clothes

The remainder of the day was relaxing. While White Owl napped, Trail Talker and I attended a Bach Concert I had learned about from a Church member. We were amazed! There were five strings, a pipe organ and a harpsichord, in addition to twelve in the Choir. What talent! The director, who also played either the organ or harpsichord, was definitely having a great time. We enjoyed the concert immensely!

Wildcat Mountain is reputed to be tough. It is! It seems everything is tough in the Whites! A 2000 foot climb took us to four summits on Wildcat. We met section hiker Spunk who plans to thruhike in 2018.  Then, three ladies passed us and White Owl recognized one. Curly had given him Trail Magic in Virginia and had told him she would be in New Hampshire later, look for her. What are the chances they would meet here? 100% ! We all had a nice break together. Curly is 76 and is a Triple Crowner: she hiked the AT in 1992; the PCT in 1996; and the CDT from 2000 to 2009. What an amazing lady! She and her friends then hiked past us again. 
Carter Notch was the next challenge. We got water at the spring and planned to get water again at the next spring. We did not go to Carter Hut. On the way up the next mountain, we learned that there is NO spring! (AWOL needs to correct the guide book.). There is no water for 7 miles and we did not have enough. A south-bounder was kind enough to give us some of his because he could get more at the hut. We have enough for supper but will have to hike 4 miles before breakfast. Hiker midnight is 8:30.

We got up early to get the 6:15 departure time. We are slow, so the actual time was 6:50, after eating a quick breakfast and conserving water. We walked about 50 yards and I said, ""I hear water!"" Sure enough, the stream was running. I don't know why everyone was reporting it as dry. We tanked up and filled our bottles and continued. It took 4 hours to get to the next water, so we would have had a bad morning without the fillup. We climbed two mountains: Mt. Carter and Mt. Moriah. Fog covered us, drizzle started, then a rain shower. We had steep rocks during the rain and we all remembered all the times we said the rocks would be treacherous in rain. We were very careful and had no major falls, just slips and very wet shorts from sliding down the steepest places. After lunch, I met a nice local girl, Mattie, who walked with me for a while and described her hikes in Maine on the AT. She reinforced how hard the Mahoosic Notch will be, which we will face in a few days. Finally, we reached the bottom of the mountain and hiked the last 3.5 miles in under 2 hours.

He will hike on so we said our goodbyes. I hope to see him at Trail Days!  Our shuttle took us back to Andover. Chatterbox greeted us at the Hostel. We last saw him at Silver Fox's house in Manchester Center in August. We missed him by a day in Hanover. It was great to catch up. Boy did he chatter! The chicken pesto pizza from the General Store is fantastic. I can't believe I ate the whole thing! We are back at the cabin for the last night. Hiker midnight is 10:00pm.

However, my friend AT Gracie wanted to meet us. We rescheduled the day. We would meet Gracie at the first road crossing in the morning, go to Rangeley, resupply and hike the final 13 miles on Friday. This eliminates the zero but we would get all the chores done. Gracie met us at 11:30. I had met Gracie at Trail Days in 2015 and we have been friends ever since. She lives in Maine and loves to do trail magic. She drove 3 hours to reach us! Thanks Gracie!!! We had a restful afternoon after a restaurant lunch and shopping.

We slack packed the 13 miles to get back to Rangeley. Finally, there is a break in the terrain. With only a few climbs and descents the hiking was great! At the first shelter, some grey jays were eyeing our snacks. White Owl got the jays to eat out of his hand. I got two great pictures of the birds in flight. Trail Talker was eating a granola bar and a jay swooped down and bit off a piece! Another jay then ate off of my hand! At the campsite, 4 miles later, I took a canoe ride. Later, I came to a group of young men from the Maine Conservation Corps fixing the trail. I complimented them: it is the best trail section I have seen. They dug a huge ditch, built up the trail and then made a rock wall on the side of the ditch. It looks great! The highlight of my day was hiking the last two miles with Peril. He is a thirty year old psychologist from Massachusetts. We had a nice long conversation getting acquainted and sharing our hiking stories. We dined again in Rangeley and Peril joined us. Fremont also joined us. The day ended with a great conversation at dinner.

Our hike today was short, only 3.6 to the Kennebec River then .4 to town. Hikers are required to ride in a canoe across the river because the water can rise rapidly causing dangerous conditions.

Looking closely, I recognized Laurie from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy in Harper's Ferry. She and her husband, Dick, are sectioning in the Wilderness. I ran over and hugged both of them. I met them in 2008 at Trail Days and have seen them many times. Dick noticed my broken hiking pole and offered me his poles. I said I would be okay. We hiked on. At the next road, another section hiker, Old Moose, was packing up his car to leave. He offered us food. Although we had just finished lunch, we ate everything he offered us: bagels with peanut butter, candy bars, fruit bars. We are like we hadn't eaten in a week. Then he gave us his leftover dinners and a breakfast for later. Wow, what Trail Magic! Then Laurie and Dick hiked in. Dick said I had time to think about the poles and I should take his. Okay, I did. He was happy that his poles would go up Katahdin. He took my stick and both poles. We will swap back sometime in the future. I introduced Dick and Laurie to Old Moose, who is a trail maintainer.

We hiked out at 9:30. Right away we met Long John, the trail steward. We had lots of questions about the logistics of camping at the Birches and summiting. He was a wealth of information. We would be the first to sign in to the Birches, so that relieved our worries about where to stay. He also told us about taking the Abol Trail down instead of simply backtracking. We like that idea. 
We hiked on and registered for our shelter site. The hike was fun. We ate lunch by the river. We rock hopped two streams. We met Hot Wheels and Caboose from Indiana, who were very excited to meet us.

The next 1.5 miles was a mild boulder field up, not more difficult than anything the trail has presented so far. Then we hit the BIG CLIMB! It was the hardest part of the trail. Being short does not help! I had to push, pull or crawl up the rocks. The fog had covered the mountain and I am glad that I could not see up. I was terrified enough! It was the steepest I have ever seen. After that, we reached the Tableland, the final leg to Baxter Peak. The last mile was easier.  Poophands was coming down and said, ""I cried like a baby."" That did it! The dam broke and I cried the last quarter mile up to the sign. When I finally stopped crying, we celebrated and got our summit pictures.  I especially wanted a picture of Dick's poles on the sign because he was excited that his poles would be on Katahdin. I couldn't help photobombing one of those pictures. We knew several Thruhikers: Ghost Buster, Pizza, Blade and Bad Apple. It was special summiting with friends. 
The climb down was just as difficult as the ascent. One place, I could not figure my way and a section hiker talked me down. ""Place your right foot here, then you left foot there. Grab the re-bar and let yourself down."" I would not have had the arm strength to do this six months ago! 
We had a time constraint: the shuttle back leaves the ranger station at 4:30. If it took as long to get down as it did to get up, we would miss the shuttle.  After the steepest descent, we were able to increase speed enough to make the shuttle. We are spending the night in Millinocket. It was a great time at the restaurant, seeing our friends. I ate my first ever Maine Lobster. Then I looked up and saw Reptar and Uncle Spider, who I hadn't see since May! I knew they summited a couple of days before, so I was very happy to see them again.

My plan was to rent a car and visit friends, the first one would be Rightlane who lives north of Boston. It was great to see him. He summited 10 days before me. His beard is very long! I arrived at his house at 5:30 pm and we talked for 5 hours! Thursday morning followed with another 5 hours of talking. Hikers have a lot to share. I met his wife and two of his three sons. I also got a nice tour of Newburyport. It was a great visit, and I'm looking forward to Rightlane and Kathy visiting Tim and me, hopefully next summer.
I contacted another hiker, Y-Knot to have lunch on Thursday. He lives 25 miles from Boston. He had driven two hours to see me in the Whites and we missed each other. I was so honored at his effort, I wanted to see him if at all possible. We met when he thru hiked in 2009. He stayed at my house and I saw him again at Trail Days in 2010. We had a fantastic visit catching up. 
My next visit would be with my Aunt Janet near Bear Mountain in New York. But I had an idea about the route I would take. Ever since White Owl had seen the possible meteorite on July 28, I had been scheming to get it. It was on the way to my Aunt's. I studied the guidebook and pinpointed the location, the trail-head out of Cornwall Bridge, CT. I was nervous. Would it still be there? Did I have the right location?  Friday morning, I hiked down the trail. I could see the rock right where White Owl put it on the creek bank! I carried it back to the car. It is heavy! 
My tour continued to Highland Mills, NY. I had a great visit with my Aunt and her husband. They are not able to drive much and they were not able to meet me on the trail, so I went to see them.
Next stop would be White Owl's sister's to ask her to deliver the meteorite. Lettie's home was on the way back to Massachusetts. She was very surprised to see me! She is a great partner in my scheme to give White Owl the rock. We had a super visit before I headed on to Williamstown, MA for the Gathering. The rock is proudly displayed on her mantel until she delivers it.
That ends my tour. The next entry will be The Gathering.

Wingheart was there: I met him on a section hike in 2008, and we have been friends since.  Finally, I saw Hippy Kippy, the CNU professor who inspired my Daughter to hike the Trail, so indirectly he is the reason I hiked. I asked him once if I was the first parent of a student to hike and he said yes.  Finally, I saw Sunset and Miss Janet. She was a great encouragement to me every time I saw her on the Trail. She gave me so much good advice!

Friday evening's program was a tribute to Baltimore Jack. Five of his friends shared many fun stories about Jack. Most were funny. It was a nice memorial. 

Saturday morning a wave of homesickness hit me hard. I just had to get HOME. Since I didn't have a schedule, I was able to book a flight and fly to Richmond by 10:00 pm. The Trail is not over! 
News from Tim, 10/10/16:
Jill made a spur of the moment decision to fly home. I
picked her up in Richmond, got back early this morning.
She got up @3:30 for a bathroom break. She thought she
was still on the trail. She peed on the floor in the corner
and covered it with leaves. Later in the day I heard a
loud noise in the bathroom. She was stomping on the
floor! I asked what for? She said she was checking
for bees before she used the toilet!!!

IWOX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550780,"The wave of homesickness turned out to be an emotional breakdown post hike. Saying goodbye to my hiking friends started the tears and they would not quit. It started when I returned the poles to Dick and told him I was going home. I apologized to Miss Janet for the meltdown. She understood completely and gave me lots of words of encouragement for transitioning back home. AT Gracie was there and we said our goodbyes until next year.
I drove back to Boston and flew to Richmond. Tim picked me up at 10:00 pm. After more tears, I crashed for two hours during the ride home. 
On Sunday, I saw everyone at Smyrna Church. My journal was posted every week before the worship service. Everyone at Church has been a great support for me. 
I wanted to visit Bill and Nancy right away. They had tried to see me in June but we missed each other by minutes. I drove to Harrisonburg and we had a great visit. Then I headed for North Carolina to see my Mom. (I was only home about 14 hours!) 
My Mom is doing great! She lives at Pittsboro Christian Village in North Carolina. She said I didn't need to come right away, but I said it had been almost seven months and I did need to visit now! I stayed with my brother Jeff and nephew Zack; both had hiked with me for two days in April. 
My Mom's visit was super. Tim sent her an 8x10 of my summit picture, so all 100 residents and staff have now seen it, some had already seen it. 
Now to complete my hike I needed to go to the Smokies to hike the 7.9 miles between Clingmans Dome and Newfound Gap. I contacted Lisa Kim and she said come on to her house. Fish is in from Georgia and would like to hike with me. Wow, where else would a twenty-something want to hike with a sixty-something! After a nice visit with Lisa Kim, we hiked south and summited Clingmans. Fish and I talked non-stop the whole way. I found out that Fish and Spicey (my son's friend) hiked 500 miles together and summited together! I am now officially done! 
On the drive home, I called Southpaw and we shared all about our hikes after Delaware Water Gap. I hope to see him at Trail Days next year.
I also called White Owl. His voice sounded so great on the phone, I realized how weak he had sounded before we split up. He had been very sick. I am so glad he recovered! He summited October 8. His daughter hiked part of Katahdin with him. Chatterbox and Troy summited with him. 
While driving home, I got a call from Gormet Dave wanting me to hike an overnight we with his high school class. Yes! We hiked on Saturday the 15th and Sunday the 16th. I had a great time with the class.
An unexpected benefit was meeting South-bounders. The first one greeted me, ""Hi IWOX!"" I did not know him. He is Parson Tripping from upstate New York and he knew me from my journal!  Next came Budget and Buffalo who I remembered passing up north. Along came Denim! We had hiked the same pace for a week in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. He looks for work along the Trail and flipped to Harper's Ferry recently. Seeing him was a great surprise.
A chapter of my life is over. 8 years of planning and 6.5 months of hiking. I plan one more entry. I miss the hiking, but my people even more. What great friends I have!

IWOX,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551127,"After nearly a month off the Trail, I am realizing my life is forever changed. I wake up every morning dreaming about the hike. I want to now express my thanks. 
First, I thank God for the privilege of this experience: I met so many who were not able to complete the Trail. I am blessed. 
I am grateful to my family. My husband Tim managed the home front, my children supported me, my Mom prayed for me every day, my Brothers and Jeff's kids and their families. Thanks to all the rest of the family.  
Cathy Benton: you are the best scribe, and an even better friend! We received so many compliments about this journal, but it was more than that. It has been a connection to keep friendships and make new friends all over the world. Thanks for being my inspiration to write every day.

I loved hiking with you, talking about our lives and our hike, singing, telling jokes. I miss you!
Finally, to all my friends and strangers who read my journal: thank you for your prayers, thoughts and words of encouragement. 
I said many times that no one had more fun than me, they may have had as much fun, but not more. I now say no one was more blessed on their hike.
