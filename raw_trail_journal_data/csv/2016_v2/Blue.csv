Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518909,"I've been saving my first post for years.I had contemplated a thru-hike in 2010, belatedly realizing after much planning and emotional investment that the timing wasn't right. I was left feeling very bummed, thinking I had somehow missed my window. The shakedown hikes I had done convinced me that my dream was real, that I indeed could see myself on the trail for six months....thus making it all the more worse when I called off the hunt.
In 2014, my wife and I took the family to Patagonia. In preparing for that trip, my thru-hiking spark was relit and I quickly realized that 2016, devoid of significant family events, was the perfect year to tackle the AT.
Throughout 2015, I planned. Hunted for the right gear, took the time to get in good shape, figured out a Flip Flop suited me well, and watched the clock on the wall tick all too slowly.
So, finally, 2016 is here, and I can't wait!   On April 24th, I walk into the Len Foote Hike Inn. On April 25th, I'll stand atop Springer, ready for an adventure years in the making.",,Finally....2016!,"Jan 01, Fri",0
Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520387,"I dedicated myself to a 2016 AT thru-hike back in October, 2014. That means I've been planning, buying, training and thinking about this journey with determination for fifteen months now, and I still have three more to go. I read the advice somewhere that you shouldn't give yourself more than 12 months to prepare. I now see how astute that is.I've done very well on a few fronts. To give this body its best chance, I joined Fit Body Providence, a cross-fit gym, and have been faithfully attending classes for a year now. I also signed up to take the SOLO Wilderness First Aid course so that I can help myself and others to avoid major bodily issues. To learn as much from others as I can, I've read just about every thru-hike journal or book out there, subscribed to all the right magazines and websites, attended thru-hike lectures, talked with numerous Patagonia and REI employees, and watched multiple videos and movies. On the gear front, I've glazed over while reading countless websites, bought myself a scale and agonized over ounces, headed out on some really valuable shakedown hikes, and come to find that Walking with Wired, Section Hiker and Appalachian Trials are more relevant, interesting and informative to me now than any other media source ....period. Calendar- and trip planning-wise, I've set aside six months, decided that a flip flop (GA to WV, then ME to WV) makes the most sense for me, planned out in broad strokes my itinerary, and have been able to justify and explain it all to friends and family.Now that I'm three months out, you'd think I'd be all set to go, or at least very excited about getting all this pre-adventure planning behind me. But for some reason, I simply can't bring myself to really think through one incredibly important facet: food. It's been on my to-do list seemingly forever. What will I eat? Do I plan mail drops? If so, what's in them? Where are they sent? What about supplements and vitamins? I've actually succeeded in putting on seven pounds over the last few months, something I feel good about since it appears to be muscle mass and not just fatty bulk, but I know it will come off quickly and I know I need to focus on how I will keep my energy up and some weight on. I really hope that as the calendar turns to February, I will get the urge to tackle this incredibly important element of a successful thru-hike.As any good thru-hiker is excited to do, I will detail my gear selections in my next post.",,Gearing Up,"Jan 29, Fri",0
Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521472,"I'm two months out from starting, and getting very excited. As I said earlier, I've been in planning mode since October, 2014, so ""antsy"" doesn't begin to describe it. I can't wait to have the AT underfoot.My gear list is definitely complete. I don't foresee any more changes. Actually, my shelter, sleep system, pack and kitchen have been solid for awhile. I've been going back and forth on a few clothing choices, and on the various personal items that I'll bring, but that is now all behind me.I'll be carrying Gossamer Gear's Mariposa pack. I'm sleeping in the Zpaks Altaplex single-wall cuben fiber tent, with my Marmot Helium bag, Thermarest NeoAir Xlite pad, and a stuff sack pillow from Hyperlite Mountain Gear. I'll be cooking with Snow Peak's Giga Power stove and Trek 700 titanium pot. I'll be carrying my food in a Zpaks Roll Top Blast food bag.Now that I switched back to Super Feet, after a go with Solo insoles, I'm excited about my shoe choice. The North Face Ultra Fastback shoes, with a set of Super Feet Blue, feel just great. They are stiff enough to not feel everything I step on, but light enough to keep me going. I think, for me, they will be a definite upgrade over just light hikers or trail runners. I'll be wearing Darn Tough socks, and bringing some perfect gear from Patagonia: Cap 4 Hoody, Ultralite Down Hoody, M10 jacket, and Houdini wind shirt. Add trail and camp shirts, a great pair of Brooks Sherpa IV shorts, my Buff and Sierra Designs rain pants, and I'm good to go.When you add in a few other clothes, and personal and safety gear, my base weight (that's before food and water) comes out at 16 pounds. I had hoped to get to 14-15, but I've decided to start out with the 16 pounds and see if I choose to lose a pound or two. I am bringing a Swing Liteflex trekking umbrella, an Anker external battery, and both a Sawyer filter and Aqua Mira, so I know I've got some ""luxury"" items. My sense is that I've been through my gear choices enough now, and I wouldn't be surprised if I keep all that I'm starting out with. Having said that, the trail will be an incredible classroom, and I have no expectation that I've got this all figured out!Alison has thankfully offered to help with my food choices and menu, which is just the best. I've been struggling to focus on it, and she will prove to be invaluable. She'll be sending me mail drops along the way to complement whatever I find in my trail town resupplies. Six months is a long time to be apart, but she is genuinely excited for me and being so helpful. I look forward to her various visits on the trail, and seeing her often in Maine, as I make my way down from Katahdin toward Oquossoc, where she'll spend three weeks in July and August.Alison will be joining me in Peru in early April for a seven-day trek through the Andes to Machu Picchu. That will be a great chance to ""warm up"" for my April 25th AT start, while enjoying a fabulous trip with her.",,What I'm Bringing,"Feb 20, Sat",0
Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523565,"It's March 15th and forty days until I Ieave for Georgia. My to-do list is increasing in length, but the items are much ""smaller"" in nature. All the big decisions have been made, and now it's taking care of all the little details that accompany the commitment to leaving my wife and home behind for six months to walk 2,200 miles while living outside.After much thinking and discussion, I've decided to rely quite heavily on mail drops. I know this may not appeal to those who believe that an overabundance of planning is anathema to the glory of being footloose and fancy-free on the AT. But, acknowledging that I'm tackling this journey at 57, and that I'd like to come back in tolerable condition, I'm opting for health.Alison will be sending me a total of 24 mail drops along the way. Each will contain five days' worth of food, and about a week's worth of supplements. While on the ""flip side"" of my trek (GA to WV), I am mostly picking up the mail drops at inns, hostels and hotels to eliminate the need to live within post office hours. Conversely, on the ""flop-side"" (ME to WV), it appears from AWOL's guide that there aren't too many inns and hotels that accept mail drops, so I'll be using post offices much more.As I mentioned, the driver behind my decision to rely on drops is my health. I would like to eat somewhat well, and also have access to a steady intake of supplements. I'm following Badger's advice and will be taking fish oil, a probiotic, a Whey protein supplement and electrolytes along the way. Alison will send each of these to me. As for food, the thought of overly enjoying a menu gathered up at convenience stores is not my idea of heaven. So, Alison will send along five days' worth of food that will provide a decent foundation. I'll then supplement that foundation of food as needed from local markets and stores.I helped myself to Peanut Eater's AT Planner spreadsheet that Wired posted on her website, WalkingwithWired.com. Once I committed to resupplying through mail drops, this spreadsheet was invaluable to planning it all out. Thanks, Peanut Eater and Wired!I'm quite happy that I've made real progress on thinking through the food angle of this adventure. I am so lucky that Alison is ready, willing, able and happy to support this effort. Without her, it would be much more of a challenge. Having said that, I know that our separation will be very hard on us both. While I'm hiking in New England, I'll see her quite often. But there is three months of hiking before I arrive in Maine....",,Food Planning,"Mar 15, Tue",0
Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524594,"I'm now under a month to go. And I just decided last night to move my start date up by three days. So, I will now begin my trek on Friday, April 22nd, after spending the previous night at the Len Foote Hike Inn.I had to change a few things around to make the new start date work, but everything fell into place nicely.

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528628,"After 18 months of planning and preparing, it is totally crazy to think that I leave in three days. But entirely appropriate. I am ready to go. To discover all those things that I should have thought of, but didn't. I'm ready to take my much-considered plans, and watch the trail toy with them. I am ready to discover things about myself that have been covered up for all these years. On Thursday, I fly to Atlanta, where my nephew, Will, will pick me up and transport me to Amicalola Falls State Park. Once there, I'll register, hike the Approach Trail, and spend the night at the Len Foote Hike Inn. When I arise on Friday, April 22nd (very fittingly, Earth Day!), I will summit Springer Mountain, and officially be off on my Appalachian Trail journey.",,Leaving Shortly!!!,"Apr 18, Mon",0
Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529208,"Riding at 39,000 feet on my way to Georgia, I am struck by my lack of trepidation, fear or sense of impending doom. It simply feels right that I am off on this journey. Sandy, Holly and Katie, our three twenty-somethings, were utterly lovely with their wishes of encouragement and support. It means so much to me that they are proud of me and my Appalachian undertaking. My dearest Alison surprised me with a very special stone that will accompany me along the trail. Composed of stichtite and serpentine, the former is said to promote the power of the heart. It can ease feelings of loneliness, isolation and separation., and offers protection. The latter, serpentine, assists one in connecting with the mind and heart of nature, and helps one find one's natural place within the greater web of life. Need I any more proof that Alison understands, perhaps better than I, the meaning of this journey for me?Before leaving Rhode Island, I was feted by friends and showered with well wishes from all directions. I carry their enthusiasms, and a kazoo (a pitch-perfect gift from one special friend), with me. My nephew, Will, came up big, as he picked me up at the Atlanta airport and drove me to the state park from which most thru-hikers start their endeavor. Along the way, we stopped for stove fuel and picked up a little lunch. Thanks ever so, Will!Since the AT runs from summit (Springer Mountain in GA) to summit (Mt. Katahdin in ME), you must climb up before you officially start the trail. After Will dropped me off at lunchtime at Amicalola Falls State Park, I indeed started up and hiked 6.3 miles to the Len Foote Hike Inn, accessible only on foot, where I am spending the night. After getting up at 3:00 am to catch my flight to Georgia, staying the first night at the Inn is a perfect way to ease into my adventure: a hot shower, a bed, and dinner and breakfast served. The Inn sits four miles from the Springer Mountain summit. On my hike up today, I passed through beautiful rhododendrons and masses of mountain laurel. Growing up on Long Island, our property was covered with laurel, and hiking through it brought back fond memories of wooded paths, sassafras roots, grapevines, and building elaborate forts from sticks, leaves and twine with neighborhood friends. Tomorrow, Earth Day, I summit Springer in the morning, and officially start hiking on the Appalachian Trail.",,Up Towards the AT,"Apr 21, Thu",0
Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529576,"I sit beside Long Creek at 4:30 pm, having pitched my tent, unpacked my things, filtered water and hung my bear bag. Today was a great day. In the morning, I hiked the 4.4 miles from the Len Foote Hike Inn to the summit of Springer Mountain, where I picked up my first white blaze and officially began my AT thru-hike. Up to that point, I was hiking trails that connected to the AT, and they are blue-blazed. Needless to say, after all the planning involved, I was pretty pumped to be finally on the AT.It had started raining about 7:00 pm the night before, and I was quite happy to have then had a roof over my head. When I started out for Springer in the morning, the rain continued. In fact, it rained fairly steadily until 1:00 pm, the only time stopping when I was on the summit. I was fortunate to find a group of hikers already there, and one fellow took the requisite photos of me beside the commemorative plaques that mark the southern terminus of the AT. In the afternoon, I hiked my first 4.7 miles of the AT down to the stream side camp area where I now sit. The hike down was dry and the sun even came out a few times. Right now, it is downright pleasant and 70 degrees. Through the rain, I walked beneath my trekking umbrella, which, thanks to a how-to You Tube video, I rigged to my backpack. Not only did I stay significantly dry, but the rigging system is hands-free, allowing me to hike with my trekking poles. I motored along extremely happily, so glad that I followed the advice of Wired, a Triple Crown thru-hiker (AT, PCT, and CDT), and brought along the umbrella. Before setting out in the morning, I spent some time with Bear, a career military man who had retired in 2013 after 30 years of active and reserve duty. Since then, he has spent the last three years living out of a backpack, traveling around the country, and ""seeing what it was that I had been protecting all those years."" A lovely man, I offered some lightweight gear tips to help him lessen his load. The kicker? Bear is not a trail name; it is his birth name. This part of Georgia is just lovely, with huge rhododendrons, towering pines and cool little ground cover plants that I have never before seen. With some rain, some sun and a rushing brook to fall asleep to, it's been a wonderful way to spend Earth Day 2016.","Springer Mountain

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529579,"Today was just a pleasure to be hiking. Sunny and bit windy, I had two nice climbs and moved right along. 
I have purposely been suppressing my miles, trying to stay right around ten a day for this first week. Carrying almost 30 pounds and climbing mountains is not something you rush into and I'm trying to allow my body some decent time to get used to the burden. Each of the next two days will be 8-9 milers. After that, I will increase the mileage. 
While the leaves are out, they are just in their early stages, leaving one with unfettered views from the trail into the forests. Soon, the leaves will multiply and the woods will appear dense, but, for now, I love the openness of it all. 
Tonight, I am at Gooch Mountain Shelter, where I am tenting on quite a slope because all the good sites were taken. I don't mind, though, because the hikers that have joined me here have been entertaining. Two of them are thru-hikers and both plan on big mileage days tomorrow. I wonder if I'll see them again.","Long Creek

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529847,"Today was a good day. I was a little apprehensive to again hike a relatively short distance, but everything turned out just fine. I took my time getting started in the morning, totally understandable given the lack of sleep I got from my sleeping bag sliding down to the bottom of my tent every chance it got. By the time I broke camp, it was 9:30 am. Then, within the first half-hour, my pack decided to start to squeak with every step. In addition, my ""kitchen"" (mug, stove and fuel) started rattling, again with every step. With nature's bounty all around, nothing is worse than bouncing down the trail and having your pack produce artificial noise. I stopped to successfully fix the problems (a little duck tape goes a long way!), and proceeded to enjoy another sun-filled day. The weather for the past two days has been heavenly.I hiked into my first two bits of trail magic today. After crossing a road at Woody Gap, I found two retired couples from Ohio handing out water and cookies. They come down to Georgia every year to the same spot, seeking out thru-hikers to talk to and ply with refreshments. At the same location, I found a public toilet that I had not expected, but needed badly. Granted, it wasn't the cleanest, but it was serviced somewhat regularly, and it was a welcome change from trail privies or the woods. In previous times, I would have opted for anything but; in hiker mode, it was a palace. It's amazing how your perspective changes once you're carrying all you own. Tonight's tenting spot, Lance Creek, is incredible. The creek provided a nice spot to wash myself (badly needed) and rinse my hiking garb. The tent areas are flat as a pancake and I don't foresee any sliding problems. Tomorrow, I climb to the highest point on Georgia's section of the AT, the summit of Blood Mountain, just under 4,500 feet. After the climb, I walk down into Neel's Gap, where I pick up a few things to resupply.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529848,"As you can see in the photo, the Loch Ness Monster is alive and well and swimming right in the middle of the AT! 
Georgia is treating me to a run of incredible weather! I climbed 4,457-foot Blood Mountain today, and found it to be just a great hike. There had been some pre-climb chatter about the ascent's steepness, but it really wasn't bad at all. In fact, I loved the hike up. At the summit stands a shelter constructed out of stone in 1934 by the CCC, and it is just beautiful. After chatting with a few folks at top, I descended to Neel's Gap, picked up a bit of food for the next three days, and grabbed a shower, paying $5. Well worth it at any price!I ended up hiking farther than first anticipated when the group of hikers I've been seeing each night decided to push onto Baggs Creek Gap. This was an excellent decision, as the campsite sits on a ridge, and the wind will be blowing a lullaby all night. Prior to turning in to write my journal and hopefully fall asleep, we chatted around a campfire, my first fire of my AT trek. With good company and wind blowing steadily, it was magical.","Lance Creek

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530075,"After hiking 47 miles in 5 days (if you include the Approach Trail), and thus meeting my goal of averaging no more than 10 miles a day for the better part of the first week, I was ready for more miles. By hiking 14.5 miles today, I've set myself up to arrive in Hiawassee, Georgia, on Thursday around noon, instead of late in the day. I had originally planned a ""zero"" in Hiawassee on Friday -- taking a day off without any miles hiked -- but by getting to town early in the day on Thursday, I can accomplish instead that afternoon all that I had wanted on my planned Friday zero: pick up my mail drop from Alison, do some other resupply, make some phone calls, check some email and do laundry. Thus, the result of my 14.5 miles today is that I now have the choice of hiking on Friday, or taking a zero....we'll see how I feel. There's only one small catch: I need to follow today's miles with something like 12 or 13 tomorrow to allow my early arrival Thursday, and tomorrow's terrain will be the hardest yet I've seen on the AT. Today's 14.5 miles was on the easy side until the last two miles. By then, I was tired and had to climb up to a ridge where Blue Mountain Shelter sits. Thus far, I have chosen not to stay in any of the shelters, preferring to camp in my tent in the adjacent camping areas. Why, then, hike to shelters if you're not going to stay in them? Because shelters generally have good water sources (the reason the shelters are located where they are!). Having said that, the water source here at Blue Mountain Shelter was basically a trickle and made the daily water chore more onerous than usual. (I'll explain how one gets potable water in a future post.)I'm here tonight with Rambler, Two Rock and Boney, three of the hikers with whom I've shared a number of campsites. Rambler is a thru-hiker; Two Rock and Boney are hiking only the eighty Georgia miles. Each has a trail name - a moniker that either they chose for themselves or was given to them by other hikers. To date, I simply hike as Don, preferring to await that moment when a fellow hiker has a bolt of insight and bestows upon me an incredibly apt trail name. (It's possible.). But more probable, I make some rookie mistake and someone is there to catch it, thus earning me a less flattering trail name. I'll hope for the former.....Today, I developed my first two blisters, not from heel or toes rubbing against my shoes, but rather from the pounding: I have a small blister on the ball of each foot. I've prepared a doughnut of Moleskin to apply to each spot in the morning, but don't have high hopes that they will be effective against the multiple thousand-foot ascents and descents that Georgia has in store for me tomorrow. Maybe that zero on Friday will be a welcome necessity.","Baggs Creek Gap
",Blue Mountain Shelter,"Apr 26, Tue",14.50
Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530181,"Today's roller coaster was a great follow-on to yesterday's hike. Starting from Blue Mountain Shelter, the trail descended right away for 1,000 feet to Unicoi Gap, then immediately climbed for 1,000 feet to the 4,017 foot summit of Rocky Mountain, then dropped for 700 feet and then ascended for 1,000 feet to the 4,430 foot summit of Tray Mountain. The whole day more or less went that way, and when I made camp at Sassafras Gap, I had put in a strenuous 12.8 miles. The weather again was divine, and the day passed quickly. As a pleasant surprise, Boney and Two Rock appeared in camp a bit after me. It's been great getting to know these two Gainesville, Florida men, and I will miss them when their hike concludes at the Georgia/North Carolina border. As I expected, the blister on my right foot didn't survive the climbs and popped in the late morning. No matter, however, since I was going to have to pop it myself at some point. I threw some Neosporin and a band-aid on it and was good to go. As long as it doesn't get infected, it will remain an insignificant reminder of just what I'm putting my feet through. Quite interestingly, there is no muscle in my body that's disagreeing yet with the hike. I awake every morning raring to go. While I can't point to any one reason, I'm thinking that the supplements I'm taking, combined with the work I put in at Fit Body, are paying off. A close cousin to a zero is a near-o, or a day with just a few miles hiked. Tomorrow, with hiking just the six miles to Dick's Creek Gap, I will pull my first near-o. From this gap, I will grab a hotel shuttle bus and travel the eleven miles to Hiawassee, where I have a hotel room waiting for Thursday night. My plans for Friday are still up in the air, although I expect I'll leave Hiawassee and put in at least some miles in the afternoon. Alison has shipped me a summer-weight sleeping bag and I pick it up in Hiawassee. The bag I am now carrying, one good down to 20 degrees, is simply too hot, even when I open it up and just use it as a blanket. Once I get the lighter weight bag, I will ship my heavier bag to myself at Fontana Dam, NC, where the Great Smokies National Park begins. When I arrive at Fontana Dam around May 7th, I will have to decide which bag to carry through the Great Smokies. Much to the surprise of many folks, the highest point on the AT is the Smokies' Clingmans Dome, which is several hundred feet higher than NH's Mount Washington. Clearly, temperatures could be cold. Fortunately, there is a week of hiking between Hiawassee and Fontana Dam, so I'll have some time to gauge the lighter bag's warmth. At this point, I'm thinking that I'll be fine in the Smokies with the lighter bag, as I'm carrying a silk liner which adds to a bag's warmth, and I can wear a down jacket, long underwear and down booties to bed in case of a cold snap. I'm looking forward to my town day tomorrow. Hiawassee is very hiker-friendly, and there's something completely charming about trail towns on the AT.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530389,"I finished the 6.3 miles to Dick's Creek Gap by 10:30 am, and waited for the shuttle bus from the hotel to pick me up. While waiting, I met Grady, a fellow thru-hiker, and we decided to share a room in town. I have a feeling that he will soon outpace me on the trail, and I won't see much of him, until I flip-flop and we pass each other, he coming north, and I moving south. Tomorrow is the last day on the trail for Boney and Two Rock. We had lunch and dinner together in Hiawassee, traded contact info, and shared a few more laughs. I wish them both the best of luck in their future endeavors. I have decided to hike tomorrow, feeling that I had a good afternoon and evening in Hiawassee, and wanting to leave on a high. I have a full food bag, and my lighter sleeping bag in hand. I worked on my feet a bit, grabbed a shower, shaved and did laundry. Feeling somewhat like a new man, I'm off to the woods again. After hitting the Post Office in the morning, I'll try to catch a ride to the trailhead and resume my journey to North Carolina. With any luck, I'll cross the border tomorrow.","Sassafras Gap

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530607,"Today was a reminder of how tough the AT is. For the most part of my 11.8 mile hike, it was, ""Whatever you do, one foot in front of the other.""Several things conspired to make the day a trial. First, from Dick's Creek Gap up to Couthouse Bald, there was 2,003 feet of elevation gain, topping out at the bald's summit of 4,708 feet. The terrain was simply tough. Second, I was thrown off my game by my hotel stay in Hiawassee last night. When I awoke in town this morning, I didn't do my usual pre-hike hydration routine, nor did I eat my usual breakfast. Third, I received my first resupply food box from home and thus left Hiawassee with ten pounds of food, quite a heavy load. Fourth, a spring I was counting on for water around noon time was dry, causing me to hike another 2.3 miles of hard trail before I could get my water bottles filled. Finally, today I said good-bye to Two Rock and Boney at the GA/NC border (photo), and hiked alone for the toughest part of the day. In the end, a couple of good things did result. I crossed the border into North Carolina, and bid Georgia good-bye. (My time in Georgia was truly stupendous: the weather was gorgeous, the people I met most welcoming, and the countryside drop-dead beautiful.). The other good thing was that when I was indeed tested, I just kept walking despite it all. The one lesson I learned the hard way today is that you don't skimp on water to avoid carrying weight. Each liter weighs 2.2 pounds, and I usually have two liters with me. But because I was carrying ten pounds of new food, I chose to only carry one liter of water, expecting to refill often when I passed running water sources. But, I started out the day under-hydrated, and then couldn't refill on the trail as often as I needed. Thus, I spent most of the day thirsty, and tuckered out. Before I chalk up today to experience, I want to thank Two Rock and Boney for indoctrinating me to the AT and for providing me with some seriously great company for the first 79 miles of my journey. I will miss your camaraderie. I am at Muskrat Creek Shelter tonight with people I have not met before. There's a pretty sizeable group of twenty-somethings, and a smattering of other ages. While I like to hike alone during the day, it's nice to see familiar faces in camp at night, just as I had with Two Rock and Boney. We'll see what develops in the days to come. Tomorrow I climb over 5,000 feet for the first time. And, I hear that we may run into some rain both on Saturday and Sunday. More challenges!Note: I have been journaling every night. I upload to the website right away if I have service. So please know I am doing my best to update daily, but I am at the mercy of the Gods of Verizon.","Dick's Creek Gap (and then Hiawassee)

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530707,"Last night, I met two thru-hikers at Muskrat Creek, FloMo and Dirty Girl, the former, a woman, the latter, a man. We ended up together on the trail today, alternately passing, and then being passed by, the other. At one bend, I was told that they had my trail name. It was inevitable. You can't meet me or pass me on the trail and not notice. Except for my shoes, everything I wear on the trail or in camp is blue. So, it didn't surprise me at all when FloMo and Dirty Girl simply exclaimed, ""You're Blue Man.""While I might have liked something a bit more far-reaching into my soul, I can't argue with Blue Man. And, as FloMo said, ""everyone will remember your name or know it's you if you haven't met yet."" So, I have a trail name, and I like its simplicity. After an incredible stretch of weather, it has come crashing to a halt. Sitting now at camp at 4,528 feet, I am being treated to a real mountain thunderstorm, replete with strong winds and heavy, heavy rain. My tent is performing admirably, but I did just avert a disaster by noticing that the wind had blown one external flap inside of an internal one, allowing water to drip inside. Had I not been journaling, and instead sleeping, I would have awoken to a serious amount of water in my tent. Let's hope I'm high and dry in the morning.Despite the fact that I summited Standing Indian Mountain, at 5,435 feet, the highest mountain I have climbed in the east, today's hiking was the easiest of the trail thus far. The ascents were long, moderate grades, and the trail didn't dip into any extreme gaps. After yesterday's tribulations, I'm thankful for today's uneventfulness.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530886,"Before I get to today's events, let's back up for a second. Why am I thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail? For a couple of reasons.First, in my 57 years, there are two life-defining achievements that I can point to with pride and a sense of accomplishment: my marriage with Alison, and my helping to raise three wonderful young adults. To those, I would like to add a third: a thru-hike of the 2,189 mile AT. The trail speaks to me. The simplicity of its concept, the beauty of its journey, the love of its hiker community, the challenge of its completion. If I am able to complete the hike, I will be forever proud of something I did, something that had true meaning to me as an accomplishment. When all in this life is said and done, I will be able to say to myself with pride, ""Good for you. That was worthwhile."" And the second reason: I would like to be lighter in this life. I believe my path to ""lighter"" lies through the principles of simplicity, living closer to nature, living in community, and being at peace with myself and where I am in life. I know that the Appalachian Trail speaks to each of these and puts me on my intended path. I am now ten days into my adventure, and I am content. After last night's torrential rains which began in the late afternoon and continued unabated until 5:00 am this morning, it was a pleasure to awake to clearing skies. Packing up a wet tent is never fun, but at least it wasn't raining when I broke camp. Today's hiking was, for the most part, relatively easy. I say for the most part because the last quarter of mile up to the summit of the 5,250 foot Albert Mountain was as tough as anything I've seen in the White Mountains or Maine. Seemingly vertical in spots, I had to toss my hiking poles up ahead of me to allow use of two hands to scramble. Once at top, the 360 degree view from the fire tower was stunning. It just so happens that the base of the fire tower sits at the 100 mile mark on the AT. So, another milestone passed. The rest of today's hike was uneventful. But the weather forecast for both tonight and tomorrow night is as bad as last night's, so FloMo, Dirty Girl and I are taking the opportunity to duck into Franklin, NC, and avoid one night of rain by spending tonight at the Gooder Grove AT Hostel. I plan to catch a ride back to the trail tomorrow morning, probably in time to hike in the rain.","Carter Gap Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531244,"Today was a good day. Last night, it indeed rained and I was happy to be at the Gooder Grove AT Hostel. Its owner, Colin, is a great host. I grabbed the 9:00 am Town of Franklin shuttle back to Rock Gap this morning, and by the time I started hiking, it was already 10:00 am. I had my designs on the Wayah Bald Shelter, but I knew the 14.7 miles to reach it were going to be tough, as the trail summits Wayah Bald, elevation 5,342 feet, before getting to the shelter. Besides, I was getting a late start, so I didn't hold out much hope. It would take some real effort, and, if I were to get to the shelter, I would need to log my longest day yet mileage-wise. Anyway, the good night's sleep at the hostel must have helped as I felt great and cruised along, including on the rather long uphill climb to Wayah Bald. While I hiked, thunder bellowed all around me, but, amazingly, it never rained where I was. At the Wayah Bald summit stands a stone tower with incredible views, so there was a good pay-off for the hard work. I walked into the Wayah Bald Shelter campground at 5:00 pm, having hiked 14.7 miles in seven hours. It is now 8:30 pm and it is pouring. But I'm warm and dry in my tent. A good day, indeed. Today's photo is of blooming and flowering trees at 5,000 feet. Spring is just arriving. But down below, in the valleys and gaps, the vibrancy of the greens is breathtaking. Knowing intellectually that elevation has an impact on the timing of Spring, and then seeing it in action, are two totally different animals! Tonight might be a good time to update the injury report. Since I last shared that I was dealing with blisters, FloMo relayed what a ranger had suggested to her: loosen the shoe laces, and not just a little, but so much so that your foot sloshes around in your shoe. This advice sounded a bit kooky to me, as well as dangerous. If you allow your foot to have that much play in your shoe, aren't you inviting even more blisters? And how can one walk if their shoes are wobbling all over the place?Despite my skepticism, I had nothing to lose and was out of ideas myself. So, loosen I did. And the results were immediate! My left foot is no longer a concern, and my right is well on its way to becoming an afterthought. Once you deal with one problem, you move on down the list, and when you are a thru-hiker, there is always a list. I have been getting a burning pain in the middle of my back after hiking one or two hours each day. I have willed my way through it, but with each day it gets a little bit harder to ignore. I now realize that I must do something about my pack, so I have decided to accelerate my hiking to be able to get to NOC Outfitters before they close for the evening on Wednesday. Before I leave you for the night, a few additional words. I have heard from quite a few of you that you are enjoying my posts. Thanks so much for the words of encouragement, and for taking the time to follow me on my journey. Knowing that I have readers makes all the difference!","Rock Gap

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531261,"In yesterday's entry, I contrasted the newly-flowering trees at 5,000 feet to the vibrancy of the greens down in the gaps. Here's a photo from down below. Tonight, I am camped on a river, listening to a cricket choir so loud that sleep will be difficult. I am about a mile off the trail, having pitched my tent a ways from the Nantahala Outdoor Center, where I will go tomorrow morning and pick up my new pack. Switching packs is not an easy decision; I know just where everything goes in my current one, and can tell if I've left something behind just by sense. There is no doubt that I need to change my pack. The real question is will the next one be any better?My current pack, the Gossamer Gear Mariposa, is an ultralight pack and has very little structure to it. It has a wonderful set of seven external pockets, and each is stuffed with those things that I use all the time so that I don't need to go rummage for them inside the pack's main compartment. The Mariposa weighs under two pounds, its chief benefit. But to get the weight savings, you give up structure and strength, as well as the myriad ways one can adjust other packs. As a result, I find it impossible to get it to sit right. So, in the morning, I pick up a new Granite Gear pack, heavier but hopefully better fitted and more comfortable. I hope it works out!To get to NOC Outfitters by 4:00 pm, I left Wayah Bald Shelter at 7:30 am and set a spirited pace. It had rained quite heavily the night before, and insisted on continuing for much of the morning. My trekking umbrella again came in handy, but the footing was precarious to say the least. How I remained upright for all of the day's hike I know not. At times I felt like I was walking on the back of a greased pig. The last two days have left me a bit worn out. After I pick up my pack in the morning, I have a furious climb to undertake, moving from 1,700 feet to over 5,000. I would like to put in 13 miles tomorrow and another 15 on Thursday. That would put me at Fontana Dam a day earlier than I recently planned, and allow me to rest up for two days before starting out for the Great Smokies National Park, the site of the highest AT elevations. As Week 2 draws to a rapid close, I am reminded of how special the AT is. It truly is a national treasure, a gift to all those who choose to enjoy its splendors. I feel privileged to be out here, listening to the hum of nature, and sharing the experience with others who hear it, too.","Wayah Bald Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531594,"Today was all about managing the swings in my emotions and mindset. This has long been my challenge in life. Sometimes, I am successful. Other times, I fail, blazingly. I camped beside a river last night, which, while pleasing for a while, quickly turned sour as colder weather set in. You may remember that I sent my warmer sleeping bag ahead to Fontana Dam, and was left with what is purported to be a 40 degree bag. Well, temperatures probably dipped into the high 40s, I was cold all night, and the wind off the river didn't help. Needless to say, I broke camp tired and cold. Off I went to NOC Outfitters for my new pack, the Granite Gear Lutsen 45. Very kindly, Tom (perhaps the owner?) was opening the store that morning and suggested I come by at 8:15, well in advance of their public opening at 9:00. This would get me on the trail sooner and allow me ample time to transfer all my gear from my old Gossamer Gear Mariposa pack to the new, which is actually more difficult than it sounds. On my old pack, I had rigged various add-on systems to secure my umbrella, my phone, and my camp shoes, all of which had to be moved to my new one. In addition, I had to figure out where to put every item of gear, factoring in how often I needed to access each. Throwing everything into the main compartment is a recipe for frustration, as it causes you to fully open the pack each time, thus taking unnecessary time and sometimes putting at risk those things you need to keep dry. There is absolutely a science to packing a backpack well, and I had it all figured out on my old pack. I didn't necessarily want to do it for my new pack. Change is often tough. Anyway, I surged through it, and then was gifted the offer of having the store's Shipping and Receiving Department take care of shipping my old pack home. Thank you, Tom, Kirby and Jason, for all of your help. Your kindness is very much appreciated!So, with new pack firmly in place (and feeling good), I took to the trail. Given my lack of sleep and the terrain, it was tough going. I was on my way up to Cheoah Bald, elevation 5,062 feet, from Nantahala Gorge. It was an eight mile climb in total, and felt every foot of eighty miles. And how, you ask, was your new pack, Blue Man?Not to bore you with my particulars, but I have a 19-inch torso, measured from my C7 vertebra to the crest of my hip bone. This 19 inches was confirmed by both the NOC Outfitters staff and the Gossamer Gear representative when I bought my original AT pack. But I've thought for some time now that while I may measure 19 inches, I carry a pack ""smaller"". Even though I felt this, I went along with the staff's 19-inch pronouncement, and left the store with my new pack duly adjusted to that measurement. (While my first pack could not have its torso length adjusted, my new Granite Gear Lutsen 45 can.)The upshot of all this is that my back hurt almost immediately upon departure, and, as the eight-mile climb went on, it was all I could do to trick myself into believing I liked my new pack. Now, I actually do love the design and features of my new pack. It's simply a better pack than my Mariposa in swallowing up my gear and having it accessible. Also, the sturdiness is a definite bonus, and it has some bells and whistles that just make it a really cool pack. But it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing....and thus far on that day's hike, it was failing me miserably. I spent the day somewhat deflated but soldiered on, up and over Cheoah Bald and down into Stecoah Gap. Once there, I was picked up by Donna, the owner of A Cabin in the Woods, where I was spending the night. Temperatures were forecasted to drop into the 30s, rain was again expected, and with that light sleeping bag of mine, they would have had to thaw me out of it in the morning. Donna and her ""loft"" ended up being a godsend (photo). I had a little bungalow to myself, with rafters to hang and dry out my tent and sleeping bag, and two beds, one for my gear and one for me. It has rained every day for the past four, either at night or during the day, or both. It was nice to again have a roof over head. Things were thus looking up....a bit. With a cheerier outlook, I took to thinking about my pack. I liked the fact that I could adjust the hip belt and the torso pad, and hoped I could land on some combination of settings to allow my back some relief. So, again questioning my 19-inch torso, I adjusted the pack to 18 inches and went to bed, falling asleep to another night of rainfall.","NOC

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531595,"I awoke in my bungalow this morning to 41 degrees and a forecast for more rain. The 14-mile hike to Fontana Dam looked easy: an early, steep climb up Jacob's Ladder, but then some minor climbs and a long downhill to the dam, authorized in 1941 to supply hydroelectric power to the war effort. Donna, my bungalow's owner, took me back out to the trailhead and said good-bye. She was a bright ray on yet another overcast day. By 10:30, the rain had started in earnest, and temperatures didn't climb out of the forties for the remainder of the day. Now, given the weather the last five days, and the issues I've been having with my pack, you might be thinking that the last journal entry of my trek must be right around the corner. Sure, I made one bad decision (sending my heavy bag ahead), the weather since Georgia has been a better fit for the Scots than the North Carolinians, and my pack has been a bit of a drag. But despite this confluence of issues, I continue to have the time of my life. Besides, adversity is good. It makes the mundane meaningful. (When I saw my $20 a night bungalow, I just about wet myself I was so excited!)I chose my gear wisely for this trip. In the rain and cold today, I had on the finest of AT couture: long underwear under a pair of running shorts, my hiking shirt, a fleece, a windshirt, gloves and hat. With my trekking umbrella fully deployed, I was dry and warm. Okay, but, how, you ask, was your new pack, Blue Man? The short answer: better. I think the move to 18 inches helped, and I more frequently adjusted the shoulder straps so that I wasn't in one position for too long. I also noticed that what remained of the pain moved around the middle of my back a bit, discounting one theory I had -- that I had an out-of-place rib that a chiropractor could take care of. In the end, I had my best day on the trail. My back pain subsided considerably, I loved hiking in the coolness and rain, I arrived in one piece at Fontana Dam after fourteen days and 165 miles of challenging hiking, AND I have two zeroes in front of me to rest up, fix some gear, and eat plenty of non-dehydrated food. Today, I hiked with 20 pounds in my pack, as my food bag was completely empty by day's end. Once at Fontana, I picked up both my food resupply box from Alison, and retrieved my heavy sleeping bag. Thus, when I hit the trail again, I will be carrying 30 pounds, a 50% increase from today. Will my back hurt? We'll see. On Sunday, I start the seventy miles of trail through Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the most visited of the country's national park system and home to the AT's highest elevations. And receiver of snow last night. This six-day Smokies segment will provide a great test for my new pack. At its completion, I will be able to render a verdict of success or failure. Stay tuned.","Stecoah Gap

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531761,"After 14 days in a row of hiking on the AT, I took my first zero today at Fontana Dam. I did my laundry, had lunch with Nathan, Blood Man and Clay, made some phone calls, took a bath, and generally rested and relaxed.With little happening trail-wise, I thought I would take this opportunity to talk about hydration: how much I'm drinking, how one gets clean water, and the systems and strategy I employ. Thus far, I am drinking about 4.5 liters of water a day. (A liter is just about the same amount as a quart.) I start off each morning, before I begin to hike, by drinking one liter at breakfast: I drink a cup mixed with my whey protein powder, a cup with my granola and dehydrated milk, and then drink two additional cups. Once on the trail, I drink a liter in the morning, a liter at lunch, and a liter in the afternoon. I try to limit my water intake after 4:00 pm to just what I need to cook with (usually two cups to rehydrate my dinner), the desired result being that I get up only a couple of times during the night. That means I'm quite thirsty when I wake up, but it makes it easy to get down my allocated liter of water in the morning. Even though the streams and springs are fairly pristine and flow quickly, the twin impacts of animal and human waste make it inadvisable to drink untreated or unfiltered water. As a result, every thru-hiker carries some sort of water treatment. There are two basic kinds: a filter-based method, and a chemical additive method. My water system consists of two one-liter Smart Water bottles, a 2 liter Platypus collapsible water bottle, a 0.10 micron Sawyer filter, and the Aqua Mira chemical treatment system. Thus, I carry both a filter and chemical treatment system to ensure clean water, the only area in which I can be accused of carrying duplicative systems. When I reach camp in the late afternoon, both of my Smart Water bottles are usually dry or close to dry. At that point, I fill up my 2 liter Platy bottle (my ""dirty water"" bottle), screw on my Sawyer water filter, and fill each of my Smart Water bottles with clean water. It takes the dirty water about 5 minutes to pass through the filter and fill up a one liter bottle. After both liter bottles are full, I refill the Platy bottle with untreated water, and add Aqua Mira to it. Aqua Mira is a chemical system that takes about 20 minutes to purify the water. So, I now have two Smart Water bottles of clean, Sawyer-filtered water, and I have the 2 liter Platy water in process of being cleaned with Aqua Mira. I rehydrate my dinner with a half liter, and am careful not to drink much at all. In the morning, I drink my allocated liter. Then, with the water in the Platy bottle now clean because of the Aqua Mira I added the night before, I fill up the Smart Water bottles to the top, and am ready to go hike. The beauty of using Aqua Mira in addition to my Sawyer filter is that I don't have to take the time to filter any water in the morning -- only refill my water bottles with the Aqua Mira-ed Platy water. This gets me on the trail with less morning hassle. Since I leave for the trail each morning with two full Smart water bottles' worth of water, and plan on drinking three liters during the day, I only need to stop once and filter a Smart Water bottle's worth of water from a stream or spring using my Sawyer filter. Then, as I mentioned before, I typically get to a campsite with Smart Water bottles either newly dry, or with just a little water left. Because I use Smart Water bottles that sit in elastic sleeves on the outside of my pack, I can easily tell how much water I have left. A hiker who uses a bladder that sits inside his pack to hold clean water has to open that pack to see what's left, and bladders have known to periodically leak. But, the benefit to using a bladder system is that you can suck water through a tube from the bladder and do so while you hike without stopping. Acknowledging this advantage over water bottles (which you typically have to stop and pull out of the external sleeves on your pack to drink), I have rigged up a tube system that screws onto my Smart Water bottles. Thus, I get the benefit of being able to drink water through a tube on the go and monitor how much water I have remaining without having to open my pack. So, with my hydration system, I can drink continuously, not waste time filtering in the morning, have a backup system with me in case something did go wrong, and not have, in my opinion, the complicating factor of a hydration bladder in my backpack. You now know more than you probably ever wanted to about drinking water on the trail. With a second zero scheduled tomorrow at Fontana Dam, I will take the time then to write a post on the food and supplements that I carry. Tomorrow, I also meet Barbara for lunch. Now living in Tennessee, she and I worked closely together for a number of years, and I haven't seen her since we moved to Providence in 2007. It should be a wonderful lunch!","Fontana Village

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531896,"Happy Mother's Day, Mom! Today I took my second zero at Fontana Dam. I am totally itchy to get back on the trail, but the two-day rest did my body good. I've packed quite a few meals in during my stay, repaired some gear, and generally rested. The weather for the Smokies looks quite nice for the next three days, so I'm looking forward to the climb up tomorrow. Following on yesterday's water discussion (which I admit may have been a little too hiker-nerdy for most), I thought I'd talk about food tonight. On average, a thru-hiker burns between 4,000 and 6,000 calories a day. There simply is no easy way to carry enough food with you to fully replenish what you burn. So, a thru-hiker generally is calorie-deficient while hiking, and then arrives in trail towns, ready to eat, eat and do more eating. My goal is to eat 3,500 calories a day on the trail, while carrying about 2 pounds of food a day. For a five-day supply, then, I'll be carrying a little more than 10 pounds of food. When that is combined with two liters of water (4.4 pounds), and my fully-loaded pack of gear at 15 pounds, I will carry at most a 30 pound pack, and that will be whittled down to 20 pounds as I consume the food. While others do carry heavier packs, one improves their chances of finishing all 2,189 miles by carrying as little weight as possible, and 30 pounds is considered a good target weight. Doing the math, if I want to consume 3,500 calories a day and carry 2 pounds of food a day, then each ounce, on average, must provide about 110 calories (3,500 cal/32 oz = 110 cal/oz). As I mentioned earlier, Alison is sending me 5 days' worth of food each week, which I supplement with trail-bought food for the other two days of the week. Here's what she is sending me:Breakfast: Granola and powdered milkLunch: Peanut butter and tortillas, plus olive oilDinner: a collection of dehydrated meals, mostly from Alpine Aire, that provide about 600 calories per mealSnacks 1 and 3: Cliff BarsSnacks 2 and 4: Almonds, dried apricots and yoghurt-covered raisins This standard course of food will provide me with 3,500 calories. I then take four supplements to aid me in various ways: fish oil for joints, a probiotic for digestive health, electrolytes to replace minerals sweated out, and a whey powder to provide badly-needed protein and calories. Thus far, I have had to force myself to eat all that on a daily basis. To date, the ""hiker hunger"" that every thru-hiker suffers through -- when you are hungry all the time -- has not hit me yet. But it's only a matter of time. While I adore the granola breakfast and the Alpine Aire dinners, I can tell already that we'll have to get creative about lunch. Even with the 3,500 calories a day, I'm quite sure that I've already lost a number of pounds in just these two weeks. I hope to arrest any further slide, but know it will be a real challenge. I am just going to have to eat like I never have every chance I get in trail towns and when I come across trail magic. Onward to the Smokies!","Fontana Village

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532457,"Arrrrrrggghhhh! Man, am I mad at myself!My new pack, now a week old, is somewhat smaller than my old, so I had to get creative to make sure all my gear fit. Everything ultimately did, except that there was no logical place to attach the pouch that held my phone. So, I temporarily rigged it to my shoulder strap, knowing that it was a stopgap measure for sure. When I got to Fontana, I made a list of everything I needed to do to my gear while I zeroed. But I forgot that I needed to fashion a long term solution for my phone pouch. Since it didn't make the list, I didn't focus on it. When this morning came around, and I was ready to get back on the trail after my zeroes, I realized that I hadn't figured out a better system for my phone. So, in my haste to rejoin the trail, I simply slipped my pack's sternum strap through a loop on the pouch. The sternum strap runs from one shoulder strap to the other and keeps those two straps from falling off your shoulders. The only problem is that you must unbuckle the sternum strap when you want to remove your pack from your back. I wanted to get an early start hiking but found out the shuttle to the trailhead didn't start running until 8:30 am. Since it was only 7:30, I decided to walk the two miles to the trailhead instead. After getting perhaps 1/2 mile down the road, two thru-hikers stopped their car and asked if I wanted a ride. Bingo! I unbuckled my pack, including the sternum strap, swung it off my shoulder and into the backseat. I hopped in, introduced myself as Blue Man, missed their exact names because they said them at the same time, and found out that the young man and woman were off the trail for a few days as she had a doctor's appointment on Tuesday in Asheville. They had rented a car and were on their way to do some trail magic for thru-hikers at the Fontana Shelter. We arrived at the trailhead several minutes later, and I thanked them for the lift and hopped out. After they pulled away, I quickly realized that I didn't have my phone or its pouch. Uh oh. I immediately took stock and weighed my alternatives. I thought there was an excellent chance that the phone was in the back seat of the car. I had to find that car. I thought I knew where they would be doing the trail magic, and had two options: I could head to the road and try to hitch, or I could begin hiking the 2 miles to the Fontana Shelter, where I expected to find them. Since it was Sunday morning before 8:00 am, I thought the hitching idea was probably futile. So, I hit the trail. Hard. Within 45 minutes, I was at the shelter, where I quickly learned that the young couple had just left ten minutes earlier. Damn. Dejected, I called the shuttle that, by then, was finally running. I had the driver take me back to spot where the couple picked me up and I checked up and down the shoulder, just to make sure the phone and its pouch didn't end up on the side of the road when I took my pack off. I didn't see anything. At this point, I was beginning to freak out a bit. How was I ever going to find that couple in their rental car? I had the shuttle take me back to my hotel, where I called Alison and related my predicament. We agreed that it was looking hopeless, and the best thing was for me to get on the trail. Alison was meeting me in Hot Springs in seven days, and we could visit the Verizon store and pick up a new phone. In the meantime, though, I would be hiking through the Smokies, without a phone, a camera, an ability to text, or the ability to upload my journal. I was not happy. At this point, I saw FloMo in the lobby and told her the situation. Her boyfriend had come to visit for the weekend, and he had a car. I asked if we could drive around town, looking for the rental car. They agreed, and off we went, looking for a needle in a haystack. No such luck. Now quite down, I asked to be dropped at the trailhead, and I started hiking the 12.4 miles to Mollie's Ridge Shelter, the AT's first shelter in the Smokies. I was not in a good place. At some point, it occurred to me that maybe one of the thru-hikers on the trail might know the young couple in the rental car, so I kept an eye out. (Thru-hikers are pretty easy to pick out.....just follow the scent, known as hiker stank.) After talking with a number of strike-outs, I came across Taser. Thinking that my driver's name might have had ""spoon"" in it, and thinking that the girl's name might have begun with an S, I asked Taser if he knew Spoon. He looked at me somewhat benignly, and said, ""You mean Big Spoon?"" Sure! That works! I asked if he had a girl with him. ""Yup, her name is Silly."" For the second time that day, Bingo! By any chance, Taser, do you have Big Spoon's number? ""Well, no, but I have Silly's."" Incredible! Can you call her? ""Sorry, bro, no service here."" Okay, please give me her number and when I get to Mollie's Ridge Shelter, I'll see if anyone has service and I'll text her. So, away I went with Silly's phone number and some renewed hope. When I arrived at the shelter around 4:30 pm, I immediately borrowed a cellphone and texted Silly. She responded quite quickly, saying they were in the process of returning the rental car and would look. A few minutes later....""Sorry, we scoured the car, but no phone."" Dead end. Dejected. For an hour or two, I sat, reeling from having hope, and then having it dashed. At that point, FloMo came bouncing down the trail, calling my name, saying I won't believe it. ""Dirty Girl has your phone!"" What? How? Where? Huh?It ends up that two guys had found my phone on the side of the road, evidently where I got picked up, and they were taking it to the General Store, which serves more or less as the center of hiker activity in Fontana. Dirty Girl, taking a zero that day, was at the General Store when the two guys drove up. First offering Dirty Girl a beer (at 10:30 am), they said they had just found a cellphone. Dirty Girl saw the black pouch in which the phone sat, recognized it as mine, and asked to see the phone. When the two guys pulled out an iPhone in a blue protective case, Dirty Girl knew it was mine. He then texted FloMo, who was on her way to Mollie's Ridge Shelter, and had service at the time. I couldn't believe my luck! All I had to do was wait for Dirty Girl to hike up the next day. FloMo tried to text Dirty Girl back, telling him that I was going to wait for him at the shelter until he arrived the next day. But, she couldn't get service at the shelter and Dirty Girl never got the message. Still, my luck had changed, and I would have my phone back the next day. I went to sleep, relieved.","Fontana Marina

I wanted to get in at least six miles, maybe even twelve, that day, so I wouldn't have to kill myself to get to Hot Springs on Sunday to meet Alison and Holly. While I waited, I thought through why the cellphone meant so much to me. Sure, not being able to take pictures of the Smokies would be a drag, but that wasn't it. Feeling out of touch without the ability to text? Definitely a bummer, but I could borrow a cellphone to text when needed and tell Alison I was fine. After a bit of thought, it became obvious. I have so enjoyed journaling, capturing my (mis)adventures, and then sharing it all with family and friends. I have been quite moved with the feedback I have received, and the number of people who are following me. Without the ability to journal and upload every day or two, I was being robbed of what has become a true pleasure, and I felt I was letting my readers down. With my feelings thus figured out, I went back to waiting. 1:00...2:00....3:00. I had decided that if he didn't appear by 4:00, I would have to spend a second night at Mollie's, and 4:00 came and went. Okay, maybe I can leave at 4:30 and make the next shelter comfortably. Where could he be? When 6:00 hit, I knew I had to make a decision. I decided I had to leave in the morning, phone in hand or not . I simply had to hike after traveling a total of 12 miles in four days. Hiking would be my medicine. I wrote out a message for Dirty Girl in the shelter's trail register, asking him to contact Alison to arrange, at some point, a hand-off of the phone. I then texted Alison and Holly on a borrowed phone that I was leaving in the morning and would be out of touch for the next eight days, but would see them in Hot Springs. I then tried to gird myself for hiking without my phone. Not an easy day. I climbed into my sleeping bag around 8:00, after the sun set. Everyone in the shelter was well aware of my predicament, and probably quite tired of my moping around. All of a sudden, a fellow thru-hiker announced a headlamp bounding down the trail toward the shelter. My hopes lifted, most likely dangerously, again. Unbelievably, it was Dirty Girl, and he had my phone. I hugged him, thanked him profusely and never bothered to ask why he left Fontana so late. He decided to night hike to the next shelter six miles away, and I considered going with him for a second, but ruled it out. I didn't need to take that risk. I had my phone, and something Alison would tell the children when they were young came to mind. ""Today was a difficult day. Tomorrow will be better.""","Mollie's Ridge Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532725,"Finally hiking again, I took out my frustrations of the last 48 hours on the trail. With Alison arriving in Hot Springs on Sunday, I needed to hike 96 miles in six days to meet her, an average of 16 miles a day. All hikers, when traveling within Great Smoky Mountains National Park, are required to stay in shelters when there is room. This helps to limit the disturbance caused by tents. Each shelter typically holds between 12 and 16 people, and when you plan your day's hike, you must take into account not only the terrain and water sources, but also the location of the shelters. My 96-mile hike would necessitate two 19-mile days, two 16- and two 13-milers. I figured it would be best to get one of the 19s out of the way while I was fresh. I started hiking at 7:00 am, and the day was perfect. There was a stiff breeze blowing, and I was quite comfortable in a hiking shirt and light shell. With such ideal conditions, I ripped off twelve miles in the morning. Before lunch, I came across an extremely large wild turkey on the trail who paid me little mind. He finally moved off, allowing me to pass quite close by. By the afternoon, I was straddling the North Carolina/Tennessee border, as the ridge I was hiking forms the border between the two states. At times, I was in Tennessee, at others North Carolina. I imagine I had a foot in each at times, too. Thus, I've now hiked in three of the fourteen states that host the AT. About mid-afternoon, as I approached a crest in the trail, I flushed an animal down in the woods off the trail, and I caught a glimpse of my first bear. He scurried farther downhill, and I was able just to see his Winnie the Pooh rump. As I finished my 19 miles, I arrived at Double Spring Gap Shelter, and was pleasantly surprised. The water source was close by and free-flowing, the privy was relatively new and quite clean, and I was joined at the shelter by Pastor Trace and his band of five Auburn students. We had shared Mollie's Ridge Shelter on my first night there, and I really enjoyed their company. Throughout the day, my views of the Smokies seemed to be cursed. Since none of the mountains in North Carolina or Tennessee, despite some exceeding 6,000 feet, are above treeline, unfettered views are hard to come by. In addition, there seems to be a perpetual mist or haze that covers the ridges, and I understand this is where the Smokies got their name. Even though brilliant blue skies and alpine summits were missing, the mountains stretched forever, putting off a regal aire, and making me glad to be there.","Mollie's Ridge Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532729,"At 6:00 am, the skies opened and a set of thunderstorms passed through the mountains. I was thrilled to be in the shelter. As I started to hike, I quickly passed above 5,500 feet on my way to Clingmans Dome, at 6,667 feet, the highest point on the AT. With the early morning's rain still fresh in the air, it was quite misty. And, for the first time since I began the AT, I moved into a coniferous forest. Replete with mosses, the forest floor reminded me so much of Maine. This was quite a change from the forests and woods that I had encountered to date. The smells were familiar, with balsam hanging in the air, and the trail took on a flavor that I hadn't seen. When I got to Clingmans Dome, the tower that adorns the summit was fog-encrusted, and the views non-existent. I quickly headed down as rain started in. Lasting only an hour, the showers had little impact on me beneath my trekking umbrella. At some point in the afternoon, I passed the 200-mile mark for the hike, meaning that I had less than 2,000 more to go. Hmmmmm. In the afternoon, I hiked from Newfound Gap up to Icewater Spring Shelter, gaining over 1,000 of elevation in the process. The sun had come out, the trail gracefully hugged the ridge, and a fresh breeze was blowing. Still among fir and spruce, the trail was intoxicating. It was, to me, the best stretch of hiking I had done on the AT. Tonight, I'm staying with quite a crowd at Icewater Spring Shelter. Sitting at 5,935 feet, the shelter offers incredible views of the surrounding Smokies. The sun was out when I arrived, and the gathering of hikers was out enjoying the warm rays. The setting was idyllic, a lovely way to end yet another great day of hiking.","Double Spring Gap Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532944,"I awoke at 4:30 am to a group of hikers preparing for a pre-dawn departure, and to the sound of thunder. Wanting to hike 19.8 miles to Cosby Knob Shelter, I was hoping for some decent weather. Rain was not what I had in mind. The thunder continued for the next hour, but when dawn finally broke, we were greeted with a lovely sunrise. Any hint of rain was long gone. I was hiking by 7:10 am, and shortly stopped at a dramatic outcropping named Charlie's Bunion. The view over the mountains was stupendous, and, with the sun newly risen, it was as clear as I had seen it in the Smokies. The day was off to a wonderful start. Wearing just a short sleeve shirt, (blue, of course), I began hiking along the North Carolina/Tennessee border. For the next fifteen miles, I walked this delicious ridge, in places only four feet wide before dropping off sharply on both sides to each of the two states. The sun stayed with me all morning, and I enjoyed one of the finest stretches of hiking I have ever had. The ridge rolled along between 5,300 and 6,300 feet, presenting views on one side of North Carolina, and on the other of Tennessee. Gently gaining and losing elevation, the trail's moderate slope made for comfortable hiking. After posting twelve miles before lunch, I noticed a darkening sky, and the weather took a significant turn. By 2:00, the wind had come up and it started to rain. For the remainder of the day, my trekking umbrella was deployed and water fell harmlessly about me. Upon arriving at Cosby Knob Shelter, Chloe, the ridge runner employed by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, greeted me and asked if I'd like one of the last spots in the shelter that night. With rain still haunting the late afternoon, I enthusiastically accepted. While I still prefer to be in my tent, the shelter was looking better and better as the rain increased in intensity. As I sat down to a dinner of Chicken Gumbo, the sky let loose with one last deluge, and I couldn't have been happier than to be under the shelter's protection.","Icewater Spring Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533056,"Yesterday, I was riding the ridge, touching 6,300 feet in elevation. Today, before lunch, I bottom out at 1,373 feet. This exemplifies the greatest physical challenge to completing the entirety of the AT: the constant climbing and descending that tests one's stamina, leg strength and ability of the knees to withstand the pounding, particularly when going downhill. In the full course of its 2,189 miles, the AT registers total elevation gain of nearly 500,000 feet. Of course,it also shows nearly 500,000 feet of total elevation loss, since the net gain, from Springer Mountain's elevation of 3,780 feet to Mt. Katahdin's 5,269 feet, is roughly just 1,500 feet. In between, on the journey from one to the other of these two peaks, a thru-hiker will climb the equivalent of Mt. Everest sixteen times. He will also descend the equivalent of Mt. Everest sixteen times. It is a fact of AT life: a hiker fights gamely to gain elevation, only to give it back, sometimes as soon as the next bend. In a nod to thru-hikers, Sisyphus would stand in salute of the task. Yesterday, when I suggested in my post that ""the sky let loose with one last deluge"" in the early evening, I was dead wrong: that deluge was only the opening act. It poured, really poured, all night long. When I awoke at 5:30 am, I gave myself until 6:30 to get out of my sleeping bag, in the hope that it would stop raining. When this deadline passed with no change, I got up and readied myself for a long day. Starting out around 8:00 am, the rain actually showed some sign of letting up, as the skies brightened a bit and the birds started singing. By 9:00 am, all that was left was a drizzle, and the monumental amounts of water cascading down the trail from 18 hours of non-stop rain. As I descended down off the ridge to Davenport Gap, I walked in torrents of water that were anxious to find the the quickest way off of the mountains. With the water came prodigious amounts of mud, exceptionally gooey mud. In fact, the mud was so deep, gooey and slippery, that you appreciated the chance to once again walk in the torrents of water to clean your shoes. Towards the end of the morning, I completed the last of the AT's 71 miles that are hosted by the Great Smoky Mountain National Forest. I enjoyed my time immensely in the park, even with the seemingly omnipresent rain. When it counted most, however, as I traveled the fifteen miles of ridge from Icewater Spring Shelter to Mt. Guyot, I was presented with bountiful sunshine. It might not have lasted long, but it will last forever in my memory. By the end of today, I had hiked seventy miles in the past four days, a fairly torrid pace, necessary because of the one and a half days I sat still in the penalty box, awaiting my cellphone predicament to be resolved. With Alison, Holly, and now Katie, too, arriving in Hot Springs on Sunday, I thought it might be poor form if I were not there to join them. Hence, my push. With the seventy miles now behind me, I have just 26 more to cover in two days, allowing for a somewhat relaxed pace. Still, I am quite looking forward to two days' worth of rest in Hot Springs and the opportunity to visit with my family. On my way to Groundhog Creek Shelter this afternoon, I didn't see any of the namesake rodents, but did see my second bear. He was loping up the trail in front of me, evidently not wanting to get into it with me. He was extremely healthy-looking and beautiful. Now that I'm out of the Smokies and its enforced shelter policy, I am free to sleep once again in my tent. This makes me one very happy camper.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533315,"Today, I cried for the first time on the Appalachian Trail. At Fontana Dam last Saturday, I picked up my most recent food drop from the Post Office. As usual, Alison had sent me five days' worth of food. It would last me from Sunday through this past Thursday. My plan was to resupply on Friday at Standing Bear Farm, a hostel that, in addition to having a bunk room, sells hiker food from its on-site store, has a shower room, offers hikers the use of a kitchen for food preparation, and runs a shuttle service. It provides a significant service to the hiker community. When I got to Standing Bear on Friday, a large group of hikers had gathered to share a shuttle van that afternoon to Damascus, Virginia, for Trail Days, an annual thru-hiker festival weekend. As a result, the pantry was a little bare when I went to shop. I did the best I could, but was not terribly happy at my menu for the next two days. I wasn't too concerned, though; before you know it, I would be in Hot Springs on Sunday, enjoying robust meals with Alison, Holly and Katie. I could certainly make it through two days. My 17.6 mile hike on Friday was a bit tough, especially the section after Standing Bear Farm, where I ended the day with a five-mile climb, gaining 2,500 feet, to summit Snowbird Mountain. I was really beginning to feel the pace I had put on over the past four days. That night, I prepared my first Standing Bear Farm-purchased meal: Ramen noodles with an added packet of tuna. Not awful, but not my idea of a badly-needed nutritional meal at the end of a long day. This morning, I followed my usual whey protein drink with a Carnation Instant Breakfast, always good if you're in a pinch for time, but not a recommended ""meal"" before a day of thru-hiking. With my stomach less than normally filled, I headed off for a 14.5 mile hike. For the first time on my AT adventure, my legs felt heavy from the get-go. Sure, they've been tired at the end of a day, but never at the beginning, like today. And, to make me even unhappier, I didn't have my normal on-trail snacks of Cliff Bars and my homespun concoction of dried apricots, almonds and yoghurt-covered raisins that I adore. Instead, I had two small, chewy granola bars and a store-bought trail mix composed of mostly chocolate. As the morning progressed, I was getting a bit anxious. I wasn't moving at my normal pace, my trail legs were AWOL, and I envisioned a repeat of all this on Sunday. I really didn't want to pull into Hot Springs, running on fumes and in a sour mood. Aside from a well-placed public toilet, and my returned cellphone, I had come across Trail Magic exactly once in the prior 22 days on the trail. With the ""hiker bubble"" at least four weeks ahead of me, most people interested in performing trail magic had already come and gone. In March, in particular, so many thru-hikers start their journeys that the campsites and shelters are packed with upwards of 75 hikers a night. This is commonly called the ""hiker bubble"" and lasts between four and six weeks in March and early April. And if you were looking to be a ""Trail Angel"" and surprise thru-hikers by grilling hamburgers, offering pizza and beer, or any number of countless ways of providing ""trail magic"", you would do it during the hiker bubble. (My definition of trail magic: an act of kindness or good fortune bestowed unexpectedly on a hiker by the ""trail"", usually by Trail Angels.)So, with my late April start of the AT expressly designed to miss the hiker bubble, I had no thoughts of receiving any trail magic. But, frankly, up until today, I didn't really feel the need for it. I was eating well, and had been in town enough to feel well fed. Besides, when my cellphone was returned to me in an amazing show of hiker community cooperation, I probably used up every trail magic chit to which I was entitled for the entire 2,189 mile journey. So, coming out of Brown Gap this morning before heading into yet another climb, this one to the summit of Max Patch, I was totally unprepared for what I was seeing at 11:45 am. There, just off State Road 1182, was a parked SUV with its lift gate open, having already deposited a folding table, gas grill, cooler, assorted food, and three young men into the parking area adjacent to the AT. The three young men were tending to two hikers, one of whom, Fantasy Feet, I had met before. The other was new to me. One of the three Angels was grilling brats, another slicing watermelon, and the third handing out one's choice of beer or Powerade. I was astonished. I could not believe my luck. This was the kind of trail magic you just can't explain, and I really needed it. It was simply perfect. Field of Dreams perfect. I was moved, emotional. The young men, Flounder, Captain Pants and Hoot, were childhood friends from Greenville, South Carolina, and had driven up for the day to perform trail magic. They had thru-hiked together in 2015, and simply wanted to engage again in the magic that is the AT. One, Captain Pants, graduated in 2013 from a smallish college hard on the banks of the Connecticut River halfway up the state of New Hampshire, and wore its hooded sweatshirt. As I heartily enjoyed two brats, two slices of watermelon, a Powerade and a package of cookies, I took in their effortlessly offered company. Their easy way with each other was endearing. Their bond of life-long friendship had been borne during their formative years, and they clearly kept fond memories of their thru-hike together. With my fair share of the food gone and my spirits lifted immensely, I asked for a few photos. The happiness and camaraderie evident in the photo above you can't fake. From left to right, that's Hoot, Blue, Captain Pants and Flounder. These three young men made not only my day, but quickly became a cherished memory that will help fuel me for the remainder of my 2,189 miles. With deep appreciation and gratitude, thank you, guys. One more note. Before saying good-bye to my hosts, I turned to the sole remaining hiker there, the one I had not yet met. He looked to be in his late fifties, had his long hair parted in the middle, and wore glasses. I asked him his name. His reply, ""Wildman.""Back on Long Island when I was growing up, my dearest neighborhood friend during my primary school years was Jackson Main. We called him Wildman as we all got older. He was gentle and kind and carried himself with a boyish enthusiasm that he held on to with all his might. He succumbed to cancer at age 49. Jackson, our Wildman, had his hair long and parted in the middle, framing the glasses he wore. He would have turned 59 this summer. Just how many Trail Angels were at work out there? Today, I cried tears of joy on the Appalachian Trail.","Groundhog Creek Shelter

We had arranged to meet in town, but they patiently waited for my arrival at trail's end instead. Needless to say, it was a wonderful greeting. We plan to spend some time in Asheville, visit the Biltmore, soak in the Hot Springs mineral baths, and take every opportunity to eat. It will be a wonderful two zeroes. I'll be back at it on the trail on Wednesday. I took all of Saturday's post to talk about Trail Angels and trail magic, and didn't say anything about Max Patch (photo). So, let me say a few words here. Max Patch, a ""bald"" in North Carolina that I crossed over Saturday right after my trail magic experience with Flounder, Hoot and Captain Pants, was incredibly beautiful. A bald is simply a mountain that, in its past, had its summit cleared, typically for grazing but perhaps for other agricultural purposes. Most of the balds have since reforested, with small areas sometimes kept open. But Max Patch (a homophone for the original name ""Mack's Patch"") has been maintained as a true bald, with grass covering its entire summit. It is a stunning sight, with incredible views of the surrounding mountains. The portion of the AT down off of Max Patch and all the way into Hot Springs is no less beautiful, and I imagine a visit to Max Patch makes an absolutely gorgeous day hike. As for Sunday's hike, it started after an incredibly cold night, easily in the mid-thirties at my campsite at 4,100 feet. I know it wasn't colder only because my water didn't freeze. The wind was blowing a bit when I woke up, and I put on almost every piece of clothing I had. By the time I had walked the 11.7 miles into Hot Springs, it had warmed into the 60s in town, but the forest remained cool all the way down the trail. The hike was easy, and I felt like a horse turned home....anxious to get to Hot Springs and see my family. The town of Hot Springs is just the best! Love it! We will be enjoying ourselves here, as it reminds us of Rangeley, Maine, an AT trail town near and dear to all of our hearts.","Catpen Gap

I contemplated not posting an entry tonight, but decided that's just not right: my journey deserves to be accurately captured. So, here goes...Our stay in Hot Springs was just the best. Great vibe, very friendly folks and everything you could hope for in a small town. After a wonderful night and big breakfast at Mountain Magnolia Inn (highly recommended!), I had to say good-bye to Alison, Holly and Katie. It was very difficult. I so enjoyed seeing them and didn't want to leave. At 9:30 am, Alison walked me to the edge of town to see me off. I'm not sure when I'll see her again....but it can't be soon enough. The trail out of Hot Springs presented me with a decent climb of 2,200 feet. Since I picked up a food resupply box in town, I was hiking with my pack at its heaviest, a common affliction when climbing out of a trail town. To add insult to injury, the hills immediately outside Hot Springs through which the AT passes had suffered major forest fires just weeks ago, and I hiked all day among the charred results. So, to sum it all up, it wasn't my finest day on the trail, but I did complete the eleven miles that I had planned to hike. Just after I finished pitching my tent, a storm passed through and I was happy to duck inside and stay dry. The campsite and shelter tonight are quite full, with many familiar faces. That does take some of the sting out of the day. I did have the pleasure of seeing a young woman, AJ, on the trail today. She was in my SOLO Wilderness First Aid course that I took in Foxboro in mid-April. I knew she and her boyfriend, Colin, planned to leave Springer Mountain on April 29th, one week after me, and I wondered if I would see them. They are hiking up to Damascus, Virginia.

Just about dawn, it stopped, so I was able to break camp with relative ease. As I hiked through the day, it again rained on and off and I broke out my umbrella several different times. More so than the intermittent rain, though, the fog defined the day, lending an eerie feeling to the landscape. I camped at 3,538 feet last night, and the trail today first took me down to 2,223 feet, and then up to 4,750 feet. My mood in the early morning matched the trail's descent, as I kept returning in my mind to Hot Springs and Alison, Holly and Katie, rather than enjoying the hiking at hand. As the morning progressed, however, and I started the climb back up out of the gap, I seemed to respond positively to the ascent. Sadness, sitting jockey since I left Hot Springs, loosened her rein and my gaze lifted from my feet and instead set on the trail up ahead. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, I began to shift my attention from what I left behind in Hot Springs...love, familiarity, companionship...to consider what lay ahead as the trail moved through Erwin and Hampton and Damascus.About mid-afternoon, I began to hike a ridge that featured Big Firescald Knob (photo). This is a new section of the AT, as volunteers of the Carolina Mountain Club recently finished constructing a trail over Big Firescald. Previously, the AT has skirted the summit. The new trail is something to behold, hugging the rocky and exposed ridge. Unfortunately, the aforementioned fog eliminated any chance of a view, but I still had fun wending my way through tight spaces and jumping from rocky step to rocky step. As I pulled into Jerry's Cabin Shelter at day's end, I passed the 300 mile mark for my AT journey. Yes, a long way to go, but I choose to think of how far I've already come.At bedtime, it is again raining, with more forecast for Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

I packed up yet again a wet tent and hit the trail shortly after 8:00 am. The rain expected for today didn't appear until 5:00 pm, so I was able to hike both morning and afternoon without my umbrella.Unfortunately, the trail was again more a mud bath than footpath. Footing was extremely precarious, purchase hard to find, so I walked quite tentatively. At one point, I literally could not stand up without the aid of my hiking poles.Again, fog ruled the day. As it wafted through the forest, I felt like Hansel from the fairy tale, but instead of breadcrumbs, I was following white blazes. There is something very comforting about the blazes. I may hike by myself, but I do not walk alone. The AT is there to show me my direction, and I follow in the footsteps of others. I put in a good 15 miles before stopping for the day. Upon arriving at the Hogback Ridge Shelter at 4:30, I unfurled my wet tent to let it dry, and headed off to do my water chores. Within 15 minutes, the skies had opened and, despite my sprinting back, my tent got more wet than it was when I started drying it.

The only difference from yesterday? It rained while I hiked. I left the shelter with the hope of putting in a big day. If I could hike 17 miles, then I'd only have 10 miles to Erwin, TN, the next day. With that short a distance to town, I could arrive by noon, grab a hotel room, do my laundry, dry out my gear, get lunch and dinner...and be back on the trail the next day. Good plan, but, first, I had to hike a big day today. And the conditions were not in my favor. It spent a good deal of the morning raining, but I was able to move right along, my goal of seventeen miles pushing me forward. Around lunchtime, the trail climbed back over 5,000 feet for the first time since the Smokies, and I in turn summited three balds. For the first, Big Bald, 5,516 feet high, the fog was thick and moved in waves with the blowing wind. There was little visibility. As I descended from its summit and began to climb the second, Big Stamp, at 5,399 feet, something unexpected happened: the sun began to peak through and patches of blue sky appeared. Thinking it might be my only chance, I broke for lunch earlier than usual and spread out my tent, hoping the sun and wind would collude to dry it out. My luck held, and within 20 minutes, my dry tent was ready to pack. Just as I stowed it away, the fog began to envelope Big Stamp, and I was fortunate to experience nature's show. In today's photo, I captured two fog banks, one from the left, the other from the right, in the process of colliding over Big Stamp. With the sun still illuminating the hills, the photo captures a special moment for me and is one of my favorites I have taken on my journey. Seconds after the photo, the whole bald was shrouded in fog, just as I earlier found Big Bald. Once the fog hit, I hiked down off of Big Stamp and headed for Little Bald, at 5,220 feet. By the time I summited, around 1:30, the rain started pouring....a real cats and dogs affair. But instead of focusing on how hard it was raining, I reveled in the fact that somehow I was granted 20 or 30 minutes of beauty on Big Stamp. Despite the rain and slippery conditions, I continued to make excellent time and arrived at Spivey Gap, Mile 16 for the day, at 4:00 pm. With my spirits high from Big Stamp and my legs spurring me on, I decided to hike another five miles to No Business Shelter, arriving at 6:00 pm.

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534536,"After hiking just 6.2 miles this morning, I'm in my hotel room in Erwin, TN, dry, fed and quite content. With my gear drying all around me, food resupply box next to my pack, clothes laundered, and a new toothbrush procured, life is good!A friend asked for a photo of the inside of a shelter, thinking some of you might be interested. The shelter shown here is from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and so is a bit grander than your average one. Packs are hung up out front to get them off the ground and out of the way, and there are two levels of sleeping platforms. (Most shelters only have one level.) I think this shelter was designed to sleep 14, but on bad nights, people would move closer together and it could hold 20 or so. There's a woman behind the Smart Water bottle for scale. In a shelter this size, you would be able to sit up if you're on the bottom platform, and I prefer it there because it's easier to get in and out. Most people sleep with their heads facing out; I actually like sleeping the other way, with my head against the back wall. This shelter has a section of plastic roof built in so that some natural light penetrates. Given the rain's recent track record, I have begun to appreciate shelters more and more, and no longer avoid them at all costs. I still prefer my tent, but on a rainy night, a shelter is a great place to be!Now, let's see what the injury report says. First, my feet are in great shape. No blisters, no real issues. May this continue!Next, I think I can now declare my new pack to be a solid, stand-up triple. While I no longer suffer pain, there is some discomfort, mostly, strangely, when I'm hiking on the flatter parts of the trail. When I'm climbing or descending, I can easily control any discomfort through periodically tightening or loosening the shoulder straps. But when the terrain is flat, I seem to have a bit more of a problem. I also find that the heavier the load, the greater a chance for discomfort. This isn't rocket science; the first two days after resupply are the toughest. Still, compared to my previous pack, my new one is much, much better, and I'm happy with it. Finally, my knees seem to be thus far taking the pounding quite well. Once in a while, I'll hear a little bit from one or the other, but nothing even remotely concerning. I have yet to take any anti-inflammatory, including ibuprofen, so popular on the AT that hikers call it Vitamin I. So endeth my report.","No Business Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534762,"With a change in the weather forecasted for the next three days, I left Erwin looking forward to some sunshine. The day did not disappoint. Conditions were perfect - still cool but plenty of blue sky - for my 3,500 foot climb to the summit of Unaka Mountain. Overnight, trail conditions firmed up considerably, and I took advantage of the better weather to hike 17.1 miles to the Cherry Gap Shelter, summiting Unaka along the way. In the end, it was a rather enjoyable day -- and one without any drama -- that I hope repeats itself. I seem to have caught up with a new group of thru-hikers. While there are a few faces I recognize, most staying at this shelter tonight are new to me. I continue to post relatively high mileage days and I feel like I have entered a different phase in my hike. When I originally planned out my adventure, I gave myself six months to finish, as I heard that thru-hikers generally take between 4.5 and 7 months. Assuming I would zero about once a week during the 180-day trek, I planned for 155 days hiking and 25 days off. With the AT now measuring 2,189 miles, that means I would need to average 14 miles a day on those days I hiked. Already, 14-mile days seem somewhat short to me. I am trying to put in 15 to 17 miles each day, and succeeding. The terrain I am encountering now is demanding; as I move into Virginia, it will ease up a bit. About one-quarter of the AT is in Virginia, and once I arrive there on June 1, it'll take me about five weeks to finish its 550 miles. I have found that I am averaging just over 2 mph when I am hiking. Once you include stops for filtering water, bathroom breaks and lunch, I average just under 2 mph. This has held relatively constant over the past couple of weeks, and I can now count on it. At that pace, I can hike 16-17 miles in about nine hours. So, if I start hiking each morning at 7:30, I can finish my nine-hour day by 4:30 pm, giving me plenty of time to then pitch my tent, hang my food (to keep it away from bears), filter my water, cook dinner, clean up, and journal. In the end, what matters most in posting miles is not so much my pace, but rather making sure I put in the hours...just like most things in life! If I succeed in being on the trail for nine hours each day, then the miles will melt away beneath my feet.","Erwin, TN

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534983,"Under cloudless skies, today I climbed the last 6,000 foot mountain on the AT until Mt. Washington in New Hampshire. After a spirited twelve miles and a well-deserved lunch, I started the five-mile hike up Roan Mountain, gaining 2,000 feet in the process. Roan Mountain stands over 6,200 feet and sits on the Tennessee/North Carolina border. Once I got above 5,500 feet or so, the smell of balsam filled the air, and the trail took on Maine-like characteristics. The fun thing about Roan is that its shelter, just down from the summit, is the highest of any on the AT. I am in my tent at 6,193 feet. Because of the elevation and wind, the shelter and surrounding tent sites are known to be particularly cold. But, with the recent change in weather, I am here on perhaps one of the most benign and beautiful evenings. I imagine it will drop into the forties tonight, but that's positively tropical based on what I hear from the hiker stories. Despite sitting so high, I do not have a view. Trees abound. Still, it's a lovely spot on a lovely evening, and I'm grateful. On my hike this morning, I passed through an old apple orchard (photo). Every once in a while, one comes upon these areas that are still mowed and maintained as meadow or grassland. With the ever-present forests close at hand, these oases stand out and make a real impression. In fact, I ate lunch yesterday in such a field, enjoying a bit of sun, as it from time to time succeeded in shunting aside the clouds. Each night, I now see ten to twenty hikers at whatever shelter or campground I'm staying. Most are heading north, and, at least during the weekdays, most are thru-hikers. Interestingly, though, when I'm on the trail, I hardly see anyone heading in my same direction. It seems we all set out at different times in the morning and maintain our spacing, so that we don't see each other until we gather at the next shelter to spend the night. As a result, you can sometimes believe that you are the only human being around for miles. It's a pause-inducing sensation. If the birds are quiet and the wind gentle enough, silence rules.","Cherry Gap Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535056,"Under perfect conditions, I hiked the length of the Roan Highlands in the Cherokee-Pisgah National Forest. Starting at Roan High Knob (6,193 feet), and continuing through to Hump Mountain (5,587 feet), I crossed a number of exquisite balds in weather that made up for the less than ideal conditions I saw earlier in the Smokies. These treeless balds, brilliant green, their grasses obeying the winds, are the perfect counterpoints to the dark and somewhat foreboding spruce-fir forest that I found at Roan High Knob. In particular, Hump Mountain, marking the end of highlands, was spectacular. I saved my lunch stop for its summit and luxuriated in the sun, the views and what I took to be the ever-present breezes. As I dropped out of the highlands, I crossed from North Carolina for the last time. I now have 72 miles to go in Tennessee, and then move into Virginia. Since leaving Erwin, TN, I have logged 51 miles in three days, and my legs reminded me of that fact all afternoon. Fortunately, I have planned a somewhat easier next three days, expecting to hike only 35 miles and allow my body some rest. Tonight, I have pitched my tent at Mountain Harbor Hostel, renown on the AT for its breakfasts. Since the hostel was full tonight, with an additional number of hikers staying in tents, the owners decided to serve dinner. I cannot begin to describe how delicious the barbecued chicken and ribs, baked beans, creamed corn, salads and desserts were. With my appetite now reaching typical thru-hiker levels, I ate, for me, prodigious amounts, and loved every mouthful. With Mountain Harbor's breakfasts routinely voted the best on the entire AT, I have decided to chuck my 7:30 am hiking start out the window tomorrow and instead sit down with my fellow hikers for an 8:00 am feast. Sometimes, you just need to be a little flexible!","Roan High Knob Shelter

With that, I only have nine miles to hike tomorrow before arriving at Black Bear, a creek side inn with cabins, where I pick up a resupply box from Alison and have a bunk reserved in their bunkhouse. With an early start, I'll be there by noon or so, and plan to spend Friday afternoon resting and relaxing. Today's hike was incredibly enjoyable. Spending the whole day between 2,700 and 3,700 feet, there were no major climbs or descents. The trail gently rolled along and I was all too happy to follow. Equal parts of the day were spent hiking along the Elk River, rounding in and out of rhododendron groves, skirting maintained fields, and crossing stream after stream. With balds, knobs and ridges rightly deserving the rich praise given them, landscapes at lower elevations sometimes go underappreciated. Not so from this hiker. Today, I again came upon several unexpected fields hemmed in by hardwood forests. The sudden openness, inviting the sun to penetrate, yielded the welcome aroma of wildflowers and blooming bushes. It's hard to aptly describe the impact of these hidden fields and grasslands. Not only does their innate beauty shine, but, because of them, the surrounding forest seems to stand taller and the transitional zone between field and forest, so important as habitat, prospers. The ""absence"" inherent in a field makes everything around it ""more"". Today was a little taste of what the trail has in store for me. There is a whole lot of beauty to see below the five- and six-thousand footers of North Carolina, Tennessee, New Hampshire and Maine, and I look forward to it all.","US 19 (Roan Mtn., TN)

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535384,"Since leaving Erwin, TN, on Monday morning, I have not seen a drop of rain, and temperatures have gradually warmed into the eighties. The trail has dried out and hiking conditions have been superb. By putting in sixteen miles yesterday, a few more than planned, I had an easy nine miles to Dennis Cove Road, and then a half-mile walk to the Black Bear Resort. Black Bear -- a series of cabins, a bunk room, common showers and bathrooms, a laundry, and a resupply store -- is a haven for hikers. Taken over five years ago by Stephanie and her family, it is uber-clean, pleasant and relaxing. I can't crow enough about it. I chose to grab a two-person cabin instead of staying in the bunk room when I decided to spend a second night here, which takes some explanation. My targeted destination for tomorrow was the Watauga Lake Shelter. But due to recurring bear activity, it was closed in April, and there is no camping allowed at all in the surrounding area. Thus, northbound hikers either need to camp south of the area, resulting in a short hiking day, or hike through the Watauga Dam area out to the other side and camp there, making for a long day, longer than I wanted. Once at Black Bear, I discovered a third option. Tomorrow morning, I will be shuttled by car north, beyond the bear activity area, and I, now heading south, will hike the thirteen miles back to the Black Bear Resort, spending a second night here. Then, on Sunday morning, I will be shuttled back to the same point and continue my journey northward towards the Virginia border. With this somewhat convoluted route, I will not miss a step of the AT, while avoiding the bear-threatened shelter. Today's photo is a page from The AT Guide, an indispensable reference book compiled by AWOL, a thru-hiker some years back. Now in, I believe, its 15th year, The AT Guide offers hikers a mile-by-mile description of the entire trail. It notes all water sources, shelters, campsites, towns, roads and other landmarks along the trail. Thus, you are always able to place yourself on the trail with a good degree of accuracy. In addition, the Guide shows the elevation in feet of those various landmarks, and, in each page's watermark, depicts the elevation profile of that section's terrain, broken into one thousand-foot bars. Each page presents 19.5 miles of the trail. This particular page shows northbound miles 508.5 to 526.0 (equating to southbound miles 1,663.1 to 1,680.6.) In this section of the trail, located in Virginia, elevations range from 2,450 feet to 4,240 feet. There are two shelters, Hurricane Mountain Shelter and Trimpi Shelter (noted in bold) , and at mile 518.3, one can get to Troutdale, VA, by taking VA-16 south 2.6 miles. This book allows one to plan out their hiking schedule, as far into the future as one would like. I tend to look two or three days ahead, developing an idea of how many miles I would like to hike each day and where I would like to stay. Needless to say, those plans often change. At mile 518.3, you'll also notice a reference is made to page 58. That page presents a map of Troutdale, showing in detail the location of hostels, hotels, grocery stores, the post office, laundromats, restaurants and any other points of interest for hikers. If you find you want to stay or resupply in Troutdale, you'll be fully prepped before you get there. To save weight, I bought the book in loose-leaf form, started out with only the first 500 miles, and dispose of each page after I pass through its miles. The Guide also comes in a downloadable version for your phone, but I like to work with paper on the trail. Having said that, I do have an app on my phone, Guthook's Hiking Guide, that presents much of the same information, but in electronic form. I have only referred to Guthook a few times, but when I have, it's been extremely valuable. Guthook has a GPS function that, when activated, pinpoints your location on its map of the trail. The GPS function does not require any cell service or wifi -- it even works in airplane mode. Thus, if you are ever unsure of your location, or, for instance, whether a certain landmark is ahead of or behind you, Guthook will set you straight. There are so many tools, websites, blogs and videos about long distance hiking, gear and the AT that, with somewhat concerted effort, an aspiring hiker can feel better prepared for the journey at hand. In the end, if you can learn to use all the information available in The AT Guide or Guthook, and stay alert enough to follow the trail's white blazes, then you'll have a pretty good chance at understanding how to navigate the AT. Then the fun part begins.","

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535527,"On the trail, things previously important lose definition. Or change their defining characteristics. Today was the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, before reserved for family, friends, celebration and preparing for summer. To a hiker, though, its significance narrows to simply more day hikers on the trail. Just as Sundays become the one day when you can't pick up a resupply box at the post office. But this holiday weekend had a bit more impact on me than just more day hikers. I'm now near Hampton, Tennessee, home to Watauga Dam that creates Watauga Lake. The dam was built under the TVA in the forties, and the lake is a recreational draw for people miles around. In the first part of my hike today, I crossed over the dam and hugged the shore of the lake for a couple of miles. Then, I went directly through the recreational area at the southern end of the lake, with, among other things, a place for swimming. Given that the temperatures were heading towards the high eighties, that it was the beginning of Memorial Day weekend, and that Rte. 321 passes conveniently close by, the rec area was packed with cars, trucks, motorcycles and people, and the lake was crammed with a significant number of boats. Well, I just wasn't prepared for the noise. Powerboats revving, jet skis whining, Harleys growling, tractor trailers lumbering and dogs barking. I was knocked off of life's cadence that had taken hold over the past month in the woods. Life lived at two miles per hour is rhythmic, defined by a mode of movement developed through evolution. It is no match for the speed at which modern life proceeds. The contrast was jarring and not at all welcome. I just wanted to be back in the woods. At the end of the day's hike, I came upon Laurel Falls (photo), another draw for visitors. Certainly impressive, the falls attracts a big following and the trail leading from the parking lot full of cars was wide and well-traveled. Between the noisy lake and crowded falls, it seemed I had entered a different world to which I no longer easily belonged. It was time to move on, but at 2 mph, moving on was going to take some time.(Note: I hiked this section southbound.)","Dennis Cove Road

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535616,"Today was the third of three relatively short days that I had promised myself to give my legs somewhat of a rest. Starting out at 2,250 feet, the trail gradually climbed all hike long, reaching its highest point of 4,095 feet as I pulled into Iron Mountain Shelter to end the day. Seeing very few people all day, it was a nice change from yesterday's crowds. In fact, I'm here tonight with only four others in camp. Today's excitement came courtesy of Mother Nature. I happened upon a nice four- or five-foot snake sunning himself in the middle of the trail. Unlike other animals I have come across, he was all to happy to have his picture taken without scooting away. Just a bit earlier, I was hiking a section of the trail that cut across a steep hill. To my left, below me, I heard a tremendous commotion as a large animal, presumably a bear, crashed through the underbrush and headed downhill, away from me. Seconds later, I saw a beautiful cub, to my right, up above me. He held his ground for several seconds, allowing me a good long look. Putting two and two together, I concluded that Mama Bear had run off below me and her cub had run off above me, leaving yours truly in the one place you don't want to be: between mother and child. Thankfully, the trail immediately took a turn that moved me to relative safety, and I didn't see the two bears, hopefully quickly reunited, again. To cap off my day, I flushed yet another bear shortly after seeing the snake. A good-sized one, he or she had been beside the trail, perhaps 25 yards in front of me, and, when learning of my presence, went headlong into the underbrush, away from the trail and me. As he moved off, he stayed in my sights for quite a ways. He was a big, beautiful animal. I have now had five bear sightings on my trek. In all cases, the bears were exquisite, and ran away quickly without any prodding. They clearly were not looking for any extended human contact. Finally, a couple of days ago, I saw my first Indigo Bunting ever, a bird so brilliantly blue (or indigo) that it seemed unnaturally so. What a thrill!","Wilbur Dam Road

That, indeed, was the case, and the sixteen miles I had planned to Abingdon Gap Shelter zipped right by. I finished my day of hiking at 3:00 pm. Feeling like a condor on the currents, I cruised along a ridge for most of the day, moving lightly as the AT gently rose and fell to meet my feet. I don't remember a day this easy on the trail before, but it may be matched, and even outdone, by tomorrow's hike as I skip down the last ten miles into Damascus, crossing the border between Tennessee and Virginia in the process. Even though I spent most of the day between 3,500 and 4,000 feet in elevation, I came upon a lovely farm whose cows seemed to like to hug the trail. There they sat and stood, literally blocking my passage, with no inclination to move. Assuming they had seen my like before, I wove through them, rejoined the trail, and they paid me no mind. The sun was out for most of the day and it was quite warm when I, from time to time, emerged from the protective cloaking of the trees. But with the ridge tree-lined and forest more prevalent than farm, I stayed relatively cool and happy. Tonight, the shelter and its surrounding tenting area are quite full with thru-hikers. The mood is jovial as Damascus, perhaps the best known trail town on the AT, is within reach by noon tomorrow.

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536162,"As I mentioned yesterday, my friends, Fritz and Brian from Rochester, NY, are coming to hike with me for three days. I needed some local knowledge to figure out which nearby stretch of the AT would be fun and worthwhile for all, and could be accessed by shuttle to get my friends ultimately back to the airport. After speaking with Mt. Rogers Outfitters of Damascus, VA, we settled on a thirty-two mile hike that will take us up and over Mt. Rogers, Virginia's highest mountain, and through Grayson Highlands, famous for its wild ponies. We'll start Saturday morning at Mile 486 and end midday Monday at Mile 518. With their visit thus planned, and knowing that Alison arrives tomorrow for a two-day visit, I had to figure out how all the pieces fit together. First things first, I had to get myself to Damascus. So, this morning, I walked the relatively flat ten miles from Abingdon Gap Shelter into Damascus, crossing out of Tennessee for the last time, and into Virginia. Despite the easy terrain, my legs were a bit sluggish, but I still reached town in time for lunch, which I ate in the Damascus Town Park. With my stomach refueled, I now had 24 hours to ""kill"" before Alison arrived, and I decided to do what any thru-hiker would do: hike some more. With Damascus lying at Mile 469 of the AT, and my trip with Fritz and Brian set to start at Mile 486, that left a seventeen mile stretch between the two to be hiked.So, in the afternoon, I set off to hike 7.6 miles to Saunders Shelter. Were my legs still feeling sluggish, as they were in the morning? Absolutely not! I was clearly vibrating at a higher frequency. That could be due to the 20-ounce Dr. Pepper and the Nestle's Crunch Ice Cream Bar that accompanied lunch. (My former self, presently locked away in a closet for six months, must be horrified at some of the recently-approved choices that now appear on my personal menu.)I had no trouble navigating a few tough, but short, climbs on the way to Saunders, and settled in for the night in the shelter, knowing there was a chance of rain.

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536269,"Today has been a nice, relaxing day with Alison, doing some trail chores, making phone calls to my parents and children, and, of course, eating. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC), tracing its origins to 1925, is a non-profit confederation of thirty-one local organizations whose goal is to preserve, manage and maintain the AT. The ATC coined the phrase ""2,000 Miler"" to bestow on those who have hiked every mile of the AT. To qualify as a 2,000 Miler, you may undertake the journey in one mammoth, continuous trip done in one hiking season -- a thru-hike -- or complete the entire trail over a series of years, one section at a time -- a section hike. Section hikers will spend one to multiple weeks on the trail each year, doing different sections. A complete section hike of the AT may take two years, ten years, or even twenty years, depending on the length of each year's sections that a hiker chooses to bite off. But, when every one of the 2,189 miles has been hiked, the section hiker qualifies as a 2,000 miler. Thru-hiking typically requires five to seven months of continuous hiking. There are three ways to thru-hike the AT: northbound, southbound, and flip-flop, a catch-all phrase comprising a number of alternative itineraries. A Northbounder, or NoBo, will start at Springer Mountain in Georgia, and walk continuously until finishing at Mount Katahdin in Maine. One would typically begin from March 1 to April 15, would encounter large crowds of hikers in Georgia and North Carolina, and would hike through cold weather and snow in the southern mountains. Some 85 percent of those attempting thru-hikes are NoBos. Southbounders, or SoBos, start at Katahdin and walk continuously to Springer Mountain, Georgia. Less than 10% of those attempting thru-hikes choose this option, given that you start among the mountains of Maine and New Hampshire, the most challenging terrain of the trail, before you've had a chance to develop your ""trail legs"" and endurance. Given the snowpack and weather in Maine, SoBos do not typically start until June or July, and will face the dreaded black fly season in Maine if they begin on the early end of that period. Finally, Flip-Floppers will hike continuously for five to seven months, but complete all the miles in a non-linear fashion. With the ATC actively encouraging alternative itineraries to try to smooth and spread out the impact of hikers on the AT, there are a number of flip-flop versions outlined on ATC's website, plus other alternative ways with inventive names such as ""Wrap-around"", ""Cool Breeze"" and ""Leapfrog"". In 2014, 5% of all thru-hike efforts were done as a flip-flop or some alternative itinerary. Generally, a hiker completing the AT as a flip-flopper will hike the first part of the trek in one direction, and then ""flip flop"" to another point on the trail and hike in the opposite direction.As I've mentioned before, I chose as my hike the ""Late Start Flip-Flop"". I began at Springer Mountain on April 22nd after the hiker bubble, am hiking northbound to Harper's Ferry (just shy of the trail's mid-point), will then jump up to Katahdin in mid-July, and finish my hike southbound back to Harper's Ferry sometime in October. This year, the ATC estimates that 3,000 hikers will attempt to thru-hike the AT. Attrition rates for thru-hikers are high and have remained steady in recent years: about 75% of those starting out to thru-hike will not complete their intended journeys. But that still means that about one quarter will accomplish their 2,189 mile goal, and I hope to be included in their ranks as a 2,000 miler.","Damascus

Fritz and Brian arrived a few hours later, and we shuttled up to Mile 486, where the AT crosses US 58, and headed north on the trail. Since it was already after 5:00 pm, we hiked 1.5 miles to a pine-needled campsite and set up. Water was a pain to get, but with two trips down a ravine, we were all topped off.

Fritz and Brian kept up a good pace as we climbed from 3,700 feet to 5,400 feet over the course of the day. We had no trouble finding water, and enjoyed lunch on the flank of Whitetop Mountan, overlooking a picturesque valley. After lunch, we had our first encounter with the wild ponies of Mt. Rogers. Clearly comfortable with humans, they stepped right up, hoping for food of some sort, which, not surprisingly, we did not offer. Disappointed, one pony decided to slobber all over my hiking pole, while another kept nudging Fritz and me. There were several young ones among the crowd of about ten ponies, and they were utterly cute. After arriving at Thomas Knob Shelter, just below the summit of Mt. Rogers, we explored a number of breathtaking campsites and settled on one about a quarter mile beyond the shelter. It was a nice patch of grass, overlooking a stupendous vista of layered mountain ranges, forming a view that demanded one's attention. After we pitched our tents, we were paid a visit by the grounds crew that maintained a number of the grassy tent sites: the ponies. Again, without any fear or bashfulness, they started helping themselves to the grass surrounding our two tents, and kept eating until the rain hit. We had been in camp for about an hour, long enough to pitch tents, unload out packs, complete water chores and watch the ponies. Then, at 4:00, the forecasted thunderstorms finally hit. When you're on a ridge at 5,400 feet and the lightning and thunder starts, it's quite a show: scary for some, at least nerve-wracking for most. With the sky often illuminated by brilliant bursts, and the thunder rumbling and echoing through the multitude of mountains, we were fortunate in our tents, riding out nature's show. The rain was relentless, coming in heavier and heavier sheets. The wind ratcheted up, the grass became quickly saturated and large puddles formed all around our tents. Had Noah a website, he could have sold a number of arks. After a good hour, the thunderstorms finally relented and we emerged quickly for dinner, thinking another round of storms was possible. All in all, we were quite happy that our six-hour hike today was dry, and that the storms hit after we were pitched and prepared. Tomorrow, we may not be so lucky, as rain and thunderstorms are forecasted for much of the day. If they are anything like those that hit this afternoon, it might get interesting, as we are hiking the high ridge that forms the Grayson Highlands, one of the ""do not miss"" experiences in Virginia. This has been Fritz's first real backpacking experience, and the mountain vistas, ponies and thunderstorms have thus far made it a memorable one. I just hope that tomorrow is not a complete wash-out.","Campsite at Mile 487.4

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536942,"The thunderstorms that hit at 4:00 pm yesterday proved to be just the beginning, but the night sky toyed with me a bit first. When I threw open my tent doors at 1:00 am for a bathroom break, I was greeted by an overhead canvas full of stars. It was magnificent, and very unexpected. The Little Dipper stood out, and it seemed that every other star was helping to light the heavens. Maybe the rain had moved out....Nice thought. At 4:00 am, the skies opened up again, matching the magnitude of the previous afternoon's storm. Fortunately, the rain stopped long enough between 6:30 and 8:00 am that we were able to pack up camp and eat without getting soaked. For the rest of the day, though, we hiked in and out of rain. When it stopped long enough, the sun would peak out and heat things up. Or the wind would kick up. Or it would soon rain harder. The impact was that I never seemed to have the right outerwear on, and I spent the day changing layers. Brian and Fritz seemed less affected than me, especially Fritz, who settled on his hiking garb early on and wore it throughout the day. As we entered Grayson Highlands State Park, I passed a tree which had a ""500"" etched into its white blaze. That caused a small celebration and photograph, and I'm glad that Brian and Fritz were there to share my latest AT milestone. We shortly thereafter hiked to the top of a significant outcropping to better take in our surroundings. The sun was valiantly trying to break through, but the clouds refused to yield. Still, a small number of the sun's rays did manage to hit the distant mountaintops and the effect was wonderful. It was short-lived, however, as fog quickly drifted down from Mt. Rogers to completely close in the highlands. As we approached the Old Orchard Shelter to finish our day's hiking, the rain finally stopped, and we had three dry hours to pitch out tents, do our water and bear-bagging chores, and relax a bit. We also helped a group from Ohio to start a campfire, which we enjoyed before and during dinner. Just as we finished cleaning up from our meal, showers returned and we withdrew to our tents for the night. With all this rain, I couldn't help but wonder when Fritz and Brian were going to be ready to call off our hiking adventure. In fact, I silently began to think what I would do to get us picked up early, as I hadn't had any cell service since we started climbing on Friday evening. But, in the midst of yet another downpour, they both quickly dismissed any idea of abandoning our trip, and in fact said they were happy to be experiencing the full spectrum of backpacking. I must hand it to both Brian and Fritz: hiking and camping in the rain is demanding and sometimes demoralizing, but they plowed right through as if sunshine ruled the sky instead of rain clouds. Tomorrow is our final day together, and I will miss their company. I'm quite thankful that they made the rather significant effort of coming to share a few days of my thru-hike with me.","Thomas Knob Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537229,"Fritz and I went to graduate school together, meeting there twenty-nine years ago. He was already married to Maura, and I soon met Alison when she enrolled in the class behind us. After graduation, Fritz and Maura chose to live in Rochester, NY, and Alison and I moved to the Corning, NY, area, just 90 minutes from Rochester. With our respective children sharing the same ages, we often made the trip to visit them. Over the ensuing years, we have remained quite close, recently spending holidays together. Growing older with friends you cherish, and sharing with them your turn on this planet....there is simply nothing like it. Alison and I are so fortunate. I had met Brian, a very close friend of Fritz's from Rochester, long ago on one of our visits there, but hadn't seen him in some time. When he and Fritz pulled into Damascus from the airport, it was as if no time had passed. I enjoyed Brian's company all weekend long.This morning, we made quick work of the 9.3 miles to Dickey Gap, where a van picked them up to shuttle them back to their rental car in Damascus. From there, they headed to the airport to fly out. Thankfully, the sun was out for our last day together. I hiked on in the afternoon, adding another 7.7 miles to the day. Having said good-bye to Alison in Damascus on Friday, and now having seen off Fritz and Brian at Dickey Gap, I was suddenly, plainly alone. I now inhabit one world -- the world of hiking solo -- and am on the fringe of another -- the life that Alison and I have built with family and friends. Going from one to the other and back is hard -- harder than simply missing the one I have temporarily left behind. I will not have any more visitors on the trail until I am almost out of Virginia.

Chance to squint at a sky so blue that it hurts your eyes just to look at it."" I got my chance today outside Atkins, VA. After all the rain of the past few days, a cold front came through, bringing with it fall-like breezes. The high today in the hills never broke 70, probably welcome at this time of year in southern Virginia. As I approached Atkins, the AT moved through an area of farms, where the fields had yet to be hayed. The rather ample breeze had the grasses swaying in a most pleasant way, and the blue sky and white clouds deserved to be on a Vermont postcard, accompanied by a red barn and autumn-colored trees. In fact, the sky was so blue that it commanded you to lay on your back in the grass and take in its depth. And the clouds were so white that ""white"" just didn't seem to be nearly descriptive enough. This was quintessential American countryside. Leaves on the breeze showing their undersides, high grasses flanking country paths, big, broad trees standing sentry, rolling landscape holding dells and hills. It was perfect.","Mile 526

There was a little mix-up at the post office with my food resupply box, and it took me a bit of time to straighten it out. But, I really didn't mind, since the quality of service that I have thus far received from the USPS has been exemplary.   From Hiawassee to Fontana Dam, Hot Springs, Damascus and Marion, my interactions with postal employees have been a highlight of my AT trek. The problem with my resupply box this morning was the first and only USPS hiccup that I've had all trip, and everyone is allowed one mulligan in my book. In this case, no harm was done by my temporarily waylaid package, although it did delay my departure from Atkins until 10:30 am. In a way, it was fortuitous, since it caused me to hike until almost 6:00 pm, and the late afternoon proved to be just incredibly beautiful, both in its weather and the terrain through which I hiked. It was cool and crisp all day long, probably not getting out of the 60s. The breeze was again a cooling factor, and yesterday's blue sky and white clouds decided to stay with me a second day. The trail again wove its way through pastures and old fields, allowing me another opportunity to revel in the countryside surroundings. At the bottom of one particularly beautiful pasture, Lumbermack, a local land owner and thru-hiker (2006), had pulled his pick-up off the road and was treating hikers to soda from the cooler in the truck bed (photo).Tonight, the forecast calls for temperatures in the high 40s, as this little cold front hangs around for another day. While in Damascus, I bought myself a new 55 degree sleeping bag for the summer, and sent my 20 degree bag home. Thus far, the new bag has been a home run, and I'm sleeping like a baby. Tonight, though, would have presented problems for it, if I didn't have my silk liner, long underwear and down jacket (if needed) to sleep in. With all these weapons in my sleeping arsenal, I'll be warm and comfortable.","Atkins, VA

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537667,"As I've moved deeper into Virginia, the number of dependable water sources, either streams or springs, has decreased. There have been as many as ten miles between sources of running water recently. As one consequence, the distance between shelters has increased in places, since it only makes sense to locate them near confirmed sources of water. Last night, I stayed at Knot Maul Branch Shelter. If tonight I wanted to again pitch my tent adjacent to a shelter, then I would have to hike either ten miles to the next one, or twenty miles to the one beyond that. Camping in between was not an option: there was no available water.At this point on my trek, going only ten miles in a day doesn't sit well, unless there is a good reason. So, I chose to hike the twenty miles to Jenkins Shelter. This didn't seem like an outrageous decision: I had already done one ""twenty"" in the Smokies, and the elevation profile in The AT Guide looked quite manageable. I packed up quickly in the morning to get going, and was on the trail by 7:15. The evening cold had not yet lifted. For the morning, I faced a climb of 2,100 feet, but the grades were manageable, and the trail well-maintained, and I made decent time. I was climbing up to Chestnut Ridge, and was pleased to find that much of the early ridge was maintained as open meadow (photo). Still, the climb was long and I found myself quite tired as the trail finally crested. As the afternoon took over, that lovely trail I had been following turned into an obstacle course. Baseball-, softball-, and football-sized rocks littered the trail, many quite angular with unavoidable edges. At the same time, the ridge began to rise and fall with annoying regularity, increasing the difficulty of navigating the rock fields. This twenty mile hike quickly took on a demonic quality. Fortunately, blue skies and cool weather again prevailed, so at least the hiking conditions were favorable. But, as the afternoon dragged on, the trail's toll on my feet and legs became apparent and when I finally reached camp, I was exhausted both physically and mentally. Mother Theresa, Non-Stop and Gravy joined me that evening at the shelter, and we all agreed that that was one of the toughest stretches we had hiked yet. For the first time since beginning my trek, I couldn't keep my eyes open to write, and I went to bed without my journal entry complete.","Knot Maul Branch Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537891,"After my tiring twenty mile day yesterday, the trail and I cooperated to give me just what I needed: a relatively short hike, with, for the most part, easy terrain. For the day, I elected to hike 13.5 miles to Helveys Mill Shelter. Going any farther made no sense, as The AT Guide showed no water for the following ten miles, and besides, I was beat. I stayed in my sleeping bag a bit longer than usual, electing to break camp at 8:30 am instead of my normal 7:30. When I emerged from my tent, it was once again a bit chilly, and the morning weather was close to a carbon copy of the previous few days: cool, breezy, brilliant blue sky. The only change? Not a cloud to be seen. Relishing the somewhat abbreviated day, I made quick work of a few tough, but short, climbs, and moved along fairly well on the flatter parts. But, I took note that my legs did not bounce back completely from yesterday's long march. The trail again followed a tree-lined 3,000 foot ridge for most of the day, and, thankfully, the rocks that made yesterday's hike so difficult were not in evidence. I try, in today's photo, to show the ridge from the ""inside"". Note the trail in the middle, with both sides of the ridge dropping away, down hill. Tomorrow, I'll post a picture of how the ridge looks on the ""outside"", from across the valley. In the afternoon, the change I knew had to be coming soon, hit. The temperature rose dramatically, easily making it to the mid, if not high, eighties. Luckily being under forest cover, the impact was not huge, but it seems the days of sixties and seventies have probably left southern Virginia for the summer. Tonight's forecasted temperature is for the low sixties, about fifteen degrees warmer than last night's. There is a fabulous group of thru-hikers in camp tonight, and guitar-playing and story-telling broke out after everyone finished dinner. I have caught back up with the year's final wave of NoBos -- all in their twenties. Being in camp with such an enthusiastic crew makes for good fun.","Jenkins Shelter

In today's photo, I show such a ridge to give you an idea of how uniform it looks from the ""outside"". The temperatures today, following yesterday afternoon's lead, soared well into the eighties. When I did emerge from tree cover, the heat was approaching furnace-like. I quickly adjusted my thinking and gave thanks for that tree-protected ridge. And this heat isn't going anywhere; I believe the forecast calls for nineties on Tuesday. On the forest animal front, I saw another bear today. Now that I've come across these handsome creatures a number of times, they no longer completely surprise me, and I can take better note of them. Today's learning is just how quickly they accelerate. When the bear saw me and retreated, he went from standing still to a full bear-gallop in a second or two. Remember that old adage, ""I don't need to outrun the bear, I only need to outrun you""? Trust me, there is no outrunning the bear. I also saw a doe and an impossibly small fawn just off the trail today. The youngster was doing his best to keep up with Mom and scurry to safety, but he was all legs and couldn't quite get the four going in the same direction at the same time. Precious. I ended the day at Dismal Falls, a decent-sized cascade that more importantly has a generous swimming hole at its base.

Including today's 13.1 miles that I hiked to arrive at Woods Hole Hostel, I have put in 136 miles since my last zero. I can certainly justify my decisions....scarce water made some long days necessary; I wanted to regain touch with the last wave of NoBos; I took advantage of the cool weather early in the week.However, the reality is that my body is telling me to get more rest and to slow down. I've lost the bounce in my step. My knees are beginning to send signals to me. I've been more tired than usual at the end of the day. And, most critically, I've had to work hard mentally to finish each day's mileage. The good news is that I have had a plan for my hike, and it absolutely allows time for recharging. Putting in an eighteen-mile day here or there is fine, especially if the terrain is accommodating, and Virginia is purported to be easier in sections. But, pretending I need to continue to put in big mileage at a time when it's getting hotter, is dangerous. I need to be a better student of my own plan, listen to my body, and slow down when called for, even if it means falling behind this NoBo wave. As much as I enjoy seeing familiar faces in camp at night, I cannot let that jeopardize the completion of my thru-hike. Message duly received. If I focus instead on 100-mile weeks through Virginia, each including a zero , then I'll be fine. Not waiting long to follow my own advice, on today's hike to Woods Hole, I consciously slowed down. Over the past week, I feel like I've been forcing my pace, instead of flowing with the terrain. In fact, I know I had increased my average speed while hiking this past week from 2 mph to 2.25 mph. Now, that may not sound like much, but to achieve that extra quarter-mile per hour, it takes effort -- effort that in the long run is self-defeating. My arrival at Woods Hole, a hostel with an emphasis on sustainable living through beekeeping, farming, organic gardening, yoga and massage therapy, could not have been better timed. Many have said it is a slice of heaven and should not be passed up. I pulled in at 2:30, took a shower, shaved, and had my laundry done. Tomorrow, I am zeroing here and already have a massage scheduled. I look forward to recharging my batteries during my stay.","Dismal Falls

Neville and Michael are wonderful hosts, the staff is quite attentive, and last night's home-cooked dinner was fantastic. We had quite a crew of thru-hikers join me for the first of my two nights here, and the post-dinner campfire was a welcome way to end the evening. Taking full advantage of my zero, I enjoyed a massage this morning, repaired a small tear in my tent's bug netting, planned out my mileage for the week, made a few phone calls, packed up my food resupply that awaited me here, and generally took it easy. I look forward to another relaxing evening tonight. While I was in Damascus two weeks ago, I relied heavily on the staff at Mt. Rogers Outfitters. Jeff, Jason, Cheyenne and Matt, in turn, advised me on the itinerary for the three-day hike that Fritz, Brian and I took, shuttled us around, and sold me a summer weight sleeping bag. They were knowledgable, friendly, took great interest in my thru-hike, and acted as Damascus ambassadors. So, when I asked Jeff to look at my pack to see if he could recommend some adjustments to improve its fit, he jumped right in. He tugged on this and pulled on that to loosen it in some places and tighten it in others. He also made a key observation: I had the wrong-sized pack. He confirmed what I had felt all along: a large-sized pack, no matter its specifications, simply didn't make sense for 5' 9"" hiker weighing 160 pounds, soon to be 155. I really didn't want to hear it, since I had invested in a new pack, the Granite Gear Lutsen 45, no more than four weeks earlier in Nantahala, and the Lutsen wasn't that bad. It was a definite improvement over the pack I started with, and, after a week or two of use, I scored it a ""stand-up triple."" Now, in hindsight, that may have been more aspirational than accurate. I wanted to believe it was that good, even if I had my doubts.Anyway, after Jeff was done with his adjustments, he offered his professional opinion. In short, no matter how I adjusted and wore the Lutsen, he could make me more comfortable in a new, properly-sized one. Hesitantly, I asked which pack he would recommend. He was quick to come back: the ULE Circuit, a pack that I have seen on the AT quite often. He was completely convinced that if I bought the Circuit in a medium, I would be happy. As a first step, I transferred all my gear to the recommended Circuit to see how it would carry it all. I noticed a few advantages right away, chief among them the much larger pockets on the hip belt that would hold my phone, snacks, reading glasses and other personal items, obviating the need for that phone pouch that gave me so much trouble back in Fontana Dam. As I tried on the now fully-loaded Circuit, it felt better, rode higher (a good thing), and received a thumbs up from both Jeff and Jason. Now it was decision time. Would a third pack really make a difference? Was that potential difference worth the price?In the end, I knew that my current pack, the Lutsen, was simply ""okay"", and, with 1,900 miles left, ""okay"" was not going to cut it. I crossed my fingers and bought the ULE Circuit. That was all two weeks ago, as I have waited to divulge my latest purchase until I had some performance data to go with it. Cutting to the chase, I am so happy that I followed Jeff's advice. I am now certain that I have the pack with which I will finish the AT. Tomorrow morning, I am back on the trail.

The day, however, wasn't so perfect for hiking.I put in 18.0 miles from Woods Hole Hostel to the shelter. On the way, I climbed down 2,000 feet from one ridge into Pearisburg, VA, then climbed back up 1,700 feet to another ridge. Pearisburg, sitting in a river valley, was hotter than the blazes, and I hiked in and out without so much as turning my head to look around. It must have been 90 degrees when I passed through. The five-mile climb back up consumed the hottest part of the afternoon. Normally, tree cover would have provided a nice respite from the heat, but the trees on this particular ridge seemed to have recently fed an army of caterpillars and inchworms. With leaves half-eaten, the sun had a field day in baking the trail, and I was collateral damage. Still, I managed to trudge right along, and took advantage of a spring just below the shelter to enjoy a sponge bath. Had there been a breeze during the climb, it would have made for better hiking conditions, but there wasn't a breath of air. All in all, it was easily the hottest, and most sweaty, day on the trail yet. Tonight's sunset is a beautiful collection of subtle pinks and purples, and is the first one that I've seen from my tent.

By morning, humidity had moved in, and, for the first time in ten days, it seemed that it might rain.Instead, the wind died down, and the humidity joined with the increasing heat to provide another day of challenging conditions. I began the day thinking I would hike 16.5 miles from Rice Field Shelter to Bailey Gap Shelter. As I moved along, I started to rethink that. If I could get a little farther along than 16.5, then the 21 miles that I had planned for the next day would be reduced to something more manageable. In somewhat of a repeat from yesterday, I started out hiking on a ridge, but then steeply descended when the trail dove to follow a river for a bit. Not only was it hotter at the lower elevation, but, this being the AT, it meant another big climb back up. But this wasn't any ordinary ""big climb"". First, the climb back up came at the end of a long, hot and humid day. Second, it felt like it might have been the sharpest ascent of my entire trek. As I put my head down and focused on making sure my feet continued to move, I missed the side trail below Bailey Gap Shelter that led to the water source. By the time I backtracked and filled up on water, thunder had started to rumble, and, around 4:00 pm, I abandoned any ideas of going beyond 16.5 miles. I headed up to the shelter to sit inside, waiting to see if the thunder would actually lead to rain. I didn't have to wait long. The skies opened, and I stayed put, quite happy to sleep in the shelter, where I was high and dry while it rained on and off all night.","Rice Field Shelter

Shelters also have the added attractions of picnic tables for preparing and eating meals, privies,and the company of other hikers. Finally, if rain does appear imminent, I have the option of sleeping in the shelter, although I try to stay in my tent as much as possible. Based on the location of the next set of shelters, I prepared myself for a 21 mile hike. If I succeeded at making it that far, then I would have very manageable hikes of 16, 17 and 15 miles the next three days to arrive in Daleville, VA, on Sunday, where I planned to take my next zero on Monday. So, 21 it was for today. The only issue, I saw right away, was that the 21 miles contained not just one, but two major climbs, the first before lunch, and the second to end the day. After last night's rain, the trail and all its surrounding vegetation was soaked in the morning, and my hiking shoes soon followed suit. The day started out incredibly foggy, which was nice for no other reason than it kept the temperatures cool. As the morning progressed, one could literally feel it drying out, and, although the day was again hot, it was considerably less humid than the past two days. It is amazing to witness how one's expectations affect, positively or negatively, one's hiking. Knowing that I wanted to complete 21 miles, I put in 13.4 miles before a late lunch, and felt great doing it. On some occasions, it's all I can do to crank out 14 or 15 miles by day'send, but here I was at 13.4 miles before lunch....and all because I had set the intention of 21 miles today. The climb before lunch was as tough as billed, and when I removed my pack, shoes and socks to enjoy peanut butter on tortillas, I was happy to be off my feet. But, my rest was short-lived, as I still had 7.6 miles to go, and another very strenuous climb to end the day. As the afternoon progressed, the trail took me through Virginia farms, pastures and fields, putting me in a good mood to tackle the end-of-day climb that looked quite imposing in The AT Guide. When I pulled into Sarver Hollow Shelter at 6:15 pm, I was happy, but spent. I had been hiking since 7:15 am, an eleven-hour day on the trail, the longest all trek for me both in time and miles walked. My reward?

Today, though, the state had a little bit more in store for me. I started off the day by hiking the three-mile ridge crest of Sinking Creek Mountain. The eastern edge of the mountain's ridge was exposed ledge running for much of the three miles, and trees had no chance of taking root. Thus, the views east and southeast over the valley and to the next ridge and beyond were open and spectacular. It felt like I was above treeline, even though the ridge never exceeded 3,400 feet in elevation. The large expanses of ledge were sloped at a severe angle, and it took utter faith that my hiking shoes would maintain a grip to negotiate some of the steeper parts. I had a very tough time choosing the photo for today's post, as I could have selected any one of half a dozen. The next surprise in store for me came as I was climbing Brush Mountain, where Audie Murphy, the most decorated American soldier in World War II, died in 1971 when his plane crashed near the summit. Widely scattered rain and thunderstorms had visited Virginia over the past two days, stopping our streak of good weather at nine days. Most had come at night, and, at least where I was, it never really got bad. Well, that was about to change. Still short of the summit as I climbed Brush Mountain, the skies let loose. This wasn't a thunderstorm, but an old fashioned deluge. It lasted for perhaps 15 minutes, and I chose to stop hiking and wait it out under my umbrella. When it had sufficiently slowed, I resumed my climb to the summit, looking forward to visiting the Audie Murphy monument maintained at the top. Upon arriving there, I put my pack down, opened my food bag for a snack, and ambled over to the engraved stone. I read the first line when, without the warning of thunder or lightning, the heavens began to dispense water at a rate that boggled the mind. As quickly as I could, I closed my pack and engaged my umbrella, hoping to stay somewhat dry. Since I was now on the summit ridge, there was no place to go for protection. Much like on Sinking Creek Mountain, the AT ran for a few miles along the crest, and, unlike the previous downpour, this one lasted at least thirty minutes. The trail was quickly turned into a torrent, and I felt badly for the few hikers around me who, lacking umbrellas, looked wholly unhappy as the rain kept coming. As I lie in my tent tonight at Pickled Branch Shelter, the sun is setting and blue skies abound. Today's 16.1 miles had more than enough excitement for me.

In the morning, I summited Cove Mountain to arrive at Dragon's Tooth, a stone outcropping that juts up from the peak. To gain the top of the monolith, one must employ a few inventive moves to maneuver up opposing walls of stone. It took me a few starts to finally figure out an approach that would work. The view from the top was expansive and worth every effort. To get to, and down from, Dragon's Tooth, took longer than I expected, as the slabs of rock found at the top also blessed the trail in various places. Rock-hopping for great stretches, the going was slow and one had to be quite deliberate to avoid slips and falls. By 11:30 am, I had made just seven miles, and still had ten more to go for the day. I stopped at a local grocery at a crossroads to pick up a few supplies and eat an early lunch. When I got back on the trail at 12:30, I had my work cut out for me. I wanted to make it to McAfee's Knob, supposedly the most photographed spot on the AT, by 5:00, and I wasn't sure if the trail was going to be as demanding as it was on the way to Dragon's Tooth. So, into high gear I went. Thankfully, the AT up to McAfee's was considerably kinder than I had anticipated, and I cruised right along. I passed the parking lot that day hikers use to access McAfee's, and, on this Saturday of Father's Day weekend, it was packed. I wasn't sure what to expect when I got to the top. Fortunately, I arrived at the summit just about 5:00, and much of the crowd had thinned out, on their way back down to their cars. McAfee's Knob, a rock shelf that cantilevers out over a great valley, was stunning. I didn't have to wait long to get my chance to sit for a rather iconic AT photo (above). I hung around for a good 30 minutes, enjoying the views, the sun, and the rock ledges. Tomorrow, the trail takes me to Tinker Cliffs, more remote and less visited than either Dragon's Tooth or McAfee's Knob. From there, I head into Daleville, VA, where I will zero on Monday.","Pickled Branch Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538855,"I crawled into Daleville today, needle pegged on empty, running on one cylinder. When I awoke this morning, all seemed fine. I was excited to hike 15.4 miles to get to Daleville, where, in addition to staying tonight, I planned to zero on Monday. After I ate, I packed up camp, drank my normal liter of water, and headed out on the trail. Nothing told me to expect anything but a good day. Then, I stepped on the gas.....and got no response. It was as if I were lugging around two flat Michelins for legs. I tried eating my second Clif Bar that morning, then a third, and then my trail mix blend. No change. I moved on to drink more water, thinking dehydration perhaps. Again, no response. It was going to be a long day. Ultimately, my hiker legs never really came back all day, and the 15.4 miles felt twice that. This was truly the first day all trek that I couldn't get my legs to respond. The good news is that I'm convinced that I just emptied the proverbial tank well below the bottom set point over the past five days. Now that I'm here in Daleville, with a zero tomorrow, I have two dinners, two breakfasts, and one lunch at which to eat major amounts of food, plus all the snacking in between I can get in. I expect that will have a winning effect. While slogging along today, I indeed passed Tinker Cliffs, where I was all by myself save for two others. The cliffs offered a great view of the same valley that McAfee's did yesterday, only from a different vantage. I also passed high above Carvin Cove Reservoir (photo), serving, I believe, the city of Roanoke, VA. So far today, I have checked into a Howard Johnson's, done my laundry, showered, returned some Father's Day phone calls, and ate ridiculous amounts of food at my first Daleville dinner. I have a long list of chores to do tomorrow, in between stuffing away more food.","Campbell Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539129,"Despite the rain that starting falling at 5:00 this afternoon, I am the only person at the shelter tonight. It's been a steady, soaking rain for the past three hours, and normally that would have driven hikers here by now. I think it's a pretty good indication of just how few NoBos are still in my vicinity.   I do know at least ten are out there, having seen them in Daleville, but I also know that a number of those are starting to falter under Virginia's never ending length. I crossed from Tennessee into Virginia on May 31. Now June 21, I just today passed the halfway point in Virginia. I still have eighteen more days of hiking in the state, plus two more zeroes. I won't make it into West Virginia, the next state, until July 11th. I will have been in Virginia for six full weeks. Because the AT is so long (2,189 miles), hikers must find intermediate goals to help them feel like they are progressing. Many break the trail into 100-mile segments, or other increments, and celebrate each one finished. Most note as a milestone each time they move into a new state. The AT runs through fourteen states. Virginia has by far the most miles of trail, 555, about double that of the next state. In fact, one quarter of the entire AT is in Virginia. So, after moving through Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee, hikers find themselves seemingly ""stalled"" in Old Dominion, as it takes so long to add the state's notch to their belts. There's even a hiker community name for it: the Virginia Blues. You can see and hear it in many. The enthusiasm is gone, replaced by tedium. There is more talk of getting off, or of taking a break, or even of aqua-blazing: instead of hiking certain miles, some choose to kayak those miles on Virginia's rivers.I am fortunate. I have not suffered from the extended time here. I think part of that comes with age and the knowledge that things take time and require effort and stick-to-it-tiveness. But, I, too, developed some interim goals to help manage my mental outlook in Virginia. I am now at Mile 746. At Mile 730, I completed one third of the AT. At Mile 743, I completed one half of Virginia. At Mile 768, I will be three-quarters of the way to Harper's Ferry, West Virginia. Eighteen more hiking days left before I arrive in Harper's Ferry. That seems like a manageable number, especially since I have fifty two under my belt as of today. It will be interesting to find out just how many thru-hikers I continue to see here in Virginia. At the end of the day, though, it won't matter much. I am closing in on finishing Virginia and the first 1,000 miles of the trail, and with that, I'll be moving onto Maine.","Daleville

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539485,"As my time in Virginia continues, I've taken to planning out my hiking schedule for an entire week, rather than for just two or three days. I now realize this is one of my ways of preventing an onset of the Virginia Blues. I learned long ago that if I have a plan, then I'm more settled and can deal more effectively with uncertainty, long time horizons and setbacks. Before my departure from Daleville, I mapped out, day by day, a hiking schedule that would get me to Waynesboro, VA, the southern gateway to Shenandoah National Park, and the site of my next zero. It's 134 miles from Daleville to Waynesboro, farther than I would normally plan between zeroes, but none of the small towns in between seemed to be a good candidate for a place to recharge. With the terrain looking a bit more easy (but still containing a few mountains over 4,000 feet), I saw that eight days of hiking made sense, putting me in Waynesboro on Tuesday, June 28th. I'd start out the week somewhat hard, back off in the middle, and finish with a couple of reasonable days. To break up the eight days a bit, I'd schedule the fifth night at a hostel that came highly recommended by some other hikers. So, in miles, the first four days laid out like this: 18.5, 18.4, 17.7, and 17.2. For Day 5, I planned just 13.1 miles to allow me to arrive early at the hostel, clean up and get things dried out, if necessary. Day 6 would be another ""short"" day of 14.3 miles, this time enabling me to leave a bit later than usual in the morning, so that I could enjoy the hostel's well-regarded breakfast. For the final two days, I'd end with hikes of 18.2 and 16.4 miles, respectively. Yesterday and today, the first two days of my Waynesboro plan, went off without a hitch, their 18 mile hikes uneventful. It ends up that the AT parallels the Blue Ridge Parkway in many places over the 100 miles north of Daleville, and it was strange to actually cross it a number of times. I took today's photo during one such crossing. The Parkway was built to allow passage between two national parks: Shenandoah, in Virginia, and Great Smoky Mountains, in North Carolina. At its northern end, the Parkway terminates when it hits Skyline Drive, the ridge road through Shenandoah National Park.When I arrived at Cornelius Creek Shelter today after the second 18-miler, I again was by myself...to start. In quick order, however, seven other hikers arrived to keep me company, a group of six, and one fellow hiking solo. I had met two members of the group of six in Damascus, but the solo hiker was new to me. With my back-to-back eighteens, I had caught up with them, and it's likely I'll see them again.","Bobblets Gap Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539486,"At four o'clock this morning, I was awoken by thunder and lightning. The forecast for the day wasn't great, but rain was not expected to hit until mid morning. For the next ninety minutes, I listened to the cracks and saw the flashes. Should I get up early and break camp, to avoid packing up in what felt like imminent rain?At 5:50 am, I stopped wondering and started packing. I had breakfast amidst the lightning and thunder, and hit the trail at 7:15, with still no rain. I had a 17.7 mile hike planned, climbing to the summit of Apple Orchard Mountain at 4,225 feet, and finishing at Matt's Creek Shelter, elevation 848 feet. A bunch of rain was not going to make the climb and the long descent any easier. At 8:30 am, the long-threatened rain finally arrived, accompanied by heavy winds. This was a big and blustery storm, reminding me of those long ago when so much rain would fall that the school athletic fields would flood, and we would run, leap and slide forever on our stomachs -- an old school Slip 'N Slide. The first bout of heavy rain ran from 8:30 to 10:30, with impressive strikes of thunder and lightning. The summit of Apple Orchard Mountain was an open field, and, as I started to cross the quarter-mile expanse, I felt very exposed. Fortunately, the lightning took a well-deserved break until I reentered the woods on the far side. When the heavy stuff stopped at 10:30, it remained dark, blustery and forboding, and the possibility of more rain hung over the day. Our respite from the storm was brief, and, by 11:00, it was pouring again. As I climbed down into a valley, bolts of lightning from all directions appeared to be in queue, each strike awaiting its appointed turn to flash. The accompanying thunder resounded in various pitches, and rumbled continuously. Mother Nature was starting to flex her muscles. By 1:00 pm, I wondered if the storm had run its course, as the skies were lifting and the rain slowing. But I was wrong -- I hadn't counted on the 2:00 matinee, which featured the heaviest downpours of the day. Despite the conditions, I kept up a credible pace throughout, as I did not want to be hiking too late into the afternoon. When I arrived at the shelter at 3:00, during the height of the 2:00 wave, I was happy to finally put a roof over my head. This was the first day in my two months on the trail where it rained from morning to evening. It's now 8:00 pm, and the storm shows no sign of abating. Thunder punctuates the steady din of rain on the shelter's roof. In my sleeping bag, I care not if it rains all night. I'd just prefer that it stops by morning.","Cornelius Creek Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539718,"AT hikers don't mind getting wet. In fact, it comes with the territory. It's the not getting dry part that is the bigger pain. Last night, it finally stopped raining around midnight. Everything that was exposed to yesterday's storm was soaked, especially shoes, socks, and hiking shirt and shorts. Fortunately, the stuff inside the pack (sleeping bag, camp clothes, down jacket) was bone dry. I awoke to cloudy skies, but no rain. Putting on wet hiking clothing is never a fun thing, but at least it was fairly warm. Setting out to hike, I followed the James River for a mile. Swollen with all of the recent rainfall, the river was muddy brown and debris-laden (photo).Today's hike, 17.2 miles' worth, didn't appear to be that onerous. Yes, there was a climb of 2,700 feet, only to immediately descend 2,400 feet, but, heck, this is the AT and that's just part of the game. If the weather would just cooperate and offer some sunshine, then much that was wet would have a chance to dry out on the hike, and the day might just be enjoyable. Wishful thinking. What I got instead was on and off rain showers from morning to mid-afternoon. There were a few tantalizing peeks of sun, but, for the most part, it was a frustrating day of staying wet. Around 3:00, the sun finally did come out and, when I arrived at my campsite around 4:30, I put everything out to dry. Camping alongside a creek at the bottom of my 2,300 foot descent, I soon watched the sun dive behind the trees, but even in just an hour's time, things went from soaked to wet, a definite improvement. In the end, it doesn't matter much this time around since I'm staying tomorrow night at a hostel, and will get my hiking clothes washed. Still, it'd be nice if the sun would make an appearance tomorrow and dry things out naturally. I am now camped at Mile 799.3, and tomorrow morning I will quickly hike past the 800 mile mark. With that, Harper's Ferry, at Mile 1,022, comes into clearer focus, and the prospect of my finishing the first one thousand miles of my journey finally seems real.","Matt's Creek Shelter

I've done my laundry, emptied my pack to let its contents air-dry, hung out my tent, and slipped in a second lunch of a barbecued pork sandwich. I've also picked up my food resupply box from Alison and repacked it in my waterproof food bag, found waiting for me the new hiking shoes that I ordered, and exchanged their factory shoe laces and insoles with my indestructible Lawson shoe laces and my blue SuperFeet insoles. All of that within a matter of two hours. My first pair of hiking shoes, North Face Ultra Fastpacks, had on them the 812 miles of the AT that I have thus far hiked, plus another hundred, possibly two hundred, miles that I walked in preparation for the trek. It's sad to see something go that has treated me so well, but it's time. I purchased the same shoes to replace them. Today's hike was a strenuous one, despite its relatively short 13.1 mile length. After a nice, flat, three-mile warm-up, I tackled Bald Knob. The AT gained 3,000 feet in elevation to achieve its summit, then immediately dropped 600 feet, only to reclaim that same 600 feet on its way up and over Cole Mountain. There was no rain today, just a lot of perspiration as I worked hard. There was absolutely a grand pay-off, though, as the summit of Cole Mountain was maintained as meadow, and the grasses were long and luscious (photo). Before fog rolled in to consume my perch, I sat on a mountaintop rock and had lunch, talking with four students I had just met from the University of Virginia out for a day hike. My regards to Paxton, now forever Pink, and her fellow Wahoos. Once I hiked down from the summit, I was met at Hog Camp Gap by Marsha of Three Springs Hostel.

When I originally laid out my schedule to get to Waynesboro, on Monday I was going to descend 3,000 feet from the summit of The Priest and then immediately ascend the same 3,000 feet to the summit of Three Ridges Mountain, making for a very tough day. Instead, Oma thought it would be a better idea if I descended down from The Priest today, making it a longer, 18.9 mile day, but saving myself from a hellacious Monday.The day was long, but worth it. I ended up camping beside Cripple Creek, in a less-than-ideal pitch, but was happy to have made it almost to the bottom of the descent off of The Priest.Tomorrow, I begin my day with the last major climb in Virginia, that of Three Ridges Mountain.","Hog Camp Gap (Three Springs Hostel)

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540103,"I have run out of words to describe how hard it has rained at times. From the heavy rain I encountered in the Smokeys, to the storm that Fritz, Brian and I, withstood on the flank of Mt. Rogers, to the drenching I took on the way up to Brush Mountain and its Audie Murphy memorial, and finally to the recent 18-hour pounding that led to the numerous deaths in West Virginia, I swear that each has been a storm of biblical proportions, and I couldn't possibly comprehend of it raining any harder. And, then, there was today. But, I get ahead of myself.The day started out on the rough side. Because of a poor pitch near Cripple Creek, I didn't sleep all that well, and I arose this morning somewhat tired to begin with. The 3,000 foot climb up Three Ridges Mountain that began my hike was as long and strenuous as advertised, and I was happy to get to the top and take a well-earned rest. But, even with the rest, I didn't bounce back as I had hoped, and the rest of the day was ""trudgery"", as I continued to finish off miles, but it was both physically and mentally taxing. I ended up willing my way through 15.7 miles, and, at 4:00, was very ready to find a spot to erect my tent and call it a day.It had drizzled a little bit here and there all day, just enough to make the many rocks littering the trail wet, and the footing a bit treacherous. But I had heard only a few thunder rumbles, and didn't give much thought to any late afternoon storms.I had two possible choices for a camping location. The first, at 15.7 miles for the day, was near a spring, but I was a bit dismayed at the strength of the flow, and decided to hike on a bit farther, to 16.0 miles, to see if the flow at the next spring was better. If it was, I planned to fill up on water and hike onto a good campsite at 17.7 miles. If it wasn't, I'd probably return to the first campsite and spring and make due.So, on my short journey between the springs at 15.7 and 16.0 miles, I was a bit surprised when, out of nowhere, it started raining. As far as I can remember, there were no thunder-filled warnings, no rising winds, no clouds of darkness. It seemed to just start raining. Hard.I had my umbrella out, and decided to simply stand under it, staying as dry as possible until, I assumed, this brief storm would run its course. Ten, twenty, thirty minutes....all passed, and not only wasn't there a let-up, there was increasing intensity throughout. The rain was coming down in sheets, and I had to laugh when the second spring, at 16.0 miles, turned to brown from all the run-off. Without a better idea, I turned around and headed back to the campsite at 15.7 miles. By now, I was totally soaked below my shoulders, but, since there wasn't any wind to speak of, I was somewhat warm. I couldn't pitch my tent yet -- any effort in this rain would simply yield a wet mess, so I prepared by picking out the best spot to pitch and again waited for the rain to abate.Now, however, the wind began to rise, the lightning and thunder became even more severe, and there was so much water cascading about on the ground that I really began to wonder if I was doing the right thing. I'm not sure what an alternate plan might look like, but I was slowly becoming worried that if I continued to stand there, with the wind picking up steam, I'd quickly become chilled. At this point, I slipped off my backpack, which had been protected somewhat by my umbrella, and wrestled on my rain shell, not so much to keep me dry (ha!), but to keep me a bit warmer.How hard was it raining? It was raining so hard that I truly believe it was coming THROUGH my umbrella. I was getting cold drips down my neck, something that I can't explain.The storm, its lightning, thunder and sheets of rain, carried on for a full ninety minutes. I stood through it all. When it finally slowed to something at least manageable, I awkwardly threw up my tent, left those things already too wet to care about outside, and maneuvered into my long underwear, down booties, fleece and sleeping bag as quickly as I could. Everything I needed to get me warm was thankfully dry. I ate peanut butter and tortillas for dinner in my tent, not ready or willing to go through the process of boiling water. The rest of the night passed uneventfully.Not as long and sustained as the West Virginia storm, this one, I believe, was more violent at its height. It was pure Bo Jackson: short-lived, but explosive in its power, brilliant in its artistry and dazzling in its command of the stage. The only casualty? My cell phone, which, I didn't realize until too late, was in my hip belt pocket, unprotected by its plastic bag. I have been unable to start it back up, and I may have to go through the next ten days without it.","Cripple Creek

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540990,"For the past six days, from Rockfish Gap near Waynesboro, VA, to US 522 outside of Front Royal, VA, I have hiked through the Shenandoah National Park (SNP). Using a library computer here in Front Royal, I will recap my trip through SNP.For roughly 103 miles, the AT runs through SNP. Overlooking the Shenandoah Valley for that entire length, the AT rolls between 2,000 and 4,000 feet, without the significant ups and downs I saw earlier in Virginia. While rocky in some places, the SNP portion was tailor-made for big miles, as many thru-hikers take advantage of the relatively easier terrain to put away huge chunks of mileage. Another distinguishing feature of SNP that makes it unlike any other stretch of the AT is its tourism infrastructure, from lodges, to restaurants to ""waysides"", of which hikers make liberal use. Then, to add to the SNP experience, there are bears galore in the park, one estimate placing the number at 800. Finally, I again hiked through my share of rain, just in case I forgot that I was in Virginia.Before launching into the park, I had the pleasure of having dinner outside of Waynesboro with my good friend, Kevin, who drove down from the DC area. He suggested that we visit the Blue Mountain Brewery, which lies midway between Charlottesville and Waynesboro. An exceptional choice, we sat outside to enjoy a lovely view, listened to an excellent solo singer/guitarist, and had dinner. Thanks, Kevin, for making the two-hour journey, and for a wonderful evening!!!Because the singer was both talented and pulled from a playlist that we liked, Kevin and I recounted for each other the music we listened to growing up. The conversation reinforced for me that the one thing I miss the most from being on the trail (after my family!) is, indeed, music.As I planned out how I wanted to move through the park, I decided to average 20 miles a days over the first three days, and then ratchet down to 16 miles a days over the last three. This made sense from two perspectives. First, it would allow me to spend four of my five nights in the park at shelters, where I could choose to tent or sleep under a roof. And, second, I knew that by week's end, I would begin to tire, and would appreciate the shorter days.As I've witnessed in other parts of Virginia since June 15th, rain played a role during my time in SNP, and I took advantage of the shelters to stay ""inside"" for three of my five nights there. One day, it rained just in the afternoon, another day in the morning, and then again in the afternoon, and, on a third day, it poured from 11:30 am through dinner. But, as is the case if you look hard enough, there was a silver lining (and, in this case, two of them.)At Waynesboro, a large number of the hikers that had surrounded me left the trail to ""aqua-blaze"", meaning that they decided to kayak the Shenandoah River to avoid hiking further in Virginia. (This is one way that hikers deal with the ""Virginia Blues"".) With that crew gone, I instead fell in step with a new group of fellow travelers, a group that I took to immediately and looked forward to seeing each night at the next shelter. Some were section hikers (Bass Pro, Margarita, Ex and Meg), some were NoBos (Zing, Sprinter, Jefe, Twinkletoes, Turtle Goat and Roadrunner), and some were flip-flopping (Deets and Elizabeth). We would cross paths during the days, and congregate at night to share experiences, with almost all staying in the shelters because of the rain. The camaraderie was warm and unhurried. I will miss them as we scatter in the coming days.In addition to new friends, the continuing rain in Virginia has been accompanied by rather moderate temperatures. While I saw a few hot days in southern Virginia, I haven't had to deal with anything approaching ninety degrees in weeks, and I'm not sure it even hit eighty while I was in SNP. The evenings recently have been cool -- on the edge of comfortable for my 55 degree summer sleeping bag. And, on at least one day in SNP, I'm sure it never broke out of the sixties. Northern Virginia has had a run of unseasonably cool weather for late June and early July, and we hikers have been the beneficiaries. (But I'm afraid my luck is coming to a rapid end: as I type, it is now over 90, and the mercury will again top that number in each of my upcoming (and last!) four days of hiking in Virginia.As I mentioned, the restaurants and waysides were an added bonus of hiking in SNP. One day, I had both a welcome breakfast at Big Meadows Lodge, and a wonderful lunch at Skyland Resort with Sprinter, Zing, Jefe and Twinkletoes. Then, on the day it rained from late morning to evening, I took solace in a mocha milkshake that I had over lunch at the Elk Hollow Wayside. Certainly, the added calories from this non-hiker food helped my trek through SNP, but, perhaps more to the point, it was simply a nice change to be able to enjoy a little bit of ""normality"" in SNP.During my time in SNP, I came across at least a half-dozen bears, and probably more. Seeing everything from a cub scurrying up a tree to an adolescent near a parking lot to a mature adult in all its size and glory, I was treated to a very impressive parade. The bears were a bit more used to humans, and not as skittish, as others I've seen, thus giving one some very good opportunities to see them ""up close and personal"".With my arrival in Front Royal, I have now completed 969 miles of the AT, and have just 53 miles left until I reach the Appalachian Trail Conservancy's office in Harper's Ferry on Sunday, which will mark the end of my northbound march. My childhood friend, Rich, is joining me on Saturday to hike the last two days of my journey to Harper's Ferry, and then he will drive me to the Baltimore/Washington airport, where I will catch a flight home to Rhode Island. After a few days there, Alison and I will drive to Maine, and I hope to hike Mt. Katahdin on Friday, July 15th, to continue my AT trek. While in Rhode Island, I have an appointment at the Apple Store and should soon have my phone back in working order. Let's hope that they can recover all the photos that I took throughout June!!","Gravel Springs Hut

I recap those last four days here.With the weather now considerably warmer than it had been over the past few weeks, I left Front Royal after a nice stay at the Quality Inn and hit the trail. I was mucho enthusiastic to be beginning the final stretch of the AT in Virginia. Crossing the border into West Virginia and finishing up in Harper's Ferry would mean that I would soon be home with Alison, and that I would soon be in Maine, ready to start the New England portion of my AT adventure. Planning out my (short) week, I expected to hike 20 miles on the first of the four days, and then 13.5, 11.2 and 8.7 miles to finish up. On Day 2, I would pass the 1,000 mile mark, and, on Day 4, leave Virginia, both significant milestones. And, for the last two days, I would be hiking with my childhood friend, Rich, who lives in Baltimore, and who would be taking me to the airport after we arrived in Harper's Ferry.Leaving Front Royal early in the morning, it was already hot, and I was soon glad to be under tree cover. The temperature in Front Royal that day was expected to hit 95 degrees, but it would be fortunately cooler on the trail. It felt great to be walking again and I made good time climbing out of town. I had hoped to camp near Ashby Gap, twenty miles from Front Royal, where several streams crossed the trail. As I neared the gap, however, I was treated to US 50, a major road crossing, and plenty of traffic noise. Not wanting to listen to that all night, I decided to push on, despite having put in a fairly long day already. Rod Hollow Shelter sat 3.6 miles farther on, and I set my sights on it. This first day out of Front Royal, then, would become my longest on the trail, a total of 23.6 miles, definitely more than I had planned, but appropriate given what I had found as I approached Ashby Gap.The second day, then, I had just 9.9 miles to hike before arriving at Bears Den Hostel, owned by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. A wonderful hostel, I made it there by 12:00, and was reading a James Michener novel when a drenching thunderstorm blew through at 1:00. Very happy to be off the trail and under a porch reading, I reflected on the fact that had I walked just twenty miles the day before, I'd still be on the trail at 1:00, getting wet.The next morning, I had a quick 1/2 mile walk down hill to Snickers Gap, where I met Rich. He and I have known each other since we were twelve years old, and it was wonderful having him by my side as I marched the last nineteen miles over two days to Harper's Ferry. Rich had brought with him turkey sandwiches for lunch, complete with fresh tomatoes and lettuce, and it felt like heaven when we sat down at noon to inhale them. Then, at dinner, he broke out homemade lasagna, which, despite being cold, was the best trail dinner I had had in all of my eighty days on the trail thus far.Our final day into Harper's Ferry was uneventful and went quickly. With his pack considerably lighter without the sandwiches and lasagna, Rich began to get his trail legs and we finished the final 8.7 miles by 11:00 am. When we arrived at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy's office in Harper's Ferry, we were greeted enthusiastically by the staff, and there were a number of other hikers there, celebrating their arrival at the psychological halfway point of the AT. (The ATC lies at Mile 1,022, and the true halfway point is 73 miles further north.) I congratulated thru-hikers Sprinter, Zing, Twinkletoes and Deets on their accomplishment, and shared a laugh with Meg, who I had seen at the shelter the night before. I had my photo taken to commemorate my arrival, and Rich and I posed together for posterity's sake (above). After a quick shower at Harper's Ferry Hostel, we were off to the airport, where I grabbed my flight to Rhode Island.Alison was waiting for me as I arrived, and our reunion was too welcome for words. It feels somewhat surreal to be back home and, knowing that I return to the trail in a few short days, it all feels like a movie set, very temporary in nature. While I have a lot to do in the upcoming days, Alison and I will do our best to slow down the time and catch up. We have a long drive ahead of us to Katahdin, but already I am vibrating with excitement. Despite all the time I have spent in Maine, I have never climbed Katahdin (or Mt. Washington!), and I am really looking forward to being back in New England and continuing my journey.With my new phone(!) now under a waterproof case, thanks to the thoughtfulness of my friend, McLane, I am ready to tackle the second half of the AT.","David Lesser Memorial Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542285,"Katahdin! Out of our room at 5 Lakes Lodge, I am watching the final minutes of sunset. Katahdin looms in the dimming light, massive and majestic. Clouds ring the summit halo-like. In the gathering darkness, the mountain takes the day's final bow to a loon's call.It was a stupendous day. Memorable. Physical. Intimidating. Powerful. Katahdin, the highest mountain in Maine, rises to 5,267 feet, and the AT climbs 4,150 feet in its run to the summit, the largest elevation gain on the entire trail. The mountain is a study in contrasts. The trails that cling to its sides are incredibly steep and heavily bouldered. But the summit, Baxter Peak, sits on one end of the beautiful Tablelands, a long, wide and gentle plateau that caps the mountain. And while Katahdin massively dominates the horizon, the Knife Edge, the ridge trail that connects Pamola, South and Baxter Peaks, is sharp, spiny and narrow. At the other end of the Tablelands, the AT emerges from a rough and tumble boulder field, winding its way past the serene Thoreau Spring and on to the summit.Baxter State Park, home to Katahdin, lies fifteen miles from Millinocket, the nearest town. The town's weather forecast for today was promising: partly cloudy, mid-eighties, gentle breezes and no rain. Of course, conditions on the mountain could be drastically different, but I remained hopeful as Alison drove me to the park and dropped me off at Roaring Brook Campground, where I would start my day on the Helon Taylor Trail. At 7:30 am, I was hiking. But as I soon found out, there is very little ""hiking"" on Katahdin. Instead, one climbs. A lot. Hand over hand, often above one's head. The Helon Taylor trail climbs to the top of the 4,900-foot Pamola Peak and provides stunning views to the east. More important, it will deliver me to the beginning of the Knife Edge, both a ridge and a trail, which connects Pamola Peak to Baxter Peak, the summit of Katahdin. As I climbed Helon Taylor, I reached a ceiling of clouds and fog, the temperatures dropped and the winds picked up. My optimism for blue skies and clear views was eroding. I had long packed away my hiking poles; it was simply too steep for them to be of any help. I was now well above tree line, with boulders and rocks covering every inch of the mountain. Two young women I met at the park office yesterday passed me on their way down. They had reached Pamola Peak and turned around due to vicious winds. They decided not to proceed onto the Knife Edge in such conditions. But I still had an hour of climbing on Helon Taylor and hoped for a different reality when I reached Pamola. I arrived on top just behind a fellow hiker. He decided to wait for a bit, not so much for the winds, which indeed had weakened somewhat, but because he hoped that the ceiling might lift to reveal the Knife Edge and its surrounding peaks in all their glory. I chose not to wait, thinking that that might be inviting worse conditions. I climbed down off of Pamola onto Knife Edge and started the 1.1 mile journey to Baxter Peak. Nothing I will now write will do Knife Edge justice. It was like climbing across the spine of a stegosaurus: sharp, jagged, and thousand-foot drops on each side. It was not so much a trail as a collection of boulders, strewn on top of a razor-thin ridge, mangled into place by gravity. The ridge was no more than two or three feet wide in places, and the gusting winds and steep drop-offs caused me to focus on keeping three points of contact at all times. The ceiling of clouds and fog enveloped the ridge, and any views existed only for seconds at a time. A heavy mist soon soaked my hair and my glasses became useless. I removed them halfway across, and relied on my uncorrected vision. A father and daughter preceded me across the ridge (photo), and I intently watched them maneuver among the boulders. It took me 90 minutes to move one mile across Knife Edge, which steadily climbed 400 feet as it approached Baxter Peak. I was never scared. Rather, I was on high alert. The footing was precarious and the wind would gust from time to time, requiring that I maintain good hold. I felt wholly alive. The Knife Edge finally released me onto Baxter Peak, where other of Katahdin's trails had delivered a few hikers. With celebratory photos taken in the wind, mist and fog, I found the familiar white blazes of the AT leading off of the summit and headed off across the Tablelands, thus starting my journey south on the trail, ultimately back to Harper's Ferry. The climb down the AT, also called the Hunt Trail, was difficult. The boulder field below the Tablelands took hours to negotiate. In the end, I could not tell which of the trails I had taken today was the easiest. There simply wasn't anything that remotely approached ""easy"". Rather than wait for me at Katahdin Stream Campground, Alison walked up a bit of the AT to surprise me. When I fell into her arms, I had been hiking/climbing for eight hours and was tired, spent and elated. Despite the low ceiling, mist and wind, it had been an exhilarating day, one that I will not forget. Climbing Katahdin was a true challenge and the hairiest thing I had ever done. Today made it clear that I had moved into a new chapter of my trek. I am thrilled to be in Maine.","Summit of Katahdin

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542437,"This morning, Alison dropped me off at Katahdin Stream Campground, where I finished my climb down from Mt. Katahdin the day before. We said our good-byes (again), and I headed south on the AT. I had about nine miles to hike before I would leave the confines of Baxter State Park. Shortly thereafter, I would cross the Abol Bridge that spans the Penobscot River and officially pass into the 100 Mile Wilderness. The 100 Mile Wilderness is the most remote part of the AT. As the name implies, there are no towns, roads or services for 100 miles (save for a logging road or two.) Since I don't expect to find a cell signal either, this may be my last post until I reach Monson, Maine, in six days. As I soon found, the Wilderness is beautiful in a very familiar way. Balsam hangs in the air, moss gently covers rocks and boulders, and the trail is cuddled by fallen pine needles. This is the Maine I so love. Alison and I have a camp on a lake in the western mountains of Maine near Rangelely, where the AT passes within ten miles. In a very real sense, then, I will be hiking ""home"" as I proceed from Baxter State Park, through the 100 Mile Wilderness and into the western mountains that stretch to the New Hampshire border. To make my time in Maine even more special, Alison will be staying here while I hike through, and we will see each other quite often. I also hope to have visits from our children, Sandy and Holly. Today, I covered a total of 13.4 miles over easy terrain, opting to stop at the Hurd Brook Lean-to. I started out feeling fine, but soon realized that yesterday's climb of Katahdin had taken quite a bit out of me. I had no problem ending my hiking day a bit early and relaxing in camp. To add to a pleasant day, I had to ford my first stream today, taking off my hiking shoes, putting on my Crocs and wading in. Water levels are still a bit high and I expect that I will be fording a number of times more before leaving the 100 Mile Wilderness. Over the past two days, I have met three other hikers who flip-flopped after reaching Harper's Ferry, and three folks who are SoBos new to the trail. In camp tonight, there are also four section hikers who are tackling the 100 Mile Wilderness. Thus, any fears I had about being alone as I proceed south are already unfounded. While my experience on Katahdin is still fresh, today's photo from the Abol Bridge captures the full expanse of the mountain without the cloud cover that often obscures its summit.","Katahdin Stream Campground

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542666,"Tonight, I am camped on the shore of Nahmakanta Lake, being serenaded by a couple of bull frogs. I had planned to stop half a mile earlier to stay at a shelter, but heard of this fabulous campsite at lunchtime from two NoBos, and decided to give it a whirl. It was worth the extra half-mile!Leaving Baxter State Park, the AT heads south and then southwest, destined for the New Hampshire border 275 miles away. The trail stays south of both Moosehead and Flagstaff Lakes, but passes through an area of Maine that has many, many lakes, ponds, rivers and streams. For the first fifty miles of the 100 Mile Wilderness heading south, much of the land is low-lying, and the AT is inundated with roots, rocks and mud. As one gets a bit beyond the halfway point of the Wilderness, elevations rise as the trail begins to anticipate the western mountains of Maine.So, today, most of the terrain was quite gentle, closely following the courses of various streams and lakes. There was hardly any elevation change until the trail climbed 850 feet to the top of Nesuntabunt Mountain late in the day (photo). I took advantage of this relative flatness, and, when I added that last half-mile, it pushed my day's total to twenty miles. I'm guessing that that may be my last twenty for a long time to come. Because of the heavily-rooted trail conditions, today's hike took great concentration, as every step mattered. By the end of today's twenty, I was ready for a treat. That treat came in the form of a swim. After pitching my tent and doing my water chores, I took a dip in Nahmakanta Lake. With the lake on the shallow side, the water was warm and pleasurable, in fact, much warmer than anything I encountered in the south!","Hurd Brook Lean-to
",Nahmakanta Lake,"Jul 17, Sun",20
Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542783,"Today was very much like yesterday, although I was happier putting in just 17.4 miles. The terrain continued on the gentle side, with elevations staying between 500 and 650 feet, and I reached my intended tenting spot and began to make camp by 4:00. While other hikers prefer to keep walking through 6:00, 7:00, even 8:00, I like to pitch my tent, unpack and complete my water chores by 5:00. Then, I can relax a bit before dinner and journal writing.   And, like yesterday, I took a dip after finishing my chores, this time in a stream besides my pitched tent. Again, the water was pleasantly warm. With this low-lying terrain and water everywhere you look, one unfortunate trail reality comes to the fore: bugs. In my posts to date, I have not risked uttering this four-letter word in the hope that my luck would continue to hold out. All through the south, I was very pleasantly surprised at the lack of bugs (and, for the most part, lack of heat.) With all the rain we had, I would have expected more of the flying, biting critters. Well, in my first two full days of the 100 Mile Wilderness, Maine is making up for lost time. I've certainly seen it worse, but it's still uncomfortable. Fortunately, it appears that the dreaded black flies have already run their course for the year. However, Air Mosquito has seemingly launched all of its assets, and, with the little buggers looking to refuel, I apparently am considered a ""target rich environment."" There are also these nasty larger flies that can do some real damage, as well as the no-see-ums, but the mosquitos are proving to be the most prolific attackers. In anticipation of the onslaught, I did a few things in preparation. First, before setting out, I sent all of the clothes in which I would be hiking to Insect Shield. This company treats your clothing with Permethrin, but does it in a way that lasts seventy washings, many more times than if you apply Permethrin at home. So far, I have been thrilled at the way my Buff headcover, in particular, has helped keep the bugs at bay. I also purchased a lightweight bug net from Insect Shield, again treated with Permethrin, which I deployed for the first time today. It was fabulous! Cool and easy to see through, it covered my head and neck and thoroughly repelled the bugs.Finally, I chose to bring Picaridin along as my bug spray. A DEET alternative, I primarily use it for my legs, and, so far, it seems to work ""okay.""While each of these has proven to be more or less successful, I have noticed that it really, really helps to simply keep moving. Continuing my Air Mosquito analogy, it seems the fighter squadrons prefer to land on stationary airstrips, not on a pitching and yawing aircraft carrier deck, which is what I must look like to them when I'm in hiker mode. But as soon as I stop, they attack from all angles. This phenomenon makes picking a place for lunch quite critical. Sitting down anywhere just won't do, and, today, I was quite fortunate. Around lunchtime, I found myself at a pond that had a lovely sandy beach, some shade and a good, stiff, breeze, which is the best remedy of all. I sat down for an hour and a half, much longer than usual, and relished the absence of bugs. I am hoping that as the trail gains elevation over the next few days, the bugs will lessen somewhat. But if that proves optimistic, at least I have the tools to defend myself.","Nahmakanta Lake

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542964,"Yesterday, two lines of thunderstorms rolled through the 100 Mile Wilderness. The first landed a glancing blow and amounted to an hour of rain. The second wave missed me altogether but had more of an impact: it brought noticeably cooler, drier air. The result? Hiking conditions today were perfect. Temperatures held in the low to mid-sixties and blue sky was abundant. (Tonight, temperatures will dip into the forties, and will give me a great chance to check out the comfort range of the 35 degree sleeping bag that I bought for the rest of my trip.)As I had anticipated, the AT gained elevation throughout the day. Starting out at 625 feet, I hiked 15.4 miles to Logan Brook Lean-to, climbing to an elevation of 2,386 feet. With the perfect weather, it was an effortless day on the trail. The bugs I detailed at great length yesterday were nowhere to be found due to the cool temperatures and higher elevations, the trail gained altitude in moderate grades, and a cool Maine summer breeze blew all day. Tonight, I've met a great group of SoBos at the lean-to, adding to the number of people I now know heading south. We all seem to be hiking at different paces, so you never know who will be at the next lean-to. (The structures called shelters in Georgia and North Carolina, and huts in the Shenandoahs, are called lean-to's in Maine.)Today, I took advantage of a totally helpful service provided by a hostel in Millinocket. The AT Lodge makes a daily run to the halfway point of the 100 Mile Wilderness to drop food to hikers so interested, thus negating the need for those hikers to start out from Katahdin with seven or eight days of food. When I left Baxter State Park, I carried just four days of food, and today picked up my food drop of four more days' worth. And, because I plan to finish my trek through the 100 Mile Wilderness in seven days, I was able to help out Happy, a new hiker attempting a thru-hike SoBo, by giving her my extra day's worth of food. She was one happy camper. When I arrived in Harper's Ferry back on July 10th, I reached the ""psychological"" halfway point of the AT. Within the first mile of my hike tomorrow, I will pass 1,094.6 miles, the actual halfway point of my hike. Now, that will be cool.","Jo-Mary Road

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543181,"Last night, the temperature dipped well into the forties at Logan Brook Lean-to. I tented fairly close to the mountain brook, and that made it feel even cooler. My new sleeping bag did admirably, but I learned that I need to retrieve my long underwear, which I had removed from my pack for Virginia. As the morning moved along, I was treated to another perfect hiking day. Cool, crisp, comfortable, cloudless and critter-less. I started the day off by summiting Whitecap Mountain, at 3,650 feet, the first significant peak since Mt. Katahdin. Views were outstanding and reinforced just how remote the 100 Mile Wilderness really is. Mountains and lakes, and more mountains and lakes. Purely, beautifully, Maine. I managed to put in 17.1 miles for the day, finishing by climbing Chairback Mountain, the first peak of the Chairback Range when one is heading south. Tonight, I am in my tent at Chairback Gap Lean-to, a spectacularly-sited shelter built into the side of a rather steep mountainside. My tent sits on a ledge that must be home to two red squirrels, given the racket they are making. I had to get creative in pitching my tent, for the ledge is barely wide enough to accommodate me. Since the cool front moved in Monday night, I have been treated to two of those quintessentially Maine days, days that make you realize just how lucky you are to be alive. The kicker? I get to hike all day. Incredible.","Logan Brook Lean-to

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543186,"The Chairback Range comprises six peaks, and none exceeds 2,700 feet in elevation. It would be incredibly easy to underestimate the difficulty in crossing the range. In fact, I did. Leaving bright and early at 7:00 am, I was caught off-guard by the short, but incredibly steep climbs that I had to navigate. Particularly on Fourth Mountain, the trail seemed to turn nearly vertical. The Chairback Range is not unusual in this regard. Throughout Maine and New Hampshire, trail designers opted to employ switchbacks rather sparingly, instead choosing to run trails more directly up the mountains. This is the biggest difference that I've noted so far from the trails I experienced in Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. There, trails had a more moderate grade due to extensive use of switchbacks. The good news is that I much prefer going uphill. I have developed a pacing technique combining rhythmic breathing and hiking pole placement that allows me to tackle the steep climbs in a very focused way. Employing this technique, I am
never out of breath and always under control. Now, if I could only transfer this learning to other aspects of my life....This past winter, much of Maine saw snowfalls well below average, and rains this spring and summer seem to be behind historical levels, too. While the rivers and bigger streams seem to have ample water, smaller streams and springs are already drying up. In fact, several lean-to's have been without water in recent days. And, I've had to remove my hiking shoes and wade across just two rivers so far, as all the others I have come across could be forded by rock hopping. I continue to meet more SoBos and those, like me, who flip-flopped. The crew of hikers that is now moving south with me is an excellent bunch. This is a very welcome development!","Chairback Gap Lean-to

The first half of today's 9.7 miles was tougher than expected, again. Luckily, the second half proved to be a bit easier, and I made it to Route 15 just before noon. As has happened repeatedly on my trek, I limped to the finish line, drained from eight straight days of hiking, some of it quite strenuous. I am now convinced, however, that there is no magic number of hiking days or miles that I have in me between zeroes. Instead, there is most definitely some mind/body collusion going on. As long as I have additional days to hike, my mind and body react positively, and I keep moving through those days, feeling energetic and motivated. But as soon as that last day rolls around, and I know that I am entering a town or about to take a zero, my energy flags and I arrive worn out. It's as if will and determination are in control until the last day, when they yield to the reality of exhaustion. I just loved my time in the 100 Mile Wilderness, no doubt aided by the terrific weather we had. While it briefly rained this morning, the rest of the day was sun-filled, and by the time noon rolled around, it was actually pretty hot. During my seven days in the Wilderness, it probably rained a total of two hours, making my trek through more enjoyable. But I realize that Maine, and the AT's water sources, could use a big infusion of rain. Alison was at the trailhead to meet me, and we drove back to our camp in the Rangeley Lakes together, where I will zero tomorrow.

They've had one hundred miles or less to go. Thus far, the NoBos have fallen into two categories. The first grouping has their heads down, say hello, but are clearly focused elsewhere. They are at the stage where, after 2,100 miles of hiking, they need or want their journey to be finished, and aren't really in a place to start up a conversation. The second category of hikers is a bit more fun to pass. They are clearly ecstatic, very willing to share their happiness and often get misty-eyed just thinking about their soon-to-be realized accomplishment.After hiking 1,100 miles myself, I thoroughly get both attitudes. The AT is a long trek, physically, mentally and emotionally. It can be exhilarating and draining in the same day. I can only imagine how much harder it will get as I move into the Maine mountains and New Hampshire's Presidential Range, and then have to hike another 700 miles to finish.Still, I'd like to believe that I will find myself in the second of the two categories.

Thus, the rest of this week will be about making sure that I am in proper position to meet with him that day. Today, with its 18.8 miles hiked, was my last big mileage day for weeks to come. With good weather again, I made quick work of the morning climb up Bald Mountain, elevation 2,629 feet. The afternoon's ascent of Pleasant Pond Mountain, elevation 2,470, was a little less satisfying as my legs began to tire, but both summits yielded great views of the mountains to west and north. With the 37 miles I put in over the past two days, I will now begin to back down my daily mileage. Starting on Wednesday, the terrain will be getting tougher, as the trail crosses, in short order, the following mountains of western Maine: the Bigelow Range, the Crockers and Spaulding Mountain, the Saddleback Range, Bemis and Old Blue Mountains, the Baldpates and the Mahoosuc Range. This Thursday, I will summit the peaks of the Bigelow Range (photo, left side), climbing above 4,000 feet for the first time since Katahdin. From the Bigelows through the remainder of Maine and into New Hampshire, the terrain turns sharply more difficult, certainly the hardest stretch on the AT. Despite the fact that I have now hiked almost 1,200 miles, I am apprehensive about the next 250 miles. The climbs and descents are devishly steep, and, in poor weather, can be downright treacherous. I will have to manage my food well to reduce its impact on my pack weight, since a lighter pack will make all the difference in the world in battling this terrain. In a way, all that I have hiked thus far is just warm-up for western Maine and New Hampshire. This week, the AT begins in earnest.

When that daily water pulse occurs, the river rises very rapidly, and the force of its current increases dramatically.Not surprisingly, then, fording the Kennebec is very dangerous, and the Appalachian Trail Conservency and the Maine Appalachian Trail Club therefore cooperate to provide a free ferry service by canoe for hikers. The canoe crossing is the ""official"" way to ford the Kennebec, and white blazes are taped to the canoe's floor. AJ, a SoBo that Alison and I met before I summited Katahdin, also stayed at the Caratunk B&B. After breakfast, he and I made our way down the AT to the ferry landing and waited for the morning's first canoe crossing at 9:00 am. Greg, the ferry operator, promptly showed a minute or two after nine, and paddled AJ and me across the Kennebec. Today's photo shows Greg returning to the east bank, from where we came. AJ and I then resumed our hike from the west bank of the Kennebec under another gorgeous Maine day, ultimately putting in 14 miles to the West Carry Pond Lean-to. The trail, for one last day, rolled along with very little elevation gain, but again was dominated by roots and rocks, adding several degrees of difficulty to its navigation. I was happy to arrive at camp at 4:00 pm. The 37 miles I had covered in the previous two days, along with my 3:30 am wake-up call when we drove from our camp to Monson, had taken a bit out of me and I needed the downtime and sleep. Tomorrow, the western mountains of Maine begin. It's game time.","US 201 (Caratunk, ME)

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543745,"Under another brilliant blue sky, I left the West Carry Pond Lean-to, bound for the Bigelow Range. Comprising five peaks (Little Bigelow, Avery, West Bigelow, The Horns and Cranberry Peak), the Bigelow Range is typically noted among hikers' favorites. Featuring granite-covered peaks rising above tree line, the range is oft-photographed and offers fabulous views of the surrounding western mountains of Maine. With elevations increasing, and steep climbs the norm, I am consciously reducing my daily mileage. Today, I planned to hike 12.6 miles, summiting Little Bigelow, and spending the night at Safford Notch Campsite. The climb up Little Bigelow, topping out at 3,070 feet, was not terribly tough, and I arrived at my intended campsite at 2:30 pm. With my body feeling the effects of the 177 miles of Maine roots and rocks I had so far crossed, I was not at all disappointed with the prospect of ending so early. But a check of tomorrow's weather gave me pause. With thundershowers expected by late morning, I contemplated continuing on another two miles to summit Avery Peak so that I might traverse the remaining Bigelows in the morning and get down off the ridge before the rain set in and footing became more difficult. There were three issues with that new strategy. First, the two-mile climb of Avery Peak is substantially steep, and I would be tackling it at 2:30 in the afternoon after a good day of hiking. Second, I didn't necessarily want to rush through the Bigelows, as I had never climbed them before and wanted to enjoy the experience. Third, I was still tired from the week's hiking, and I knew it would be a tough climb. After paying close attention to my body and weighing the pros and cons, I decided to indeed stay at Safford Notch. In the end, I was simply too tired to confidently push on. Time will tell whether I made the right decision. From the top of Little Bigelow, the twin summits of Avery and West Peaks are just stunning (photo). I look forward to climbing both tomorrow, planning to get a very early start to see if I can beat the worst of the weather. In the course of today's hike, I passed the 1,200 mile mark. More interestingly, I now have less than 1,000 miles to go! I do realize that that's a long way, but knowing that I am ""just"" 989 miles from finishing sure sounds like I'm making progress.","West Carry Pond Lean-to

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543859,"With the weather forecast still promising late morning thundershowers, I decided before bed to set an alarm for 4:00 am with the goal of hiking by 5:00. I could then make it across a substantial section of the Bigelows before any rain moved in. Given the steepness of the ascents and descents, rain water would not be my friend. Wearing a headlamp to aid the emerging dawn, I set off to climb Avery Peak, at 4,090 feet, the second-highest of the Bigelows. The trail rose 1,800 feet from my campsite to Avery Peak's summit in less than two miles of hiking. Despite the steep ascent, I made quick work of the climb and was standing on top by 6:20 am. To say the least, the 360 degree view was stunning, particularly looking north and east, over Flagstaff Lake (photo). I had the whole place to myself and reveled in the widening daylight. The breeze was moderate and somewhat cooling, so I didn't want to stay too long; besides, I had two more significant Bigelow peaks to climb. I moved down off of Avery Peak, and headed for West Peak, the highest of the Bigelows at 4,150 feet. Again having the summit all to myself, I drank in the beauty of Maine. While on West Peak, I checked the weather forecast to find that the threat of thundershowers had been pushed out to 1:00 pm. Checking the trail map, I confirmed that I would be completely off the mountain by then and probably enjoying lunch in nearby Stratton, ME. So, my plan, developed with much angst, to spend the previous night at Safford Notch and then to arise early, seemed to be a winning ticket. And I still had time in the alpine zone to enjoy West Peak and all of Maine spreading out below me. After visiting The Horns, the next and last of the major Bigelow peaks, it was time to tackle the 2,500 foot descent. The constant pounding of stepping steeply downhill, combined with the need to arrest my descent, quickly lead to tired legs, especially after three significant ascents. But I moved down off the mountain in good form, and was soon hitchhiking into Stratton in time for lunch. After hearing so much over the years about the Bigelow Range, I am happy to say that it did not disappoint....at all. I loved the climbs, adored the rewarding views, and was thrilled to be alone on the summits. After Alison dropped me off in Monson five days ago, she returned to Rhode Island and reappears in Maine tomorrow, with our children, Sandy and Holly. Sandy is coming up to hike with me tomorrow afternoon and Saturday, and I hope to day hike with Alison and Holly at some point over the next week.","Safford Notch Campsite

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544088,"With Alison, Sandy, and Holly set to arrive in Maine around noon, I took the opportunity to spend the morning climbing North and South Crocker, both mountains higher than 4,000 feet, but neither above tree line. From my starting point at Route 27, the climb up North Crocker was somewhat long and gradual, making the 2,800 foot gain in altitude feel less significant. The trail condition was quite good, and the weather again cooperative, making the morning hike easy and pleasurable. Descending off of North Crocker, and on toward South Crocker, I caught some great views of Sugarloaf Mountain and its ski area. After summiting South Crocker, I began the hike down towards Caribou Valley Road, where I was to be picked up by a shuttle driver and taken to Rangeley to meet my family for lunch. Excited by the upcoming reunion, I skipped down the very steep trail, probably going faster than I should, but incapable of slowing down. Knowing that Sandy could only spend one night with me on the trail, I picked a section of the AT where we could get on and off easily. This afternoon, we hiked 3.8 miles from ME Route 17 to Sabbath Day Pond Lean-to, and tomorrow, we'll walk the remaining 9.4 miles out to ME Route 4. After arriving at Sabbath Day Pond Lean-to around 5:00 pm, Sandy and I looked to immediately set up our tents, but it was more difficult than usual. The whole campsite was already packed with two large hiking groups, one from a girls' camp in Maine, the other from a boys' camp, leaving little space for others to set up their tents. I literally found the last available tent site, while Sandy, with his freestanding tent, was able to claim the only tent platform. With 6:00 pm quickly closing in, we then took a heavenly swim at a close-by pond that featured a sandy beach and bottom. After completing all the trail chores together, we cooked dinner and talked with a couple of thru-hikers who were staying in the shelter, giving Sandy a pretty good taste of life on the trail. Sandy is now 23, and living on his own in San Francisco. Time alone with him is becoming more rare. I am so grateful that he could find two days to come all the way to Maine to hike with me. We talked extensively while we hiked, and I relished the evening spent in his company once in camp. I'd like to believe that he enjoyed our time together as much as his proud father did.","ME Route 27

We planned to hike the 9.4 miles to Route 4 in the morning and then get back to our camp so that Sandy could at least enjoy one afternoon and evening there before heading back to California. Despite this morning's stretch of the AT being quite close to our camp, I had never hiked it, thinking, I suppose, that since it lacked any significant climb, it couldn't be that interesting. Well, lesson learned. It was beautiful! It passed several different lakes and ponds, rose 500 feet through lovely spruce forest, and was more varied in its terrain than I expected. It was a perfect section of the AT for Sandy and me to tackle in his short stay. For Sandy, it was quite a contrast to the hiking he had recently done in California. This morning, he was reacquainted with the beauty of the deep Maine woods, its sights, fragrances and its plentiful water. For me, it was more opportunity to enjoy my son's company, reminisce with him about past years, and catch up on his recent life.

No matter how you count it, an incredible stretch of northern New England weather!After my birthday zero yesterday, Alison dropped me off this morning at Caribou Valley Road, the place I left the trail to go meet up with Sandy. The section that I walked with him had left 24 miles in between unhiked, and I planned to cover the first thirteen of those today, and the remaining eleven tomorrow. Today's hike started off with a sharp ascent that ultimately led to the shoulder of Spaulding Mountain, just shy of 4,000 feet. After dropping down to 1,550 feet to cross the Orbeton River, I regained 1,400 feet to reach the Poplar Ridge Lean-to at 2,948 feet.

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544505,"The rain stopped by 10:00 pm, leaving much of the night to start drying things out. By the time I began hiking at 8:00 am, the trail was still a bit wet, but ready for the day to wring it fully dry. With fluffy white clouds replacing the evening's stormy ones, the day held ideal hiking conditions: intermittent sun, a brisk breeze and pleasant temperatures. Last night's Poplar Ridge Lean-to sat just shy of 3,000 feet, so my ascent to the first of the three Saddleback peaks, Saddleback Junior, went by fairly quickly. At 3,655 feet, Saddleback Junior isn't particularly high, but its summit is fully above tree line and offered tremendous views. There, I met a couple from New Zealand, Cow Pie and Dusty, who have a future at the New Zealand Tourism Council. By the time I stepped off the summit to head to the next peak, I was ready to sign up for three weeks of hiking in New Zealand and Australia. Next in line, The Horn rises to 4,021 feet after a steep climb from the notch between it and Saddleback Junior. Very rocky, with long, large slabs of bedrock, the trail up took some real effort. But once at the top, hikers are offered a true alpine treat. For the 1.5 miles between the summits of The Horn and the adjoining Saddleback Mountain, the AT stays entirely above tree line. Granite bedrock and boulders host the trail and cairns mark its serpentine progress toward Saddleback Mountain's 4,120 foot summit. With alpine flora stubbornly clinging to the exposed rock and breathtaking views in all directions, the mile and a half walk was an utter delight. Before I left to climb the Saddleback Range, I had arranged with Alison and Holly to meet me at the summit of Saddleback at noon. They would embark from the parking lot at ME Route 4 and climb 2,500 feet over 5.7 miles, a significant day hike. I arrived at Saddleback's summit from The Horn at 11:30 am, donned a light fleece and shell, and thoroughly enjoyed passing the 25 minutes until their on-time arrival. With a stiff breeze blowing, we ate lunch, took in the views, stood for today's photo, and rested before our long descent back down to the parking lot. I loved having Holly by my side, sharing a small part of my AT adventure, as we moved from above tree line to below. A college sophomore, astute and highly attuned to others, Holly is a real force for good. On the way down, I had the pleasure of running into two NoBos that I had met outside of Hiawassee, GA, in late April. Rattle Bee and Banana Pants, very seasoned and fast-moving hikers, broke into wide smiles when they recognized my trail name, and couldn't have been more genuine in their delight to see a flip-flopper from their early AT days. We spoke for a bit, I introduced them to Alison and Holly, and we all drank in their very pleasant company. These two had made quite an impression on this rookie thru-hiker way back in Hiawassee, and I couldn't have been more happy than to see them again. They had just 215 miles to go, and will finish the AT in under four months.Arriving back at our camp at 5:00 pm, we all agreed it was a wonderful day, and I'm thrilled that Alison and Holly had the chance to join me on the AT.

The hardest part heading south is the last twenty miles of that, and I wanted to get after it. But first, I needed to do the 26 miles preceding that last twenty, and that would take me today and tomorrow. Today's hike featured a sharp ascent at the beginning, and a very sharp descent at the end. In between, I climbed two mountains, Bemis and Old Blue(!), both around 3,600 feet, and neither particularly difficult or noteworthy. All in all, the 13.2 miles I hiked today was fairly non-descript. The number of NoBos I am passing each day is increasing. My sense is that I will encounter the ""bubble"" of NoBos, the largest concentration, in the White Mountains. At the same time, I seem to be behind the biggest wave of SoBos. It will be interesting to see if I catch up to them. With just three days left in Maine, the weather continues to be incredibly advantageous for thru-hikers.

Up, down, up, down, up, down. By the end of the day, I had climbed a total of 4,400 feet, and descended 3,600. It was like a roller coaster; every time I came to the top of something, I was quickly thrown back down, only to have to climb again. The three ""mountains"" I climbed I had never heard of. Moody, Hall and Wyman. None exceeded 3,000 feet, but each was preceded by a notch, Black Brook, Sawyer and Dunn, from which I had to climb. Looking on the bright side, today got me ready for tomorrow. I'll be climbing East Baldpate (photo), West Baldpate and Old Speck, and, if I hold out, I hope to descend Mahoosuc Arm. While tomorrow's mountains are taller than today's trio, the vertical gained and lost throughout the day is almost the same. During this past week, I took a couple of zeroes and hiked a few ten mile days so that I could spend time with my family. It's been 106 days since I left on this adventure and they have all been so supportive. Still, having your husband/father gone that long cannot be easy (it's sure not easy on me!), and I'm so glad that I slowed down and took the time to see them. Alison and I had set the dates that I would be with the family pretty far in advance (which required some major guessing about my hiking pace), and I'm glad to say that all worked out. Now, though, it's time to kick it into high gear. I'll be crossing into New Hampshire on Sunday, assuming the weather cooperates.

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544897,"Today, I proved to myself that I'm probably as ready for the White Mountains as I will ever be. Starting from Frye Notch, I ascended East and West Baldpate, descended into Grafton Notch, climbed Old Speck, and finished the day off by descending Mahoosuc Arm. Tonight, I am camping at the base of Mahoosuc Arm, just before the AT enters Mahoosuc Notch. As an indication of how significant the terrain was today, it took me 9.5 hours to hike 12.8 miles, by far the ""slowest"" I have walked on my AT trek. The climbs up East Baldpate and Old Speck were steep, and the descent of Mahoosuc Arm was even steeper, likely the most demanding climb down I have thus far made. On this, my last full day in Maine, the weather had a few surprises for me. First, I awoke at 4:30 am to an hour's worth of rain that made my morning climb of East Baldpate slightly more difficult. Then, just as I was minutes from the top, the partly sunny skies gave way to a fog bank that enveloped the summits of both East and West Baldpate. With visibility quite low, the alpine zone cairns capably led me off the summits and down into more hospitable conditions. Then, in the early afternoon, when I approached the summit of Old Speck, again the clouds closed in, robbing me of blue sky, but offering me quite a view nonetheless (photo). Finally, just as I was about to descend Mahoosuc Arm in the afternoon, a ten-minute passing shower made the steep trail both steep and wet. This was the eventuality with which I was most concerned. I had heard time and time again that I did not want to descend Mahoosuc Arm in the rain, and now I was confronted with that reality. I had left the closest campground thirty minutes earlier under a brightening sky, and I had checked the weather to see that rain was not expected. I therefore thought I was in the clear as I stopped to take some photos of an alpine meadow atop Mahoosuc Arm. But just as I was putting away my phone, the sky turned dark and the short shower hit. Now what?Having stowed my umbrella, sun and blue sky quickly returned, and it seemed rather possible that the rain was over for the day. From where I stood, it was thirty minutes back to the last campground, or literally a minute or two the other way to start the descent. I decided to try my luck. Mahoosuc Arm would have been tough under any conditions. With the trail passing over large slabs of granite angled at ridiculously steep grades, one had to place each footfall with utmost care. Yes, the wet rock made it more difficult, but at least the rain had stopped, and I had left myself plenty of time to descend. Concentrating hard and moving quite slowly, I descended the one and a half miles in two hours. I never felt in danger or out of control, and I'm glad I made the decision to climb down. As a result, I begin tomorrow with Mahoosuc Notch, perhaps the most famous mile of the AT among thru-hikers. The Notch sits between two mountains which, over the millennia, have liberally shed boulders from their flanks. Gravity has assembled those boulders into a maze at the bottom of the Notch, and the AT moves through it for one mile. This one mile is referred to as both the AT's hardest mile and the AT's most fun mile. One climbs over, under, in between and through this jumble of boulders,making it like no other section of the AT. Every thru-hiker looks forward to it. Not every thru-hiker enjoys it. I'll be interested to see where I fall. From the moment I started planning my trek, Mahoosuc Arm, Mahoosuc Notch and the White Mountains have been focal points. All the trail literature treats them as the stuff of dreams. I'm so excited to be at this stage of my journey.","Frye Notch Lean-to

As I now think about it, I have recently described my days on the trail as ""tough"", ""strenuous"", ""difficult"", or ""hard"". Given the connotations of these descriptors, one could conclude that I'm not enjoying myself. Nothing could be further from the truth. As my daily mileage has decreased due to the more difficult Maine terrain, I have been enjoying it more. Yes, I'm certainly working harder, but I'm deriving more satisfaction from the effort, and developing a pride I had not felt before. It follows, therefore, that today must have been my most satisfying day, since the effort I put forth was very significant!I started the morning off with Mahoosuc Notch, the ""hardest one mile of the AT."" Only, I didn't find it hard; I found it to be a total blast! Navigating my way through a boulder field settled into the bottom of a notch between two mountains (photo), I had to choose my best route, twist and turn and tuck my body to move through tight fits, creatively use all four limbs to secure safe holds, sometimes take a ""leap of faith"" to an awaiting boulder, and use my balance and strength to negotiate my next move when there didn't appear to be a safe way forward. It was a brain teaser, Twister, and a session at the gym, all at once. As I then moved on to Fulling Mill Mountain, Goose Eye Mountain, and Mts. Carlo and Success, all part of the Mahoosuc Range, the steepness of the climbs (and descents) had me repeating some of the moves I carried out in Mahoosuc Notch. The heartier the physical demands, it seems, the more I respond, and the more I enjoy. On the way to Gentian Pond Shelter today, I crossed over from Maine into New Hampshire, and passed the 1,300 mile mark. Before the White Mountains come to dominate my journal over the next two weeks, I want to give Maine its due. From Mt. Katahdin to the Mahoosucs, from the 100 Mile Wilderness through the Bigelows, Saddlebacks and the Baldpates, from Millinocket to Monson, Caratunk, Stratton and Rangelely, from the high peaks to the bogs, I have loved walking through this state. I met the loveliest hostel owners and restaurateurs, and shared the trail with a great bunch of SoBos and flip-floppers. I was rained on a total of six hours over 23 days, and the dry weather brought forth bugs for just three days.

Hiking 11.8 miles, I walked steadily down into Gorham, NH, where the elevation is only 780 feet above sea level, and arrived at 1:30 pm. While there were a couple of climbs involved, nothing was comparable to the stretch of ascents and descents I had seen over the last 100 miles of Maine. After a somewhat cloudy Sunday, today was filled with blue sky and I was privy to some captivating views of both the Presidential Range and the Franconia Ridge, two mainstays of the White Mountain National Forest. In particular, Mts. Washington and Madison (photo, left to right), distinguished themselves. The anticipation of being above tree line for a singular, 13-mile stretch of the Presidential Range is hard to beat.

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545277,"After a very tough sixty mile stretch of the trail, I was supposed to zero today. That didn't quite happen....I arrived at the White Mountains Lodge and Hostel, and, quite happily, found Cinderella and Waterboy already checked in. I had met them early on in their SoBo trek, but hadn't seen them in some time. The White Mountains are a particularly intimidating section of the trail for thru-hikers. Part of that is due to the excitement and anxiety generated by the elevations involved and the long, unprotected stretches above tree line. But another part is due to the ""logistics"" of hiking through them: How many miles per day should one count on? Where best to stay? How much food to carry? What are the best options should the weather close in?When I arrived at the hostel, I asked for input on my plan from Marnie, Melissa and Mellow, the staff there. To a person, they recommended that I hike the very first section of the Whites, between Gorham and Pinkham Notch, twenty-one miles in all, in one day! That being far beyond my mileage expectations for this part of the AT, it took me a while to wrap my head around it. But when I better understood their reasoning, and heard that Cinderella and Waterboy had already signed on, I jumped aboard, and pushed off my zero until the next day. Hiking the 21 miles in one day would be a significant challenge. Between Gorham and Pinkham Notch stood the Carter-Moriah Range and the Wildcats, with elevations topping 4,800 feet. With the satisfaction I felt still fresh from tackling the mountains of Maine in rather good form, I was ready to take it on. Since we would be returning to the hostel after what would prove to be a long day of hiking, I did not need to carry my tent, sleeping bag, stove and other gear required for overnight tenting. Instead, I would carry only a day pack, with food, water, layers, rain gear, head lamp and emergency gear. With a pack weighing about 12 pounds, half of what I would normally carry, I set out with Cinderella and Waterboy. We'd be hiking from Pinkham Notch back to the hostel in Gorham to simplify the logistics. This way, the steep climb up the Wildcats would come early. The weather, especially for the White Mountains, was ideal. As we climbed up and up, the views we had of the Presidential Range on the other side of Pinkham Notch were spectacular, whetting our appetites for what was to come in the next few days. With Waterboy out front, putting on a spirited pace, we hiked up and out of Pinkham Notch, up and over the Wildcats, and then climbed through the Carters and Mt. Moriah. Our experiences in Maine had prepared us well for the drops in between the various peaks we climbed. Without the burden of full packs, we kept moving at the fast clip we knew we had to maintain to get the twenty-one miles done before daylight faded. Our last climb, up Mt. Moriah, was particularly wonderful, and not just because it was the day's final ascent. The trail up followed bedrock almost the whole way, and the late afternoon views in all directions, softened by the sinking sun, were breathtaking. It was a joy to be in alpine surroundings late on a summer day in great weather. The hike down off of Mt. Moriah back to Gorham was long and very wearying on legs already tested by such an extended day. By the time we pulled into the hostel at 7:30 pm, we had been on the trail for 11.5 hours. I was thrilled with how well I had responded to the challenge. With Cinderella and Waterboy leading the way and providing welcome camaraderie, what could have been a tedious march was instead a real joy. What a wonderful way to start my trek through the White Mountains. Tomorrow's zero will be welcome and well-deserved.","Gorham, NH

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545278,"Gorging myself on a big, delicious breakfast from Melissa of the White Mountains Lodge and Hostel, I began my latest zero in style. Today would be a day of rest -- much needed -- after my trek through Maine and the first part of the White Mountains. The White Mountains can be divided into five ""sections"", using the low points, or notches, to delineate those sections. Since I am now hiking south, the Whites, for me, run northeast to southwest, as they cross the state of New Hampshire. I hiked the first section, between Gorham and Pinkham Notch, yesterday. Next, from Pinkham Notch to Crawford Notch, is the Presidential Range, with the AT crossing Mt. Madison and Mt. Washington, which, at 6,289 feet, is the highest peak in the Northeast. After the Presidentials, and between Crawford Notch and Franconia Notch, comes the third section, featuring Mts. Guyot, Garfield, Lafayette and Lincoln, and South Twin Mountain. The fourth section, running from Franconia Notch to Kinsman Notch, has Mt. Kinsman front and center. Finally, west of Kinsman Notch, stands Mt. Moosilauke, the last mountain above tree line that I will encounter on my trek. As I move through the Whites, I will encounter unmatched vistas, stay three nights at full-service huts managed by the Appalachian Mountain Club, remain above tree line for thirteen continuous miles in the Presidentials, and likely meet a bit of unwelcoming weather so common in this particular alpine environment. I plan to take seven more days, for a total of eight, to hike the AT's one hundred miles in the Whites. Along with my journey through Maine, this will be the highlight of my Appalachian Trail trek. Tomorrow, starting the second section, I climb up from Pinkham Notch to summit Mt. Madison, at 5,366 feet above sea level. I will spend the night at the Madison Spring Hut, just off the summit.Today's photo of the Presidential Range was shot on yesterday's hike. From left to right: Mts. Washington, Jefferson, Adams and Madison.","Gorham, NH
","Gorham, NH","Aug 10, Wed",0
Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545456,"Starting out at the Pinkham Notch Visitors Center, I found the proper trail and began the 3,300 foot climb up to the summit of Mt. Madison. At 5,366 feet, Madison is the fifth-highest of the Presidential peaks. When these most prominent peaks in the White Mountains were named in 1820's, the first five presidents were honored by attaching their names, in the order served, to the five highest peaks. Thus, Washington, our first president, had his name given to the highest peak, John Adams, our second president, his name to the second highest, and Thomas Jefferson, his to the third. James Madison and James Monroe, as fourth and fifth presidents, were similarly honored, only to later find that Mt. Monroe was actually twenty-two feet higher than Mt. Madison, thus relegating the fourth president's namesake peak to fifth highest.Not that it mattered to me. Mt. Madison is the first Presidential peak crossed on the AT when heading south, and so up I went. The trail began rather benignly, gaining just 500 feet in its first five miles. At that point, though, it turned sharply up, and in the next 2.5 miles, rose 2,800 feet more. Still, I did not think that the grade matched the steepness I found in Maine, and I was a bit surprised when I found I had climbed above tree line faster than expected. With Mts. Washington, Jefferson, Adams and Madison spreading out before me as I emerged from the forest, I began to appreciate just how different this alpine environment was. The shear expanse of the treeless region across the four peaks was breathtaking. It quickly became clear to me that, if the weather turned sour when one was up above 5,000 feet, there were few places to find sanctuary. In addition, the peaks were home to boulder after boulder, most quite roughly surfaced, so that one's feet took a real beating as they followed the cairns that marked the rocky trail. These boulders had a different feel than ones found elsewhere on the AT, and that strange feel added to the otherworldliness of the Presidential peaks. Finally, a decent, but by no means strong, breeze was blowing that pushed me just enough to have me sometimes unsteady on my feet. On this day, I was sensing all this under a sun-filled blue sky. But given my experience with storms in Virginia, I couldn't help but think how dangerous it would all become if the weather, infamously changeable here on a moment's notice, turned bad. I couldn't shake this sense as I went up the rocky ridge leading to Madison's summit, and then over the top. In fact, I found myself strangely unsettled by it all, and, at 1:30 pm, was glad to arrive at the Madison Spring Hut where I had a reservation to spend the night. The AMC hut system, not to be confused with shelters, lean-to's and huts found on other sections of the AT, comprises eight generously-sized ""huts"", each housing bunk rooms, a dining room, bathrooms and a commercial-sized kitchen that issues forth breakfast and dinner to its patrons. The eight huts are spread somewhat evenly across the expanse of the White Mountains, with all but one easily accessible from the AT. In addition to tonight's stay at Madison Spring Hut, I plan to stay tomorrow night at the Lake of the Clouds Hut, down off of Mt. Washington's summit, and at Galehead Hut, sited just before the beginning of the Franconia Ridge. With my reaction thus far to the Presidential Range, I'm gladto be spending my two nights here, amidst its peaks, in the huts, and not in my tent at one of the various campsites. Dinner now complete and my bunk ready for a long night's sleep, I am hopeful that tomorrow's weather may conform to forecast. With a chance of rain, perhaps in the afternoon, I should have time to complete the AT's 5.7 mile march to the summit of Mt. Washington, and then descend its 1.5 miles to Lake of the Clouds Hut.","Pinkham Notch
",Madison Spring Hut,"Aug 11, Thu",7.80
Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545489,"When I left Madison Spring Hut at 7:30 am, I was greeted by a mix of blue sky, clouds and sun. I was hoping my string of great weather would hold out for one more day to allow me to get to the top of Mt. Washington and then down to Lake of the Clouds Hut, 1,200 feet below the summit. Unfortunately, things didn't quite work out that way. From my starting elevation of 4,800 feet, I soon found myself climbing, as the AT headed for Mts. Adams and Jefferson, both over 5,700 feet. While the trail didn't take me over either summit, I was soon above 5,500 feet. As I rose in my first hour of hiking, any hint of blue sky or sun was erased and I soon found myself draped in thickening clouds, a heavy mist and rising winds. Visibility dropped to one cairn's distance, and I couldn't see much of anything. Just as I had done in Katahdin's heavy mist, I stowed my eyeglasses early on. This wasn't going as I had planned. Still, I pressed on towards Mt. Washington, hoping that at least the rain held off. I covered about four miles in three hours in the shrouded conditions. By then, I was more than halfway to Mt. Washington, and I grew cautiously optimistic. The rain started slowly, allowing me to put on my pack cover and my rain jacket. But it didn't take long before its intensity increased. Soon, I felt under attack, as the winds whipped the rain drops into armed projectiles. Was it rain or hail? Frankly, it didn't seem to make a difference as the effect was the same. The trail, or rather the string of boulders that passed as a trail, soon became slick, and the footing worsened. With the wind having its way with me, I was relying heavily on my trekking poles to keep upright. With conditions deteriorating, I approached a junction in the trail, about one mile from Washington's summit. There, I had the choice to continue on the AT and climb the last 800 feet of vertical to the mountain's top. If I proceeded, I would be met by 60 to 70 mph winds on the summit, with the realistic chance of more rain. At the junction, I could also choose to leave the AT, skirt the summit and, instead of climbing higher, take a more direct path to the safety of the Lake of the Clouds Hut, lying well below the peak. By the time I reached the junction, it had stopped raining, making the decision a bit less clear-cut. But, despite my rain jacket, I was fairly drenched, the footing was far from good, and the winds were strong, and would certainly be stronger at the summit. Not having to think too long, I headed for the hut. My new trail cut across the steep slope that held Mt. Washington's summit. Fully built from boulders, the trail had been flattened over the years and it appeared almost like a three-foot ledge across the slope. With the wind whipping and footing slippery, I hiked towards the hut. At some point, my right foot slipped. As I lost my balance, my body twisted to the left to compensate, and I momentarily faced uphill. I started to fall backwards and felt my rear end hit the edge of ledge. At this point, still facing uphill but in a seated position, my twenty-six pound pack was not my friend. My momentum was carrying me backwards, down the slope, and my pack was hastening my descent. This was not good. With all my might, and my hands still in my pole straps, I grabbed at the ledge's boulders, hoping to stop the inevitable. But it was too little, too late. I felt myself ""turtling"", my pack carrying me down, backwards, over the ledge. No, this was definitely not good. Out of time, I didn't see how this was going to end well. Then, suddenly, I stopped from falling further, lying flat on my back. What had been hastening my fall had become my saving grace. My pack, rather full from my recent resupply in Gorham, protruded quite far off my back. As I fell backward down the slope, it found a boulder sitting below the ledge and, in a turn of immense good fortune, supported me in a supine position. I still had to get myself back up fully on the ledge, which was not easy, given the anchor-like pack on my back, but soon I was on all fours, stunned, but safe. I gathered myself, saw that I had sliced my hand in my attempt to arrest my descent, and moved on towards the hut. I still had a mile to walk and, not surprisingly, proceeded slowly. When I arrived at the hut at 12:00 pm, I was relieved, but would rather have been fully off the mountain. By morning, I imagine my outlook may improve, but, for now, I'd be happier below 4,000 feet. Will I try to summit Mt. Washington in the morning, if the weather improves? Time will tell. Right now, at 8:00 pm, it's clear and calm. Things change quickly here.","Madison Spring Hut

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545673,"I awoke long before sunrise, and lay in my bunk at Lakes of the Clouds Hut, wondering what the weather would be at 6:00 am. I went back and forth in my mind. Should I try to summit first, or just start down, beginning my fourteen miles to Ethan Pond Shelter?At 6:00 am, I pulled on my still-wet hiking clothes and stepped outside. Visibility was poor, but the winds were greatly diminished and it was not raining. In addition, it was relatively warm again, high 50s and maybe 60, as it had been throughout my days in the Presidentials. I approached one of the hut crew, and asked for any insights. To her, it was all about the wind, and it appeared to be a decent morning in that regard. Deciding to go for it, I left the hut, 1,200 feet below the summit, at 6:45 am. As I climbed, it was soon spitting rain, but nothing like yesterday. The winds were indeed calm, blowing just 20 to 30 mph. I hiked the trail's 1.4 miles quickly and was on top of Mt. Washington in 45 minutes. I fist-bumped the summit marker and immediately headed down, arriving back at Lakes of the Clouds at 8:15. The hut crew had kept my breakfast for me, and I ate a celebratory meal. Visibility during my early morning hike was slightly better than yesterday, but it was still pea soup. It would stay that way and I didn't bother pulling out my phone for any pictures all day. Today's photo is from yesterday, before I was completely engulfed in the clouds. From the summit of Mt. Washington at 6,288 feet, I would climb down 5,000 feet to Crawford Notch as the day progressed. With rain continuing on and off all day, it was challenging at times, especially descending Webster Cliffs, where the grade was steep and slabs of wet rock were frequent. By 3:30, I had made it to Crawford Notch and officially passed out of the Presidential Range. After a bit of a climb up the other side, I arrived at Ethan Pond Shelter at 5:00. Choosing to spend the night in the shelter with the evening's impending rain, I was soon fast asleep in my sleeping bag, proud to have intelligently summited Mt. Washington in trying conditions. As I left Lakes of the Clouds this morning, I learned that when I made the decision yesterday to divert directly to the hut rather than to try to make it to the top, the Mt. Washington Observatory was soon to record wind speeds of 87 mph at the summit. I also learned that I had indeed hiked through a hailstorm. During my three days in the Presidentials, I was certainly given the ""full"" experience. I'm glad to be moving on.","Lake of the Clouds Hut
",Ethan Pond Shelter,"Aug 13, Sat",13.90
Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545818,"Last night's rain pounded the shelter's metal roof, and sleep was a bit hard to come by. I was already tuckered out from my adventures in the Presidentials, and thus hoped that today's hike would be easier --physically, mentally and emotionally. Happily, I got my wish. The miles passed without incident and, after summiting the 4,902-foot South Twin Mountain, I arrived at Galehead Hut at 2:30 pm, giving me some time to dry things out when the sky brightened a bit. Only my shoes remained wet, and they were probably the one item I most desperately wanted dry. I have stayed at Galehead Hut twice before: first in 1973 with my brother, Andrew, when we went on an Appalachian Mountain Club backpacking trip together (photo of the 1973 Hut Register), and once about ten years ago when Sandy and I spent three days hiking in the Whites. It's very familiar territory. Still, I have not hiked the AT west of Galehead before, and that's exactly where I am headed tomorrow. I'll be hiking along the Franconia Ridge and summiting Mts. Lafayette and Lincoln, the last two 5,000 foot peaks of my AT trek. When I descend off of Franconia Ridge tomorrow afternoon, I will have finished the third section of the Whites, that between Crawford and Franconia Notches, and have just two more days of hiking before I complete the White Mountains altogether!I ran into Cinderella and Waterboy today to discover that we will be staying at the same hostel on Monday night in North Woodstock, NH. We also commiserated with each other about our mutual friend, AJ, who, we just found out, had to leave the trail to tend to an injury. I wish my friend a speedy recovery.","Ethan Pond Shelter
",Galehead Hut,"Aug 14, Sun",11.80
Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545923,"Leaving Galehead Hut, I was bound for Franconia Ridge, one of the highlights of the White Mountains. Fully above tree line for two miles, it allows for stunning views in all directions before sending its hikers down sharply to Franconia Notch. Hiking under threatening skies, I first had to summit Mts. Garfield, Lafayette and Lincoln. The first proved to be a bit more difficult to climb despite being more than 500 feet shorter than the other two. I then emerged above tree line and tackled Lafayette, at 5,263 feet. Someday, I would love to come back and climb this one again, given my sense that it is indeed spectacular. Unfortunately, visibility was again extremely poor and and I wasn't able to fully appreciate the fruits of my strenuous hike up. Instead, I was treated to strong winds and blowing mist that made the summit uncomfortably cool. By the time I got to Mt. Lincoln, another 5,000 footer, little spots of blue sky showed themselves from time to time, but I was again in the clouds for most the time. Finally, as I climbed down from Lincoln onto Franconia Ridge, I dropped enough elevation that some views appeared of the ridge itself. Looking back up to the two 5,000 foot peaks, however, yielded nothing but cloud-shrouded summits. From Mt. Madison to Mt. Lincoln, over the course of four days, I hiked a distance of forty miles, all in the clouds. Not a view to be had from any summit. It was often blowing hard, often cool, often mist-filled, and sometimes raining. It's been one of those weather patterns that won't give way, and, when combined with the peculiar micro-climates of the high peaks region, it's resulted in tough hiking conditions. Thankfully, I've stayed in a hut, hostel or shelter each night since arriving in the White Mountains, so at least I've been dry at night. Still, it's been an exciting stretch, and I feel that I have experienced a side of the Whites that probably shows itself more often than not. I still have two more days of hiking in the Whites, and perhaps the weather will turn for me.","Galehead Hut

Leaving from Kinsman Notch and hiking north to Franconia Notch so that we could finish up back at the Notch Hostel, we covered the sixteen miles somewhat quickly. The climbs up South and North Kinsman, both over 4,200 feet, were steep in places, and we were able to get most of the ascents in before the rain started falling. For the bulk of the afternoon, we hiked in showers, but thankfully arrived back at the hostel before the really heavy stuff hit. On our afternoon descent, we stopped at the most western of the AMC huts, Lonesome Lake Hut, and were immediately taken with its layout, lake setting and the spectacular view it offered of Franconia Ridge and Mts. Lafayette and Lincoln. To a person, we agreed that this hut was worth a return visit, and would be a great base from which to hike Franconia Ridge. Tomorrow, I take my well-earned zero. Since my last one in Gorham, I've hiked seventy miles through the heart of the White Mountains, and my legs are feeling the effects. I've a number of trail chores to do, phone calls to make, and relaxing to squeeze in, and the morning's forecasted rain won't bother me a bit. On Thursday, I complete my run through the White Mountains with a rather tough climb up Mt. Moosilauke. Somewhat hard to believe, but at 4,802 feet, it will be the last 4,000-footer of my Appalachian trek.

Fortunately, it didn't last long and was over as soon as I made it back down into the trees. Once I finished my descent of the 4,802 foot mountain and had left the White Mountains National Forest, I found myself in a world that I had forgotten existed. The steep slopes, very rocky and wet trails and omnipresent roots of the White Mountains were replaced by the rolling terrain and pine needled trail beds of the Connecticut River valley. While I still have a couple of last climbs tomorrow before I fully hit the river's plain, the change from the past eight days of mountainous ascents and descents couldn't have been more stark.

I was bound for Mink Brook and would have to climb two small mountains to get there. They would be my last climbs before passing into Vermont. First, though, I would have to descend from the top of Smarts Mountain, where I camped last night, and that would test my shaky knees. The trip down was uneventful, and my knees came out of it in fine shape, a little sore, but no cause for concern. On the subsequent climb up Holt's Ledge, the site of the Dartmouth Skiway, my energy level seemed to recover as well. As I descended Holt's Ledge, my knees began to ache a bit more, but, again, didn't give me much pause. I ended my day with a 1,200 foot ascent of Moose Mountain and, while a bit tired at that point, I was reasonably confident that I was on the rebound from yesterday. I have a very easy eight-mile day tomorrow to arrive in Hanover, NH, by noon, and that should further help my recovery. On the way to Hanover, the home of Dartmouth College, I am meeting my fraternity brother, Alpo, who wanted to hike in with me. (Alpo, a Dartmouth nickname, will suit him just fine as a trail name, too, if he's interested.) The eight miles will be more enjoyable with him along, and we'll grab lunch after. Alpo, a Providence native, was very helpful to Alison and me as we got settled there ten years ago. I hold both undergraduate and graduate degrees from Dartmouth, earned eight years apart. I disappointed myself as an undergraduate, and, after all these years, the regret is still fresh. My return to Hanover, and, ultimately, Harper's Ferry, as an Appalachian Trail thru-hiker, goes a long way to reset, in my mind, my story. The power of this journey I do not underestimate.

After breakfast at Lou's and my stop at the post office, it was just after 9:30 am when I hit the trail. Only ""trail"" is a bit of a misnomer in this case, as the AT travels along roads for more than three miles as it moves through Hanover, down the hill and over the bridge that spans the Connecticut River, and then into the lovely town of Norwich, VT. As a line of thunderstorms passed through last night, cooler weather moved in, and, when I started out, I could tell I was in for some delightful hiking. Under a day where sun and clouds shared the blue sky, temperatures remained in the sixties and one could feel Autumn in the air. A big, blustery, breeze rustled the maple leaves all afternoon, yielding the kind of day that my daughter, Holly, and I, just love. As the AT left the Connecticut River behind, it steadily climbed all day, preparing to meet the Green Mountains as they rise from central Vermont. With stands of sugar maples and pine trees sharing the forest, the trail was soft underfoot, without rocks and roots to disturb a hiker's rhythm. It was an utterly delicious day to hike, and the 14.7 miles between Hanover and Thistle Hill Shelter went by as if in a dream. In the morning, I crossed the bridge over the Connecticut and moved into Norwich. Heading down Main Street to the center of town, I stepped into a crosswalk to turn onto Elm Street. When I reached the far side, a voice called out, ""Blue!"", and I focused my attention on a minivan idling at the stop sign. Inside, the woman behind the wheel excitedly told me through the passenger side window that she had been following me on Trail Journals, and deduced from yesterday's entry that, after my stops at Lou's and the post office, I ought to be happening along Main Street just about this time, and she hoped to see me. I couldn't have been more surprised, or pleased. She told me that a friend of hers was on the trail this year, that she got hooked reading a number of other hiker journals, and mine was one. We held up traffic a bit, neither wanting the conversation to end. Hat Lady couldn't have been more kind or more excited. Here was a woman I had never met, captivated by my account of the trail, and waiting and hoping to see me where she knew I should be. I thanked her for making my day, and she said I had made hers.

The AT does not summit Killington, Vermont's second highest mountain at 4,241 feet, leaving instead that chore to a side trail that many thru-hikers choose to climb. Through the summer, the gondola that services Killington Peak is in operation, as is the restaurant at the summit lodge. For me, then, the draw of ice cream was too strong, and I decided to hike to the top. Munching on an ice cream bar at 10:00 am, I found myself on yet another summit without a view. Clouds were obscuring the valley and surrounding mountains, just as I had found time and time again in the White Mountains. I was beginning to feel like Pig Pen, but with clouds around my head instead of his ubiquitous dirt. Getting off of Killington was going to test my knees. Heading south from the summit, the trail offers a long, slow descent, dropping 2,700 feet over five miles. This is exactly the kind of descent that one with aching knees would love to avoid. Much better to have a short, steep, decline than a drawn-out one. But, without a choice, I was really hoping that the anti-inflammatory pills I had been taking for three days were up to the task of relieving any pain. I started out quite tentatively, taking it slow and steady. As I made it through the first few miles of descent, I was pleasantly surprised at how little my knees hurt. Yes, they ached a bit, but nothing like the pain that had been with me before I started in on the pills. By the end of the five miles, I declared the pills a complete success, and my attitude about the remainder of my trek improved greatly. Once I finished my 15.8 miles for the day, I hitched into Rutland, getting a ride right away. I arrived at our hotel, put my laundry in, showered, shaved and waited for Alison to arrive. It had been three weeks since I had last seen her, and I was anxious to reconnect. I didn't have to wait too long before her knock on the door announced her arrival. We found a great restaurant in Rutland's historic district to kick off our time together, and caught up over dinner. With my zero, we have all tomorrow together, but I imagine the time will go too quickly. While in Rutland, we will have lunch with Cinderella and Waterboy, who will also be in town. Alison has yet to meet them, and I imagine we'll have a few laughs together.","Churchill Scott Shelter

When I first raised the topic of perhaps hiking the AT in 2016, Alison didn't hesitate in her support. From the beginning, she has been 100% behind me and my expedition. I don't think, though, that either of us fully understood what it would mean to have me away for half of a year. Over these past four months, we have learned just how big an undertaking this truly is, and how it simply wouldn't have been possible without a Herculean effort by Alison. I can't thank her enough. I will never know all that she has done to support and keep me on the trail, while holding down the fort. Answering my various hiking needs, assuming my responsibilities at home, having two college-aged girls coming and going, and busily following through on her own endeavors, Alison has somehow found a way to do the work of two and remain in good cheer. If I succeed in completing all 2,189 miles of the AT, it will be because I had the ability to focus all of my energies on the task at hand. The work and sacrifices required from Alison to allow me that focus have been wholly unfair. In essence, she has permitted me to be totally selfish for six months. I cannot dream of a better partner, in life or on the trail. I am so fortunate to call her my wife, my best friend and the love of my life.","VT Route 103

The day's hiking, pursued under a brilliant blue sky, proved to contain some ups, some downs, some rocks and some roots, all in moderation. With my knees again aided by a dose of anti-inflammatories, I was quite comfortable and completed 17.6 miles on the day. Coming out of New Hampshire's White Mountains, I wasn't sure how quickly Vermont would allow me to begin putting in bigger mileage days. Now, after five days of hiking in the Green Mountain State, I think I have my answer. For my remaining four days here, I am confident that I can put in 17 to 18 mile days without much trouble. That bodes well for me in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey and the easier terrain I will find there. NoBos have been telling me that I'll be cruising through southern New England, and I'm now becoming a believer.","VT Route 103

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547157,"Waking to more beautiful weather, I hoped that this would be my day to finally enjoy a summit view. I would be climbing four peaks between 2,600 and 3,500 feet, not tall by AT standards, but certainly high enough to see the surrounding countryside. I didn't have to wait long. Summiting Baker Peak before 9:00 am, I had clear views in two directions. Then, on Bromley Mountain around lunchtime, I found myself with a 360 degree view of Vermont. With the day a bit hot and humid, I decided to take a break and ride the Bromley summit chairlift down to the base lodge and grab a hamburger. Overpriced and not terribly good, the burger still hit the spot. I rode back up to the summit and resumed my hike. I put in 17.6 miles for the second day in a row, confirming my view that 17 to 18 mile days in the mountains of Vermont were quite acheivable. Given the thunderstorms forecast to arrive later tonight, I've decided to stay in the Spruce Peak Shelter. Still preferring to be in my tent, I wouldn't mind some rain to justify my decision. I continue to run across more of the NoBos that I had met in the south, this time, Padfoot, Hoot, Rambler and Pyro. With time running short to get all the way to Katahdin, I wouldn't expect to see many more.","Lost Pond Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547303,"Among AT thru-hikers, Vermont is known for its manufacturing of....mud. Deep, dark, sticky, shoe-gobbling mud. Big swaths of it. During my first six days in Vermont, I had seen indications of this legendary mud, but hadn't yet gotten the full treatment. Until today. The thunderstorms that were forecasted for last night didn't bring rain in earnest to Spruce Peak Shelter, where I was staying. We did have a few passing showers, but, by morning, there was hardly any evidence. However, as I started hiking, I saw clear indications that other parts of the trail had seen a fair amount of rain. Under the morning's blue skies, I climbed up Stratton Mountain, enjoying the cooler, drier and breezier conditions brought in by last night's front. With a generous helping of switchbacks, the trail's grades were quite manageable, and my ascent of the 3,936 foot peak was fairly carefree. On top, I climbed the fire tower and was treated to tremendous views in all directions. While on the summit, I decided to eat lunch earlier than usual, and took out my tortillas and peanut butter. Noticing my gourmet meal, a young couple on a day hike asked if I'd like some raspberry preserves. With my mouth watering, I instantly accepted. After one hundred days of PB on tortillas, I luxuriated in the addition of the preserves. Nothing ever tasted better. After lunch, I headed down, destined for Story Spring Shelter. As the trail finished its descent from Stratton and flattened out, the mud stepped up its game and became more prevalent. Bobbing and weaving to avoid being sucked under, I assumed, of course, that the mud would dissipate once the trail started to climb again. Boy, was that a wrong assumption. As the trail turned up to gain elevation, the mud responded by covering larger and larger areas. Stepping on half-submerged sticks, rocks, logs and roots, I mostly stayed above the worst of it, but it took a concerted effort. Only after I climbed close to one thousand feet did the mud seem to lessen. By the end of the day, I had had my fill. Keep in mind that this summer in New England has been hot and dry. I can only imagine how much muddier it would be in a ""normal"" year. At the summit of Stratton, a plaque recognizes the mountain's role in the creation of the Appalachian Trail. Benton MacKaye, educated as a forester, imagined from its summit the possibility of a hiking trail running through the ridges and ranges of the Appalachian Mountains, from Maine to Georgia. In 1921, he published an article, An Appalachian Trail: A Project in Regional Planning, putting forth the idea that such a trail would allow city dwellers up and down the east coast easy access to the considerable benefits of the wilderness. Enthusiastically received, work soon began, and, in 1937, after more than a decade of effort, the Appalachian Trail was born.","Spruce Peak Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547377,"My eighth day in Vermont was fairly uneventful, save for a number of encounters with NoBos I originally met down south. Two, in particular, of these chance meetings delighted me, as I so wished that the people involved were still on the trail, and I was losing hope. First, a young couple from Florida, Sunny and Boom Box, appeared at my campsite last night. We caught up for just a minute, and they both appeared happy and geared up for the Whites and Maine. I had seen them a few times at various places in the south, and always thought that they were just the nicest people. Then, today, I ran into Sprinter and Zing on the trail. They were part of that great group of hikers that I got to know in the Shenandoahs, sharing shelters while the Virginia rains persisted. We chatted for a good twenty minutes, sharing experiences and recommendations, and I was glad to see that they both were well. Another young couple, they seemed well-suited for each other, and for the trail. In addition to those two couples, I ran across Mama Bear and the crew of guys from Boston with whom she was hiking, and Slim, and heard that Twinkletoes was in Rutland when Alison and I were there. There are only a handful of people left that I haven't seen yet, Mother Theresa and Roulette chief among them. I guess there's a chance our paths will cross, but not a good one. With another perfect day for hiking, I climbed the 3,748 foot Glastenbury Mountain, and then scooted up the fire tower on its summit, which offered pretty much the same view as Stratton's fire tower did yesterday. Tonight, I'm in the charming town of Bennington, VT, picking up a few supplies for the next two days of hiking. Tomorrow, I will cross over into Massachusetts, leaving behind the northern New England states of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont.

It was simply a cloudy day, rain never threatening, and I enjoyed hiking with the moderate temperature. Today was my last day in Vermont, as I crossed its shared border with Massachusetts mid-afternoon. In total, I spent ten days in Vermont, hiking for nine, and it only rained on my zero day, and for a bit one night. Now, that's good planning!Despite my earlier pronouncements to the contrary, I did run across three more NoBos today, Swiss Miss, Iron Butterfly and Frisky. To me, it's feeling awfully late for them, and I hope they are successful in completing their hikes. I arrived in Williamstown, MA, after a long 18.4 mile day and had to walk the two miles into town from the trailhead when my hitchhike attempt failed to attract a taker. The five days since Rutland had me quite tired, and the extra two miles into town seemed like ten. Tomorrow, I climb Mt. Greylock, the highest mountain in Massachusetts. Alison is coming up to see me again, and she'll pick me up after the hike and bring me back to Williamstown for a much-needed zero on Friday.

After eighteen months of planning and preparation, and over four months of hiking, that's a bit hard to comprehend. I expect that I will cycle through some very mixed emotions over the next six weeks.Today, I tackled the ascent of Mt. Greylock, at 3,491 feet, the highest mountain in Massachusetts. Coming out of Williamstown, the climb is fairly steep and certainly commands one's attention. Under a second straight morning of cloudy skies, I trudged upward, tired from my march through Vermont. When I reached the top, I realized that it would be the last time I would stand above 3,000 feet on my journey. From here on out, through Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and into West Virginia, the terrain beneath the AT flattens out, and I never hike another mountain of any significant height.

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547593,"Back in late June, when I was still in Virginia, a good friend asked me, ""What has been the biggest surprise of your venture on the AT?"" Since then, I've been noodling on that question and, with 1,600 miles now behind me, I have four thoughts. First, being ""hangry"" (a contraction of hungry and angry), is a common occurrence among thru-hikers. When you're burning upwards of 5,000 calories a day, becoming irritable from a lack of food, or being just plain hungry all the time, is a fact of life on the trail. The surprise is that I've never suffered from being ""hangry."" I seemingly planned my food strategy well and have the benefit of Alison sending me resupply boxes. Second, in preparing for the AT, prospective thru-hikers are cautioned that they will have to deal with ""bad"" days, when the temptation to quit is strong. In fact, Badger, the publisher of the website, Appalachian Trials, counsels that hikers should write down, before they start, why they are hiking the trail, and the consequences of both succeeding and failing in their quest. That way, they have a reminder of what brought them to the trail, and, on those bad days, referring to it might keep them from quitting. The surprise for me is that I haven't had a bad day, I haven't faced an existential trail crisis, and the thought of quitting has literally never crossed my mind. Every morning, I've woken up, excited to hike. Third, I'm surprised at, well, the lack of surprises. I'm not sure it's a good thing, but very little of day-to-day trail existence has surprised me, suggesting that I was really well prepared, in all aspects, for my journey. Finally, with ""progress"" spinning this globe ever-faster, I'm very pleasantly surprised that the AT even exists. A simple concept, this Appalachian footpath, and, unfortunately, an anachronism in today's world. Imagine trying to create this 2,200 mile trail today. The roadblocks to its birth almost 100 years ago were probably no less significant. Yet, people rallied around the simple concept and found a way. And, today, people of like minds keep finding ways to protect the trail, to maintain it, to improve it and to educate hikers on its use. It's really an amazing thing, this simple concept, a throwback and teacher of so many things that we're in the process of losing. That the AT exists, vibrant and strong, is a surprise in and of itself.","MA Route 8 (Cheshire)

Joe and I would hike together for 8.3 miles, grab lunch in Dalton, and then I would continue on by myself another four miles before calling it a day at the Kay Wood Shelter. The weather was again perfect and the trail, after climbing one thousand feet in the first hour, planed off and then gently headed downward into Dalton. Joe and I, having eaten dinner the night before with our wives, continued to catch up while we hiked. We worked together for seven years at Corning, and remained friends after we each left the company. Alison and I count Joe and Keri among the nicest people we know, and we enjoy their company immensely. With my relatively short day today, I pulled into the shelter at 3:30. As the afternoon and early evening wore on, SoBos started pouring in, and there must be at least ten now in camp. Water is getting harder and harder to find, as the dry weather persists, but this shelter has a decent spring. I'm pretty sure that I will have to start carrying more with me, since many streams are no longer reliable water sources, and I don't want to be caught short.

Under another gorgeous day, I finished 17.6 miles to end at Upper Goose Pond Cabin. With a sandy beach, a nice porch with chairs, and a caretaker who makes pancakes in the morning, a stay here is almost mandatory. After pitching my tent quite a ways from the cabin to ensure that I would sleep well, I took a lovely swim in the pond to clean up and relax, and then joined Rolling on the porch and shot the breeze with Kevin and Tackle, the caretakers. Kevin made a few trays of nachos and also plied us with popcorn. I can't wait for his pancakes tomorrow morning, which he said he'd be happy to serve at 6:30 am to allow me to get on the trail by 7:00. Now, that's customer service!I found flowing water at one stream today; all other water sources were either dry or stagnant pools. From what I understand, tomorrow will not be much better. However, some trail angels have begun to leave gallon bottles of water at roadsides and trailheads, which they refill from time to time.

Kevin and Tackle had been up for some time, manning the kitchen, for as I sat down, they brought out a plate of delicious pancakes. My first helping didn't last long and they were happy to oblige with a second. It was all as good as advertised. I had a long hike planned to reach Tom Leonard Shelter, and it helped tremendously that the day held the first hints of fall. Another beautiful blue sky day, it remained cool and breezy. The ferns had begun to lay down, with some of those still standing turning a nice yellow. Bushes had also begun to turn, with an odd tree following suit. During my 21.1 mile day, it was again difficult to find water. Leaving Upper Goose Pond Cabin fully loaded, I wasn't desperate enough to pull from stagnant pools when I started to run low. But as the day progressed, I began to get a bit worried. Then, while crossing a country lane, I happened across an adorable ""trail"" stand that offered water, soda, snacks and fresh eggs. Unmanned, it was run on the honor principle. I bought a soda and granola bar and filled up both water bottles. Later in the day, just as I was to begin the climb up to Tom Leonard Shelter, I came to a trailhead at a road crossing. There, trail angels has deposited at least a dozen gallon jugs of water for AT hikers. Having seen no water since the trail stand, and unsure whether there would be water at the shelter, I filled up. Without the thoughtfulness and generosity of these trail angels, I'm not sure what we hikers would do.

At this point in my trek, my gear, and I, have been visited time and again by those twin signs of overuse, Wear and Tear. My camp shirt is ripped, my hiking shorts torn, my watch is flapping around without one of its pins, and my gaiters are in need of some major TLC. As for me, my knees have been amply journalized, my legs are getting more tired with each passing week, and it now takes me a bit longer in the morning to unfurl myself from my tent. With all these signs of wear and tear, I've taken to carrying as little weight on my back as I can. I have sent home anything I don't absolutely need, and I now carry no more than four days of food at a time. Leaving Cheshire, MA, last Saturday, I had that four days of food, even though it would take me six days to reach Cornwall Bridge, CT, where Alison was again planning to meet me. As part of her visit, she would bring to me a food resupply box. So, leaving Cheshire, I needed to either make my four days of food last longer, or duck into a town along the way to resupply. I decided to try to stretch my four days of food to a fifth day and stop tomorrow (Wednesday) to resupply in Salisbury, CT, since it was an easy half mile from the trail. In hindsight, this wasn't a great plan, especially since I put in 21 miles yesterday, and planned another 19 today. As I started out from Tom Leonard Shelter today, I was feeling the twin effects of not enough food, and yesterday's 21 mile day. Fortunately, there was indeed water at the shelter, so at least I was well hydrated. The first nine miles of the day were fairly flat, at least by AT standards. The second half of the day would prove otherwise, as I had to climb Mt. Bushnell, Mt. Everett and Mt. Race. Now, no one would confuse these for White Mountains peaks, but each was rocky and relatively steep, and I had to ultimately climb 1,800 feet to reach the summit of Mt. Everett. Relying on trail angel water about midday, I reached that point where the trail was about to turn up. Coming to a road crossing, I found a gathering of thru-hikers, which could only mean one thing: trail magic. Before I had enough time to completely ferret out what was happening, I heard someone ask if anyone knew the hiker, ""Blue"". Now close enough to answer for myself, I replied, not knowing yet who had asked. It took me a second, but I then picked out two familiar faces from the gathering. Only these two faces weren't hikers, they were the trail angels, and, better yet, they were my friends, Deb and Steve, on whose advice and expertise Alison and I have relied for almost ten years. Completely surprising me, Deb and Steve drove down from Waltham, MA, to put on a trail magic spread the likes of which I had not seen before. I was quickly in tears, touched by their kindness and generosity. With Deb leading the way, the assembled gang of hikers was soon feasting on sandwiches, fruit, cookies, soda, chips and more. Deb and Steve had also brought out folding chairs, and we got to enjoy our food in uncharacteristic comfort. With my stomach running on relative empty, I had a luscious turkey sandwich, an apple, watermelon, chocolate chip cookies, Oreos, carrots and celery, and three small cans of Coke. After sitting for the better part of an hour, I said my good-byes and thanked Deb and Steve profusely. It was so nice of them to come out to share my journey with me, and, better yet, to come bearing food!With a full stomach and my energy levels bolstered by sugar and caffeine, Mts. Bushnell, Everett and Race were no match for me. Like Tigger of Pooh fame, I bounced up the trail, enjoying every minute of the climbs.

In New Hampshire, it rained quite a bit in the White Mountains, but was beautiful for my time in the rest of the state. Today, as I expected might happen, I wasn't exactly feeling my oats. I was tired from yesterday's sugar and caffeine-fueled climb of the southern Massachusetts mountains. Still, I summited Bear Mountain, Connecticut's highest peak, and managed to put in a total of 18.7 miles. Around noon, I ducked into Salisbury for lunch and to pick up a few resupply items. While I know that I smell badly after five days of hiking, I was surprised by the fact that not one person, aside from my lunch server, said hello to me or showed any interest in my hike. The towns of northwest Connecticut are not known to be particularly hiker-friendly, and I'll be interested to see what happens in Cornwall Bridge and Kent.

With nighttime bringing no respite from the heat and stickiness, I found my sleeping bag, even opened as a quilt, much too hot. But, because of the gnats, I needed to cover myself to keep from being bitten. I finally chose to put back on my wet and smelly hiking shirt to benefit from its long sleeves. It also didn't help that my shelter companions decided to have a little party that lasted until 10:30 pm. I've now witnessed enough pot smoking to last a lifetime, and, in my opinion, it's too bad that partying in general has seemingly become an integral part of the AT experience for many hikers. I got maybe three hours' sleep all night, and wasn't too pleased when the forecasted storms held off until morning. Clearly, I would have been happier in my tent. When I set out hiking, relieved to be away from Ten Mile River Shelter, the heat and humidity were still very much present. Within minutes, I was sweating. Would the promised front ever get here?By 8:00 am, I had my answer. The sky grew dark, the winds picked up, and the rain started to fall. Quickly intensifying, the storm turned the trail river-like with run-off, since the ground was rock-hard and not accepting any penetration. The rain only lasted thirty minutes, much too short to have any appreciable impact on the water situation. But, as the front moved through, the temperatures dropped,the breeze remained, and, after a bit, one could feel drier air taking hold. By 10:00 am, it felt very much like fall and utterly fabulous conditions for hiking prevailed. Despite my lack of sleep, the changing weather put a spring in my step.

Already, the beech trees have begun to let loose their leaves, making the forest floor look more like October than September. The dry weather has stressed the trees, and, if the beech trees are any indication, I sense an early Autumn. After 20.6 miles, I ended the day at Morgan Stewart Shelter, which also has a well and hand pump. I could really get used to this!","Ten Mile River Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548582,"Since the shelter I stayed in last night had a well and hand-pump, I began the morning with full water bottles. After four hours of hiking, I came upon another shelter, it also having a well/hand-pump set-up as its water source, and so I filled up. And, towards the end of the day, I passed Canopus Lake, and filled up for the evening in its outlet stream. I had planned my day of hiking around these particular water sources, and I'm glad I did. While I did see a stream or two during my hike that might have yielded some water, you clearly cannot plan on any water source that depends upon rainfall and run-off. I did not pass any Trail Angel water in jugs today, but hope that continues to be an option. Looking ahead, it appears that I've passed the last of the wells and hand-pumps, and I'll have to be very diligent in planning for water from here on out. Today offered up some more superb hiking weather: blue skies, drier air and temperatures in the high seventies. Last night, it dipped into the high forties, but I think the next week's worth of nights will be warmer. The trail today was a bit more rugged than the last few days, making it a little harder than its topographic profile would suggest. I stopped after 17.3 miles and pitched my tent alongside Canopus Creek. Tomorrow afternoon, I cross the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge to arrive at Fort Montgomery, NY. The AT passes through the Trailside Zoo at Bear Mountain, and, while there, dips to its lowest elevation of just 160 feet above sea level. I plan to spend tomorrow night in Fort Montgomery, taking the opportunity to do my laundry, recharge my electronics, and get some dinner. I also have a resupply box from Alison awaiting me there.","Morgan Stewart Shelter

To those keeping score, that's nine pounds of water. It ends up that Canopus Creek was indeed flowing, and I needn't have carried all that extra weight in water, but these are the sorts of precautions that one must take. Of the four liters I carried in, I used one for dinner last night and one for breakfast this morning, leaving two with which to start out this morning's hike. So far, so good. The day again dawned beautifully, cool and cloudless. With a hotel room waiting for me in Fort Montgomery, NY, I had incentive to push my pace. The terrain seemed to suit me, as I flew up and down the various hills, and then made even better time on the flat sections. Covering a total of 17.4 miles, I crossed the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge (photo) at 2:00 pm, found the post office to pick up my food resupply box, and checked into my hotel before 3:00 pm.

With one of my two bottles nearly empty, I filled up and then had plenty of water for the remainder of the day. Another day down without a water crisis. I'll be interested to see what the next two days hold for me.

First, my pack was at its heaviest, with a full food bag and two liters of water. Second, the forecast called for mid-eighties, and, at 7:30 am, it was already fairly warm. Third, there were a bunch of climbs in my immediate future, starting with Bear Mountain itself. My premonition indeed came to pass. While not struggling, I did have to work hard, both mentally and physically, to hike the 17.6 miles that I had planned. There were many ups and downs, and the trail condition was a mixed lot, from loose stones and rocks to extensive slabs of bedrock on certain summits. Still, I wouldn't say that any of it was particularly difficult, as I had been warned. I have one more full day left in New York, and for it, the AT Guide has highlighted its challenging terrain, so we'll see what tomorrow brings. At times throughout the day, I found myself out in the open, without cover. This section of New York has showcased large, widely-spaced oak trees and a healthy understory, particularly of mountain laurel, and the woods have not been very dense. Thus, the sun often had me in its sights, blasting away at will. Fortunately, a welcome afternoon breeze finally came up to help reduce the heat's impact. Recently, and with some ease, I've begun to compile a few lists: What I'll Remember Most, What I'll Miss, What I Must Continue, and What I Look Forward To. It's an early attempt at organizing various thoughts that are coming to me as my time on the trail begins to wind down. What final form it all takes is unknown at this point. One thing, though, is for certain: it's a process.","Fort Montgomery, NY

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548793,"OK. That was tough. I'm still not ready to call it ""Mini Maine"" though, as today's New York terrain had a feeling all its own. Regardless, I worked very hard, and under ideal conditions. Yesterday's heat was a thing of the past, as today's temperature barely made it out of the sixties. A deep blue sky held sway all day, and it felt very fall-like. Just a gorgeous day for a walk in the woods. Only, it seemed like I was walking from one long slab of summit bedrock to the next, jumping like a mountain goat. The elevations in this section of New York barely broke 1,200 feet, yet each ""summit"" was bare, somewhat like Maine, but ringed by trees so views were limited. This summit bedrock extended like long fingers and the trail designers figured out the perfect path to link a number of hilltops together so that it seemed you were hiking on slabs for the better part of the day. In between, I visited a lot of New York hollows, half expecting the Headless Horseman to jump out at me. Even though I have hiked the 100 Mile Wilderness, I must say that I felt more alone and isolated today than I ever did in Maine. If I broke an ankle, I swear they wouldn't find me back there in those hollers for days. The continual very steep ascents and descents had me working hard all day, although no climb was over 600 feet in vertical gain. Compared to Maine and New Hampshire, these were mere hills, and most took no more than 20 minutes to climb. Tonight, my tent is pitched just one mile from the New Jersey border, and, in the morning, I move into my trek's twelfth state (of fourteen). Just Pennsylvania and Maryland further await me. While Alison and I were in Cornwall Bridge, CT, visiting with our friend, Margie, the naturalist, I asked her about a particular animal sound that I had heard repeatedly on my journey. Not knowing how to direct her, she suggested we listen to a CD of night sounds. So, while we toured northwestern Connecticut, we were entertained and captivated by all sorts of calls and the lively gentleman who narrated. In the end, we discovered that I had been listening to the barred owl, and, as I write, another is now hooting. Just yesterday, while down in one of those hollows by a creek, I saw one perched in a tree. As I got closer, he chose to fly to a different tree, treating me to his effortless flight. The barred owl is a beautiful bird, and I'm glad to know that I've been in their company all trek long.","Island Pond

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548961,"What a difference a day makes. Yesterday, in New York, the AT headed south and southwest, crossing a number of rocky summits. Today, right after moving into New Jersey, the AT changed its bearing ninety degrees to instead head west and northwest, and it had an immediate impact on the terrain. The ups and downs decreased, as did the number of rocks inhabiting the trail. For one five-mile stretch, the trail was completely flat as it passed through the areas containing the Wawayanda and Pochuck Creeks. Later on, it went flat again for three miles when it walked the boundary of the Wallkill Reserve. This northern part of New Jersey just across the New York border, is quite beautiful and serene. It features extensive boardwalks and bog bridges, and does its best to make you rethink your impressions of the state. After toiling yesterday, I found today's hike quite appealing. My legs were pretty tired from a week's worth of climbing and descending, and the respite they were given today was much appreciated. By day's end, I had logged 22.2 miles and felt great when I pulled into Unionville, NY, just over the border. I chose to walk the half-mile into town to enjoy a real dinner and to take advantage of the town's hospitality. Unionville kindly allows hikers to pitch their tents near the village office, which I thought was great until I realized that the floodlights that illuminated the adjacent playground weren't going off.

Over the course of the day's first eight miles, the trail would climb in excess of 1,000 feet to reach High Point, not surprisingly, New Jersey's highest point. Despite the gain in altitude, the trail was very moderately sloped and the climb was gentle on my tiring body. As it had been all week, the weather was again stupendous. Since leaving Cornwall Bridge, CT, eight days ago, I have logged over 145 miles, and I can feel the effects. It's definitely time for a bit of rest, and, with thunderstorms forecast for Sunday, I've pulled into Matamoras, PA, just across the New Jersey and New York borders in the Tri-State Region, to zero.

I didn't mind at all starting off the day under my umbrella. It had been so long since I had hiked in inclement weather that it was almost fun. The rain lasted until 10:30 am, but did little to fill creeks and streams. I'm afraid its impact on the water situation will be limited. With the highest elevations in New Jersey now behind me, the trail is on a slow glide path to the Delaware Water Gap and Pennsylvania, where I will find myself tomorrow afternoon. Today, though, New Jersey gave me an easy day to remember it by, with the trail going completely flat for miles in certain places, and rolling gently in others. For long stretches, there weren't even any rocks on the trail. I was just flying for most of the day, and didn't feel I was pushing it at all. When I arrived at my campsite, I had clocked 22.5 miles and felt I could do a few more. I even carried four liters of water for the final three miles, and thought almost nothing of it. This relative flatness will continue for the next ten days or so. Unfortunately, AT lore has it that the trail will get very, very rocky, to the point where it will become annoying. I've now heard so much about Pennsylvania's rocks that I can't wait to get there to see for myself. My sense is that for NoBos coming out of Virginia and Maryland, the change to Pennsylvania is likely striking, adding to the perceived difficulty. But for me, who has already seen the rockiness of Maine and New Hampshire, I wonder if I will be equally taken aback. Tomorrow, when I cross the Delaware River and head into Pennsylvania, it will start to become clear.","Deckertown Turnpike

I continue to rise at 6:00 am each morning, even though it is now dark at that hour. By 6:30, I can usually see just fine. Not today. Pea soup. Even though the rain stopped yesterday morning, this morning's fog had all the rocks and leaves wet, and I had to be extra careful in making my way down the trail. I had fifteen miles of New Jersey hiking to finish off, including the 1,000 foot drop down to the Delaware River at the Delaware Water Gap. I wanted to polish off those miles in time to allow me to climb the 1,000 feet back up the Pennsylvania side and get a few more miles down the trail. After a slow start due to the wet trail conditions, I got rolling and was pleasantly surprised at the gentle grade that the trail maintained down to the river. I made terrific time through the last miles in New Jersey, and pulled into the little village of Delaware Water Gap, PA, at 1:00 pm. In the process of getting there, I walked across the bridge that carries I-80 over the Delaware River. The pedestrian lane, marked with white blazes, was just feet from the traffic, and each tractor trailer that rumbled by had the bridge swaying. It took me a good twenty minutes to cross the entire span, and the noise and wind caused by the traffic was jarring. After my usual peanut butter on tortillas lunch, I started the climb back up out of the Water Gap, arriving at my chosen campsite by 5:00 pm. Once the fog finally burned off around noon, the rest of the day was quite nice, suggesting that my remaining two days on the trail this week will be done under pleasant conditions. After I finish hiking on Thursday, I am heading to see my daughter, Holly, for Parents Weekend, and I will be taking both Friday and Saturday off.

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549211,"Today, I got my first extended taste of Pennsylvania's rocks. If this were to be my only helping, I wouldn't really mind. Having said that, the trail conditions weren't as bad as I had imagined they would be. Yes, the sharp, angular rocks set on their edges and poking up at the bottom of my shoes were at times uncomfortable. But the worst stretches of the rocks didn't go on forever, and there were plenty of times today when the trail was no worse than what I had found in New York and New Jersey. Of course, I'm going on just one day's experience, but I have a feeling that all will be just fine. Weather conditions continue to be fairy tale-like, each day better than the previous one. Today, starting out with a killer sunrise (photo), featured blue skies and seventies, with a freshening breeze kicker. The topography through which the trail now runs is uniquely Pennsylvanian. With long, flat stretches running at 1,500 feet above sea level, there simply aren't the continual ups and downs that are the hallmark of the Appalachian Trail. It's as if Pennsylvania didn't get the memo. Every once in a while, you come to a gap and must drop down and then climb back up, but one can go for ten miles and more and literally see no more than 50 or 100 feet of elevation change. With such flatness, the rocks are a little easier to take in stride. The water situation has not improved, and likely will not, for the remainder of my time on the trail. Still, it's not dire out here. Each day brings a different solution set. For instance, today I planned my hike around two water sources that I knew were good. I purposely tented last night near a shelter that is served by a well. Filling up in the morning, I knew I could then make it to the next confirmed water source, a spring, fourteen miles away. The only drag was that the spring, running cool, clear and abundantly, was 3/4 of a mile off the trail, and quite a bit down hill. Normally, in other circumstances, I would simply skip the opportunity to walk 1.5 miles round-trip for water, but not here in Pennsylvania. I filled up four liters and carried them the next six miles to the campsite where I am spending the night. Tomorrow morning, I will start hiking with two of those liters in my pack, and they will carry me through the ten miles to the next confirmed water source. As I approached my campsite at 4:30 today, I heard my friend, the barred owl, call out to me. It seemed a little early in the day to hear him, but I was happy for the warm welcome.","Campsite just before Kirkridge Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549275,"Today was an interesting one, full of extremes. After a pleasant evening passed at the Delps campsite, I started out hiking amongst a decreasing dose of rocks, made all the better by my attitude towards them: they're simply the latest of various, but conquerable, challenges thrown at me during my trek. Under another day of blue skies and plentiful sunshine, the trail was again flat for some number of miles, and, as I approached Lehigh Gap, where the AT crosses the Lehigh River at Palmerton, PA, I was cruising. In addition to hosting the AT, the ridge above Palmerton is a Superfund site, where the EPA has been working for decades to remediate the impact of past zinc smelting operations. Given the magnitude of the environmental damage, reforestation is stubbornly slow. Before diving 1,000 feet for the gap, the trail runs quite exposed along this ridge, offering the sun an opportunity to blast away at hikers. With temperatures destined for the mid-eighties, I was happy to be crossing this section mid-morning. As I started my climb down off the top of the ridge, where trees had yet to take root despite decades of EPA coaxing, I encountered a most unexpected delight: a trailbed of grass. For more than two miles, I traveled without rocks or roots impeding my progress. I was also in the shade, the upper ridge protecting me from the rising sun. Carved into the side of the hill as part of the remediation effort, this part of the trail was a welcome relief from the last twenty miles of rocks, and from the exposed ridge, allowing me to recharge for the upcoming steep drop to the river. That 1,000-foot drop, over large boulders utterly open to the sun's rays, was difficult in places and slightly reminiscent of certain descents in the White Mountains. Except that I was in the middle of a Superfund site and not the Presidential Range. Once I crossed the river, I had to climb the 1,200 feet back up the other side of the gap. However, this western side had not seen zinc smelting and its environmental damage, so I walked under tree cover over a trail whose grade was much more moderate. Once back on top of the ridge, the trail flattened out and I resumed my pre-gap pace. By 2:00, I had put in fifteen miles to arrive at Lehigh Furnace Gap, not much of a gap at all, but a gravel road does pass over the ridge at this point. I had arranged for Enterprise to pick me up in my rental car here, and, after signing the paperwork, I was on my way to Richmond, VA, to see Holly for Parents Weekend. Now, Richmond lies five hours from Lehigh Furnace Gap, by way of Washington, DC, and some of the East's most dense traffic. Coming out of the woods, I felt out of place behind the wheel at sixty miles an hour. My iPhone did its best to direct me around the trouble spots, but of course I still sat in periods of traffic. Not surprisingly, I found myself thinking at times, ""Which way back to the woods?""Still, experience took over, and I arrived safely, excited to see Holly, share two days with her, and learn the latest about her life.","Delps Campsite

Unfortunately, the nice sunny weather that previously dominated the forecast seems to have gone the way of the hot temperatures, as rain is moving in on Wednesday and looks to be hanging around through Saturday. We'll see what actually happens. As my Appalachian adventure begins to wind down, I've found myself cycling among three feelings: elation, relief, and a sense of mourning.The elation is the easy one. I've often been teary-eyed on the trail just thinking about how wonderful it will feel when I complete my thru-hike, and that moment is rapidly approaching. I can't wait. I am so incredibly proud of myself for taking this on, and here I stand on the threshold of succeeding. The relief I am feeling stems from beating the odds. Only one in four who attempt a thru-hike complete their journey. Many abandon their quest due to sickness, injury or a family matter. I don't want to spike the ball too early, but, so far, I have been lucky. And, already, a sense of mourning is beginning to settle in. However, I am not mourning the end of the hike; in fact, I am quite ready to be back home with Alison. Rather, I am beginning to mourn the loss of direction that the AT has provided me these past two years. During the eighteen months I spent researching, planning and preparing for my hike, my life was guided by a checklist. I knew my goal. All I had to do was compile the necessary steps and work my way through the list. There were no big decisions to make, no important life questions to answer. Once I committed to tackling the AT, the AT took control of my life and I simply followed. For the last five months of hiking, it's been even simpler: follow the white blazes. The trail has led me; I am simply following.It's been a pleasure to surrender to the trail. To let go. To live in the moment. To know that I needn't make any large or life decisions.

The rain started in earnest well before daybreak. I was on the trail by 7:30 am, and, at that point, it was coming down fairly well, a good, soaking rain. By 9:00 am, it had increased to a drenching rain. The trail was a torrent, and my feet were quickly gushing about in my shoes. The temperature held in the high fifties throughout the day, and my fingers, quite wet in the morning, were cold. But the rest of me, particularly those parts shielded by my umbrella, were nice and toasty. By 11:00 am, the rain had stopped, and the day turned into a big, bold, blustery one, the kind I adore. My body heat dried out my hiking shirt and shorts, and all that remained wet were my feet. The terrain was a nice mix of some decent climbs, some ridge running, and a good dose of pleasant woods walking. Of course, I waited for those infamous Pennsylvania rocks to make things more difficult. The funny thing, though, is the rocks never really made their expected appearance. In fact, it was hard to tell I was in Pennsylvania! I know I'm not done with the rocks, but, boy, was it nice to have a day off from them. There were some spots that were indeed a bit rocky, but, in the scheme of things, it just wasn't bad today. That made all the difference. I enjoyed myself tremendously, morning rain and all, and, by the time I stopped, I had covered 24.1 miles, my longest day yet of the trek. Even better, I have ended up at Peters Mountain Shelter, which, given the forecast for more rain tonight and tomorrow morning, will keep me high and dry. It's 8:30 pm, and I'm the only one here, so my chances of a good night's sleep are pretty significant. With all the rain and accompanying winds, I saw plenty of downed limbs, branches and leaves throughout the woods today. Then, around lunchtime, I witnessed something new. A rather large tree, buffeted by the day's winds, was uprooted and began to fall. Mesmerized, I watched it come crashing down across the trail, no more than ten feet in front of me. Clearly, I should have reacted more responsibly and moved back, but I saw that I was not in its direct downward path, and, besides, I was taken by its fall, slowly gaining speed as it came to earth. Landing with a large thud, it bounced a bit and I watched as a large branch broke off from the impact and landed at my feet. Since leaving Connecticut, the AT has moved more west than south. Tomorrow, I pass through Duncannon, Pennsylvania, where, once over the Susquehana River, the trail turns to head more directly south on its way to Harper's Ferry, WV.

I laid awake in the shelter, listening to successive waves of heavy rain, wondering how wet it would be at daybreak. When I made my way out of the shelter to start hiking at 7:00 am, the rain took a breather. That was quite welcome, since it would allow me to get a little body heat generated before I had to deal with the cooling effects of rain. By 8:00 am, my furnace was stoked, and the rain returned. It rained for the most part all day long, but not as heavily as yesterday. It remained cool, mid fifties, and, without a drenching rain, I remained quite comfortable. Around mid-day, I crossed the Susquehanna and arrived in Duncannon. I didn't hang around long as I had my sights set on a shelter 22.3 miles from where I slept last night. With luck, I could make it there by 4:00. By ""luck,"" I mean two things: one, that it wouldn't rain harder (it didn't), and two, that I wouldn't have to contend with too many rocks. On the rocks front, it was definitely more trying than yesterday, but I'd seen worse. So, I continued to motor along, staying mostly dry and keeping a good humor about the trail conditions. I got to Darlington Shelter at about 4:30. From what I understand, I have now withstood the worst of the rocks. From here on out, they are not as big a factor. I hope that proves to be the case. With rain again expected tonight and tomorrow, I am happy to be under roof. I have a relatively short day planned tomorrow and will be in Boiling Springs, PA, for a late lunch. I have planned my last(!) zero for Sunday, and I'll be back at it on Monday. Right now, the forecast for my last week on the trail looks great!","Peters Mountain Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549957,"This week, it rained Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights, and during the day on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Knowing that I had so few days left on the trail, I was a bit bummed by the prospect of being wet for a good deal of them. But a funny thing happened on the way to the finish line. I hitched up my knickers and found a way to enjoy the relative adversity of rain, rocks and cool weather. Today, I again awoke to rain, and I thanked my lucky stars that I had spent the night in the shelter. Breaking ""camp"" from within a shelter on a rainy morning is a complete breeze compared to doing it ""outside,"" with a wet tent. This morning proved to be the coolest of my recent wet days, with temperatures hovering in the low fifties. Waiting an extra twenty minutes to start hiking to let a band of rain pass, I was on the trail by 7:30 am, and hustling to get my blood flowing. I would not get the benefit of a climb to help get warm; the trail today would alternate between flat and flatter. In the past, I have spoken of how flat (and rocky) parts of Pennsylvania have been. Hiking along 1,500-foot ridges, the elevation changed very little. The trail today was just as flat, if not flatter, but I walked through farms and flood plains at just 500 feet above sea level, without a rock in sight. Despite the continuing rain, it was delightful. This part of Pennsylvania farm country is just beautiful, full of hay bales, cows, horses, corn, beans and pasture. It was a welcome change from the woods-dominated ridges that had defined my first week in Pennsylvania. Given the easy terrain, I made terrific time and pulled into the town of Boiling Springs at 12:45 pm, after 14.3 miles. With its post office scheduled to close at 12:00 pm, I was surprised to see the lights on as I passed. Poking my head inside to find two customers still being waited on, I asked the gentleman behind the counter if I could pick up a box. He beckoned me in. Ah, the joy of small towns. The ladies were needing some extra service and the postal employee was all about helping them, even if it called for staying open well past closing time. I picked up my last food drop from Alison and headed to lunch. After my meal and strawberry milkshake, the latter having been a trail favorite of mine for some time, I was picked up by Kit, the owner of the Pheasant Field B&B, who, with her husband, Robin, runs a fabulous place. I was thrilled to arrive at their lovely place, and quickly jumped in a hot shower. As much as I have enjoyed the last few days, I am very happy to now be the beneficiary of heat, running water and a warm, dry bed. I look forward to my zero, the last of my trek, here tomorrow.","Darlington Shelter

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549960,"To my Followers,Today, I am zeroing in Boiling Springs, PA, my last day of rest before finishing my hike on Saturday. With just 98 miles left in my Appalachian Trail adventure, I don't want to spend this journal entry talking about the trail, the weather, my plans or me. Rather, I would like to talk about you. To date, my on-line journal has been viewed almost 80,000 times, and has received over 200 emails. Countless other emails have been sent to my personal account. I have received impromptu visits along the trail, and have been treated to trail magic by Angels. In addition, Alison has seen and heard from so many of you asking after me, and she has passed on your well wishes. You have no idea how much I have appreciated your interest, enthusiasm and concern, nor can you know how much it has helped me succeed in this rather audacious undertaking. When all is said and done, I will have been out here for 170 days, climbing mountain after mountain, withstanding all that Mother Nature has, and missing my family and a life that I rather enjoyed. You have encouraged, queried, commented, shared, inhaled and exhaled, suffered, conquered, laughed and cried every step with me. You have picked me up and carried me along difficult stretches. You have made this journey more fun, bearable, worthwhile, life-defining and special. My journal started out as a way for me to capture a few thoughts and feelings and to offer updates to the few family and friends that insisted they would follow me. I had no hopes or dreams for it. Clearly, I enjoy writing, the process of finding the right word or phrase to capture a mood or feeling. But I'm only a good writer when I have something to say, and someone to whom to say it.From the beginning, your combined reaction to my journal has been nothing short of incredible. You have rocked my world. As a result, I have written with joy, and I am as proud of my journal as I am with the (near) completion of my 2,189 mile trek. You are the sole reason that the journal has turned out so well. As I return to my ""normal"" life, I will miss the affirmations that I have been so fortunate to receive from you these past six months. That we are now connected in a different way than before is a very happy outcome for me. I will keep that in my heart for the years to come. So, to each and every one of you, thank you dearly from this very appreciative AT hiker. May you each find the true color in your life. With love and gratitude,Blue","Boiling Springs, PA

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550033,"After another fabulous breakfast at Pheasant Field B&B (I highly recommend this place!), I was back on the trail. Leaving Boiling Springs, I passed through a few more miles of the Cumberland Valley (photo) before heading back into the woods and up on a ridge. Despite my restful zero, I just couldn't get out of third gear today. I could tell I was tired as I kept kicking rocks with my right foot, not picking it up high enough to clear them. In an attempt to help, I took a short detour off the trail to a general store that served Hershey's ice cream. Ordering another strawberry milkshake, I was hoping that it and an early lunch might get my engine revving. In the end, I'm not sure the milkshake helped, but it sure was delicious. I was able to put in 19.3 miles to arrive at Pine Grove State Park, a beautiful spot. With shower facilities, bathrooms and a water fountain, the park had all I needed to cleanly and comfortably climb into my tent to rest up for tomorrow. With a good night's sleep, I am hoping to find a bit more in my tank. Today's weather was greatly improved, with blue skies, some clouds and temperatures around 70. Tomorrow promises to be a carbon copy.","Boiling Springs, PA

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550054,"What an incredible day of hiking! Everything seemed to come together, and I thoroughly enjoyed my last full day in Pennsylvania. Waking up in Pine Grove State Park, I was greeted by temperatures in the mid-forties as cool air had settled down into the park's lower elevations overnight. Luckily, I had to climb back out of the grove in the morning, allowing me to get warm quickly. Once back up on the ridge, I found a generally flat trail that moved through some beautiful pine barrens (photo), and, once again, perfect hiking weather. Better yet, I seemed to find my mojo again after it went missing yesterday, and I moved easily and quickly down the trail. All in all, a wonderful time. Towards the end of the day, as I lugged three liters of water up Rocky Mountain to the shelter there, I was startled out of my hiking reverie by a sound I had yet to hear on the trail. Fortunately, it served as an alarm and it stopped me dead in my tracks. There, no more than a stride or two in front of me, stretching across the trail, was my first rattlesnake. Once I stopped, he ceased his rattling and my heart settled down a bit. I took a few pictures as he moved off the trail, and then started to move around him. With my first step, however, he quickly took up his rattling again, and I hustled to leave him behind. Looking at my photos of him, I now realize how beautiful he was. But I must admit that I wasn't too focused on his snakeskin at the time. Running across him was much more scary than any of my encounters with black bears. Part of that is probably due to my proximity to him, a few feet at most, and part due to the very distinct, and very frightening, sound of his rattle. Tomorrow, I cross over into Maryland, the fourteenth and final state of my journey. (The last mile of my trek will be back in West Virginia, where I was in mid-July before jumping up to Maine.)This continuing progress all seems a bit unreal. With my move into Maryland, my time left on the trail will be easily tallied in hours. It doesn't seem that long ago that I thought in terms of months, and then weeks.","Pine Grove State Park, PA

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550091,"Last night, thinking I would again be alone for the evening, I was very pleasantly surprised when Legs showed up with two other SoBo hikers. Alison and I met him in Rangeley, Maine, back in late July and had lunch together. We're both so glad that he is still on the trail, and thriving. Getting another early start, I thought that I wouldn't need all day to cover my intended 19.8 miles to Raven Rock Shelter. So, I took some extra time at lunch, and had a few nice conversations on the trail with some local hikers during the day. I find that I am quite happy to talk about my impending completion with anyone who expresses an interest!Today was cooler than recent days, certainly not moving out of the sixties, and probably staying in the low sixties. It was again ideal hiking weather and my luck seems to be holding out. The next two days are forecasted to be beautiful, and nightly temperatures will remain in the fifties. Saturday, when I hike three miles to finish up, might be a bit damp, but that's quite all right. As I am writing this, a barred owl has started to hoot, and I will so miss hearing their calls when my time on the trail ends. Tonight, I am in Maryland, having crossed the border from Pennsylvania this afternoon. I am staying in my tent at Raven Rock Shelter, and, like most nights over the past few weeks, I am alone for the evening.

Tomorrow, I will hike thirteen miles, completing them by lunch, and, on Saturday, I will finish the final three, falling into the waiting arms of my wife and daughter. Today's 20.6 miles were rather uneventful, if you can call being on the threshold of completing a thru-hike ""uneventful."" The weather again was stupendous, the trail not particularly tough, and my legs somewhat tired. Not wanting to turn an ankle this late in the game, I slowed down in various spots and took my time going downhill. Late in the afternoon, I came across a Maryland state park with a shower, and, after four days of good hiking, was able to wash my hair and perk myself up considerably. The walk from that state park to tonight's shelter was only two miles, so I actually feel quite clean and civilized lying here in my tent and sleeping bag. This is my last night sleeping out on the trail. Tomorrow, after I finish my thirteen miles, I grab a ride and check into a hotel, awaiting the arrival of Alison and Holly around 6:00 pm. We'll have dinner together in Harper's Ferry and spend the night at the hotel. On Saturday morning, Alison will then run me out to where I left the trail, and I'll walk the final three miles. Alison and Holly will be waiting to greet me. What a way to finish!I'm excited beyond words to complete my thru-hike, but, then again, I haven't really come to grips with this being the end. For five and a half months, I have lived and loved this nomadic life.   I have also missed my family and friends, and the life I lead before. I know it's time to return, and I am thrilled by that prospect. Still, it's hard to process it all, and I expect it will take me some time. Happy Anniversary, dear Alison.

This morning even dawned quite warm, in the high 50s. I completed today's 12.5 miles without issue (or injury!), and have just 3.5 miles left for tomorrow morning. Today's hike was not terribly noteworthy, although I got a great view of the Potomac River (photo) before I dropped down off the ridge towards Harper's Ferry. I have yet to cross the Potomac (that's part of tomorrow's short hike), so I am still in Maryland. As excited as I am to finish tomorrow, my prevailing feeling today was one of tiredness. Body and mind know that the end is near, and my legs are yearning to ease up. I've had to mentally push all week long to stay in the game. Fortunately, my desire to finish strongly has beaten back any other thoughts or ideas. Having said that, I am definitely ready to go home, and look forward to it. Rain is expected for tomorrow morning and that's fine. Perhaps even fitting. Alison will drop me at the trailhead and then wait with Holly at the finish line.","Rocky Run Shelters

Having finished at Harper's Ferry, WV, I'm in the airport at nearby Baltimore to catch a flight home to Rhode Island. Alison and Holly are with me. In a steady rain, I was met at the end of my final mile by my wife and daughter in appropriately blue Power Ranger suits, joined by my childhood friend, Rich, and his wife, Mary Kim (photo). I didn't expect the ""super hero"" welcome, nor the addition of Rich and Mary Kim. Homemade signs marked the occasion, and our son, Sandy, joined over FaceTime. Seeing the welcoming party, I could no longer hold back the tears, and, stopping twenty feet short of the collected crowd, I let 'em go. It was a perfect way to end the trek. At this point, I can't unjumble my emotions and thoughts into anything comprehensible. I know there's relief in there, and pride, and a great deal of thanks to all of you. The sense of accomplishment that I know I will feel is not yet out at the surface. I'm guessing that I'm too tired to sift through it all, and, frankly, not ready to do so. Holly is coming home with Alison and me for her four-day Fall break, and I look forward to simply being in their company. I am repelling any effort to think about what I need to do after five and a half months away; that'll come all too quickly without my encouraging it. Having said that, I will be making a visit to my chiropractor quite soon, and I need to get back to my pre-hike stretching regimen as soon as possible. Once I feel capable, I'll begin my sessions at Fit Body again, in an attempt to properly direct the weight I know I will be putting back on. (When I get home, I'll be interested to see what the scale says.)As I go through the process of re-entry, I will be adding more posts to my journal. The frequency with which I do so will not match my past daily routine. I'm thinking that I will post an update on the first of every month, making it easy to remember for those of you who want to continue to follow me. I'll also be making a gear post soon, detailing those items that I carried with me or wore. What I will not do is jump to fill my life back up.

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551125,"It's been three weeks since I completed my thru-hike and arrived back home. In that time, I've found myself surprised, content, nostalgic, tired, pleased and confounded. In hindsight, I was extremely well prepared for my trek. However, I was not as well informed about the challenges of post-hike re-entry. First of all, my legs are just plain exhausted....still. Each morning, I hobble out of bed. Any time I sit or lie down for any extended period, I hobble again. While my feet are no longer swollen, I find that my soles are painful, especially when walking barefoot. To compound matters, my knees are sore, and my quads tight. I have been seeing a massage therapist, who expects several more weeks of recovery. Interestingly, during my trek, I developed muscles in my legs where I didn't expect them, but think that my quads actually withered somewhat over the five plus months. Whether they actually weakened or are just exhausted, it's hard to know. What's clear, though, is that I am not ready to start any kind of work-out yet. I have been walking each day, up to four miles, which is generally good, but not without soreness the next day. I am just now starting a stretching regimen, but am amazed at how less flexible I am compared to when I left for the trail in April. I am taking it very slowly, focusing for the time being on loosening my quads. In summary, the physical challenge of hiking the AT is now fully sinking in. As I reported earlier, I didn't get sick or hurt during the trek. I guess I was lulled into believing that I would get home and just pick up where I left off. I simply didn't expect an extended recovery period. But I am now reminding myself daily that it's only been three weeks and that another month of recovery is wholly appropriate for what I put my 57-year old body through. I've also found that I've grown nostalgic about my time on the trail sooner than I expected. Towards the end of my trek, I was truly fired up about finishing and returning home. And being home with Alison has indeed been fabulous. But I find myself missing the simplicity of the trail, the pleasure of being in nature, the joy of listening to the orchestra of night sounds, the pride of self-sufficiency, and the thrill of accomplishing a long-held dream. Like many others, I cannot wait for this presidential campaign to be over. I am so glad that I missed most of it. The past few weeks have been very hard to sit through, and it's like a cloud has been hanging over me during my time at home. So much negativity that stands in stark contrast to the joys of being trail-bound. Perhaps I should have slowed down and stretched my trek to last into November!I now see my AT adventure to be a real demarcation point in my life. Pre-trek, I found my days to be full, but my life missing a sense of fulfillment. Now, post-hike, I see clearly that I am moving towards a more fulfilling life that does not insist upon full days. This is exactly where I want to be. I recognize that my completion of the AT is enabling this new-found outlook, as a sense of peace and maturity seems to be taking hold. I have great hope for this next stage in my life. My time on the AT was a gift, a gift from myself to myself. I worked hard to embrace the opportunity and am so proud of its positive outcome. Amidst the physical challenges of recovery, I sense a growing completeness in myself that was not present before. I will post another update on December 1.

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552782,"Yesterday, I drove our son, Sandy, to the Boston airport to fly back to California after the holidays. Traffic was awful, and, on the way home, I put on some music to liven up the slowly-passing miles. Without necessarily making the obvious connection, I chose Bruce Springsteen's album, The River.While hiking the AT, I often sang to myself. I landed on a repertoire of four tunes that I sang in continual rotation: The Lovin' Spoonful's ""Darling Be Home Soon"", and Bruce's ""Thunder Road"", ""The River"" and ""Drive All Night"", the last two appearing on the album I chose for my drive home from the airport. Listening to these songs transported me right back to my trek. I felt the wind in my hair, the rain on my face and the cool of the mornings. I cried. In ""Drive All Night"", Springsteen writes: Through the wind, Through the rain, the snow,You've got my love....Heart and soul. On the trail, I was singing it to Alison, whom I was missing, particularly acutely towards the end. But upon hearing the song today, I realize that I was also singing it to the trail itself. Through the wind, Through the rain, the snow,You've got my love....Heart and soul. I haven't felt moved to write since my last entry, on November 1, even though I said I would update my post-hike journal once a month. Since then, Alison and I have been quite busy, with the holidays, and traveling, and some family events. As a consequence, I quickly moved from life on the trail back to a prior existence. While what we were doing was ""all good"", I could sense my longing for simplicity, for nature, for the AT. The trail captured my attention, occupied my thoughts, and animated my every movement for almost six months. It provided me a blueprint to follow, a cause to pursue, an enjoyment to experience. Walking away from it has been hard, and, being busy enough with other pursuits, I haven't really wanted to dwell on my loss. But, dwell I did today, listening to Springsteen. At one point, the traffic had almost come to a complete standstill, so I pulled off the highway onto the shoulder, snuck into the woods, ducked behind a tree and answered nature's call. The sun was setting, the wind was up and the temperature dropping. Standing there, in the trees, amongst nature's bounty, it all felt so familiar. And I was missing it all.

Blue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558255,"This summer, I will be speaking to several groups about my 2016 trek. Here is a piece I wrote to help promote one of those talks.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In April of 2016, I stood atop Springer Mountain in northwestern Georgia, readying to take my first step on the Appalachian Trail. Running the length of the country’s easternmost mountain range, the AT (as it is popularly known), climbs summit upon summit, and descends valley upon valley, for 2,189 miles on its path from Georgia to Maine.Two years in the planning, and twenty years in the dreaming, my expedition on the AT would prove the importance of preparation and perseverance. It would showcase the power of setting an intention, of resolutely envisioning an outcome. Above all else, it would be the adventure of a lifetime.What brought me to the summit of Springer in my fifty-seventh year, ready to hike the AT’s every mile? What moved me to set out on a six-month test of will during which I knew I would be cold, wet, tired, hot and hungry? What did I encounter along the way that helped reaffirm my place in this world?John Muir said of his numerous adventures in nature that, “Going out….is really going in.” I hiked by myself during the days, at times literally passing no one else from sunrise to sunset. I spent a lot of time inside myself, constantly scanning how I was feeling physically, mentally, spiritually. Other times, I lost myself in song, singing the same few numbers again and again. But what I will remember most is the insanely empowering feeling of standing at a mountain’s base, staring upwards at its long-off summit, and thinking nothing else than, “All right….let’s go.” With no trace of trepidation or uncertainty. Knowing that I would never again be in better physical shape for climbing. And, I will forever remember the support I received on my hike. From “trail angels” along the way who relished the opportunity to help hikers as they tackled the AT. From my wife, who steadfastly kept me in the game and allowed me to live selfishly for six months. And, from all of you who followed my on-line journal, cheered me on with words of encouragement, and walked with me every step.During my time on the trail, I encountered the many moods of Mother Nature, shared the forest with black bears, snakes and barred owls, and soaked in the friendship of fellow hikers newly met. I carried all that I needed on my back, and nothing I didn’t need. Before I left, I knew that my life was turning, that it was to be henceforth guided by my beliefs in simplicity, community, nature and beauty. I anticipated that the AT would grandly reinforce these tenets, and I indeed returned with my life’s direction confirmed and strengthened.",,A Prelude to Speaking,"Mar 31, Fri",0
