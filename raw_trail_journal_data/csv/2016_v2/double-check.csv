The day was hot and sunny and so I decided to linger in town and start out after the temperature fell a bit. I happened upon the O. Winston Link Museum by accident. If you are only slightly interested in the era of steam locomotives, then go there. Worth the $6.00 admission.Caught a city bus to VA 311, bought some cold medication (Greyhound plus bad cold really sucks) and caught a ride to the trail with Bill, a retired GE employee living in Catawba. I met ridge runner Dan then fell running across 311, trying to dodge cars. The evening walk to John's Spring was nice, both weather and trail-wise. Hit the shelter about sundown and talked with thru-hiker Bruce before setting up my tent. Lay down, closed my eyes and that was it for me.","Roanoke Greyhound Sta.

Beautiful day. I ate, washed clothes and hung out while a stream of hikers came through. Finally out by 4:00 (pm). Stopped at McAffee Knob and caught perfect views (and a chill) then Campbell Shelter by maybe 6:00. The place was full of tents, but I got a spot behind the shelter. Dinner with Ryan, who manages the Peaks of Otter campground on the BRP and Gary who is hiking home to MA. I took more cold medicine and was out by sundown.

Got a little wheezy going uphill onto Tinker Cliffs, but feeling better overall. Stopped at closed Lambert's Meadow Shelter (bear problems) to use the privy and talked with thru-hiker Sidequest and another guy whom I taken a picture for earlier.It seemed like a long haul to reach the temporary campsite, but I made it by maybe 4:00.

He had camped just south, at the first temporary site and was meeting a friend in town. I started out late, expecting an easy walk...my third time through this section and it still surprised me. Sprinkles must have been sitting in Taco Bell, cursing me last night!I got into town and finished up all my chores before noon. Then I passed Supercuts. The night before, I'd gotten my ponytail caught in my tent zipper again and now my sweaty, dirty hair was just plain hot and the temperature was in the mid-nineties. So I did it, and there are no words to describe how good that felt to walk out of there minus 2 pounds of hair. I tipped the poor girl who cut it well.Pizza Hut and then back out. I made the shelter about 4:00 and kind of got off on the wrong foot with a group of thru-hikers there. They left after dinner and I set up down the hill beside a big log with orange fungi growing on it. A big group of Quakers came in and took all the water left in the cistern. Luckily I'd carried mine up. I ate dinner with two pairs of section hiking couples and gave away my hair ties.","Temporary Campsite South of Daleville

Soaked my feet in the stream and talked awhile with SOBO Big Country. Wilson Creek Shelter came up about lunchtime and I decided to stop there after only a six-mile day.Lots of people I'd met earlier came through, including Sprinkles, who wasn't too ticked-off about the totally wrong ""it's all-downhill"" advice I'd given her on the stretch of trail from the temporary campsite into Daleville. By dinnertime, thru-hikers Angry and Ninja stopped in and began cooking. Ninja sauteed ""chicken of the Woods"" he'd harvested that day at the last shelter...""Hey, did the mushrooms look like this?"" I showed him my pictures, and he verified they were the very ones I'd slept beside. He shared some and I have to say they tasted a lot like Morels! A Swiss hiker, Alpiner came in later and the three thru-hikers debated on going on because of an approaching storm, but ended up staying in the shelter. I'd set my tent up on a soft, mossy area under some pines. A big storm did set in, but I stayed dry.","Fullhardt Knob Shelter

I played mental games with myself that day, imagining I was was only one on the world while I conjured up explanations: zombie apocalypse, the rapture thing, wandering into an alternative universe--staring at what might have been the same section of trail every time I looked up became part of story. (Hiking alone can really kick imaginations into high gear). Anyway, this day was almost as solitary, but with fog so thick I could not see half-way across the Blue Ridge Parkway wherever the trail crossed it. One hiker passed me mid-morning, hunched over and head down to avoid the stinging rain. We barely waved to each other. A group of motorcycles thundered past, invisible yet somewhere nearby on the cloud-enveloped ridge...I could hear the Twilight Zone music in my head.No pictures to share, but just imagine hiking through a giant, wet cotton ball and that would sum up this day's views along the BRP.

Breakfast in the tent and then I was out behind most of the thru-hikers. Everyone seemed headed for civilization, leaving me a bit sad at the thought of a solitary and wet July 4th. I'd bought a new AWOL guide, and it listed Middle Creek Campground as a resupply option. The ""bacon cheeseburger and milkshake"" description hooked me.I called the campground from Jennings Creek, and not only did they have campsites available, but they would come to pick me up, too! My day improved mightily, along with the weather. Got everything dried out. I swam in the pool, and ate, non-stop, on the store's front porch along with thru-hiker Chipotle and a guy from Montana. Everyone else must have read AWOL because the bacon cheeseburgers and milkshakes were flying outta that grille all day long.PJ, the retired editor I'd met earlier, camped next to me. He was now joined by a nephew, Marcus who was doing the next trail section. Sibley, from Pearisburg, came in near the day's end and set up next door to us.

My stay at MCC totaled $48, which included non-stop eating, resupply, and the campsite. I felt lots better after the rest; I was finally kicking the cold I'd hung onto for nearly a month. On my first climb of the day (Fork Mtn) I passed a turtle headed uphill, on the trail. I got a chuckle from wondering which of us would make the top first. The day cleared at about the same time I stopped for lunch at Bryant Ridge Shelter. Sibley was there already, so we both took the time to check out the amazing shelter that sleeps 20. I met a few locals on the way up Floyd Mtn, and the bolus of thru-hikers who had been watching James Bond movies in the campground rec room when I'd left, blew past me. I stopped for the day at Cornelius Creek. Ate dinner on the shelter picnic table with Sibley, PJ and Marcus. Just as I was settled into my tent, I started hearing an odd sound, like someone blowing up an air mattress, but the noise moved quickly from one place to another.

Apple Orchard Mtn, in the clearing below the FAA tower, was a good place for a snack. PJ, Marcus and Sibley thought so, too, and soon we were joined by a Boy Scout troop. Evidently, Sibley had left the scouts a warning about a snake a few days before, and they had sort of adopted her into their troop and given her the name ""Little Bear,"" which she had not mentioned.We all met up again at Thunder Hill Shelter for lunch. As I was packing up to leave, I waved to Sibley and said ""Bye, Little Bear."" The scouts were jubilant,jumping up and down, shouting ""It stuck! Her trail name stuck!""

Of the thirty or so people at the campsite, I made it out first to hike into another fine morning. I passed a SOBO, who also must have gotten an early start, on the long descent to the river. Matts Creek Shelter was a good snack stop. I met the section ridgerunner there and then we were joined by PJ, Marcus, Little Bear and some of the scouts. I had not jumped off to such a big head start, after all!Promising my friends that I would meet them later, with Oreos, I set off for the river. The smell from my own clothes was starting to bother me, but I forewent jumping into any of the perfect swimming spots along the creek in order to stay dry. Just ""stinky"" would probably win out over ""dripping wet and stinky"" when I tried to catch a ride, I imagined.My worries about a ride into Glasgow were all for naught, because Preacher and his wife met me just before the river and offered to give me a lift. They were driving up the trail, hiking bits and pieces as they went. Thankful for their kindness (and the ice water) I waved goodbye after they dropped me in town, and looked for the hiker pavilion. Nice place! Thanks, Glasgow for setting up a place for hikers to pause in. Got showered (with hot water), washed clothes at the laundry place, resupplied, and located that cheeseburger (Dixie Burger at Scoto's--highly recommended BTW). I tried to catch a ride back out, too late in the day, and ended up staying and tenting beside the pavilion. Ate ice cream and watched a softball game!","Marble Springs Campsite

The hiker inside screamed, and out bounced a super-excited, chocolate Labrador retriever, reflective collar and eyes aglow in my headlight beam like tracer bullets, headed straight at me. Before I could manage to straighten up and shout ""STAY!"" I got bowled over and thoroughly licked. Someone across the way yelled and the dog shot back off for home. Reveille, reveille, reveille!After that wake-up call, Troy, the hammock hanger guy, made me a cup of coffee with his French press. Gotta say, it did beat Taster's Choice. I didn't even make it out onto the road before a truck stopped. Ed was headed into work and going my way. He reminded me that I had a big climb up Long Mtn, right out of the gate.Little Bear and the scouts were doing breakfast at John's Hollow Shelter when I passed by. The day was warming up fast and already humid. By the time I made Little Rocky Row, I was dripping sweat. Passed a few familiar tents on the way up and stopped for a snack with Little Bear and her Boy Scout entourage. We could see Thunder Mountain and its FAA tower across the river, looking very distant in the haze. Bluff Mtn was next, and I stopped to put a small trinket on Little Ottie's marker. One of my grandsons was about Ottie's age when he wandered off from his one room schoolhouse and died atop Bluff Mtn in 1891. I called it a short day (maybe 10 miles)at Punch Bowl Shelter and pulled out the Oreos to share. The scouts didn't let any go to waste. Little Bear headed out for a pick-up. She was going to Morocco to work as a teacher later in the summer. The scouts regrouped and left for a campsite near the Pedlar River, and I found a level spot uphill and behind the shelter.

I had another short day planned (sub-ten miles) and I recalled really liking this upcoming section of trail. Clydesdale was still at the shelter when I finally made it down there, and we talked for awhile before we each headed north (me at a much slower pace).A family was playing in the Pedlar River when I crossed the bridge, and we waved to each other. Two women, about my age, stopped to chat while I was eating lunch and fighting off ants at a pine-shaded, flat spot not far from the river. They called themselves Team Slowpoke and were nearly done with a week-long car-hopping, section hike. It was a nice day to walk around the Lynchburg Reservoir and catch views of the mountain-ringed lake from different vantage points. The trail was easy and shaded along Brown Mtn Creek, and I thought of the settlement of freed slaves who lived there during the harsh reconstruction years. The only traces left were stone foundations and information signs.I hit the shelter by about 2:00 and had lunch with Ninja and Angry. I had been running into them a lot. The next section was sketchy for water and included big up-downs, and so I set up my tent next to the creek and saved the climb up Cold Mtn for the following morning. Soaked in the creek and patched some holes in my gear. Later, a group of Quaker kids camped just upstream and around the bend.","Punch Bowl Shelter

A couple who had passed through the night before was camped about half-way up the mountain and there was Ninja's tent atop Bald Mtn. He had planned a big night hike, but didn't make it very far. The sky cleared in time to get spectacular views from Crabtree Meadows. That was a great spot for lunch, surrounded by rolling hills and wildflowers. A group of students from Pittsburgh stopped by and asked if I knew of any other good spots along the trail they might hit on their drive back home. If I'd been thinking, I would have told them ""Sky Meadows State Park."" Oh well.Team Slowpoke passed me and said goodbye as they were headed back home. I'd carried a lot of water so that would not have to detour off trail, and the last couple of miles felt longer than they really were.

I'd gone through my food bag faster than I'd planned because, hey, I got hungry, okay?. I detoured to Spy Rock, but did not climb it because of the fog. The day did clear off, and then I came to a road. Hmm...I actually started uphill towards the Priest and turned to look at the road again. I wanted to see something new, and AWOL described Crabtree Falls as an alternative route that would take me into a campground--and FOOD.I set off down the road feeling a little guilty at diverting off the AT, but with every step came liberation, too. I was doing something different (not as if I have never blue-blazed before), something exciting and fun! The road passed several USFS campsites before it led me to the Crabtree Falls Trailhead. No chance of getting lost on this super-well marked and maintained path, but the signs warning hikers to stay on the trail were a bit ominous, listing the number of deaths (30!) of people who had been swept down the creek and over the falls.
The easy, sun-dappled trail followed the stream until suddenly, I was at the footbridge on top of the falls. A stone and concrete overlook there was the perfect lunch spot. I was scraping the last of my peanut butter onto a tortilla wrapper when three day hikers sat down beside me. We got to talking and it turned out they hiked a lot and knew this area really well. They invited me to back to their campsite for a real lunch and said they'd wait in the parking lot at the foot of the falls. 
The maybe mile-long path along the falls was paved. It had railings and overlooks and was jammed with hundreds of tourists--and for good reason. These are the most spectacular waterfalls east of the Mississippi River. That The Trail passes so close is ironic, because thru-hikers blow right by. Totally worth the side trip.
Josh, Steve, and Ben were waiting, as promised, in Ben's monster truck. They dropped me at the Montebello Campground General Store, where I resupplied enough to make Waynesboro. I wandered through the super-nice campground to find Steve and Ben cooking up sausage, pork chops and scrambled eggs and Josh playing banjo. Had the best breakfast/lunch, overlooking a lake and sharing stories of camping adventures. Josh and Ben are old grade school buddies and Josh's dad, Steve, has been taking them on trips forever. Now, the three get together at Montebello Campground a couple of times a year. (I'm planning on taking grandsons there this summer, BTW.)
My new friends dropped me back at the Tye River bridge (blue, yellow, and white blazes all in one day!) so I skipped a few miles. I heard Ben's truck roaring off as I started uphill, resupplied, happy, and full. 
A tree had fallen over the path to the shelter, and I ran into a nest of bees while trying to scramble over it. I ended up camped at some tent sites, but a big group stayed near the shelter. A huge tree fell in that direction around dinner time and I walked up the trail to see if everyone was okay. They were.

It was time to check out the MAU-HAR Trail.This trail connects Maupin Field and Harpers Creek Shelters and for about a mile, follows a waterfall-filled valley. There are several good campsites along the stream, too. The trail is well-marked and maintained, but it has more of a wilderness feel than the AT--totally worth it! For a change of pace and lots of waterfalls, I recommend taking the MAU-HAR detour.Clouds rolled in by the time I crossed Reeds Gap and I half-considered ducking into Devil's Backbone Brewery, but my feet just wanted to walk. A trail maintainer from Old Dominion was clipping branches along a rocky stretch of trail. He mentioned a bobcat attack that happened on Humpback Mtn a few days before.

otherwise the place was mine, alone, to eat a Cliff Bar and stare out 
into the mist. 
Maggie joined me for lunch at the Turk Mountain Trail

down her pack. She looked like she had been out a few days...and kind of
familiar. It was my friend Free Thinker, from 2011! We had been on Mt.

lives near SNP and spends summers hiking the park's many side trails. I 
was too focused on the promise of blackberry milkshakes at Loft Mtn.

away, was on the path, watching us. When it didn't move, we shouted and
shook our trekking poles in the air. Then a cub scampered across the 
trail into the safety of the surrounding scrub. We backed away, but mama
refused to budge. For a moment, I thought she might charge down the 
hill to chase us off, maybe to show junior how to handle noisy hikers, 
but she stayed put. Cub number two slipped down a pine tree, slick as a fireman down a pole, and made a clean getaway. Mama turned and 
melted into the forest behind her cubs; I felt as if I were watching a
Disney movie. Three bears! I wanted to celebrate the encounter by trail-naming Maggie ""Goldilocks,""  but she balked and we settled on 
just the number ""3"" instead.

up there. Privies, water spigots and picnic tables justified a break,

these in back of the outhouses, were loaded with ripe berries and I

out mountains as it approached. Time to go. 3 left, but I dawdled 
around the gift shop and wrote out postcards. I wasn't sure how to find

booth. She gave me almost step-by-step instructions, but still I wasn't 
sure I was going the right way once I hit white blazes.

at Ivy Creek, who was waiting for an overheated dog to perk back up, 
assured me I was headed north. The first drops hit just as I reached the

Said goodbye to her again, and to 3 who was headed for a pickup point and a wedding. 
Near a road crossing, I happened on and older man clipping back overgrowth along the trail. I called out so that I wouldn't startle him, but he still jumped with surprise once I got alongside.

He snipped the end off an overgrown branch and sighed. ""This used to be my section of trail, though."" I told him that I was enjoying walking on it and thanked him again.

of Maine together back in 2012 and stayed in touch. I'd run into her the year before at Trail Days, in Crocks, on a thru-hike.
She
set out lawn chairs, peaches and beer and we caught up with each 
other's lives. Both of her sons (AT'14 thru-hikers) were on the PCT and 
she was coaching soccer. We hit Elkton for lunch and ate at a 
Christian-themed diner where the BLTs and sweet tea were simply the 
best. (I lifted up the bread to check--no images.) Corky dropped me back
at the trail, and the next few miles just melted away under bright sun 
and cornflower-blue sky. 
I grabbed water at the South River 
Picnic Area and talked with a family while I caught my breath. Their 
five-year-old son wanted to know what I used for a pillow at night, and I
told him ""dirty clothes"" :)  Met a father/son a few miles later who 
were out for a few days, dad had an MFA in creative writing. My feet 
were tired by the time I stopped at Lewis Mtn Campground Store, but ice 
cream and a Moon Pie made everything alright. The same guy was working 
the counter there as when I came through in '11, and he gave The Dude a 
free beer because it was his 21st birthday. We all sang. 
Bearfence had good tent sites and I got set up just ahead of some light rain. Went down to the shelter and talked with Ninja, The Dude and Annie from Germany. Good sleeping weather.","Hightop Mtn

of The Dude (he passed me again right quick out of the gate) and Ninja, who didn't.
Funny how places can bring back memories, because I recalled the 
friends I'd run into on my '11 hike along this stretch of trail, One 
Step, Rainbow & Firestarter, Mr. Black, and Jingles--all flashes now 
between the trees, but for the mist of time. A big group of day hikers 
met me at Booten's Gap. They smelled good and wanted to know what I'd 
eaten for breakfast. 
""Oatmeal,"" I said, and felt the disappointment, as if they'd been discussing hiker diets, and found oatmeal too bland, which it is.
""...and a Moonpie,""
I quickly added. This got a round of cheers and kept the hiker mystique
alive, at least in the minds of a few day hikers.
I blue-blazed 
around the lodge, straight for Big Meadows Wayside. It wasn't quite time
for lunch yet, and so I had another breakfast while I waited for Burger
Time, half-wishing those day hikers could see me now. Wrote some 
postcards and generally lazed about until it was super hot outside. Big 
storm clouds began stacking up while I walked the paved path to the 
campground area, and I made it to the laundry place, literally as the 
first drops fell. I washed clothes and showered through a very 
impressive thunderstorm, gloating the whole time that I'd dodged the 
rain, at least this time. Back out into a clearing afternoon, I walked 
past a few more ghosts and the campsite I'd stayed at with my dad some 
ten years before. A fawn, still sporting a full complement of spots, 
came so close that I could have touched it. 
The temperature and humidity inched, rose smartly, and then shot into the insufferable range. Another thunderstorm, even bigger than the first, rolled through just as I made the hut. I waited it out along with Angry, amazed, again, at my incredibly good timing. A large group of Hebrew-speaking boys came in for the night and I retired to a campsite uphill from the shelter. Was joined by Ninja and another father/son. The night cooled off perfectly after the rain stopped, and out came the stars.","Bearfence Hut

The humidity was thick from all the rain the night before, but a breeze helped and I was only moderately sweat-drenched by the time I came upon Skyland Lodge. I cleaned up a bit and grabbed a table in the dining room--wow, what a view! The surrounding mountains shone gold under the still, early morning sunlight while clouds streamed past...and there was coffee. I hit the buffet line until I could barely walk and was half-tempted to see if any rooms were available--a nap would have been perfect.
Lots of sun and day hikers out on Stony Man and then several big groups having company retreats at The Pinnacles picnic area. Saw a bear near a road crossing. I met a guy at Byrd's Nest #3 who was carrying a huge backpack and unhappy about the park's camping restrictions. Mary's Rock turnoff brought back even more memories, but I didn't go up there this time. Good trail all the way to Pass Mtn. Hut.

The morning was cool and sunny and the trail was easy. Had a funny encounter with a hog near Beahms Gap when I got water from a spring. I never did see the thing, but it wasn't happy that I was down there. It made a lot of noise and chased me off before I got all of my water bottles filled. Some PATC folks were weed-whacking near Elk Wallow Gap, so I said hi then moseyed on up to the wayside. Cheeseburger and a beer--then a milkshake--a REAL, blackberry one this time!
There were super good views from a couple of overlooks I came across later in the afternoon, and  it was still early when I turned off onto the Gravel Springs side trail. I missed the tent sites beside the hut and ended up setting up on a flat spot a couple of hundred yards down a side trail. Saw another bear on way back to the shelter for dinner. Had dinner with Wildman, whom I'd been reading about in logbooks (a rabid skunk bit him and he was undergoing the shots, while still thru-hiking) and Bear Slayer, who'd accidentally startled a bear off a cliff.
A bunch of folks ended up there for the night, but I retired to my tent and enjoyed a quiet, last night in the Shenandoahs.","Pass Mountain Hut

Saw lots of bear scat and big, rolled-over rocks around Hogwallow Flat and then I noticed a bear paralleling my path. It finally lost interest and left, but in the midst of this ursine play land sat Ninja's tent, 50 yards off the trail. I wondered if he would have any bear stories to tell.This time I paid attention and did not miss the turnoff before Chester Gap like I did on my 2011 hike (twice would have been tough explaining). Tom Floyd Shelter was a great lunch spot and a chance to talk with thru-hiker Wolverine and PATC member Tom who was out doing trail maintenance. Tom had been in the whitehouse press corps during the Johnson administration. I heard but could not see a lot of kids having fun nearby, and later learned I had passed close to a nature center with a pool (and concessions stand), oh well. 
The highway came up quickly, and despite limited phone service, and being somewhat directionally challenged, I still managed to rendezvous with Corky--almost on time. She took me shopping and then to her house, halfway up a mountain on the outskirts of Front Royal. Unloading groceries, I saw a bear wander across her backyard! Her husband, Glen, whom I'd last seen in Maine, came home and we had a feast that ended with ice cream, apple pie and beers on their patio-deck overlooking a gorgeous, mountain-filled sunset. Corky and Glen put me up for the night, and I got to sleep in their sons' room (the boys were out hiking the PTC).","Gravel Springs Hut

Corky and I ate breakfast at a diner and then she dropped me at the ""Cabbin"" hostel. I ran into Wolverine and Sidequest there while I  sat out front and tried to shoe-goo my boots back together. The hostel owner, Lisa, drove in with Wildman. She had taken him to a clinic for another rabies shot. I got a tour of the old house she is renovating--that will be something once it is done. 
Then the section ridgerunner stopped by and I thought she looked familiar. We quizzed each other and darned if she wasn't another '11 thru-hiker, Tidewalker. We'd stayed in Overland Mountain Shelter together, with about 20 other hikers, on a stormy night when tornadoes raked the area around Roan Highlands. I did as much as I could for my boots and headed out. By that time it was super hot, but the trail turned easy once I gained the ridgetop. I stopped for a snack at the Mosby Campsite before coasting into Jim and Mollie Denton Shelter. The whole world seemed to be there--Sidequest, Wildman, Wolverine, Ninja and Angry plus a couple of families. 
A cut-throat game of horseshoes broke out, and my hoosier roots came through. One of the fathers and I SMOKED Ninja and Sidequest three games straight--ha!  Tidewalker and her supervisor came in for the night and my new 8-year-old pal, Tobin, helped me set up my tent.

double-check,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567424,"Okay, some history first to put this day into context. On my 2014 hike, I happened upon a woman with a pit bull at Ensign Cowall Shelter, in Maryland. The dog, a rescue pup from urban D.C. with the unfortunate name of ""Alfred"" was a mealtime beggar and had earned his own trailname: The Mooch. His red-haired and beaming human counterpart had brought him along for a trip over the C&O Canal and up the A.T. to Bear Mountain, New York. She had overcome an injury, gone through P.T. and was back out to finish the hike, so Rehab was her, fitting trailname. We became fast friends and moved up the trail, more or less together, often winding up at the same campsites. 
The little, pit bull turned out to be your typical hiker, but with four legs: he struggled against his backpack, just like me, on the rocky scramble out of Lehigh Gap, hated walking in the rain, loved pizza, and once, (to this day I believe it was deliberate) slipped a rock into my pack's side-pocket. I had so much fun hiking with these two that I was sad for days after we parted ways at Bear Mountain. Reaching my destination that year at the Canadian border, I also managed to lose my phone and all of my pictures and contact info from the entire hike. I had not heard from Rehab again until until this day. She just finished thru-hiking The Finger Lakes Trail and noticed my number in her hiking (flip) phone. I got a text.
Wildman passed me on the mowed hilltop just north of the shelter while I left message with my aunt and uncle that I was in the area (you do NOT pass by D.C. without checking in with Uncle Ray and Aunt Doris) and saw Rehab's reply. She was en route home, with Alfred, and wanted to meet up. Instead of choosing an easy place, like say where the trail crosses  I-66, I picked a crazy, out-in-the-middle-of-nowhere spot where I figured that I would be at the appointed time. I had to up my pace to make it, and I was still late. Overheated and sweaty, I stumbled into a small parking area and shouted ""Al-FRED,"" my standard greeting to the little pit whenever we would meet back up, and suddenly THERE he was, half-ignoring me and yet not barking--his standard greeting. Rehab, looking somehow younger after two years gone by, and thru-hiker-ft to boot, tugged at the other end of the leash. 
Led to the open tailgate of a minivan, I met Rehab's husband, Mat, who greeted me with a sandwich and fresh fruit. The parking area (I'd picked) was kind of an awful spot in the middle of this now very hot, sunny day, and Rehab & Mat kept pushing me into what little shade the van cast while we caught up and swapped trail stories. The FLT had been a solitary walk for Rehab and Alfred as they were two of the very few to ever thru-hike that trail. Still bright with the accomplishment, Rehab described the small towns they'd stopped in and the folks they'd met. Okay, Finger Lakes is now on my ever-growing to-do list. 
After too short a time together, we noticed that it was getting late in the day. For some reason I got very apprehensive about the hike down to the park, where I'd planned on staying the night,and my friends picked up on that. Maybe I was overtired or still fuzzy from the heat, but I was suddenly overcome by a sense of dread about getting back onto the trail. Mat and Rehab rearranged camping gear inside the van to fit me in and drove me to the park, which turned out to be a 30 mile trip by road. They stayed with me through a confusing check-in process (by this time my brain had turned to mush and I couldn't even focus on directions to the campsite the park staff gave me) until I was pointed the right way, on the right path. I said goodbye and hoisted my pack, now adorned with a peacock feather Rehab had stuck into a side pocket, and started off. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Rehab and Mat! Then something bumped my heel, and I turned to find Alfred, head half-turned away as if ignoring me, ready to hike. I cried the whole way to the campsite.","Jim and Mollie Denton Shelter

In my addled state the day before, I'd paid for a campsite instead of opting for the free one the park makes available to AT hikers. The upside was that I slept on a leveled, pea gravel tentpad. Throw a Neo-air on top of that and you're sleeping on a cloud. I packed up under a sunny sky and strolled down to the park entrance just as Uncle Ray drove up. Whatever dark cloud I'd put myself under suddenly evaporated--I was with family again! For the next day and a half, I was doted over and fed and generally made to feel loved. I counted up the times I've hit the House of Young on trail-related invasions, and I'm up to four. Thank you, once more, Uncle Ray and Aunt Doris.
So I drank my cousin's beer (thanks, Doug) played board games, and took naps.The news was exactly where I'd left it, one month earlier--a clown was still the center of attention.

He pressed a bag of junk food and fruit into my hands as I stepped out of the car. Phone in one hand and talking to my father (relaying that he was dropping his brother's son safely back onto the trail--I'm 60-plus now and can't begin to describe how touching that is) he waved goodbye, and I started out.* We had gotten ""lost"" along the way back, and instead of taking me to Sky Meadows, Uncle Ray had dropped me at Snickers Gap, thus skipping almost the entire length of the infamous Roller Coaster (oh, darn). I'm pretty sure he knew.
The afternoon was overcast but hot. I passed a group of teen-aged scouts heading in the same direction and made the Blackburn Center turnoff by late afternoon. Down the hill I went, hoping for food (the caretakers there have been known to feed hikers) and I was not disappointed. Trail Boss Chris and his wife, Shelley, brought out  dessert. A small group of us, a flip-flop thru-hiker, a young couple out for a few days, and myself, enjoyed ice cream and cookies on the picnic table overlooking a hazy view of the DC area. I set up on a tent pad and slept great. The scouts made it in just after dark and set up in hammocks.
*A note from today, just over one year from my visit with my aunt and uncle:  Uncle Ray died yesterday. His death was unexpected and tragic, but his life was all about family. Every memory of my aunt and uncle, for me, is a bright and joyous gathering of family celebrating each other. Many times I called from out of the blue when I was in the DC area, often from the trail, and always, Uncle Ray or Aunt Doris would want to know exactly where I was, because Ray was on the way to pick me up. I am nudged to  complete this hike's journal.","Uncle Ray and Aunt Doris's House
