Rooster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520805,"A week from today I will be in a hotel room near the start of the AT in GA. I am very excited to get started. Feb 14th is getting closer and closer. Everything is ready, my gear has been complete for sometime now. I am just waiting until that moment of leaving my house and heading to the trail.    If you happen upon my trail journal here and are unaware of my youtube channel, check it out.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjSEdkuE_8AXosJsISyyExQPeace",,View Entry,"Feb 06, Sat",0
Rooster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520852,"Well, the hotel is booked and now I wait. Waiting is the game. I have been making preparations for a while, and it seems all is ready. I have even established a YouTube channel(Rooster AT Hike) for the family, friends, and a few school classes to follow along. I'm excited and they are all excited. Now we wait. BUT, not too long! Today is the 8th, I start hiking the morning of the 14th! WOO!!!",,Hotel booked/ waiting game,"Feb 08, Mon",0
Rooster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521261,"Well, Feb 14th was amazing. Everything about it except watching my wife drive away at Springer Mountain was amazing. I made it to Hawk Mountain Shelter that night. Not many miles, but it was bitter cold. I think it got down to 17 degrees. Missing my wife Lori already was the first thing on my mind as I went to sleep.","

Rooster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521262,"Feb 15th was a very cold and wet day. The trees on the two mountains I hiked over were covered in ice and the wind was brutal. I took only a small number of pictures and video. The object was to make it to Gooch Mountain Shelter so pressing through the elements became a must. Stopping for more than a couple minutes became a seriously cold endeavor, so I kept my stops very short.","

Rooster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521443,Made it to Blue Mountain Shelter today. It was an easy hike. Getting some rest for the upcoming climbs tomorrow. Everything is going great so far. I have been staying in shelter so far to keep out of the wind as much as possible. I filmed a few great shots today and look forward to getting those in the next YouTube installment in a few days at Dicks Creek.,"

Rooster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521814,"While in our sleeping bags 4K, Rabbit, Leopard, Crash and myself heard snapping and then two gigantic trees crashed down on top of the shelter. Everyone is ok, but part of the shelter was completely smashed and the rest took significant structural damage. We are all very lucky to be alive!!     What a night!!! Thanks to Ron Haven in Franklin, NC for coming up the mountain and getting us in to town.","

Rooster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529396,"Today, on top of Brush Mountain, I was lucky enough to see the Audie Murphy Monument at mile 690.1 with a hiking friend of mine ""Backtrack."" Murphy was the most decorated American soldier of WW2 and had died in a plane crash near the site.    Backtrack and I both took some video and photos then he went on his way. I'm not sure how long I stayed, but it was well over 20 minutes for sure. I sat there on a bench long enough to remember why I was hiking the trail. Down the mountain I went again...","

Rooster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529397,"Monday was a warm day compared to previous days on the trail. With the sun shining down reminding me of the summer ahead I trudged onward. Soon, at mile 746.8 I came upon a wayside panel titled, ""Peaks of Otter."" These were the peaks that Earl Shaffer spoke of in his book. Shaffer was a WW2 veteran and the first person to thru hike the Appalachian Trail. Looking out at these peaks made me feel proud to make it this far. But, there is much more ground to cover so the stay was brief (20 plus mile day).","
