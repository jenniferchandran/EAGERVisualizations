Certificate,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480991,"Can it be that my dream of hiking the AT may actually become a reality? I can't believe it myself, but things are suddenly looking up. Don't get me wrong, there's a long way to go and I'm not there yet. There's still a lot of decisions, plans, and preparations that have to happen before IT happens. But at least there's hope now, and I'm willing to take that much and be happy. It's already been a long road to just get to this point - learning the ropes, gathering the equipment, finding a hiking partner, convincing the husband, etc, etc, But all that aside, I feel like I'm standing on the threshold of the rest of my life. The adventure looms ahead of me as big as Katahdin. First step - start my very own Trail Journal. Yes, that's right, I said MY TRAIL JOURNAL! Wow, am I actually going to post this and put it our there for everyone to see? Makes it kind of real. Are you sure you want to do that, Certificate? Are you going to stand by the statements you make? Aren't you afraid of getting yourself in a position where you'll embarrass yourself? Aren't you afraid of making the commitment to really doing this? YES, YES, YES, YES, and YES! But here I am, standing on that threshold, and I am going to take the first step into the adventure I have dreamed of for the last two years.",,Can It Be?,"Feb 04, Wed",0
Certificate,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481051,"I'm going to hike the AT. Decision made, simple as that. Lots of doubts, family and friends not exactly on board, too many obligations, too old, too lazy, etc. Lots of reasons why I shouldn't. But there's one reason why I should. I have the fever and can't get the stupid idea out of my head. There's only one cure. Hike the stupid trail! So I will try. I will indulge myself and be selfish for once.I will have the adventure of my life.*Thank you, God, for clearing the path.",,Stupid Idea,"Feb 05, Thu",0
Certificate,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481191,"I want to tell you about my two 'partners in crime'. The first is Sundance. I met her a little over a year ago through Trail Dames. Upon meeting, we felt an immediate kinship. I think the term 'soul sisters' is an appropriate description. She is full of sunshine, and that's what I wanted to call her. But then, one day as we hiked a trail on a cold, wintery day, I witnessed her dancing in the rays of the sun as they filtered down through the trees. And... ta da...SUNDANCE became her trail name. Together, we started a chapter of Trail Dames in SC. We have shared lots of laughs and good times. She and her husband, J2, let me tag along with them on their AT section hikes. It's great because, with them, I can truly HMOH (hike my own hike). They don't care if I hike ahead or behind. They are a great source of encouragement and support for me. The second is Shutter Bug. We only met a month ago. I can already tell we share the same AT dreams. She, too, wants to thru-hike but can't at this time due to work. She is 12 years younger, but our pace is similar. Lucky for me, she likes to stop and take pictures. Perfect! I can stop and catch my breath! For now, we plan to section hike as much of the AT as possible. We both hope the time will come when we can be on the trail for an extended period of time (semi thru-hike?). Both women are amazing! I am so lucky to have found them!*Thank you God for bringing Sundance and Shutter Bug into my life.",,Partners In Crime,"Feb 08, Sun",0

Certificate,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482169,"My husband had knee surgery a week ago and it has given me a chance to slow down while caring for him. That's been a good thing because it's also given me time to think about my plans to thru-hike the AT. Shutter Bug suggested I watch Loner's (2012) videos on You Tube. They are wonderful and he is amazing. He hiked the AT with a 22L pack that only weight about 15 lbs. That really has made me rethink the items I plan to take. I can definitely cut weight in the clothing area as long as I choose those items carefully. I keep reminding myself to select items that can serve more than one purpose. My next big decision is whether to tent or hang. They each have advantages and disadvantages. The hammock is more comfortable, but the tent offers more privacy. It may come down to which set up weighs less. I believe my only way to have a shot at the trail is too carry a pack with 25 pounds or less-including food and water. It'll take some sacrifice, but I know I can do it. I cannot carry a heavy pack. Once, when I was hiking with a 38 pound pack, I simply (and hysterically) fell to my knees right in the middle of the trail. As embarrassing as it was, it was a valuable lesson learned. *Thank you, Lord, for the experiences you have provided me with to prepare me for the trail.","Big Step

Certificate,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517035,"I know... I haven't posted in a very loooong time. That's because I go through periods of doubt that my hike will ever happen. And that really depresses me. My family does not support my dream. I thought they did, but I was mistaken. If I go, it will be against their wishes. So sad, don't you think? Why can't they be my biggest cheerleaders? Mainly, they fear for my safety. I have tried to educate them about the trail, but it hasn't changed their view. I know I should be happy and content with section hiking, but I'm not. IThey think I should be happy with section hiking, but I'm not. I am aware that section hiking makes more sense at my age (63), but it doesn't change my mind. I want to at least attempt a thru-hike. Even if that attempt is a total failure, I still want to try. I don't want to look back when I'm 80 and have this huge regret about not trying. I guess my dilemma is in the fact that I love my husband more than I love the trail. So why can't I put the subject to rest and forget about it?",,Discouragement,"Nov 07, Sat",0
Certificate,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517036,"Enough about 'discouragement',(my last Journal entry). I want to tell you about a fabulous experience I had this past June. I went on a sojourn hike with some women from Wild and White Blazing. We spent a week hiking in Virginia on the AT. It was both the hardest and most wonderful hike to date. We climbed Three Ridges and the Priest, hiking sobo. Considering the elevation profile, we did it the hardest way possible. LOL! It was hard, but I did it and survived to tell about it! Another achievement I accomplished was 6 consecutive nights on the trail. It wasn't all pretty. The next to the last day I broke down and cried from exhaustion. My body was d-o-n-e and needed rest. Even so, Icount it as a highly successful trip. I learned so much:1. I can successfully hike really hard parts of the trail. (Just keep putting one foot in front of the other.)2. I can enjoy the hike so much more if I go slow and practice being in the moment. (It's not a race.)3. I can carry a pack with six days of food and supplies. (It gets lighter as you go. Lol!)4. I can enjoy being with others as long as I get some alone time. (I tend to be an introvert. But aren't all hikers?)5. Other hikers are very supportive. (They know what you're going through.)6. I LOVE being out there!!!!7. I LOVE getting off the trail and getting a shower!8. You can form really strong bonds with the people you share AT experiences with.And that brings me to my sojourn companions, Carla, Trina, Jules, and Linda. They are amazing. Each one had a part in making my sojourn a true journey of the spirit. Thank you for your love and support! I will hold all the memories close to my heart forever.",,Three Ridges and The Priest,"Nov 07, Sat",0
Certificate,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517059,"In preparation for a future AT thru-hike, my friend (Shutter Bug) and I decided to do a section hike and equipment shake down from Springer Mountain to Neel Gap on April 1st of this year. It turned out be a great day to start our hike. We spent the night before at Hiker Hostel and rode their shuttle to Springer Mountain, along with about 14 other hikers. It was so exciting to be on a van full of thru-hikers, everyone chatting nervously about the adventure ahead. About 7 miles from our destination, an uncomfortable silence settled over the group. You could almost hear the thoughts going through their heads... What am I doing out here?... Have I lost my mind?... Will I make it?... When we pulled into the parking area, the ridge runner was there taking a survey for the ATC. He asked us our trail names and if we were section hikers or thru-hikers? Did we plan a straight NOBO hike or a flip-flop. Where were we from, etc... At that moment, I wanted so much to be a thru-hiker. I felt their excitement, and it felt like a a shot of pure adrenaline into my brain. The ridge runner offered to watch our packs as we hiked .9 miles up Springer to the starting point of the AT. Not being a purist, we jumped right on that opportunity. Forty minutes later we stood at the precipice of all our dreams and stared off into the distance. Touching the plaque was a surreal moment. I had imagined doing it for two years. Now, here I was in the actual place running my hand running over the cold metal. After pictures and signing the trail log, we headed back down to begin the journey. We were so excited even if we weren't beginning our thru- hike. The plan was to take it slow and enjoy the journey. It was a beautiful, sparkling day and there was definitely a hint of spring in the air. I was surprised that there were no leaves on the trees yet. Privacy with going to the bathroom was going to be a problem. We took our first break at Stover Creek Shelter and ate lunch. Shutter Bug scored a brand new hiking umbrella that another hiker was already tired of carrying. Mind you, this is only 2.8 miles into the journey. Okay... 4.6 if you add in the 1.8 up and down Springer! Lol! We hiked on for awhile and decided to set up camp early near a beautiful running creek. Time to relax. During the night, Shutter Bug thought she heard someone outside her tent, but when she called out they ran away. I must have slept like a baby because I didn't hear a thing. Hopefully, what she heard was one of the soldiers on maneuvers. We had heard they try to sneak up on hikers without being heard as part of a test. The next day it began to rain and it rained on and off for the next three days. It rained so hard we decided to get off the trail at Gooch Gap. The nights on the trail ended up being wild and crazy with downpours and thunder and lightening, not to mention the howling wind that sounded like banshees racing through the gaps. But all in all, I am thankful for that experience. It taught me to be prepared for anything and everything on the trail.",,Four Days in April,"Nov 08, Sun",0
Certificate,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517523,"God blessed me again with a three day escape to the Hiker Hostel and the AT. I met up with two friends at the hostel on Sunday. It was my third stay there and, as usual, a great experience. I highly recommend it as a starting point for your AT adventures. On Sunday night, we went to Dahlonega and had dinner at an Irish pub just off the square. The food was great and they played wonderful background music. The next day we ate breakfast at the hostel and had a chance to talk to a sobo hiker named Lux. He had just finished his thru-hike the day before. I always feel like I'm meeting a celebrity when I meet a thru-hiker. I asked him about the 100 Mile Wilderness. That's the portion of the trail I am most fascinated with. He said it was true wilderness and a tough trail because of roots everywhere. Two years ago I got to stand at the beginning of the 100 Mile Wilderness outside of Monson, ME. I walked in a few hundred yards and was hit by the smell of balsam. The forest smelled like Christmas. It made an indelible impression on my mind and I hope to smell it again one day as I begin my own journey into the 100 Mile Wilderness. After breakfast, our fourth hiking partner met us and we shuttled ourselves to Springer Mountain, leaving one car at Hightower Gap. The plan was to take it slow and easy, really enjoy the day. Sounds like a sojourn to me-be in the moment! (Takes me back to the WWB Sojourn this past summer. Thanks, Carla!) It was a beautiful day to hike, cloudy and cool, with the sun breaking through every so often. We lunched at Stover Creek Shelter then hiked a little further to a great camping spot beside the creek. We set up camp and then enjoyed dinner and a warm campfire complete with yoga stretching. It couldn't have been more perfect.The next day we planned only to hike to Hawk Mountain Shelter, but with the weather prediction of intense rain, we decided to get off the trail. And that was okay with me. I had gotten my AT fix for awhile and was happy. One lesson the trail has taught me is to always be flexible. Hiking plans cannot be carved in stone. Learn to go with the flow.",,Hightower Gap,"Nov 18, Wed",0
