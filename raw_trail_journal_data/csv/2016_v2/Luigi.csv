Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523248,"It's about 3.5 months until my thru-hike and 2 weeks until I leave my job. The reality is definitely starting to set in. I'm mostly excited but a little nervous, mostly about the unknown. What will the hike be like? Who will I meet? Will I get bored from doing the same activity day after day? Although we have multiple options for activities in our ""normal"" lives, it seems that hiking from location to location, seeing different views, and meeting a variety of people will be variety enough. I know there will be challenging days but I'm looking forward to it and I think I'm just stubborn enough to push through the bad days.So far I have read Skywalker, AWOL, and Appalachian Trials and I just started reading Lost on the Appalachian Trail. My reading is to mentally prepare me for the hike and give motivation. Of the books I've read, Skywalker was my favorite but they've all had different, interesting viewpoints.Late February me and Ashley hiked a section of The Florida Trail and camped overnight so I could practice with me gear. The thing I had the biggest problem with was relaxing enough to use my Pibella (female urinary device!) because my body is trained to sit when I pee. It took about 3 or 4 tries! I just need to practice more at home in case I miss and have an ""accident"". The successes of the overnight trip were figuring out the best way to use my water filter, hanging my bear bag (only 3 tries to get the rope over the limb!), and cooking a Mountain House meal by boiling water with my new stove. We are also excellent fire makers! I used my new Enlightened Equipment down quilt for the first time and it kept me cozy warm in the cool temperatures, minimal draft. Ashley said she was only cold from the knees down in her bag and decided that next time she'll wear some tall, warm socks. Overall it was a fun, educational weekend and I was really happy Ashley was able to join me! I feel much more prepared for the hike.",,View Entry,"Mar 11, Fri",0
Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526200,"So, I typed a great blog entry and it got deleted before I could post it. Now, I'm going to summarize the entry because it's late and I should go to bed soon.I finished packing my gear and supplies for my trip today and I leave for Atlanta in the morning. I was definitely feeling stressed trying to get everything in order for the hike as well as pack some things for my storage unit. I got together four mail-drops, mostly to obtain my trail guide but I put some other random things in there as well. Important things, like Snickers and Reese's Cups.My final base weight is about 18.8 lbs. I was hoping it was going to be lighter than that but I'm sure it will be after the cold weather passes and I exchange some of my cold weather gear for shorts and T-shirts. There's a big storm going through the mountains right now and I'm very glad that I decided to wait until April to start the hike. I definitely know I over packed in the food department. I figure it's better to start out with more food until I establish a steady hiking pace. I don't function well when I'm hangry. I'm definitely getting nervous and slightly scared but I think it's important to do things that scare us. If we run from our fears we would never do anything. I will definitely miss my friends, family, Leo (my cat), common luxuries, water from the faucet, toilets, umm...I'm sure I'm missing some things. I think my adventure will be worth it though. Tomorrow I will meet my nephew, born on April 1st, and I'll have several days to visit him, my sister, and my brother-in-law before leaving for my hike. It's sad that I have to leave so soon but I'll stop by to visit longer after the hike. Thank you to everyone for the love and support you've shown me as I've been planning for this trip. I intend to make it to Maine!",,Leaving for Atlanta,"Apr 03, Sun",0
Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527431,"The days have been going by so quickly and it's really easy to lose track of time. I'm currently at Neels Gap taking a zero day because it's been raining most of the morning and that just didn't sound fun to walk in while it's cold outside. My first day out I hiked up the Approach Trail. My starting pack weight at Amicalola was 30 lbs with food and water, which I think is pretty good. The Approach Trail starts with a steep incline followed by about 600 stairs, then you begin the 7.5 mile hike up to Springer. I could feel my legs getting tired as I approached the summit of Springer Mountain; mostly when I would lift my legs since I'm so adjusted to the flat land of Florida. Courtney joined me on Springer later in the evening and we chatted with other thru-hikers by the camp fire. I've seen a couple of them since then but many have hiked further than me (or dropped out, it's difficult to determine).Overall, the hiking over the last 4 or 5 days has been really nice. Courtney joined me for hiking on my second day but had to head back to her car on the third. The first couple days my shoulders and hips felt bruised from the pack but that has slowly stopped, I hardly notice it anymore. My legs are also adjusting to the climbs and my trekking poles have become an extension of my body. I hardly think about moving them, they just work with the walking motion I'm doing. So far my favorite climb then scenery was up Blood Mountain where there was a stone shelter at the top and great views from the mountain. Camping so far has been fun, yet challenging. Most nights have been really cold and my down quilt will get drafty when I roll over. I'm getting pretty good at rolling over and shifting the bag at the same time but it does wake you up. Also, since sites have been crowded we end up sharing tent pads and the ground isn't totally flat so you end up sliding down your tent throughout the night. It's an interesting experience but totally worth it. I've been averaging about 11 to 12 hours of sleep at night and take my time getting ready in the mornings. I'm usually one of the last to leave. I love not having a set schedule. How often do we get to do that in our ""normal"" lives? I suspect I'll get up earlier when the temperatures get warmer. So far the mornings have consisted of biting cold, strong winds, or rain.I've met some great people on the trail so far. There are 2 women who I've been spending the most time with (both are also late risers in the morning). Their trail names are Tranquility and Right Lane. There's also a group of about 10 people I see regularly in the evenings. My trail name is Luigi due to my homemade Super Mario trash cover and all my green-colored gear. I'm happy to be taking the day off with Tranquility and Right Lane today to rest and insure successful hiking in the upcoming days, even if it means losing a lot of our main group. I'm sure I'll see people down the road eventually. Also the cabins I'm in have pizza. I ate about half a pizza yesterday in 5 minutes. It was delicious. In summary, I'm happy to be out here and loving it. I'm blister-free and feeling great!On the left hand column of the journal page there is a guest book you can sign and pictures I've posted.","Amicalola Falls State Park

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528282,"I am now in Hiawassee. We left the cabins on the 12th and intended to hike 12 miles to Low Gap Shelter but we left too late and decided to only hike to a shelter 8 miles away. At my lunch break another hiker pointed out that the shelter we were hiking to was 1.2 miles off the trail. I know hiking 1.2 miles doesn't seem like much with everything we're hiking, but when you're out here you definitely don't want to hike more than you have to. Right-Lane caught up to me at lunch and I told her we should bypass that and either make it to Low Gap or stealth camp. We texted Tranquility but she didn't get the message until it was too late and she went to the shelter off the trail.When I approached Hogpen Gap I saw other hikers and a biker. He was doing trail magic and handing out drinks. Right-Lane caught up to me and we decided to stay where the group of hikers were staying, at a site near the gap. One of the guys in the group runs a company that sews outdoor gear so I got his business card in case that's something I may be interested in doing in the future. You never know and I think sewing outdoor gear could be really fun. The other days of hiking were pretty uneventful. Right-Lane's feet were hurting so we lost her (she traded her boots for trail-runner shoes in the next town). When I reached Unicoi Gap I saw a lot of people standing around and many hikers.  You always can assume it's trail magic when you see this but I'm never totally sure and don't want to just jump into their group. It turns it there were 2 groups doing trail magic! One was grilling hotdogs and hamburgers and the other bacon and sausage. I put some bacon on my burger. It was awesome! They also had random items we could take with us. I got some peanut butter crackers (a lunch staple for me), oreos, toothpaste,  and Rice Krispies Treats.On the 14th I decided I would try to make pasta sides in my pot. Bad idea. So far I've been just boiling water in my pot and cooking in freezer bags or Mountain House bags. The water kept boiling over, noodles burned to the bottom of the pot, and when it was almost over I knocked it onto the ground and lost half my noodles to the dirt. I scooped them up per ""leave no trace"" rules, but it's unfortunate to have to pack them out (no I didn't eat them). Washing out my dishes in the small trickling stream was a pain as well. I just won't be doing that again. Yesterday Tranquility and I woke up early and hiked to Dick's Creek Gap where we hitched into town with a guy who does a lot of hiking in this area. Areas where the trail passes always have people willing to give rides to hikers. We felt so dumb though standing by the road looking for a ride. Hiawassee has been great so far. We went to a buffet and I ate enough for about 3 people. Tonight I'm staying at the Top of Georgia Hostel, which will be my first hostel. I'm meeting Little Foot there so I'm sure it will be fun. She said the place is nice, and they have pizza. Currently I'm waiting for my laundry to finish (I'm wearing my rain gear while it washes) then I'm going to get some Starbucks, resupply, and relax and wait for the shuttle up to the hostel.","Neel Gap

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529547,"My stay at Top of Georgia Hostel was amazing. The place is clean, the workers are friendly, and the entire place is very relaxed. They have a lounge area with free coffee and cocoa, movies, and couches. In the evening the proprietor, Sir ""Packs-A-Lot"", gives a speech about thru-hiking. He's a great speaker and very enthusiastic about our journey and thru-hiking in general. He gave us tips about getting through the Smokey Mountains and succeeding in thru-hiking. Apparently by this point, 25% of people have already left the trail. By the end of the Smokey Mountains, 35% will have quit.My stay in Franklin was nice, but hectic. We arrived late in the day on August 19 and did laundry before going out. Unfortunately though, by the time laundry finished, it was late and everything was closed so we couldn't get a ride into town. Luckily, there was a Taco Bell nearby which was closed at the interior but the drive through was open! Obviously we didn't have a car so we walked down the drive through, couldn't activate the pressure plate to order, and decided to walk up to the drive through window and see if they would serve us. After our sob story of walking 13 miles and everything being closed, the worker was very friendly and allowed us to order.I stayed in Franklin for an extra day in the main part of town with my main group. We resupplied at Walmart and I bought extra to send a mail drop to Fontana Dam (the stop before the a Smokey Mountains) and Standing Bear Farm (the stop right after the Smokey Mountains). I sent off the mail the following morning so it should arrive on time.After staying in Franklin, I decided I needed to leave my group and continue on by myself to do my own thing for a while. I like the solitude and I know a lot of people around that main group, so I'm not totally alone. I was informed the morning I was going to leave that there were forest fires in the area and my upcoming section of trail was closed. I called my dad to see if he could figure out what was going on and he was able to determine that they got the fire under control near the trail and reopened that section. My group decided to stay an extra day at the hotel anyways, so I pressed on.On April 22nd it rained all day. I hid in my tent until about 1:30 then decided maybe I should just brave the rain. My tent was extremely muddy and water logged but this won't be the last rain day, so I better get used to it. I hiked to the next shelter where I met The Real Hiking Viking who started his day at the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) but stopped at the shelter to wait out the rain. He's a hiking legend. He's hiked the 3 major long trails and was doing the Appalachian Trail again, but south-bound. He also started in the winter in the snow and ice. I remember reading his story and seeing his picture before I started my hike. He's basically averaging 40-mile days and will be done with the trail in 3-4 days (it's taken me 2 weeks to get to this point!). It was an awesome experience and we were all pretty excited to meet him. He gave us a group photo, which is what I used for this journal entry.I'm definitely getting stronger in my hiking, or ""getting my trail legs"" as they say. I've started to increase my mileage lately. My furthest hiking day was today where I hiked 16.5 miles to get to the NOC. I had a big burger with a side if spinach (I would never usually eat that, but it was great). Tomorrow I'll eat some breakfast pancakes then hit the trail. It's a really step incline out of the NOC.","Hiawassee, GA

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530026,"The morning I left the NOC I ate at the Rivers End restaurant and got my pancakes, which I've been craving. The pancakes were blueberry, not chocolate chip, but they were still very delicious. We met a group of ladies who were very fascinated by us thru-hiking and insisted on getting a group picture of us (the current group I'm with). Storm and I put our feet in the water of the river, just to say we had, but it but it was really cold so I didn't keep my feet in very long.The hike out of the NOC wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be. There was a lot of uphill walking but I think since I expected it to be terrible, it ended up being alright.In the evening, was telling one of the ladies in my group (who I trail named Fiesta due to all her bright, fun clothes) about my pibella female urination device. She decided she had to have one and it will change her hike. Guys don't understand the struggle of having to travel deep into the forest just to pee. I recommend all women have a urination device, especially if they're going into the woods for extended periods of time. The company that makes them is from Switzerland, so she ordered one to her mom's house in England, then will have it forwarded to the US, and hopes it will come in soon.My second day of hiking was uneventful, but Storm and I hiked 15 miles. We wanted to get closer to Fontana Dam so we could have more time in town. The following morning we hiked 6 miles to the Fontana Hilton Shelter. It's the nicest shelter we've come across. The shelter has hot showers, bathrooms with flushing toilets, sinks with soap, and tent pads so the tents are flat. Not many camping things are worse than rolling downhill while you're sleeping, which I've done many times. At the fancy shelter we set up our tents, took showers, then took a shuttle into town. I started laundry then wandered around town trying to find the lodge to get my mail drop. Ultimately, the resupply here would have been fine but I didn't want to risk it and not have enough food for the Smokey's.The main restaurant in town was closed so I ate hot dogs and nachos at the gas station, with the group, then we headed back to camp to relax and prepare for the days ahead. I'm nervous about the rules of the Smokey Mountains, such as the rule that you have to stay in the shelters (verses my tent). I'm hoping that I can get through the Smokey's in 5 days but the terrain is supposed to be challenging. A lot of people are stopping in Gatlinburg for a resupply but I've been there so I just want to get through that section of trail with hopefully limited rain and great views.Ultimately, I'm excited to cross Fontana Dam in the morning.Note: For those new to the blog, there are photos and a guest book you can sign in the left margin.","Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC)
",Fontana Dam,"Apr 26, Tue",6.70
Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530712,"My pack into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was loaded with about 6 days worth of food to get me through the Smoky's without having to stop in town (that didn't quite work out how I planned but I'll go into that later). My pack was extremely heavy for tackling the extremes of the Smoky's. I ended up eating some lunch before the big assent just so my pack would be lighter. There's a steady and steep, mostly uphill climb, to the first shelter in the Smoky's...which is located 10 miles in. It was my most difficult day so far. I felt lethargic most of the day and the miles really were dragging on (I attribute this to the uphills and heavy food bag). I took a break 2 miles before the shelter to get water, eat my emergency GU energy packet, and lay on the ground. It got me up the last hill.The rules in the Smoky's dictate that section hikers stay in the shelters (typically shelters are 3-sided structures with raised floors) first, then thru-hikers are required to fill in all available spaces before any are allowed to tent camp. Personally, I prefer the privacy of my tent but I followed the rules and stayed in the shelter (even though a lot of hikers didn't, all my group did). I mostly worry that the mice, which live in the shelters, will crawl on me when I'm sleeping. I had many dreams about mice crawling on me that evening but luckily I didn't experience this, probably. This is unrelated, but I did manage to get too close to my cooking stove at this shelter and I burned a hole in the bottom of my pants. I didn't burn my skin though, so it's okay.My remaining days in the Smoky Mountains have been pretty good. I decided they're more difficult because there are less switch-backs to gradually assend you up the mountain, instead the trail just leads straight up, which makes the climbing steep.You can really see spring blooming in the mountains right now, especially at lower elevations. There are many flowers lining the trail and we've started to see some wildlife such as deer and turkeys. I haven't seen a bear yet but I'm hoping to. I talked with another hiker who saw one on his first day in the Smoky's. He said the bear was sitting on the trail eating berries.When we passed Clingman's Dome (the official highest point on the trail and somewhere near the 200-mile mark), us thru-hikers were very interesting to the tourists. People were staring at us and taking pictures. Some would talk to us about what we were doing and some had never heard of thru-hiking. Here is an example of some unknowing tourist conversation:Tourist: How many miles have you walked?Hiker: Today? Or total?Tourist: What do you mean? Hiker: Well, we hiked 10 miles today but started 3 weeks ago in GA and have walked about 200 miles. Tourist: !!! Wow! How far are you going?!Hiker: Today? Or total? We're going to Maine, it's 2000 miles away. Tourist: What?! Wow!It was fun to see all the views from Clingman's Dome of where we've been and where we're going. Also, a ranger was giving thru-hikers Oreo cookies, which is currently my favorite and really made my day.I decided a couple days into the Smoky's that I did want to go into Gatlinburg to get pancakes, even though I have enough trail food. I got a ride to town after some delicious trail magic. (Note: To clarify, this isn't people doing magic by the trail. It's strangers performing random acts of kindness, usually involving giving us hikers food but sometimes it's as simple as taking our trash or giving us a ride into town.) We were given sodas and snacks by one group and just before we left we were given Krispy Kreme donuts by another guy. Sarah (now named Scavenger) of The Royal Couple said ""it's weird how things are hiking. I don't know how if it's the hunger, but someone gives you donuts and you eat them. In normal life if some stranger gave you donuts you'd be like 'what's wrong with you, you weirdo?!'"" It is surreal.Once we arrived into Gatlinburg, Storm and I did laundry, took cold (free) showers at the NOC Outfitters, then proceeded to go eat those pancakes I've been wanting and...they closed 20 minutes prior to us arriving. It was crushing so I decided we had to stay in town and eat pancakes tomorrow. Everything ended up working out since there are also thunderstorms in the area and that's not particularly fun to hike or tent in, although I know I'll have go eventually. We ate dinner with The Royal Couple and the evening turned out to be pleasant. So, here I am now in the town I wasn't planning to stop in with 2 days of hiking left in the Smoky Mountains.Note: At the top of this page I'm attempting to keep my total milage hiked updated for assistance with tracking my approximate location and how far I've traveled.","Fontana Dam
","Gatlinburg, TN","Apr 30, Sat",4.30
Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531743,"I got my pancakes in Gatlinburg. Storm, the Royal Couple, and I ate at the Pancake Pantry and the pancakes (and bacon and coffee) were delicious. It was worth the wait. Storm and I hitched a ride back to the trail with a hiker who lives in Gatlinburg and works with his family. Simon of the Royal Couple was staying an extra day to see Scavenger off to the airport. He said he planned on hiking longer milage days while she was gone and he wasn't kidding! He caught me about 2-3 days later!Storm and I got back to the trail somewhat late so I didn't plan on an excessively long hiking day (about 10 miles). The hike involved a lot of uphill climbing but I came across several beautiful scenery locations. I set my pack down, since my back had been hurting me, and hiked to a rocky overlook when a ridge-runner came along and told me I couldn't leave my pack unattended. Apparently there has been a bear in that area who has been stalking hikers trying to get food. I thought this meant I would get to see a bear at some point (hopefully not stalking me) but I still haven't seen one. After the ridge-runner left, a German fellow who I've seen a few times suggested that my food bag should be shifted down in my pack based on the location of my back pain. I did this and it worked! It was such a simple solution but I haven't had issues since then.I slept in two more shelters before the end of the Smoky's. At one I went to bed early but heard some late arrivers commenting on how many mice were trying to get their food (I still didn't experience any crawling on me). The During following day I hiked about 20 miles, my longest day yet, to Davenport Gap Shelter. This shelter is the last of the Smoky Mountain shelters which has the bear cage across the front. All the shelters used to have them but people got too brave and were feeding bears from the ""safety"" of the cages. This really just encouraged bears to harass hikers, so all but this cage have been removed. I arrived at the shelter just before a thunderstorm hit and I took my usual spot in the shelter at the upper level, second from the right, but it didn't work out as well for me this time because there was a roof leak at that location. Luckily everyone was understanding and we all shifted to the left to avoid the leak.After leaving the Smoky's, which required walking through multiple streams due to the rain, the trail continued along a short stretch of road. It's the first time I've experienced hiking the trail on any length of road where we weren't just crossing a street. It makes sense though that the trail can't totally avoid major rivers or interstates (I hiked under I-40). Upon reentering the woods, there was a random mailbox along the trail with trail-magic inside! There were creme-filled oatmeal cookies and they were awesome! It's always great to find something like that along the way.Shortly after the trail magic encounter, I arrived at the Standing Bear Farm hostel where I was able to retrieve my mail drop and charge my devices. As usual, I had packed too much food and my bag was really heavy. I resisted the urge to shower and do laundry because this would be an extra $10 and Hot Springs was only 2 or 3 days away. I also decided not to stay at the hostel since I hadn't hiked for long and needed to accomplish more miles, even if it was raining off and on throughout the day. At camp I met a guy named Haiku who was collecting poems from people. I told him I could provide him with a haiku about pancakes. I wrote the following haiku:Delicious PancakesChocolate Chip HappinessI Want Them DailyNot my best poetry work but it came from the heart.My next day of hiking somewhat dragged on but I reached a grassy bald called Max Patch. It was a panoramic view and beautiful. It was also windy so there were families up there flying kites. I hiked on from there and decided to try and make it to a campsite past the shelter when I started feeling some rain drops and seeing rain clouds. I was at a gap with some unofficial camp spots and decided I'd just set up there so I could avoid the rain. I had enough time to set up and eat before it started raining. My first stealth camping experience went well but it was cold and rainy. People at the top of the mountain said they experienced hail in the morning hours but it only rained on me.The hike into Hot Springs felt like it lasted forever! I usually feel this when anticipating food, showers, and clean clothes. During my first big climb of the day I saw some white stuff falling but I assumed it was pedals from the white flowers I've seen around, then I looked up and realized it was snowing! It was only snowing a little but it was really exciting to experience considering it's the beginning of May. I'm ultimately hoping it will warm up soon.","Gatlinburg, TN

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532775,"My stay in Hot Springs was very pleasant. I decided to get a massage, which happened to be on my one-month trail anniversary (May 6th). It was worth it. Hot Springs is the first town we've visited where the trail goes through the main street of town.I stayed at both the hostels in town since I was taking a zero (zero=not hiking any miles on the trail). It's interesting to me that even when we take zeros, we still walk around a lot. Even in a small town it can take quite a bit of walking to get anywhere. None of us have cars after all. At least we don't have to carry our packs around town (usually), which makes it somewhat restful.The first hostel I visited, Hostel at Laughing Heart, was pleasant but typical. There were bunks, showers, and a kitchen for people to use. The second hostel, Elmers Sunnybank Inn; however, was very unique. It was a Victorian style house which has been around since 1875 and the owner has been there for about three decades. Each person staying gets an individual room. My room was at the corner of the house and there was a bathroom between my room and the hallway. Due to this, the hostel manager encouraged guests not to use that one as it would trap me in my room.This owner of Elmers Sunnybank Inn had an impressive library with books on politics, free thought, and philosophy. I didn't get to read any as I didn't have time but I wrote down a couple of titles to read in the future. I signed up for the hostel breakfast the following morning which I was told was a homemade vegetarian meal. I was sceptical at first but heard good things about it. It was amazing! We had waffles, fruit, fresh apple juice, and homemade granola that you could eat as cereal with milk. It's one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. The owner also asked philosophical questions to get people discussing topics other than the trail. It made for great and interesting conversation. Our original question was ""if you could live anywhere and at any time, when would you live and why?"" He let the conversation and debate pursue and would occasionally redirect the topics.The hike out of Hot Springs was through a recently burnt forest. The fire took a while to put out and a 14-mile section of the trail was closed because of it. The fire was extinguished and the trail was cleared, maybe a week or two before I arrived in Hot Springs. It was surreal to hike through such an extensive burn. Trees were scorched and fallen and there was ash everywhere. From what I heard, it was a disgruntled hiker who intentionally set the fire, but I haven't confirmed this information yet.My hiking over the last couple of days have been uneventful. I've seen Little Grizz consistently at my last couple of sites and have stayed with other hikers off and on. I stopped by a new hostel called Hiker Paradise, which is about halfway between Hot Springs, NC and Erwin, TN. I mostly stopped to get something tasty to eat. I didn't stay at the hostel, even though it was nice. The owner says he loves running one but it took a couple of years to get set up. He said it's like Disney World, where he's the ride attendant and we're the happy people stopping by.One thing I did realize on the trail recently is that a lot of trail magic is geared towards morning hikers. There were two times over the last couple of days where I missed trail magic because they had left before I got there. Not only do I leave slightly later than some hikers, I take my time to enjoy the walk and see the sites. It's strange to me, but some people walk as fast as possible to get to camp. There are so many things to see along the way! I choose to enjoy them. Sometimes trail magic is in the form of a cooler with drinks or fruit by the side of the trail, that's always gone by the time I arrive. It wasn't all disappointing though, I was at the right place at the right time on one day and two different day hikers gave me an orange (at different times). Fresh fruit is a luxury out here and always appreciated. Those day-hikers made my day and hiking was a breeze after that treat.My final day of hiking into Erwin started with a major thunderstorm in the morning. Taking my own advice from the last major storm, I packed up all my gear in the rain and hiked. It's actually quite pleasant to hike in the rain once you get going. The rain didn't continue all day and I arrived in Erwin around 6pm. I hitched into town with Matt and Mark and we'll figure out how to get to Trail Days at Damascus in the morning. I'm excited for it! Hopefully we have no issues getting there.","Hot Springs, NC

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533932,"Trail Days, an annual celebration of past and current thru-hikers, was held May 12-15 in Damascus, VA. I'll be hiking into Damascus next week; however, since I'm not quite there I hitchhiked with Rambler and Stumbler to get there. It took four rides to successfully make the journey. Our first ride consisted of an older gentleman taking us from Walgreens to slightly further down the road. Our second ride was from a thru-hiker and his girlfriend, who drove us down the highway to a road that heads in the direction of Damascus. They were planning on attending Trail Days but weren't going until the following day. Our third ride was from a guy who owns a coffee shop in Elizabethton called The Coffee Company. He stopped by the shop and gave us all free coffee drinks of our choice, then drove us further down the road. We each got a thin mint frappe. The coffee shop was amazing! All the employees were extremely friendly and enthusiastic about our journey. Our fourth and final ride was with a couple who were headed to Trail Days. The car was packed and we could barely see over our backpacks. That final drive into Damascus was a winding mountain road and without being able to see much I was definitely feeling some motion sickness which continued into the evening...or so I thought.I went to bed that evening feeling less than perfect but I still attributed that to the car ride...until about 12:30am when I woke up feeling extremely nauseated. I'm not going to go into all the details of it, but basically I couldn't eat or drink anything and keep it down. This persisted through the night, which included being stuck getting sick in my tent during a thunderstorm, which wasn't fun. I told a fellow hiker of my predicament when it started so someone was aware of my situation and could check on me occasionally.In the morning, I asked Storm to see if he could find a clinic in town that I could visit. There was a group from Harvest Ministries who had set up a clinic consisting of nurses. They took my pulse and blood pressure and said my pulse was at 108 bpm, indicating I was extremely dehydrated. They told me to try and drink fluids and to check back at noon to see if I was doing better. If not, they wanted to take me to the urgent care in the adjacent city for IV fluids. It was a long 3 hours. I was only moderately successful at keeping fluids down. My friends were very kind and would bring me water and Gatorade, or just sit with me. I would warn other hikers of my situation if they sat down at my table and some (not my friends) would run away, literally. People are scared of the Norovirus, which is what I'm fairly certain I had since I've recently heard of other hikers getting sick with something similar. I can't say I blame them. It was awful and I'd probably run from it too.When I went back to the clinic my pulse had lowered so they didn't think I needed additional care, just to wait it out. The people hosting the clinic let me sleep on the couch and ultimately stay past clinic hours so I could rest. There were tons of teenagers running around and yelling in that building but at least I had a couch and people to check on me. They went above and beyond. They ended up offering to let me stay with a father and son from their group who had a cabin away from tent city (the main field and woods of tents at Trail Days where people stay up ALL night partying and yelling) so I could get some sleep. Even though I slept all day, I slept through the night and was happy the nausea had passed. I only ate a piece of bread and a few crackers that day so I was definitely weak.The following morning the father and son took me to a relative's house and she made us toast with homemade applebutter, eggs, and sausage. It was a little heavy for having just been sick but it was great since I hadn't eaten for almost a day. Afterwards they drove me back to Trail Days, I thanked them again, and we parted ways. I'm very grateful these people were generous enough to take care of me and let me stay with them.The remainder of Trail Days was fun but I was still recovering. I hiked in the hiker parade where hikers and spectators have water guns and try to soak eachother. I wore my rain suit. It was really fun though and there were way more people than I was expecting. Afterwards, I walked around the backpacking festival and put my name in a few drawings. I ended up winning a free stay at a hostel in Connecticut. I also hear my name was called for another drawing but it was across town and I wasn't feeling up for the walk since you have to be present to win. Although I felt a lot better, I was still really tired Saturday and Sunday and my stomach was slightly crampy from everything. I sat at the main festival, watched the hiker talent show, and caught up with Right-Lane (my hiking partner from the beginning of my journey) and her friend later in the day. I was really happy to see her again. She's one town behind me and I hope to see her again during the hike. I was occasionally able to see Tranquility (also a former hiking partner), but not often due to my illness. She says she's going to try and catch me.On Sunday morning Right-Lane and her friend offered to drive me back to Erwin on their way to Hot Springs and I was extremely grateful for that. We ate dinner at a local diner before we left but I wasn't able to eat a big breakfast. It took a few days for my appetite to go back to normal. The drive back to Erwin was much less hectic than the drive to Trail Days! I was sad to part ways with Right Lane again though.","Erwin, TN

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534258,"I spent one more night at Uncle Johnny's Hostel after getting back from Trail Days, then hiked out the following morning (Monday). It took a couple of days but I was finally back to feeling normal after getting sick.The hiking the first few days were mild. There was some rain but nothing crazy. After the second night of camping, Little Grizz and I made chocolate chip pancakes in the morning and offered a few to other hikers. They loved us. Little Grizz hiked out the batter, butter, and chocolate chips. To make the pancakes we used a fuel canister stove and Little Grizz's skillet. We mixed the batter in a bag and cut off the corner so we could squeeze the batter onto the skillet. While the pancake was cooking we had to occasionally shift the skillet around on the flame so it would cook evenly. To flip them we had a fork and I would put the edge under the pancake and quickly turn it over (quite successfully I might add). Overall they turned out amazing! Way better than either of us was expecting. We only made half the batter and intended to make more at a later shelter but all the other mornings were windy and that would just make it too difficult.The last two days of hiking have been nothing but fog. I hear the sections we went over, such as Roan Mountain (which hosts the highest shelter on the AT), are some of the most picturesque locations on the trail. I wouldn't know. Over the last two days I could see about 40 feet in front of me at best. It made for some eerie hiking and occasionally I had to look around for the white blaze if the trail reached an intersection with a random side trail or we were at the top of a bald and there appeared to be multiple trail options. The fog also prevented any of my gear from drying, which it desperately needed.The day before I reached US-19 I stayed at Overmountain Shelter which is a barn that has been converted into a shelter. I decided that my stuff would get even more wet if I slept in my tent so I stayed in the shelter. This is the first shelter on the trip that I slept in by choice, it was required in the Smoky Mountains. I did see a mouse running around but luckily not near me. I didn't sleep well that night. Even though the fog was mostly not in the barn, it has quite a few openings between the boards and the wind got really strong during the night. It was cold and humid.Speaking of the wind, it continued well into the day. There was a considerable amount of the day where I was on the top of a mountain at a bald and the wind was blowing at about 60 mph. It was a long section of trail and my pack became a wind catcher due to the conditions. Sometimes when things like that happen you just have to laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation. With all the mist in the air I did have my biggest fall while hiking today. I was walking down some rocks when my feet started to slide. I couldn't remain upright so I used my trekking poles to break my fall and I did a less than graceful slide, fall, and roll maneuver. I only ended up with some scraps and a cut on my hand, so it could have been much worse. Yay for trekking poles!When I reached US-19 I walked to the hostel down the street but all the bunk spots were full and the washing machine was broken. Little Grizz decided he would tent camp at the hostel but I didn't want to do that so I contacted Rambler about staying with him in Elizabethton. I rode there with some section hikers who were just finishing. Rambler and I were able to do our laundry, resupply, and eat a filling dinner. I'm pretty excited about sleeping in a bed too.
My plan in the upcoming days is to hike 15-20 mile days so I can get into Damascus for my birthday. 30 years old! Damascus is about 70-80 miles away.","Erwin, TN

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535243,"I did many high mileage days to reach Damascus by my birthday and I succeeded. It took about 4.5 days for me to travel about 75ish miles.When Rambler and I left Elizabethton it took a lot longer than we were expecting to get a ride back to the trail. We resupplied at a Big Lots (which actually has a great selection of hiker foods) and it took about 2 hours and 2 rides to get back to the trail. I didn't start hiking until noon and was aiming for 17 miles. I didn't hike particularly fast during the day and as it went on I realized I'd never reached my goal by dark. I ran back into Rambler later in the day (he skipped a side trail to a beautiful waterfall) and he suggested that we could night hike to make the 17 mile goal. I hadn't night hiked before but I've been wanting to try it so that's what we did. It's really eerie once the sun sets and you can't see anything around you except what your headlamp hits. We were singing songs and hitting our trekking poles together as we walked. As much as I want to see a bear, I didn't want to see one right in front of me in the dark. Despite our singing, at one point we were trying to avoid falling in the mud and we looked up to see eyes reflecting in the darkness. We didn't know if it was a bear or not but quickly discovered it was a deer and scared it from our path. We ended up getting to camp around 11pm, which is about 2 hours past hiker midnight.I got up earlier and hiked further than Rambler the following day and I didn't see him again until town. I hiked between 15 to 17 miles each day to reach Damascus in time for my birthday. Although I was hiking long distances, I still took the time to enjoy the journey. There were waterfalls and interesting rock formations on this section of trail. It was beautiful. I should also note that the trail was extremely muddy and slippery the last few days and me and others fall multiple times. I was covered in mud but it was still a great time. At one point I took a detour to one of the hostels and resupplied on some of my snacks, then ate some lunch there. I arrived at my campsites close to dark, or at dark, most days but it was worth it.I woke up early on my birthday (May 25th) and started hiking at 7:30am, which is one of my earliest starts. I realized what people mean by ""the early hikers eat the spider webs."" When nobody has hiked before you, all the webs from the evening before are still up and you walk your face right into them. I was waving my trekking poles around in front of me to knock down as many as I could. Who knows how many spiders I had on me. It's another good reason not to leave too early every day! Although I'm definitely adjusting to getting up in the mornings. It's very difficult to sleep through the birds chirping around 6am and sun light shining all around you at 7.I ended up hiking into town on the 25th really quickly. I was pacing at about 3.5 miles per hour and arrived in town at about 10 am. I have now officially entered Virginia and have hiked through 3 states. Storm had taken a zero in Damascus so he waited around for me and we met at Mojo's to eat breakfast. He bought be a birthday breakfast consisting of chocolate chip pancakes, eggs, and bacon. It was worth the fast paced hiking. He hiked out in the afternoon.Mostly my day was very relaxing. I received my resupply box from my parents and they included some Oreo Cookies and a birthday gift in my box. Lately it's been much warmer than the rest of the year and I was happy to receive my warm weather sleeping clothes, which I had requested they send. I had booked a cabin at Woodchuck Hostel prior to arriving in town and it apparently doesn't have air conditioning. I was hoping it would cool down in the evening and eventually it did. Ompi was having ankle issues and was still in town at the hostel. I haven't seen him since trail days and I was happy to have some of my trail friends around to celebrate with. I've played a lot of cornhole at the hostel and brewery over the last 2 days. The hostel owner is pretty good and sometimes makes bets with people to either pay him more if they lose, or get a free stay if they win. I didn't challenge him.Little Grizz ended up taking a zero in our last town so he didn't make it to Damascus until later in the day on May 26th. He's not taking a zero so he should be back on me and Rambler's basic schedule. I have a good group of people I've been hiking around. I think as time goes on you find people of similar mindsets and hiking paces that you can hike around without having to majorly alter your schedule.","US-19

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536075,"Often when people talk about thru hikers hiking in Virginia, they say many will get the ""Virginia blues."" It's said that the honeymoon phase of the hiking is over and people start to get bored by the repetition and staying in the same state. Virginia is about 550 miles of the trail, so about 1/4 of it. My experience in Virginia so far has been nothing but great and I'm still having an amazing time. The last few days were unique and wonderful. Also, privys are back at the shelters. Since the Smoky Mountains there either haven't been privys or they were just so bad that I didn't want to use them.On the way out of Damascus, Rambler, Little Grizz, and I stopped by all the outfitters in town (there are 3) to look around and we each ended up buying some summer hiking socks (mine are for sleeping in). I was eyeing a green rain kilt instead of my rain pants but it was just too expensive for what it was. We also stopped by Mojo's to drink frappes before beginning the hike. It has been hotter this past week than it has been the last 2 months.As I hiked with Rambler and Little Grizz we came across a stream with a nice camping area adjacent to it. Little Grizz mentioned that he's always wanted to camp by a stream. Even though we were aiming to do 10 or so miles that day, I told him that there are no rules so if he wanted to camp we should do it! That's what we did and the calming sound of the stream made for a good night's sleep. I should mention that when I was hanging my bear bag at this camp site my rock bag got stuck in the branches and I pulled hard on the rope and the rock bag came straight for my head. I ducked but not fast enough and the bag grazed my head. It definitely didn't feel good but could have been much worse if it had hit my face. I have a small knot and bruise on my head now.A portion of the AT near Damascus goes on the Creeper Trail, a converted logging track. I'm not sure of the exact distance but it's a bike path that they will shuttle you to the top of it and you ride downhill the entire way back to Damascus. I want to bike it someday. Rambler and I stopped to take a break at a bench along the Creeper Trail and we watched all the bikers go by. Some would stop to take pictures of the sign pointing out the Appalachian Trail. Apparently it's really well known in other countries that don't have long trails. The US is fortunate to have multiple long trails such as the Appalachian Trail, the Pacific Crest Trail, the Continental Divide Trail, and the Florida Trail. There might be more but these are the better known ones.There have been a couple places over the last few days with great views. The best views were at the Thomas Knob Shelter campsites. The sites are on a bald with minimal trees blocking the views so you can clearly see the mountains for sunrise and sunset. I camped near Little Grizz, Gasket, and Sidewinder. There were also ponies roaming around our camping area, which I thought would only be in the adjacent Grayson Highlands. One of them couldn't have been more than a week old. Gasket was pretty excited about the ponies but was concerned they would run through his hammock during the night. They did not. He described the baby pony as looking like us hikers when we first started using our trekking poles. We all laughed because it was an accurate description. I asked Sidewinder to wake me up so I could see the sunrise the following morning. I haven't specifically seen any out here until that morning. Usually the birds start chirping around 5:45 am and the sun starts coming up at 6:15 am. Although I hear and see these things I don't typically get up until around 7.The following day I hiked though the Grayson Highlands, which is typically where the wild ponies live. They were introduced to the area to control vegetation. I got pictures of a few but I'm not a huge fan of horses so I kept my distance and got out of that area quickly (but not without climbing some rock outcrops to enjoy the views).My final day of hiking before my resupply was 19 miles but the terrain wasn't too bad. The shelter here is very unique. There is a (cold) shower and a nearby visitors center that you can have pizza delivered to. Little Grizz, Rambler, and I ordered some pizza and dessert breadsticks to share. It was awesome. There is quite the crowd near this shelter so we ate over near the visitor's center. Afterwards I decided to brave the cold shower so I could feel clean tonight. With the warmer weather and increased sweating I have been smelling extra bad, as does everybody else. The water was so cold! I guess the warming mechanism is broken. It didn't help that I waited to take the shower until after the sun had set. It was worth it though. I smell really good and I'm full with pizza. That made the 19 mile walk worth it.Tomorrow we will all go into town to do laundry, possibly stop by the city pool to take hot showers (and swim), and purchase our resupply items. I'm not taking a zero in town but it will likely be a low milage day.Update: We are too slow at resupplying and had to take a zero.","Damascus, VA
","Marion, VA","May 31, Tue",19.20
Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537578,"I braved one more cold shower at Partnership Shelter before heading out on the next stretch of hiking. I had to purchase another bag in town for bear bagging since I now require more food for the same amount of time. Rambler and I decided that we need to stop at the smaller towns along the way for resupply so we can get items more regularly and thus, carry less stuff. The first day out of town is always rough because of the weight. We realized that we do higher milage days when we're closer to town since our packs are lighter.We left Marion later in the day than we usually would for hiking and decided we should stop to eat at The Barn, which was 10ish miles away. It's a local restaurant and sounded good. On the way there we saw a sign for a single room school house, which offers a variety of trail magic from the locals. We stopped in and hung out a while with the other thru hikers. There was fresh fruit, lemon bread, sodas, and toiletry items. Afterwards we continued to The Barn and the food was pretty good but it caused us to have to night hike to our next location. There weren't a lot of great options for bear bagging at our camping location and looking for a spot in the dark was not ideal.Over the past few days I've been seeing more snakes since the temperatures have been higher. I encountered a rattlesnake at one point. I was walking and listening to a podcast when I heard that really distinct rattle sound. I don't think I've ever had a snake rattle at me before but my instincts reacted to the sound. I jumped back and right ahead of me was a large rattlesnake trying to cross the trail. I stood there not knowing what to do for a while until finally the snake continued on his way and I was able to hike on. The experience made me jumpy about sounds for the remainder of the day.Our second day out from Marion had a major storm roll through so Little Grizz, Rambler, and I waited it out under a tree near the road since the next part of the trail was through a grass field and totally exposed. While we were waiting for the storm to stop, a car dropped by and gave us some sodas, then Slug caught up to us. He was with us a Woodchuck Hostel in Damascus but was behind because his family visited him. He hiked quickly after that and caught us in Marion but needed to resupply the day we hiked out. Since he caught up to us he's been with our group ever since.We crossed several streams during the last stretch of trail and one of them was on a perfect day for swimming. I had left camp before the group and jumped in while waiting for them. The water was super cold but I adjusted quickly. The group wasn't far behind and were excited to join once they arrived. We eventually had 8 or so thru hikers swimming in the stream. It felt good to take a semi-bath and rinse off, even if we couldn't use soap in the water (it's bad for the ecosystem). Once it got closer to evening we were planning on hiking into the night but as we reached Chestnut Knob Shelter there appeared to be a looming thunderstorm. We decided it was smarter to camp and set our tents up, then went into the shelter to cook. The shelter is one of the few that's fully enclosed with a locking door and everything. The storm was intense! It was really windy and rainy, which continued into the night. We all stayed dry in the tents with no issues but Rambler apparently had issues with his hammocking. He had to get up several times to fix his rain fly which kept coming unstaked because of the wind. He said he eventually tied the ends to trees.The next morning the weather forecast looked like rain all day so Little Grizz decided to take a zero at the shelter; however, Rambler, Slug, and I decided to ""embrace the suck"" (our motto for the less pleasant days) and hike out anyway. Not only did we plan to hike out, we decided we'd go 22 miles to get to Bland, VA and stay at a hotel. It only rained for about 3 hours but other than that the weather wasn't that bad. The rain actually brought cooler temperatures so I'm glad we made the choice we did. On our final 7 miles of the day we realized we'd likely have to night hike but we actually hiked so fast that we didn't have to. We told Slug we'd call him Turbo Slug from now on because he hiked so fast that we could barely keep up. Rambler and I would run to catch up and he'd be gone again. We got to the road that intersected town around 9:30pm and called Bubba (a shuttle driver) to take us to the hotel. We slept well after all that walking. It was my longest day so far.We didn't stay another night at the hotel but we did hang out in Bland for a while. The only available laundry was 2 medal wash bins at the hotel and a clothes line. It took FOREVER to do the laundry. One thing this trip has shown is thankfulness for technology advances and modern conveniences. Simple things like getting water and going to the store are time consuming endeavors out here. Once we finished with laundry we hiked 2 miles to the next shelter, so at least we did some hiking.The following day Little Grizz hiked a marathon distance day and caught up to us while we hiked to Trent's Grocery (to resupply and eat). We weren't initially going to camp there but it was only $6 to tent, shower, and do laundry. I'm glad we stayed. The location we camped at was an open field and the weather was perfect for star gazing. Most of us stayed up late to wait for the best views of the sky. It was beautiful. We could see satellites from time to time, meteors, and (very faintly) the Milky Way. This made the hiking out from Trent's Grocery rough though after the limited sleep, even though the elevation profile was mild. We stopped by a waterfall and took a break and hiked most of the way to Pearisburg so we could get into town early the following day.We are taking a zero in Pearisburg right now. Our hotel has a pool so we went to the Goodwill across the street to buy swim wear. Rambler bought a pair of jeans and cut them into jorts. It's hilarious. I told him I'm going to take a picture but he said that's not going to happen. We got one of the last rooms yesterday and it was a smoking room with questionable upkeep. The shower only worked with hot water, no cold, so it was VERY hot. We requested to change rooms the following day. The new room is much nicer and I look forward to going to the pool today.","Marion, VA

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538966,"We left late out of Pearisburg after getting our resupply and some Dairy Queen. We weren't able to get a ride back to the trail so we ended up walking the 0.9-mile distance to get there. We had some difficulty relocating the trail from that location but eventually we came across it. It was a long, uphill assent out of town with limited water spots and we were doing it in the hottest part of the day. The first evening out we all hiked up supplies to make tacos and they turned out awesome. Sometimes when you leave town you can carry items that are slightly heavier, just as long as you eat them in the first day. Rambler decided to stay at that shelter but Slug and I hiked out around sunset to get a little further. I was trying to get to a set meeting location (several days later) to have my friend Courtney join me for a few days. That evening was Slug's first night hiking experience and we saw quite a few deer. We think we hiked about 5 miles in the dark to a random campsite along the trail. We hiked fairly quickly and good distances after leaving the last town so I could meet Courtney but we also enjoyed the journey. There was a spot called The Captain's where you cross a river on a small zipline to a guy's house where you can camp, drink free soda, charge devices, and hang out. We didn't camp there but did hang around for a while to relax and charge our phones. We helped The Captain restock the soda supply in the fridge. He came out with a wheelbarrow of sodas and we formed an assembly line and passed them up. He said it was 144 sodas and would probably last 1.5 days. It's very generous of him. I connected with Courtney the following day. I hiked out before the guys and moved faster than I ever have in my haste to reach her at a reasonable time. I completed 10 miles before noon. Basically, I wasn't taking any breaks and was hiking at maximum speed. She texted me that they reached the meeting location early and were waiting. I updated her in the afternoon that I would be there at 1pm. I got to the road crossing around that time and they weren't there so I suspected that I misinterpreted where they were meeting me. I decided I would hitchhike to the store where I assumed they were waiting. I caught a ride with the first car going by (I have a 100% success rate for solo hitchhiking now) and when I got to the store...they weren't there. One of my fellow hikers said they gave him a ride to the store then headed back to meet me. I just missed them. There was no cellphone reception so I couldn't even contact her to let her know. I ended up getting a ride back to the trailhead with a local to meet Courtney, then they took me back to the store to resupply, then we finally started hiking around 3 or 4pm. The beginning hike for Courtney wasn't an easy one. There were some steep uphill sections and with the late start time we only made it to the first shelter, which was 4 miles from town. Unfortunately that shelter was also 0.5 miles off the trail, down a steep hill. Not ideal. The following day of hiking was just as challenging. Although the elevation profile wasn't steep, there were a lot of rocks inclined at about 30 degrees that you had to walk along. It really tested the ankles. We went 6 miles on that day to the next shelter where people kept showing up to camp. I haven't seen that many hikers in one area since Trail Days. I assume it's because it was close to the weekend. You're probably wondering where Slug and Rambler were this whole time. When they reached the road crossing that I met Courtney at, they caught a ride with someone going to Blacksburg and decided they'd go there too. They went to Chipotle (somewhere we've been discussing that we wanted to find) and sent me photos of their endeavor. I've tried to give them a hard time about it until I could go myself. They left Blacksburg on Courtney's second day of hiking and met us at the shelter we were staying at. The next few days looked like rough hiking so Courtney had her parents pick her up so she could bypass it. It was probably a wise choice because the terrain was really challenging. We hiked through Dragon's Tooth the following day and got caught in a thunderstorm on the ridge of the mountain. Rambler, Slug, and I ended up sitting under a rock to wait out the storm but we still got soaking wet. Once we arrived at Dragon's Tooth I slipped on some wet roots and banged my shin up pretty good. I had a huge welt and a good bruise going now! The hike down from Dragon's Tooth was just as challenging. We had to scramble down the rocks and were not quite sure how a southbound hiker would get up the rocks with their packs on. We ended up getting to Four Pines Hostel around 10pm and it was great to be able to shower and dry our things out. Everyone was very impressed with our dedication and kept giving us food. I loved the hostel setup. They have a 3 car garage that has been converted into a lounge area with tons if chairs and couches in a circle near the middle of the room and some beds along the edges. It was full when we got there so we ended up sleeping in the modified barn. It was my first barn sleeping experience. It was actually quite pleasant. Rambler almost hung his hammock on column supported by a couple of screws (which would have taken the barn down if he sat in it) but luckily Slug noticed the poor support and Rambler moved to a different location. It could have been bad. When we left the hostel we resupplied at the Catawba Grocery. They really need to stop calling these places grocery stores. The last 3 places we've been to have been gas station convenience stores that have been called a grocery store in the name. It's not that they are bad, but you're just not expecting it. They did have a small kitchen where we got burgers and some ice cream. We got a late start to hike the 11 miles to McAfee Knob and meet Courtney again. She was at the top of McAfee with her dad when we were leaving town. The main goal was to get there by sunset, so I wasn't worried. We got to the parking area 4 miles from McAfee just as Courtney was getting back to the parking area, so I was able to see her again. We speed hiked up to the top of McAfee and made it right at sunset. It was one of the most beautiful places I've been and I got some great photos. Living on the edge! Unfortunately there was a massive thunderstorm rolling in so we couldn't stay too long on the exposed ridge. We hiked to the next shelter to get set up before the rain started. It was intense! The lightening looked like strobe lights from the inside of my tent. I waited out the main part of the storm before going to the shelter to make dinner.The day after McAfee my group and I hiked 15 miles into Daleville to meet my parents, who will be hiking with me through the week. We stayed in town overnight and since my dad had a rental car we were able to go into the next town to eat at Chipotle and Starbucks! Now I don't have to hold it over the guys' heads that they went without me. It was great. Now I'll just need to find a Panera Bread...My parents have been with me for 3 days now and have done pretty well. I've been showing them the ropes for setting up camp, water filtration, etc. My dad has been slowed down by his pack weight. When I asked him what weighed so much in his bag and he said the only extra thing he had was cards, I believed him. Man was I wrong. As we hiked on I found out he had 2 roles of packaging tape for the trip home, a pack of 20 AAA batteries, a handheld flashlight and a headlamp (I don't know why you would need both), 10 pens (I'm not sure what the logic was behind that), a bottle of mouthwash, 3 sets of headphones, and 2 decks of cards. Clearly he wasn't paying attention when I was deciding my essential items and counting my pack weight. I trail named him Pack Mule. I think he quickly realized why it's a bad idea to carry extra items. It makes climbing mountains much more challenging. We had him give away the rolls of tape to a guy getting off the trail and gave the batteries away to thru-hikers. We're still working on having him throw away the mouthwash. It's been really warm lately so I purchased a sleeping bag liner to use instead of my sleeping bag due to the heat. My parents brought it with them. I also had them bring my new hiking shoes and inserts. They look so clean! I took a side by side photo for comparison. Currently we're staying the night at a campground with a pool and showers. We've discovered ticks on my dad, Slug, and myself in the last week so we're taking a short break from the woods since tomorrow we tackle a fairly significant uphill climb. My parents are going to bypass this main climb and meet us near the top later in the day tomorrow.","Pearisburg, VA

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539746,"As usual, leaving the campground was a chore. We ordered breakfast at the camp kitchen (it was amazing) and watched Despicable Me 2. It's so great to have a selection of movies to watch and choose from. Sometimes at hotels you can search the TV for movies but it's rare to find movies you want to watch in their entirety. It's a luxury. We also spent time relaxing and delaying the hiking, since we knew what was coming, a sizeable uphill. Slug and I got some ice cream, which probably didn't help with the climb to follow. The scoops were VERY generous.It was a wise choice to have my parents bypass the uphill section out of the camping area. It consisted of about 10 miles of uphill climbing (some downhill mixed in, but mostly uphill). Weather wise, the day had a mix of everything. It started off really hot and humid and later in the day it started raining with a threat of thunderstorms. Once Rambler, Slug, and I got to the shelter, right before the set meeting location with my parents, we decided to wait out some of the rain in the cover of the shelter. It ended up being a good idea that we killed time at the shelter. My parents planned on hiking to Apple Orchard Falls then going from there to the Appalachian Trail where we would meet them at the junction. I was able to talk with my mom throughout the day and she initially said they found the waterfall but couldn't figure out how to get to the AT from there. She said the falls weren't that great. I informed her that I thought they might have seen some other waterfall because the one they were going to was 200 feet tall and I heard it was beautiful. They ended up walking back 0.8 miles to a map of the area, locating the correct waterfall, and then heading back to where they hoped the AT was. Apparently the trail to/from the waterfall was not clearly marked. This was confirmed by another thru-hiker who made the trip off trail to see it. My parents said they ended up asking a person who was sleeping in their tent on a forest service road if they knew how to get to the AT from their location. Luckily they were pointed in the correct direction. They did see a bear on their hike back to the trail. I haven't seen a bear in 800 miles and they saw one in 4 days. I had a feeling that would happen. Rambler, Slug, and I waited at the meeting location until dark and scoped out places to camp. The options were limited for tenting. An area off the Blue Ridge Parkway, down a side trail, seemed to be our only option due to the time of day. Eventually I went down the waterfall trail to find my parents because we were beginning to worry. I found them 0.3 to 0.5 miles away. Now they have experienced night hiking. Bear bagging over the last few days hasn't gone the best for my dad and Rambler. When we were camping off the Blue Ridge Parkway I was trying to assist my dad with hanging his bag. The first try, he missed the goal limb and landed on a different one and tried to pull the rock bag back over the limb. You can't do that, it can get stuck or come back and hit you in the head (I have experience with that one). It got slightly caught and we were able to retrieve the line and bag. I explained that you have to let the loose end over the tree limb and start over, patience is required. He threw it a second time, landed on a small tree and proceeded to try and pull the rock bag back again. He almost pulled down the tree (Rambler, located nearby was concerned for his own safety) and I told my dad that if that bag came off it was going to hit him in the face. I stood back. Well, it never came off the tree. The rock bag wrapped around the branch and is now a permanent tree ornament. He now knows why I said not to do it that way. Luckily the carabiner somehow came detached from the bag and we were able to retrieve that and the line. The following day, Rambler was trying to hang a line. His line is too short and Slug was attempting to help him when a section of the rope wrapped around a limb. They tried to pull it back but it slingshotted around a limb and is now also a tree ornament. Lil Griz let Rambler hang on his line and we'll have to get him a new one in the next town. As I said, not a good week for bear bagging. Lately there have been major storm systems going through with a lot of lightening involved. Some of the strikes have been very close. It can be pretty scary. One evening a particularly bad storm was going through and Rambler was hammocking on a questionably alive tree. After a main portion of the rain storm I heard my parents moving around (at 4:30am) and asked how they liked that storm. My mom said their tent was leaking, it was funneling rain inside, and they were soaking wet. I got out of my tent and realized they hadn't tightened their rain fly adequately, so I fixed it for them and went back to bed. They said the tent faired better after that. The rain let up just enough around 9 or 10am the following day so we could pack up our wet gear and start hiking. It was 8 miles to our goal road crossing on a mostly downhill trend. The thunderstorms picked back up later in the day and while Slug and I were walking we saw a tree fall in the woods. Sometimes you hear them fall but hardly ever see it. It confirms my irrational fear of having a tree fall on me when I'm sleeping. Towards the end of the day we arrived at James River Footbridge just as the thunderstorm got worse. There was lightening overhead but it didn't look like it would stop so we all decided we'd have to cross and take our chances. Slug, Rambler, Lil Griz, and I waited for my parents then we all crossed together. Once we reached the road crossing we knew getting a hitch for 6 people was going to be tough so Rambler and Lil Griz stood by the road and my mom eventually joined them to add a female and increase our odds. A truck eventually pulled over for them and was able to take all 6 of us into Glasgow, VA. It was quite a rainy ride in the back of the truck but it was way better than walking 6 miles into town. The town of Glasgow has a pavilion they built for hikers where you can sleep in a shelter type area (which was full) or tent. We had a small break in the rain, set up our tents, then headed to do laundry. Everything was wet. Once laundry started we headed to a pizza place and got some dinner. My mom and I headed back to check on our laundry and we struck up a conservation with the owner, telling him about my parents' experience in the rain. He ended up offering to my parents that they could sleep in the laundromat if their stuff was wet. My dad checked and apparently their tent was already pooling with water so he took the guy up on that. The owner said he never offers this to people and we were very grateful. They wouldn't have had a good night's sleep. We hiked for 2 days after Glasgow without my parents due to another big climb and they went to see McAfee Knob. We're now in Lexington, VA. We stayed in a hotel last night and are taking a zero today. We haven't had a zero since Pearisburg and I think we're all feeling run down. We're all (including my parents) going to stay at a KOA Campground tonight and my parents are flying home tomorrow.","Middle Creek Campground

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540988,"The KOA campground was a nice camping spot. We were able to go by the pool (my dad was the only one who jumped completely in) and play games in the game room. We also played a couple games of horse shoe, which I haven't played in years. It apparently isn't my game. I was on a team with Slug and he scored most of our points. I managed to score a couple towards the end. The following morning my parents drove us around to run our necessary errands and eat before heading back to the trail. We got back on the trail at noon and it was hot outside! Whoever said Virginia is more flat than the other states on the trail is a liar. My group has decided that it's a myth thru-hikers pass on to future thru-hikers as a perpetual joke. The days out of Buena Vista, VA involved multiple 1000+ foot assents and descents. On that first day out some members of the group decided we should start hiking earlier and do more miles before the heat of the day, rest in the middle of the day, then continue hiking. Great in theory but it didn't work out so well. Rambler was the only one who woke up really early the following morning to get hiking. I think the rest of us were tired. We did leave earlier than usual though. I think messing up your natural sleep patterns makes you sleepy all day. I like waking with the birds and sun and going to bed shortly after the sun sets (out here...in my regular life I'm a night person and sleep in in the mornings).On the day Rambler left really we all stopped at Priest Shelter before a major decent and assent the following day. Rambler had been there for 3 hours prior to our arrival. At Priest Shelter there is a tradition to write your ""trail confessions"" in the trail log book (rather than the typical ""I was here and saw this today"" entries). They're really entertaining to read. Rambler was the only one from our group to write in the book (personally I couldn't decide what to write) but I won't spill the beans on his ""confession"".We camped near the junction of the Priest Shelter and trail so we would be ready for the 3000-foot decent then assent the following day. While we were setting up there was a random rain storm that came and went over a span of about 20 minutes, then it never rained again that evening. It felt like the sporadic rain storms that go through Florida every afternoon. The bugs were particularly bad at our campsite so we made a fire, which keeps them away. It's amazing how well it works. As I was getting ready for bed I saw a little mouse running around camp. In the morning we realized that overnight this mouse ate some of my cereal, all of Lil Griz's vitamins, and nibbled on Slug's Camelbak mouthpiece. You can see the teeth marks in the plastic. We were joking that the mouse will turn into some kind of super mouse after eating all those vitamins, then after eating the vitamins it was thirsty and needed some of Slug's water. The 3000-foot decent and assent out of Priest Shelter was intense. You'd think going downhill would be relatively easy but going downhill for 4 miles will start to hurt your knees. The mostly uphill section lasted for about 6 miles. We all stopped at the shelter 1/3 of the way up and took an hour nap. It got me through the last part but I was hurting. We think we've seen the last of the big, continuous climbs for a while. We were rewarded for our efforts by reaching the gap where you can get to The Devil's Backbone brewery. When Slug and I got there a lady driving by asked if we needed a ride. We told her we had one more member (Rambler) and that he stopped for the bathroom but would be coming shortly. Within 5 minutes we saw him running down the hill. The brewery was strong motivation apparently. We arrived at the brewery and ordered food, which was really good, then headed inside for trivia night. Our team consisted of Rambler, Slug, me, Bojangles (a guy who I've been around off and on throughout the trip), and Bojangles' friend. Bojangles' girlfriend, Spunk, had to wait outside with their 2 dogs. Despite not being particularly good at trivia, our team started off really well. Unfortunately we self destructed towards the end and got second to last. The brewery is very hiked friendly. It has free camping for hikers so we stayed over in the woods. One of the employees said that they're looking to create a full campground for hikers compete with shower and laundry facilities. They said it will likely be ready next year. The brewery also has a hiker breakfast for $5 consisting of coffee, a sausage biscuit with cheese, eggs, potatoes, and fresh fruit. The employees kept asking how everything was and gave us a ride back to the trailhead when we were done. It was a great experience. The elevation profile has been more mild since the last major climbs before the brewery. It's supposed to be like this the remainder of Virginia. I also saw my first bear! I was almost to the shelter for the evening when I heard something walking in the bushes. I walked further down the trail towards the sound. Sure enough there was a bear walking into the woods! I got a picture and video and when I got far enough away I ran to the shelter to tell everyone about it. It took about 850 miles but I finally saw a bear.The following day we arrived in Waynesboro, VA. Rambler left early and Lil Griz, Slug, and I left slightly later. When we got to the road a guy driving by offered to give us a ride without us even asking, which was awesome. We requested to be taken to the Panera Bread which is my favorite restaurant and somewhere I've been hoping to visit. This is the first time we've come across one. Waynesboro is by far the biggest town we've come to. The guy who gave us a ride said this is the first time hikers have requested to go there. I was happy. It was the first time Lil Griz had ever been to a Panera. We went to Goodwill after eating to get some town clothes. Sometimes we'll do that and redonate the clothes at the conclusion of our town visit. We called someone from the local trail angel list (there's a list of people who can give hikers rides around town) and they picked us up and took us to the free camping at the YMCA. It was great to have a free place to stay and shower but some of the characters there were shady and likely homeless, not hikers. We took turns going to the showers so someone would always be with our stuff. Backpacking gear is not cheap. Lil Griz stayed at the campsite when Slug and I went to do laundry. Rambler caught up with him later. Once we were clean, we all went to a Chinese buffet. It was incredible! They had so much variety and the food was delicious. On Saturday we got a ride from Rambler's friend to visit a farmer's market in the adjacent town of Staunton, VA. Trying to fit us all into the car was entertaining. We put most of our packs in the trunk but Rambler had to hold Slug's pack in the front seat. The girl's daughter was at one side of the back seat, Lil Griz sat in the middle, Slug sat on the other side and I sat on Slug's lap. Where there's a will, there's a way. At the market I purchased some homemade food items as a part of my resupply. It's been nice having something different and homemade. You don't get that much out here. My friends Francee and Jesse, and their baby Gabriel, (who were visiting the Carolina's and drove to see me) met me at the market. We didn't stay too much longer though and Slug and I headed back to Waynesboro with them. Lil Griz and Rambler headed back with Rambler's friend. I enjoyed getting to spend time with Francee and Jesse. It's always nice to see familiar faces from back home. They left in the evening.Lil Griz, Slug, and I went to see the new Tarzan movie at the local movie theater after Francee and Jesse left. It always amazes me the things you miss. We have been looking for a movie theater for a month or so. Granted, we had to walk almost a mile to the theater with no sidewalks. It wasn't a problem when it was light outside but definitely scary walking on the road in the dark. We resupplied in the morning and ate at Panera again. I got some bagels and pastries for the road. Rambler, Slug, and I have been hiking in Shenandoah National Park for the last few days. Look Griz took an extra zero in Waynesboro so he's not with us at the moment. It was rainy the last couple days so our mileage hasn't been great. We got a late start out of town so we only did 8 miles to the first shelter. In the morning it was raining but the radar said it would stop later in the day so we napped and rested in the shelter until 2ish before hiking. Lil Griz did catch up to us before we left but planned to stay at that shelter so we haven't seen him since but I'm confident he'll catch up. Slug forecasted that it would rain later in the day so we stealth camped and didn't hike as far as we planned. It didn't rain until 10pm, so we like to give him a hard time about his poor forecasting. We told him he clearly wanted to stop early so he must have made up a story about rain. They have restaurants called Waysides in the Shenandoah's so we stopped to eat in one last night. We had to walk a mile to get to it but it was all downhill. We were lucky enough to get a ride back up to the campground where we left our gear, so we didn't have to walk uphill. The campground also had showers and laundry, so we took advantage of that. As usual, we got delayed by being in society and decided to camp at the campground; however, it was late and the office for camping was about 2 miles away. We didn't want to walk there. We looked around the Appalachian Trail for a good stealth camping spot but found nothing and were getting tired. Ultimately we decided to camp behind the campstore building and just wake up early to pack up before anybody noticed. Our plan worked and we're back on the trail preparing to meet one of Slug's friends at a road crossing later today.","Buena Vista, VA
",Shenandoah National Park,"Jul 06, Wed",4.30
Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542541,"The Shenandoah's are really well maintained. A lot of the trail has the adjacent vegetation cut back so you don't have to worry about ticks getting on you (my own personal fear) and it just looks nice. I really enjoyed the final hiking of the Shenandoah's. Although there are still significant mountain climbs from time to time, it is a lot flatter than other areas we've hiked in. We wish we had taken better advantage of the minimal elevation profile but the huts that the park want you to sleep in (or near) are all spaced about 11 to 13 miles apart, which means you either have to walk that distance or walk 20+ miles. Doing 20+ miles is never easy. One of the great things about the Shenandoah's is that there are campsites with showers, laundry, and snacks almost every other day and Waysides where you can get grilled food almost every other day. It's a luxury. We've had to readjust to not having these things in our regular hiking. I saw 3 bears in the Shenandoah's on different days. The first bear was at a picnic area. We noticed some day hikers pointing it out and saw it in the bushes. Shortly after, it crossed the road into the picnic area, totally unconcerned with the people. It clearly had its eye on some sort of food item. When I encountered my second bear, I was focused on my hiking and another hiker signaled for me to look to my right. I walked right by a bear headed down the hill. I wonder how many bears I've walked by and just never saw. The third bear wasn't too exciting. It was in the bushes and I only really saw its back. Lately it has been really hot and humid. There have been multiple heat advisories. As much as we want to start hiking early, we have to (or want to) take so many breaks that we get to camp late, which makes us too tired to wake up early. The most challenging section we competed was called The Roller Coaster. It's a series of rapid assents and descents over a span of about 15 miles. Towards the end of it Slug put his feet in a stream and the little fish started eating the dead skin on his feet. Naturally, Ramblr and I had to try it too (Lil Griz was ahead of us). The fish nibbling on our feet felt really weird. It was a fish pedicure. We also stopped at a castle-style hostel on the top of a hill to get some snacks. We each ate a pint of ice cream to help cool us down. We call that training for the half-gallon challenge. (Near the halfway point of the trail there's an AT tradition to eat a half gallon of ice cream within an hour. We thought the challenge was in Harper's Ferry but apparently we have a little longer to wait.) We had to night hike the day we did the Roller Coaster due to all the stops. I saw my first raccoon and a small rattlesnake during that night hike. We quickly realized we should have gotten batteries for our headlamps at the hostel though. By the time we got to camp both Ramblr's and my headlamps were basically dead and we couldn't see anything. Slug had to help us with hanging bear bags, setting things up, and generally seeing what we were doing. Always have backup batteries. Ramblr has had multiple issues with directions and missing turns since my last post. We joked that he should be renamed Wrong Way. Once he walked past a post in Shenandoah findicating the direction to the picnic area we all planned to stop at. When he didn't show up before us we figured he must have missed it. He did eventually show up but walked almost a mile extra. The second time the trail branched off to the left from a really defined trail. It crossed my mind that someone could miss it but I saw Slug and Lil Griz; however, Ramblr had been in the lead so I assumed that's why I didn't see him. He came running up behind us a good amount of time later since he had missed the turn. Apparently he ran for almost 3 miles to catch up to us once he realized his error. The last time he went the wrong way, it was out of a campsite. He walked straight instead of turning into the AT. Luckily he only went 50 yards or so out of the way and turned around when the trail he was on appeared to end. My group has now officially passed through 4 states and are out of Virginia (which is about 1/4 of the trail)! We reached Harpers Ferry on July 15th but arrived in town after the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) headquarters had closed for the day which means we weren't able to get our pictures taken for the thru-hiker album (that day). We stayed at a hotel in the adjacent town but it was really sketchy. The girl who gave Slug and me a ride to the hotel told us the Motel 6 would have been a better option. We were given attitude by the lady at the front desk when we asked for more towels. She wanted an extra $22 since we had 4 people and she said it wasn't fair that we were paying the same amount that 2 people would pay. When we made the reservation through Travelocity we disclosed that we had 4 people AND we were all present at check in. I showed her the confirmation email and ultimately she conceded that we could have the towels. We took a zero in Harpers Ferry since it's been over a week since our last one. In the morning we left our hotel and were offered a ride before we even started hitchhiking. We went first to the post office for Ramblr to get a package and then mail stuff off. Unfortunately we didn't get there until 30 minutes before it closed and I wasn't able to get my box from the ATC and go through it before mailing items back. I'll have to carry them to the next town. Once we made it to the ATC, we had our individual photos taken for the official book. You fill in your name, trail name, direction of travel, and email address for the official book so other hikers can find you. It was fun looking through the book and seeing who is still on the trail and when they passed thorough here. There were some people who I thought had gotten off trail when really they've just been ahead of me. The stay in Harper's Ferry was enjoyable. The people are friendly and some drivers gave us rides to help us get around since we had our packs with us. The evening of our zero we booked at the Motel 6, as recommended by the girl who gave us a ride the previous day. It was amazing! The staff was friendly, the rooms were really nice, they gave us extra towels, and they had laundry (which we didn't see on Travelocity). One of the workers said they're getting updated photos taken tomorrow to show the upgraded motel. Today we head back to the trail. I'm at the ATC finishing by blog update while the guys went ahead and started hiking. It is almost 2 pm after all and we are planning on going 10 miles. The next stretch of trail rapidly goes through 3 states over about 30 to 40 miles. Some people attempt the ""4 state challenge"" which involves starting in Virginia and going through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and going into Pennsylvania all in one day...we aren't attempting that.","Shenandoah National Park

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543151,"As my group just reached the midway point of our journey, I put together a compilation of my thoughts that I've had up to this point. I also had Slug and Ramblr put together their thoughts in their own words.Luigi's Thoughts: When I started my hike at Amicalola Falls, I didn't fully know what to expect. Obviously I had done a lot of research and had an idea but you can never totally prepare. I was so nervous that first morning that I went to the bathroom every 15 minutes and felt like I was going to puke. Even after the first day when I could barely lift my legs as I got to Springer Mountain, which is technically the zero mile marker for the trail, I wondered how far I would make it, even though I knew I had the ability and will to go all the way. Even in the first two weeks as I struggled through 8 mile hiking days I wondered how I'd ever consistently do 15-mile days. Now 15-18 mile days are the norm. Here are some of the most prominent things I've thought of over the last few months. I wrote them down as I walked so they're not in any particular order.  -I feel just as capable, if not more so, than I thought I'd be before coming out here. I thought I'd have more pain or emotional breakdowns and struggles than I've had. It's certainly not easy, and I have good and bad days, but luckily the good far outweigh the bad.-I was expecting major foot problems like blisters and loss of toenails but haven't experienced this. Sure I get the occasional minor blister but it's bearable. In my studies before the trail everyone emphasized that those things are a symptom of thru-hiking. I realize now that that's not the normal for everyone, but there's still time. I do know people this has been an issue for and some have had to leave the trail so I'm glad I've been able to avoid it. -You pack for your fears. Mine is food. I always over pack food even though I realize how much I'll actually need. Running out would be my worst possible scenario, even though I'm sure my trail family wouldn't let me starve. -The people really make the trail. It's great being in nature and seeing the scenery but meeting a variety of people with a common goal is the best part. It's so easy to talk to people and everyone does the trail for different reasons.-Trail angels are great. When you get a stranger willing to help you with a ride or giving you food/drinks, it's the best. -Falling is only terrifying because every time it happens I fear I'll injure myself and not be able to continue. When I stand up after falling I inventory my injuries (bruises and scrapes so far) and am glad nothing is broken. -I don't know how people walked the trail before electronics to listen to music and books. I like time to think but too much isn't always a good thing. I've signed up for aAudible and Spotify to pass the time. I love listening to new books. -Driving in a car will be weird after not driving for 6 months. I look forward to getting places easily though. -The average non thru-hiker doesn't realize how far ""just a mile away"" is when you've already walked 15-20 miles and want to get back to camp for food. So often in town people tell us something is ""just down the street."" Usually that means several miles. Not many things are worth walking an hour or so out of the way for. -Whip-poor-wills are the most obnoxious birds I've ever heard. They make noises all through the night. Just when you think they've stopped...they start up again. -I'm amazed at how comfortable I've gotten with not wearing makeup, wearing different clothes, showering, or doing laundry for days at a time. I feel amazing after showers and laundry but I still feel okay without them for short stints of time. On that same note, day hikers smell amazing. When they pass you get a strong whiff of soap and deodorizing smells. Luckily when we're in the woods we become mostly ""nose-blind"" to the smell of other thru-hikers.-I didn't think I would meet such great hiking partners. They really enhance the trip and constantly make me laugh.-As an update to some of my former hiking partners, Storm is way ahead and just entered New York (he also has a trail journal and updates almost daily). Tranquility is close behind me and I hope she catches us within the week. Tune-up is ahead of my group and Jess and Nicole (who I met on Springer Mountain) are off the trail. -Most importantly, I love it out here. I'm not ready for it to end and I think acclimating back to ""normal"" life will be tough. Slug's Thoughts:I was asked by a member of my hiker family to write my half way thoughts about the AT, so here goes. You learn a lot about yourself while hiking the Appalachian Trail, most people have no idea what we really do everyday, what we go though mentally and physically everyday. First, I'll start with the easier of the two for me and that's physically; and for those of you who know me and my bodily injuries that says a lot in itself. All of you have seen beautiful pictures of sceneries on the AT, of wild life, and of comradely between hikers who have forged relationships through working together for the common goal and becoming a family. What most have not seen is all the time you fall due to twisted ankles, sprained knees, sore muscles and feet that are riddled with blisters and toe nails that are slowly tearing off. Now to be completely honest with all of you the toe nail thing is something thankfully I haven't had to deal with but more than some people have. The common phrase in my trail family is ""Everything hurts and I'm dying"", that should sum up how we feel. Second, is the mental aspect of the trail, this is by far the hardest part of this entire thing and it's the hardest to explain. When you first start, the excitement and adrenaline are the striving force waking you every morning, new found peaks and historic parts of this beautiful country push you forward not to say that even after all this time these things stop pushing us but the excitement and adrenaline start to fade and instead of wide eyed, newly geared hikers(I'm speaking of myself here) we are grizzled hiking veterans who know better than to stop looking down because the second you look up say goodbye to your ankle and say hello to the rocky ground ready and waiting to except your pain ridden body. I say all of that to say this, when your not talking to other hikers or taking in all the beautiful scenery you're thinking, talking to yourself, most of the time it's about stuff you miss, your family, friends, dog, food you can't have, beer, etc...etc...etc, all the weddings, birthdays, anniversaries you are missing, I think you get my point. It gets heavy and sometimes it breaks you. Most people that attempt the AT quit mostly because of mental aspect of this grind. So, why do this thing? Just like life, the trail is not all sunshine and rainbows. The trail can be a nasty place physically and mentally and I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. But it ain't about how hard ya hike. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done! (If you didn't already know I stole that from Rocky...kind of??). I am finishing this trail even if it kills me not because of pride or guilt but because I CAN DO ALL THINGS!!!https://www.gofundme.com/2a9rkks Ramblr's Thoughts:""Thoughts from under the canopy""From day .5 on the trail (approach trail) I asked myself ""what the hell did I get myself into?"". As I went up and up, praying that springer was around the next bend, I couldn't believe I took a plunge this deep. A plunge I hoped to shape me into the man I'd always aspired to be. Although I knew, like the mountains I was climbing, slowly but steadily I would get to where I needed to be, both physically and mentally. But I didn't think the challenges would arise so soon. The approach trail seriously whipped me. It whipped a lot of us. But as I sat on a rock, asking myself previously ""what the hell have I gotten myself into?"" I remember the tinniest, brightest yellow bird flew up and landed on a branch barely out of arms reach and just watched me, pitifully. I'd never seen something so elegant and so beautiful. But on second thought, maybe I had seen such creatures, maybe they've always been there, but I'd never stopped to look. That exact moment reminded me of exactly why I was attempting such an adventure. I stood right up, hefted my pack, and hiked that damn mountain. Many of us sacrifice our comforts of home and put our lives on hold to set out on this journey through the Appalachian Mountains to experience the full effect of what surrounds us and the beauty that most overlook or don't normally appreciate. I decided to hike this trail for a new appreciation of nature and for personal growth. I feel thus far I have completely gotten my money's worth. I had never been north of Tennessee or North Carolina before this trip, and I was excited to explore more of the country that I love.""1100 mile look-back""This trail has 100% put me through the ringer. If today was the day I decided to throw in the towel, you couldn't name one thing that I haven't experienced while out here. I've hiked in the rain, snow, and dead heat of the summer. I've slept through lightning storms, wind storms, and have been nudged in my hammock by a bear. I've dealt with snakes, mice, owls, and even alleged mountain lions. I've met the nicest folks on earth, and some of the worst of the worst. I've hiked in the early morning before the sun was up, and late at night long after it has gone down. I've fallen, slid, and face planted while hiking in snow, mud and over rocks. I've hid under a boulder during a lightning storm, and have swam in creeks. I've eaten fresh berries off the bushes, and not so fresh cheese that's been in my pack for 5 days. I've been so hungry I could kill, and so stuffed I could pop. Ive hitch-hiked with complete strangers, and have walked miles out of my way because I was told ""it's right up the road"". I've taken wrong turns on the trail, just to realize I have to completely backtrack up a mountain. I have physically ran down mountains trying to catch up with friends. I've worn through socks that are described as ""indestructible"" and have destroyed a pair of shoes like you wouldn't believe. I've seen views that words or photos will never describe. I've made friendships with people that will last a lifetime. I've pushed myself until I said I couldn't anymore, but kept going. I've been to 4 new states, 7 in total so far. I've lost 40 lbs, but have gained a lifetimes worth of memories. This is only the halfway point.https://www.gofundme.com/25tdymdk","Harpers Ferry, WV

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544288,"I'm now officially over halfway finished with my journey. I've now hiked out of West Virginia, which is only 4 miles of the trail, and Maryland. We've officially walked through 6 states. I'm currently in Pennsylvania. My group has consistently been hiking 15 to 18 mile days so I haven't been able to work on my blog as often. We typically leave camp around 9 or 10 (later than most thru-hikers), which means we don't get to camp until close to dark, then we're tired from hiking all the miles.When you reach the halfway point of the trail there is a store that runs the ""half gallon challenge,"" which is when hikers attempt to eat a half gallon of ice cream. A bystander told us that he would buy a hiker burger for the first person to finish. Slug finished his ice cream in 22 minutes and Ramblr finished in 50 minutes. I did my best but I only ate about 2.5 pints. I felt I'd get sick if I kept eating but the failure was a disappointing moment for me. I didn't think I'd have any issues eating ice cream! The bystander held to his word and got Slug the hiker burger. He ate the whole thing right after eating his half gallon of ice cream. That's impressive. The elevation profile has gotten significantly easier over the last few states. We're slightly behind the main ""bubble"" of hikers and we want to ensure we get to Katahdin (the northern terminus of the trail) before October 15th when it closes. You can still summit after this date but camping is closed and you have no one to help you if you get injured. We don't worry about it too much and will decide if we're on schedule in a month or so. Lately the temperatures have been in the mid 90s with the heat index hitting over 100. It's also extremely humid. I thought I'd be used to the heat since I'm from Florida, but carrying 25 to 30 pounds on your back while walking up mountains isn't something you get used to. Water has also been more scarce recently, despite several thunderstorms (which the locals informed us is rare). Luckily over the last few days the heat seems to be breaking with a series of rain storms so we have regularly gotten wet. Walking in storms isn't too bad. Putting wet clothes on the following morning is not. The gnats this summer are persistent and obnoxious. They dive into your eyes, nose, mouth, and ears. They're impossible to avoid and some of them bite. You'd think you would get a break when it rains too, but no, they only seem to go away when it's pouring. They also seem to have the strange ability to hover in front of your eyes while you're walking. I don't even know how they accomplish that. I bought a headnet to wear when they're really bad. I think Slug is considering getting one. It really helps keep the frustration away. Since leaving Virginia the trail crosses a lot of roads. In the past we would pass a road every couple of days but lately we pass multiple roads every day. Many of the shelters and campsites are even located near roads and you can hear cars all night. It's not ideal but it does leave more options for going into town to eat, rest, or escape the rain. We've done that a couple of times. One time Ramblr and I went to the grocery store to get soda and snacks and the guy who took us back to the trail dropped us off at a different road crossing against our insistence. He insisted the campsite was ""just down the hill."" In reality, the road was 0.8-miles further from our campsite than the other correct crossing. It was also dusk so the walk back to camp was not ideal. It's one of the flaws of having the trail cross so many roads. The time it worked to our benefit, there was a large storm rolling in and it was getting dark. We had a guy drive by (with a full vehicle) then come back after emptying it to get us and take us to town. That day also worked out because there was a full service Dunkin Donuts in the town. There have been more since we have gotten more north. Ramblr is pretty excited about it. I think he teared up for that first Dunkin Donuts. Pennsylvania is typically known as ""Rocksylvania"" due to the rocky nature of the trail. These rocks aren't flat. They jut out in all directions and you have to hop along trying to land on the flattest, less angled rocks. If you land on one sticking straight up it bruises your feet. If you land on the flat side of a sloped rock you'll often slide down it and falling on these rocks could do some damage to your limbs. We have hit small sections of continuous rocks but nothing like what I imagined. I still suspect there are more sections of rock coming up. This state had to get its rocky reputation for a reason. I love the small towns we walk through. Ramblr decided to get a haircut at a small barber shop in Port Clinton, PA and it's very personable. They allow hikers to hang out and charge devices. One of the patrons asked us if we sing. We said we do but only in private. He proceeded to start playing guitar and serenading us with various ""hiking type"" songs about the road or going the wrong way. He tried to get us to sing but we insisted we only do that when others aren't around. It was a fun time.","Harpers Ferry, WV

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545798,"Sorry if this post seems somewhat disjointed. There was a lot of information to put in and I've been working on it sporadically over the last week. Since my last post, I passed from Pennsylvania into New Jersey then into New York today. That makes 8 states down. The rocks of Pennsylvania definitely picked up. Apparently there were more in the northern portion of state. Our hike out of Port Clinton was one of our most strenuous climbs. Not only was the climb completely in the sun but there were several sections of rock boulders you had to scramble over. It was kind of fun but challenging. It's one of the first times that I had to put my trekking polls away to make the climb easier. I've had to do that a couple times since then. Every now and then you get a section with large boulders that involve climbing and hopping over but usually the ground is relatively flat with the rocks jutting out. I was hoping the rocks would end in Pennsylvania but I was clearly under some delusions because New Jersey had just as many rocks towards the beginning but got a little better towards the end. The section of New Jersey into New York got intense. There were significant rock climbs including one section with metal rungs to climb like a ladder. It didn't help that another heat wave went through. My group has been debating if we want to go into New York City for a day or not. We're thinking if we go we want to get there in the morning and leave in the evening since staying in the town would be pretty expensive. It would be a fun if it fit into our schedule and didn't put us too off track. It would also be nice to take showers and do laundry before we go, then maybe we wouldn't be confused with homeless people. Ramblr and I were discussing how when we walk around town, people who don't know how to identify hikers probably confuse us as homeless people. Often times we smell, we're smeared with dirt, and we have snags and holes in our clothes. What people don't typically notice is that the things we have on are probably more expensive than the average person's clothes. Hiking attire isn't cheap. We're usually wearing wool socks and shirts, down jackets, hiking pants, and camp shoes (those vary on their expensiveness). Most hikers can easily identify other hikers but not all non-hikers can. With the rocks and the heat there have been a lot more snake sightings. Slug almost stepped on a rattlesnake once and I saw a 5 foot black snake chilling on a log...maybe sunning itself is a more appropriate term for what it was doing. My favorite snake was the one in the shelter built in 1937. Ramblr and I stopped at the shelter to check it out and take a break. He got there before I did and recounted the story of how he sat in the shelter and started reading the trail log when it mentioned the snake that lives in the shelter. He started looking around, looked up, and there was a several foot long black snake that lives in the rafters. I guess it comes out at night to eat mice. It's non-venomous, so people pretty much just leave it alone. It would definitely be unnerving to sleep in a shelter with that. Ramblr saw it and freaked out since he was unknowingly sitting right under it. I wonder how many other shelters have snakes living in them...When we arrived at Wind Gap, PA, Ramblr got there ahead of time and secured us a room at the Travel Inn. The room was nice enough but it was a single bed and there was no door to the bathroom. It was kind of bizarre but we made the bathroom situation work. If someone was in there you just make sure you didn't walk around the corner. I've never seen that before. Ramblr volunteered to sleep on the floor so Slug and I will owe him for the next time a similar situations comes around.Slug has become the first poison ivy victim in our group. Right before Wind Gap we passed through and overgrown field and we think he got brushed by poison ivy then because he got it on the side of his neck, near his collar, and his elbow. Ramblr and I don't think we're allergic to it because we've never come down with it before, as of this moment. I've never decided to test the theory that I'm not allergic. Luckily since we we're in a town when it broke out Slug was able to buy cream to treat the rash. It's finally starting to look better after a week or two. The day in Wind Gap was really nice. The town people were very friendly and we had no trouble getting rides when we needed them. The town even had a movie theater that was only showing one movie, but it was the one we wanted to see, Suicide Squad. Afterwards we decided to go to the local sports bar for food and drinks. As we were sitting there, Ramblr looked over and said, ""isn't that Tranquility?"" I looked over and sure enough, Tranquility and Sticks (the guy she's hiking with) were on the other side of the bar! She looked over and noticed me too and then we ran and gave eachother a hug. We are both pretty excited to have found each other again and to have another female around. They moved over to join us and we were able to catch up a little bit but they were planning on hiking out that evening. They didn't plan on hiking far though.We hiked from Wind Gap to Delaware Water Gap where there is a church hostel. Tranquility also stayed the night here. A couple people in her group attempted to hike all of New Jersey in one day, which is 70 miles. Tranquility did not want to attempt this so she hiked out of Delaware Water Gap while her group took a zero before and after this attempt. They ended up hiking for about 23 hours and made it 60 miles...which is incredible. Tranquility has been around since we reconnected and we've had a couple days where we hiked together so we could talk and catch up. We have decided that Pennsylvania and New Jersey have had the best trail magic so far. Its not that people have left food or been grilling hot dogs or anything, but a lot of water sources have been dry and people have made a point of leaving water jugs at road crossings for hikers to stay hydrated. You can't rely on this but it's nice to see if you're unsure if the next water source is dry or not. In addition to this, getting rides has been really easy. It's always nice when you get picked up quickly and don't think you're going to have to walk several miles to the town you need to get to. Nobody wants to walk extra miles that aren't on the actual trail. We did wake up this morning to a couple who packed out bagels and orange juice to our shelter (it wasn't far from the road). It's the first time that has happened and was an excellent surprise. We've passed by a couple of bee hives recently. One of them had a note to warn the northbound hikers. I was following a group of hikers earlier today and passed under a tree when suddenly I felt intense pain in both my arms. I vaguely saw the bug on me and did the bee run (where you run away waving your arms). Thankfully I'm not allergic but I waited near that location for Slug to catch up since he is. I also put up notes on both sides of the bee hive area to warn other hikers of the angry bees. I haven't been stung in a long time. It feels like my arm has a bruise where the sting location is.We've seen a lot more southbound hikers recently. It's fun to see new faces and have more people around but it's unfortunate that you know you'll never see them again, if you meet someone awesome. We get tips on upcoming sections from the people coming south. Sometimes this is a good thing and you learn about cool places to stop, and sometimes it's annoying. It depends on how much information they provide. We're not going to remember 20 places a southbounder really liked. Overall though, it's been pleasant meeting new people and reading the new entries in the log books.","Port Clinton, PA

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546896,"I'm officially in the New England area! We left New York on Sunday afternoon, I've hiked through Connecticut, and arrived in Massachusetts this evening. We decided not to go into New York City due to time constraints and the cost of it. New York was definitely not the easiest of states when it came to getting off trail. Not only is hitchhiking illegal, hardly anyone will stop for you anyways! The few who did give us rides said people in New York aren't very trusting. We had to rely on Uber for a couple of rides. It's the first time we've had to pay for a ride during our hike. I will say the trail magic was good in New York though. We've come across coolers with cold sodas and one morning were awoken to a couple bringing us bagels and orange juice at the shelter (we were about 0.5 miles from the road). It was a wonderful surprise. We also stayed at a state park and there was a guy who posted signs that he would make dinner and breakfast for hikers. We got in too late to make it for dinner but the breakfast was amazing. I think he just really likes talking with hikers about the journey and helping us out. We appreciate the admiration and effort to help us. We haven't been moving quite as quickly as I thought we would. I think my group agrees that we'll need to bank some mileage before we hit the White Mountains in New Hampshire. The days were really hot for a while but there have been a couple of cold fronts that have come in lately. We hope this will speed us up. It certainly makes hiking more pleasant. Locals have a habit of telling us we're ""behind."" We might not be in the main bubble of hikers but we're still on schedule to summit Katahdin by mid-October if we don't do too many low mileage days. It will be tough but definitely obtainable. Typically my group hikes for about 10 hours a day, which includes breaks. This also doesn't include the time for setting up and breaking down camp everyday so the tiredness is endless. I'm also tired of eating the same food every day which is causing me to not eat as much, which makes me tired and limits my energy. There aren't as many outfitters to pick up meals like Mountain House, which always made for a great meal at the end of the day. I'll get by, I just need to find some different foods to eat. The terrain has improved recently. There are very few jutting rocks and just the occasional boulder scramble. I think those are fun. There was one section of rocks called the Lemon Squeezer which basically was a crack in the rocks you had to walk through. I tried to do it with my pack on but ultimately had to take it off and carry it. Right after that section there was a boulder you had to go over which was extremely challenging considering it's going to hurt if you fall. It had a blue-blaze trail adjacent to it that said ""easy way,"" but we don't do the easy way! There has been beautiful scenery recently as well. We've seen beautiful lakes and rivers and the mountains are starting to look more bold again. We recently passed by the lowest point on the AT, which is by the bear cage at a zoo. The trail goes through a zoo! How cool is that?! We're going to be hiking back into higher elevation mountains soon, based on our guide books. I know it will be challenging but I look forward to it. The gnats that pestered us for so long gave way to mosquitoes over the last week or two. I think I'd take the gnats. Although they both bite, the gnats couldn't bite me through my long sleeves and pants but the mosquitoes can. There were days that the mosquitoes were so bad no one in my group wanted to take breaks while hiking because they would swarm you. Although we made good time for hiking on those days, it takes a toll on your body and mind. Makes you more tired and/or in pain (depending on the person). We're hoping the weather stays just cold enough that the mosquitoes go away. Speaking of the cold, we're preparing ourselves for the cold weather of New Hampshire and Maine while hoping it doesn't get so cold it snows. In Massachusetts, it appears we will start heading towards higher elevations, thus, colder weather. Ramblr and I washed our down sleeping bags and my down jacket in Kent, CT to restore the loft and warmth of the bags. Down can get flattened out and useless as it collects oil and grime. My sleeping bag probably wasn't terrible yet (I got a liner eventually to keep my body off of it) but my down jacket has been worn since the beginning of the trip near campfires, while hiking, and over sweaty clothes at the end of the day. It was gross and not holding warmth very well. Washing down is a huge pain. You have to use a special detergent (which we were able to purchase at an outfitter in town) and a front loading washing machine. After washing the down it typically clumps up and doesn't dry all the way because of it. We had to run 3 cycles of drying the down while taking breaks in between to break up the clumps of wet down. It really tested my patience. Even after those cycles of drying it wasn't completely dry, but close enough. I'm trying to take breaks with sunny locations to finish the drying process. I'm glad I won't have to do this again during the trip. The loft of our bags and my jacket prove our efforts were worth it at least. Now we just have to hope we don't get snow at high elevations. We would be terribly prepared for that but it's a possibility. One of the benefits of hiking a little later in the season is that we are going to catch the changing of the leaves in the fall. Ramblr has never seen this. I'm really looking forward to it. Over the course of the trail, I feel I've seen winter turn into the flowers of spring, then the greenery of summer, and now we'll see the changing colors of the leaves. It's exciting since fall is my favorite season, but there's not much of it to experience in Florida.","Wildcat Shelter

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547274,"I've dyed my hair twice since I've been on this hiking endeavor. The first time was when my parents were here and I had the luxury of a hotel room. This most recent time was at the Community Center in Great Barrington, MA. I had my parents send me the hair dye supplies I had prepared prior to the trip. The community center in town allowed free camping for hikers and use of the facilities (i.e. showers, pool, sauna) for $5. Since my group is saving money, I decided I could dye my hair in the bathroom of the center instead of getting a hotel. I got quite a few strange looks from people coming into the locker room. I felt like someone from the movies who commits a crime and has to dye their hair in the public bathroom to change their appearance. I hid in one of the shower stalls while the dye was setting. It all worked out and now I'll look great for my Mt. Katahdin picture! After the hair dying we went out to eat at the local brewery and then headed to the bowling alley. I've been wanting to go but I bowled terribly! At least I beat the guys. Town was enjoyable and we took another inadvertent zero (basically). Although we didn't stay in town, we hiked out late the following day and only did 2 miles. We took so long in town because we enjoyed many of the local activities. We went to a local donut shop in the morning and spent an excessive amount of time deciding which donuts to get...they all looked so good! After breakfast we resupplied then took advantage of the community center facilities. We went swimming and sat in the sauna. Apparently Ramblr and Slug's sauna trip was cut short by a naked fellow showing up and basically sitting on Slug's feet. Ramblr predicted it was 20 miles out of town to the Upper Goose Pond Cabin, where we currently are. We intended to push on to there. Well, after hiking several miles and taking a break the following day, Ramblr realized that it was actually 28 miles from town so we wouldn't be there that day, but the following day. By the time we finished that day in a slow hiking pace fashion with multiple long breaks, we had 14 miles to hike to get to the cabin. We all woke up fairly early so we could get to the cabin in the afternoon. Upper Goose Pond Cabin is a very unique trail encounter. They have canoes you can borrow to row on the pond, you can go swimming from a beach area, and there are bunks in the cabin for hikers. There is also a caretaker at the cabin who makes pancakes in the mornings. I packed out chocolate chips from town just for this purpose and the caretaker said she will gladly put them in the pancakes.Slug got to the cabin around 2 and Ramblr and I arrived around 3. I tried to talk the guys into going out on a canoe with me but I was unsuccessful. Slug did help me pull the canoe out to the water and the guys went swimming while I rowed out to the small island in the pond and back. It was an enjoyable trip. It was really strange to get to our hiking destination so early in the day. We're so used to getting in late, eating dinner, and going to bed that it kept feeling later than it actually was. We actually had time to do all our canoeing and swimming activities then relax at the cabin before bed. I even had time to write this blog entry! Maybe we will start hiking earlier...time will tell.","Massachusetts

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548341,"Another state down! I'm now in Vermont and the weather is starting to get cold. It's great during the day but the evenings and mornings can be overly chilly. I'm going to get my cold weather clothes back before I enter the White Mountains, where I know it'll be cold. Still, I'm enjoying the lack of blazing heat and my group has been able to do so good mileage days because of it.The beginning of Vermont marks the start of The Long Trail. The trail runs as a part of the AT for a while, then branches off. We've gotten at meet a lot more new people because of that trail. Some people who aren't hiking the Appalachian are still going north with us, so we're able to see them a couple of times, on occasion, unlike the southbound hikers who we only see once. I love meeting new hikers.Prior to entering Vermont, from Upper Goose Pond we hiked 21 miles into Dalton, MA and stayed at Tom's house. He's a trail angel who has been letting hikers stay on his property for many years. He's mentioned in AWOL's book. He has bikes on his property that hikers can use to get around town. The morning after staying the night, Tom even brought us out coffee, donuts, and fruit! I'm addition to that, Tom offered to drive us to the adjacent town's Dicks Sporting Goods so Ramblr could get new inserts for his shoes. Conveniently there was a Panera Bread (my favorite!) next door so we ate there for lunch and Ramblr bought Tom's meal. We got back on the trail pretty late that day but it was worth it for all the hospitality. We decided it was one of the most memorable places we've been on the trail.Something that never seems to get old for me out here is random people asking about the hike or the trail. I think when we live in our normal societies, we forget that humans all used to live in the woods (without the fancy equipment we all have today). Typically I meet the people who have questions at overlooks where you can also drive your car to the top. Recently, a location like this was Graylock Mountain, the highest elevation in Massachusetts. I met a few people who questioned me about sleeping in the woods, what I did before this that I could take so much time off, and did I have people back home that worry about me. I tend to feel I'm safer in the woods. When I'm out here I hang my food so no bears will bother me and you don't have to worry about people stealing your things far into the woods. I assume there are very few people interested in taking another hiker's gear and packing it out for several days. In normal society it seems you have to be sceptical of the masses of people around you. Not all people are just interested in the parts of hiking that highlight their own fears. I've met many people genuinely interested in the journey of the hike and that's the best thing to talk about.We finally stayed in a hotel recently. It's been about a month since we stayed in a real hotel with a bathroom door and everything. The hotel was extremely hiker friendly and gave us a shuttle to and from the trailhead. In addition to that, they invited us to join them for grilled bratwurst, steak, corn on the cob, and veggies. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! It's by far the best meal we've had on the trail and it was all free. When we were called to eat, the hotel was doing our laundry. I had my usual shorts and sports bra outfit but Ramblr was washing all his clothes and ended up coming outside with a hotel sheet wrapped around him. The people at the hotel said usually people come out in the towels, but they liked the look. It was funny. We didn't take a zero in town even though the town was pretty nice. We've made an effort recently to hike a lot of miles in an effort to catch some of the people ahead of us.So far Vermont has been one, if not the, most beautiful state we've been in. Stratton Mountain marks the location where Benton Mackaye was inspired to propose the creation of the AT. It has a fire tower at the top and the views from it really are beautiful. I can see how someone could be inspired by it. We also have hiked the slopes around some ski resorts. The trail just goes right up the side of one of ski runs! That was interesting and makes me want to come back and ski that slope someday. At the top of one of the slopes, typically one of the lift runs during the day and takes hikers down the mountain and back up for free...until after Labor Day when the lift only runs on the weekends. We arrived 2 days after Labor Day during a weekday and I was extremely disappointed in our luck. I had been looking forward to it. We always seem to miss things by a day or two.A day before reaching Manchester Center for resupply and to pick up packages at the post office, I started to fall and caught myself with my trekking pole; however, this was too traumatic for my trekking pole and it snapped on the plastic part right below the metal. Luckily, Manchester Center had two outfitters, one of which was able to replace the tips. I was glad because hiking with one pole or one pole and a stick was not working for me. We did laundry and resupplied in town but by the time we went to leave it was dusk and we had been informed that this was a resort town, so not a lot of locals who are used to seeing hikers who need rides. We ended up having to call a taxi service who made up their own prices. We didn't have many options so we had to pay it to get back to the trail but $20 is not a reasonable price to drive 5 miles up the road.At some towns on the trail there are hostels run by the Twelve Spiritual Tribes. We stayed at one of their hostels recently. I have been sceptical of staying their for a while but we've heard from many other hikers that the hostel is awesome and the people who run it are super friendly. It seems to be a general trend that people end up staying way longer than they intended. We only stayed one night, on Friday, when they have their big celebration. We got a full free dinner. They have dancing afterwards but we didn't hang around for that. In the morning they also have a free hiker breakfast, which was amazing. Overall it was one of my favorite hostel stays and we intend to stay at the one in the White Mountains. I'm glad I put my concerns aside and checked it out. I think the reason it's so inviting is because they want you to have a good time while you're there and it's all donation based. You can choose to work for stay, make a donation, or give nothing if you can't afford it. They just want you stop in.","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549227,"I'm currently in the White Mountains and reception has not been good, so I haven't been able to post my blog. I just keep adding to it hoping I'll get good reception at some point. I will post pictures when I'm able to. I entered New Hampshire last week and so far I think it is the best state, for multiple reasons. The views have been beautiful. We're finally seeing landscapes with mountains as far as the eye can see, which we haven't seen since late Tennessee/North Carolina and early Virginia. I also have my friends, Jeff and Andrea, who live near Hanover, New Hampshire. Ramblr, Slug, and I were able to stay with them a couple of days while they helped us slack pack (slack packing involves leaving most of your gear behind so you can hike with just the essentials for the day).We left Rutland around 1pm and set up a time and place for Jeff to pick us up in case we didn't have service. Jeff and Andrea didn't have to work on the Sunday after Jeff picked us up, so we decided it would be best to take our zero at their house that day so I could visit with them (and the guys wanted to watch football). The road we had selected to meet Jeff was a gravel road but we were basically guessing on the condition of the road and the location where the AT crossed it. We arrived at the road crossing around 8:30 pm and didn't have cell reception to update Jeff on our exact location. The road wasn't great but looked accessible enough for Jeff's truck to drive on. I started to get concerned about him finding us or the road being inaccessible around 9:15, but luckily he showed up shortly after. He had arrived early and was driving back and forth on the road and side roads in an attempt to locate us.On Sunday we took a zero and got to eat at The Skinny Pancake in town. The boys watched football most of the day while me and Andrea rested outside and I caught up with my journal. One exciting moment happened in the early morning hours. Slug and I were sleeping upstairs and I thought I felt something run across the bed but I was half asleep so I figured it was my imagination. Not much later Slug said ""what was that?"" and I said ""I don't know!"" We turned the light on and saw a cute rat scurrying about the room. I knew Andrea had some pet rats but I'd never seen them and wasn't sure it was hers. Slug realized the cage for the rats was cracked. I had never seen the rats and didn't want to catch some random rat and put it in the cage so I woke up Andrea to verify one of hers escaped. She confirmed and tried to catch Lilly (the escaped rat) but was having trouble. We thought she might end up being out all night so Slug went downstairs to inform Ramblr that if a rat ran on him, don't kill it. His eyes got really wide and he said he couldn't make any promises. It was an excitable start to the day but we all managed to get a little more sleep after it.The two days after the zero, Jeff drove us to the trail we hadn't done before Hanover the first day, then after Hanover on the second day. We were able slack pack 23 and 19 miles, respectively, since we were slack packing. 23 miles is the longest day we've done so far. It helped having the lighter pack and a house to go back to in the evenings. This also helped me to spend more time with Jeff and Andrea since we never would have had the time to take multiple days off..they also would have been at work during the weekdays.The day we left Jeff and Andrea's house we had to acclimate back to wearing the weight of a full pack. Ramblr had a bad day that day, but not because of the pack. At the top of a mountain he used the privy and halfway through felt something crawling on him. He felt for what it was and discovered multiple ticks crawling on him (we later decided that maybe they weren't ticks). He brushed them off and looked down at the toilet seat where he observed small bugs crawling on and around the toilet. He was freaking out over that encounter, I would have freaked out more. Shortly after the ""tick"" incident, Ramblr was walking over a board which covered a section of mud and stepped off of it to the side. He managed to step into the deepest mud puddle we've encountered on the trail and sunk his leg into the mud up to his thigh. I remember passing that mud puddle and sticking my trekking pole into it thinking ""wow, that's a really deep puddle. It would suck to fall into it."" When he met up with me later in the day I played him the song Bad Day to lift his spirits. In the afternoon Slug was contacted by a friend offering to pick us up and let us stay in a house. Ramblr was extremely excited about this after his terrible day. She picked us up in the evening and sleeping in a bed was amazing, as usual.We have now officially entered the White Mountains and they are just as beautiful as I expected. We were luckily enough to have beautiful weather on our first two days here and got amazing views from the first two mountains in the Whites. The trail also crossed two roads where you can get to the town of Lincoln, NH, so with the help of Miss Janet (a well know trail angel that loves hikers), we were able to slack pack one of the mountains and gain some ground on people. I've been seeing hikers that I haven't seen in months! I even found out that we have now passed Lil Griz, who was the fourth member of our group for a while. I'm not sure how or when we passed him. He's been ahead of us since Harpers Ferry. Some of our time in the Whites has been in clouds with no views, which is what I expected initially. I'm just glad I've had some good days to see mountains for miles. The climbs have been difficult and we've had to go slower but the rewards of the views is worth it.We've had three huts in the Whites that we did work-for-stay. It's basically a lodge with bunks, bathrooms, a kitchen, and a staff that makes meals for you where people can pay to stay. It's expensive though so most thru-hikers wouldn't pay to spend the night there. The huts offer several work-for-stay spots on a first come, first serve basis for hikers. We've also decided that they'll give you a spot if you come in late and they feel bad for you. They give you some chores to do and let you eat the leftover dinner and/or breakfast that the paying patrons didn't finish. One hut didn't offer this to us, which was disappointing because we were hauling logs and walking down the trail as our work-for-stay. It was the least friendly hut staff we've met.I'm going to give special mention to Mount Washington as it was the most unique and challenging mountain hiking we've done. Both up to the summit and down from it. Most of the hike was above the tree line and I got wind and sun burned. On the summit and my hike down the mountain I wore my buff over my face to shield myself from the wind. We did summit the mountain on an amazing day. The clouds were minimal and the views were great. Mount Washington is the second highest peak on the AT. We started hiking down the mountain late in the day with 6 miles to get to a hut. We had to night hike and it was less than safe. There were rocks and 70+ mph gusting winds. With our packs on it was easy to get blown over and it made the hike challenging and slightly dangerous. They also don't have many blazes to mark the trai. You had to follow cairns, which were hard to see, and the trail signs were not very clear about which direction you should go. Can't wait to see what the reszt of the Whites will bring!","Rutland, VT

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550059,"The end of the Whites and the beginning of Maine have been tough. I also think of them as the rock slabs of pain. The descent down from Mount Washington was tough. There were large rocks you stepped down from one after another but the step was one or two feet each time so you constantly have to catch yourself with muscular energy then land and shock absorb with your knees. By the time we got to the road at the bottom my knees were hurting. We went into town that day and stayed the night, then took the next day of hiking off. I had to talk the guys into this. Having the break helped my knees a lot, although they still had some remnant pain.The last mountains of the Whites was the Wildcats. The climb was steep steps and towards the end of it there were large, steep slabs of rock that were quite slippery. This trend continued past the Whites into the beginning of Maine. I don't see how anyone could walk down the slabs of rock. Typically, everyone walks near the edge of the slab so they can grab trees and walk on roots for traction. Occasionally I attempt to walk down small slabs of rock, which typically results in me sliding and/or falling down the rock. I've gotten quite a few sizable bruises and scrapes in the last couple of weeks. The other day I somersaulted down some rocks. I'm glad my pack took most of the impact but I did hit my head on a rock and skinned off the top of one of my fingers. It could have been worse.The weather has had some dramatic cold snaps where the temperatures have gotten into the low 20s. When this happens we have to sleep with our water filters to keep them from freezing and cracking, which makes them ineffective at filtering out bacteria. After one really cold evening with whipping winds we decided to stay in the next town to escape the next night of cold, which was supposed to be just as bad. Ramblr and I also bought an emergency solar sack to help with the cold. Ramblr tried sleeping with it over his sleeping bag recently but it created a lot of condensation and got his sleeping bag wet...so I guess that doesn't work. He said he was warm for a few hours until that happened.The most challenging section of trail was Mahoosuc Notch. It is considered the most fun and most challenging mile of the AT. It did not disappoint and we did it the morning after it rained. It's basically a rock scramble where you have to climb over and under rock boulders. Typically we had to sit on the rocks to lower ourselves onto a rock below it. Sometimes we had to climb through rock caves and take our packs off, otherwise we wouldn't fit. Overall, it took about 2.5 hours to compete. As a means of comparison, typically we can hike a mile in 0.5 hours, sometimes faster. By the end of Mahoosuc Notch we were soaking wet from crawling on the rocks. There is a campground near the edge of it and a group of hikers had started a fire, so we spent some time warming/drying ourselves. It was worth it. There are still really steep sections of trail but at least it's not as technical.We had good luck with a trail angel recently. When we were in Golrham, Ramblr stopped to talk to a guy who lived in Andover (the next town we were resupplying in). He gave us his number and said the hitchhiking there could be difficult and if we needed anything to give him a call. When we got to the Andover road crossing it was not a popular. As Ramblr and I waited for Slug, a guy pulled over and said he'd wait with us until Slug arrived so he could take us into town. By the time we resupplied and ate dinner it was dark out so we called up the connection we made in Gorham and he offered to pick us up. When he arrived we chatted for a little while then he offered to let us stay at an apartment complex he rents. He said the tenants moved out recently so we could sleep in the building and get showers then he would drive us to the trail in the morning. We ended up getting breakfast with him in the morning, then he took us back to the trail.We have set our summit date for Mt. Katahdin on October 15th. My parents are joining us for the summit and Slug has some friends meeting him. We all have booked our plane tickets for several days after the 15th. With this in mind, we are slightly behind schedule due to the difficult terrain. We have to average 18 miles a day with the hopes of getting to the 100-mile wilderness on the 9th. We've decided we'll just have to wake up early and hike until dark if needed. Luckily, the terrain is going to get flatter coming up. We're hoping to make up miles there but we are getting worn down. We also have resigned to the fact that we won't be able to stop into towns for showers and laundry since that takes too long. It will be a smelly couple of weeks.","Madison Spring Hut in the White Mountains
","Stratton, ME","Oct 04, Tue",13.50
Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550721,"In Stratton, we reconnected with a group of about 8 people who call themselves the Fire Squad. Most groups out here assign themselves some sort of name. My group is White Blazed and Confused. Ramblr mentioned the name once and we stuck with it, even though we don't often introduce ourselves by the name. While at dinner Fire Squad mentioned that one of their members, Shaggy, has his parents in town and they were going to slack pack. They said they would check with Shaggy to see if we could slack pack with them. With two major mountain ranges left and the time frame we needed to keep, we were pleased to have this opportunity. We can move fast without a full pack.We slack packed over the Bigalows into the night and were surprised to find Miss Janet waiting at the road crossing where we ended. She drove us to town and the plan was to stay in Caratunk then walk southbound the following day so we could catch the Kennebec River Ferry. The Kennebec River is the widest river hikers need to ford. The current is swift and there is a dam upstream which can raise the water level of the river rapidly. It's dangerous to ford so the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) provides a canoe ferry service at specific times to help hikers cross the river. By the time of year we crossed, the ferry only ran from 9-11am and it's right before the town of Caratunk, ME. By hiking southbound we were able to cross the river in the morning then continue to the road crossing we last left. The road we were being picked up on was 17 trail miles from Caratunk but was a 1 hour and 40 minute drive by road. Shaggy's parents drove a Toyota 4-Runner and we decided we didn't want to make multiple trips so we would attempt to fit 13 people and a dog into the vehicle. We succeeded in fitting everyone but it was cramped and many people lost feelings in their limbs at some point in the trip. It was an adventure. We wanted to get a picture of it but nobody could move enough to do that and everyone wouldn't fit into the picture anyways.After the big days of slack packing we decided to stay in town and take a nero (which ultimately turned into a zero). The bar in town had a hot tub and it was a lot of fun hanging out with all the other hikers. They had rented a cabin in town so we stayed there with them. After this last day of rest, we had one more day of slack packing with The Fire Squad before going our separate ways. We had a strict schedule to keep by this point with distances to travel each day which were at the maximum amount of our capabilities.We hiked to Monson, ME for our last resupply and stayed in town. In the morning Slug ordered the 100-miler breakfast, which ended up being a challenge meal (there are a few of those on the trail). He had an hour to eat 3 large pancakes, 3 eggs, 3 sausage links, 2 pieces of toast, grits, coffee, and orange juice. He finished in 30 minutes and got his picture taken for the wall of the restaurant. We started our journey into the 100 mile wilderness that day with the requirement of averaging 20 mile days to make it to Mt. Katahdin by October 15th. We were meeting my parents and Slug's friends for the summit of Katahdin so we needed to be there by that specific date. We also all had purchased our plane tickets for a day or two after that.Our first day into the 100 mile wilderness was cut short upon meeting Scout, a trail angel doing trail magic from his cabin close to the trail. We only stopped a mile from our intended destination, so we didn't lose too much time. He made us food and gave us drinks, despite us arriving after dark. It was amazing. We camped at his house and he made us pancakes, sausage, and coffee in the morning. It was a pleasant, unexpected surpassed and we continued on with our journey shortly after that.The 100 mile wilderness has a few notable mountains but a lot of it is relatively flat as well. We were able to make good time and the views are gorgeous. The leaves are in full color change and there are a lot of lakes. Our most taxing day was October 13th, the day before my parents would be picking us up. We hiked 27 miles split up by a 3-hour nap in a shelter while it was raining. We hiked to the next shelter until about 2am. It was awful and we were delirious and exhausted by the time we arrived. We slept for 4 hours and a cold front seemed to have come in after the rain because it was ridiculously cold during the night. We finished hiking to Baxter State Park where my parents met us with donuts and sandwiches. They took us to Millinocket, ME to stay at a hotel with them where we got showers and did laundry. Slug met his friends later in the evening at the hotel.We left the hotel early so we could arrive at Baxter State Park around 6am. My parents and Slug's friends reserved parking but you have to be there before 7am or they will give your spot away. We started hiking by 8am. The initial couple of miles were relatively easy but then it started to get rockier. There were large boulders to scramble over and between. The hike took a while after we got to the boulder section. Around 3 miles in Slug's friends had to turn back due to time constraints. It gets dark around 6:15 in Maine. It was a challenging hike. We saw a few day hikers who had to turn back.Arriving at the Katahdin sign was exciting but felt surreal. It's difficult to feel like it's over when you still have to hike down the mountain. We took our photos and tried not to stay at the summit for too long because it was getting late and we didn't all have headlamps. We went down the mountain a different way than we went up. It was not exactly easier though. Slug and Ramblr hiked quickly to get to the base of the mountain before dark. Ramblr gave me his headlamp so I could assist my parents after it got dark. My mom hiked fairly quickly and grouped up with a family with kids who had headlamps. I stayed around my dad and it did get dark before we got off the trail.So now, the hike is over after about 6.5 months of hiking, 2189.1 miles walked, 5 million steps, I'm finished. I'm still acclimating back to the ""real world."" Everything is loud and there are people everywhere at the places I've been. We all drove to Boston and celebrated our finish at the oldest tavern in America. Slug flew out on the 17th and Ramblr and I flew out on the 18th. We slept in the airport the night before our flight since the flights were early. We got some strange looks but nobody tried to stop us. It was relatively comfortable since we had our air pads and such to sleep on. It was sad parting ways with my trail family. I'm going to miss them but we have plans to get together soon.I will create a fishing thoughts post once I have time. I have been busy trying to update my personal journal and clean my gear...and rest. Rest is important.","Stratton, ME

Luigi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552634,"I still remember my first day on the trail. Walking through that archway in Amicalola Falls State Park was surreal as all my planning and dreaming was coming to fruition. As I climbed the approximately 600 stairs in the first mile I wondered how I would fair in the months to come but knew I would get stronger. I arrived at the top of Springer Mountain after 8.5 miles barely able to lift one of my legs and thinking I might have pulled something. The sunset that evening was one of the most beautiful I saw on the trail, but perhaps that's because it was the first. I met some amazing people in my first night and got a taste of the community of the trail. Some of these people ended up getting off trail, some I hiked with for a while, and some I never saw again but heard they were way ahead.I've walked through the changing of the seasons. The land went from barren and leafless trees, to the first blooms of spring, to the lush greens of summer, to the changing of the leaves in the fall. Being a part of the environment allowed me to see the pros and cons of each season. Without the leaves on the trees or bushes you have no cover from the sun or prying eyes when you go into the woods for a bathroom break. The summer was warm and green but with that comes rain storms and biting bugs. I got caught on a ridge in more than one thunderstorm. There were also record rains this year and I spent many days hiking in soaking wet clothes and shoes. The fall brought back the cold weather, sometimes in the low 20s. The weather is great for the day but can be chilly sleeping at night. Thankfully the cold weather took away the biting bugs.I hiked with a variety of people over the 6.5 months I was on trail. I was a member of several different hiking groups in the beginning, each one disbanding for different reasons. Sometimes your hiking styles or personalities just don't work, sometimes you just prefer to hike alone, and sometimes things come up where the group disbands. Ultimately, I ended up meeting my trail family slightly before and in Damascus, about 500 miles into the trip. I was sporadically and more regularly hiking with Lil Grizz and Ramblr right before Damascus but we didn't become a true unit and start planning our days together until after that. In Damascus we added Slug to our group, an excellent addition! I had the most spectacular birthday in Damascus. I turned 30 on the trail I dreamed about, in a great trail town, and with many of the hikers I met but hadn't seen in a while since they took zero days here. We stayed at Woodchuck's hostel and I'd definitely recommended it to anyone. These hostel owners really love what they do. Woodchuck would challenge hikers to games of cornhole with the possibility of winning a free stay.Once I had my 4 person trail family we opted to stay at hotels rather than hostels due to the cost efficiency and privacy. I think if I hiked again I'd want to try out more hostels. They're all so unique! Some maybe aren't as great but it's all a part of the experience. Even if we didn't stay, sometimes we stopped by to eat something or check the place out. After living in the woods, it's amazing how your hotel standards lower too. Some had spiders, they were questionably clean, and one hotel even didn't have a door on the bathroom (we made it work but pooping was awkward). They were cheap though and that's what counts when you're running on savings.The trail really restores your faith in humanity as well. Random strangers would set up and wait for hikers all day just to give us food and help us out. People would pick up us hikers to take us to town when we obviously were smelly and dirty. A few people gave us money...usually they gave that to Ramblr. He also was given an extra case of Monster Energy drinks. He is our schmoozer! Getting to towns would have been impractical without the help of strangers. I look forward to doing my own trail magic for hikers and encourage others to do the same. The smallest acts can make the biggest difference.I have to thank all the friends and family who sent me items in the mail. Usually some food and coffee...never could go without coffee. My friends Jeff and Andrea live in NH and helped us slack pack then would let us stay at their house. It was one of the highlights of our trip. My group covered more miles than possible and got to see my friends. Later on the trail we got help from the Fire Squad and Shaggy's parents. We wouldn't have made it to Maine by our deadline if not for their help with slack packing. I'll never forget fitting 13 people and a dog into a Toyota 4-Runner and driving for 1 hrs and 45 minutes. It's a once in a lifetime thing and wasn't particularly fun or conformable, but necessary (and slightly amusing to see).I won't miss the trail food. Anything that requires just adding water or peanut butter is out. Somehow Slug still likes peanut butter and I'll never understand it. Sometimes people will offer me granola bars or trail mix (mom). I usually respond with ""that's a joke, right?"" They laugh. When I decide to hike my next long trail I'll eat these things again. I'll think about eating peanut butter, the other things, not so much.I think the hardest part of leaving the trail was parting with my trail family. We lost Lil Grizz around the halfway point but Slug and Ramblr were with me for almost 1700 miles. We saw each other daily and basically lived together in our traveling homes. Slug left for home first and after sleeping in the airport I parted with Ramblr. Luckily we don't all live too far apart. Ramblr and a few other hikers are only a few hours away but Slug lives 8 hours away. I've seen him a couple times but I wish we were all closer.Now that I'm back, I've stayed in touch with some of my hiking friends and my trail family. I've been applying for geology jobs in SC but haven't heard back from any place I've sent my application (any suggestions?). Currently I'm staying with my parents but I look forward to getting my own place and starting back with a normal routine and regular income. I've at least been enjoying the freedom of not HAVING to be somewhere daily for work. I write reports freelance for my former employer at the moment. Adjusting back hasn't been super easy. I miss the trail all the time. I tell people I'd keep hiking if I had unlimited funds. I've tried to stay active. I run and lift weights to stay in shape and it's working for me.I hope all those reading this who have considered hiking the trail go and do it. It's difficult but amazing and worth it! My next adventure will be the PCT but I'll give it some time before I attempt it. I've started reading books on it! I'm forever hooked on long distance hiking.",,The Completed Trail,"Dec 26, Mon",0
