Popeye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518500,"Hiking the Appalachain Trail has been on my bucket list for a long time. Last year I met two people that were cycling on Catrikes across the United States. The woman had two brain traumas and almost died. The man had a stroke and was told he would never talk or walk. They so inspired me that I retired and decided to actually hike the Trail. My start date is March 21, 2016 at Springer Mountain. All my kids and grandkids will be there to see me off. I can't wait to get started.",,Inspiration,"Dec 15, Tue",0
Popeye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518499,"Last week started to seriously train for my hike on the AT. I have been doing one or two hikes each week along with trail maintenance on Wednesdays. Last week I hiked 7 miles in Ocala National Forest, 14 miles in Wekiva State Park and 18 on the West Orange Trail. Tired feet but felt good.",,Training hike,"Dec 18, Fri",0
Popeye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518501,I have all my gear assembled. Pack weight is 21# without water and food.

Popeye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519170,A couple of good training hikes so far this year. Saturday did 8 miles in Withlachooee State Forest. Some good hills.

Will overnight at Springer Mountain Shelter and hike back on the 26th. Want to check out my conditioning and my winter gear. Glad to have company if you want to join me.,,Training hikes,"Jan 05, Tue",0
Popeye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519999,Time is flying by and I can't believe it is just two months till I start my AT thru hike. Getting in lots of training. Hiked 3 days this week and will run a 5.2K on Saturday. Then next week will hike at Springer and the a couple of days in North Florida before stopping in Tallahasse to visit my 6 week 3 month old grandson. And I turn 66 on January 31.,,View Entry,"Jan 21, Thu",0
Popeye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520397,"Finished my hike from Amicola Falls to Springer Mountain shelter. 28 degrees when I started, a lot of snow and ice on the trail. Also a lot of trees down from the storm. Met a nice family while hiking so had company overnight. Still icy on return hike. I found out a couple of things. First, I need to do a lot more squats to help me in the climbs. Second, I will be getting a better sleep pad. I like to lay on my side and hips need more padding. The rest of my gear worked fine and I was plenty warm. I did not wear my puffy hiking but it was nice to put on at night. I will also try to lose some weight from my pack.Can't wait till I actually start my hike in March.",,Springer Mountain hike,"Jan 29, Fri",0
Popeye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521329,Less than 5 weeks till I start my hike in Georgia. Time is really flying by. Hard to find much elevation here in Central Florida but we do have but we do have Sugarloaf Mountain in Clermont- a whopping 200 feet of elevation. I have started going once a week and just walk up and down. This week 6 reps. I will keep adding more but pretty boring. Plan to do a couple of 3-5 days trips also in Ocala National Forest. I have got my mail drops planned out - trying to minimize as much as possible. Plan to buy most of my food on the trail - too many stories of hikers getting tired of the food they prebought.,,Training,"Feb 17, Wed",0
Popeye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523202,"Only 10 days till I am Springer to start my hike. I went to the ATKO at Amicalola Falls State Park last weekend. Lots of good information was dispensed by former thru hikers. Gene Espy (the second person to thru hike the AT) was there and gave a nice talk on his experience. Also a good panel discussion with 6 hostel owners. If you plan on hiking next year, I highly recommend going to either the AT Gathering in October or the ATKO. The information you can get is invaluable. One thing that everyone at ATKO emphasized was to realize when you go to a hostel or town, you are a visitor. Please remember that you represent all the hikers that will come after you.There is a trail runner based at Amicalola Falls to check you in and also to check your pack. She does a good job of letting hikers know what they don't need to pack.I am getting a little excited and nervous. Excited to get started and nervous wondering if I have prepared enough.",,Getting Excited,"Mar 10, Thu",0
Popeye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523658,"Kind of hard to think that this time next week I will be camping some place north of Springer Mountain. Here in Oralndo it was 85 today. Goning to be nice to hike in cold weather for a change. Have packed and repacked, checked to see what I don't need to take, packing mail drops and getting more excited every day. If you start at Amicalola Falls, have clarity check your pack before you start.",,Final Prep,"Mar 15, Tue",0
Popeye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524254,"My journey finally begins. I will start today at road crossing just north of Springer Mountain.

Popeye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525090,"One week on the trail under my belt. Feeling a lot more confident that I can actually accomplish this. Started out in low 30s at Springer Mountain. Cold first night at Hawk Mountain shelter but stayed warm in my sleeping bag. Beautiful hiking this week. Got my first trail magic at Woody Gap. Hot dogs, sodas, Gatorade, cookies. Coming down to Unicoi Gap, I was dreaming of cheeseburgers. I was very tired and thought I might end my hike there and get a ride into Hiawassee. But as I got to the road, trail magic again! Cheeseburgers! Also chips, sodas and homemade cookies. I was overjoyed. I felt so good after that that I hiked another 5.7 miles and climbed two mountains. Today I am in Hiawassee and am taking a zero day tomorrow.","Springer Mountain

Popeye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525935,"One state down and thirteen to go. Nice to be out of the mountains in Geogia. NC seems not so steep except one short climb yesterday up Albert Mountain- 400' climb in about .1 mile. Very steep and hard climb up and over a lot of rocks. Still going strong. Hiked the last couple of days in either foggy drippy weather or rain. I did get to sleep Ina shelter last night so that was a relief. Staying Franklin tonight to dry out, clean up and resupply. AYCE free breakfast tomorrow at a church and then back on the trail.","Hiawassee

Popeye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526522,"Two weeks gone already. You kind of lose track of the days when you are on the trail. I have survived a couple of drippy rainy days a d one very cold night in the 20s. Spent one night in Franklin. A very nice trail town. Good shuttles from the trail. Also a great AYCE free pancake breakfast at the First Babtist Church that also had bacon, juice and coffee. Some hard long climbs this week. A very steep descent from Wesser Bsld down to the NOC. Lots of big rocks that I had to slide down. Sister was waiting at NOC when I got there. Had a nice lunch and then back to her home in Greenville, SC for a rest day.","Franklin, NC

Popeye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527394,"Three weeks gone and 166 miles. I am at Fontana Dam and will be in the Smokies today. Been an exciting week. Weather has been very cold most of the time, in the 30s most mornings. Had snow, sleet and rain. Met up with Erin, Chef Ducky and Twizzler again at Fontana. Also nice trail magic on Saturday at Fontana shelter. Ladies had sandwiches and drinks for us along with a goodie bag. Another couple were frying wings for us. Me Janet also showed up and shared her wisdom with us. It has been a great experience so far.","Springer Mountain

Popeye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529123,"One month into my hike. Made it through the Smokies and am now in Hot Springs, NC. Got here yesterday and am taking a zero day. There are forest fires on the trail going out of town so may not be able to leave tomorrow. I did get a new backpack from the outfitter in town because my old one was coming apart. I had beautiful weather through the Smokies. No rain, cool at night and warm in the day time. Wild flowers are starting to bloom and the trees are starting to leaf out. Sometimes when I am looking at a beautiful view(which is every day) I think how lucky I am to be seeing it. Such a small percent of the population will ever see what I see every day. It is an amazing journey. So far, no real problems. No foot or leg problems except for being sore after a long day hiking.","Maine

Popeye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530017,"I am at Uncle Johnny's Hostel in Erwin, TN today. 342 miles down, feeling pretty good about what I have accomplished so far. Yesterday I did my longest day so far - 15.7 miles and I felt pretty good. I slept alone the last 2 nights. I did slip off the trail yesterday and banged my knee. Pretty sore and stiff today but I only had 4 miles to hike to get into Erwin. I keep getting passed by faster hikers(usually young) but I keep seeing them again. Yesterday I got an early start and kept passing camp sites where everyone was still asleep. I am slow but steady.","Springer Mountain

Got my tent set up between the rain but then it rained pretty hard most of the night. Have taken a couple of short days to dry out and recuperate.

Popeye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535791,"It had been a while since I have posted anything about my progress. I have made it past the 700 mile mark. I was doing very well until about 10 days ago. I sprained my left ankle going down to Woods Hole Hostel. It was not to serious and I was able to continue hiking. However, I got a blister on my right foot. It got to the point it hurt every step. I had a very hard day going down from Dragon's Tooth to Four Pines Hostel. I decided to shuttle in to Daleville.I had a doctor look at my foot. He said I had a very serious infection in my big toe.I got a couple of shots and 2 Rd. He said no hiking for a few days. Decided to rehab with my daughter in Philly. I hope to be back on the trail Wednesday or Thursday.","Springer

Popeye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537173,I was able to visit my daughter in Philly while I healed. Got back on the trail last Thursday. Foot still a little but able to hike ok. I am actually getting some good miles in. Virginia is getting a little easier to hike. Climbs are not so severe and trail is usually pretty nice. I am now trying to get at least 15 miles a day. I am also increasing the amount of protein in my diet. Seems to be helping me on the climbs.I have passed the 800 Mile mark.,"Daleville, VA
