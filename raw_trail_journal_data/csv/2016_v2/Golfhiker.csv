Golfhiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531237,"I'm late to the game. I told anyone & everyone I was not doing a journal for my hike this year. Don't get me wrong, I read many journals, totally enjoy them, learn a lot, but I just wanted to keep things simple. Or maybe I was just being lazy. Well, here I am, about to begin my hike AND my journal. 
Hang in there with me, I have much to figure out, technically speaking.","

Golfhiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531301,"A very quick recap. I just retired this week after 41 years in the insurance world. I'm going to play a few rounds of golf, then leave for Springer on Monday, May 9, spending the day at the Hiker Hostel, and actually stepping off on Tuesday AM. Plan is to hike to Harper's Ferry, WVA, then head home for family stuff. I will return to hike the Northern half next Spring, thus my Thru in Two. 
If you read enough Journals you will see that they come in all varieties. Some are very humorous, some quite introspective, some have too much daily information, some not enough. Some are extremely well written and fun to read. Some, I give up on early. I have never done a journal, so I only hope I can find a nice rhythm of what to say, how to say it, to share, entertain, enlighten everyone about this epic adventure. Toss in a few pics, facts about myself, those I may hiking with, the ups and downs of trail life. 
I've been backpacking since 1980, with over 1000 AT miles ( some duplicates), mostly in the Southern Appalachians. I wanted to do this hike while I was still young enough and strong enough, so now is the time. 
And remember, when all is said & done, You Can't Not Try!","

Golfhiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531372,"6 days till Georgia, I have my gear in order, I'm feeling good, and ready to go. I'm really a pretty disciplined, orderly, organized, planning type, so this hike will truly test my ability to think & do on the fly. Of course that's what makes an AT hike so much fun, because plans rarely go as planned. 
Proper gear, everything you need & nothing you don't. I have ""unofficially"" weighed my entire kit, with 4 days of food & 1 ltr. of water @ 28 lbs. good but not great, and I don't think I'll exceed that unless I need to go beyond 4 days between resupplies. 
While gear is important I'm 100% sure the key is too be mentally strong. Not to go all Dr. Phil on things, but I'll share my philosophies & AT Principals as we progress.","

Golfhiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531609,"I have been a regular follower of TJ for a while, as many others have, so some of you will be familiar with what is often included. Often you read about extensive pre hike prep, gear choices, physical training, AT statistics, background stories of why, when, how.....   All good stuff.Since today is Friday & I'm leaving for Georgia on Monday, there is not enough time to do much pre hike discussion.    And for sure I can't begin to cover it all in detail, and so I won't.   Just know that I believe I wisely chose my gear, I'm in very good physical condition, and other than my recent retirement, I have not had a life changing experience ( which is often a reason for heading to the AT, and I get that), As for Q&A, I don't wish to assume everyone knows about Long distance backpacking or the AT, so perhaps we can put things out a bit at a time.    Today's question -   Are you going by yourself?    Pretty much, but while you may hike alone during each day, you see many hikers going your direction (NOBO - Northbound, which is Springer Mtn, Georgia to Mt. Katahdin, Maine)or SOBO - ( Southbound, the reverse).    I expect to meet fellow NOBOs on Springer to share the journey, so I won't be alone.   Gotta go.    Tee time just ahead!","

Golfhiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531782,"Getting closer to my start day.   All is ready, for me personally & at home, where I have hopefully done all the necessary things one must do when you plan to be away for 3 months.    Note- I could not do my hike without the love & support of family, mostly my wife Karen, who will do double duty at home while I'm away.   Not a small thing.   So today's question ( or the QoD- question of the day, as it will be known).   Why would anyone want to hike the AT?    Hikers have been going up or down the AT for years, as ""thru hikers"", ""section hikers"", weekenders or day hikers, so it's hardly a new idea.   Speaking for myself, a long distance hike is a wonderful combination of so many things.   It's very physically demanding, it's social, solitude, peaceful, spiritual, fun, mentally challenging, adventurous, miserable, simple, all of that & more.   In fact, I can say for certain that you will likely experience all of those things in one day.    It won't be long before the conceptual becomes reality.","

Golfhiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531927,"Today is the day before the day I start hiking North.    Nothing more to do.   As anyone who has ever planned an AT adventure will tell you, the pre hike, build up, preparation can be overwhelming, simply because there is so much unknown to plan for.   In my case, my hiking friends will confirm that I already had enough gear to support a hike in any weather, any time of year, anywhere. So why I have I spent the last 4 months micro-analyzing each & every piece of gear??   Truthfully, The planning has been great fun,   Gear is important, ounces add up, pounds can hurt you. In the end I just made my choices, using the mantra, ""everything you need, and nothing you don't"".   We shall see.   QoD-   How does one get to the trail?   Sub Q- what do you do with your car? Again, planning is key.   Today, Karen will drive me to Charlotte, NC. I'll take an Amtrack to Gainseville, Ga. I will be picked up by the good folks at the Hiker Hostel in Dalonega, Ga. I'll spend Monday at the Hostel, and Tuesday am, we will be shuttled up to Springer Mtn., sign the Register and begin hiking. No car in my case.   Did I mention the train leaves Charlotte at 2:15am?   Oh the sacrifices we make to do the things we like to do.    Now if all that sounded complicated, let me tell you how you get from your Manhattan hotel to the start of the NYC Marathon!   Another story, another day.","

Golfhiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532181,"Long train ride to Georgia.   It was actually the ""after midnight train to Georgia""!   Relaxing here in my first hostel, light dinner, good nights sleep, off to Soringer in the AM. BTW, I'm still working on my photos.   Sorry. QoD- what about animals (bears)?   Do you carry a weapon?   There are sure to be bears in these mountains but you really don't expect to see them. Take care of your food at night by hanging & you will be fine. You will however see plenty of shelter mice. Same treatment for your food. I don't own a gun, and while some may carry there is really no need, and it is illegal. The AT is part of the Nationsl Park System, thus no firearms. Heavy rain predicted tomorrow.   Yea buddy.","

Golfhiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533658,"Hey all. Let me first say that I'm sorry for such a delay in posting my first trail journal. Great intentions, but a few missteps caused me to not do a very good job. I have hiked for seven days, and took a day of rest in Hiawassee Georgia, 69.8 miles north from Springer Mountain. The weather has been fantastic, no bugs, cool temps, and most importantly, no rain while high and king. That is all soon to change. As often happens, people meet up early on the trail and form bonds and friendship and hike together for various periods along the trail, which has happened to me. I'm hiking with The Finn, Chin Music, Goat, November & an assortment of others.    I've already hiked over some pretty serious mountains, which always get your attention, and the down hills are just as treacherous, slightly jarring your knees. The good news is, that with each passing day you get stronger and I have been very lucky to have almost no soreness, which is surprising. I guess I'm most grateful for not having any blisters, which I attribute to my Injinji toe socks.   Hiking dry without any foot issues is wonderful.    I've seen no wildlife, which is not unexpected, but I'm keeping my eyes open. My weight is holding steady, which is also nice. The views are spectacular, and made very special because you can only see these by putting in the effort to hike to them.I'll finish my recap of the first week by saying I have enjoyed every minute of the hike, I do ask myself, how can something this hard be this much fun. I'll try to do a better job on my TJ, but it's obvious to me that with long hard days, spotty cell service, and so much to do in camp just to get ready for the next day, That these will be more periodic then daily. Thanks for your understanding.Got to go, hiker midnight is fast approaching..","Hiker Hostel

My Journal.   Honestly, it's just too much, a bit convoluted for me to do my entries and pics, but mostly i have not found time, which created my delays in posting, which became just too stressful.   I'm sorry, but I'm invoking the Hike Your Own Hike ( without a journal) clause.
