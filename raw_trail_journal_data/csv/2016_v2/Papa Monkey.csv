Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515194,"After 10+ years since my last thru hike attempt which ended near Harrisburg, Pa I am planning ""Round 2"" of E.R.I.C. vs A.T. The more I contemplate returning to the trial (sic: ""trail"" - is there an actual difference?) the more I recall from my last hike. It is very interesting how time can dull your memories of the challenging moments and sharpen your recollection of the fonder ones. I remember how life's simple pleasures on the trail are significantly smaller in stature to those in ""civilian"" life... for me anyway. A bottle of cold water in a cooler on the side of the trail becomes magic compared to the same bottle purchases from a convenience store on the way to work, school or where ever. I met a number of amazing people on the trail and I am sad to say I have managed to keep in touch with only one of them whom I now consider a dear friend. I have a number of stories to share about my travels with him but suffice it to say for now that I am looking forward to seeing him again around Roan Mt. 
I found an old photo from previous attempt. Ice cream never tasted better.
One could say you have to be just a little crazy to attempt a thru hike on the AT. Then again, one could say you have to be crazy NOT to attempt a thru hike on the AT!",,Katahdin,"Oct 04, Sun",0
Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515198,"I used my tent one time in 2002. Starting in May after the crowds there always seemed to be room in the shelters. Starting out in mid February I'm thinking I may find a tent more useful. Like everything else thinking one thing in your living room is way different than thinking done with a pack on your back! After agonizing over the multitude of options for ""shelter"" I decided on a Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2. Time will tell if this was a wise choice or NOT.",,Tent Selection,"Oct 04, Sun",0

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515218,"I decided to go with the Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2 after considering a number of other options. In 2002 I had a Sierra Designs Clip Flashlight 2 - which was/is still a good tent - 74oz's of good tent all included - that I used on the trail just once. (another story from the 2002 hike I'll get into more at a later time) I found after the one use and a stop at Neel's Gap I really didn't need it/I really didn't need to carry it! I opted to just sleep in the shelters most nights or if weather permitted - under the stars. Starting out in Mid Feb 16 I am concerned there may be times when there is no room in a shelter so a tent would be required. I also have minimal experience hiking in colder weather and my understanding is that a tent would be significanly warmer than a shelter. I am always open to ideas, suggestions, comments, free advice or whatever you want to call it. Actually - free ""anything"" is usually good - but NOT always! I considered many other tent options - tarptents Notch was a strong contender, as was the Big Agnes Fly Creek UL1, REI quarter dome 1/2, a hammock tent (which I did purchase one to test out from REI - but I suspect my back may not agree to sleeping on hammock    Weight of course was a major deciding factor. Condensation was another consideration as I don't like to be wet/damp. Free standing / minimal staking out was also a consideration as I am not sure how frozen the ground will actually be and if there will be room - I ""guessed"" if there are a lot of hikers - finding a spot to squeeze in a more free standing tent may be easier. Again - I am guessing and surely will comment further (multiple times) after real life experience(s) with it. I theorize tents are like Pizza's. Every town has numerous pizza shops and some how they all stay in business - everyone has their favorites, their edible and their inedibles. With pizzas - most people will try any pizza once  Tents I guess are similar to pizzas - only it is considerably more expensive to try one! I'm sure in time some Uber person will come up with something.",,Thoughts on Tent selection,"Oct 05, Mon",0
Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515279,"I have heard of ""Gold Fever"" people come down with when they set out to hunt, dig, mine, or pan for gold or just generally looking to strike it rich. I am wondering if ""Trail Fever"" is a similar affliction? I think I have it!!! I woke up early contemplating if I really need the lid to my Snow Peak 900 pot. I do not plan on using the lid for any frying. Mostly I will be boiling water for tea or to hydrate and warm prepared food or soup. I think I'd rather leave the lid at home than carry it. If anyone has any comments to add feel free to voice your opinion(s). The only advantage I can think of is water may boil faster with a lid on the pot but I am not sure that justifies the extra weight. Thank you in advance to all who comment.",,Put a lid on it ???,"Oct 06, Tue",0
Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515413,I went out for a little walk tonight to clear my head and decided to bring a back pack to get used to carrying a little weight. I didn't weigh it before I left as I didn't want that to influence my walk. I just walked a comfortabe distance from home then turned around and went back. I checked the distance on mapquest was a little surprised I had gone about 3.25 miles and even more surprised when I weighted the back pack and found it was about 17 pounds. I am seriously trying to keep under 20 lbs for my hike so 17 isn't a bad start.I find myself thinking of the trail and hike prep and keep coming back to a couple of issues I would like to resolve. If anyone reading this has any suggestions or recomendations please leave your comments in my guest book.First one is - starting in February it is going to be cold and most likely cold and wet. How do you dry out gear when it is cold out? If your shoes get wet and cold - freeze over night - how do you thaw / deal with that or similar issues? Thanks in advance.,,A short walk,"Oct 09, Fri",0
Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519575,"Anticipation is growing with less than a month before I set out on my hike. I am infinitely more prepared this time around than I was the last time. Heck, I didn't even know there was a trail guide last time out. I planned my last hike in less than two weeks and made it over half way before family issues at home pulled me off the trail. I guess I just winged it most of the time - but it was a great experience. Granted I almost died two times (not really but it sure felt like it at the time!) but I survived. I did learn after the second time - if you have a chance to get water - get it - cause the next opportunity may be too late. Anyway... A gentleman I met on the train ride down ""Birdman"" I think was his trail name, was shocked with my two weeks of ""planning."" I felt I was ready to go and had no worries. Funny how now years later and with more experience I feel less prepared. I guess it is just the jitters of the ""pre-game"" warm up... Once on the trail I know I'll be fine. Trail names tend to stick: I remember Birdman, Stan ( a virginia beach guy who loved to talk and was a great guy on the trail - I recall him quoting his mom on many things - one that really stuck was his mom saying; ""Stan - showing up for life is half the battle."" Pearls of wisdom from the trail. Then there was Chris, a Methodist minister who became a dear friend. Though we have had on and off again contact - he is a special person I'll treasure. He ended up baptizing my daughter. Then there was a guy ""Naked Tom"" who spent most of his ""camp time"" naked - which fortunately I never had to experience as we just crossed paths from time to time while hiking - as I made a point to not camp near him! A young woman Seattle whom I hiked with for a few days. Then someone Chris will never forget... Indiana - a young guy who would just not stop talking - ever. I'm sure as my hike begins I'll remember more from the first and comment on it... such as the great potato salad story which I'll go into later... and yes - you can make potato salad on the trail!","

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519870,The temperature dropped to 12 last night around 8 pm so I decided to put on my gear and go out for a 5 mile test hike. Test was successful... made it well under my 2 hour guess... and came in about an hour and a half later. The cold kept me going at a brisk pace. I did realize my lightweight base layer may need to be upgraded to a newer midweight. Getting old I guess! Also maybe need to look for a new insulating layer that comes down a little lower than waistline...The good news is no soreness so another night hike tonight as soon as the sun goes down and the temperature drops is in order - and I finish my shopping spree so to say... Time to go shopping for a few more things,"Loose ends...

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520731,"I arrived at the Rt 55 parking lot later than planned and started out not sure if this was my ""actual"" start of my thru hike since I'll be heading down to Springer in a few days - but it is the ""AT"" and it was Groundhog's Day so not a bad day to start. I was about to take a photo of the beginning of the trail when I caught my shadow making a nice outline on the road and snapped a quick photo. A little iconic to have started on Groundhog's Day and to unconsciously see my shadow- I guess that means Six more months of hiking??? Nothing is like hiking on the AT - no matter how many miles you put in training the AT still has it's surprises for you. The day was perfect for hiking with the sun shining and temperatures in the 40's-50's. A comment from Slipknot helped out to start out hiking ""cold"" and then add layers as needed. I found my hiking pants and a t-shirt were all I needed most of the day. The trail from 55 to Algo shelter was significantly more rugged than I had imagined with a fair share of ups and downs and plenty of rocks for everyone! I was surprised to meet one other couple who appeared to be out for a quick day hike. Other than them I had the trial to myself. As I was walking - a song came to mind - Paul Simon's (Simon and Garfunkel's) Sound of Silence... with a few modified lyrics... ""Hello trail my old friend... I've come to hike with you again..."" That's about as far as I got with that one... But the trail is like an old friend. It was good to be back again.","Rt 55 crossing in CT

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521170,"I'm enjoying a basic breakfast in the hotel as my thoughts wander everywhere. Tomorrow morning will be the last breakfast before hitting the trail. Freezing rain is in the forecast for today so no sense in starting a day earlier than planned. The tomorrow and the following days look clear and warmer... perfect window for a hike from Springer to Neels Gap. I just have to look up and say:""Thank You!"" 
I spent Saturday with my wife who will not be joining me on the hike but has been extremely supportive even though I know she will miss me about as much as I will miss her! (Which is a lot!!!) We drove up to Mountain Crossing for a gear shakedown by Jason and I was pleased to hear my gear looked ready to go. Maybe a little heavy on electronics but all doable. As I ditch winter gear my pack should lighten up quite a bit. My ULA-CDT is pretty much maxed out with all the extras for winter and it is small enough that I have already left a few things out that I might have brought if I would have had room... but we'll see how it works out.
My wife has a suitcase of ""extra/optional"" she can mail up if needed but would require the sending back of something to make room or figuring out how to make it work. 
Breakfast is done... more later.... Happy Trails!
Ok... It is later... I took the MARTA to the North Springs Station and caught a shuttle to the hotel from Survivor Dave... plans went off without any issues. I booked a Thai massage for this evening. .. time to kill and a nice last night in civilization indulgence... plus some stretching would be a good thing! 
So many people ask ""why"" do you want to hike the AT... There are a million or more reasons.... everyone has their own... and frequently it isn't a simple answer... of the million plus reasons... any hiker can have any assortment of multiple reasons I would guess. A few of mine are to lose weight, to get in shape and to finish what I started last time... I'm sure the list of reasons will grow as I move north.
And to everyone out there following my journal I'd like to say thank you now for all your support and kind words... whether they be past, present and/or future. I'm not sure how much time I'll have to reply but I will do my best as battery life, time and connections permit.

Arrived at Amacola visitor's center a little before they opened and they were nice and opened early so I could sign in and get moving.   I liked the sign near the falls... 425 steps. Difficulty.   STRENUOUS.   I had no idea the AT would be strenuous.   I made it up to Springer around 2 pm. I met up with Suman and Suds along the way.. it was a good day. I felt good and decided to push on to Stover Shelter. I was hoping for a big day and decided if I made it to Stover before 4 I'd push on to Hawk Mountain shelter.   I arrived at stover 20 minutes before 4 and headed out to Hawk. I had second thoughts along the way as my left knee was acting up a little. About an hour out from Hawk it started to rain... so I just kept going... in for a penny in for a pound.

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521420,"I woke up around 6 am and it qas still dark out. My previous hike took me 5 says to get to Neel's gap. This one I really wanted to make it to Neel's gap in 3 days. That meant if I were to have any chance I'd need an early start. I quietly packed up my gear and was ready to head out by 7am. 
I made it to Woody Gap so far...mile 20.8 From 15.8 so about 5 miles from 7am to 10:30am... 3.5 hours.. I got some trail magic from a trail Angel named Coach/Pilgrim on the trail... a pastry and a chicken sandwich from Chic fil-a... pretty nice and was definitely yummy!
I kept moving and along the way, I caught up to Rabbit taking a break to get some water near Lance creek camping area. I was already getting stiff/sore from hiking... being old and out of shape is highlighted on the trail!!! Rabbit was kind enough to notice I was having a little difficulty stooping to collect some water and offered to help. So far everyone on the trail has been amazing. At the water source Rabbit mentioned Subman and Suds and he were going to get a cabin at Blood Mountain Cabins and there was room for a 4th if I was interested. I said I was and moved on after filtering a bottle of water.
Sub caught up to me and confirmed the offer of being 4th in the cabin. I wasn't sure if I would make it... I really hoped I could make it... but didn't want to take the spot and then fail to show up... So I conveyed my thoughts to Sub and he said if I showed up I was welcome and if not there would be only 3 there. 
I arrived at the turn off for the woods hole shelter and made the decision to push on. My left knee was causing some pain, my feet were hurting and my pace was slow... but I felt somewhat confident I could make it. 
Going up blood mountain was challenging but I knew the down hill would be a #×%€$!!! I was right...the down hill was ""not super fun.""
I made it to the cabin about 7 pm.. it was already dark when I arrived.. 7am to 7pm... about 15.9 miles or so... not bad for a half day of hiking!","Gooch mountain shelter

After yesterday's big day it was a needed rest. Shared the cabin with Subman, Suds, and Rob who is now Rabbit.   Subman named him today after our cabin name and because he hikes fast.... like a rabbit. Unlike your's truly who is moving along at my own pace....   my feet are feeling the miles and my left knee still has a twinge on the down hills but was feeling a little better today.The weather was great and my clothing and gear has been just right so far. I can't wait for warmer weather to ditch the cold weather stuff.   For now it is a necessity as it gets REALLY COLD at night and I'm sure there will be cold days ahead still.I have plenty of food as I have not been really hungry the past few days. Drinking plenty of water so no worries there. With the upcoming rain and my sore knee I'm planning another medium day tomorrow. .. about 10 miles or so to Unicoi Gap and then head in to Hiawassee for the night... then Sunday do a quick hike from Unicoi Gap to dick's creek.. about 17 miles then back in to Hiawassee. .. I'll plan to slack pack the 17 to give my knee, ankles and feet a break and still get in some miles.

Coupled with rain in the forecast I decided to head in to Hiawassee at the earlier location, Unicoi Gap, and stay at the Holiday Inn Express which had a hot tub. As it turned out, my room had a jacuzzi tub which was perfect for a long Epsom Salt soak that should pay off tomorrow. The plan is to shuttle back up to Unicoi Gap and slack pack up to Top of Georgia Hostel, about 17 miles. The slack pack should take some of the load off my knees and ankles and keep most of my gear dry if the down poors come. I'd rather try a slack pack day then a zero day at this point. Hopefully the Epsom Salt soak, some ibuprofen a slack pack day and stretching tonight will do the trick.A special thanks to Trail Chef for some amazing rice and red beans with sausage and cold drinks. Definitely an awesome surprise at Unicoi Gap.Also a special thanks to Aaron who picked me up at Unicoi Gap and brought me to my hotel safe and sound. We had a chance to talk on the ride and from what I heard he has his own challenges but is an amazing guy. THANK YOU Aaron!Hiking with Subman, Suds, and Rabbit is a privilege on the trail. Three of the best hikers you could meet on the trail. You can't say enough about them as good people. Hopefully I'll be able to do the 17 slack pack and be back up to where they're at on the trail.

The shuttle is scheduled to be here at 8 which is a little later than I wanted but it is better than walking! It will be interesting to see as the days ahead unfold if my decision to come in to Hiawassee yesterday works out. I have 17.5 to go today and I really have no other viable options as just about all of my gear is waiting at the Top of Georgia hostel so there really is no option to stop along the way.

I'll try to update tonight from the hostel. 
I made it to the hostel pretty wet from combination of pouring rain and sweat from rain gear. I SERIOUSLY wish I still would have just skipped the TOG hostel and went into town. I don't have enough time to enumerate all the issues with top of Georgia hostel but suffice it to say for now I would have chosen to hike to the next shelter on the trail than stay here had I known what I know now. If you think the airlines are bad for adding baggage fees etc... top of Georgia hostel has them all beat. FREE shuttleshipping into town are extremely limited and if you miss them -last one into town is 4pm you have to stay another night or hang out until 1pm the next day AND PAY $10. It is total B.S. The guy Bob ""thinks"" he knows what he is doing and is a shrude business person but word of mouth regarding ripping off hikers will spread...

I was ready to go then remembered that I paid the extra $$$ for breakfast without realizing they don't open until after 7. If breakfast isn't ready at 7 can you say ""refund?"" When businesses advertise services with misleading phrases customers get upset.c Free Shuttles to town means TOG has limited shuttle service into town and they go when they want not when the paying customers want. Free WiFi means sketchy connection. 14 bed bunk house has ONE coed bathroom... Can you say hold it and wait??? Anyway... I'll never Stay here again nor recommend it to anyone. 
The weather looks sketchy but it's either go now or wait 4 days for the sun to come out. I'm mentally prepared for 3 to 4 nightmare days followed by a day in Franklin... Good bye Georgia Hello North Carolina! 
I had to wait until 7am for breakfast at tog... then had to wait again after breakfast for the 8 am shuttle back to the trail so the $6 breakfast and ""free shuttle "" cost me 2 hours of dry hiking as I was ready to head out at 6am. With heavy rain in the forecast I really Really REALLY wanted to reach Standing Indian Shelter before the rain started falling. Well... the rain came about 2 pm as the weather forecast had called for. I arrived at Standing Indian Shelter at about 4 pm after hiking in the rain for about two hours! So.. the delays at TOG really cost me.
I arrived at Standing Indian Shelter pretty much soaked - either from rain or sweat under the rain gear - which wasn't great! Fortunately all my camp gear was dry so I stripped off all the wet clothes being fortunate to be the only one at the shelter. I hung up my wet clothes and used my camp towel to dry off. I used some wet wipes to clean the mud off of my legs. Then I put on my thermal base layer and set up my tent in the shelter. It was probably about 5:30-6:00 when I got in my sleeping bag for the night. 
I was thankful to be in the shelter as it thunder stormed all night with numerous big boomers. 
I woke up around midnight to go pee and found the inside of the tent was damp from condensation so I removed the fly. Also all the clothes I hung were still wet! Actually they were wetter than when I had arrived! The damp foggy mist had permeated the shelter area.

It was still raining, my clothes were still soaked and I had 16 plus miles to go according to my ""plan"" to get to Franklin before the snow/bad weather. I thought I may have made a HUGE mistake by not playing it safe and going with my hiking buddies to hang out in Franklin and wait out the bad weather. I really didn't want to take 4 zero days in a row. The weather was in the 60's with rain and wasn't supposed to drop below 50 at night so I thought I'd be ok... OK in the sense of not life threatening.... not OK in the sense of being comfortable! 
I debated about putting on clean dry clothes but then really didn't have a good way to pack wet clothes in my pack... so I bit the bullet and put on the cold damp clothes from yesterday. I packed up as quickly as I could and started out hoping my body heat would help dry out somethings. It didn't happen! It rained hard most if the day and anything that didn't get wet from the rain got wet from sweat. I kept moving the whole day out on necessity to keep warm and to make it to long branch shelter 16 plus miles. 
There was no signal at standing Indian shelter. (Thanks AT&T ) nor at many points along the trail from Hiawassee to Franklin. I made it to Long branch shelter which ended up being an amazing shelter for the night. It was a double decker shelter and someone had hung two tarps on the upper deck to keep out the moist mist from blowing in. I actually went to bed around 5:30!

Dream On mentioned his first grand child had been born earlier in the day. It was a pretty special day. Poor kid though... only one birthday every four years!","Stecoah Gap

The hike was nice though for a short day the trail seemed to go on and on. Dream On had left before me and I managed to catch up to him a couple miles from Fontana. We hiked together for the rest of the miles to the Fontana marina. Dream On Called for a shuttle to the lodge but I decided to hike the extra mile to the visitor's center since it was a short day and I was planning a big day to start the smokeies in the morning. I hiked the extra mile then called for a shuttle to the lodge. Once I was settled into my room I went to the restaurant for lunch. I had a mushroom swiss burger with bacon, fries and sweet tea.","Cable Gap Shelter

There was a cold foggy mist lingering but my feet were staying dry. The saying ""Into the belly of the beast"" kept running through my mind as I climbed into the smokies. The climb out of NOC had been really tough and using that experience as a comparison made the climb into the smokies relatively enjoyable. There were a lot of long stretches of trail that were relatively flat or of such a gradual incline or decline that I could maintain a pretty good pace. At some point the foggy mist turned into freezing rain which was fine with me. Freezing rain is still dry. I passed the first two shelters and made it to Spencer Field Shelter. There was no one else there so I went ahead and set up my tent in the shelter and settled in for the night.

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522669,"I woke up to one of the coldest windiest mornings of the hike. The forecast had called for rain/snow all day and I debated just taking a 0 day at the shelter. Had I had signal at the shelter I probably would have taken the 0 day but ended up packing up and heading out when I determined the cold would preclude it from raining and getting me soaked. Freezing rain was just fine with me. About an hour or so into the hike the wind picked up. Going over some of the ridges were very challenging as the wind was really blowing hard. A number of strong gusts actually blew me sideways a few times. It really wasn't strong enough to blow me off the mountain but the thought did cross my mind more than once. Leaning into the wind seemed to be enough to counter act the gusts aso I kept hiking on. I lost count of how many times I wondered if the 0 in the shelter might have been the wiser decision??? I was reasonably warm, reasonably dry and aside from being alone in a storm in the middle of no where... I was fine. The thought: ""it's like being on Naked and Afraid"" only without being naked and without being afraid!!! Simply reminding myself that I was very far from help if anything were to happen was enough to keep me going slower and extremely more cautious... I made it to Derrick Know Shelter around 12:30 having started out around 7:30 so rough calculations of 6.1 miles in about 5 hours or so... turtle speed entered my mind but turtle speed and no injuries was just fine for the conditions. Again I was at a cross roads mentally... be content with my 6.1 miles and chill out athe Derrick Know shelter for the rest of the day or go on the 5.7 miles to Silers Bald Shelter??? Based on the day so far... I felt confident I could make it the 5.7 miles before sun down without any major concerns. It was ONLY 5.7 more miles and would set up the next day for a reasonable 12.1 mile push on to Newfound Gap and hitch in to Gatlinburg to resupply and rest up. I ultimately decided to push on and the actual time to process the decision was probably about 30 seconds. Again... the whole way to the next shelter I would continue to second guess that decision. After about an hour the wind picked up a little more and the freezing rain turned to a heavier wet snow. I seriously began to think...""I AM SCREWED!!!!"" among other choice words/thoughts. A couple of times I found myself having hiked for what seemed like an eternity without having seen a WHITE BLAZE!!! Delayed Panic arose with high anxiety as I continued on searching every tree for an elusive WHITE BLAZE... Being lost on some unknown trail in the storm was NOT a comforting thought. After what seemed like FOREVER a white blaze magically appeared and I thought... maybe I should donate a gallon of white paint so they could make a few more blazes along the trail!!! The wet snow continued to accumulate making the going even slower than previously. ""In for a penny, in for a pound"" kept circulating among other thoughts. There was no turning back... the next shelter should be near... And here is a ""Pearl of Trail Wisdom"" - The trail NEVER gets tired of messing with you!!! It can read your mind. If you think you're getting close to the shelter it will make it seem like it takes forever to get there. Then when you think you're miles from your destination... poof... there it is! And that was how the day ended... the Shelter just appeared out of nowhere and I was done hiking for the day. I had made it to Silers Bald Shelter in one piece. I was reasonably warm, dry except for my feet and in pretty good spirits all things considered. I quickly set up my tent and got ready for the night... I was shocked when I checked the time and saw it was only 5pm when I crawled into my sleeping bag for the night!!!","Spencer Field Shelter

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523163,"I woke up to realize that yesterday was just the appetizer for the main course today. While I was warm and snug in my sleeping bag which was in my tent which was set up in the shelter the winds were blowing all night sounding like a freight train and blowing a fine powdery snow through every nook, cranny, crack, crevice or other hole or opening in the shelter. The fine snow managed to get the mesh screen of my tent and settle on my sleeping bag and other stuff in my tent. It wasn't totally soaked but it was damp enough to cause me concern. My bag is down and I take a lot of care to keep it dry. I was hoping to be able to skip over Gatlinburg but with wet gear I now had to go into town to dry stuff out. 
The hiking was very laborious with all the additional snow that had fallen during the night. The 4.5 mile hike up to Clingman's Dome ended up taking about 6 hours or so... One of Murphy's unwritten laws is... The weather will be the worst for Papa Monkey on the Trail when he is climbing to the highest elevation on the trail. 
When I finally arrived at the summit of Clingman's Dome it was a little eerie being the only one there. Though the view was non-existent I decided to make my way up to the top of the tower anyway. I quickly realized the ramp to the tower was coated with about an inch and a half of ice. I had to use my trekking poles to dig into the ice to make it up to the top. The wind was blowing hard enough that on the way down it actually started to push me to the edge of the ramp which was a little unnerving. Since I had no traction on the ice I decided to just sit down and I slid for a little while on the ice until some packed snow on the edge stopped me. I waited for a few minutes for the gust to blow through, then stood up and moved down the ramp as quick as I could. 
I was able to go a little quicker down the trail and made it to Newfound Gap around 4 pm or so and amazingly hitched a ride into town within about 15 minutes! Miracles do happen...","Silers Bald Shelter

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523177,"After spending a zero in Gatlinburg drying out all of my gear and resupplying I woke up early to pack up and get out of town. Unfortunately waking up early doesn't necessarily mean you'll be able to get out of town early... or even check out of the hotel early... It seemed like it took me forever to pack everything up! It didn't help that once I packed everything up I realized I still had my crocks on and no socks... all of my socks were... you guessed it... packed up... So... unpack, get socks and liners out... the pack everything up ""Take 2!"" 
Little did I know at the time that would be a recurring theme throughout the day. After finally packing up, eating breakfast and checking out of the hotel I walked towards the end of town heading to Newfound Gap to hitch a ride. I have no idea how to predict who may me up while hitching. It is such a random thing. I just look at the time when I start and check the time when I finally get a ride. Considering it costs at least $30 for a shuttle I then calculate my hourly rate/savings for hitching vs paying for a shuttle. Wow... in about 20 minutes I had a ride... so hourly rate was $90 an hour... yeah... I only saved $30 but just go with it!
So... a gentleman who referred to himself as an old hippie pulling a Harley on a trailer from Illinois heading to Daytona Beach decides to stop and give me a ride up to the gap. The only problem with the plan was that as soon as we got a few miles out of town by the visitor's center we saw the sign that read: ""Road Closed"" @#$!#@%@% !!! ^@&&%%%#@% !!! Unbelievable... I get a ride out of Gatlinburg and the road is closed for snow and ice... So the gentleman was kind enough to give me a ride back to town after which he was going to try to find another road/way out of Gatlinburg. 
I texted / called my wife and asked her to check online as to the status of the road closure... I had no idea what to do next... should I just get a room and stay another night? Should I just walk the 15 miles back to the gap? (No!) So I decided to find a place to have lunch and see what unfolded. I thought if I stayed another night... I could be in the same situation the following morning... The movie ""Groundhog Day"" came to mind... 
Fortunately, shortly after I finished a long lunch the road opened and I was able to hitch another ride up to the gap. The second guy that picked my up was a little sketchy but seemed harmless enough. I was thankful I could get 2 rides out of town in one day with less than 30 minutes trying total. My previous hike it took me over 2 hours to get a ride out of town.
At the Gap, the views were clear and I took a few photos before heading up the trail to Icewater Spring Shelter. The 3.0 miles for the day sure mentally seemed like 30! 
At the shelter there was a group of college students from Virginia Tech, Penn State and VCU. They initially seemed a little stand offish but as the day turned to evening to night we all got along well. We worked together to build a really nice fire that lasted well into the night and took the bite out of the night chill.","Newfound Gap

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523180,"The 12.1 miles to the next shelter seemed like a never ending hike. The weather was reasonably nice but the trail had packed snow that had melted and re-frozen into a sheet of ice in many places. This made the going very slow as I am always aware one wrong step can end a thru hike in an unpleasant manner. I was reminded of this when a ridge runner commented on the way down Clingman's that the rangers had to evacuate a hiker who broke his ankle. Anyway... as the day went on and the temperature increased the icy spots softened up a bit and made the going a little more pleasant. A zero day followed by a 3 mile day made the 12.1 miles seem more difficult than they really were... or at least that's the story I'm going with.When I arrived at the shelter there were a few college guys playing cards. They were not as friendly as the previous nights crowd and I wasn't really in the mood to be super friendly either so I just ate a little quickly, hung my food bag and set up my sleeping area and got into my sleeping back to chill out for a while. Sometime later this guy comes in acting ""superior"" to all the other hikers... He was the second person on the hike to date that rubbed me the wrong way. I had a million things to say to him but decided to just bite my tongue and let it all go by...   This guy... I named Ranger Rick... with a letter other than R as I am sure you can guess within a few seconds! He just insisted in interjecting himself into everyone's conversation and moving it to focus on him and how great a hiker he was and all he had done... and how everyone else just didn't get it the way he did. He even went so far as to tell me later in the evening as I was helping to start a fire... that there were no ""Pine"" trees in the Smokey Mountain National Park... they were all spruce and firs.... I decided to refer to an old Chinese fortune cooking saying I had gotten once that read: ""A wise man will learn more from and idiot than an idiot will ever learn from a wise man!"" Ranger Rick was definitely an idiot in my book.The wood was too wet to get a fire going so I just went back into my sleeping bag and went to sleep for the night.","Icewater Spring Shelter

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523183,"I woke up early and wanted to get moving. I planned to get out of the Smokey's and go to Standing Bear Hostel for the night to resupply for the push on to Hot Springs. I also wanted to avoid any further interactions with Ranger Rick...The trail was surprisingly free of ice and I made good time. It helped a lot that the majority of the day would be going down hill. Down hills are sometimes more difficult than the ups depending on the condition of the trail and the slope of course. Along the way I met a couple Rangers out for a hike to somewhere. One commented he liked the way I had my water bottles slung from the front of my pack. We had a brief pleasant interaction then we were all on our way. I was expecting one of the rangers to ask to see my permit for the back country hiking but neither those two or any of the other rangers did. I got the impression they were all focused on projection a ""Helping"" presence to park visitors than that of rules enforcement. Sometime after passing the first two rangers I saw a couple sitting on the side of the trail. I stopped and said hello. They seemed friendly enough. I noticed an electronic device the man had in his hand and asked him what it was - as it looked something like a gps device but was about 2 inches thick and looked way heavier than any hiker would be carrying. It was just then I realized they were 2 rangers. The man stood up and started to explain it was a recording device they used for a survey of the forest. There was a bug/beetle that was attacking some fur trees and they were doing a survey of the infestation... I guess to plan the treating of the forest to combat the pest.Me being me... I couldn't help but ask the ranger if there were ANY Pine trees in the Smokey Mountain National Park? Talk about opening Pandora's box... within an instant he had rattled off a list of at least 7 species of pine trees... Virginia Pine was the only one I caught as he was listing them so fast... I then recounted my interactions with ""ranger rick"" who said there were no pines in the park... then shared my fortune cookie philosophy with them which they got a good chuckle out of... The one thing that really stood out during the interaction was their sincere desire to share their knowledge of the park with visitors if provided the opportunity. It was easy to see they took their jobs very seriously and were very knowledgeable and did a lot of behind the scenes work the public never sees or knows about to keep the park looking as great as it does... So... the 18.4 miles went by faster than the previous days 12.1 which is really a strange feeling. I arrived at the Standing Bear Hostel and found the accommodations to be a little rugged... but it was the only option for me at that point. First impressions were that it was a basic hostel and it would be like paying $20 to stay in a shelter. Then afterwards, you realize you got a hot shower, use of the kitchen to cook some food, (pizza in my case) and that it was a step up from a shelter. There were not mice at least! I met Wild Card... I think is what he called himself... he was a driver/currier in his life off the trail. His shoes were blown out a little and when he took off his shoes and socks you could see his toes were really red... he said he had gotten some frostbite on the trail but they seemed to be coming around. I was concerned for him and really was thankful I hadn't had such difficulties in my hike to date. I also met a young guy by the name of Major TP (indian tee pee - not the #2 TP) that was doing 20 miles or so per day on average. He was a really cool guy even though he was a vegetarian... sorry vegetarians... plants have feelings too... and animals are just ""recycled plants"" anyway... Plus our ancestors worked really hard to get to the top of the food chain... ok... enough said... but I do have some respect for vegetarians... it's not easy being ""green"" so to say... We all kind of hung out in the kitchen until we realized it was almost 11 pm and I thought... wth... it's 5 hours past my bed time... and went to bed.","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523191,"My plan leaving Standing Bear Hostel was to hike 15ish miles to Roaring Fork Shelter, then the following day hike 15ish miles to Deer Park Shelter... then do an easy 3ish miles into Hot Springs... I ended up having a harder time getting packed and out of the hostel. My body was tired from the previous day's push and I think really needed some more rest but I decided to press on anyway. I knew the hike would be as much up as the previous day's was down so mentally I think that also beat me down a little... add in the baking sun and the raging temperatures in the upper 70's and you have all the ingredients for a bad day of hiking... Yeah... Upper 70's is HOT when you are used to hiking in the 40's/50's with snow and ice on the ground. (I'm not complaining though... at least not too much!) As the day dragged on and the miles seemed to go by infinitely slowly I swore my pack seemed way heavier than it was the previous day. I had picked up a little food to get me through to Hot Springs but it really seemed much heavier. I kept thinking maybe one of the guys at the hostel put a rock or something in my pack... that thought led to thoughts of payback when I found out who had done it! Finally around 6 pm I had made it to Brown Gap, USFS 148A - a WHOLE 9.8 miles in about 9 hours... again... WTH (H = heck of course!!!)??? By my calculations... I'd make it to the Roaring Fork Shelter at 0 dark 30... I sat down on a log near the forest service road and took off my shoes and socks and put on my crocks for a little while... a small blister on my right foot from the previous day had expanded a bit so I just sat there evaluating my situation and trying to come up with a new plan. Seriously I was feeling more dejected than I had on any other day's hike. As I sat there in a fog... I decided to go through my pack and see what was in there that shouldn't have been. I took everything out... emptied every pocket and check the pockets on all my clothing that was within. Do you know what I found??? Yep... maybe you guessed it... NOTHING!!! There was no extra weight... I was really hoping for a big rock or something so my pack would feel lighter again but there was nothing...I ate a power bar and drank some water and just sat there chilling out. After a short while... Jason - no trail name - came by and stopped... He said he was going about 3 miles an hour... and was talking even faster... about all his hiking experience, skills, miles per day, and on and on... I was saying... yeah, ok, sure, yeah, ok. He did offer some blister first aid stuff for a blister I had on my right foot but I politely declined. I tend not to mess with blisters unless they absolutely require attention. This one was big.. but still intact and had migrated to the side of my foot so the bottom was fine. 
Anyway... a short while later a hiker Bootie... I think that is how he spells it... came and we talked for a little while. He was going to set up camp there. I packed up my stuff and put on my socks and shoes and headed out for the next shelter. A little ways up the trail I came across Jason setting up camp. He offered to let me camp out there as he was putting together what looked like would be a nice fire for the night. I really wanted to get to the next shelter and politely declined and pushed on. I did comment to him that Bootie was at the bottom of the road setting up camp.. he decided he'd hike back to the road area and get him.
As I pushed on the sun got lower and it really started to cool off. I crossed another road and then put on my head lamp for some night hiking as it was really getting dark. The night hiking really energized me as I got my second wind. I felt like I had just started the day hiking and was moving way faster than I had the previous day. When I came to the sign for the shelter I was shocked! It had seemed like only a few minutes since it had turned dark and I had covered another 5 miles. I decided to just ride the wave and keep going to Walnut Mountain Shelter about 5 more miles down the trail. 
I had my music going and was moving well. Fortunately the trail seemed predominately level or down hill and relatively smooth. I really enjoyed the hike in the dark, cool night. As I neared the shelter (a mile or so from it) the trail made a dramatic turn from level/down to UP! I looked for the elevator/escalator to the top but had no luck finding it in the dark... so I just kept hiking slowly up the mountain. 
when I got to the shelter there was one guy in there and of course... at 11 pm coming into a shelter no matter how quiet you are... the people there wake up. Maybe it's the high alert while sleeping that bears or other animals may come in... maybe it's just so peaceful and quiet any sound stands out... anyway... the wind was whipping pretty good. I drank some water, found the privy, and tried to settle into the shelter quietly for the night. Oh... after the first half of the day's hike monumentally sucking and it taking 9.8 miles in about 9 hours the second half was one of the better hikes... a little over 10 miles in about 5 hours... an amazing ending to what would have been a crappy day...","Standing Bear Hostel

I had decided to stay at Elmer's for reasons unknown...and by unknown I mean there are no concrete reasons why I picked Elmers... I had stayed there in 2003 during my last hike. There was/is no wifi, no computer and all the food prepared in house is vegetarian... and though I didn't actually eat there in 2003 or this time I hear the food is really amazing. The place does have a certain ""charm"" or atmosphere that just oozes peace and well being. The rooms are large with comfortable beds and whether you're just staying there for one night or spending a weekend or multiple nights it just feels right being there. I guess it is one of those things that really defies verbal explanation... you just have to experience it for yourself. (there is a link on previous post for more info on the history of Sunnybank Inn and Elmer... ) If I were hiking / passing through Hot Springs I would definitely stay at Elmer's... as I did twice. The eerie thing was after 13 years since I was last there... it still seemed familiar, comfortable and like being at home. Remarkably - I was placed in the same room as I was in the last time. I later asked / found out that room #4 is ""typically"" the room they put single hikers in... so I guess the odds were in my favor of getting the same room.Room #4 is the room Earl Shaffer stayed at during his first thru hike in 1948 and again in 1998.

Tigger is a Thru-Hiking Trail Angel that performs ""Trail Miracles!"" I met Tigger (again) along the trail as it climbed out of Hot Springs. The day was hot and sunny and the climb was a little challenging after a peaceful rest in Hot Springs. Tigger was sitting in a clearing to the side of the trail. Usually I just say hello and keep hiking but today decided to take a few minutes and sit down and chat for a little while. Tigger is a young guy out of High School taking time off before college to hike the AT... Like so many other hikers I have met along the way he is a first class guy... As we sat in the warm sun and talked a little... he pulled a chocolate bar out of a winter mitten hung on his pack... My first thoughts were of the Rocky and Bullwinkle show... ""Hey Rocky... watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat!""... only... Hey hiker guy... watch me pull a chocolate bar out of my glove... Then... he offered me some of his chocolate bar... Now... had I really been in the mood for chocolate I would not have been shy, and had we been in town I probably would have accepted some... but for some reason... once I am hiking my appetite is gone and food, all food, including chocolate loses its appeal. So I politely declined. Tigger as I found out ended up remembering me from a shelter in the Smokies.. the one with ""Ranger Rick"" in it. I didn't immediately remember him until he commented he was the guy with kidney issues... he needed to drink plenty of water... then I remembered hearing him comment about that at the Shelter in the smokies... He also mentioned he could tell I didn't really like the guy ""ranger rick"" and agreed the guy was a little annoying to say the least. Tigger then made a passing comment about focusing on the positive memories of the trial - to which I agreed...   Knowing I was trying to get 20 miles in I didn't really have the luxury of sitting and chatting all days so I got up and headed out. I usually hike with my headphones in listening to the music of the day to help pass the miles. Most of the time it is just background music to provide a backdrop to my wondering thoughts. Sometimes I put on some upbeat motivational music / work out type music for when I want to pick up the pace and get in some miles... this was one of those days. As I moved along... I had this strange feeling someone was following me... I'd stop and look back and look around and having not seen anyone kept going... then I thought I was hearing someone calling out to me... I turned the music down and again stopped and looked around and even took out my headphones... but I didn't see or hear anyone or anything... A while later down the trial... I stopped to get a quick drink of my water and check out where I was at. A few moments later Tigger came up in a hurry... sweating... and held out a zip lock bag with some stuff in it... ""I think this is yours! You dropped it a while back."" In somewhat of a trail fog... I looked at it then horror ran through my being when I realized what it was... all the consequences of having lost that bag ran though my mind in about a millisecond as I took the bag from Tigger and Thanked him not nearly enough... Having lost that bag would have put a negative shadow on my entire hike... I don't know how many times I thanked him... and the only reply I remember him saying was ""I just try to do the right thing!"" No... Tigger didn't Try to do the right thing... Tigger DID the right thing and there is really no way I could thank him enough. The zip lock bag was my ""trail wallet"" with some cash, my bank card, my drivers license and medical insurance card, my back up iodine tablets for water purification if my filter doesn't work or has issues... We continued to hike for a while together... stopping at the same point to refill our water bottles and chatted some more... I was hot and tired and kept changing my pace between the up and down hills so we kind of leap frogged on the trail for a while... As I walked and thought about all the ramifications had I lost my trial wallet... I recalled Tigger commenting about how he had left his hiking sticks in the car that gave him a ride out of Gatlinburg... Of course bad things happen in Gatlinburg... But I love my hiking sticks and once you hike with them - hiking without them just isn't the same... and I has a small sense of what it's like to lose your hiking sticks... so... on the last time I passed Tigger... I told him... when he gets to Erwin... to go to Uncle Johnny's and tell them that he is Tigger... and that Papa Monkey left something for him. My plan was to buy him a pair of hiking sticks at Uncle Johnny's and leave them for him as it may be a day or 2 before he got into town. My plan out of Hot Springs had been to do 3 twenty mile +/- days and then a 7 into Erwin. So this first night I needed to push on to Little Laurel Shelter. I knew I would be hiking at night again to get in the miles and that is just how the day ended. I arrived at Little Laurel Shelter around 10 pm. By the time I got some water, ate some food, hung up my food bag and settled in to the shelter for the night it was about 11. The day had been a success and I made it to the shelter which was my goal for the day.","Elmer's Sunnybank Inn

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523713,"It was raining when I woke up so I decided to go back to sleep and try again later. When I woke up the second time it was already getting late and the time change hadn't helped things. Knowing I had another long day which had more rain in the forecast so I packed up quickly and got moving. Mentally I was prepared for a horrendous day though I was hoping for the best. The wind was blowing pretty good, the ground was wet and there was a foggy mist in the air - but my feet were dry and that is a huge plus! They guy in the shelter had commented about taking a blue blazed trail around the ridge line that was exposed. I'm not one to examine all the minute details of the trail and know every bald, climb, gap, or elevations of all the climbs and such... but I do follow the white blazes and that is just what I do. Everyone hikes their own hikes... mine just follows the white blazes.. So... I get to the fork in the trail where the sign says - ""Exposed Ridgeline Trail"" in white with BAD WEATHER TRAIL in blue... Photo. I thought for a moment... what really constitutes bad weather? Then decided it was pretty irrelevant as I was going on the exposed ridgeline trail anyway... Initially there were a few big granite step climbs and such and of course... I thought.. hmmmm... that wasn't so bad... as the trail leveled out and became pretty smooth... then I hit another set of step climbs... again.. ok... I can deal with that... and then the rocks kept coming... climbing up and up over less defined steps and more like bolder hopping... The wind was blowing pretty hard... and I had flashbacks to going over Clingman's Dome... It was just par for the course with my hike... whether it be Clingman's Dome, Exposed Ridgelines or whatever... windy bad weather I think will just be the norm this hike... I have to admit I didn't get a photo of the sign on the southern end.. so when I got to the northern end of the split and there was another sign there... I just had to get a photo of it... I just loved the graffiti written on it too so I got a zoom up of that as well... The graffiti reads; ""Frodo and Sam Did worse. You can do it."" Of course I can I thought... I just did it... Shortly after completing the ""Exposed Ridgeline"" the sun came out and the weather became much nicer... of course it did!!!I made it to the Hogback Ridge Shelter somewhere between 10 and 11 pm and found Bootie and Major TP were there. As an added bonus... they had started a nice fire that was still burning. Though it wasn't really necessary as it wasn't very cold... it was VERY nice to sit by and dry out my sweaty shorts and shirt before getting in my sleeping bag. I threw a couple more logs on the fire to keep it going. One caught fire pretty quickly and lit up the area a little too much I thought... anyway... I set up my sleeping area as quietly as I could and hung up my food bag before going to sleep.During the night, I was woken by some shelter mice... they were a little annoying but with my food bag hanging on the bear cables - I wasn't overly concerned. Since I was already awake... and had to go... decided to go do #1 and put another log on the fire. It seemed the light from the fire scared the mice away a little and I was able to fall back asleep... this routine repeated a few times during the night... one of the drawbacks of trying to stay hydrated during the long days hike... excess fluid eventually comes out. So... the song for the night was ""come on baby light my fire..."" I'd wake up to do #1, mice would be at it, put a long on the fire, shelter gets a little lighter, mice shut up, and Papa Monkey gets back to sleep... oh well...

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523716,"I woke up and packed up to head out. Rain was in the forecast and I wanted to get moving. Thunderstorms were predicted to roll in around 3:15 or so though you wouldn't have guessed it by the clear sunny skies overhead. I was making good time and reached Sams Gap pretty quickly. After passing under the I-26 overpass I noticed a little nook with business cards for a Hiker Shuttle. I passed it up not wanting to carry additional weight but thought maybe I should have grabbed on for the number just in case. It was already too late as there was no way I would go back to get one...
A short while later I came up on a blue plastic bucket. Trail Magic!!! Nice. A zip lock bag with an apple, clementine, pack of starbursts and a rice crispy treat. I took the starbursts, and rice crispy treat but left the fruit for a future hiker who may want the fruit and not the sweets. I was a little concerned that having not had any fruit for a while it may disrupt my digestive system on the trail if you know what I mean...
I hiked on and met a few volunteer trail maintenance guys along the way. They said they come up every Monday from Atlanta area to work on the trail. Very nice of them to keep the trail in good condition. For some reason I had a craving of PB&J and I couldn't help but notice most of the Trail Maintenance guys had, yep, you guessed it PB&J's! I hiked on and ran into another group of the volunteers and decided to take a short break and sit down and chat with them for a few minutes. One of them asked me what my plans were for later in the day when the rain came? ""Get wet"" was all I could think of! But the question did sort of resonate in the back of my mind... along with the Hiker Shuttle card I had passed up earlier... 
My plan was to Hike on to Bald Mountain Shelter and then re-evaluate what I wanted to do.
I hiked on and off and on my feet, ankles, knees were causing me some discomfort. Nothing to really quit over just annoying little aches and pains. As I hiked and listened to my music I'd forget about the aches until I stepped funny or something reminded me. I'm pretty much resigned to the fact that walking all day almost everyday something is going to be aching at least for a little while longer... probably until the end... who knows... At least nothing it to the point of stopping me from moving forward.
I reached Bald Mountain Shelter around 3:15 or so and found the shuttle guy's number in AWOL's guide book on my phone (pdf version) and decided to call for some info... The shuttle was reasonable and they said if I wanted one - I could call from High Rocks - about two miles up from Spivey Gap. So I thought... I had 4 miles / 2 hours to decide and headed out for High Rocks. 
My thought process along the way was my left knee was starting to bother me a little... my feet were really starting to hurt and my left high ankle sprain (very slight/mild) was starting to bark at me a little. After a 19.6 (I'll call it a 20 mile day followed by a 22ish mile day - I was thinking maybe I was pushing it a little hard. At my pace / where I was at - I would not reach the next shelter before it got dark and it would surely be raining. Though on the way to High Rocks - the sun came out just to mess with my thought process!!! I knew there was rain in the forecast. Spivey Gap would still be a nice 16 mile day. I could then follow that up with a ""nice and easy"" 11 mile slack pack into Erwin and follow that with a 0 day to rest up and yep... get some Epsom Salt bath soaks in... So that was the plan from the ""re-evaluation"" and I went with that one... When I got to High Rocks at around 5:30 I called for a shuttle and told them it would take me about an hour to get down to the road. Tom/10-K who was the shuttle driver said he'd be there about 6:15 waiting. That was only 45 minutes so I hoofed it down to the road so he wouldn't have to wait too long. As it ended up - the trail was very nice and accommodating for me to hike fast so I moved along as fast as I could go safely. It was sunny and warm the whole way down to the road except for that last 10-15 minutes where I started to feel sprinkles coming down. I covered the miles in about 50 minutes so he was only waiting for 5 mins or so... The good thing is a few minutes after I was in the car the rain really started to come down hard.
Tom was a great guy and even stopped by Walgreen's on the way to the hotel so I could pick up a few things - Peanut butter, Jelly, half gallon of milk, epsom salts and a few other little things... If you are going to take a shuttle around Erwin - Tom is a great option.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523719,"Tom was right on time (actually early and had the front desk call my room at 9:01 as I was heading out to meet him.) He was cheerful and pleasant. With only water and my packa in case there was a freak rain storm my pack felt infinitely lighter. I was dropped off at Spivey Gap and headed off on the trail. There was an initial climb and my thoughts of a Nice and Easy 11 mile day were quick to be smacked in the face by ""reality"" as if there was such a thing as a nice and easy 11 miles on the AT??? I put on some fast moving tunes - created a new playlist... ""Move it or Lose it"" and started hiking on. On the way to No Business Knob Shelter... I crossed a small creek/stream/spring then lost the trail. What ever happened to nice and easy??? Anyway... I found it after a few minutes but thought back to my decision NOT to hike this in the dark and in the rain! Great Decision !!!!! AND I patted myself on the back... Seriously... I did... After the initial climb the trail was Ideal... nice and semi level with a gradual downward slope... I was moving along making good time. I reached the shelter which was about 5 miles in about two hours and 15 minutes... not too bad. From the shelter down there were a number of small roller coaster like up and downs... nothing too strenuous... just not all down. Not that I am complaining now... but maybe I did a little with each up hill that I didn't anticipate...I had flashbacks to my previous hike and remembered the ups and downs from then too... which I knew would be followed by what would seem to be never ending switchbacks that kept bringing you back to an overview of the city and the Nolichucky River... Finally... I made it down and crossed the road to Uncle Johnny's. I was going to buy the sticks for Tigger then rent a bike for 2 days to get around town. When I bought the sticks and told the guy there what I was doing it for... I think I made an impression... Instead of renting me the bike for $10 for the two days... he offered me shuttle rides in the van. Thank you Uncle Johnny's!!!

For someone who loves movies and goes typically at least once a week that is a big thing. On my previous hike in 2003 the new Star Wars movie had come out and I had to bribe a young couple with free tickets, popcorn, drinks and gas money for them to drive me from the NOC to Ashville to see it... about 80 or so miles one way... Yeah it was a little crazy but cheaper then hiring a shuttle! Then my second movie in 2003 was at the theater in Erwin - ""The Sum of All Fears!"" which has ended up being one of my favorite (there are many favorites) movies... This hike the movie showing in Erwin was ""Risen."" With there being a significant ""Spiritual"" nature of hiking so many miles alone in the woods... it was interesting that ""Risen"" would be playing. The movie was really good (in my opinion) and I'm sure I'll see it again many times.","Erwin TN

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524051,"As will all pleasant off trail stops leaving always seems to be on the difficult side. I have come up with a few mathematical formulas for the trail... The first is the number of ways to hike the trail which = n+1. There is always one more way to do it...   The second - I guess is not really a formula - but a relationship and that being that the difficulty in leaving a place on the trail is directly related to the level of comfort. Then nicer the stay the more difficult to get going again. That being said - I checked out of the Super 8 around 10 am and within a few minutes the shuttle to Uncle Johnny's arrived. We got back to Uncle Johnny's within a few minutes and I met Rabbit there along with a number of other hikers. Most of them were discussing the up coming poor weather, a shuttle into town to resupply or get lunch and other various trail stories.It was a warm and sunny day and I had failed during my 0 day to really come up with a good plan to get to Damascus. That indecision left me there at Uncle Johnny's soaking in the sun trying to figure out what to do next. While sitting on the table on the porch a hiker came down the trail and stopped by for a few minutes before heading right back out on the trail. I was a little impressed someone would keep hiking on and skip Erwin all together. Rabbit commented the guy was young and strong and had a small pack and was racking up the miles. I just thought - everyone hikes there own hike and good for him.
Around 11:00 am I just bit the bullet - said good bye to Rabbit and the others there and headed out. My initial goal had been to get to Cherry Gap shelter some 17 miles out of town but in getting such a late start I was kicking my self for being such a slow poke in getting out of town. I had to get to Cherry Gap and I figured at my pace of averaging about 1.4 to 1.5 miles per hour - I would be hiking for about 10 to 11 hours putting me at the shelter somewhere between 9 and 10 pm. It wasn't the end of the world but I could have gotten out earlier and not had to hike in the dark. 
My hiking was going well and before the first shelter about 4 miles out I was able to catch up to the guy who had passed up Erwin as a stop. His name was ""Who Dat"" (I hope I'm spelling it right???) I was a little surprised I had caught him based on the talk of the other hikers who had hiked with him. I followed him to the first shelter and we took a break to eat. I finished first as I typically don't take breaks and just had a quick snack. I headed out and about 20 minutes later Who Dat caught up to me and to my surprise when I asked him if he wanted to go by commented I had a good pace going up the hill and he was fine. I kept pushing on. At a water break he said I was really moving. I didn't feel I was but then again... we both admitted to being slow hikers but able to hike longer into the day. Along the way Who dat said he had already hiked about 4 miles before Erwin and was planning on stopping early at a camping area with good water. I kept pressing on and was surprised when I made it to the Cherry Gap Shelter before sunset. I was actually a little shocked. The hike had a good amount of up hills which usually slow my pace. I thought back to my slack pack day between Unicoi Gap and Winding stair gap and how it had ended up increasing my pace afterwards even with my pack on. I figured the slack pack 11 miles into Erwin may have helped out the same way... either that of the 342 previous miles are getting me in better shape!","Erwin TN

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524073,"I woke up early and was packed up and on the trail at 7:40 am. The weather was cool, dry and partly sunny - a good combination for me. I felt pretty good physically and was motivated to get over Roan Mountain to the Overmountain Shelter . The weather report predicted rain/snow and low temperatures for the three days following today. Roan Mountain was up to 6,000 ft plus so if bad weather hit it could get pretty nasty up at the higher elevations. I had enough bad weather over Clingman's Dome so really wanted to avoid it if possible. Twenty-five miles (yeah.... rounding up!) would be my biggest day yet and would definitely tax my feet, ankles and knees. I thought... once I was over the mountains I could take a short day or two to recover. 
The up on Roan Mountain seemed to never end... I didn't remember that part of the hike from my 2003 attempt. I kept picturing a green / grassy knob. I thought maybe they moved the trail or something. Now I wonder if I just didn't know the trail well enough to and have selective memory on the climb??? When I finally was up and over Roan mountain I reached Carver Gap and instantly recognized the trail ahead as what ""I thought"" was Roan Mountain... I had about 6 miles to go from Carver gap to get to Overmountain Shelter and it was still sunny with a good amount of daylight left. I didn't feel like I had gone 19 miles already... which was a good thing.
I kept hiking on and reached the Stan Murray Shelter which was still about 2 miles from the Overmountain Shelter. It was still light out but the sun was going down fast and shortly after passing the Stan Murray Shelter pulled out my headlamp so I could see the trail. I finally arrived at the Overmountain Shelter sometime after 8pm. My left foot was really hurting for the last two miles so once in the shelter - I took off my boots to check it out. I found my middle toe was infected around the nail. I saw some pus oozing out by the side of the nail and a blister/swollen area above the nail. I cleaned off my knife and cut a small slit to relieve the pressure and allow it to drain some. Being a couple days out from town to have it checked out my plan was to just keep an eye on it and hope it doesn't get significantly worse and require coming off the trail for an extended period.

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524468,"After a big day getting over Roan and discovering my infected toe I opted for a short day to 19E where I planned to take advantage of Scotty's thru hiker special at his hostel and get picked up at 19E, spend the night, then get a ride back to 19E and hike the 12ish miles back to the hostel for a second night. The second day would be a slack pack day. There are trail purests who consider slack packing sacrilegeous... but I am NOT one of them. If it works out that I can give my joints a break I'll do it! 
When I say I stayed with Scotty I am referring to the Vango/Abby Memorial Hostel. This was a great hostel for me especially since the timing of my stay was perfect with regards to both the miles I wanted to cover, the weather and the price. There are limited amenities and the privy makes it a little rugged - but.. the Astronaut Room above the bunk room is a great deal. For $40.00 for a single you get 2 nights lodging in a private room with a queen bed, TV with limited channels, a vcr/DVD with actual vcr movies... limited selection, a computer and WiFi that is like slow dial up but it does work. Plus you get a pick up at 19E and drop off next day to hike the 12ish miles back to the hostel. You can slack pack that too if you wish. That for 40 dollars I think is a great value. You also get use of the stove in the bunk house, shower, and laundry use for added fee - $5 per load for laundry. There is limited food options buy if sodas, frozen pizza, snickers/etc, Ben and Jerry's pints work Scotty's got you covered...
You can also call the Happy Cafe from 19E and they will pick you up and return you to the trail following your meal (if they have staff available) I called before heading out to Scotty's and had a delicious grilled ruben. They don't have fries but a bag of chips works.. You could also head in the following morning for breakfast before your hike back to the hostel.
Scotty is an interesting guy. He's very intelligent and friendly but is also a little stand offish in a sense that he doesn't intrude into your time/space... but will interact with hikers who initiate the interaction. He is definitely an amazing guy full of life stories and experiences... I wish I would have had more time to get to know him better.","Overmountain Shelter

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524482,"After yesterday's short day to get out of the rain I had another ""nice and easy"" 12ish mile slack pack back to the hostel. Since I had plenty of time I decided to take a lot of photos today and enjoy the nice weather. I even took the .2 milet side trail to see some falls. Typically I do not take side trails but today I did. The falls were worth the additional .4 miles on the blue blaze.
I have often thought that it would be nice to have a place to sit and relax for a few minutes along the trail to enjoy more of the senior views. To add to my previous comments on Scott - when he was giving me directions on how to get back to the hostel from the trail ( which I should have paid more attention to!!!) He said there was a trail by a bench, ""one of the only benches he'said aware of along the AT."" I then recall him saying something about a foot bridge with a hand rail and a blue blazed trail... what I missed was before crossing The foot bridge across the Uper Laurel Fork there is a blue blazed trail to the Left as you go north and the blue blaze follows the creek. If you go over the bridge you have gone too far! In hindsight, the bench comment sucked in my attention! What a great idea... and when I came upon the bench it was situated along the side of the trail facing a magnificent open view! (Photos to be added when able)
About the time I reached the bench I noticed the weather had turned significantly colder and what looked like snow/frozen rain was falling. It ended up being a mixture of snow and freezing rain for which I was VERY thankful that it was cold enough to be frozen. A few degrees warmer and I would have been soaked. 
I picked up my ace to get back to the hostel as it was just about .8 miles from the bench. I reached the footbridge in record time but didn't ""see"" the blue blazed trail to the left just BEFORE going across the bridge. (as I found out later... the blue blaze was obscured by a rhotadendran hanging from the weight of the snow)
Once across the bridge I had unknowingly already GONE TOO FAR!!! (Isn't there a movie-A bridge too far???) I continued on searching for the blue blaze for .4 miles according to gut hook before turning back. The .4 miles seemed like a coincidence considering that was how far I had gone to see the water fall. Was someone sending me a coded message? (Coded message decoded: you can walk/choose to walk .4 miles out of your way to see a water fall or you can choose to not pay attention to directions and end up walking .4 miles out of your way only to turn around and walk .4 back!) Yeah... I know.... it isn't an either or situation as you can as I did ""do both!"" But the point is what would you rather do? And for the philosophy majors out there... yeah being on the trail gives you plenty of time to let your mind wonder... and I DO realize it was walking the .4 back and forth that created the comparison to raise the value of the .4 side trip to the falls... and that without having the comparison I might not have appreciated the .4 mile side trip to the falls... AND for the non philosophy majors out there... sorry AND it is simply better to walk .4 miles to see a water fall than to walk .4 miles X2 cause you made a mistake in navigation!

The weather was still pretty cold out but I was warm enough once I started moving. I wore my gloves without lthe liners to keep my hands warm.
The middle toe on my left foot was still infected and was of concern to me. Having been a medic in the national guard I knew it wasn't life threatening but with poor circulation to the toes if the infection took off it could mean the loss of a toe within a few hours. I didn't think it was a high probability but more of a possibility. Either way getting to a doctor and getting it looked at and some antibiotics were definitely a HIGH priority! Throughout the day I kept taking a mental inventory of how I was feeling and of the hiking plan to reach Damascus ASAP.
My first goal was to reach the Lake Watauga Shelter which would have been a good day of 22 miles or so and then reassess. That would give me a shot at reaching Damascus in 3 days. I was also looking on the map for road crossings where I could bail off the trail and hitch a ride in an emergency if my toe made a drastic turn towards the worst.
I reached the shelter in good time and was feeling pretty good so I decided to push on and see how far I could go. 
As the sun went down a chill settled in but as long as I kept moving I was warm enough. I stopped to get a drink of water and the cold night immediately reached out and grabbed me. I finished my drink and started moving again. That was the last time of the night I stopped for anything... I just drank on the move if I got thirsty or ate on the move.
It was already pretty dark out as I was passing by the dam and I put on my headlight and turned it on. My biggest fear was losing the trail in the dark and wasting time and miles getting lost. As I crossed the dam road and turned left to go up a road I was a little concerned as I hadn't seen a white blaze for a while even though I had continuously been scanning the sides of the road for one. I turned around to look for one going the other direction and was able to find one so I kept going up the road. A shot while later I found another blaze and was able to relax a little. Finally I reached the point where the trail left the road and headed into the woods. I prefer hiking in the woods at night as it's easier to see the trail in the dark. Sometimes when the trail crosses a road or follows a road for a while it's easy to miss a turn and get lost.
After the climb on the road and the turn into the woods the trail continued to climb. The sky was clear and many stars could be seen in the sky. Once up on the ridge that ran along the river/lake/water I could see the lights on the other side. 
As I hiked listening to music I made a point of not looking at the time or where I was at as far as milage and just kept going. 
I passed a few shelters with sleeping hikers in them along with a number of tents at camp sites along the way. 
As the sun was starting to get ready to come up I decided to pull out my phone and try to figure out where I was... I realized very quickly that I was in a state of confusion from being very tired sleepy wise and very exhausted at the same time. My feet were aching despite the ibuprofen (taken with food of course). I had a couple of miles to go to reach Double Springs Shelter which would make a 44.5 mile day... 1.5 miles more than my previous best of 43. Any pipe dreams of making it to the next shelter and a 50+ mile day were gone. I would be happy to get to double springs and call it a day.
The last mile seemed to take forever. I felt like I was walking through quicksand and walking drunk at the same time. Mentally and physically I had really exceeded my limits and pushed about as hard as I could have. I reached the shelter around 6 and was pretty happy with my 44.5 miles in 21 hours. I recalled that my 43 mile day had taken 23.5 hours so I considered my more miles in 2.5 fewer hours a double win.
At the shelter I got really cold really fast and struggled to get my sleeping pad blown up and into my sleeping bag. I was shivering on top of my physical and mental exhaustion. I knew I needed to get in my bag ASAP. 
After zipping up my bag and cinching up the bag around my head I pretty much passed out.","Vango/Abby Memorial Hostel

After a few minutes I tried to sit up again. I was still too tired to think and decided to go back to sleep.
Sometime later I woke up again and was able to get up and pack up and get moving. I couldn't even do the math to figure out how many miles I had left to get into Damascus. My feet were killing me and I was wiped out. By the time I decided to bail I was past the 421 crossing and I was not going back... the Forest Service road at McQueens gap was the only out before Damascus. I called for a shuttle to pick me up there and they met me there at about 2:30 in the afternoon. I got into town and called Enterprise to move my rental up a day to the next day... the 23rd. I got a room at Dave's place, got some food and went to bed early. Enterprise would be coming in the morning to pick me up and then I'd be able to get my foot/toe checked out and head out for my planned break for my anniversary and my birthday.

Ok... for the details. I rented a car for my time off the trail and returned it in the morning they the guy at the rental place was giving me a ride back to Damascus where I'd have to arrange for a shuttle back to the trail. Having nothing to lose I decided to ask the guy driving IF he had to drop me in the city area or if he could drop me off any where. He said he's told to take the customers wherever they want to go! So I asked him if he knew where McQueen Gap was... he didn't have a clue and neither did I... I should have been paying attention when the shuttle picked me up.
Anyway... the driver added if you can get me directions I can take you there. I said we could stop in town at MRO and get directions..
So we stopped there and the guy was really helpful. He pulled out a map and showed the driver where to go.
Even with the directions we drove past the turn and had to go back to find the US Forest Service road... a dirt/gravel road up the side of a mountain. I thought the guy was going to change his mind when he saw the road. But he kept going. After a few minutes I silently sighed in relief as the road was narrow enough that there was NO way to turn around... 
We arrived at the top after about a 20 minute climb with some sharp cliffs along the way. I felt a little bit guilty having him drop me off there so I got out pretty fast so he could be on his way. I gave him a tip and he was on his way...
Only after he left did I realize my poor planning!!! I had originally planned to get into town, find a place for the night then call for the shuttle to slack pack... but the savings of the cost for a shuttle distracted me from that plan... so there I was at McQueen gap and I was still in crocks with no socks! I also realized I didn't have any water... but I did have a nearly full 2 liter bottle of coke from the drive the day before, a pocket full of change I had for tolls in Florida, a piece of birthday cake in a zip lock bag that weighed about 2 pounds and too much other stuff to list... I was not a boy scout and I was NOT prepared to hike...
Anyway... I got my socks and shoes on, got myself situated and started walking he 12.4 miles back to Damascus. 
It didn't take long for me to start second guessing some of the gear changes I made during the time off. It was on the cold side and windy and I had left a lot of my cold weather gear behind. Once I got going I was warm enough but still... wondering if I should have kept a little more warmer clothes. Then, after a few miles my feet started to hurt. I was thinking it was just because I had too much time off. But then I was feeling every rock and root on the trail. It felt like I was walking barefoot! The new shoes I had felt amazing in the store but on the trail with a pack on they couldn't be farther from amazing! I took some ibuprofen and hoped that would get me into town.
I passed a couple hikers at the first shelter that were packing up. Grandma and another guy.I'm not sure if I would let a trail name like grandma stick but this guy kind of embraced it... A little while later they both passed me like I was standing still. My feet were really an issue and I couldn't think of a day previous when they hurt so much... even with an infected toe. Still I was wondering if there could be wrong with my feet, if it was just from getting back on the trail after a break or it was the shoes... Being new shoes they were suspect. I didn't think it was due to them being new and needing to be broken in as they were light weight trail runner type shoes. I think it was more a lack of support collapsing my arches.
Anyway. .. I made it into town and went to the Dancing Bear B&B for the night so I could watch the Women's NCAA Championship game... UCONN was playing for their 4th in a row and being from Connecticut I wanted to watch the game. 
After checking in and taking a shower I headed over to Hey Joe's for dinner. I couldn't decide between a chicken quesadia and the Hey Joe's nachos with pulled pork so I ordered them both. My feet were still killing me so I just sat there hanging out eating slowly and enjoying the atmosphere. The food at Hey Joe's is good but the place is not run as smoothly as it could be... but if you embrace the chaos and don't have your heart set on something specific it's a good place. This night they obviously forgot they were the only place in town open for dinner and were not ready for a busy night. They ran out of cucumbers for my salad... which I was fine with as they substituted red bell peppers and sliced mushrooms for... but then they were running out of some kinds of bottled beer other customers were ordering... the customers settled for other beers including bush light in a can... but not great for business in the long run!
I finished up my food and went back to Dancing Bear to watch the game and finally update more of my journal entries!!! UCONN won by 31 and I went to bed happy!
I have a song for that... Queen... ""We (UCONN) are the champions!!!""","McQueens gap

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526845,"I woke up and was packed and ready to head out in record time. Breakfast was at 8:30 so I headed out to the post office to mail some souvenir stuff off to my daughter and pick up some things at the dollar store.At breakfast I met Slip & Trip. A hiking couple. She said her age to which I told her not to tell lies... that she didn't look a day over 38... We started talking about hiking shoes and Trip mentioned the 276 outfitters in Franklin and a brand of boots they fit him with that fit perfectly! I knew the Franklin outfitter was food but when I went through Franklin my shoes, moab ventilators were doing great... it was just the last day or so before getting off the trail that they started squeezing my feet some. The comments from Trip did ring a little bell on my mind.
I finished breakfast and got my gear to head out of town. I remembered the way out of town from my 2003 hike and it seemed eerily familiar... a lot of the trail up to then seemed to have changed with only small sections seeming the same. This was definitely one of the ones that was the same.
Even before I was out of town my feet were bothering me. I had taken more ibuprofen at breakfast and was hoping it would kick in soon. I put on some music and tried to distract myself which worked for a while. The first shelter was about 8 miles from town and I thought I'd take a break there and eat the last of my birthday cake I had been carrying. German chocolate cake can be very heavy for it's size! 
I was making reasonably good time all things considered and reached the turn off to the shelter. The sign said it was too far off the trail so I just kept going. 
The trail joined with the Virginia creeper trail for a while and I came upon a bench. I decided to sit down, have some cake and take a break.
My feet were still killing me so I just beside myself with what to do. My new shoes were not going to work. As I pushed on I got some signal and was able to contact some friends to workout getting off the trail to get some new shoes.","Damascus, VA

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528003,"Sorry for the long delay in updates. A lack of good signal and trail issues have been plaguing me lately. Anyway....
Sunman and Suds picked me up early 7am at Trail Chef's house in Franklin and we enjoyed a nice drive back to Damascus. I started my hike with them and hadn't seen them in a while. They are great people. It was good to spend some time with them as most of my hike so far had been pretty much me and the trail. Sub and Suds dropped me off where I had hitched a ride on 58 about 16 trail miles from Damascus. They were going to go back to Damascus so they'd be a day or so behind. Assuming I would be able to resume my big mile days with my new shoes we kind of figured that would be the last time we'd see each other on the trail. 
I had I big climb up to the Greyson Highlands with my destination being Wise shelter. Getting a late start on the hike wasn't the best idea but that was how it went. I think it was around 11:30 am when I started up. The trail was very rocky with patches of snow still on the ground and muddy soggy trail where the snow had melted. Having taken a few days off at Trail Chef's house hadn't helped my trail legs and I thought about having only hiked 4 of the past 16 days or so. Most of the people I was around hiking were about 200 miles up the trail past me and there were some people now I had never met... and I wasn't in the best socializing mood... oh well.
The day was sunny but colder than I had expected and the snow, soggy trail, rocks and poor mood made the day's hike one of the more challenging of the hike to date. I just kept trudging on trying to keep my feet dry.
I made it to the first shelter and thought for a moment about just staying there but decided to press on. It was still light out when I made it to the Highlands and saw some Ponies. They were all busy eating and I couldn't coax them into looking up for a photo so just took some of them eating. The Highlands had a ton of rocks to go with their up and down terrain making the going slow. Having to watch where every step will go on the rocks is also very mentally taxing.
As I was crossing the Highlands the sun was going down and I still had plenty of miles to go to get to the shelter. I thought about just tenting and calling it a day but didn't see any good camp sites. I put on my light and was ready for some night hiking. I thought I would be able to make it to the shelter 16.4 miles before dark but I obviously thought wrong! 
I hiked on in the dark having a couple miles left to go. My feet were hurting but not from the shoes so that was a silver lining in the dark clouds following me for the day. 
Abut 30 minutes from the shelter I felt a few rain drops hit my arms... great... it was not supposed to rain! Oh well... I couldn't go any faster so I just kept going to the shelter hoping it would hold off until I arrived. Thankfully it did.
I arrived at the shelter and some people were still awake so that was good... one of the hikers Big Zero recognized me from Gooch Shelter and we took a few minutes to catch up before another hiker sushed us and we too went to sleep for the night.","US 58

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528344,"I woke up early and packed up from Wise and was on the trail by 7:30. It may have been earlier as I had been hiking for some time before checking the time. Physically I felt OK but mentally I was still in a haze. My goal was the shelter about 20 miles out and I kept plugging away. Throughout the day a lot of hikers were passing me up. I'd try to keep up for a while then just fall back to my comfortable but slower pace. Speed is not my strong suit... but I can hike for plenty of hours.. 
I got to a grassy bald and took a panoramic photo while listening to a song and just taking in the view. The 360 view was amazing and I soaked it in to remind myself of one of the reasons for hiking a thru hike... to enjoy the views! 
I pushed on and my feet were growing weary with the miles. I arrived at the turn off to the shelter at about 4:30 with plenty of day light left. I had during the day contemplated going to Partnership shelter, another 10 miles or so...
Now I was faced with that decision to make. I was at the fork on the trail. The shelter was about .4 or .5 off the trail so I decided to just go for it. Knowing rain was in the forecast for the following morning made it wOrth going for...
I continued on and made it to the next water source about 2 miles up the trail. My feet were starting to bother me more but I wasn't going to go backwards and tenting wasn't a serious consideration with rain in the forecast. Tenting was an option but only as a last resort.
Ironically I set out on the additional 10 miles so I wouldn't have to hike with wet feet... and guess what? At the first water source on the trail my left foot slipped and went right into the water... I looked at my left foot which was now soaked wondering what to do now??? I just took my right foot and stuck it in the water too! At least my feet would be of even weight/condition. Then I filtered the collected water and continued on with wet soggy feet... go figure!
It was a long 8 miles or so to Partnership Shelter and the visitors center. I had my headphones one with every song that could help me along. I took some additional Ibuprofen to try to lessen the pain in my feet and kept moving. Fortunately after one last big climb the trail leveled out along a ridge and stayed that way for most of the way to partnership shelter. I used my guthook app to make sure I was still on the right trail and to update me as to how much further I had to go. 
Finally I made it to the shelter around 10:30. The lower level looked full so I figured I'd have to climb up to the second. My feet were killing me at this point so I kept going to the closed visitors center and sat on a stone wall in front to take off my shoes and check out the damage in the streetop lights. They were a little soggy but not TOO bad...
I let them air out for a while before putting on my crocks and pulling out my sleeping gear from my pack and heading back to the shelter for the night.
Climbing up the ladder to the second level with my sleeping pad, sleeping bag and stuff out was challenging. Fortunately there was a space left and I set up as quietly as I could and went to sleep.","Wise Shelter

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528351,"After and additional day in Marion to get to a doctor to take care of my toe that was showing signs of infection again I was back on the trail. The benefit of an unplanned zero was now I was on pat with Subman and Suds. I was just an hour or so behind with a short day to relax inn planned. The hike was not too challenging and my feet felt better. And with antibiotics in my pack I felt better heading out towards Paris burg which was at least 4 to 5 solid days without a good town with a dr. 
I was moving along well and in a little better spirits. I reached the school house at the Settlers Museum and saw a couple packs on the ground. I thought they were Subman's and Suds' so I went into the school to get some trail magic - a cold mountain dew - and sat in the sun on the front porch with my socks off. I spread my socks out some so they could dry out as I Waited for sub and suds to come back.
They came back a little while later from visiting the museum and we headed off towards the relax inn. 
We arrived at the relax inn and checked in. Thanks to ANOTHER data breach with my Bank of America card... check in was a pain... I wish I had time to switch banks.. BOA... is a very bad bank...
Anyway... after checking in we headed up to the barn for a 16oz hiker burger that really hit the spot! So much so that we didn't need dinner that night and made do with a few snacks. I decided to spend the next few days tagging along with sub and suds to give my feet and body time to get back into hiker shape before my iron will hiked them into the ground again.

I tempered my desire to get moving for big days and just settled in to the 16.1 day. Along the way I met Claire and her brother again... I had met Claire in Damascus coming out of the dollar store.... she went to trinity college in my neighborhood and did crew which my daughter does... so that was cool.The hike was enjoyable though it's constant work... we arrived at the campsite and it was still daylight. For the first time of the hike I set up my tent on the ground. All previous tenting on this hike had been in empty shelters.

Sometimes people don't realize or understand what it means to be a thru hiker or the challenges. It is also a challenge for those off the trail supporting the hiker... but in my case I am determined to complete my hike this year in the year of the Monkey! Hopefully those in my life will come to understand but either way this is probably the last opportunity for me to do a thru hike and I'm going to finish as long as I can walk!
We made it to the shelter and I was happy to see DREAM ON was there AND he had a fire going and music playing...he had Portishead on and a few other songs I liked/enjoyed. It was a nice shelter to spend the night. N.O.W.A was at the shelter also and is a class guy. He didn't say a lot but had expressions that said it all as he listened to us and worked on updating his hiking plan.

I made a command decision to push on and try to find a camp site where I could start a fire to dry out. My pack rides against my back so my shirt and waist area are typically drenched in sweat by the time I get into camp. Usually it drys out quickly but in the dark I really needed a fire to dry out. A short while past the shelter I found a couple tent sites but unfortunately they were already taken. I kept pushing on and found one that looked perfect and was completely empty! Yeah!

Burgers, Hot Dogs, cold drinks, chips, oreos, and other yummies! This was one of the best trail magic events along the way so far! Definitely a mood / moral booster! 
After a while of enjoying the amazing hospitality I set out with Subman and Suds to Trent's for a few things thought the big meal definitely lightened the snacks I'd have to get at trents and carry with me. We all managed to hitch a ride from Trent's back to the trail and hiked the few miles up to Dismal Falls.

I also figured better to just head out of town.I missed a turn early and ended up in an old cemetery which was pretty interesting. There was one of a Military Person ""Pearisburg"" whom I am assuming is the one the town is named after... I could be wrong... I'll google that one later to confirm.After making the wrong turn and heading back I met a couple women out for a section hike at the fork where I made the wrong turn.

Pam and Cathy said they were planning to head out between 7 and 8 and I was hoping to be ready to go when they head out. They had a plan to get to Troutville by Thursday and I was hoping to get to Daleville a couple miles before Troutville. That would make about 100 miles covered in 6 days which would be a nice week for me. The trail wasn't too challenging as far as ups and downs but the trail was full of a lot of rocks and was a pounding on my feet. There was also a long stretch without water and with the weather being much warmer / hot out carrying plenty of water was difficult. I kept praying for a trail angel with some water at each road crossing and forest service road that seemed to have reasonable access but unfortunately there were none. As the day was winding down we reached Wind Rock area with only about a liter of water each. I was really REALLY thirsty and knew 1 liter wasn't going to be enough considering the next water source would be about 5 miles away. We looked around and debated moving on the the next shelter that night or just calling it a day and camping there. The call it a day and camp there option won out. Fortunately the Camp there won out as just after I had set up my tent I noticed a bunch of ""day hikers"" coming up the trail from the road less than a mile away. One of the guys was carrying a 12 pack of Bud light lime (which I would never think about trying off the trail!!!) I called out to them if they were coming up to just watch the sunset and they said they were. Then I asked if they needed a hand carrying the beverages up and they just laughed...   Then a few more came up the trail carrying various bags and things. Wind Rock was a great spot to watch the sunset so a little while later I went up to watch the sunset and see if I could in ""Subman's words... Yogi some beverages!"" When I got up there one of the women asked me if I wanted a beer... which of course I did since I was really really thirsty! Honestly I would have been just as happy with a bottle of water! After accepting the beer the woman said they had plenty and to invite my friends up if they wanted to come. The group of day hikers ended up being Vet students from VT and were all really cool! We talked about hiking and thru hiking experiences and thanked them repeatedly for their generosity. In addition to the beer they did have plenty of water and I was able to fill up all of my bottles and get enough to fill up Pam and Cathy's water bottles... which was a huge stress relief. After watching the sunset scuba built a nice fire and I roasted my marshmallows I had hiked in from Pearisburg. There are a lot of vegans on the trail and I did not know that marshmallows had ""animal"" products in them... go figure... so I ended up being the only one to eat them which was fine by me! The ""leavers"" were there also and we had an interesting philosophical discussion on global warming/climate change and other things. It was interesting to hear the ""leavers"" say the climate change issue was ""settled science"" and talk about not contributing to global warming by not supporting the cattle industry and being vegans so they didn't contribute to the ""methane"" from farming etc... etc... etc... They are filming for a ""documentary"" and I pointed out that all their electronics and cameras, cellphones and light weight synthetic camping gear are made in china where the labor force is exploited for low wages, the heavy metal contamination of the electronics industry pollutes china's lands and waters, and that china has no ""environmental"" controls so their electronics and camping gear are contributing to the climate change and exploitation of the Chinese workers... to which they said they knew and were struggling with that... I asked them if it were possible to provide things people wanted (meat) without causing the negative effects.. and they were remarkably against that being a possibility.

I easily could have drank all the water on the climb up but rationed it so I would have half left for the down hill... which I remembered from the last hike was long and challenging.I reached the top and was able to go see the Dragon's Tooth rocks and take a few photos before heading down the mountain to the Four Pines Hostel. The down hill is very challenging over some rocks / cliff faces where you have to be exceptionally careful where to place your feet so you don't fall... and you definitely do not want to fall! I kept thinking... ""I did this in the DARK???"" ""WTH was I thinking???""   It was really challenging in the daylight... but before I was very motivated knowing I was dehydrated, out of water and in tough shape... I made it to the road and met up with Cathy and Pam before heading to the Hostel. They were going to camp a few miles down the trail and I was planning to stay at the hostel and check out slack packing the next day to Daleville. We said our good byes thinking this may be the last time we saw each other... I asked them to sign my journal but we'll see....I made it to the hostel in significantly better condition than the previous time and had a great night there... I even got to play a game of chess which I won... though the guy I was playing was ""stoned"" so it really wasn't a big accomplishment....","Niday Shelter

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531173,"So... after a night at a full Hostel and the decision made to slack pack I set out for Daleville. I got an early start and was hiking towards the trail by 7 am. Carrying virtually an empty pack and water made for semi easy going but it would still be a long day! 25.7 miles isn't just a walk in the woods! The hike would take me to Mcafee Knob and Tinker Cliffs along with the Kefer Oak Tree... Plus it was my dad's birthday so hopefully I'd have signal along the way to wish him a happy birthday.I made it down the road the half mile to the trail and started up the trail. I was paying particular attention to the greenery along the trail as I noticed coming in there was a lot of POISON IVY along the trail... I do not get along well with poison ivy and anything I can do to stay away from it would be great! A few miles into the trail I saw Cathy and Pam breaking their camp. I stopped to say Hi / Goodbye and remind them to sign my trail journal... but nothing yet... Char!I was making good time and feeling good about the hike until I started the climb up to McAfee Knob. Even slack packing the up was challenging... I made it up of course and took a few photos before heading out. I missed a turn and found myself below Tinker Cliffs before realizing and heading back to find the trail that went squeezing through a couple big rocks.I saw my first snake of the trail in a stream after crossing a meadow... I think it may have been a copperhead or something but it saw me before I could get my camera out and went behind some rocks. I decided NOT to hang out there too long to wait for it to come out and moved along up the trail. The Kefer Oak was pretty amazing. I was able to get some good photos with my camera but again... the computer in the Library here in Buena Vista VA doesn't have a SD card slot for me to get photos here... I am thinking I need to get a USB sd card reader thing... but then again... the thought of carrying that over the miles isn't the most pleasant!Between phone calls, downloading a video of my daughter playing A Thousand Years on her Saxophone and using Guthooks app for navigation my phone battery died! That was not good... as I had always not worried about my phone going dead cause I have a back up charger... but I hadn't considered it could go dead in one day of slack packing! So I had no way to call anyone if an emergency came up... I didn't know what time it was and I didn't have a guide book to figure out where I was on the trail... But there was plenty of daylight left and I knew I had to get to HOJO's anyway... so I just kept moving.As I finished a big climb and was up on a ridge the trail started to seem familiar. It reminded me of a day I hiked in 2002 with Pan and his dog into a hotel that had a Chinese Buffet across the street. In 2002 it was a Sunday and it was raining and we ended up going over to the Chinese Buffet since there was nothing else close by to do... We arrived when they opened at 11 am and sometime later... a woman came up to us and said ""You eat too much!!! You go now!!! We close 30 minute ago... WE want to go home!!!"" We both looked out the window to find it was dark out and were totally amazed that it was 10:30 pm and we had been there ALL DAY!!! Yeah... we got thrown out of a Chinese Buffet... That was a first!So... I kept hiking as fast as I could go and the further I went the more the trail came back to me... I descended off the ridge and followed the trail as it went through a vegetation like tunnel and I came out on the main road. The HOJO's was just a little ways to the right and it was the place I had stayed with the Chinese Buffet across the street! Only the building was now a Mexican restaurant and it was closed... Oh well... It would have been nice to see if I could get thrown out again!I checked in to the hotel and took a quick shower before heading over to the Pizza Hut for dinner...I really wasn't that hungry but I was VERY thirsty. I opted for the Pink Lemonade and drank 3 glasses even before ordering... it didn't take long for the waitress to bring me 2 glasses full so she didn't have to make so many trips! I opted for the all you can eat salad, bread sticks and soup. It was only $7.99 and I figured the salad would be good for me... They had a ""loaded baked potato soup"" that was really good. I just had 2 cups of soup, the salad and a couple bread sticks... I finished up and the waitress was nice enough to get me a to go cup for the lemonade... I was still thirsty! I went back and fell asleep quickly... but woke up dying of thirst at 3 am... I drank the rest of the lemonade but was still thirsty so went out into the darkness to see if I could get something to drink. Two of the gas station/convenience stores were closed!!! They had their lights on and people were pumping gas but the stores were closed... Char!!!Then I saw one down the hill from the hotel and went there... I ended up getting 6 quarts of Gatorade... since they were 2 for $3 and I was going to zero the next day and the hotel room had a refrigerator... I drank one before I even got back to the room and a second before going back to sleep...","Four Pines Hostel

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531174,"I took a nice 0 to rest up and resupply... I walked down to the grocery store for a few things and had lunch at the Chinese buffet. The food was pretty good and reasonably priced... it wasn't ""outstanding"" like some other hikers had said but was decent. After lunch I went over to the Three Pigs BBQ to get some ribs for dinner... I didn't want to have to walk back down for dinner so I figured I'd just heat them up in the microwave.St. Louis ribs were somewhat disappointing... I guess I don't know what St. Louis ribs are... but they were not the fall off the bone tender ribs I was hoping for. They were a little tough and seemed a little bit dry too... maybe I should have opted for the pulled pork or something... Anyway... I got to bed early after a nice day of resting","Howard Johnson's

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531176,"I ended up waking up early but taking a long time to pack up and get out of the room. I was awake at 6 am and down for breakfast but it was 10 am before I checked out and was heading to the trail.On my zero day I came up with a plan to get to Buena Vista VA fro my next break... it included an 18.5 day, an 18.4, a 17.7, 17.2, and a 13.1 but the thing about plans is sometimes they change on the trail!So... heading out with a 10 am start... and planning on an 18.4 mile day at my snail's pace of about 2 miles per hour I figured I'd reach the shelter arould 7pm.I hiked along the trail taking a few photos along the way and just kind of doing my hiker thing. I arrived at the shelter around 7 pm as scheduled after a fairly non eventful hike. I felt pretty good and it was nice to have done the 18 plus miles after getting a late start and I even arrived with the sun still up! There was room in the shelter so I just set up there... Ronjon, Mr. Wizard, Captain America and a few other hikers I didn't know were there. In the morning... a trail maintenance guy came in to clean up some trash from the shelter and was talking alot about his hikes and trail philosophy... for me it was like blah blah blah.... until he uttered a pearl of wisdom....   People think the trail gets easier... IT DOESN""T!!! The trail is always just as difficult... you just get to covering it faster...   This made a lot of sense to me...","Howard Johnson's

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531178,"The plan was to hike to Cornelius Creek Shelter for another reasonable day of 18.4 miles. I was tempted to push on a little farther but decided to hold back the reins and stick to the plan... for now anyway...The hike was pleasant and relaxing and I took a few photos along the way. As I grew nearer to the shelter it started to rain. I put on my packa which seems to be perfect for hiking in the rain when it is warmer out... for me anyway...I arrived at the shelter to find it FULL of section hikers!!! This was not a pleasant thing as it meant I would need to set up my tent in the rain and that would mean carrying a wet tent the following day which was not a pleasant thing either... I bit the bullet and set up my tent quickly and put my gear inside to keep it from getting wet.... then went over to the shelter to hang out for a little while... The section hikers were ok guys and they had brought corn on the cob, steaks, sweet potatoes and a cast iron pot of baked beans... I wasn't really super hungry but the thought that it would have been nice for them to have brought extra food to make up for hogging the shelter would have been nice. I didn't say anything... but I am sure they got the vibe from all the thru hikers who had to set up tents in the rain...After they had eaten there was a fair amount of food left and they offered it to any of us thru hikers who wanted some... If you are offered and want some you have to speak up and not be shy... especially with a bunch of vulture thru hikers... I got a paper plate of beans, a chunk of steak... about half of a baked sweet potato and an ear of corn... It was really good... especially the baked beans... and I was amazed how fast I ate it considering I wasn't even really that hungry!!!After eating one of the guys was telling jokes while some of us hung out by the fire trying to warm up and dry out a little in the on and off rain... After I thought I was as dry as I was going to get I excused myself and went off to bed in my tent...","Bobblets Shelter

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531181,"Waking up at 5 am well rested isn't a bad thing on the trail unless it is pouring rain out and it was! I tried to get internet to check the weather but the signal was weak and intermittent and I could not get anything... so I decided to try to go back to sleep. A little while later I woke up again and managed to send out some text's to try to get a weather update. It was still early and with the intermittent unreliable signal ""THANKS AT&T"" I was just figuring on rain all day...My plan called for going the 17.7 miles to Matt's Creek Shelter and by the time I realized it I was already behind the 8 Ball.... I figured everyone else would be in a race of sorts to get to the shelter to claim a space so they didn't have to deal with setting up a wet tent in the rain again... When I finally packed up and got out to break down my tent and get moving I found I was one of the only ones left... everyone else was packed up and gone...I packed up quickly and put on the packa and headed out with just the 3/4 liter of Gatorade. I figured in the cool rainy morning I could go light on the water and hopefully be able to catch someone / pass some of the other hikers to get a shelter spot. I usually didn't stop for lunch so I figured if I moved it I might be able to pass someone... I was hiking as fast as I could and managed to catch one guy and pass him up... but then as the day went on... things started to warm up and the sun came out. It actually started to get HOT! My 3/4 liter of gatorade didn't last long and I hiked for a couple of miles until the next water source came up where I drank a liter and filled up my bottles. I hiked on and passed the first shelter where I saw a couple hikers had stopped for lunch. So far so good... but then as I was checking my position on the map I realized I was making good time. The miles were going by rapidly and I figured even if I made it to Matt's Creek Shelter I wouldn't have enough food to get to Buena Vista AND Glasgow was ONLY another 2 miles and change... with a restaurant... Scotto's with PIZZA and a hot shower at the shelter... So I found out Scotto's was open until 8 pm since it was a Sunday night. I could make it there in plenty of time so I changed my plans and set out to get to Glasgow... my 17.7 miles morphed into 19.9 but that was fine.
I made it to the road across the St. James River bridge about 4:30 which was amazing time for me... there were a few other hikers there and as it ended up... one of them was being picked up by his wife for a while and Captain America was going to get a ride into Glasgow... so I asked if I could get a ride and that was way cool... within 5 minutes she had arrived and we were on our way. Had I arrived just 10 minutes later I would have missed the ride and had to try to hitch into town... Thank you for the ride!
As I walked to the shelter... a grey bearded hiker came into view... Subman was there with Suds... That made it double worth it to get into town...
I took a hot shower and got on clean clothes, layed out my tent in the sun to dry out... hung my sleeping bag on a clothes line to dry out some and then went over for dinner at Scotto's with Subman, Suds, AK and a few other hikers... I'm really bad with names...
I ended up getting a philly cheese steak instead of a pizza. The food at Scotto's was really good and I would recommend it to anyone in the area...
After dinner I went to the grocery store to get a few snacks for the trail and went back to the shelter... 
Glasgow is an amazing town. Very hiker friendly with a ""free"" shelter in town, a shower with hot water, electricity in the shelter and Scotto's, a grocery store and library with wifi all near by!","Cornelius Creek Shelter

Papa Monkey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531182,"Plans change again... instead of the 15 or so miles to Reservoir Rd. Campsite with a short day into Buena Vista for a zero I ended up deciding to push into Buena Vista with AK after a 21.8 mile day... We made it up the big climb in the hot sun and got to Punchbowl Shelter for a quick lunch break and water refill. The pond was a nice view but I could only imagine the flies and mosquitoes which would be near. Subman and Suds arrived shortly after we did and they decided to hold up there. They didn't think they could make the next shelter before the rain started... AK and I thought we'd just go to US 60 and head into town so for me... I didn't mind if I got rained on...I was feeling a little beat and wasn't sure I could make it to US 60 but I was up for trying... I took some extra ibuprofen and we set out. At the first road crossing there was a car with some hikers who were heading off trail for a little while to attend a wedding.. they were doing trail magic. Chick fil a chicken fingers and a can of beer... not a bad combo... I didn't really want the beer so passed initially... AK didn't drink beer but took it and put it in his pack... then a short while down the trail... i felt bad he'd be carrying it all the way so I drank it for him!  and put the empty can back in his pack for him!!! :D   At least I lightened his load a little.... LOL After the cold beer... I started hiking faster and pushing the pace for a little while... we were all moving fast and making good time.... I stopped to get some water and AK passed me up and then we just kept going... It started to rain when we were about 4 miles from US 60/ 2 miles from the shelter... AK asked if I was still up for going into town... I assured him I was in... and we moved out down the trail again. Surprisingly we arrived at the shelter pretty quickly... I kept going but AK stopped to check out the shelter. I wasn't sure if he would stop or keep going but I knew I was going into town to dry out so I kept moving... A little while later as I was trying to zip up my packa front... AK flew by me... and I was like... screw it... and just left the packa open and followed him...The rain started coming down really hard and the skys were very dark. Lightening was popping all around and I could hear the roar of the thunder even with my headphones on loudly...Of course the nice easy level trail had to turn up hill for the last mile of so to end the day... and when we finally arrived at US 60 to try to catch a ride... guess what??? Yeah... the rain stopped and the sun started to come out! Char!!!We tried to hitch for a little while... maybe 30 seconds or so.... then AK saw a name / number on a sign to call for a ride... It was only $15 so $5 each for the 3 of us and we just called ""Gary"" for a ride. He showed up when he said he would and took us into town to our hotel... Not a bad day all things considered....","Glasgow, VA Shelter
