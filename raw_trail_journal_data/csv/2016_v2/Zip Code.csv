Tore the meniscus on my right knee in November and elected not to have surgery. I have some pain in the knee area but it is mostly just discomfort. This trip to the Appalachian trail at this time of the year has become an annual event for me as I really enjoy meeting the hikers who are starting out on their long journey. I will take the midnight train to Georgia and from there go to the Hiker Hostel. I want to congratulate 2015 thru hikers Rockboat, Airlock, and Cambo. And, also want to congratulate 2012 thru hiker Sprinkles, AKA Trophy Wife. Enjoyed reading your journals.The mountains are the marrow of the world. They are some of God's finest sculpturings. -Del Gue",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Wed",0

Zip Code,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521798,"Plan to use the same gear that I used last year. Would like to upgrade some of the gear but the things I would like to upgrade to are too expensive. To see the gear I will be using, on the left side of this journal click on 2014, then click on gear. About the only change to that gear list is I will be using the Osprey 58 backpack. Time to go work out and try to get in shape for this adventure.The mountains are the marrow of the world. They are some of Gods finest sculpturings. -Del Gue",,View Entry,"Feb 25, Thu",0
Zip Code,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522796,"Have been going to the YMCA about 3 times a week and walking on the treadmill. Sometimes I try to walk for speed and at other times on an incline hopefully to get me ready for the trail. I did find the time last week to get on a local trail with my pack (not fully loaded) and hike about 6 miles. Half of the time on the trail was spent talking to day hikers about the AT, but it was a lot of fun even if I didn't go as far as I wanted. The weather this week is supposed to be nice so hopefully I can spend more time outside on the trail rather than inside at the YMCA. The mountains are the marrow of the world. They are some of God's finest sculpturings. -Del Gue",,View Entry,"Mar 07, Mon",0
