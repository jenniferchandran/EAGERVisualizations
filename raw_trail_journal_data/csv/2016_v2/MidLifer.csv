MidLifer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515006,"Well, this is my very first entry on this endeavor and I am pretty stoked about the trip! Spent the past week studying gear options, thoughts, and philosophies and I think world peace may be easier than picking the right gear without backpacking experience. None the less, I am pretty excited about the REI garage sale tomorrow and scooping up some great deals on what I am sure will be the right equipment for me! As of this entry the only people that have any clue I am doing this are the kind associates at the Greensboro REI that have seen me every day for the past week with my notes and questions by the bucket load. Once I have a firmer plan for how to do this then I will tell my family and friends they will have to spend next summer without me! If you have any words of wisdom to share that would help I would love to hear them. Cheers,Finding Nemo",,Information overload,"Oct 02, Fri",0

MidLifer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515122,"The upside to REI moving the Garage sale back a week is I have more time to research equipment options and compile a top 3 for each big ticket item like packs, tents, sleeping bags and pads, and the like. I have listed some options below, any feedback would be great!BackpacksOsprey Exos 58, Osprey Aether 70, Osprey Volt 75, REI Crest Trail 70TentsBig Agnes Scout Plus UL 2, BA Scout Plus footprint, REI Quarterdome 2, SD Flashlight 2 FLSleeping bagsREI Igneo, REI Lumen, North Face Cat's MeowSleeping PadsREI AirRail 1.5, Therma-rest Evo LiteCheers,",,Gathering info,"Oct 03, Sat",0
MidLifer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515127,I made my first purchase tonight that will be a critical part of this journey. I will need lots of resources along the way however none seems more important than a complete trail guide!,,First purchase,"Oct 03, Sat",0
MidLifer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515370,"One bit of apprehension over my decision to hike the AT was telling my family, particularly my parents. Tonight that hurdle was crossed and I was greeted with support and a little bit of an are you crazy vibe! Perfectly understandable as walking 2180 miles carrying the weight of a 10'year old is a little nuts. None the less, my plan is out in the ether for all to judge and converse about. Another step of towards the miles of preparation complete.Cheers,",,The word is out!,"Oct 07, Wed",0

MidLifer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515532,"I have looked forward to this day and I made the most of it. I picked up my #1 pack choice, Oprey Atmos AG 65, an ENO singlenest, Sawyer Squeeze, DoubleZ sleep pad, for 50% off and a micro towel and compression bag for 70% off. The gear pile is growing and I still have some coupons and the like to use with another garage sale coming in January. I will do my first shake down day hike next week and will update after that.Cheers,",,REI garage sale!,"Oct 10, Sat",0
MidLifer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516001,"I ventured out on my first overnight trip covering 15 miles from Carvers Gap to 19E with an overnight stay at Bradley Gap. I learned a few things carrying 36 pounds that far. 1. I don't want to carry more than 30lbs on my thru hike. 2. I have plenty of work to do on my conditioning, my calves have never hurt like they did once I was off the trail. 3. I loved being on the trail and meeting the other hikers, hat a great community. Already looking forward to my next trip. Cheers,",,my first overnighter,"Oct 18, Sun",0
