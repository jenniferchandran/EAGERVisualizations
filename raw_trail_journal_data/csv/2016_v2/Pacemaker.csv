Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537295,"Hello all! This post marks the beginning of a trail journal career and a distance hiking career. This summer I will be taking about 6 weeks to leisurely hike the Virginia section of the AT sobo from Harper's ferry to damascus. The hike is part of an internship with the Appalachian Trail Outreach Ministry and Appalachian Trail Chaplaincy of the Holston Conference of the UMC. All that being said, I'm thinking of this as another stroll through the woods. I'm looking forward to seeing some new parts of my home state as well as familiar paths. I'm also excited to meet some new people, many of whom will be nobo to Katahdin . I hope to one day join them. For now though, I'll start small and hopefully provide some encouragement to my fellow hikers on their own journey. A couple of weeks out, I'm about to embark on a couple of days for testing out gear and food with Short stop. I'm looking forward to a 2x thru veteran giving me some advice.   Until later, Nathan",,View Entry,"Jun 08, Wed",0
Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537832,"Ahead of my SB hike through VA beginning in less than two weeks, I took a warm up hike of sorts with ""short stop"" and ""brother baldy"". They are both older hikers with more experience than me, short stop having hiked the at twice in the last 4 years. We took a route from Watauga Lake, TN to Damascus, VA, such that I wouldn't have overlap once I begin my hike. We had a pleasant walk from the shook branch rec area to the first open shelter being the vandeventer shelter. Here, we set up camp early and visited with other hikers as they came and went. I set up my tarp and the other two set up their tents. We met quite a few other hikers and chatted before making dinner. Short stop and brother baldy turned in early and I visited with the 5 hikers staying at the shelter, all of whom are younger than me. I guess I am an old man now.",,"Vandeventer shelter, 435.9 nb","Jun 09, Thu",9.10
Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538861,"On the second day of the warm-up section to Damascus, we hiked to the Double Spring Shelter. The fact that our tents were set up on a slope near the Vandeventer Shelter led to quite a slippery, restless night. In my tarp, I woke several times to my feet being outside of the tarp as I slid downhill. Needless to say, it was a night with a lot of noise of sleeping bags sliding on tarps and tents. Despite the lack of sleep, I think the sheer excitement of being in the woods backpacking again provided the adrenaline needed to get up early. After a breakfast of an instant breakfast drink, we began hiking through the green, overgrown trail. After a couple hours of pleasant walking, we stopped for lunch at the Iron Mountain shelter before continuing on to Double Spring. There, we set up our tents on the ridge with a group of three section hiking women and their dog. We spent a lot of time talking with these fellow short section hikers before we all retired for sleep, this time on a flat tentsite.",,Double Spring Shelter,"Jun 10, Fri",14.40
Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538862,"The final day of our warm-up hike, Short Stop, Brother Baldy, and I had a leisurely breakfast with the intent of hiking another shorter day, pitching camp about 5 miles from Damascus. The women and dog camping with us left before us, as did most of the folks sleeping down the hill at the shelter (except for a group of 3 guys who seem to enjoy a later start). The walk was nice, with a few nice pastures and ridge walks. The highlight was the number of church youth group backpackers we passed (all from Florida). We spent a few minutes here and there chatting with the kids as we walked. After lunch at the Abingdon Gap shelter with ""J3"", we went on towards Damascus. A few miles out, we realized that we were making good time. The temptation of real food, a shower, and a bed after three days of hot, sunny hiking was too much to resist. Shortstop decided that I should have a hostel experience on our warm-up, so we made it to Damascus to the Hiker Hostel were we got showers, did laundry, and then went to dinner down the street. It was certainly nice to get a shower after a few days hiking. We got breakfast the next morning before heading out of town and ending the trip. The trip was certainly a fun one, and an opportunity to meet some cool hikers and a chance to get a trail name myself. I look forward to passing these nobo-thru hikers when I head south (Cairn and friend, Cowboy, J3, Rocketman, and others....)",,Damascus,"Jun 11, Sat",18.50
Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539269,"""It's a pleasure to hike, isn't it?"" was the cheerful response I received from a hiker when I greeted him with a ""morning, how's it going?"" His response seems only fitting. I'm beginning a several week hike on the Appalachian trail and one of the first hikers I meet reminds me that it is a pleasure to hike and a gift to even be walking out here. The ability to put one foot in front of the other is in and of itself a gift. To be awake and alive is a gift. I hope I can not take that for granted this hike. As for the details of today: I left the econo lodge with a big breakfast before hitting the trail around a little before 8. I made really good time and passed over 50 thru hikers. Some were talkative and others not so much. I had a chance to talk to a few but most were keen on moving onwards either to Harper's ferry or one of the hostels over here. I got to the shelter for the night around 5 and slowly set up camp. I hung a bear line properly and set up the tent: deluxe model 2.0 since I left my old tarp at home and because I now have mosquito net for the opening. I filtered some water and began to make dinner when icey showed up. We talked quite a bit over dinner while the other guests, a couple, did their own thing. Then it's bedtime with another big day tomorrow. Icey recommends the shelter 20 miles up. I think I'll give it a try. Good day on the trail! It's a pleasure to hike.","Harper's Ferry ATC

Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539437,"It's a mighty rocky road...I began singing sacred harp on Tuesday nights in new Haven this winter/spring. Amidst all the judgment songs is the mighty rocky road.  I remember nothing of this peppy little tune except the chorus: ""it's a mighty rocky road,  I'm almost done traveling, a mighty rocky road,  I'm almost done traveling, a mighty rocky road I'm almost done traveling...."" and then I couldn't remember the final line.  Something about joining Jesus I think. It's another one of those songs about leaving this earth for heaven.  This morning in the rain,  I was traveling a mighty rocky trail at the southern half of the ""roller coaster"". As I slipped and slid,  I couldn't help but despise the mighty rocky trail.  Yet,  I don't think despising the bumpy trail is a way to get anywhere.  Those bumps are part of it.  It's my response,  perhaps,  which matters more. Today I kept going and regained some speed in the afternoon after a dreadfully slow morning.  It's a mighty rocky road, and though I'm far from being done traveling,  I certainly think and hope that it's bringing me to something.  I can't remember the final line of the hymn,  and I do not know the final line of my hike's chorus but maybe in time I'll discover it. As for the hiking details: there were some pretty heavy storms early early in the morning well before dawn which continued as I got up around 630. The tent 2.0 did well, with the slight exception that the lack of tension allowed water to seep inside as well as on the side where the two edges meet.  My pack got a little wet on one side,  as did everything on that side. My sleeping pad also got wet.  I packed up and made breakfast in the rain,  trying to dry things as I went by laying them out on the covered picnic table.  After a super slow clean up,  I hit the trail around 815. The first couple of hours I was still in the roller coaster,  an area of constant ups and downs.  It was quite rocky and super slick in the rain as a result.  around 10 the rain stopped but the ultra high humidity remained all day.  I picked up some speed as the day went,  but never having dried out I called it a day a shelter early at the manassas gap shelter.  I'm glad I did as a late arriving hiker informed me he left the other because it got overrun by loud high school kids.  I'm sleeping in the shelter tonight for a new experience.  We'll see how it goes.  Off to the mountain home hostel tomorrow.  I hope to arrive by lunch so I can do laundry and then get banjo strings in town.  The laundry is mostly for the socks....both pairs are drenched and won't dry in the humidity.  I might add a third after Shenandoah when I near home.  Until next time,  it's a pleasure to hike, isn't it?","Sam Moore Shelter

Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540370,"After a couple of rainy days, I came to a hostel in Front Royal where I could shower, dry out, do laundry, and pick up a food resupply they were holding. Upon arriving, I was greeted by a NOBO thru hiker who was staying at the hostel for a week recovering from a tendon injury before determining if he could continue to Maine. Through our great conversations outside in the (for once) sunny weather, to conversations over dinner in the evening, this hiker and I often returned to a phrase he uttered frequently, ""I guess it's all a matter of perspective."" His hike was a ten year plan in the making, like so many long awaited hikes. Though, it became urgent after a ""near death"" experience. The hike became more important, but at the end of the day, he said it was just a hike. ""It's a matter of perspective."" Walking in the woods, away from the stresses of a routine pattern of life changes my perspective. What bcomes most important are the people I love, who I no longer am around. I reflect upon the housemates who I will no longer share a space with. I reflect upon my faith and the was it has evolved in the last three years. I reflect upon what matters to me. (hint: It's not decreasing my start to finish biscuit making process down from 47 minutes nor is it perfectly quoting United Methodist Eucharistic documents to a Board of Ordained Ministry.) If nothing else, hiking helps to put things in perspective. Travel details: I got up early after sleeping in a shelter for the first time, mostly because of fear of rain. A text from mom let me know she was visiting my sister in Alexandria and would be traveling home in the morning. Our paths would be so close, I asked if she would want to meet for lunch in Front Royal. I hiked a quick and early 11 miles, got to the hostel, took a shower and put on loaner clothes, and waited for mom to arrive. It was great to have a break from the pattern of hiking as we played tourist in Front Royal, did laundry, went on an unsuccessful search for replacement strings for the broken strings on my mini banjo, and got a book for me to read on the trail. After an afternoon, mom headed the rest of the way home and I returned to the hostel, made my dinner, and visited with the other two hikers and the owner of the hostel. She gave us a tour of the historic mansion they are turning into a B&B, and informed us how the hostel building was both a former slave quarters and the former county courthouse. History can be quite odd.","Manassas Gap Shelter

Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540372,"Chaplaincy sometimes gets a bad reputation as ""just listening"". Sometimes, the work is listening, and sometimes it's more. Today, my work was listening. First, I listened as I passed a trail chaplain who tried to convince me that I would not be saved until I was baptized in the Spirit, not just the water. When I told him in my tradition we believe baptism is by water and the spirit, he was unconvinced. Realizing that an argument would not be fruitful, I listened as he spouted scripture and his theology to me. And then he prayed for me. I think he appreciated somebody actually hearing him out. He decided that maybe I was saved after all. Then, my listening continued at the shelter. After a relatively easy day, with the light rain giving way to sun in the afternoon, I spent a lot of time reading on some cliffs, joined by two women around my age hiking on the trail. We had all sorts of CT and MA connections! We all wandered to the shelter in the late afternoon where there was a crowd of 7 of us. Two weekend backpackers were there. The two men were retired Army Veterans who served in Vietnam. The evening, well later than my normal 2115 bedtime, consisted largely of them telling stories to me and the women. Stories of Vietnam, of training, of Alaskan adventures, of near death parachuting accidents. Of losing companions. We hardly spoke other than a brief remark or question here or there. Telling our stories sometimes seems to make them matter more. Sometimes I think our stories help us to matter more. And I was honored to ""just listen"".The details: The day was an easy one as I am already ahead of my food drop schedule based on 15-mile days. So, I sat on the rocks of Mount Marshall shortly after entering Shenandoah National Park and read from my new book for a while and had quite a relaxing day, filled with conversations with other passerbys at the overlook. I even met former United Methodist ""Trail Chaplains"". I pitched my tent near the shelter. So far, Shenandoah bear count is at 0.","Mountain Home

Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540373,"All the hikers I passed prior to entering Shenandoah National Park told me about all the bears I would find in Shenandoah. I was excited. Their bear counts were in the teens through the park. I hiked off and on through the day with a fellow southbound section hiker. As we flip-flopped throughout the day due to various breaks we both took, we saw 3 bears. I saw 0. Everybody was seeing bears and I have not. It kind of makes me question my attentiveness to my surroundings. So far, I have felt more attentive to the natural surroundings as I hike than most hikers I pass. Most have headphones in an listen to music, podcasts, or audiobooks as they walk. Many do not take any side trails to vistas, as where I take most side trails. Yet, I haven't seen any bears. Maybe I'm not giving my fellow hikers enough credit in their walking. It makes me think back to my preschool-teaching days of undergrad, when the most distracted and antsy student was the one who remembered our story time the best. It's always good to be reminded how my assumptions can be wrong. The hike: No bears, but snakes. Hiking with another hiker shortly after leaving the shelter after breakfast, we encountered a 5+ foot rattlesnake on the side of the trail. The snake rattled and would not budge despite our coaxing, gentle rock tosses, and retreat. We eventually had to detour around it on the road, before continuing our hike. After a nice lunch break at one of the park bathroom/parking areas, I took a little sink shower and visited with a few thru hikers for a few hours before climbing up to Mary's Rock and enjoying the first purely sunny day on the trail. After sitting and reading on the rock, I left for the shelter. I was the first day and decided to be lazy and stay in the shelter. 5 of us ended up there together and had dinner and conversation about ultralight backpacking and ultramarathons (4 of us had run them). It was a pleasant evening with a nice cool breeze on the ridgeline with a beautiful sunset. A ridgeline shelter is a rare luxury on the trail.","Gravel Springs Hut

Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540374,"I never would have predicted that I would feel bored on the trail, but I do. Many days, the trail is in deep woods with few vistas and I just walk. My routine is breakfast, walk, granola break, walk, lunch/water filter break, walk, get to camp, dinner, talk, bed. The majority of my day is walking. And today, I hardly passed any hikers. I had no good conversations with hikers. The few I passed were hurrying, trying to beat the rain we all new was returning in the afternoon. For the first time, I got really frustrated with the trail. Walking all day everyday gets old, fast. Perhaps the thru hiking life is not for me. Maybe it's the matter of perspective, but today just felt like walking. A few years ago at a monastery in Spain, a monk told me that anything can be prayer if you allow it to be. I try to always remember that. Today's walking did not feel at all prayerful. I will work on that. Details: I saw bears!!! Finally, I saw a bear and a half today. Not actually half a bear, but I got a full look at a cub before it ran from me. Then a half mile or so later, a glimpsed a bear just as it ran out of view at a distance. Hence, the bear and a half. At least I don't feel completely unobservant now. After hiking in the fog and dense humidity all day with little interaction with other hikers, I arrived at the buggy shelter just as the rain began to fall. I decided to sleep in the shelter yet again for convenience sake. After setting up my pad and bag, I left the shelter to wander another mile up the trail to the campsite store to pick up my next food box. I had some nice conversations with the workers and other hikers at the store before returning to the buggy hut in the ravine. The mysterious knot on my ankle became more sore today, so I'll keep an eye on that as well as the increasingly annoying blisters. Just a part of hiking I suppose. I had some nice conversations with hikers at the hut about the trail community before watching the owls fly in the opening in front of the shelter. My companions went to bed as I watched for another hour as the late arriving hikers showed up around 2200. I can't quite understand night hiking yet I guess. I hated it the time I did that in New Hampshire.....","Byrd's Nest #3 Shelter

Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540376,"I decided to hike big miles today and tomorrow. in order to make it to Rockfish Gap by Wednesday evening. Mom could not meet me Thursday morning, but I want to switch out my boots for my trail running shoes to see if it helps with the blisters. My feet just move too much in the boots. But, in order to make Rockfish Gap, my 22-mile days need to be two 27-mile days instead. But, I have yet to stop at the roadside ""waysides"" in Shenandoah National Park to get a legendary blackberry milkshake. I decided to wait for the final one at Loft Mountain as an act of self-control. I also decided that milkshake would be a good reward for a 27 mile day. I hiked through the hottest and most humid day on the trail from 0700, anticipating a cold milkshake reward. About two miles shy of the milkshake stand at 5pm, I was informed by a passing hiker that the stand closes at 5pm and that I missed the milkshakes. Disappointed, the weather joined me in darkness as a storm arrived simultaneously. I climbed the final two miles uphill in the rain, disappointed, hot, and with an increasingly agitated ankle. Upon reaching the campground at the top of Loft Mountain, though, I met two other hikers as we congregated near the coin-operated showers sipping our cold gatorades (the next best treat I could find). They invited me to join them at their campsite, reducing the cost to $5 a piece. Exhausted, hot, wet, and disappointed, I agreed. We then had a wonderful conversation after everybody took showers, about hiking. These teachers from Texas were not your usual hikers and had no agenda. We'll just hike until one of us gets tired of it, they said. We sat and talked and visited with our campsite neighbors into the night, while the sounds of fiddle music floated over from a distant campsite. My disappointing day ended up as one of the more pleasant evenings on the trail. I can't wait until I get home and complete my banjo string resupply so I can play music again.

Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540377,"Despite increasing soreness in my ankle (I might have to get that looked at when home), I made some good time hiking today. I was hiking at an almost 4mph pace! I also passed few hikers until late in the day. One, though, was Cold Turkey, the full time trail chaplain this year for the Appalachian Trail Chaplaincy! We knew of each other but had never met. However, our long awaited meeting occurred right on the trail about 5 miles north of Rockfish Gap. We talked about our experiences on the trail, and spoke of the expected and unexpected challenges of both hiking the trail and doing ministry on the trail. It was really nice to make the physical connection with the trail chaplain. I do not envy that job as much anymore. The trail is quite an undertaking and with the recent rain almost every day, downright demoralizing at times. However, Cold Turkey seems to be powering through the challenges. My prayers are certainly with him. After passing a few more snakes today (snake count:7, deer count: 7, bear count: 3), I arrived in Rockfish Gap early to meet mom. We grabbed dinner (where we had to sit outside due to my hiker aroma) and then headed for home. It'll be good to be home for a couple of days to change out shoes, get a break, and see if this ankle gets better.","Loft Mountain Campground

There's a lot of hurt and pain and divorce on the trail. Both of my fellow card playing hikers tonight spoke of their divorces and ex spouses. Most intriguing though was one asking me if I knew why God made mountains. I thought it was the punchline of a joke but he then said, ""it's written in the bible somewhere right?"" I confessed I don't think it ever says. ""I'm not religious, but I thought they were to challenge us ."" Perhaps he's right. I don't know. Mountains certainly bring challenge, wonder, awe among other things, but I don't know why they were made. Maybe I'll have an answer to update in the morning. As for the logistical things, my ankle swelling was diagnosed as Lyme disease and I'm back on doxycycline. I've played this game before so no big deal. I got back on the trail today in my running shoes and it feels better. I walked a short 5 miles this afternoon and then read and visited with the other hikers (all weekend folks).

Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541383,"TRAIL MAGIC! Some of you reading this are quite familiar with trail magic, while others have no clue what I'm talking about. I'm not talking about magic tricks (though I did encounter a hiker today who was trying to entertain us with tricks at the shelter). ""Trail Magic"" is an occurrence of unexpected kindness from a complete stranger to hikers, often in the form of food, beverages, rides, etc. I had my first true taste of trail magic today. On a gray day of hiking with a dense fog present all day and a light drizzle throughout, I passed through Reid's (Reed's) Gap on the Blue Ridge Parkway to find Ewok, a 2012 thru-hiker, sitting by his car with music playing and an array of food on a towel: beer, ice cream, apples, bananas, mangos, avocados, cherries, mixed nuts, and candy bars. After protesting slightly as unworthy to receive as a non-thru hiker, Ewok insisted. I took some fruit and a snickers bar and talked with my new hiker friend for a while, exchanging stories about the trail, Virginia, and travels. Ewok's friends who had asked to help out with his trail magic then showed up and began a 4th of July cookout (a day early). I ended up spending about 4 hours with Ewok and crew, eating homemade potato salad, burgers, strawberries, and more of Ewok's cherries. After a dreary and drizzly day, I couldn't have imagined a better experience for my first trail magic. I needed the pick-me-up....and I think Ewok and friends needed an appreciative, listening visitor.I got up to the sound of rain, continuing from most of the previous night. Thankfully the shelter was a nice one. I continued to talk to the 4 others at the site over breakfast, but took my time getting ready since I was in no rush to be anywhere as I'm wasting time in order to meet a Trail Chaplaincy Board member for a hike in a few days. I waited until the rain let up and then began my hike up Humpback Mountain in the fog and misting/drizzling rain, which continued all day. Thus, the beautiful views along the parkway were nothing but fog. Oh well. At least I saw another bear! And, I ran into Cowboy, a hiker I met in Tennessee in June! We had a brief rendezvous, but he was anxious to get out of the rain and into Waynesboro (the big destination in this part of the trail). I arrived to Maupin field and visited with my 4 other sheltermates: a thru hiker, a long weekend couple, and a long weekend Marine. We had some nice conversation about jobs, the military, hiking, and church before calling it a night as the rain picked up yet again.","Paul Wolfe Shelter

Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543139,"""Remember your baptism and be thankful"" repeated through my mind as I ascended The Priest today, one of the longer Virginia climbs on a Southbound (SOBO) hike through Virginia on the AT. The baptism reminder seemed only fitting given the mountain's name being ""The Priest"". It was further appropriate due to the weather. Shortly after descending the rocky Three Ridges peak in a drizzle, the sky opened up into an all out downpour. This rain continued for the next couple of hours: enough time to reach the summit of The Priest, almost perfectly. This was the type of rain which relentlessly soaks to one's very core. As I hiked upward on the manageable, but steady climb, my attitude changed from disgust to amusement. Being so soaked that each step causes bubbles in the trail/spontaneous creek given the fact that the water was above my ankles forced me to chuckle. The more I hiked, I found myself enjoying the waters, the refreshing and renewing water of the rain. It felt like a baptism. ""Remember your baptism and be thankful,"" I began to think. I was hardly thankful for the rain, but felt a renewed sense of mission. Hiking the Appalachian Trail as an intern trail chaplain is ministry. And baptism, among its many meanings, is a commissioning to ministry of sorts. I needed that reminder from The Priest today.For the details, in no need of rushing onward due to the Friday rendezvous near Buchanan with a Trail Chaplaincy board member, I waited to leave the shelter until the rain took a break. After a leisurely breakfast and conversation with the fellow hikers and the Tye River Ridge Runner (a trail employee), I began the drizzly/foggy walk up Three Ridges, down to the Tye River, and back up The Priest. These climbs, two of the more notorious in Virginia should have been accompanied by beautiful views due to their height (~4000 ft) and rocky outcroppings. Sadly, though, I was surrounded by a dense fog, high winds, and rain on both peaks, with no view beyond a few feet. Further, I passed 5 day hikers out for a 4th of July walk, but no other hikers during my hike. I got to the Priest Shelter on the summit around 2pm, completely soaked. I decided to stop for a little while at least and found 7 other hikers doing the same. Some eventually moved onward, but four of us decided to stay for the day despite the rain letting up. I ate my patriotic military issued MRE (from the previous day's trail magic) and visited with my fellow hikers (two thru-hikers and a fellow SOBO section hiker). It was an odd, wet, and pleasant 4th of July.","Maupin Field Shelter

I stopped for a food resupply at 3 Springs Hostel near Buena Vista today, and was greeted by the owner and her upper elementary aged grandson. While she was preparing for their departure to town for errands, the grandson and I began talking as I repacked my pack with new food. ""When I grow up, I want to hike the whole Appalachian Trail"", he told me. ""Really? The whole thing?"" He nodded and smiled. ""That's quite a goal."" ""I think I can do it. I'll be ready and I'll be bigger then."" As we talked for a few more minutes I began to think of my hike, by this point getting a little old. The routine of waking and walking in rain (lighter but still present today) was hardly something I was enjoying. And yet, it was this child's dream. He dreamed of doing the exact thing I was doing at that moment, except more. Maybe I should try to appreciate it a little more, for him if nothing else.The day began in as dense of a fog as I've had so far. It almost felt like night in some of the dense groves of trees. In fact, I think I even saw a coyote wandering around confused about the time of day. Almost perfectly, though, the fog lifted and the sun came out right as I reached the meadows of Cold (Cole) Mountain, my favorite place on the AT that I've ever hiked. I took advantage of the sunshine and sat on the summit for a while, talking with family (there's actually cell service there!) and giving my wet feet and gear a chance to dry a bit. I had been informed earlier that the meetup near Buchanan had been postponed so I was given the green light to pick up the pace as I wished. It felt good to hike a few more hours today, though the rain is starting to wear on my feet and soul alike.","The Priest Shelter

Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543143,"Near the top of Bluff Mountain, between Buena Vista and Big Island, there is a marker on the side of the Appalachian Trail as a memorial to Little Ottie Cline Powell, a child whose body was found at that ""exact spot"" in 1891 after disappearing from school more than 7 miles away 5 months earlier. My dad had long told me about finding a marker for Little Ottie Cline Powell in that area many years ago, but he could never remember exactly where. Sometimes the monotony of the trail makes it feel as if it's another world entirely. Markers like this one, or the tale of the Brown Mountain Creek community (an early freed slave community) serve as good reminders that these hills and trees and rocks are not another world, but have in fact been a part of history in this very world for some time. Some of those rocks or trees may have been present to the goings on of the community, or some may have even served as witnesses to the life of Little Ottie Cline Powell. After a brief prayer, I left the marker and continued in a much more somber mood. I had my first truly solo shelter night last night. Nobody else ever arrived at the Brown Mountain Creek Shelter. Given the looming clouds, I slept in the shelter yet again, but not until after spending some quality time reading and playing my mini banjo. After a quick breakfast, I began hiking into a hot and humid day of climbing, back up and over the Blue Ridge Parkway to Bluff mountain and along the ridge until I descended towards the James River near Big Island. The trail was largely empty today, though I passed a handful of late through hikers before meeting a gentlemen out hiking for the week, his first backpacking trip in 30 years. Sharing in his experience and his first day on the trail since his youth was a really special time. We visited for a while before he retreated to his tent to work and I moved on to the next shelter. I crossed the James River Bridge (the longest footbridge on the trail) before getting to the Matts Creek Shelter. I arrived before 4pm, but given the climb and distance to the next shelter, I decided to call it a day early with a ""bath"" in the swimming hole and a lot of reading with my feet in the cool creek waters.

Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543147,"""I'm hiking home"". ""Where is home?"" ""Massachusetts."" I took a Snicker's bar break at the Bryant Ridge Shelter this afternoon and there were two older hikers there. One was a woman who began in Georgia in March and is trying to make Harper's Ferry by the end of August. She just hikes a few miles a day but enjoys being outside in retirement. The other was a gentleman who is from Massachusetts. Last summer he had a friend drop him at the trail in Massachusetts and he hiked south to Georgia where some other retired friends picked him up. He lived with them over the winter and is now back on the trail to go home to Massachusetts. I asked if he ever intended to hike the New England portion of the trail to finish it. He said, ""No. I don't have any friends up there."" Most of the hikers care about how far one goes, whether one makes the whole trail or not. This gentleman was hiking to get from one place to another. ""I'm not in a rush to get places."" I've said from the beginning that there are all sorts of people on the trail, but that took on a whole new meaning today when I met a commuter on the trail. That's quite a way to get where you're going.As for the details, I got up later than planned from the shelter and didn't get on the trail until almost 9. In a light morning drizzle I climbed up Apple Orchard mountain, reaching the summit by early afternoon with now sunny skies. From the climb up Apple Orchard, I had some beautiful views to the west from the Parkway. Most of the trail was densely wooded, today, though. I passed a few shelters today, hoping to get enough miles to make it to Daleville tomorrow to meet Alan for a resupply and to meet mom for a night at home (read: shower and laundry). I took a lunch break at one shelter and a snicker's break at another before deciding that my feet had enough walking around 6pm at the Jennings Creek crossing near Buchanan. I set up my tarp in a large tenting area near the creek. After dinner, reading, and getting my sleeping pad bag (also my rock bag for bear bag purposes) stuck in the tree, I called it a night. I hope that I won't need to patch my sleeping pad, because the patches were in the bag I had to cut in the tree. :/","Matts Creek Shelter

Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543148,"Back to the Sacred Harp Singing, I was so excited for laundry and a shower at home that I found myself singing variations of ""I have but one more river to cross"" today. This is another Sacred Harp tune expressing the desire to reach the heavenly home of rest, but for me I decided that I was excited to reach my own home of rest. It became a counting song as I moved from about 5 more rivers to cross to just one and then ""no more"". It helps the time to pass on the rolling ridge walks like today to sing of some progress being made when each ridge looks alike. Maybe that's the reason the hymn was written in the first place. The community might have felt as if their lives of faith were taking them nowhere. Creating a life milestone countdown made the hurdles and obstacles of life seem more meaningful in their passing, perhaps. At least they were getting somewhere. When they had but one more river to cross, they had almost made it to heaven. I got up early after a restless night of sleep given I could hear noises all night. Upon emerging from my tarp at first light, I realized that the noises were from a gentleman who had set up his hammock adjacent to my tarp in the middle of the night, despite the room for probably 30 tents at the site. When I began to pack up, he woke and began to visit with me. As we talked over my breakfast and packing, we moved from conversation about backpacking gear to his ongoing divorce. Whenever I stopped my chores to look at him, he'd change the subject back to my gear. But, when talking while occupied in other matters, he told me all about his divorce, his job, and his coping with life's unpleasantness in the current. I slowed my chores and we talked for almost an hour until he packed up to leave himself (his car was parked nearby). I offered continuing prayers for him before leaving for a big day of hiking. Recognizing a late start on a day that I had to make Daleville by 5:30 with a dead phone and no way of knowing the time, I took off up Cove Mountain in a power walk. I passed just a handful of hikers during the day, so my pace continued to quicken. I eventually reached the Fullhardt Knob Shelter where my view west revealed darkening storm clouds. I practically trail ran down the mountain to Troutville and Daleville where I sat down at 3 Lil Pigs Barbeque, plugged in my phone, and realized it was only 4:30! I had made great time! I drank about 8 Sierra Mists and downed most of a table serving of BBQ Nachos before Alan, Mary, and Mom arrived for dinner. We had a great dinner and then I got to go home for laundry and a shower!","Jennings Creek

Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547308,"After a night at home, mom joined on the trail today! She will accompany me to Rt. 311 after McAfee Knob, giving us two days to hike together. After grabbing a couple of provisions and a new filter squeeze bag at the outfitter in Daleville, we took off up the trail to the nice ridge walk North of Tinker Cliffs. My feet much appreciated the slower pace, as we were only aiming for 10 miles or so each day. Having company on the trail is so much nicer than not. I think I had not really become aware of how solitary hiking by oneself all day, every day can be. Just having mom behind me even if not talking was a really pleasant treat. Plus, breaks and meals have company again. Having somebody else to interact with is not something you can take for granted on the trail. Details: The storm the night before blew down a bunch of trees along the ridge. Today's hike required lots of crawling over down limbs and trees (probably part of the reason I pulled off 4 ticks today!). We couldn't camp near Lambert's Meadow because of the continued bear problems, so we pushed onwards past Tinker Cliffs, but not before enjoying the beautiful views from the cliffs. We watched at sunset as the storm clouds blew just around us, giving us a pleasant breeze as we pitched our tents (my tarp and mom's tent) for the night.","US 220, Daleville

Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547309,"""We try to get away as much as possible"" said one of the hikers with whom I shared a small tent site. They lived in Washington D.C. and leave the city and urban/suburban lifestyle to go hiking every vacation they take. ""I can't blame you. Maybe you should move, though. Wouldn't that be nice?"", I replied. And then we all three acknowledged the same predicament: there just aren't the jobs and opportunities in rural areas. One of them was an intensive care nurse in a major hospital, the other, his partner, an immigrant from Eastern Europe. They loved to travel and have done so frequently, but did not always find opportunity or welcome in more rural locations. At least in DC, they had a good, stable income and could largely be accepted as a gay couple. In less urban places, they did not have either security. I felt bad for their situation, but they didn't seem to mind. They plan to move to another country in the future anyway. As we talked more, I found that one of them was also United Methodist. Well, he was formerly United Methodist. The same church that we both loved ceased to be hospitable to him and after advocating and praying for change from within the structures of the church, he had given up hope after suffering too many blows and left. He no longer went to a church routinely. Maybe this is another instance of ""getting away as much as possible"" from a lifestyle or church which is too overbearing. Just as they needed a break from the city, I suppose they needed a break from our church: and I can't really fault that.Details: Mom and I got up pretty early, greeted by a friendly deer. After breakfast we began the ridge walk up the steep slope to McAfee Knob. There was quite a crowd at the top for a Sunday morning. The local Ridge Runner was up there keeping an eye on things as well, having made the hike from Rt. 311 to see how the ""blow down"" cleanup efforts were going after Friday's storms. Reaching Rt. 311 in the early afternoon, mom and I went to lunch at Hardee's in Salem where we could grab food, I grabbed a light resupply, and then we got milkshakes (mom had dreamed about them the night before) before I was dropped back off at the trail. I hiked for a couple of hours until around 7pm, passing just two hikers heading north. After lovely conversation with my campsite pals, it was time to call it a night.","Tinker Cliffs

Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547313,"Occasionally the guidebook or app for the AT will indicate ruins along the trail. It will point out old foundations or outbuildings once used by inhabitants of the area. Near the spring a few hundred yards from the Sarver Hollow Shelter, were several large buildings in ruins. I am not enough of an expert to tell you what they were or when they were from, but they were certainly not indicated on the map or guide. And the three buildings (mostly foundations at this point) were located along the spring creek bed, intentionally placed there for water access I imagine. There was life in this seemingly remote location. And then, when setting up my tent, I heard more life. I heard men talking and working....on a house not 200 yards or so from the edge of the shelter's tenting area. Life, new and old, is in this valley.Details: It was a hot and humid day, with storms threatening off and on throughout the day. Luckily, though, it never rained. Yet another day without rain! After breakfast and continued conversation with my DC friends, I took off up towards Dragon's Tooth. It was a hazy day so the view was nice, but not spectacular. I took a midmorning break at the Pickle Branch Shelter for a snack and to refill on water. I had just seen a couple of not-easily-frightened bears right before the shelter, which probably led to the break being a hair quicker than it would have been otherwise. I took lunch by the Audie Murphy Monument and then wandered back down the mountain before going back up the next ridge west where I came across a couple of hikers heading for the Niday Shelter. I walked along the Eastern Continental Divide before heading down the long .3 mile side trail to the Shelter for the night. There was a father/son section hiker duo staying in the shelter. We all talked for a while about our experiences before calling it a night, hoping for no rain.","Campsite before Rawies Rest

Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547318,"In the midst of a stormy, rainy spell, I stopped for lunch at the War Spur Shelter, where there was another hiker with a similar idea. This companion on the trail told me that he began hiking Mar. 1 but quit at Mountain Crossing (the first road crossing on the trail in GA) after enduring snow the night before. However, a few weeks later, he decided to try again, feeling more determined to not quit after having told friends and family about his attempt to hike. And here he was in Virginia. He wasn't making great time and was only doing about 10 miles a day, but he was determined to at least make Harper's Ferry before his funds ran out. I asked what his plan was for after the trail to which he replied, ""I don't know. This is a whole lot better than paying bills and working, though."" I admit I get a little frustrated with the hikers who go on the trail with no future plans and no attempt to take responsibility as adults. But, perhaps this individual could make it after all. He certainly had the determination needed to succeed if you quit and begin again in the same season.Details: I woke to a light drizzle which quickly dissipated. After a quick breakfast with the father/son pair, I took off south. The morning trail took me through several open, rolling meadows. The problem is that the rain from overnight had soaked the grass, which quickly soaked my shoes. It felt as if it had just poured on my feet. After passing Keffer Oak (the biggest Oak on the southern AT), I made it to the VA 42 crossing. I had a food drop up the road one mile at a Christmas Tree farm. Sadly, I could not hitch a ride and ended up road walking up to the drop and back. This delay made me a little more determined in the next stage of hiking. I made it to the War Spur Shelter where there was a pretty torrential passing storm. I was glad to be at the shelter. After it subsided, I began hiking up the mountain with rolling thunder and drizzle around me. Coming down the ridge from Mountain Lake area, the wet rocks in the drizzle were a nightmare and frustrations became present. Instead of my usual ~3.5 miles an hour pace, I was reduced to about 1 mile per hour. Eventually, the trail got less rocky and I made it to the Pine Swamp Branch Shelter a little after 7pm. It's not quite as far as I hoped, but it's striking distance for the lunch plans in Pearisburg tomorrow. After dinner and conversation with two hikers at the shelter, we all called it a night as the rain continued to fall.","Sarver Hollow Shelter

Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547323,"The Fall. It had to happen, some argue. In order for God's plan to be enacted, in order for God's love to become realized, in order for humanity to understand Grace, in order for God to become incarnate, etc....the Fall had to happen. I always laugh at the term ""The Fall"" because it hardly seemed like an accident, and falls always seem unintentional. Maybe the repercussions were not intentional, but the action was certainly a choice. On the trail, a fall has to happen. Many hikers told me that it was only a matter of time until my first fall and I always brushed that thought aside. I'd never fallen hiking before and I couldn't imagine starting a new trend. However, as I call it, ""The Fall"" happened today. During the ridge walk towards Pearisburg, I was in a constant light rain/fog on a largely rocky trail with the large rocks which require careful footing. On one such rock, while trying to keep up speed in order to make the 12:30 lunch plans in Pearisburg and shortly after passing a bear cub, my foot slid. And down I fell. Yet, just like the biblical ""Fall"", I think I learned a bit from this. I like to think that humanity learned something from the biblical Fall. I like to think we learned what it was like to break communion with God and how disordered humanity can become. But I also think we learned that even falling from God, we continue to live. And perhaps, we live with the hope that we will make our way back to God. A fall on the trail is not the end of a hike, but something to learn from and to continue walking past.Details: After a rainy breakfast with the two other hikers, I took off up the mountain to the ridge in a constant drizzle. Eventually, the rain let up with a constant fog. After a few brief encounters with other hikers and another bear sighting, a few overgrown meadow walks, and many rocky trail segments, I eventually made it down the mountain and up the final little hill before coming back down to the New River Bridge crossing near Narrows/Pearisburg where I got picked up by Alan and taken to lunch with a pastor's group of UM clergy in Pearisburg. After our lunch at the Mexican Restaurant, given the rainy weather, I stayed with Pastor Burch at his home in Pearisburg. It was nice to get a shower, do laundry, and follow the United Methodist Southeastern Jurisdictional Conference. In the evening, I got to attend the Bible school at his church, which was fun to be around a bible school setting again.","Pine Swamp Branch Shelter

Gathered at the Wapiti shelter with a fire going in the attempt to dry all of our collectively soaked clothes and shoes, we talked about our hikes. There were 8 of us: an older couple, section hiking 4 days at a time, a mother and her two young adult sons from Quebec, a young couple from Florida, and me. The two thru-hiking NB groups were in no rush, though. Both expected to run out of time to make Katahdin in time to finish this year but were in no rush. They talked about being out on the trail for the experience of hiking and they planned to appreciate nature as their priority. One of the sons stated that while he hikes, he likes to stop to smell the roses. Then he corrected and said that he likes to photograph the roses. The young woman claimed that she wanted to smell ALL the flowers. I pride myself hiking on stopping to appreciate my surroundings. But not every step of the trail. I think that these hiking friends do, however. How different would the hike be if I stopped at every interesting detour?The Hike: I got dropped on the bridge full with a trio of Hardee's Biscuits. I walked up Angel's Rest where I had a beautiful view of Pearisburg below the fog and low-lying clouds. The weather in the morning was sunny and I was surprised to have found no other hikers other than a local boy scout troop. As the day went on, however, the clouds rolled in for scattered afternoon storms which were downright heavy at times. I stopped for the day early at the Wapiti shelter, not really feeling like pushing to the next shelter. Plus, when I arrived in the mid-afternoon, other hikers were already there with a fire going. I set up my tent and hoped for no more rain but the shelter seemed damp on its own.","Pearisburg, US 460 New River Bridge

Pacemaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547334,"For once, with enough cell reception to make it for the day until a sure recharge in the future, I left my cell phone on for a day of hiking. And much to my surprise, in the middle of the day, I got a phone call from a number I didn't know. ""Hello?"" I answered, in my usual fashion. On the other end was a familiar voice that I couldn't place. Quickly, though, the speaker identified himself as a friend, Manny, who I hadn't heard from in years. Manny joined the Army about the time I went to divinity school and after his second deployment, I never heard from him. We talked for about a half hour, me terrified of moving and losing service. We spoke about his service, my aspirations, his aspirations, meaning, family, and McDonald's (which did not fit in the above categories). In the setting of the AT, one of the greatest sorrows is the fact that while on the trail, I have lost touch with so many friends, family, and dear ones. However, having this connection reignited brought an awful lot of happiness to my hike, and makes up in an odd way for some of the lost connections. The greatest purpose of humanity, in my theology, is to form connections with other human beings. God models connection in the Trinity for us. Though broken, our human connections are our greatest earthly gifts. Having a broken connection reconnected is a joy.Details: I woke and ate a quick breakfast before taking off towards US 52 where I would be picked up to stay at Alan's house in Bland for the night. There were again passing storms throughout the day, but the hiking wasn't difficult at all. I stopped briefly to take in Dismal Falls, one of the better falls on the trail to this point. Otherwise, the day had a lot of pretty easy trail and some nice ridge walking before heading to I-77 and US-52. The blisters on my feet seem to be getting worse from all of the ceaseless rain, but I'm close enough now that I will probably power through rather than stop to treat them.","Wapiti Shelter
