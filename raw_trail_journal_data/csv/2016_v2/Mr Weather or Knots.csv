Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525974,Reached Amicola Falls Park and Ellijay today and staying in Elliay overnight. Originally was planning to start tomorrow but will wait one day so both Marilee who has to drive back to Colorado and myself starting the hike could get some much needed sleep. Rain was coming down in sheets and driving at times was slowed to 30 mph on Interstate 24 coming into Nashville. Still in panic mode on what I am bringing in weight. Righ at 37 pounds including all food and food for Riley. His pack comes in at nine pounds. Of course we had to help the local law when a domestic dispute started across the stree from our hotel. All turned out well with no arrest. So you should start seeing both my blogs and track on the Delorme map.,"Springer Mountain

Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526073,"So the journey begins. Gorgeous sunny day in the low 60s but very windy. Should have good weather for the most part of this week but night temps expected in the low 30s. Riley (Forecaster) is excited as well as he wants to chase everything that moves - including leaves and bugs in the air. Marilee heading back to Colorado. Ranger told us about bears being active and hikers are restricted from camping in one stretch unless they have all food in bear proof canisters. Well that was three pounds I choose not to carry so I will be hiking quickly through that area without stopping on Wednesday, with Riley having a bell attached to him for noise. Marilee gave me a great parting gift of a hooded SFP and wicking Appalachian Trail shirt. Will connect as Wi-Fi is available or able to talk with Marilee so she can post for me. See you all in about six months.","Amicola Falls - Appalacian Approach Trail

Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526811,"So time to catch up on the trip. Today is Thursday April 7th and I am at The Top of Georgia Hostel 9 miles from the North Carolina Border. Let go day by day to today.Saturday April 1 – Marilee and I got to the start at Amicola Falls State Park. We hike together up the Appalachian Approach Trail – without backpack - so she could enjoy a hike with me and Riley before we departed. Got the park ranger to give me a shakedown, sign me in and also give me some great advise about hiking and gear. My pack weighed in at 37 pounds without water. We spent some time at the lodge then continued hiking. The Approach Trail is 8.7 miles long with a 1300 foot climb leading to the actual start of the AT at Springer Mountain. P.S. Those Approach trail miles do not count in the total AT hike of 2184. We ended the day back at the hotel with a great dinner in a neat country town eating BBQ in Elliay Georgia. Got a good nights sleep.Sunday – April 3:We woke up and Marilee gave me a ride back where the Approach Trail ends and the AT starts. Of course we both cried as I already knew that I would miss her a lot and was grateful to know that someone in my life could support me on such a wild expedition. She is a great person with a big heart and I love her more than I show her at times. By 10 am I was ready to start hiking and she had to leave to begin the hard drive back to Colorado.The trail was a lot more than I expected and it was great. Right from the start I began hooking up with other hikers. Several were also bring their dog so that made me feel a lot more comfortable bringing Riley. First big surprise was about five miles in where all of a sudden in the trail I see a canopy tent with dozens of people waiting for me and cheering me on. They were from the Georgia Adventure Group and were there to encourage us and and also feed us. So after a couple of hot dogs, soda, chips and candy bars, Riley and I said goodbye know there are really a lot of great people in this world. Hiked along a stream until reaching the Hawk Springs shelter around 4pm after 9.2 miles. Already several dozen hikers were there and set up. Georgia portions of the trail's shelters are awesome. Set up my new camping hammock and began mingling with people. Quickly connected with several who we eventually stayed together for several days. Of course Riley was the hit of the day and everyone wanted him to stay with them. A group of housewives came in and set up next to me. They do about 1 to 2 weeks of the trail every year. I noticed one pulling out a bottle of Fireball whiskey so of course I had to rib them for carrying that weight. I also asked for a shot jokingly to which they replied no this is a girl party and no guys invited. That initiated me into the trail naming tradition. They did not have a real trail name yet and asked for suggestions. The guys I was hanging with suggested “The Real Housewives of the Appalachian Trail” and they liked it and accepted their new trail name. Nightfall came and Riley headed to bed. I into the Hammock and Riley on his pad and blanket. By 10 PM the temps began to drop and the winds picked up quickly. Riley was shaking so bad and he tried once to get into the hammock but once in decided he did not like it an fought me to get back out. I tried to cover him more but to no avail and he was freezing at temps started to approach 30 degrees. By midnight I gave up and he and I headed for the shelter that already had seven people in it. The shelters are a three sided – open face structure with a second level bunk area. They welcomed me, really Riley, so that I could snuggle and cover Riley with my sleeping bag. After about an hour Riley finally stopped shivering and we went to sleep. The guys were chatting away only to hear some paper rattling in the upper bunk. One of the hikers climbed the latter to see if is was mice – which is was- trying to chew into the backpacks for food. As he stretched from the ladder with his butt hanging out he ripped off the loudest and worst smelling fart that would clear a room. We all started laughing and decided he needed a trail name. It only took minutes to get a vote of “Stink Mouse” He tried to fight it but to no avail so it stuck. Woke up at 3pm to take a leak to a very cold and windy night with a super view of the mountain night sky and stars. At 5 am I awoke to realize that somehow Riley wiggled out of his collar so I panicked and called out. He came running back and jumped on me shivering so I grabbed him into the sleeping bag but I also smelled horse poop. As I covered him he was covered in poop but I did not care as I just wanted to warm him up. We fell asleep.Monday – April 4:Woke up to 28 degree temps but a beautiful sunrise. Today we planned to go to the next shelter 7.8 miles down the trail. Based on the day prior we all did not rush thinking this would take less than four hours. What a mistake and our first lesson of the mountains of northern Georgia. The profile showed to large climbs so off we went. After 2 hours and lots of climbing I thought we were at the 4.5 mile point called Sassifrass Gap and completed the first climb, but the guide did not match what I was seeing, especially no water source which I was running low on. Another hiker came along and informed me I had only gone 2.4 miles to Horse Gap and that Sassifrass Mountain laid ahead. WHAT !!!! So off Riley and I went on the climb. After only a few minutes Riley plopped in small pond of standing water and promptly laid down in it. I called him out but he refused to get up so I assumed his pack might be too heavy. I took it off to carry and he got back up. We crossed a stream just before the camp area. Riley immediately began running from bank to bank through the water entertaining the other campers. One of the hikers I connected with whose Trail Name was Minister took video as people never saw a dog having so much fun in the water. He was entertaining. In what I planned would be a four hour romp turned into a 7 hour ordeal. We reached Gooch Shelter area and collapsed. Riley refused to eat and promptly fell asleep as I set up camp and got ready for dinner. The forecast was for below freezing temps and I know that Riley would not stay warm so I decided on the shelter sleep plan instead. Another hiker lost his pole so he carved a new one that included a pipe in the end that actually worked. Within minutes we named him “MacGruber”. Off to bed for another very cold night. Riley still shivered most of the night but better and off to sleep we went.Tuesday – April 5:Got up to another great sunrise with temps in the upper 20s. Got some hot coffee going and breakfast. Riley refused to eat his food so we packed and began today's hike. The goal was 16 miles to the top of Blood Mountain and into Neel's Gap. We left the trail to go into Suches Georgia to get burgers and beer but ended up with pizza, chicken wings and sodas. Riley after eating a bowl of his food jumped into a couch and fell asleep while we ate. We got a ride back to the trail from Suches towards Neel Gap. Got to Neel around 5pm and began to set up camp right away. There is a building older than the trail with bunk beds I was hoping to get one for the night to let Riley stay warm for once but they were full. We set up the hammock again then the goup of us built a campfire and chatted for hours. A hike we met a few miles back joined us named “Free” he was a pretty good guy around 60 but looked a real mountain man. He pack was small and light, nothing fancy and wore a block hat like fisherman wore. He told us this is his third time doing the trail. Looking at him, I sensed even at his age he could crush us all if he wanted. As we sat by the fire he pulled out a little pouch and wrapped himself a smoke that turned out to be of the Wacky Tobacky type. I was not surprised and laughed. Winds picked up and the sky was beginning to fill with clouds of an approaching storm. We went to bed and as I laid in the hammock I felt like I was on an amusement ride swinging back an forth. Again Riley could not get warm and was shaking constantly by now. By 5am he again figured how to wiggle out of his collar so I got up looking for him. I found him trying to bury himself in leaves so I brought him back and cuddled with him but no avail. By 6:30 am......next day....Wednesday – April 6:…... Riley could not stop shaking and got so violent that he could not stand up so I found some firewood and rebuilt the camp fire. Other hikers got up to help me with Riley and they had all fallen in love with him and wanted to help. One camper wrapped him in his down sleeping back while another got a down hoody over his head. We continued to hold up until around 9. Riley was still sleeping but shaking. Several of the hikers then left and we agreed to meet at the next shelter. Riley stopped drinking the night before and refused to eat. By 1pm it was apparent Riley was in trouble and by luck an hiker who was also a vet checked Riley out. He told me Riley was in going into shock from the constant shaking and needed to not hike and rest for at least 48 hours. I had to quickly come up with a plan B, not just for today but for how to keep Riley warm for the rest of the hike. Apparently I did a good job preparing for myself but completed underestimated what Riley needed. I already had reservations for Friday night at the Top of Georgia Hostel by Hiawassee 20 miles up the trail. I gave them a call, explaining the circumstances to see if I could come today and stay for three days. They were full but the woman who answered named “Buttercup” indicated they were full but she put me on hold so she could talk to hikers that already arrived and scheduled to stay that night. Great people immediately responded and so we looked for a ride direct to the hostel. As I waited for the ride I knew that I in a hammock, as comfortable as it was, would not work for both of us. The historic building had an outfitter in it and I explained the situation. They were great and $600 later I mailed home my hammock, picked up a great tent, high quality dog sleeping pad, sweater and a few other items. They also did a shake down of my gear and by the end my pack went from 37 to 28 pounds – and they took my old gear and mailed it home for me.....MARILEE be looking for a big box coming. By 3pm we had our ride and off to the hostel.We reached yet another spot on earth that was inspiring. The mountains of the Smokey's in the distance was stunning as the the hostel itself. Completely staffed by people who have completed the hike at least once and understood what we needed. Riley finally stopped shaking and ate three bowls of food and one bowl of water, then jumped on my bunk and fell asleep. You could tell he was happy. All other hikers kept checking on him and their concern and care made me feel so good. I was humbled. I was told that hiking this trail would change me and that change already started. This is a world filled with people I did not know existed anymore. Their kindness and care touched me and as I showered I cried. Good thing the water drowned out my sounds as most who know me, know I am too proud to cry. We including Riley joined the campfire that night until the rains began. I was glad of my decision to take a few days off rather than trying to hike to the next town for Riley. Off to bed. P.S. Riley is much better tonight and had slept most of the afternoon after eating three bowls of food.","Gooch Gap

Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526814,"Lets start with Riley is fully recovering, already mooching rubs and food from everyone. Getting here directly yesterday rather than an additional day of hiking was a smart decision as thunderstorms kicked in arond ten last night and I awoke to a brisk cold breeze....We went into town to restock, pick up my box from the post office and shove down a monster Hardee's bacon cheeseburger, fries and sweet ice tea. Now back at Top of Georgia and enjoying the day. Also more reflecting on the last few days. I remember that movie ""Into the Wild"" about Chris MacCandless who graduated college and promptly gave averything he owned away and began a hike around the country ending up in Alaska trying to figure out life. Sadly he dies of starvation due to a planning error but in the end he came to realize as demonsrated by a sign he carved in the bus he stayed in that ""Happiness is not real until it is shared"". That was a very profound statement I always believed and my last few days have strengthen my belief. With that I will rest today and tomorrow for Riley and that rain in the forecast for tomorrow wtih snow mixed in and temps in the 20s. Riley does not need that. By Saturday morning it should be clear and sunny but cold for one night then beginning to warm into the 40s for nihtime lows. Riley will start anew from here and cross into North Carolina. Love to all and best from Mr. Weather or Knots and Forecaster.","Top of Georgia Hiawassee Georgia

Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527875,"Friday April 8Last day at the Top of Georgia (TOG) Hostel and Georgia. Tomorrow morning will cross into North Carolina. Proprietor of TOG indicated that on a scale of 1 to 10, Georgia is a 4 but will increase to 6.5 as soon as we cross into North Carolina. On his scale a ten is both the Great Smokey Mountains and the White Mountains of New Hamshire. Two new hikers came in today that I connected with. Cherokee and Cool Hand. Both around 30 years of age and both carrying a Ukalalee. In the afternoon as we sat in the bunk house they began to start jamming together and were great. It turns out they just met on this hike and they seemed like they played together for years. Great blues, bluegrassand my favorite, early classic rock. We chatted while they played and Cool Hand indicated he never had a lesson in his life. He played drums early on with lessons but just had the knack to play guitars. I always envied those with that talent as I had piano lessons for years and never really got the hang of it and I hated lessons anyway. I had a blind teacher and I remember coming to her home and hiding the music she had in brail when I did not practice that week knowing the we would simply start a new song to learn. Of course after playing that trick a couple of times she caught on and would have my songs in her hand when I arrived. So much for being a smart ass! Cherokee got his name because he actually brought an axe along to cut wood, serve as a hammer etc. only to get rid of it the first chance he got because it was so heavy. I envied their free spirit and talent yet seemed grounded and knowing who they are. I reflected on my young adult life and realized that I was very immature and dedicated as they seemed. As evening aproached we all gathered around a campfire along with Dr Longstreet and Sassy who stayed with me at Neel Gap to Help Riley. Captain Rum joined the campfire along with several others. Rum connected with Cool Hand and Cherokee on the first day. He looked more like Captain Jack Sparrow with long dreadlocks, etc. Of course within minutes of the fire roaring, Cool Hand and Cherokee started jamming while everyone else pulled out their pouches and lit up on pot. Between everyone there they could have opened up a pot shop in Colorado. Even older adults 50 and over were carrying pot on the trip. By the time the evening was winding down I realized how I had missed connecting with and bonding with other males during my early years. I never knew my dad who abandoned us when I was less than a year old. I had four older sisters, so my life was built around women and women things like beauty pagents, piano concerts, dancing and the like. Nothing that a boy would like. I have bad memories of my mom but I do give her a lot of credit for trying her best to get me into cub and boy scouts which really got me interested in the outdoors. For all practial purposed my scout leaders where the only male role models in my life. We lived in the typical post WW2 housing boom type house with only one bathroom and three bedrooms. Money was always a concern as we lived on welfare. Mom cold not work with five kids and being single back then was not seen good within the community. We all took baths in the same water, and of course being the youngest I was the last so the water was cold and filled with soap scum. But that was life and Idid not mind.By the end of the evening I was so happy to experience bonding for the sole purpose of bonding with other guys for no other reason than that. There was no pretensious feelings or trying to outdo each other. We all simply sat around and yack about nothing important. This was my first transformation the Appalachian Trail would bring to me. I would go go to sleep both happy for the experience and sad this was not part of my early formative years.As i layed in the bed I reviewed the day seeing everyone on the trail was looking for something all for different reasons. Being a senior level consultant I came to realize these people haare getting some of the best life skills companies look for. There was no whining, other than the usual, instead focused on a mission, each mission different than the next with the hike being the tool to reach that mission. I have spent so much time with companies telling the world they build high performance teams, and spend millions on programs teaching their peopl with signs all around, etc. yet to no avail. They simply do not get what it means to be a high performance team. I had a west coast hospital client who wsa implementing an effort around patient care process that would cost them hundreds of millions of dollars. I was called in after three false starts to no avail and I only lasted 10 days. They called themselves high performance with all of the typical B.S. PC terms, signs, slogans, and pat on the backs to make themselves feel good but in the end they simply refused to realize they are a failure and senior leadership did not seem to be able to figure it out. Their most important value was ensurring everhyone felt good about themselves and no ones' feeling were hurt while the effort was failing. I heard about a year later they again are in trouble as thousands of patient medical records were hacked and made public yet to my understanding no one was held responsible and was simply explained as a situation beyond their control. For those companies I say if you really want people who are high performance, stand at the and of the trail and hire the people who have completed the trail. These people have dealt with adveristy beyond anything any education you and bring. They know that banding together was the first key. There was no rank, no escuses and most important they leave no one behind. They do not condemn anyone that is falling behind but rather protecting each other from each person's weakeness and instead focused on each other's strenghts. They all started with a plan only to realize that any plan no matter how well conceived would fail and were quickly able to adapt and overcome. This hike so far is the most demanding taks any one of us have taken on ensuring freezinf nights sleeping in 10 degrees, hiking with 40 pounds on their back up mountains, setting up tents in freezing rains and dealing with mice trying to get into your backpacks for food. Unlike the people of those reality TV shows who always have the ""sad"" story they use as a crutch and excuse to try and get pity to gain something they have not earned, these hikers have used their past adversities as the building blocks to stay focused on a mission and be a success. Many are in their twenties and I would have assumed they are like to TV fakes, yet almost all stated they hate those shows and do not watch. I for years have wondered about the future of this country as the young are getting dumbed down and have learned to expect everything and thing they are owed something. After only a week, I have met enough to start believing there is hope.Back to bed and Riley has jumped in the sack with me so I guess we will be snuggling for the night.","Top of Georgia Hiawasee Georgia

Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527890,"Saturday - April 9th
After a good night and a good night sleep off we go into North Carolina. The propriator of TOG was right. Off in the distance you could see the North Carolina mountains. What a view with expansive valleys and mountain lakes surrounded by mountain tops everywhere. As beautful as they were they were also daunting and scary. I knew that within a day I would have to climb those peaks and I questioned my strength to be successful. I was already sweating and exhaused only hours into the hike and knew that I had eight mroe miles until I would stop for the day. I some how got lucky and ran into the group I first connected with on day one including Commissioner, Stink Mouse, McGruber, etc. AS I druged along, I began to think about what I packed as the weight seemed like a ton on my back. I was carrying Riley's food and other items and fully loaded with food and water was coming in around 38 pounds. When I started thse seemed so easy and light yet now was beginning to feel unbearable and undoable. I questioned everything I packed and began a mental list of what wsa really needed to survive and succeed and what was simply convience or unnessary. The first item to go would be that 2 pound solar charger I was carrying. AS phone coverage was spotty at best and usually non exisitant, I figured I would recharge my phone on an off day and everyone would have to wait to hear from me until then. The list kept growing as I hike on in pain and suffering. I wold have paid dearly to come across a massage chair to ease they pain in my next ansd shoulders along with a good craft beer. If only dreamscame true.I caught up with a man named Joel in his mid 60s and realized he was struggling far more than me. Somehow I got strenght from his suffering and pretended this was just hike rather than an ordeal. We chatted for a few minutes about our plans for where to stop for the night and I then moved on.My mental spirit picked up after that meeting and I began more reflections on things like (1) Is there really a god (2) what is family (3) what is really important, and (4) what does it really mean to be a man, a good man and a good person. My brain began to focus that this hike would hopefully become my guide to grow up into manhood so I am now naming this hike the ""Trail to Manhood"". Hopefully I will get those answers in about 2184 miles minus the ones behind me.I reached the Plumorchard Shelter just short of the North Carolina boarder and decided it was already 3:30 and getting to the next one four miles down the trail would not get me there before 5 which wsa my daily target to ensure I could set up and eat before darkness set in. This was one of the best shelters I have seen so far and Georgia ensured we left their great state in style. A three level strucure built and delivered by U.S. Army Rangers who train in the area with carving showing it being dropped in by a Chinook helicopter. After serving with Army folks in my miltary career, I toasted them knowing they were just a good and professional I was was in the Air Force. Although I will never admit it to them and will always make fun when I can, I realized that regardless of the uniform, they are all professional and all great people. My hat off the U.S. Army Rangers.Lucky for me many of the group I connected with were already at the shelter and set up for the night. I was expecting both Dr. Longfellow and Sassy to come along as well. They were the two that stayed with me at Neels Gap to help our Riley, something that I will always be greatful for. They did not show up and I feared I would never see them again.On the other hand, a woman that was at the TOG Hostel arrived. I have reservations when I first met her and those reservations got stronger my the second as she opened her mouth. Regardless who said anything she alway had a ""better"" story or version and let everyone know it. According to her her children are all geniuses, had every ailment known to mankind and she cured everything, etc. It was non stop and insessant. She left for a few minutes and I turned to the group and asked them if they read the book or say the movie ""A Walk in the Woods"" by Bill Bryson. Without saying another workd everyone laughed know what I was referring to - that annoying girl he and Katz spent days trying to ditch. I wondered if this is now the same person jsut grown up and producing more annoying people. I am sure that Bill Bryson and Steven Katz would chuckle with that thougt.A night approached it seemed another cold night was in store. I could see wisk of what is called Mares Tails and a high thin layer of cirus clouds filling the sky. I decided to provide my own weather forecast that an approaching system was in our future within the next 24-28 hours. We went to sleep already shivering at temps began to plunge into the twenties before morning arrived.","North Carolina

Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527893,"Sunday April 10Woke up with Riley trying to crawl into the sleeping bag. I got up once in the middle of the night to pee and when I got back he already crawled into my bag. A ten minute wrestling contest ensuded where he simply would go limp and I would have to physically pick him up and move him all while trying to get back into the bag faster than he could. I finally won but pulled him close to keep him warm. The goal was Standing Indian Shelter but in the end that would not be. As we hike, the clouds from yesterday continued to build and by 3 in the afternoon, a few showers fell on us. I feared walking in a pouring rain and setting up a tent in the dark - a tent that I have yet to use or know how to set up. I stopped only six miles that day while others I was hiking with decided to continue to Standing Indian. We calculated that at best baased on our progress today that we would not get there until 6:30 and that exceeded my daily target. They left and I set up while others began to fill up the camping area. After a few brief showers, the sky cleared for the night so I decided to sleep in the shelter rather than set up the tent. This was a brutal day for me and I was exhausted and did not feel bad keeping up with the group.Joel that I met the other day also arrived as did an older couple about my age from Boston. As we sat by the fire he looked down to see what looked like a pot joint on the ground and yes it was. He gave it to Joel and Joel dissappeared somewhere for a few minutes. As people came in we got a different forcast from each not really knowing what was coming. North Carolina lived up to its reputation as increasingly more difficult climbs each day. Riley and I retired for the night at 7:30 to keep warm and get some sleep, something that was hit and miss each night with the cold temps. AS I laid there I thought about the trail naming ritual. This seemed much like what I experienced in the military. It was actually a badge of honor and respect to get a silly name as it indicated your peers respected and trusted you. Almost everyone that came without a name and got one would always resist and demand to no avail another name but as the days progressed you would hear stories about McGruber or Stink Mouse that they now accepted. For those of us that already had a trail name felt a little hollow but the group always accepted and usually nicknamed your trail name as part of that process. I became just ""Weather"" Riley's nickname of Forcaster never took as everyone simply loved Riley and his name was already spreading in both directions on the trail. I met a couple coming the opposite direction and they immediately said this must be Riley thay have heard about since yesterday. Apparently he now is the star performance and i am the opening act.Joel again arrived to this location and set up for the night in the shelter as did Wiki and the Boston couple. Off to sleep for yet another restless and cold night.","Plum Orchard

Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527896,"Monday April 11Up early and packing to get going. Goal today is actuall going past Standing Indian to the next shelter for a total of 12 miles. Again that would not be the case. Two big climbs and the increase in clouds suggested I stop at Standing Indian. First I knew that if I wanted to stay warmer I would have to figure out that new expensive tent I bought, and I turned my IPOD to radio mode and picked a local channel. Not sure from what town but the broadcaster stated that rain and thunderstorms had already begun in Hunstville Alabama and the forcast was up to one inch of rain in the mountains overnight. It was time to take out the tent and figure it out. Around 3pm Commissioner from the group I tagged along with came and talked. He decided to catch the rest of group and go on for another 6 or so miles. He was a good hike and strong kid so I had no doubt he would make it. The climb out of Standing Indian would be a brutal climb up about 1300 feet and require camping around 5600 rather than the 4300 were I was. Once he left I knew that everyone I tagged along with was now ahead of me but I would deal with that latter.By 4pm the sky was dark with clouds and a brutally cold wind started to set in. I along with other there simply decided to go to bed as the rain began and by 7pm it was pouring.I expected to see Joel come in but it never happended. At 3am I needed to pee and could not hold it anymore so I crawled out of the tent and peed into the rain. I knew there was a small tree about four feet from the door of the tent but the rain was so heavy and apparently we were now in the clouds that I could not find it for balance. Snow had mixed in with the rain and at that moment I knew getting a tent for Riley and I was the right decision. I was freezing in the rain yet had the best sleep to date falling to sleep at 7pm until now at 3am. As I crawled back into the tent, there was NO Riley ---- what !. I was frustrated with him and called out to heal but to no avail. I remember from that morning at the last location when I woke up that Riley was on the other side of me from where I put him. I then reach out and he was on my other side and I remember the woman from Boston told me that Riley in the middle of the night tried to crawl into her sleeping bag. My fear now was that he was wandering the camping area, lost in the heavy fog tryingto crawl into someone elses tent. I had no bearing other than how the tent waw laid out and I knew from the back that a bee line would lead me to the shelter. There were a few glowing embers left from the fire that helped me keep direction so I literally in bare feet crawling and feeling for trees and branched made my way to the shelter which literally was less than 30 feet from the tent. It took me five minutes to reach the shelter and did not see it until I was just a few feet away. I kept calling out for Riley and when I reached the shelter I felt something rub my leg. I reached down and it was himn, shaking, drenched like me trying to find his way back. I grabbed him by his collar and began the trek back to the tent quietly cursing him in my head for sneaking out. it took us three tries to find a tent only 30 feet away. The first time I sensed that I was no longer on flat ground but instead on a hill. I stopped, and decided to head back towards the shelter as that was a big structure and the best chance of getting lost on the mountain. The third time was a charm and into the tent we went. He was wet and shaking so I took my hooded sweatshir to cry him off and myself. I took of what was wet and simply crawled back into the sleeping bag, grabbed Riley and pulled him close to me , opening my sleeping bag and trying to cover him as well. Next thing I remember is it was now 7:30 am and the rain ceased. Fog was still heavy but visbility much better.","Standing Indian

Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527899,"Tuesday April 12We got up to everything sopping wet but that tent is now worth every penny of the $400 I paid for it. Other than the clothes we got wet from the ordeal that night, not a drop. My hats off to Big Agnes. It made no sense to try and dry everything out. I again listened to the radio and the forecast was for the rain to be gone by noon with sun and near 70 temps. I made breakfast that I did not eat so I closed the foil bag and decided that I would eat it later on so I put it into my backpack until then. I started out up the big hill and behind me wsa another camper from Standing Indian that caught up. We decided to hike together for the day. He was in his mid twenties and I could tell by his comments the night before that he was more likely to be homeless rather than a planned hiker. He made a few comments about his dad being and ex Marine, that they would at times have fights and that he wsa thrown out of the house. He was overall a good person yet hardended by what was a hard life. I had confidence he would somehow come through his past as he was dedicated and focused. We came across an actual Park Ranger which was odd considering we were not in a National Park but rather a National Forest. Apparently a rescue operation wsa in progress looking for an elderly single male who called his daughter somehow from the mountain to inform her that he had fallen and injured his leg on a ledge and could not get up. The Ranger stated the gap just ahead of us as the possible location and I immediately thought of Joel. There were too many coincidences to be anyone other than him. I asked the ranger if there was way to catch the group I was with stating they are mostly likely about an hald day ahead. He provided directions that would bypass a Ranger forest fire watch tower but would require us to hike 14 miles non-stop to reconnect with the trail farther down. It would not reduce miles but would eliminate the short but brutal climb to the top of the mountain where the tower stood. Off we went all the time thinking about this guy Joel that we now connected with over the last few days.By noon the skies began to clear as predicted and the temps climbed. We stopped to remove all but one layer as I was sweating like a pig in heat if there is such a thing. We somehow missed a turn and ending up actually in front of our target of Rock Gap Shelter and had to back track about a half mile. We reached the shelter around 4:30 and I for one wad dead tired and sore all over. I simply ws not even interested in making dinner and just sat there when like out of a movie this woman around 50 years old comes up the trail and ask us if we would like hre to cook us chicken. She by her dress was not a hiker and looked more like a mountain woman in a full length sun dress. We looked a little bewildered but said yes so hse said give her about an hour and then come down to the forest service road about a quarter mile way. It was now a perfect sunny day with warm winds so we hike down and there was a Winnebago type camper with mountain bikes strapped to the front, kyaks on the roof and grills cooking chicken tendered by the fifty something tall lean guy with a hat having miltary badges and pins on it. It turns out these are the so-called Trail Anges we have met so far and he was a retired Aramy Ranger instructor who now just travels up and down the trail from Georgia to Maine living life to the fullest and enjoying making hikers days with a hot meal. As we sat and ate chicken and fahitas we chatted with them. You could tell they loved their life and what they did and have been doing this for years. They apparently met three or so years earlier doing the entire hike and got together.As I sat and ate I came to the realization that these are the real people of the world that will be missed when they pass. Most likely no long newspaper obitualries or big funerals but the numbers that will remember them and miss them will be measured not in the hundreds or even thousands but litterally the tens of thousands. Talk about making a mark in life like that.After dinner Norm and I decided that we would get up early, skip breakfast and get to the Winding Stair intersection withthe local highway and get a ride into Franklin for a down day. We had 4 miles to make in two hours to catch a shuttle and knew that we had to hoof.After dinner and County EMS vehicle came up to us to get information on the lost hiker. All I could think of it was Joel and he spent the night in pouring and freezing rain lost on a mountain top. The EMP person stated that the guys wife called and that he had alzheimers. Based on the way Joel answered questions I was now convince it was one and the same so I asked if he was 67, from Georgia, wearing a red jacket and had long greying hair. He said yes and now my fear was confirmed as was the EMS staffof who they were looking for. We could hear helecopters circling the mountain tops. I knew that going to bed that night would be sad knowing someone that I met and talked to spent a terrible night in pouring rain injured and stuck somewhere on a mountain. Even worse was the fear that there was a real possibility he might not survive due to hypothermia. My thoughts went out for him and his family.Off to bed and a great night sleep as the temps stayed in the 40ies. As we laid in the shelter two other women were there too, both reading books. One had a red light on her head to read. Another hiker came by and commented on the right light glowing from the shelter and commented that it looked like a red light district. So another naming convention arose and everyone other than her of course voted to call her Shelter-Ho. She did not seem pleased as she was concerned her being in law enforcement would get ribbed from her peers if they figured out it was hers. I told her that it was going intom my journal with that name and she just smiled.... but who's law enforement will go with me to my grave.","Peak of Standing Indian

Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527900,"Wednesday April 13We woke up early as planned, skipped eating and off just after 7 am. We reached the trailhead at Winding Stairs Gap by 9:10 well before the shuttle would arrive. As we were hiking we stopped to take a picture next to a trail sign showing where we were and to aour pleasant surprise another Trail Angel appeared and offered us more food like beef jerkey and energy bars. Good thing we decided to stop for the picture otherwise we would have missed him. When we got to the parking lot yet another Trail angel was there. An older guy that appeared to be what you would expect of a mountain man of the Carolinas with the wool clothings and beard. In the back of his pick up truck wsa actual real and fresh orange juice, fresh bananas, strawberries, pinapples and home make cookies. So we both enjoyed another great meal and thanked him as the shuttle arrived and took us into Franklin N.C. for a well deserved down day. When we arrived we heard that Joel was found alive and airlifted out. To all those that rescue us lost souls I say THANKS !..... and best wished to Joel and family.In town I got a room and shared with Norm and Riley enjoying a hot shower, clean bed and warm room.Will update at then next down day location.","Franklin N.C

He is just entering the Great Smoky Mountains today 4/22 and Riley is off to doggie camp. It will take him about 8 or 9 days to get through and he is not expected to have any kind of cell service. He will probably take a couple of days off at the end and will catch up on the journal at that time. Thank you all who are following along with his journey.

Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530970,"It has been over two weeks since my last posting on April 14th from Franklin N.C. I am now in Hot Springs and completed the Great Smokey Mountains National Park. April 15 (Friday) – Winding Stairs to Wayah Gap Shelter – 11.0 milesBegan the hike out of Franklin headed to Wesser N.C. On the shuttle with Commissioner, Stink Mouse, McGruber and Sweet Feet. They told me that Percy left the trail today as his blister on his Achilles Heel was so bad that it was infecting his tendon. His father is a doctor and after a conversation he decided to go home back to Ohio for several weeks to let heal and hopeful restart his trip afterwards. Percy was a good and quiet individual and a good hiker. In his mid twenties and strong it was a reminder that injury can end any of our trips. A sunny day ahead and off we went. It turns out this portion of the trail is brutally hard with non stop ups and downs mostly over large bolder, tree roots, etc. It seemed I spent more time stepping up and down rather than hiking and mike knees and quads are screaming back at me. I felt like I did a million squats. Several parts were so steep and requiring a large step that I had to take my back pack off to keep balance and also hold Riley as he scrambled down rock faces.By evening all I could think of is doing nothing but sit. We connected with two other hikers, DQ and The Gringo Bandito. Both in their mid twenties, and brother sister, this is his graduation gift to her as she has always wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail. McGruber started a campfire. Ask Jeeves needed to get to Wesser to get money wired from his sister. I sense by his gear, etc he is not really a through hiker but homeless. He indicated he and his father got into a brawl and was thrown out of the house.As sunset approached you could feel the air chilling knowing we are in for another cold night. Riley and I crawled into the tent which did a great job of retaining heat. When I got up in the middle of the night to pee there was a marked difference between inside and outside the tent. Good Job Big Agnes.April 16 (Saturday) – Wahah Shelter to Wesser Bald – 10.6 milesToday started much like all other mornings. Riley and I were off around 8:30 for what the chart showed would be yet another brutal day of ups and downs. Around noon we crossed a USFS road and to our surprise there were the trail angles all set up. Canopy tents, campfire, chairs, etc. The team were members of the Burning Town Gap 1st Baptist Church. They had sausage gravy and biscuits, bacon, hamburgers, treats and more. They fed Riley and I all we wanted and refused to take a penny. I reflected on my growing up in a Catholic School and attending others throughout my life. At my school we never had a gym or organized sports. Finally the priest promised to build one and used that reason every Sunday to get more donations. After two years the so called gym was completed but when it opened, the back was butted up against the back of the alter area with a removable wall that allowed you to see directly into the church. Yes there was a gym floor with markings, etc but it was never used as such, instead church pews added to allow more people to attend church and of course get more donations. The pastor always had a brand new Cadillac every year but never a gym for the students. I remember when I got an F on my science project when I dissected a frog in support of Evolution. No surprise looking back but I remember coming to my class to ream my out in front of the class for such blasphemy. My sister wrote a nasty letter to the church – without signature of course – and at the next Sunday church read that letter in from of the entire congregation. He was livid that anyone should be so disrespectful and a sinner believing in evolution. That was the beginning of the end of my belief in organized religion as I had learned. Over the years I saw preachers with Rolex watches and fancy cars always asking for more money. I agreed to attend church with my ex-wife and simply saw the same. In this case the preacher has now sent around the collection baskets three times while he preached. He told us that a woman in her 70’s had fallen and broke her hip. Instead of suggesting anyone should help he asked the “Prayer Army” to say a prayer for her while again sending around the baskets for the fourth time. Everyone was happy to raise $100 bills high into the air so everyone could see what good Christians they were, yet when I stated loudly why is no one offering to help this woman I got a quick rebuke from my wife and the people around. I am sure they went home in their Mercedes for a Sunday family dinner knowing they had looked good for everyone. My loss in religion continued seeing such fraud and fake in people. They simply were not good people that hid behind religion.Yet here we were high in the North Carolina mountains. These were not just good people, they were sincere, friendly and for the first time in my life represented what I was taught in school. They even refused to take money from me to help offset what had to be a huge expense to help out all these hikes. I knew that they understood that most of the hikers were kids, many lost or no place to call home and these people bent over backwards to help those in need.For the first time I felt that religion is good, but only if built around people that are good. Fakes and Con Artist are everywhere and religion is a great hiding place for those. But not this day or this group. They represented everything I always believed was what made up good people. Honesty, honor, hardworking and self sufficient all while to help those that really needed help. Not one was wearing a fancy watch or clothes. Most in jeans and sun dressed with that weather worn look of a good life and a great smile somewhere covered by years of experience and aging.As we talked around the campfire. Sweetfeet stated that her hiking partner had abandoned her. They were both around 17…this was the same kid in Suches yelling at here because he refused to pay five dollars to a shuttle drive to take her to Neel Gap Outfitters to get new shoes. When we met her, her feet were covered in bandages and blisters. He stated that he would not give one penny to a panhandler for gas. Of course a huge yelling match arose outside the store that everyone could hear. In the end the shuttle driver felt so bad for her to took her for free. Now this idiot apparently not only left her by running ahead to get a few days away, but also took all of the food so she was grateful for the Trail Angels. They both live in the same own and she called her dad to tell the story. I can only assume that when that boy returns home, dad and him might be having a man to man conversations.We also met Special K. a fourteen year old girl who is attempting to be the youngest female to hike the entire trail alone. She was from Kearny Nebraska, very mature and dedicated. Her pack weighed more than mine and she was around 90 pounds. We all laughed when she told us that her school had worked out everything to she could do this trip other than her P.E. teacher that would not sign off requiring her to take that class again next year. REALLY – she is hiking 2184 miles with 40 pounds on her pack.Back to the trail and the non stop brutal ups and downs. I am beginning to really hate the N.C. mountains and Benton and MaKay who set the original trail. If there was any peak no matter how small we always had to top it. Our path was a zig zag back and forth simply to not forget any peak there was. WE climbed to around 5500 feet at Rocky Bald where a old stone fire tower stood overlooking the valley below. To my surprise there was still Franklin N.C. about five miles away – what….two days hiking and still just miles from where we took a down day.April 17 (Sunday) – Wesser Bald to the town of Wesser and the Nantahala Outdoor Center – 5.7 milesWoke up to another cold night with Riley snuggling his nose into my sleeping bag for warmth. A brutal 2500 descent into Wesser. We all gathered at the little grocery store for food and water. A man riding his motorcycle stopped and talked to us. This area was beautiful with a river in from that was set up for the previous world championship competition kayak course and the NOC had multiple buildings housing outdoor classes, hostel beds for hikers and a full blown outdoor fitter to resupply. He bought us all cold beers to celebrate our trip so far. All of a sudden a woman who resembled Special K along with two girls crosses the bridge walking towards us. We knew instantly this was Special K’s mom and sister who drove from Nebraska to see her. You could tell this was one happy reunion.Commissioner and I decided to get a hostel room that had two beds while the rest decided on the campground. As evening approached we sat by the river and admiring the views. My nightfall, the others built a huge campfire and Cool Hand and Cherokee arrived in time to begin playing on their ukes. The group broke out into singing to include both the National Anthem and God Bless America. When the fire died so did everyone and we retired for the night. When Commissioner came back to the bunk house I had already crawled into my bag on the bunk. He turned on the light and without saying anything handed me a beer, sat down on my bed and put one of his IPOD earplugs into my ear while the other in his and began to play music. I sensed Commission may have had one or two more beers than he intended. He began to pretend he was playing the drums while we listened. Then he put the music on speaker to a mountain country style song with a female singer that sang a soft and beautiful song about taking her children down to the creek to wash them up before bedtime. We both were long asleep before the song ever finished but a prefect way to end a day in mountains.April 18 (Monday) – NOC to Sassafrass Gap – 6.9 milesUp early to a sunny day. Stopped at the restaurant for breakfast and had them also cook up a three egg and cheese omelet for Riley. When I told them who it is for, I think they decided three eggs were not enough as it looked more like a ten egg omelet which Riley loved.Today would be nearly 5000 feet of climbing and hot. I decided that I am going to petition the governor of North Carolina to change the phrase on their licsense plate from “First in Flight” to “Home of the hikers’ big can of Whoop Ass”. This is getting old and exhausting.As I left NOC I reflected how the Appalachian Trail really follows the entire history of the United States from the north where American begin and the revolutionary war to the deep south with its history of plantations, slavery and southern hospitality. All between were locations like Blood Mountain serving as a reminder of the Civil War. As I continued to hike the dogwoods were blossoming everywhere and spring was in early bloom. When I connected with Commissioner again I asked where the others were. He indicated they decided they did not want to hike the Great Smokey Mountains National Park and were hitch hiking to Hot Springs. What started off as eight of us on the first night meeting were now down to just Commissioner and I. We had reached the statistical number of hikers that begin that actually finished. Another brutal day ended with Riley and I crashing in the tent. He fell asleep the second we stopped and I removed his harness. I realized that he was not getting enough food and could see more of his ribs now. I was feeding him twice what I gave at home but he always wanted more so I gave it to him. Now I realized that I did not have enough food for him to get to Fontana. When I crawled into the tent he rolled over and simply licked me then fell back to sleep. After all I had put him through he still loved me with that big wet and nasty kiss but I did not care… I simply pulled him next to me and rubbed his head until I fell asleep too.April 19 (Tuesday) – Sassafrass Gap to Browns Fork – 9.7 milesSlept well and awoke to Riley hungry. I decided to give him all of the rest of his food knowing he would be out and decided I would figure that out later. He wolfed down everything and still kept looking at me for more. Today was forecast to rain with yet another monster climb to Cheoh Bald. As we hiked I realize Riley was again losing his zest. Instead of running ahead of me, he just stayed behind at a slow pace. I several times over the last two days came across a hiker named Socks and her father who joined her at the NOC with the intent to stay with her through the Smokey Mountains. I could tell he was struggling with the harsh climbs as bad as I was and the day was also very hot. We chatted while we cursed the climbs. I was out of water an Sock indicated there was a stream about half mile ahead so I left them to get water. Riley by now is now hot, thirsty and hungry. We got to the water spot which was next to a road. A Trail Angel left fruit. I had to make a decision right there. Either got 4 more miles and camp out or hike into Fontana today and get food for Riley. Rood was the choice so I began down the road towards Fontana. I came to a cross road where I turned left with eight miles to go when a local stopped and offered me a ride into the resort. I accepted and we were both happy….but now I was about five miles short of hiking the trail.We approached the Fontana Hilton Shelter – so named because is had hot showers, toilets and running water along the banks of Lake Fontana and a stunning view of the mountains. Again there were the Trail Angels. This time they were parents from Birmingham Alabama of another hiker and set up with hamburgers, hotdogs and home made chili. Riley ate four hot dogs while I scarfed down two huge plates of that chili along with three cans of orange soda. We then st up our tent along the shelter and met Rock Hobbit and Yonder, two 2015 hikers that were a wealth of great information. We talked about Trail Days in Damascus in mid May and convinced me that I must attend as it was part of the history and fun of the hike. It turns out this is the world’s largest gathering of hikers and all of the vendors set up shop to include fixing and gear and helping hikers out. As we sat and talked a North Carolina air National Guard C-130 swooped down over the dam and the lake only about 200 feet off the water and disappeared around the mountain bends. It was a great sight to see.I headed for a hot shower, a real toilet with real toilet paper and hooked my phone into the solar charge set up at the shelter. Now this was living compared to the last two weeks as far as shelters were concerned. A huge area was set up for campfires so Riley and I joined in. There was about 40 hikers there that night, the most I have seen before. Everyone was preparing to enter the National Park that started just on the other side of the dam.April 20 (Wednesday) Fontana HiltonI awoke early and Riley and I headed for the Resort. There really is not a town there, just the resort much like the YMCA of the Rockies nestled into the Carolina mountains. I stopped at the little store and got Riley food. We headed over to the main building were the restaurant was. I leased Riley to the fence on a deck overlooking the resort while I went and got a breakfast called the Hillbilly Breakfast. Only nine bucks included two huge homemade biscuits covered in sausage gravy, three eggs on top and more sausage gravy – WOW !!! We went back to the general store to resupply and to my surprise there ws Stink Mouse, MacGruber and Sweet Feet. We chatted and they told me that they first hitched into Asheville then to here and would be hitching on to Hot Springs.When we returned to the Fontana Hilton there again was more Trail Angels. This time it was huge. They had multiple shade tents set up, dozens of chairs for everyone to sit on and food, food, and food. Ice Cream, hamburgers, bacon (Which Riley gladly accepted from everyone) and so much more. Again another Baptist Church and yet again a refusal to take even one penny from me. Yes this are good people. Many of us simply sat all afternoon with them chatting, singing and of course eating. The got school children to build a little packages that had bandages, candy, hand wipes, etc in them and a note wishing us the best. I am sorry that I did not keep my note as now I wish I could have written them back for their care.As the afternoon was ending, Socks came in indicating her father was struggling and she had to leave him behind and was worried about him. I connected with him and understood what he was going through. So I and another hiker named Big Bird because she was very tall and wore a yellow rain suit when it rained decided to go back and find him and bring him food and water. Hey at least I felt like this would make up for that five miles I cheated on the day before. We hike for just over an hour when I found him. Other than tired, exhausted and thirsty he was still doing fine and was grateful for coming out for him. So instead of a rescue this turned into a morale builder with the three of us hiking back to the shelter area. Later that evening they approached me with dad holding a cold can of beer to thank me. He decided he had enough and his wife was driving out from Raleigh to pick him up. After he left, Socks indicated that dad insisted on joining her not knowing how difficult it was. I reminded her that dad’s will always want to be their daughter’s hero and will never admit they are weak. She laughed.Again another C-130 flew overhead but this time slower and higher in the twilight sky. Tonight was the full moon and also a holiday according to most hikers called Four Twenty Day in celebration of POT – yes that plant most of us adults call marijuana. As the campfire started up you could smell the burning plant everywhere. Around the campfire we met a couple from Finland also hiking the trail. Many of us then walked to the dam to see the full moon shine down the entire length of the lake. What a view. Others scrambled down to the lake shore and went swimming.I tried to see if a text would go through to Marilee to tell her I missed her and loved her. To my pleasant surprise I got a reply with emoji smiles and kisses. As the night settled I heard for the first time in years a loon on the lake. It reminded me of growing up in Minnesota an going to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area and Voyageurs National Park on the Canadian border. I remembered Marilee and I took Rachel and Gabe there years ago to Veterans Lake where the loons were plentiful.April 21 (Thursday) – Fontana Hilton to Great Smokey Mountains National Park – 6.6 milesAwoke very early around 5 am. Still dark out but could see fireflies everywhere in the trees. It reminded me of growing up in Minnesota where in the summer you would catch them and put many into a jar to watch them all night. I was reminded to ensure I made air holes on top and to release them by morning.This was going to be my last day with Riley as he was to be picked up at ten and taking to the Standing Bear Hostel and Dog Kennel on the north side of the National Park. I sat on a bend overlooking the lake against the night sky with all of the stars shining. While holding Riley many reflections began to dance through my head……. ON TO PART TWO!!!","Winding Stairs Gap Trailhead

Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531023,"April 21 (Thursday) – Fontana Hilton to Great Smokey Mountains National Park – 6.6 milesPART TWO!!!The dam was completed in 1944 and is absolutely astonishing. On one side the water is about 50 feet from the road on top while on the other side it appears the dam drops about 400 feet to the river below giving you the real impression just how deep this lake is. There are enormous water pipes made out of concrete about 100 feet in diameter to direct the water through the generators and into the river below. They simply drop nearly straight down into darkness. Cool Hand and I the night before climbed onto the dam visitor center roof where there was a lookout and could see the generator building below with lights on and cars that looked like spots.I patched up some hot spots on my feet before they turn to blisters and by now twilight was in the eastern sky. Several hikers were up and all were saying goodbye to Riley. I sat quietly thinking about my military career after seeing the Air Force C-130 flyby the night before.I believe my career was instrumental in defining who I was and gave me opportunities I could not ever dreamed about….but was I a good person? I always believed our role was to protect those unable to protect themselves from very bad people …. Those that did not believe in freedom or live, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and wanted to dominate and control the world at any cost. How could parents strap bombs to their children to kill us? I saw them simply as cowards and thugs that only cared about themselves. I wondered if this millennium generation really understood what is going on in the world or have they really understood history. Until this trail I believed most of the new generation was too self absorbed in their 15 minutes of fame all while their future is in real jeopardy. The elitist mindset that once controlled all of Europe was again taking over America who wanted to own and control everything just like royalty did until the 19th century where the common person did not own land, had no real rights and was subject to the elite few that dominated the world…..other than the United States. Freedom and rights were and still a threat to those that believe they alone shall control everyone else and this generation did not realize the speeding train on the tracks heading for them. Yet on this trail I did start to see a glimmer that there is still hope. I would never have imagined a group of 20 somethings’ sitting around a campfire and break out in the national anthem or god bless America like they did back in Wesser. Somehow this misfits or rag tag backpacking, pot smoking troubled youths were far above their peers who spent their free minutes gossiping on Facebook or watching every reality show. Many on the trail indicated they stopped watching television years ago.At the campfire I gave them a history of our forefathers and why they created the constitution. Most were far more educated and knowledgeable let alone agreeing in the constitution.We talked about being in the military and I was asked why many military people did not want to talk about their job just like everyone else does. It was hard to tell them that we were sending in kids their age to accomplish the most terrible of acts in the name of freedom and how does someone tell you of their experience . How do you tell someone that you are a good person and an honorable person yet you participated in the death of many including women and children. Other military members on the trail rarely talked about it other than to other military people.I decided that I was a good person. Or at least when I finally stopped acting like an immature kid around age 30. I started to think about all of my accomplishments and achievements but in the end there were only two that stood out for me. I am hoping those two really defined me. The military was an exciting life full of new adventures and opportunities to experience the world. I deployed to 22 countries after 9/11 including some of the most dangerous places on earth like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and others. I participated in missions to capture the number two war criminal in Serbia and interdict contraband being smuggled into Kosovo. I deployed to Washington D.C. to be part of the Crisis Action Team in deploying assets to the combat zones and served on the senior staff for all of the Middle East Area of Operation yet all of that did not rise to the top of my list. Instead…My proudest moment was actually deploying to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. I got the call around 7 in the morning after the collapse of the dikes. The caller was the Chief of Staff to the General in charge of all of Air Combat Command. He needed a team to deploy immediately to the area where no services were available for rescue operations to come to Bell Chase Naval Air Station. I was told thousands of people were stranded on their roofs, many who already died from exposure or drowned in oil contaminated water. Others were stranded at the Superdome. My unit responded with more volunteers than I could use. We were packed and ready for take off my early afternoon waiting for the C-130 to come for us. As I was riding in the plane I emotionally was detached from their peril wondering why were they so stubborn not to leave before the hurricane came. That all changed the moment I landed. You could smell death in the air even before the airplane landed. The temps were in the 90s with stifling humidity. We landed in a place like no other I have experienced. There simply was no water, food, power, government, services or anything else. Dead animals littered the base that perished in the flood waters. Water was contaminated and the entire area was as austere as you could envision. Not even police were seen. We took off in Army helecopters for the Super Dome to find survivors. When we arrived, my disdain for their stupidity vanished in a heartbeat. The Superdome wsa completely surrounded by oily water. Buildings and houses in the area on fire. AS the choppers landed you could see feces on the tarmac around the Super Dome. As we opened the doors the combination of super heated air and death rushed out. These people have been living in hell for two days without anything. Dead bodies piled in the upper rows of the stadium. Complete darkness inside. These people lived through hell and it was the job I signed up for…. Help those that cannot help themselves…. I walked away from that tour knowing I was part of something good rather than destructive rescuing over 9000 people from certain death.My other moment was at the retirement ceremony of the Base Commander, General Terry Tripp. When I took over my unit in 20000 it was on the verge of collapse due to a multitude of personnel problems. I had no background in their mission or education in their technology – combat weather. What the heck was that. I had no choice but to find the best people and trust in them. My trust was well spent as within two years the unit turned around, obtained the unthinkable perfect score in an Operational Readiness Inspection and became the unit of choice by name for deployments. After 9/11 I received the call that up to nine members of my unit would be deployed and join the Army’s elite 82 Airborne on the initial assault into Baghdad. Two members that stood out were now Seargents’ Magee and Brodin who two years earlier came right out of high school. At first I laughed with my Senior NCO how young and immature they were yet two years later they were what was to become one for the history books in the fastest, farthest, largest movement of military forces upon an enemy ever. When they all came home, I saw how professional and mature they had become. I received a call a couple of months later asking if both Brodin and Magee were available……available for what……Back to the base commander retirement….his proudest moment was standing behind those two as they met and exchanges coins with the president of the United States. Those guys I trusted in created one of the best units in the entire Air Force inventory, receiving multiple national recognitions. That day I was not their commander but their “dad” proud of their people who proved they can live up to any challenge.Commissioner and I went to breakfast at the resort for the same hillbilly breakfast then turned Riley over to the Kennel place. I would not see him for a week. After Riley departed, Commissioner and I began the trip into the national park. A steep 3000 climb over six miles lead us to a campground with rain fast approaching. We set up, ate dinner and settled in. By 8:30 I was bored and the rain had not started so I got out of the tent. Commissioner asked if I was bored to which I said yes so we got up and walked around finding other hikers that had a campfire. We joined them but as the fire died down commissioner asked me if I brought a flashlight…..no I did not. We both turned around to see nothing but black, not even trees could be seen. No sooner after looking around did the rain start and did it start….pouring within seconds. One of the hikers used his headlamp but by the time we reached our tents 50 yards away we were already completely soaked. To make matters worse I did not close my rain fly door and the top of my sleeping bag was soaked. Somehow I did get a good nights sleep.April 22 (Friday) – GMSNP Campground to Russel Field – 8.1 milesIt was an all day pouring. The trail was so worn that sections were a foot or more lower than the surrounding ground turning the trail into rushing river. My boots were filled with water and the only solution was to keep hiking to the next stop. Most of the mountain was covered in dense fog. We reached the shelter around 5pm and the rain cleared a little. The ridge runner controlling the shelter was named Carl, a 72 year old man who has been doing this for 13 years. He completed the Appalachian Trail in 1999 and took this job after. Around the shelter were these small plants about 8 inches high with a single center stem and eight leaves in p perfect circle making the plant look like one of those tropical beach umbrellas. I did not know what they were other than cool. Rain returned so other than drying off there was nothing to do but go to sleep. It rained on and off all night but the rain drowned out the snoring of the hikers.April 23 (Saturday) Russel Field to Silers Bald 14.6 milesBy morning the rain stopped. I could tell for the first time I was getting better at hiking and the backpack was not feeling so heavy. Off hiking for a long day as we planned to go into town if we could make NewFound Gap in two days. This was going to be my longest day yet. In the morning the group decided to modify my name from Mr Weather or Knots to Weather or Knot. They thought too formal and too long and shortly it was just “Weather”. So from now on I would be the hiker known s Weather Or Knot.I came across workers fixing the trail from the enormous rainfall. The hard work they had in front of them. When I reached Silers’ Bald. Commissioner was already there and had already organized a slow clap for me as I came in. that was a first for me in my life and felt pretty good. He even had the park ranger be part of the greeting and clapping.The park ranger set up tent next to me so we started to chat. Eathan, his first name was a mid twentied rugged good looking guy much like Jeremiah Johnson, the mountain man. A Naval Academy graduate he was also a nationals champion rower and was training for the 2020 Olympics. He used this job to hike 20 miles a day in the park from shelter to shelter to stay fit. Pretty impressive guy and very grounded. I asked him if he was packing and he showed me is Sig Saur. I asked him if he slept with it and he just smiled and patted his hip.Commission already worked the plan for tomorrow to get up at 3am to climb Clingmans Dome, get to New Found Gap, hitch a ride into Gatlingburg to see the Stanley Cup games which started at noon. I of course told him not a chance and would catch up to him later as I would sleep in until 6 or so.","Fontana Hilton

Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531983,"April 24 - Sunday - Silers Bald to New Found Gap into Gatlingburg 11.0 milesWell Commissioner and the ohers did get up at tree like they said and off to Clingmans Dome. I staying in the tent until 7:00 as the outside of the tent was covered in frost. By 8 Riley and I were packed and headed to Clingmans Dome at 6,643 feet. Trail started as all others but as I climbed the forest changed over to to a dense thick coverage to include pines and moss xpvering everthing. the smell was a sweet pine smell. I connected with another hiker and he gave me a background on why the peaks and valleys were called Blds and Gaps. Prior to the National Park taking over the land, the hills were populated with famers who had their cows roam the tops eating away the coveraged and the trees logged for timber hence called Balds. The name like Daniel Bld was the name of the owner for that mountain top.I came across three women easily in their 70s hiking the otherway and we chatted. They are locals who come every weekend and hike together. For their age they were in great shape and even had trail names like Graham Cracker, etc. Made Clingmans Dome around noon and what a view it was. The storms had passed and the sky cleared as I climbed the final steps to the top. Several of us laughed as there was aprking lot close by for park vistors and we could hear them complaining how hard it was to climb the quarter mile trail to the top.I left to get to New Found Gap to hitch a ride into town. The indiviual who I met earlier was there and he was a local so he took myself, Cherokee, Cool and and Sherpa into town. Cherokee and I set off directly for Five Guys where we both got the biggest burgers with large fries and large drinks. I swallowed down three full glasses of the sweet tea while just standing there while they prepared my burger.... which I ordered with additional cheese and additional bacon. Caught up with Commissioner and the rest just relaxing for the day. Gatlingburg was really more of a tourist site than a town with no less than 16 shops offering old time photos alone. The main street was more like a midway at state fairs than a main street. Everything was expensive. It cost me 20 dollars to get two new batteries for my Streripen water filter. WOW what a shock.April 25 - Monday - Back to New Found Gap to Tri Corners Gap 15.1 milesThis is where I take a break to tell you a story. As I packed the night before I realized I somehow left my small bag at Silers Bald with about $500 worth of electronics including my IPOD. As the bag and IPOD had my information I was confident someone would call me. I headed to the local outfitters around 8 to get a ride back up to New Found. A trail angel van came by and picked me up first so I jumped on board. Three other hikers that I never saw before were already on board. To make a long story short, they were talking about the bag and the items between themselves so I questioned them. they told a detailed story about another hiker that I knew that infuriated me. Sadly the story was a complete lie as I would find out four days later and I was conned by con men who most likely took my stuff and made the story up when they saw me get on the bus. As the days passed with no phone call I felt sure this hiker had my stuff as others told me he had my IPOD. I left him harsh words in the shelter logs only later to relalize not only was he not guilty but he was actually trying to catch me to return my Ipod. when we finally met at Standing Bear I knew by his face that not only was he not guilty but that I falsey accused a very good and honorable person of being a thief. Without a doubt that was my lowest point emotionally of the trip. I accussed hm of not doing the right thing, and not beng a good man but in the end it was I that was wrong and that day a 22 year old honorable person proved he was the better man. I can only hope that someday I and regain his trust and respect.When I arrived at New Found gap, again the trail angles were on site with more free food so of courseI ate as much as possible then headed out for another long day of hiking. A nice cool sunny day helped. As I hiked i remembers my mother's birthday was just a few days ago so I mentally wished her a Happy Birthday. I mentally told her that I still could not forgive her some some of the things in life like the fact that she knew that I had both a brother and sister. Apparently she and my brother's mom kept in touch right from the beginning after I was born and she kept that secret to her grave. My brother even had a copy of my mother's divorce decree so he knew that I existed but never knew where we lived. We all meat for the first time just a few years ago and although it is great the knowledge that I could have had a great relationship with another brother is something that I will never understand on why parents intentionally huirt their children to get back at a spouse that died decades later. I never know my father as he skipped out and never heard from again before I was one years old.Right after I wished her a happy birthday, several birds in the tree above me started to sing so I can only hope that was a way of her telling me sorryAlso the smell in the air was awesome much like fall leaves but with a slightly sweet and spicy aroma. I took the time to keep breathing in as I hiked and enjoyed the sunshine. By five I arrived at the shelter and already a big camfire was going. It was a great end to a great day.April 26 - Tuesday - Tri Corners to Davenport Gap and the end of Great Smokey Mountains National Park 14.8 milesToday was going to be my last day hiking without Riley. A wakeup and short 4 mile hike the next day and we would be reunited. Every night this week was warm and I was literally sweating in my sleeping bag and hadto sleep on top. I could feel the sweat dripping and my skin sticking to the bag nylon. For once I believed spring has sprung in the South , a belief that would be short lived.April 27 - Wednesday - Davenport to Standing Bear Farm Hostel and Kennel 4.0 milesGot up to another great day without eating so I could get to Riley. As I approached the farm I looked up the road and there was Riley standing in the road and came running towards me when he saw me. We wrestled and I hugged him. As I walked in, several of the campers were sitting around a fire pit and when they saw me they said that Riley was laying with them and suddenly jumped up and ran towards the road - he must have smelled me. I got a bed in the hostel with space next to me for Riely to sleep. That night ther were about 40 hikers there and we all relaxed around a campfire and played Texas Hold em at a picnic table. I think the biggest winner and loser totalled about a dollar - no high stakes here. Antes were a nickle.April 29 - 30 and May 1st. Hostel to Hot Springs 31 milesThe first day I hiked to Max Patch, a large area tha wsa bald due to grazing with a great view. I set up my tent next to three others. Around 7pm a vehcile pulled up along a USFS road and three women in their 70s got out and walked over. The tents were theirs and we chatted. One of the women had a vest with all kinds of hikin patches and told me that until last year she held the record for the oldest woman to complete the Appalachian trail at age 72 three years prior. Pretty impressive and encouraging to see that you can get old and not let you slow down. The temp dropped so by 8 I was alreading in the tent with Riley for the night. The next morning I continued to Deer Park. Notices were already up thatHot Springs had forest fires and that the Appalachian Trail was closed north of Hot Springs. The fire spread to 5000 acres and to top it off Hot Springs was holding its annual Bluegrass festival. Word spread that the town was overloaded with not even spaces for hiker tent. By miod afternoon the skies turned dark and severe storms were building so I stopped short of the town three miles at a shelter hoping to stay dry and not hike into town in bad weather. It was a good choice as the rains began by five and it rained all night. The next morning the rain stopped and I hoofed it into town and got a hotel. Commission was already in town so we agreed to share the room. The town was still in chaos with visitors leaving from the fesival and USFS Hotshots and Smoke Jumpers a,ll camping in town fighting the fire. For the first time I could see the hills behind the town all completely charred. The fire got within hundreds of feet of homes on the mountain side but saved by the fire fighters. Like all other towns, our first stop was a real meal hot and served. Monster storms erupted late afternoon with rain porung from the skies, lighting and thunder everywhere and cold winds rushing down the mountain sides. DQ and Bandito sent me a text message to come and visit as she baked a cake. DQ, a mid 20s female was hiking the trail with her brother Bandito. She is graduating from college in two weeks and they decided to get a suite at the Hot Springs Resort as they wul be getting off the trail next week so she could attend the graduation. Her brother asked her what she wanted as a gist and this trip was her gift from him. Youd could tell the close bond and support these two have for each other over the weeks and I had come to admire them both.May 3 through 8 - Tuesday to Sunday. Hot Springs to Erwin 67 milesI and commissioner had a plan to hike this in five days but weather shot those plans down. I only had enough dog for to get me to Erwin on the fifth day.Out of Hot Spring the trail was reopended. As I hike through the burned forest the first thing I noticed was the complete silence. No leaves to russle in the wind, no animals not even insects. The smell of the fire was a light sickening sweet smokey odor most likey better after the severe storms yesterday night. As I crossed a bridge from town onto the trail the river was flowing heavy from all of the rain but now it was nearly black with ash from the fires. Along the rtail you could see where the hot shots had created control burns to contain the actual bigger fire. As I came close to the edge of the control burned area I could for the first time hear birds chirping in the trees left unburned. Rain began once again as I hikednowe remember my comment about hot nights. Well while in Hot Springs, Marilee sent me a package with replacement dog food for four days. Because it wsa so warm the lat ten days I decided to send home that 18 degree sleeping bag along with other winter gear I had. I reconnected with Commissionre at Allens Gap and a small store. We came across three local men who also were part of the local hiking group. They told us the forecast was for heavy rain that night with temps well below freezing and snow in the mountains. By now it was late afternoon so Commissioner and I decided not to continue to the planned stop but instead detour to a hostel about five miles up for the night. There we met Dr Mom and Dude along with several others all hearing the same forecast. We started a campfire but by 5pm the rains moved in and it poured all night. So we were already a half day behind shedule.We hostelled with Vagabundo, a Virgina State Police Investigator that told us of some of the most bizarre murder cases he investigated. It rained all night but ceased at morning. The temperature was 36 degrees and we were only at 300 feet knowing that day we would again climb to over 5000 feet.That hike was without the worst ever so far. The rain restarted around 10 am and as I climbed I could see the beginnings of snow accumilation on the ground. By noon I was hiking not in rain but in snow pellets that continued for hours. I caught Commissioner at a point where the trail required you to literally climb up and down huge two story bolders that were now wet slippery and dangerous. We talked about our plan to jhie 15 miles but as the day continued were were soaked, freezing, covered in mud where the tail turned into rivers of mud from what now wsa pouring rain and fog so we reached a shelter after only 8 miles and 7 hours of hiking. Others were there as well and we all attempted to sleep in the shelter. Those in tents were also trying to get into the shelter as the rain was now a blowing mist and even in the tents everything was soaking wet. We shared blankets and did evryting we could to try and stay warm and dry - both to no avail and by morning we and everyhing we had was sopping wet even those items under the cover of the shelter. Commissioner and I decided to forgo breakfast and make it to another hostel about 11 miles away. Now we are a day and half behind schedule and I knew that even feeding Riley much of my food we were out of dog food in just one more day. Commissioner decided to keep going as he had enough food and we agreed to meet in Erwin while I went to the hostel.I met both Pinky and Brains there who just returned from a slackpack hike. This is where a hostel will take you to a location on the trail and you hike backwards to the hostel for that night. I decided the only solution for dog food was to plan to slackpack the next day 22 miles with a small backpack the hsotel lets you use knowing that I could make up a lot of time. The hike was both brutal and beautiful as I crossed Big Bald, a huge old farm of hundreds of acres of grazing land aat 5600 feet. Riley completed 22 miles in eleven hours but more importanly we regained a full day. Now Sunday the eighth I have only miles to get to Erwin and the hostel owner driver took me back to yesterdays slackpack starting point at Spivey Gap. I had to feed Riley the rest of my SPAM along with dog food the hostel owner provided by we arrived happy and sound. I am off now to the local Wallmart ot get Riley more food.","Hot Springs

Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532849,"Monday – May 9 – Uncle Johnny’s through Thursday May 12 Damascus For Trail Days – 84 milesIn order to make trail days I needed to both make a couple of big days and also plan to hitch for part of the distance of 113 miles in four days. The plan was to hike to Lake Watauga Shook Picnic Area then hitch the last 40 miles into Damascus on Thursday. After Trail Days I intent to hitch back to the lake to complete the miles and get back into Damascus the following Tuesday.While at Uncle Johnny’s several interesting developments occurred.Several of us met in Erwin for dinner Saturday night at a local Mexican place that had great food. I saw Ghostrider that I have not seen since Standing Bear. Ghost rider is a former Marine Officer and commander. He is well built in his thirties with a great level of humility and common sense. He told me that during the horrible weather the week prior that he took a fall and face plant into the ground. He got a bruise on his hand and head from the fall. After he got down a woman stopped to help him and he must have fallen in love as that is all he talked about. Apparently she is a nurse in Asheville and gave him her name but he was too shy to tell her that he had a hearing loss and did not ask her to repeat it. Now three days later he is desperate to find her. Finally socks came to the rescue as she lives close by and found who she was. I have not seen Ghost Rider since but being a tough minded marine I have no doubt he will find her. I joked that I expected an invitation.Vagabundo, the Virginia retired State Trooper arrived at Johnny’s with bad news that an MRI revealed he has been hiking since Blood Mountain with two fractures in his leg and his trip is over. DQ arrived visibly shaken telling us a story that a man pretending to be a trail angel approached her as she climbed to Big Bald. She refused to state his exact words as she indicated they were too vulgar for her to repeat but that he chased her with the intent of sexually assulting her. DQ had pulled out her weapon, a 9 mm gun during this and ran down the trail to the hostel. About an hour bandito came in and wanted to after him but we talked him out of that.Not far behind comes in Heavy D, with a rattle snake he just caught and killed just short of the hostel. Several of the younger hikers including Brains, Pinky and Socks volunteered to work for a room and did a great job so the local maintenance man decided to cook them a fantastic dinner including cooking the snake. Bandito kept the skin to cover the hiking pole he was making.For dinner on Sunday we all decided to join DQ, Bandito and their mother that drove in to pick them up so DQ could go to her college graduation ceremony. After we ate we all wished them well hoping to see them both on the trail in a couple of weeks.I decided to collect firewood so we could have a campfire. The evening was perfect with clear skies and warm temps. About 30 people gathered around for the evening. After a while I began talking with Daniel, the individual who seems to love Riley and I know Riley loves him. Every time they see each other they wrestle for about twenty minutes and Riley has learned to be gentle especially when clamping down on Daniel’s arms and hands. After a while Riley would be exhausted and literally fall asleep next to Daniel rather than coming back to me. Daniel would then just sit there and rub Riley.I met Daniel for the first time several weeks back around Max Patch. Daniel is a Native American who just turned 25 the week prior. A strong hiker and strong person, he well built and looks more like a linebacker. One of his favorite things is to sleep cowboy style at night so he can see the stars. As I talked with him around the campfire I sensed he is carrying a heavy emotional burden. He is very caring, considerate and very well in tune with himself especially after he told me about his upbringing including a mother addicted to heroin, etc. He apparently grew up in a terrible environment for any child yet somehow he was always positive and level headed. I could tell by his words that he had a lot of self doubt about himself, doubt that was unfounded. Being a military commander I saw many kids far less grounded and mature as him yet he seemed to not be able to see that in himself. I finally turned to him and told him that he should be proud of how good he is and how well he has come through this past. I went on to tell him that I would have been honored to have someone like him in my unit and to never let go of his dreams. He was silent and I assumed he had tuned me out so I looked over and in the glimmer of the campfire I could see tears running down his cheek. He turned and smiled as he left the campfire. After he left I reflected how many of us had come from dysfunctional families, yet here was an individual that used his past as a springboard to being a better person. I knew that someday he would find himself and seeing how he loved Riley that he would also be a great parent and a great person.I wondered if I was suppose to be on this trip for him, but quickly decided against. Both my spiritual and scientific beliefs do not support that we have specific destinies. Instead I believe that life always provides us opportunities and that a god does not interfere but rather have given us the skills to decide if and how we approach opportunities that are in front of us. I went to bed that night hoping that somehow I gave Daniel hope because I know his determination will take him places he never imagined as long as he never gave up. I will always wonder how Daniel grows and will always imagine a great life for him that he deserves.The next morning Riley and I are off to get to Shook Park. I got there Wednesday late in the day only to again see trail angels set up next to the beach with food and drinks. Even Riley got hotdogs and treats. There were about 12 hikers there. The next five miles were closed to any camping because of bears and required us to hike through without stopping. Wednesday was a big day for Riley and I and I did not have the energy to go further so I was planning to simply camp out next to the water as did several other hikers. Around 7pm a park ranger came up to let us know that the county ran the park and that the sheriff would run us out of we camped there. After she left we bantered on what to do with several of us including myself planning to stealth camp without the sheriff seeing us. We sat on a park picnic table when another hiker came in with a 12 pack of beer. We talked as it got dark waiting to set up tents after sunset. Next to us were teenagers – 2 boys and 2 girls – acting as you would expect on a beach with daddy’s car. One decided to drive on the beach and ran his undercarriage into the ground and got stuck. His friends helped and they finally got the car unstuck. We then began to clap and laugh at them. Another hiker brought up a radar shot on his phone only to see a monster thunderstorm barreling down on us. WE decided we had no choice and to take a chance with the sheriff. WE grabbed out gear and headed for the park pavilion just in time as the rain began and lighting all around. Around 9 pm the sheriff arrived in the park and saw eight of us sitting on benches under cover. He just waived then drove further down. About a minute later the kids drove out with the sheriff right behind. As he passed he just waived again. About an hour later a pickup truck with two huge monster confederate flags hanging on the back bumpers only to be followed right behind by the sheriff. Again as he passed he simply waved to us. Again about a minute later out came the truck with the sheriff right behind and again he just waived. He had no intent of running us off and we appreciated his understanding as the storm continued into the night.For me this was a special evening as I never just sat around with seven other guys I never knew before, yet we all seemed like we knew each other for years exchanging stories and lies like guys do. Not one bad word spoken, only fun and bantering until we got out our sleeping gear, found a dry spot under the roof and went to sleep.We were awoken the next morning around 7am when again trail angels arrived to cook us breakfast of eggs and pancakes. Several of the hikers left to finish hiking into Damascus. Cool Hand apparently came in after midnight and had the same plan as I so we hiked to the main road and got a ride all the way into Damascus.","Erwin TN

Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533815,"Thursday through Saturday – May 12, 13, 13 – Trail Days, Damascus VAArrived in Damascus on Thursday afternoon. Vendors were beginning to set up displays and the town was in full swing of final preparations. Hikers were allowed in town but nothing official would begin until Friday morning. Trail days is really a combination of two events,: First is the official portion with music, food, parades and events. Second is the unofficial portion which occurs in Tent City, a fenced in area along the river in the woods where most hikers set up their tents for the weekend. Think of this portion more like a mini-version of Burning Man.In the Tent City several vendors set up to assist hikers in repairing or replacing gear. My hiking boots were more appropriate for Colorado with Thinsulate for cold weather and snow. The last few weeks my feet would sweat so bad that my socks were soaked by the end of a day. I stopped by a new manufacturer called Vasque. I looked at several but decided to move on. I approached the Backpacker magazine booth and talked to the rep explaining my needs. He sent me back to Vasque booth highly recommending them so off I went. After trying out several shoes I settled on one and asked the price handing them my credit card. The rep there asked if I would wear a pair of their socks with their logo and next thing I know I am walking out with them for free – WOW I was thrilled. Next over to Osprey backpacks because I lost a lot of fat in the stomach and the pack slid over my skinny hips. Twenty minutes later I had a completely refitted pack with new harness – again for free. Hey this Trail Days is great.That night the fire department held a massive dinner feast for everyone. I returned to the hostel campsite for the evening. After looking over the Tent City I was fearful of Riley in that area as the estimated number of campers was over 10,000 in the woods. That turned out to be a good decision. The hostel held a bean bag tournament and then a campfire. A local band began playing rock music a few blocks away and Riley and I fell asleep in our tent to the music. All in all a great first day.The next day the events started. I got a haircut, foot wash and massage and lots and lots of food everywhere for the hikers – all free and donated. There were several weddings in the tent city including a hostel owner that invited all of the hikers to the ceremony and BBQ dinner afterwards. I wandered into Tent City after dinner to meet up with friends. Off to one side was a huge area set aside for what would be a huge campfire. At 9pm I could hear the sounds of drums indicating the start of the fire so Riley and I headed back into Tent City. The crown was massive around the fire and looked more like a scene out of Brave Heart with William Wallace. Thousands of hikers were bare top painted in war paint on their bodies and faces dancing circles around the fire, drinking beer and smoking pot. I knew then Riley and I did not belong. This was the first time I felt out of place generationally. This was for the young and wild and that was not me. Saturday I continued to go to events including the talent contest and participated in the hikers parade. This was no small parade with thousands of hikers marching down main street while the towns people soaked us with water guns, water cannons and anything else that would launch water at us. By the end of the parade Riley and I were soaked. I had fun but Riley did not seem to be pleased getting wet. I went over to the local food store and bought myself two pork chops, some salad and Hawaiian Bread and cooked it on the grill back at the hostel campground. Great meal to end a great day and fun event as I would be heading back 47 miles to where I got off the trail.Sunday through Tuesday – May 15, 16, 17 – Lake Watauga Shook Beach to Damascus – 47 milesReturned to point where I got off the Appalachian Trail to attend Trail Days in Damascus. Made a sign and put on the back of my backpack with the words “Lake Watauga Hampton” and began walking with Riley on the main street of Damascus. Within about three blocks a man pulled up to give us a ride. He was a section hiker in town for Trail Days and was headed that way.Commissioner texted me he was between Roan Mountain and Laurel Falls and would not reach the lake until Monday.There was a sign at the lake pavilion indicating that hikers must continue nonstop for the next five miles because of active bears in the area. The first shelter area as closed for camping. I came to the lake dam on the northwest side of the lake. As I crossed, I could see that the dam was several hundred feet high and a huge open valley below giving me the view of just how deep the lake was. It was a cold and sunny day and even hiking I needed to keep both my sweatshirt and rain jacket on to keep warm. I reached the Vandervetter Shelter around five and decided to stop there for the day. There were three other hikers there already and we chatted on how few hikers were on the trail. We guessed that many of the hikers that jumped ahead for trail days decided to forge ahead rather than make up missed miles. The shelter provided a beautiful view of the lake and town below. By 7pm it was getting very cold so everyone decided to head for their tents and call it a night. This was going to be my first night in the new warm weather sleeping bag along with the Reactor liner and down blanket. I saw a package of hand warmers in the shelter left behind so I decided to try and place one in the foot area of the sleeping bag. It worked and I slept through the night nice and warm.In the morning Riley and I headed off with the goal of reaching Low Gap 18 miles away as the forecast was for rain overnight. By mid afternoon we reached a hug open field that was leased to a rancher with cows wandering all around. When they saw us they all came running towards us. It scared Riley and he hiked between my legs as the cows followed us for about a mile.I came across a hiker coming the other direction asking if I had seen seven women who were slack packing. He was their ride. We chatted for a few minutes. I reached Low Gap around 7pm and began to set up the tent but the rains began before I could finish. I quickly finished and threw my backpack and Riley into the tent. By now everything was wet and we still did not have dinner yet. We ate in the tent being very careful to not drop anything in the tent. By 8 I took the food out and hung it in a tree then crawled back in with Riley for the night. I saw I had cell coverage so I called Marilee to chat and tell her that I missed her. We chatted for a while then I went to sleep. Even with most things wet I stayed warm. The rains picked up and it poured all night. Riley woke up growling nonstop so I took the flashlight and shined it out the door. Of course I was on high alert and it took about an hour to fall back to sleep.The next morning it was still raining and I had to pack my gear while still in the tent with Riley. It did not make much difference as most items were wet anyway. We crossed the road where two men were cleaning up huge amounts of trash left by hikers travelling to trail days. Sadly I see this a lot especially at the shelters. We chatted for a few minutes. The rain continued and the trail was now a river of mud. Today would be 15 miles back to Damascus. By mid afternoon the rains stopped and I came across the same hiker I met yesterday waiting for his slack packer group. We talked as he gave me cheese and crackers, a soda and a banana. I was starving because I did not eat breakfast. When I left him I took the wrong path. After about a mile I realized I was going down the mountain rather than up and rather than turn back I decided to blaze a path back up the mountain. I should have turned around as it took me an hour to climb the steep grade through thick brush and trees. When I reached the top I was hot, sweating and exhausted only to realize that I was almost back to the point where I started – RATS – an hour lost and now out of water. By this point the trail was so muddy that you simply slide around in two inches of mud. Those new shoes that I got at Trail Days was covered. I reached Damascus around 5pm and went back to the same hostel / camping area that I stayed for Trail Days.Around 9pm Commissioner texted me that he decided to do a monster day of 32 miles and was about one hour out of Damascus hiking with his headlamp. We met up at the hostel and decided to take tomorrow as a down day so I could dry my stuff and he could rest his feet.","Damascus
",Damascus Trail Days and make up hiking,"May 13, Fri",43
Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535260,"Wednesday – May 14 – Damascus Down DayToday was a down day. Commissioner decided we needed to have a real dinner and invited most of the hikers at Woodchuck hostel to join us at the Old Mill, a combination hotel and restaurant/bar. About 15 people showed up. As I looked around there was no DQ or Bandito or Socks, etc. Trail Days completely disrupted the hiking patterns and for the first time since starting the hike in Georgia I was now sitting with people I never met before or even knew their trail names. At first it was awkward and uncomfortable trying to talk with people I did not know. I was quietly pouting missing the people that I became comfortable around and now I felt like the fifth wheel. At my table was Swamp Fox, a 70 something section hiker that since 2013 has been completing sections of the trail and already completed nearly 1600 miles of it. Salsa was a 30something wife of a marine stationed at Quantico, while Chaco and Headshot were friends completing the trail together. Karma was a 20 something woman that I came across way back before Great Smokey Mountains. The only person I had a connection with was Commissioner.We got to the restaurant around 5pm and you could see the town was still recovering from Trail Days. The place was woefully understaffed and the hostess was also the waitress and bartender. She let us know that service was slow but we did not mind. AS the evening progressed, we began a game of answering questions like which section of the trail did you hat the most, or, what was the best trail magic you encountered. Within an hour I all but forgot that the people I knew were no longer around and most likely not to be seen again. Having a common agenda complete with stories of pain and agony interspersed with fun and laughing quickly was the glue that bonded people together. We sat there well past 10 pm just talking and by the end of the evening I was thrilled to meet new people with the hopes of seeing them on the trail.Thursday – May 19 – Damascus to Lost Mountain – 11.5 milesToday began the push for Grayson Highlands State Park three days out. This place has been advertised since the beginning as one of the most beautiful spots, a high mountain area above 5000 feet with huge open fields and wild horses running everywhere. I was excited to see something different then what is becoming a boring daily ritual of hiking on top of ridges in a tunnel of green on a terrible trail with deep ruts up to two feet deep and five feet across completely eroded away leaving rocks, roots and fallen trees to weave through. Worse was on rainy days where the trail would literally turn into a river of swift flowing mud. The culprit is not overuse but the trail itself. Whoever planned the route decided that each and every single peak had to be climbed resulting in paths straight down the mountain and ripe for erosion. I found it interesting while in town that the front page of the local newspaper was addressing that very problem and the permanent environmental damage that will take centuries to recover from. I assumed the trail would follow gorgeous rivers and streams or through thick forest. That vision quickly evaporated as the entire trail so far is always following the top of every ridge and to every mountain top, a policy that is both brutal with no purpose and unacceptable damage to our forest. AS I hiked the rain began and clouds moved in quickly. While on the trail outside of Damascus I came to an intersection with a blue blaze trail, a local trail, and I could hear children playing in the distance. Riley and I needed a break and lunch so I took the blue blaze and within a 100 yards there lay a small community with a restaurant along the Virginia Creeper Trail. The Virginia Creeper Trail in a converted railroad route into a hiking and biking trail and literally paralleled the Appalachian by about a 100 yards. It is 34 miles long. A huge sign stated “The world’s best chocolate cake” and what could be more enticing to a hiker than food, especially dessert. So Riley and I decided to eat there and yes the cake was awesome. I downed it with a huge glass of milk, something I had not had in 45 days. I sat outside under a shelter and cold see both the Creeper trail and the Appalachian trail running next to it other than the Appalachian was at the top of the ridge about a 100 feet higher and could hear hikers talking. Other hikers also stopped and we decided to follow the Creeper for a couple of miles to rejoin the Appalachian rather than backtrack. That was a great decision as the Creep followed a mountain rive full with waterfalls, beaver dams, trout fisherman, etc. I began to question the wisdom of the AT planners on why the need to create a second trail right next to such an awesome trail bypassing everything it had to offer. When we did reconnect , once again back onto a rutted trail with nothing to see other than your feet and rocks and mud.Got to Lost Mountain Shelter and settled in for the night. Rain was intermittent. Another hiker named Mayo was playing his guitar to 70s and 80s rock classics. He was a pretty good player and I enjoyed the music. Another hiker came in announcing the forecast was for rain all day Friday and Saturday with very cold temps in the mountains. Friday – May 20th – Lost Mountain to Thomas Knob in Grayson Highlands State ParkRain was already heavy when I woke up and I knew today was going to be a miserable day. A huge hike up to 5500 feet in constant rain, high winds and mud everywhere. Crossed an open field where horses ran and Riley promptly rolled on his back in horse poop. But of course he did ! Got to Thomas Knob after 13 grueling miles of slippery, rocky, washed out hiking. My boot and pant were covered in mud and I was soaked through and through from both rain and sweat. Riley promptly fell asleep and I decided we were going to sleep in the shelter rather than set up the tent. That turned out to be the right decision. By 5:30 the fog was so thick you could not see 50 feet. Winds were whipping and it rained all night long. The shelter had two levels enough to accommodate 16 hikers. We were full and as new hikers came along they had to continue hiking to the next shelter 10 miles away. I felt sorry for them but glad I settled here as Commissioner and I briefly pondered attempting to hike on today. WE sat in the shelter talking but by 7pm everyone decided to go o sleep as there was nothing else to do other than try to stay warm and dry. It poured all night including thunderstorms and temps in the upper 30s.Saturday – May 21 – Thomas Knob through Sunday May 22The original plan from Thomas Knob was to enter the state park and see all of the wonders and wld horses but that was not to be. WE had two options, hike in the heavy rain and fog and miss everything or simply shortcut across to where the trail exited the park and head down into the small town of Troutville where a church ran a hiker hostel. I decided to head for the hostel with the intent of trying to hitch a ride back up tomorrow and slack pack the section we skipped. It was twelve miles down the mountain and into the town. AS we descending we came across a foal and its parents. Riley started to approach the foal and dad quickly stepped between Riley and the small horse. It took a very defensive and menacing stance and I knew that if Riley got closer he would get kicked. I kept yelling at him to heal all while grabbing him. The hostel was very well maintained and nice. We go there midafternoon so decided to hitch a ride into Marion 16 miles away to get a hot dinner and resupply at the local Walmart Superstore there. We got picked up within minutes as most people know there are AT hikers everywhere. After dinner and shopping we got another ride back to the hostel from a local who told me the forecast for Sunday was sunny and warmer – just what I hoped for.Sunday morning came and the sky was still cloudy and misting. I could see breaks and had high hopes for a clear day. Around 8 the preacher’s wife came up to the hostel with an breakfast egg dish, pancakes, fruit and coffee. What a great surprise. We all felt a little guilt knowing services would start soon so we decided to be respectful and sit on the Sunday services. I even brought Riley into the church. The pastor welcomed all of the hikers there as we nearly outnumbered the locals. Until now I forgot that I was in the Bible Belt of America where religion and Christianity is the centerpiece of many small communities. The sermon was a typical fire and brimstone speech on sinning. I think he may have been talking about me as I kept looking at the sky through the windows expecting a lightning bolt to come through and strike me. Cool Hand was also there so after services Cool Hand and Commissioner decided to hitch back to Marion while myself and Karma hitched a ride back up to Grayson Highlands State Park. We covered the 13 miles we missed the day before in five hours and got to see everything I had hoped for. The weather was perfect and Riley had a field day chasing everything that moved. I only brought a raincoat, come food and water and was able to move quickly without 40 pounds on my back. Karma and I got back to the park parking lot around 7pm and there were only five cars left in the lot that was full when we first got there. We panicked a little as the temperature was dropping fast and the sun setting behind the mountain. This was a dead end road and there would be no traffic to try and hitch back to the hostel. A local trail runner came and we asked if he could give us a ride down at least to a major cross road. At first he was hesitant because he had a large dog and it appeared Riley and the dog would not get along. AT first he walked away but returned about five minutes later indicating he wanted to see if the dogs would get along as he knew that our chances of getting down that night were running out quickly. Good thing the two dogs liked each other. He was a local attorney and he knew Karma from her blog as he was interested in reading the hiker blogs. We had a great conversation and he took us directly back to the hostel, going out of his way. I tried to give him gas money but he refused.Commissioner was already at the hostel with 10 Arby Roast Beef Sandwiches for us. A perfect finish to what turned out to be a perfect and fun day.Monday – May 23 through Friday 27 – Troutdale to Bland – MM 589Monday morning up and out back to the trail. At the trail head was more Trail Magic and a Trail Angle handing out breakfast of Sausage and Biscuit Gravy, OJ, fruit and coffee. We ate then headed out. After 8.5 miles we crossed the road we started from just tow miles further down. What !!! 8.5 miles yet only two miles from where we started. Yes more of that destructive trail routing to hit every single top and ridge. We snaked back and forth without missing a peak, bypassing other options along a river of course. I am beginning to get bored seeing the same thing every day, especially knowing there is a lot more beauty that is being bypassed just to stay on the top of every mountain and ridge. Stopped for the night about 4 miles past Trimpi Shelter in a campground. For the first time in weeks the wood was dry enough to start a campfire. Two other hikers joined us and we sat around the fire and chatted until bedtime.Tuesday was a plan to hike 17 miles into Atkins as Karma was having new poles sent to her there. It was a long day but not too much up and down as in past day. I reached the Mount Rodger National Wilderness Headquarters around noon and took a visit. A shelter was set up there as well that included running toilets, shower, power, etc. Even firewood was there. This was one of the best shelters I have seen to date. I continued another 9 miles into Atkins. I came across a Settlers Museum a couple miles short of Atkins. Trail Magic was set up so another free and highly welcomed lunch and snacks. Niothing taste better than a cold soda after hiking 14 miles in warm weather. Both Commissioner and Karma were already there in town when I arrived around 7pm. We split the cost of a cheap hotel called the Relax Inn and went over to the gas station next door where there was also a Mexican diner. For 7 bucks is was a great meal and lots of it. I bought a couple of bottles of Henry’s Hard Ginger Ale and relaxed back at the hotel giving Marilee a call. We had not chatted in almost a week and I was missing her.Wednesday departed Atkins for Knot Mall Gap. Not feeling well and had an upset stomach all day. Hoped it was not Norivirus – which it turned out not to be. Commissioner and Karma remained at Atkins still waiting her poles. Nothing new about the hike today but had great weather. I crossed a road about three miles short of the Gap where Trail Angels were again set up. Riley and I stopped for food and of course a cold soda. They were telling me about two new hostels that just opened in the area including one called the Appalachian Dreamer Hiker Hostel which picked up hikers at several crossings. Around 5:30 I reached one of the crossing knowing the shuttle would come by in a few minutes and pondered just going to a hostel for the night. I was exhausted and I could see Riley beginning to show signs of fatigue from 8 straight days of hiking without a break. At the last second I decided to head for the shelter instead.Woke up Thursday morning and regretting my decision to not go to the hostel. Every muscle ached and Riley literally skipped dinner the night before and fell asleep for 14 straight hours. Today was going to be hot and humid – a first on this hike. We took off and got to a USFS road after 6 miles around noon to stop for lunch. Another hiker I have seen before was there and tried to go on up a big 4500 foot climb but returned 30 minutes later unable to climb because of an injury. We chatted as she was trying to figure how to get down into a town to see a doctor as she had injured her ankle and it was swollen. I told her about the hostel and how close it was. I could see she needed help and that was enough of an excuse for me to stop hiking and go back to that hostel. I needed a day off as everything hurt and I was simply out of steam and emotionally drained. I indicated if she could walk about three or four miles on the dirt road we would get to the cross street where the hostel van picked up hikers. Off we went but within five minutes a truck came from behind and gave us a ride down the mountain.When we got down, she went on to the next town where there was a clinic but to my benefit there was a hiker I ran across several times over the last two months. He is a retired Marine Sergeant Major there with his girlfriend. He also injured his knee when he fell and was taking a few days off. His girlfriend brought him a knee brace to continue after he rested a few days. I was able to slackpack 26 miles over the remainder of today and tomorrow covering the first 12 miles in just four hours getting back before dinner and the next morning covering the 14 miles also under 4 hours as it was all downhill – and without 40 pounds on my back. Riley and I flew and were done just after lunchtime – still early enough to get to the library in Bland VA to update my journal. Riley and I are holed up in a little hotel here and will take tomorrow, Saturday off at a minimum. I am not sure where Commissioner and Karma are but I left him a text that I am in town.","Damascus

Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536078,"Saturday – May 28th through Wednesday June 1st – Bland VA to Pearisburg VA – 45 milesDeparted Bland Saturday Helveys Gap, a three mile hike. We resupplied in Bland, ate lunch then headed out midafternoon. Arrived at the campsite along with about two dozen other hikers. This was the first night in weeks with great weather, and a warm evening. We built a huge campfire and enjoyed well into to the evening the warm without any cold air or rain.Riley got excited when he saw Blue, another dog he has known most of the trip and they ran and wrested for hours amongst the campers. What sounded like light rain overnight was actually heavy fog forming on the trees and falling like rain. Sunday up early to hike 16 miles to the Trent Grocery store and campground just short of Dismal Falls. For the first time I actually enjoyed the trail as it followed creeks and rivers, with only a few ups and downs. I actually was whistling songs as I hiked. Riley ran after a squirrel and startled three huge owls from a tree that flew over our heads. Their wing span was about 5 feet yet you could not hear any sound as they flew over us. Came down a mountain and crossed Dismal River on a foot suspension bridge high above the canyon floor. Riley did not seem to mind the swinging bridge as we walked. Just as I reached the grocery store a light rain began so I decided to camp at their campground instead of heading a few more miles to a shelter area. Within a few minutes both Commissioner and Cool Hand showed up alongside me. The campground offered both hot showers and laundry as part of the camping fee on only $6 so I washed clothes and got cleaned up. The rain ceased and other hikers arrived to set up camp as well. As this ws the holiday weekend many hikers continues the few extra miles to Dismal Falls as they heard there would be a big party there, something I wanted to avoid. Another hiker in his mid-fifties arrived in a big truck and introduced himself as Screech. He broke his ankle the first week of hiking and decided rather than go home he would stay and act as a trail angel for his daughter who was also hiking the trail. She had grouped up with about 30 people and the back of his truck was full of gear. He said he loved continuing the trip with his daughter and had no regrets he could not finish. She arrived as well and was very vocal how she was proud of him for staying with and thankful for him helping out. We again had good weather for another huge campfire as the sky began to clear. As night came on the forest filled up with fireflies that lit up the forest on the mountainsides. It was an awesome site. The clouds move out and we could see all of the stars. Off to the far low south we could see a bright white object streaking across the sky. It clearly was not an airplane and too bright for a regular satellite so we assumed it had to be the space station. This was a perfect end to another great day.Commissioner indicated that his parents would not be able to meet us in Pearisburg the next weekend so we decided to hike 16 miles on Monday from Trent to the Woods Hole Hostel. I left early morning as it was going to be a hot day. Again the trail followed a route that followed the Dismal River. As I approached the Dismal Falls I was glad I did not decide to camp there. It was full with little space to camp and everyone there in a party mood, jumping into the river from the falls. There was only one hard climb then followed the ridgeline all the way to Woods Hole Hostel. Along the way I came across a huge three foot long black snake that I did not know what it was. It was just laying across the trail like a branch and I literally jumped into the air when I realized it was a snake. It looked at Riley and ignored us s we ran quickly away from it. The hostel was one of the best I have seen. I was met with a quart of homemade cookie dough ice cream and a hot loaf of homemade bread. Riley crawled into the bunk and fell asleep right away. They provided a dinner that was all gown on the farm and organic. By now I was both stuffed and in need of a shower. By nightfall we built another campfire and just sat and chatted until 11pm before going to bed. Breakfast the next day was eggs, French toast, great coffee and toast with homemade apple butter. The place also offered massages so I scheduled one for mid-morning. Sixty minutes later after the massage I crawled over to a hammock hanging on the porch and took a nap. Wow my body was so happy and I forgot all of the torture I had endured over the last few weeks. The hostel was also a working farm that included chickens, goats, cows, ducks and two other dogs so Riley and the dogs ran around the farm all day. At one time I saw them inside the goat fenced area eating with the goats who did not seem to mind. I think Riley enjoyed the day off as well as I did.Again dinner was prepared for the hikers, today was fajitas. Along came Dr Longspoon and Silly, the two that stopped to help me with Riley way back at Neels Gap Georgia when he was freezing. I had been nearly six weeks since I saw them last and I was happy to see them again. We sat on the porch well into the evening just catching up on our trips.Wednesday morning I got up around 6am and was ready to leave by 7:30. Goal today was 11 miles into Pearisburg to get a package Marilee mailed me and to resupply. Today was both an easy and beautiful hike high along the ridge line overlooking the valley below with no climbs, just one desend at the end into town. The trees along the trail began to bloom purple flowers. As I hiked IU came across three women hiking together as they sang the bridal march from weddings. I stopped and talked with them and laughed as they pretended the forest was the isle for the bride to walk down surrounded by flowers and pedals covering the trail floor. AS I neared Pearisburg, I reached the Angels Rest, a rock outcropping that was about two thousand feet above the town with a view of the entire valley floor below.I sent Marilee some pics to post for me and we will talk tonight as both Riley and I miss her. Too bad she could not be part of this, at least the view parts. She is a good person and I love her.","Woods Hole Hostel
",Pearisburg,"Jun 01, Wed",46
Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538525,"Thursday June 2 through Saturday June 17 – Pearisburg to Rockfish Gap VA – 225 miles in 16 days – Average 14 miles a day.First off Marilee is also posting pictures on our Face Book so please feel free to go there and look or leave messages. Our Facebook Page is “SCAMPING WE WILL GO”Departed Thursday from Pearisburg with the first stop for the night at Rice Field. After a climb to 3400 feet, the next few weeks would be some of the best hiking I have done so far. The climbs are beginning to thin out on a daily basis and the views are much better. The trail at times begins to follow creeks and better views and in good shape so my daily miles completed began to climb. I am now up to 11 miles a day average over the entire route with a goal to reach an average of 12 per day which would make the entire trip right around the six month mark – end of September or early October.On the way up to Rice field I came across Full throttle, a 52 year old retired broker. We were about a mile from the shelter when we met and by the time we got to the top, the sky was dark with a major thunderstorm building right behind. Along came Darkness (Bear Wall) and Slosh/Scavenger, a British couple who completed a year of hiking in Chile and Peru and now were trying to complete the Appalachian Trail. Without a doubt this would be my best night sleeping on the trail.The area on top was void of trees as this use to be a grazing field high above the valley and small towns thousands of feet below. The view was awesome looking to the west into West Virginia and to the east into Virginia. The English couple planned to continue hiking up to a camping area a few miles up the trail. We watched them disappear over the top of the hill and into the woods about a half mile away. A few minutes later I see them returning to the shelter. As they ran towards the shelter I jokingly asked them if they were lost, to which they told me to look behind the shelter. So we all got out and looked around the corner at a monster storm building right over our heads. We all decided to run into the open field to get a better view of the storm which was getting very impressive in both size and the speed it began to move at. We could see the clouds passing below us and above us at an incredible speed with lightning in the background and strong winds bending the trees. It reminded me of living in Minnesota in the summer sitting on the porch and watching storms roll across the plain states. Within a few minutes we felt the first drops of rain so we scrambled back over the field fence to the shelter Just in time before the sky opened up with a deluge of rain that would last over an hour. As we stayed dry in the shelter we had more hikers running towards us to get to the shelter that got caught in the rain while hiking. They were all soaked.We were also smart enough to grab wood and throw it under the shelter to keep dry. AS the rain stopped and the thunderstorms began to fall apart we started a fire and decided to go back to the filed to watch the sunset along with the storms now in the distance with lightning dancing across the twilight sky. I sat on the top of the fence ladder and Riley joined me sitting right next to me as if he was also enjoining the views. You could see almost a hundred miles in all directions of rural Americana. Below were the faint lights of small town homes with an occasional car on a country road. This must have been what it was like hundreds of years ago other than now electric lights and cars instead of oil lamps and horse buggies. The sky was a brilliant array of orange reds and blue colors as stars began to pop out. I was probably looking at 30 thousand square miles of what had to be some of the most beautiful views. In the evening sky was three hawks floating in the winds coming over the top of the field. They flew at eye level in front of us silently and effortlessly floating along the ridge to find prey. Off in the distant you could hear a train whistle blowing and a plane flying overhead. It was so quiet and peaceful and could hear the sound of the plane for a nearly ten minutes, something that does not happen in a city because of all of the other noises. It was all in all a perfect night and the most enjoyable I had all trip, a true period of complete peace and serenity.Left Rice Field in the morning in what would be the beginning of more along ridge paths at the top instead of constant ups and downs. A heavy fog set up overnight on the mountain top giving an eerie sense to the trail. AS the sun burnt away the fog, you could see down into the small towns and hamlets below. The trail crossed several large open fields full of flowers and both raspberry and blackberry plants beginning to bloom their fruit. Too bad I was not here a couple of weeks later to enjoy the fruits. It reminded me of our trip with Marilee in Washington State waking up to eating blackberries everywhere we went and camped. I connected with both Bear Wall and No-Name as we hiked all day and came to a stop called The Captains, a private home next to the trail where the owner allows hikers to camp on his property. The trail was on one side of the river and his house on another so he installed a zip line to cross the river. It was quite a challenge to get myself, Riley and our backpacks across without falling off into the water. Just like yesterday we got there just minutes before another large storm and heavy rains started. When the rain stopped we decided to move on another five miles to avoid starting a large hill first thing the next morning, choosing to get it out of the way today. When the rain stopped, the sun returned as did the high humidity making those five miles miserable. Bear Wall told me the story and showed me the video he took of his bear encounter back at Lake Watauga. Apparently Commissioner decided to be a trail angle by getting a dozen cheeseburgers and hand them out on the north side of the lake – the same north size with big warning signs he failed to see that there was no stopping or camping because of active bears. The group after getting the burgers came across a mom with her two cubs. The mom charged the group and everyone other than Bear Wall ran instead of standing together and waiving their poles in the air. So mom charged Bear Wall who now was standing alone. He screamed at them to return which they did and mom stopped about five yards short of Bear Wall. He said for a moment te thought he was going to get mauled. He showed me the picture of the bear just in front of him and she was a big bear by any standard. By the time I got to the shelter area I and Riley were both exhausted and soaked with sweat. I literally sat down in a stream, clothes and all to cool off and to wash the stink out of the clothes a littler. It felt good to actually be clean getting into the sleeping bag.Saturday departed Bailey Gap for Warspur only nine miles away. Today was a terribly hot day and I could see Riley exhausted. Warspur also was along a creek so I again sat in the creek upon arrival to cool off and wash away the sweat. As evening came yet another large storm popped up washing out the campfire we started earlier. I was now running with a different group to include Bear Wall, No Name, Slosh and Scavenger. We chatted and made clean fun of the English who claimed they were here to return America to England. Bear Heart, a Minnesota Paramedic joined us coming in soaked from the rain. Slosh told us that he already lost 50 pounds from the hiking and that they had visited Colorado before coming here with the sole intent of spending three days smoking pot. They admitted that they got more than they could use and left it for others. We laughed as they told us that they had to prove they had enough money to be in this country to get a travel visa.Moving each day was much like life. When you came to a shelter, others would help you, pointing out where the water was and ensuring space on the table to take your backpack off. It became clear that life is supposed to be an adventure and that any adventure will be full of surprises, things that will go wrong and experiences you never thought could happen making all of the hard work OK. My sister Gail asked me if I was having fun. It took me a day to come up with the right answer as fun is not really part of the equation, or at least the actual hiking portion of the adventure. Each day was filled with long days hiking in brutal climbs or trail conditions, filled with bugs and dirt everywhere. I thought about it and answered that this was an experience that I am both glad I am doing and completing and one that I would always remember. It is a great trip with experiences I never could have planned for or imagined that I would never trade away. The end of each day, with the camaraderie, the night sky and stars along with a hot meal washed away all of the days pains and misery – just like real life. The lesson here was knowing that to be alive really meant that you shared you experiences with family and friends and that taking a chance leads to experiences you will take with you throughout life. More important is that most things require hard work, gets easier as you keep going and enjoy the trip as much as the intended destination or goal.Marilee and I took a four month trip around the west states. We had both great times and stressful times but now I only remember the great times I had with her. We saw fish hatcheries, oceans, coastal fog, and night skies filled with meteors and stars. This hike is much like that trip other than she is not with me. Without a doubt some of the best moments of this trip will be with Riley sitting with me or just being part of the group. When I flip, he will be headed back to Colorado and Marilee and I will miss him a lot.As we hiked I came across a huge pile of bear poop, so I began to whistle and sing songs and kept Riley close by my side for a while. Today was a light rain and cool breeze that felt good. We came across the Keffer Oak tree, supposedly the largest tree east of the Mississippi. Its girth was huge and the trunk was about 6 feet across holding up this stately oak. The trail wandered back and forth from inside the woods to open fields and streams until reaching Sarver Gap and the best shelter I have seen on the trail to date.Left Sarver knowing that I was down to one day of dog food so any plans had to include getting to a local store just ahead. We passed the Audie Murphy memorial, a sign where he died in a plane crash on top of the ridge line. The 4 pines hostel was a full day of hiking but included hiking the Dragons’ Tooth – a terrible and dangerous section of trail that required you to scramble over boulders the size of buses that had rebar embedded for something to hold on to. Without this was one of the worst planned sections to have hikers come through here. Several hikers coming the other way stopped to tell me that they were scared for Riley because it was so dangerous to climb down. After about ten minutes of trying I abandoned this scramble and backtracked to a road I crossed about a mile back and went down and around direct to the hostel. The hostel was more like a frat house than a hostel. Large sofas filled a three car garage and most people were either playing games, drinking, smoking or outside playing bean bag toss with the owner.Tuesday morning headed out for what is the most photographed section of the entire trail – McAfee’s Knob,, a huge granite slap of mountain sticking out 300 feet above the valley floor. As you stood on it you felt like you were floating in air – because you were. A couple of pics with Riley and lunch before we moved on.As I hiked I began to think about my medical situation that I seem to want to avoid. I am a cancer survivor first diagnosed back in late 2008. I was still in the Air Force but never told my supervisor or unit as I knew that day that my military career was over. If I told them I would be medically assigned to a special status and likely either forced to turn over my position to someone else or retired. I stopped my Air War College needed to get promoted to Colonel as I knew no such promotion would be in my future. Instead I planned how I would end my career on a high note and leave my unit in the best shape possible. I completed surgery and several months of radiation therapy. I kept this from everyone other than Marilee and close family and friends. It was a sad day when I talked to my commander when we talked about my future. Instead of telling him the details, I simply left him knowing that I prefer to be retired without a lot of fanfare. My last two years was both a rewarding yet sad time for me as my life I had was coming to an end. My biggest fear now is that it will all come back. Most people do not understand that and try to make you feel good that you were cured, but….. you are not cured and every time I go to get tested I am in constant fear that I will bet bad news. So I have stopped going for test because I simply do not want to know. This trip has both forced me to face reality and also to give me something to achieve in my life rather than dwell on my cancer.I hiked in on Friday into Daleville VA. Overall a great hike and great end to a week of hiking other than the last few miles that forced us to hike below power lines in brutal heat and a terrible trail into town. Commissioner came in behind me and we joined his parents and sister for dinner. They came to visit him and see how he is doing. The next morning we went to breakfast then I headed out while Commissioner took his family back about 20 miles to McAfee Knob to see the site. He also had to make those miles up as he hitched into Daleville to get there in time for his family. So right now he should be about two days behind me.Leaving Daleville began the last of the mostly ups and downs as we closed in on the Blue Ridge Mountains Parkway (BRMP)with Shenandoah National Park just a week away. I was now more than 700 miles into the trip and looking forward to better trails ahead. I made it about 22 miles that day and decided to literally camp on top of the BRMP area. There was an overlook and parking lot. With a hige grass field behind it. I decided to sleep cowboy style under the stars with just a sleeping back. Big Sky came up and decided to do the same. It was illegal to camp so close to the woods but we figured the ranger would not care as long as we did not cause problems. The weather was perfect. A storm in the far distance lit up the evening sky as we watched sunset over the mountains and valley below. Yet another perfect night on the Appalachian Trail. I talked to Paul, my friend in D.C. regarding dates to arrive at Front Royal to meet him. My decision to send Riley back to Marilee was not set in stone and I knew it was the right decision. Sleeping with Riley that night under the stars was sad knowing that Riley had only three weeks left with me. I can tell he is tiring each day and concerned that carrying a backpack everyday might cause long term health issues. He is still growing and that is a long time to carry weight. Also snakes are getting a lo more frequent and if Riley would get bit, it might be fatal as getting him help could take a long time to come out of the mountains and get him to a medical facility in time. This is not a chance I am willing to take and I know Marilee misses him as well.. By the time we reach Paul’s Riley will have completed nearly half of the Appalachian Trail. He is a great dog and I am so happy how well he handled the trip and how much he loved being with all of the hikers every day. By Friday, June 17, I am now only one or two days from entering Shenandoah National Park. We stopped into Waynesboro Friday to get some resupplies and will go back to slack pack the prior 20 miles before Waynesboro. I was originally going to continue another night on the trail, but the temperatures were in the mid-nineties and hiking was brutal so I hiked to the BRMP and hitched a ride into Waynesboro instead. Tomorrow will be a slack pack day then Sunday enter the National Park. I should reach Paul’s place by next Sunday, June 26th","Pearisburg

I entered the park on the south side and registered with the park ranger kiosk for the backcountry permit. AS I left the kiosk, something rattled the leaves to my right about five yards away in the trees. Riley of course immediately perked up and looked around as we both watched a bear turn tail and run away from us. Good thing Riley was on the lease at that time as he got pretty excited. For many hikers, they have already seen at least one bear but this was my first the entire trip.Many years ago I watched a special on the Discovery Channel about fireflies whose behavior baffles scientist. In the show the fire flies would all blink in the exact same pattern at the exact same time including turning off the blink. The show indicated there were only a few places on earth where this happens and scientist could not figure out how they coordinated their blinking or even why they did so. All I remember was that one such location was in the eastern United States. I talked about this several months back to other hikers when the fire flies just started coming out and several of the hikers indicated they believe that location was close to the Appalachian Trail. Well they were right and I found that location at Hilltop Mountain. Getting to Hilltop was a long day of hiking that day and I did not get there until after 9pm with very little natural light remaining. Riley and I hiked quickly as we could just barely see the trail and nothing into the woods on our sides. Every now and then we would hear a branch break and Riley would stop and peer into the woods. I on the other hand would begin to whistle tunes and hike faster as I feared one of those cracking branches might be the result of a bear or mountain lion or something else that sees me as a tasty snack stupid enough to be hiking at night without a light and alone. But we got to the shelter area by 9:15. There were several other hikers there already set up and had a campfire going. AS the fire died down I could see into the dark woods that fireflies began to come out in great quantities and within minutes I was surrounded by fireflies light up the night woods. Around 10 pm their random pattern began to change. It seemed like the fireflies were beginning to form separate group for some reason, with each group blinking together in unison but different from the other groups which by now numbered around 8 separate groups around the forest. Then without reason they began to flash in concert with each other with the first group blinking first then each group to my right starting a few seconds later and continuing around the forest in a circular pattern still keeping their unique group patterns separate from the other groups. Then all of them would stop blinking at the exact same time and remain dark for about 10 seconds. This continued for about 30 minutes. They pattern continued but after a while the blinking was now all the same across all groups even though they stared at different times much like the standing wave fans do around a stadium at baseball games. What was most amazing wat that all of the flier flies stopped at the exact same time like someone turned a switch off. At another shelter area there was a creek about five yards to the left of the shelter next to a mountain creek. Between the creek and the shelter were small bushes where a large doe stood and watched us for hours. She acted like she was trying to hider herself behind the small bushes apparently not realizing we could all see here. As new hikers approached she would simply lower her head like she was hiking as the hikers walked past her. Even Riley watched her in amazement. Of course snakes seemed in abundance on the park. Riley and I had three near experiences over the week in the park including one where I literally did not see the snake and stepped over it with Riley behind me. As Riley passed I heard the rattle going, looking down and jumped into the area realizing I just stepped over a rattle snake. On the second to the last day in the park I stopped at a wayside rest on Skyline Drive that had food. I sat outside on a park bench with other hikers enjoying a burger and fries when one of the hikers jumped up and ran towards the woods. I turned to see a smaller bear come out of the woods towards the picnic area but then climbed a tree when it spotted the hiker bearing down on it. There were four park rangers there as well and they joined in trying to chase the bear away. It was pretty cute as the bear instead climbed a tree next to the picnic tables. At first it hid in the tree behind the trunk but then peered around the corner only to see everyone looking at it. Apparently it did not realize that its big butt was sticking out the other side of the trunk for all to see.The last night in the park we decide while at the way stop to make the last night special. The camp store sold beer and wine including wind in the boxes so I got a small one (500ml) along with lots of junk food and snacks. I was not worried about the weight because we only had about two miles of hiking to go for the day. That night was a lot of fun. We built a campfire. A group of three section hikers were there as well and brought a French press to make coffee. All in all a great night and great way to complete the national park. Two of the nights I decided to camp at the park campgrounds, the first time at Loft Mountain and the second at Big Meadows. All day I was hounded by storms and when I reached Big Meadows it was already 7pm, we were wet and I started to realize Io only had a couple of nights left with Riley before he headed back to Colorado. Instead of a campground I decided to treat Riley and I to a cabin at Big Meadows. As soon as we entered the cabin Riley of course jumped up on the bed and let me know that he has found his sleeping spot for the night. I went over to the camp store and restaurant and got us both dinner including him a cooked hamburger patty with cheese.The week was a success but bittersweet as I came to accept that starting in a few days my best trail friend and hiking buddy would no longer be hiking everyday with me. I can see that Riley is exhausted every day and I am concerned having him carry a backpack for so long while he is still growing increases the odds of potential long term problems for him. Such continuous long term hiking is hard on the body and I would feel terrible if Riley grew up with ailments and problems from such a hike like this. Anyway Marilee misses him as well and would love to have him home. She told me that she does not lay out under the stars at night because she is alone and afraid, especially with the large number of coyotes and mountain lions that live around us. At least this way she will sit outside and hopefully be looking at the same stars I am looking at. I miss her and sitting out with her at night on the lounge chairs all wrapped up in blankets and look forward to do that again when I get home. I have no doubt that next week I will be sad not having Riley lay next to me under the stars or watching him chase squirrels in the forest.My friend Paul is picking me up Friday in Front Royal and I will spend the weekend with him and his family. Paul and I go back many years and we each were in the other’s wedding. Paul retired from the Air Force and remained in the Washington D.C. area as what we call the beltway bandits – contractors working under a government contract.I also got a text message from Commissioner who was behind me after leaving Daleville. He decided to catch some other hikers he knew in Hersey PA so he hitched a ride and now is many days in front of me. I have no doubt we will cross paths when I flip in July and hope he has a great hike. So with Commissioner gone I am now hiking with people I just met. Like always you feel a little sad knowing you most likely will not see someone again but also excited as you connect with new people over the miles.Last blog I talked about my cancer and again this week it rattled through my mind while I hike. It is a terrible word to hear that brings nothing but fear into you. Each day you wonder if this will be the day it returns, or cuts your life short before you have a chance to live your dreams or complete your bucket list. I did not start this journey as a bucket list item but the fear of failure combined with the risk of return always is in the back of my mind and keeps me determined to complete this hike. For years I refused to tell people of my condition on fear I would be judges poorly. It makes you feel like you are something less and broken you want to protect yourself from being seen as such. I think of my experiences this week like the fireflies and bears and come to accept that no matter what, life still has a lot of great things in store and the only way forward is to keep living each day with a sense of adventure and excitement. AS I reflected on this trip I do find it to be a great adventure and happy I had the chance to do this. Although cancer will always be in the back of my mind I plan to build and complete a bucket list – the only difference he next time is that it must include Marilee. I have and will always believe that happiness is best shared as being alone on the trail is not as rewarding without someone to share the thrills and excitements. I think Marilee would have loved to be sitting next","Rock Fish Gap Shenandoah National Park

Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540363,"Monday June 27 to Thursday June 30 - Shenandoah National Park to Harpers Ferry - 54 milesThis week has been a whirlwind of emotions. I got picked up by my friend Paul and spend the weekend with him and his family. It was a weekend to resupply, get cleaned up and rest and most important prepare and send Riley home to Marilee, We took Riley to the vet for a checkup and certificate from the vet to fly, got a cage, etc and then spend a few days with Riley. Gave him a bath to look good and also ensure no fleas or ticks. Paal and I took the dogs kyyaking on the Potomac. Then the emotional final trip with Riley to the United Airlines cargo for the flight home. It was a hard day for me. After a great weekend with them Paul returned me to the trail towards Harpers Ferry.The trail provided little new with most more of the same of hiking in a green tunnel of trees on a trail that is in very bad shape. You really could not hike but instead had to constantly step on and over miles and miles of boulders. I twisted my ankle three times and now it is sore and becoming a hinderence to my daily mileage plans. After the third trip I literally screamed as loud as I could multiple times that ""....I hate this F!!!ing trail...."" I am sure that other hikers heard me through the forest. Each day got harder and I could not keep to my daily mileage to stay on track. By the time I reached Harpers Ferry I began to question if I even wanted to continue. I had to accept that trying to maintain a daily pace to reach Maine in time before snow was not working. Several times ove the last few months I kept modifying my plan to keep pace but that was my real problem - trying to catch up that was doing more harm than good. I had already lost 22 pounds and each day I was exhausted aver ten or so miles and my pace had slowed down to 1 to 2 miles an hour. I was dejected and ready to quit then and there.I even called Marilee to get her thoughts on just quitting. I realized I needed to get to 13 or so miles every day to be safe and that did not include any down day. That was not realistic. My step daughter is getting married over Labor Day and I want to be there. That would take 5 to 6 days off. I planned to flip to ensure success but that could take another 3 to 4 days and I want to see Marilee taking another 3 or 4 days off. My mileage is now really 10 to 12 a day at best considering both my ankle and comleted loss of energy. As I sat at the ATC HQ I calculeted at best I would not get done until lat October to early November. I miss home and everything Colorado offers over the summer including biking, concerts and camping with Marilee.Quiting seemed to solve all those problems but I leterally broke down after talking to Marilee feeling like a complete failure. I slept at the ATC campground in Harpers Ferry. As I laid there I had to either make plans to go home or create a new plan - a PLAN B.So what is plan B. It starts with the idea that I will not try ot make any daily goal. Instead hike from shelter to shelter each day, stopping to see if I want to try the next otherwise call it a day there. I will not flip and save those travel days. I am going to the wedding regardless. With this plan I have set the bar low enough to take the pressure off me and decided that I will simply keep going north and on September 1st I will exit the trail and go home for the wedding. If I have not completed the entire trail by that poing then I nee to accept that I must rturn next year to finsh whatever is left over. I feel much better because I will still hike the entire trail and complete my goad and will still receive my ATC hiker certificate for completing the entire AT. The only difference is it took me two seasons instead of one. Having that plan made me feel much better than I did last night and re energized me to keep going. The only issue is how fast or slow will my ankle heal. Now instead of dreading each day and the White Mountains instead I hopefully can get back to seeing each day as a success and feeling good about myself. So with that in mind I am off from Harpers Ferry and headed to Maryland.This week did bring one great experience and that was the Bear Den Hostel run by the ATC. It is a huge old mansion on 66 acres next to multi million dollar homes. The crew here was great and the facilities more like a five star hotel instead of a hostel including hot breakfast and yes my morning coffee.","Shenandoah National Park

Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541725,"Friday July 1 Harpers Ferry through Thursday July 7 Boiling Springs PA – 98 milesThis was a huge and my most successful week. It started off on a down note per my prior posting, but ended up my most successful week with several major life milestones achieved.1.        Longest single day mileage – 30 miles hiked From Tumbling Run to Pine Furnace State Park2.        Longest weekly (ten days) total from SNP to Boiling Springs MD 153 miles3.        Longest daily average of 15+ miles per day (Over ten days)4.        Crossed half way point at 1095 miles5.        Crossed 1100 mile point6.        Completed to date: Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania (Partial)After spending Thursday night at the ATC Campground in Harper’s Ferry, I departure Friday morning . I stopped by the ATC Headquarters and talked to the staff. They wanted to know my thoughts of the campground as the town city council had concerns about what king of people the campground would attract and they were going to vote in August if it should remain open. After they heard my thoughts they asked if I would send a letter to the Council to recommend it remain opened. I did that and hopefully it will sway the council to keep the campground open. I was still burping from my snack of last night of Fritos and Cheese Dip. I ran out of chips before dip so I simply drank the remainder of the jar and now was paying for that decision.Hiked along the CNO Canal that follows the Potomac River into Washington D.C. This would be the first actual day under my new plan of not having any daily mileage plan. Instead I would hike from one shelter to the next then evaluate how my progress is going and how I feel. Based on time of day, weather and my physical condition I would go on only if all looked good. As the week progressed I was pleased on progress and happy that I was not stressing on miles as I hiked. This plan was working. Stopped for the night at Ed Garvey Shelter. The water was a steep half mile hike down a trail from the shelter. The shelter itself was pretty nice including a separate second floor with a separate set of stairs. This felt more like a cabin then a shelter. It was a very hot day so when I got to the water source I stripped down to my Birthday suit and took a cold shower. I quickly got into some clean clothes then got out a large gallon size zip lock bag that I used as a homemade washing machine. Everything that I was wearing I put into the bag with soap and water and literally shook the bag to agitate the clothes. I rinsed and repeated a couple of times until the water was clear of dirt. It actually corked quite well as the stink was gone and smelled nice. The evening was fun as three other southbound hikers stopped there as well. We played Spades until it was too dark to see the cards and called it a day.The next day I headed towards the Dahlgren Backpackers Campground. Along the way I crossed the Garthland State Park dedicated to the civil war. There were many displays and markers as this location was the site of a major battle of the civil war. We were not far from both Gettysburg and Antietam where more Americans were lost in a single day than ever before or after. Antietam alone was 30,000 deaths. Got to Dahlgren’s early afternoon and set up my tent. This place hot hot showers and indoor toilets. The campground was nice with an opening to the sky to watch the night stars. There were several black familes already set up with children playing in the fields and woods. Ended up talking with one of the dads. He said they have been doing this for 38 years going all the way back to when he and another dad were in scouts. The continued the tradition of coming to this campsite every 4th of July weekend with their families. I thought this was a pretty great thing and I knew the kids would remember this all of their lives as well. It turns out that a pizza place in the town about three miles from the campground would deliver so I coordinated with a couple of the other hikers and we ordered four pizzas, salads, fried green beans and more. Built a campfire for the evening and just sat around and yakked. From Dalgrens the plan was to head to Raven Rock via going through the George Washington Monument State Park. Stopped by to read and see all of the history of our first president. Within a few miles of the park I came to Interstate 40, a major N/S freeway serving the entire east coast. The trail followed a small foot bridge over the road. I could see that we were going to start hiking a narrow corridor of the AT Land that was surrounded by homes and businesses on both sides. While hiking you felt like you were in the wilderness but in the distance you could hear cars and people. Went past Annapolis Rock were a Park Service Trail Runner was posted at all times to ensure people understood the danger of the area with lots of cliffs around it. I crossed a road and decided to go into the town just two miles away for some lunch at Subway’s and ran back into Feather in town as well. He already coordinated a ride back to the trail from a local so I joined him in the ride back.Crossed the Mason Dixon line by the Penn Mar State Park Picnic area. A group of trail angels had just set up providing a homemade cake decorated as a U.S. Flag, lots of fruit and other snacks and fresh squeezed Apple Juice. The hike from Raven Rock was a terrible section of an old ancient riverbed full of boulders, some as big as an oven. I had to slow down to keep my balance and was pretty exhausted by the time I got to Penn Mar and the Trail Magic was just the way to end that section on a great note. We heard from locals that rain was forecast for late afternoon and all night but clearing up in the morning then a full week of sun and temps in the mid to upper 90s. Of course the real problem was the high humidity. The rain began around 5 pm until around midnight before it let up.I awoke and began what would be my best day ever. Today I would complete 1100 miles and pass the halfway point. The day was very hot but cloudy which helped with the sun but I was dripping wet with sweat all day long from the humidity. I only planned to go to the shelter right after the half way point but when I got there it was only 4pm and other than hot and thirsty feeling really good. So I decided to cook dinner then instead, take an hour break and let the temperature drop a little. I passed another shelter and still felt good and it was only 6 pm so I decided to head for a hostel at the Pine Furnace State Park. I reached the hostel at 8:30 after 13 and half hours of hiking that began at 7 am that morning. As I came up to the hostel at Ironmasters Mansion, now a hiker hostel in the state park I panicked when I realized the hostel is closed that day. I was exhausted, out of water and the sky darkening as night approached. I turned around to see a camping sign behind me for the park so I hiked to the campground and set up- for the night right next to the men’s bathroom that had hot showers, running water in the sinks and a real toilet.I awoke pretty refreshed considering the monster day I had yesterday and today was off to a great start. As I packed up a man approached and asked if I was an AT Hike which I said yes. Then he invited me to join him with his family for breakfast which I accepted. Spent a couple of hours eating and talking with them including his wife and three children. The girls were all cleaned up and a nice sun dress and hair braided and the son ready for a day in the woods. We covered a variety of topics. The children were homeschooled and this trip was part of their summer adventure plans. They would also be going to northern Minnesota to visit his mother close to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, and area I was very familiar with. Marilee’s family has a cabin close to the same area by Grand Marias MN, and we took Rachel and Gabe to a cabin resort in that area back around 2011. Breakfast was great and smelled awesome being cooked over a wood fire. I said goodbye and departed for the Hostel and a small grocery store next door. Ran into other hikers I knew and came to realize that I still was not urinating much this morning and needed to stop and drink until I was sure I was rehydrated. Today was forecast to 96 with a dew point of 72. In simple terms, that is nearing heat indexes well above 110 degrees. I knew that staying cool and hydrated was paramount. By 1 pm I was peeing clear and ready to go.The Dude and Feather showed up and I could tell they were completely drained from the heat as were other hikers passing through. As the temp was now about 95 degrees I took off for the next shelter. I went two miles and decided that after drinking most of my water in such sort time and that my sweat band was soaked this was not a good idea so I turned around and headed back to the store. Feather and Dude decided not to hike any further and were waiting for the hostel to open at 5pm. They laughed when they saw me return but agreed with my decision to come back here for the night and get an early start before it heated up. Dude got real quiet and laid down. He had eaten food and was queasy. We all agreed including him that he most likely is suffering from heat exhaustion and on the edge of heat stroke. That all confirmed my decision to return instead of hiking in such heat was the right decision. I went over to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Museum in the park. It had original gear and pictures from Benton and McKay, the original planners and builders of the trail as others like Ed Schaeffer, the first person to hike the entire trail nonstop. Not only was the museum full of history it provided a lot of information and notes about their past, upbringing and working together to get the trail built. This week and everything that happened would become that basis of what would happen tomorrow as I continued north.","Harpers Ferry
",Boiling Springs,"Jul 06, Wed",98
Mr Weather or Knots,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543938,"Thursday July 7th – Boiling Springs PA to the end to a journey of my lifetimeI told myself I would never make a major decision on a bad day. I was coming off an absolutely great week and feeling good. I spent the evening reflecting on my trip. The trip had many great events throughout and nearly most of my initial goals achieved. One of my major reasons for the trail was to have an adventure of a lifetime, explore the country I have never seen before, experience things and most important have fun. As I walked I asked myself what my expectations were going forward. At age 62, why I would invest three more months. I proved I am capable with nearly 1200 miles behind me but this was not supposed to be about just completing the hike at the cost of everything else.The Appalachian Trail passes through nearly all of America’s History from the Revolutionary War, Civil War and the Industrialization of America. It passes through two National Parks, Great Smoky Mountains and Shenandoah. It went through countless wilderness areas and national forest. It went by some of the most beautiful scenery in America and yet nearly the entire trail rarely provided access to those places. With few exceptions we bypassed mountain rivers or falls instead giving way to a pattern I am simply tired with, a green tunnel with little views on endless boulders that filled a destroyed trail. The trail by design was to follow the ridgeline of the Appalachians. Translation: A trail that very seldom allowed you to stretch out your legs hiking with stride, instead a hike requiring shorten and squatted steps constantly climbing or descending in a balancing act constantly looking down for your footing. A trail by design intending to conquer every single rise for no other purpose than to get to the top followed by a steep descent repeated over and over all day long. A trail incredibly damaged due to poor design and overuse steeply straight down. A trail 5 feet across and 2 feet deep like a small canyon filled now with rocks and washed out from rains that stripped the land away. Roots lined the trail, remnants of trees that once stood there now long gone and washed away.I cursed the builders wondering on why they would create such a difficult and damaged trail that bypassed nearly every natural beauty most hikers expect like rivers and streams, waterfalls, etc. After all, the trail is called the Appalachian NATIONAL SCENIC Trail. Just where are the sceneries. After three months I had to accept that nothing was going to change.The museum, recognized people like Ed Schaeffer who hiked to find solitude and cope with his experiences of WW2. Benton and MacKay wanted complete solitude and escape from others in a wilderness setting. They were about the challenge of the trail and as one ATC representative stated.I left that morning planning to go to the shelter 17 miles out but after only two hours I came to the accept this journey had become a job with little attractions few and far in between. Getting up each morning, hiking 10 plus hours, finding a location to stop, set up camp and cook dinner before falling to sleep. Like any job, the hike itself became the mission and really nothing else.So I turned east at the first opportunity and five miles later came to a state road. I put my hand out for a ride and got very lucky as a driver came by. He asked where I was going and I told him Harrisburg to find a Greyhound bus. By five pm I was at the airport with ticket in hand for a 7 am departure the next morning.While at the airport I used the men’s room to clean up. I took a small towel and completely washed down the best I could then into clean clothes, brushed my teeth etc with hopes of not offending anyone with stink. I smelt my pits and was satisfied that I was good to go……but…..when Marilee arrived at the Denver Airport her first words were: …..OMG you stink !!!……”. oh well for those poor passengers on the plane.When I got home we relaxed out on the patio and watched storms in the distant mountains. I reflected on the trip and my decision to end it. I slipped into complete peace with myself. I knew I had accomplished a great feat, completed a great adventure that I will never forget, came to understand myself better, accepted who and what I am, and most important, made a good decision. I am proud of my accomplishment. I asked myself if I had changed and was I a better person for this trip and the answer was a resounding yes.As for the trail I am now an Appalachian Section hiker with nearly 1200 miles behind me. If I come back and complete the remaining 900 miles then I would be recognized for hiking the entire AT. The question is will I? I will leave that decision until next year and for now enjoy Colorado Marilee and Riley as we watch the night skySome reflections.Longest hiking day: 30 milesLongest hiking week: 154Total Miles hiked: nearly 1200Best Trail Section Hiked: Rice Field to CaptainsBest Trail Hiking Buddy: Riley of courseBest Meal: 5 Guys in Gatlinburg TN with extra cheese, extra bacon, large sweet tea and large fries.Best Town: Wesser NC, home of the Nantahala River and the world white water championship courseBest Person: Daniel the American Indian from New HampshireBest Wildlife View: Those synchronous flashing fire flies in Shenandoah National ParkBest Night View: Cowboy camping in grass field along Blue Ridge Mountains ParkwayColdest night: 10 degrees Georgia mountainsHottest day: 97 with heat index of 102Scariest moment: Allens Gap Rock scrambles in rain/snow/ice pellets. 8 miles in 6.5 hoursBest Camp Fire: Uncle Johnny’s HostelBest Trail Angels: 1st Baptist Church at Fontana HiltonFunniest Moment: Commissioner returning to bunkhouse and putting ear plug into m ear so I cazn listen to his music while he played the air drums.Hardest Climb: Jacob’s Ladder","Boiling Springs
