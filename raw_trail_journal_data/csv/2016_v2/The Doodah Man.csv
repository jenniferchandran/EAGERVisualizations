The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520770,"Hello, family, friends, and friends-yet-to-be-made. This is the Doodah Man getting ready to return to the Appalachian Trail. I hiked 238 miles of the AT in 2011, but a hernia and a family issue rerouted me off the trail. My hernia has been repaired (let's hope that mesh holds!), and I am ready for a return to the AT.Some things will be different this time around for me. First and foremost, I will be hiking with a good friend and fellow hiker. I have hiked the Grand Canyon and over the Beartooth Mountains (northeast of Yellowstone National Park) with John, who lives in Billings, Montana. Years ago we talked about hiking the AT, and we had decided on 2014. I got antsy and jumped on the trail in 2011. 2014 slipped by on us, and we decided that 2016 would be a good year. Both of us will be seventy-years-old when we hit the trail in March. Our motto is ""Let's see how far we can get."" Right now I am in northern Indiana helping my two sisters to keep our Mom in her own home. She turned 103 last September. My two sisters live in Virginia, and I live in Idaho. Our schedule is usually one month on and two months off. I want to thank my two sisters for covering for me in my time on the AT. As I tell them, I could be gone two days, two weeks, two months, or longer. Nonetheless, I appreciate the sacrifice they are making in their lives so that I can pursue a dream. Marie and Kathy will be with me every step I take . . . as well as my Mom!John and I are aiming to get on the trail on Monday, March 14, 2016. We will be starting in Georgia and heading northward. The next two months will be spent getting my body into shape, getting my gear in order, and making preparations to be gone for an indefinite amount of time.I also need to thank my partner Doug for, once again, letting me head out onto the AT. He will bear the burden of keeping the home fires burning, the bills paid, and the daily chores of home-ownership in tiptop shape. He, too, will be walking with me, and I will feel his presence along the trail.This is all for now. I just wanted to get this journal going, and I will be making additional preparation entries in the weeks ahead!",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Tue",0
The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520771,"Today I am thinking of an image from Phil Ochs' song ""Changes."" We are all caught in ""the circle time parade of changes.""Yesterday I chatted with my hiking friend John whom I have been planning to trek with on the AT. John has had some knee issues over the years, and he has been working hard on getting his knees into shape for the AT. He saw his knee doctor last week, and he told John most definitely he should not go hiking on the AT. The ""downs"" on the AT would be the death knell to his one knee. So, not wanting to push his knees farther down the road to ""knee replacement,"" John has decided to not go on the AT. So, yesterday morning I was going to hike the AT with my good hiking buddy, and later that day I am solo. I am happy for John that he made the correct decision. After all, his knees have to last him a lifetime. I have chatted with folks who have hiked the AT, and they all said that the feet and knees take a beating. I know that for a fact from my 2011 experience on the AT. When I say that I am ""solo,"" I don't mean that I am ""so low."" My hiking plans will not change that radically, but I will be missing one of the major aspects of the AT that I was looking forward to: hiking the trail with a good friend . . . someone to share the experience with at the same moment that I am experiencing the trail. I know that John will be with me every step of my journey. His presence will be felt. So, I am wrapping my mind around the fact that I will be hitting the trail, once again, with no hiking buddy. Of course, I will meet good folks along the way, but not one will be someone with whom I have previously spent trail time. John's stepping back from the AT reminds me of one lesson that I learned from my 2011 AT experience: one has to be flexible and roll with the changes that the trail presents a hiker with. This is a pre-trail change that has been put before me. I now have a little over a month to image myself going solo. After all, change can be good . . . at least I think so!",,View Entry,"Jan 30, Sat",0
The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520772,"Many people have asked me why I am starting at Springer Mountain in Georgia again rather than picking up where I left the trail in 2011. In 2011 I hiked from Springer to Fontana Dam and then got off the trail due to a hernia and a family situtation. After three weeks off, I returned to the AT and picked up hiking in Damascus, Virginia. I reconnected with hiking friends who had remained on the trail and continued forward while I was off the trail. I then hiked to Atkins, Virginia, and got off the trail a second time. The hernia was really acting up. Thus, I have two places where I departed from the AT in 2011: Fontana Dam and Atkins, Virginia. Nothing is ever simple, is it?If I began my 2016 hike at Fontana Dam, I would be hitting the trail with some of the highest points on the entire trail in Smoky Mountain National Park right before me. I would prefer that the trail break me in a little before I tackle the Smokies. That is what the stretch from Springer to Fontana Dam would do.When my hiking buddy John was still planning to go with me, I could use him as an excuse to start at Springer. I would tell folks that John had never hiked this part of the AT, so it will be all new to him. Now that he is no longer accompanying me, I can't use him as an excuse!I have always been a person who believes that many things in life have a beginning, middle, and end . . . like a well-written paragraph or the seasons of the year from spring through winter. I like that formula. I don't know how long or how far I will go on this 2016 adventure, but it does have a beginning point and that is Springer Mountain in Georgia. Starting in Georgia is something with which I feel comfortable and right.I know what the AT is like from Springer to Fontana Dam. I know how to get going and what will be expected from me in the initial weeks. I don't think the trail will have changed that much in five years. By the time I get to Fontana Dam, part of me will feel trail-seasoned. I should be ready for the Smokies by then.Finally, this is my hike, something that I am doing myself. If I start at Springer, what difference does it make to anyone besides me? I know that this sounds a bit selfish and self-centered, but it is a choice I am making. Egads! I don't like how this sounds. Let me try another way. I have always felt that some things in life have a certain way of being done . . . whether it be folding a t-shirt, arranging clothes on hangers in a closet, or refolding towels on a rack in the bathroom. It is not that there is a right way or a wrong way, but it is a way that works for me. Possibly blame my Catholic grade-school education where we always put ""JMJ"" at the top of any paper we used for homework or a test! In a Catholic grade school, one learns about a right way and a wrong way, and this has always appealed to my anal-slanted approach to life! Anyway, starting at Springer works for me. Springer is the southern terminus of the AT, and as a north-bound hiker this is where I feel I should start.Whew! I am so glad that I got this out of the way!",,View Entry,"Feb 05, Fri",0
The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520853,"For hikers going through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, a permit is required. This information comes from an article in the April 2013 issue of A.T. Journals: ""As of February 13, 2013, a backcountry permit must be obtained before entering the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. . . .""I won't go into the details of the permit, but permits are available at www.smokiespermits.nps.gov. One can get additional information by calling 865-436-1297. I called the other day for a clearer explanation of the permit, and the person to whom I spoke was friendly, patient, and helpful. Many hikers might want to get the permit before beginning their hikes. Also, if a hiker has a Senior Pass (the lifetime national parks and federal recreational lands pass for a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, 62 years or older), he or she must still get the permit.",,View Entry,"Feb 08, Mon",0
The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521041,"Tomorrow (Saturday, February 13) in Coeur d'Alene there will be the 2nd Annual Inland NW Winter Ruck, an event for anyone planning a long-distance hike. It will be an interesting get-together . . . always is when a group of long-distance hikers assemble to talk about experiences and gear.I am making several changes gear-wise this time around . . . different from my previous AT adventure. In 2011 my backpack was a Kelty Tioga external frame backpack. Its capacity was 5,500 cubic inches. This time I am gong with an Osprey Atmos AG. The AG stands for ""anti-gravity."" Whenever I think of ""AG,"" helium balloons attached to the backpack come to mind! I think I like the concept of anti-gravity when applied to backpacks. Anything that makes the load more comfortable on the back is a ""thumbs up"" for me. My new backpack is approximately 4,000 cubic inches in capacity which means that I am dropping down 1,500 cubic inches in space from my 2011 backpack. Not only am I dropping down in space/size, but I am also dropping down in the weight of the ""stuff"" I would put in that space. Now, here comes the challenge: how do I put what I need on the trail into 4,000 cubic inches? Choices will have to be made.I have begun to use the bed in the spare bedroom for laying out ""stuff."" Whenever I think of something, I just throw it on the bed. In the weeks ahead I will make decisions . . . take this, don't take that, or make a decision on that at a later date. I am fortunate that I have two sisters and their husbands who live in Virginia and are willing to let me leave a bin of ""stuff"" at each of their homes. If I need something, I can always contact them, and they can send it to me as soon as possible. For example, I take thirteen vitamins a day. I know that some folks believe that taking all those vitamins aren't worth ""diddly-squat."" I try to ignore ""some folks"" most of the time. Nonetheless, I don't intend to carry more than a three-weeks' supply with me at any one time. I am putting my daily dose in small packets and will count on my sisters to send me a supply whenever I need them. Most of my gear is the same that I used in 2011: my rectagular sleeping bag (a mummy-style bag simply doesn't work for me); my Jet Boil; my Hubba Hubba two-person tent (I like the extra space so that I can have my backpack inside the tent with me); my Katadyn water purifier (great support from the company when I broke a valve on the AT in 2011 . . . sent me a replacement right away); and my REI sleeping pad. Oh, another thing that is new are my iPhone 6 with a Word app and my wifi camera. I hope to update my journal entries while hiking the trail . . . rather than waiting until I got to a trail town to make all of my entries. Now, I have to learn the technology. I sure wish I had a junior-high-school kid to hike along with me! It is amazing how technology-savvy they can be!Well, time to end this entry. I am heading out for a six-mile jaunt around town. After tomorrow's ruck, I am going to begin my relationship with my new backpack . . . will start wearing it on my daily walks.Oh, happy Valentine's Day to everyone! Celebrate Sunday by going to see the movie ""Brooklyn."" It is such a sweet film.",,View Entry,"Feb 12, Fri",0
The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521282,"Last Saturday I attended an ALDHA-West day-long hiking conference in Coeur d'Alene. It is always good when a bunch of long-distance hikers get together to talk about trails, footwear, gear, food, and their experiences while moving forward through space.One tip that was echoed again and again was to see a thru-hike as a series of shorter hikes. This is what my friend John and I did when we were planning our 2016 hike on the AT. We planned to set short-term goals for ourselves. For example, I set the first short-term goal as the Georgia/North Carolina state line, approximately 72 miles down the trail from Springer. John set the second short-term goal at Fontana Dam at the entrance to the Great Smokies National Park. This is as far as we got in our planning.In 2011 when I hopped on the AT in Georgia, I had first and foremost Maine as my goal. I soon realized how overwhelming that concept was. I didn't acknowledge that getting to Maine would be accomplished by a series of shorter hikes.In 2013 when I hiked the French route of the Camino de Santiago in Spain with my sister, we wisely did not think in terms of the entire 500 miles of the route . . . rather we broke the pilgrimage down to ten-to-fourteen-mile days. After a while, the days and miles added up, and we eventually found ourselves in Santiago de Compostela. When we took a backward glance, we were amazed at our accomplishment.I must be honest and admit that somewhere in the dim recesses of my mind looms Katahdin, the northern terminus of the AT. I will purposely keep it there. If I am asked by someone along the way how far I am going, I will give that person my short term goal . . . the next state line or the next trail town. If, perchance, I end up at Katahdin, then it will be because I did a continuous series of short hikes. I know that this might sound silly to some readers, but there is a good reason for thinking this way. Most folks who set foot on the AT will not complete a thru-hike, even though a thru-hike is their goal. In 2011 I left the AT after 238 miles because of a hernia. Part of me felt like a failure. I didn't make it to Katahdin, and this initially shaped the way that I thought about my AT experience. I totally downplayed the fact that I had hiked 238 miles of the trail.Hopefully I am a bit wiser this time around. After all, I am five years older! So, I am returning to the AT and starting at Springer with the state line of Georgia/North Carolina as my initial goal. Once I get there, I will think about what I have accomplished and then set my second goal. And who knows? I won't say the ""K"" word, but I just might get there one day after all of these short hikes!",,Breaking Down a Thru-Hike,"Feb 17, Wed",0
The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521430,"With the Grateful Dead in concert at Lincoln, Nebraska, from early 1973 (I attended that concert and still have the ticket stub!) playing in the background, I just spent the morning and thensome working on my vitamins for the AT. I have been taking thirteen vitamins a day for over twenty-five years, and I will continue to take them on the AT.So, with the help of cupcake tins, I assembled 210 daily packets of thirteen vitamins. I then put a three-week supply of packets in Ziploc baggies, ending up with ten Ziploc baggies of vitamins. Each three-week supply weighs eleven ounces. I won't carry more than a three-week supply at any one time. I have two sisters who live in Virginia, and when I need a resupply, I will give them a call and have them send the vitamins to me. So, that part of preparing for the AT is done. Check that off my list!Part of the AT adventure is getting ready to be gone, not only with one's physical preparation and gear, but with those things that will happen back home in one's absence. Every backpacker handles this aspect of long-distance hiking differently. For me, I have to take that forward glance, trying to anticipate what birthdays and holidays I will miss, what bills will be due, what bills are on auto-pay, what magazine and newspaper subscriptions will expire while I am gone, what memberships (like at Costco) become due, and so on. At times it can be overwhelming!But it is also fun! Once I set foot on the AT on March 14, there is little I can do about what I have forgotten to address. My focus will be on placing one foot ahead of the other! Thank goodness I have an understanding partner. The burden of long-distance hiking falls not only on the person doing the hiking, but also on the ones back home. Life continues on back home when one is on the AT. This becomes more challenging when one lives across the country and a far distance from the AT. Hopping on and off the trail becomes less of an option unless, of course, there is an emergency . . . and having family and friends visit while hiking the trail takes extra planning.So much to think about in the ""getting ready to be gone"" stage of hiking the AT!",,Getting Ready to Be Gone!,"Feb 19, Fri",0
The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521949,"One of the changes from my 2011 Appalachian Trail adventure is my updated iPhone 6. I will be using my iPhone to keep my Trail Journals entries current as well as to keep in touch with my partner Doug, family, and friends. A concern of mine has been the life of the iPhone's battery. I will keep my iPhone on airplane mode and will turn off Wifi roaming while hiking. Airplane mode does not prevent me from taking photos along the way. This should help to extend the life of the battery charge.John, my Billings' friend, suggested the following article containing tips to extend the life of the battery charge: http://www.payetteforward.com/why-does-my-iphone-battery-die-so-fast-heres-the-real-fix/You might find the article useful.

The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522164,"Well, one week from today I will begin driving eastward, and two weeks from today I will begin my AT hike. My partner Doug is off skiing in Taos, New Mexico, this week, so I have the house to myself. I have spread out all of my backpacking ""stuff"" and am now making decisions about what to take, what to leave in bins at the houses of my two sisters in Virginia, and what to leave behind. Needless to say, space will dictate much. I am dropping down 1,500 cubic inches in backpack size from when I hiked the AT in 2011. So, I won't have as much space to fill, but also I won't be carrying as much weight. Last night I carefully cut up David ""Awol"" Miller's ""2016 Northbound: The A.T. Guide"" into five sections. I figured that there was no need to be carrying the Maine part of the guide, for example, while I was in Georgia! I am beginning with the Georgia/North Carolina/Tennessee section of the book, and my sisters will send me the other sections as needed.Speaking of books, a good friend in Troy, New York, sent me a book that he said was ""calling to me."" He works in a bookstore in Troy, and he sent me Thich Nhat Hanh's ""How to Walk,"" a small book published by Parallax Press in Berkeley. I have only briefly glanced through it, and one small chapter titled ""I Walk for You"" caught my eye. One thought in the chapter states, ""When I breathe in, I say to myself, 'It's wonderful that I am still able to walk like this.'"" I am seventy-years-old, and I am most thankful that I can walk distances without much pain. I am sure that my knees will be talking to me along the trail and reminding me to be more mindful of them. But there are many folks, some much younger than I, who for one reason or another are not able to walk, let alone do the kind of walking that the AT demands. In the days ahead, I will be spending more time with this small book. Thank you, Stanley!I am often asked if I get lonely on the trail. Of course I do. I miss my partner, my family, and my friends. But the AT gives as well. I am still in contact with fellow hikers whom I met on the AT in 2011. One of them, whose trail name is No Problem, will be meeting me at Springer and will accompany me while I am getting my trail legs. He is heading off to Spain in May to walk the Northern Route of the Camino and says that hiking with me will get his legs in shape as well. Another friend, whose trail name is Bumblebee, is in law school in Maine. She wrote me that she will be starting a SOBO hike on the AT in early August. She said that she is looking forward to crossing paths with me along the way. The thought of this happening makes me very happy.I don't mind hiking by myself, especially since I don't have to worry about grizzly bears like I do when hiking in Idaho and Montana. One of my joys while hiking is, when the mood hits, to select a family member or friend to accompany me for the day or a part of the day. I might select Aunt Betty or Uncle Tom or St. Matt's Class of 1959 to keep me company. Without anyone there to correct my memory, I find myself reliving past memories and possibly even restructuring them. This is just one way that I pass a day on the trail when not being overwhelmed by the natural world around me.Enough with this entry . . . I need to get back to the task at hand . . . getting my gear ready for the AT. Let the fun continue!",,Getting Close to Departing,"Mar 01, Tue",0
The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522579,"This will be my last pre-hike entry before hitting the Appalachian Trail on March 14. I did an easy six-mile loop around town today with my loaded Osprey Atmos AG. My base weight, according to the scale at the Sandpoint West Health Club, is 27 pounds. Throw in food and water and I should be carrying around 35 pounds on my back. This is a little heavier than I had planned, but I can live with it. But can my knees?The backpack felt very comfortable with my hips carrying most of the weight. I am carrying my tent outside my backpack along with my Crocs, my camp footwear. Otherwise, everything else goes inside the backpack. I have decided to go without my Platypus hydration system . . . at least for the initial part of the hike. I am all set to begin on this adventure. Now it is a matter of going cross-country to get to Springer Mountain in Georgia. That is what I will be doing next week. I sort feel like Calvin and Hobbes in their final cartoon where it's winter, the world is all white, and they are tobogganing down a hill.

The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524130,"Happy Ides of March! What better day to begin my AT adventure! Merle (""No Problem"") and I drove from Asheville, North Carolina, to Springer Mountain early in the morning. We took Forest Service Road 42 to .9 miles from Springer Mountain. Our plan was this: Merle would hike with me for two days and get me started. He would then return to his car and drive back to Asheville. Merle is planning on doing the Camino de Santiago Northern Route in May, and he said he wanted to get into shape. We left our backpacks in the car at the parking space on FSR 42 and hiked .9 miles to the southern terminus of the AT. It was a short and easy hike. The day was gloriously beautiful . . . sunny and hot. We took photos, returned to the car, got our backpacks, and off we went. It was around noon when we hit the trail.I had thought that the trail would be crowded with hikers, especially with the popularity of the recent film ""A Walk in the Woods."" It didn't seem any more crowded or busy than when I hiked this section in 2011. When we got to Hawk Mountain Shelter, I was surprised to see so many tents and even four large dogs. With the dogs in the campsite, I am sure that there was no room for bears! The day's hiking had a couple of rough uphills, but nothing like what lies ahead of us. It felt good to be back on the AT again. I was pleased with the way my new Osprey Atmos AG felt on my back. I am not wild about my new REI one-person, half-dome tent. I put a rip in the tent's stuff sack just by rubbing against a tree. Also, I couldn't get the floor of the tent to lay flat without ripples. I left my two person Hubba Hubba tent in Asheville. I just might ask for it in the future.","Springer Mountain

The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524131,"When I hiked the AT in 2011, I hiked all the way to Gooch Mountain Shelter in one day. Well, how did I do that? I have no idea. Possibly I am a bit wiser five years later, but breaking the distance into two days was a smart idea. Day 2 was a day of long ups and downs. Merle (""No Problem"") should have a new trail nickname: The Uphill Cookie Monster. He eats those uphills without breaking stride. I so admire his hiking style. When I head uphill, I take breaks, stopping to regain my breath, wipe the sweat from my forehead, and pick my next uphill place to stop!Curiously, I heard no birds while hiking today, but I had some fantastic views of the surrounding mountains. Most of the trees are not leafed out, so vistas are plentiful. In about three weeks, such vistas will not be possible. This is one of the advantages of starting at this time of year.Gooch Mountain Shelter was not crowded when we arrived, but it did fill up. Merle decided to take a short afternoon nap and then hike back a couple of miles. This would give him a head start to his car the next day. So, after I set up my tent, I said good-bye to Merle and watched him head back towards his car. We made plans to see each other in about a week when he would hike a couple of days with me again.I met many interesting hikers at Gooch Mountain Shelter: Tobasco from Oklahoma (within five minutes he told me about an excellent place called Goldies in Tulsa to eat . . . food is always a hot topic of conversation among hikers!); Harmonica John from Bloomington, Indiana, and a fellow Notre Dame graduate; Lobo from the most southern state in Mexico; and Victory with her Star Wars Crocs. Victory and I also had the same REI half-dome tent, Salomon boots, and Injinji toe socks.

The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524132,"Today's destination was interesting. I would have preferred to hike to Wood's Hole Shelter, but there is a hard-shell ""bear cannister"" zone between Jarrard Gap and Neel's Gap on the trail. One must have a bear cannister between March 1 and June 1 in order to overnight in this area of around six miles. Well, I only saw one hiker with a bear cannister. If bears are a problem in this corridor, why not install bear cables like the ones at Hawk Mountain and Gooch Mountain? Anyway, complaining gets one nowhere. The result is that everyone bunches up at Lance Creek and then makes the hike into Neel's Gap the next day. Of course, some hikers headed onto Neel's Gap in one long hike.At Woody Gap there was my first trail magic. Tick Tock had covered up a picnic table with bananas, oranges, tangerines, bags of chips and Cheetos, bottles of water, and other goodies. He was getting a grill going for hot dogs and hamburgers. Tick Tock is from Locust Grove, Virginia, and he had hiked most of the AT. What a wonderful person! I had a banana, a bag of Cheetos, and a bottle of water. Then I thanked him and moved on.A suggestion to hikers: whenever possible, get the name and address of the Trail Angel. I told Tick Tock that whenever I get back to Sandpoint, I will send him a ""thank you"" note for this generosity. There are so many kind people both on and off the trail. Thanking them is one way to keep the magic happening!My discontent with my tent (hey, that rhymes!) continues. I am going to ask Merle to bring my Hubba Hubba to me when we meet up again. It will add a pound to my pack weight, but it will be well worth it.I met Marshmallow today. He is from Miami, and the weight of his backpack is over 45 pounds. He will do a shakedown of his backpack at Neel's Gap. His body frame is much smaller than mine, and he needs to trim down that backpack weight. That is one of the services that folks at Neel's Gap provide: a shakedown of your backpack . . . what is necessary and what can be sent home. They did that for me in 2011, and I was thankful.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524133,"Today's hike took me up and down the highest point on the AT in Georgia: Blood Mountain. The hike up was not so bad because it is very gradual. The hike down was brutal . . . scrambling over rocks and boulders. It was a rough time on my knees, but thank goodness for trekking poles!One of the interesting sites at Neel's Gap is the tree of hiking boots. I have read somewhere that 20% of all AT adventures end at Neel's Gap. I suppose that frustrate hikers throw their boots up into the tree in disgust. I took a photo, but I haven't learned yet how to download a photo from iPhone to my e-mail to this site. Anyway, it is a hoot to see so many boots dangling on the branches . . . and there are more boots hanging on a clothesline within the store.I decided to spend the night at Blood Mountain Cabins, just .3 mile from the outfitter at Neel's Gap. For $99 I got an entire cabin that could sleep four adults and two children. I didn't realize this at the time I made my reservation. The hosts were wonderful. A load of laundry came with the price, and I got to get rid of my smelly clothes. Also, wifi was available in the office area.Jersey Girl, a hiker whom I met on the trail, made a reservation at Blood Mountain Cabins but for next Friday. He didn't realize that he had listed the wrong date. The cabins were full, so I invited him to join me. He brought along Tricks and Pigeon, and we shared the cabin. By the way, Jersey Girl is a ""he."" I don't know how he got the trail name!The weather forecast for the next two days was for rain and cold. I decided I wanted to give my body, especially my feet, a rest. I have a Sandpoint friend who winters in Ellijay, Georgia, on her family's property. So, I called Gail, and she said it would be great to have me visit for a couple of days. We are good friends in Sandpoint, and it would be a shame not to see each other since I was in the area.

They needed to get back to school and to jobs. So, they drove me to Blairsville, and we had breakfast at Cabin Mountain Coffee. I said goodbye to them. It was fun to hang out with them. It has been a gazillion years since I had spent time with adults in their early twenties. I so enjoyed their talk and thoughts about life . . . so refreshing!It was great to see Gail again. It was about an hour-and-half drive for her, and we chatted all the way to her family's home. Gail already had a friend from South Carolina with her. She hadn't seen Robin in twenty years, and they were catching up on each other's lives. Then two friends from Atlanta were driving up for the day. So, we was a fun gathering with so many of Gail's friends around the dinner table.It feels good not to be hiking today. I am giving my feet a break. I have two toes that are crying out for attention, and I hear them. They will be ready to go on Monday.","Neel's Gap

The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524135,"Not much to report today. Robin left early this morning to return home to South Carolina. Gail and I will go for a walk in the afternoon. The rain seems to have moved on, but the cold did move in.The plan is that Gail will drive me back to Neel's Gap early tomorrow morning, and I will return to hiking the AT. The two-day break has been good for my body and spirit. There is no need to kill myself with mega-miles at this point in my adventure. I am taking it easy in these initial days. It is so good to reconnect with Gail. We have many things in common besides Sandpoint. We both volunteer at our community-supported radio station in Sandpoint: 88.5 KRFY (www.krfy.org). She has her ""Hump Day Cafe"" on Wednesday evenings, and I have a three-hour folk much program on Thursday nights. Of course, we talk and listen to music whenever we get together.Friends are what it is all about!","Ellijay, Georgia

The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524742,"Wow! What a way to begin my hiking day! Gail drove me to Neel's Gap. It had lightly snowed overnight at higher elevations. When Gail left me a Neel's Gap at around 8:00, the thermometer in her car was at 27 degrees. The cold wasn't so bad, but the wind was howling. I would guess that the wind chill must have been in the single digits. Leonardo in ""The Revenant"" had nothing on me! Thank goodness that I had packed my Marmot gloves and a balaclava. Once I got hiking, the ups and downs kept me warm. This weather lasted all morning, and then as the sun got high in the sky, the ice from the trees began pelting me with missiles of ice! I have to admit that I loved the morning. The cold and wind took my mind off the ups and downs. And I wore my Patagonia down jacket the entire hiking day, a first for me.I hiked into Low Gap and got a spot in the shelter. It was supposed to be even colder than the previous night, and I didn't feel like putting up a tent and getting snowed upon.In the shelter I met Mike (no trail name yet) and Cold Turkey. Since I took two zero days, I am hiking with a new group of folks in my hiking bubble.","Neel's Gap

The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524743,"I did something last night that I hadn't ever done before in my sleeping bag: I was in the bag for 12 1/2 hours! As the sun dropped over the hill, the chill really set in. I had an early supper at around 5:00 p.m. I put my ""stuff"" in order, brushed my teeth, and hopped into the bag at 6:30 p.m., right around the time that Notre Dame women were tipping off against Indiana in the NCAA tourney. Go Lady Irish! The night was very, very cold. It was a clear sky with an almost full moon, but the wind had died down. I didn't get out of my sleeping bag until 7:00 in the morning. I slept my usual backpacking sleep . . . three to four hours of sound sleep and then tossing and turning until the morning with a bit of sleep here and there. The first four miles out of Low Gap were heaven . . . a very smooth trail with no rocks, roots, or branches . . . and with minimal ups and downs. I wish the entire AT could be like this! As I worked my way toward Blue Mountain, I met up with Merle (""No Problem"") coming from the opposite direction. He had driven from Asheville, NC, to Unicoi Gap and then hiked in towards me from there. It was so good to see him again. His plan was to spend the night at Blue Mountain and then hike back to his car the next day. We would trade out my new REI Quarter Dome tent for my old faithful Hubba Hubba.At Blue Mountain I met up with XCuse, a fellow hiker whom I had met online before I left Sandpoint. XCuse and I were doing pre-hike entries on this site, and we began exchanging e-mails. It is so great to hook up and hike with him. He is from Syracuse, New York, and sleeps in a hammock. I have taken a photo of his sleeping accommodation, but I still don't know how to post photos on my journal entries.","Low Gap

The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524745,"It was another chilly night, and I moved somewhat slowly putting my gear together. It takes me between one hour and a quarter and a hour and a half to get ready to hit the trail in the morning. I usually slam down a bottle of water with a hydration tablet in the morning and then have ""breakfast"" mid-morning . . . usually a breakfast bar. But this morning was sheer bliss. A group of women called the Women's Hiking Group from Cornelia had set up the most plentiful display of trail magic I have ever seen . . . from homemade vegetable soup (yummy!) to breakfast burritos, from toilet paper to tubes of toothpaste and everything in between. To see their smiling and happy faces was wonderful . . . another example of the kind folks from the community who support hikers. I said goodbye to Merle and my REI Quarter Dome tent and continued up and down the trail. There were a couple of ups over 4,000 feet. It is not the elevation that is so bad at times . . . it is the distance that one has to walk to get to that elevation that is important!At Tray Gap there was more trail magic. A sign was on the trail . . . no more hot dogs, but bananas, pop, and water. Two fellows were sitting in camp chairs and were at the end of their ""trail magic"" day. They were both from around this area, and it was awfully kind of them to be there for us hikers.","Blue Mountain

The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524747,"It was so wonderful to be in my Hubba Hubba tent again. Though I have added a pound and a half to my backpack's base weight, I think it is worth it. The tent is for two people, and I am able to bring in my backpack at night. I love the extra room and am willing to carry the extra weight. Today's hike had two major ups and downs, and they do beat me up. But I am amazed at how quickly my body recovers. I am tackling my ups like I am tackling the AT: in sections! When I have an uphill before me, I choose a spot ahead . . . a tree or a rock . . . and then I hike to it. I stop, catch my breath, and then select another landmark. So, I now approach uphills as a series of short uphills! It works for me, and that's what is important!I left XCuse and Mike (another hiking friend with no trail name) at Deep Gap. They were going to spend the night there and then hike to Dick's Gap tomorrow. They will be staying at Top of Georgia Hostel tomorrow night. I continued on to Dick's Gap . . . one of the longest descents I have experienced! I was hitchhiking into Hiawassee (eleven miles distance) and was picked up by Miss Janet. She shuttles folks back and forth between the trail and the town.I had a reservation at the Holiday Inn Express, a place where I stayed in 2011. I am taking a zero day tomorrow. After hiking eleven miles, I didn't feel that I had enough time to do laundry (I really smell after three or four days on the trail!), resupply, and get a good night's rest before hitting the trail the next day. A zero day in Hiawassee will give me a chance to get all of these things done in a less rushed manner. So, I will be back on the trail on Holy Saturday, hoping to meet up with XCuse and Mike. I can't believe that it is almost Easter!I went to dinner tonight at Daniel's AYCE (all you can eat). I remembered the restaurant from five years ago, and it has some excellent fried chicken. I had dinner with Westy and his wife Kathy. She meets him from major highway to major highway along the trail in their Westphalia van. Westy hikes the AT while his wife reads and enjoys the wonders of northern Georgia. It is a neat set-up since he gets to sleep in his van every three or four days.","Tray Mountain

The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524786,"Today I will be spending time shopping and getting my gear ready to be on the trail tomorrow. I am staying at the Holiday Inn Express in Hiawassee, and I highly recommend the place. The free breakfast is absolutely outstanding.I am making trail journal entries only when I have access to a computer. There might be days and possibly even weeks between my times on the computer. Initially, I had planned to do journal entries on my iPhone. I have discovered that when I get to a place for the night on the trail, I am much too busy setting up my tent, getting supper ready, and putting my backpack in order. I simply don't have the time or energy to make a journal entry. Also, I want to preserve my phone's charge as long as possible. So, have no fear if you don't hear from me in a while. I am here, but not around a computer to make entries!I want to wish everyone a Happy Easter since I won't be near a computer this coming Sunday. On the trail, life narrows itself down to the miles in the day ahead . . . and the day after that. News from the outer world filters through slowly. This is one of the joys being on the trail. A hiker even has to think twice about what day it is.","Hiawassee

The Doodah Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526719,"Well, I am back in Sandpoint after having hiked nearly two weeks on the AT. I wasn't getting good sleep, and it would have been a matter of time before it caught up on me.I thoroughly enjoyed my time on the trail. My body held up wonderfully. I had no problems with my knees or feet. I loved my Osprey Atmos AG backpack, even though I had to cinch up the waist time and time again. The backpack felt so good on my back, and it held everything that I needed on the trail.I highly recommend the Salomon lightweight hiking boots. Along with the Injinji liners, my feet did well with Georgia's ups and downs.I met some wonderful people on the trail . . . XCuse, Mike, Jim, John, Victory, Tabasco, Jersey Girl, Trix, Pigeon, Olivia, Todd, and others. I wish I would have continued northwards, but it was not meant to be.I want to thank 3D, a thru-hiker from 2015. His support and encouragement were greatly appreciated. I suggest that future hikers read his journal on this site. 3D has some helpful tips as well as some solid insights on what it takes to be a thru-hiker. I also want to thank Merle . . . ""No Problem"" . . . for hiking with me and getting me going on this journey. He was planning to support me all the way to Maine. His enthusiasm and energy were invaluable. He continues to be a hiking inspiration.I finally want to thank Doug, my family, and my friends for being behind me 100%. I never would have gone onto the trail without their love and support.So, this dream is over, but there are other trails to hike. I will take the rest of this spring and summer off from dreaming, but who knows where my hiking boots will take me next? Thanks for reading my journal and making me very happy!Keep on truckin', everyone!",,End of This Trail!,"Apr 06, Wed",0
