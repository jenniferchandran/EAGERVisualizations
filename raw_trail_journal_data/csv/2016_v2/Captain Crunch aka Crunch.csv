Captain Crunch aka Crunch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519623,"Reactions to this plan to hike the A.T. vary from enthusiastic support to complete bafflement. Why? Why would I want to do such a thing? To anyone who has been affected by a wanderlust or simply a desire to do something epic, this is a very difficult question to answer. I find it hard to understand myself why, about 15 years ago, when I discovered this thing called thru-hiking, it completely took hold in my imagination. I desperately wanted to walk out of winter and into spring, watching the greening of the woods one plant at a time...and then to walk through summer and back into the edge of Autumn in Maine. I wanted to see what it would be like to distill my worries down to the most basic of needs: food, shelter, water and how far I would walk on any given day. No TV, no e-mail, no bosses.  At age 59, I am beginning to see the gradual deterioration of my body - especially in the joints. If I do not make this attempt now, I fear the chance will pass and one day I would show my granddaughter a book about the A.T. and tell her that this is something extraordinary that I wanted to do, but didn't ever try. NOT GOOD! Even if I don't make it to Katahdin, I want to at least be able to say I gave it my best shot.  So what is the answer to the question Why? My answer is to follow along. Hike with me vicariously thru my journals. Look at my pictures. Read about the pain, discomfort, bugs and hunger. Also read about the beauty, the really cool people and the feeling of accomplishment after conquering each summit. At the end, each person who asks why should have an answer...or not. I suppose it really isn't important to voice my reasons. Only one person needs to understand (other than me) and that is my wife. And she DOES get it! That is enough for me.  Happy Hiking!","

The snow made it tough going - good for a workout. I carried my full winter load with food and water (33 pounds). I would still like to shave a pound or two off of that somehow. It's getting down to leaving behind comfort or contingency items. I suppose I could always ship stuff home if I find I don't use at all on the trail.,"Home

Just a matter of loading up a full pack and hitting the hills at a hard pace - my pace on the thru hike will be much slower.

Captain Crunch aka Crunch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521162,"We just had my ""Kick-Off"" party here at home. Renee made a beautiful cake and my daughter added the AT logo very nicely.  There is a saying for hikers: ""Hike your own hike"". This is so very appropriate. We each hit the trail with our own idea of what a thru-hike must be. An additional aspect of that phrase is a basic philosophy of how to treat others. Hike your own hike, but do not judge others on how they desire to hike their hike. My plan is simple. I want to start at the arch at Amicalola Falls State Park in Georgia and hike the 8 mile approach trail to Springer Mountain. Then, I want to pass every white blaze all the way to Mount Katahdin, while carrying my pack every step of the way. I will not take short cuts or skip sections. Note: This is my plan, but I realize that plans change. Perhaps I will be tempted at some point, when my knees ache and my drive is low, and an opportunity presents itself for me to maybe slack pack a section, that I will give in and lower my standard just a little. Who knows? I might not end up the purist I started out to be. However, a purist I intend to be at least at the start. This will not make me better than anyone else, nor will it make my hike more significant. It is simply what I desire to do. So...Hike Your Own Hike, and ENJOY!","Home

Captain Crunch aka Crunch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521606,"The official distance of the trail this year is 2,189.1 miles. That sounds like a long way. Heck, it IS a long way. I guess the trick is to not focus on the total undertaking, but to think about each step, one at a time. It is now just two weeks until departure. A good description of how I feel right now is found in a quote from the movie Shawshank Redemption:""I find I'm so excited, I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain.""Exactly!","Home

Everything from two brothers ""Fili and Kili"" named after dwarves from a Tolkein novel who frequently spoke in Elvish or Dwarvish, to an interesting guy named ""Bear Claw"" who was carrying an actual sword (he is a member of the Society for Creative Anachronism). I met a Portuguese fellow who ended each night loudly declaring in a heavy accent: ""It is not easy!""- I saw some beautiful sights and views that only a hiker gets to see.- I walked over 200 miles continuously, a new first for me physically.- Walking such a distance has taught me many valuable lessons to help refine my gear and backpacking technique. - The Appalachian Trail is not going anywhere. I will still be section hiking and enjoying its beauty.WHY:- From the first day, I have been concerned with the effect of this endeavor on Renee and my family, both emotionally and financially.- I have lost 22 pounds in three weeks. This is not sustainable or healthy. To prevent such weight loss, I must carry more food, which means more weight in my pack. This only makes the hiking more difficult, burning more calories. Quite a conundrum. All hikers lose weight, but my body seems to lose at a greater rate than normal.- I was surprised and dismayed at how much I missed Renee, the kids, my granddaughter, my guitar, and my art. - I underestimated the level of arthritis in my knees and toes (hallux rigidus) and its effect on long distance hiking. I will still be hiking and backpacking, but with Renee, my children, or my friends. We will share both the hardships and the sights of the trail together (but in short segments). I will still, in pieces, attempt to hike the entire Appalachian Trail. This is not a failure, but merely a change of plans to achieve a goal.

The rhododendron have started to bloom adding a splash of color to a gray day. I had an epic butt splat in the mud, covering my backside and pack with gooey mud. I think I said a bad word. A few miles on it came to a stream, where I was able to clean up some. Wet is better than mud.","Atkins, VA

Not long ago a young hiker named J-Bird completed his thru hike. Shortly after he returned home he was diagnosed with cancer and passed away. His family (Dave and Deanna Werner), along with friends have travelled from Pennsylvania to help hikers to honor J-Birds memory. They provided food, warm drinks, and warm smiles. I know J-Bird was smiling too. Magic indeed.","Jenkins Shelter

I have passed under this bridge a thousand times, so it was interesting to walk over it. The rhododendrons are starting to bloom, splashing the woods with bright color. The trail had a lot of long flat sections, so I was able to trudge on and on to accumulate a new personal best on distance.","Bland, VA

However, the springs are all running nicely, so filling up on water is easy. The trail passed through the outskirts of Pearisburg with a short road walk across a bridge. It is always a strange feeling to come out of the woods and walk alongside high speed traffic. Rice Field shelter was a nice place to end the day with good views looking down the valley to the town I passed earlier. I met up with a couple of hikers I haven't seen in a while (One Step and Two Step) and also met the Professor who provided some funny stories wile we cooked and ate supper.","Woods Hole Hostel

The morning clouds cleared off to give a rain-free day to cover some rocky and hilly ground to get to Route 42. From there I hitched a ride into Blacksburg, where my son Lucas picked me up to head home for the Trail Days Festival in Damascus. I expect there to be a record crowd of hikers there this year.","Rice Field Shelter

Captain Crunch aka Crunch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533457,"On Saturday, I had the opportunity and joy to participate in the Trail Days festival as a thru-hiker. It was very cool to walk in the parade with the other 2016 hikers. The traditional water battle with the crowd (and especially my family) was outrageous fun. Since, I am home during this time, I have done some gear repair and changed to summer clothing and sleeping bag. My pack is a bit lighter now. Still working on the excessive weight loss problem. I am carrying plenty of extra food, especially high density protein food like tuna. Also in my pack is protein powder, which I drink at the end of each day. My weight started at 185 pounds and is now 158. I hope to be able to get back into the 165 range. We'll see. On Tuesday Renee and I are heading back north to the trail together. She is going to hike with me for about 50 miles. Should be FUN.

Matt, me and about 3 other hikers said YES PLEASE! There we had a wonderful burger and cool drinks. Good Stuff! After that, we were shuttled back to the trailhead, where we did a little swimming in the stream there just to knock some of the sweat and salt off our clothes (no, there was no skinny dipping, thank you).

This is not a bear problem, this is a people problem. Ignorant hikers leave food in fire pits or practice other bad habits that attract wildlife like raccoons or bears. This was very annoying today, since we had to hike thru closed areas (meaning no camping or even stopping to eat) to get to the next shelter. I was very tired and Matt's feet were hurting at the end of the day.

One guy arrived late - a rather strange dude with a mohawk and carrying a lot of old style gear including a machette. He was not shy about telling everyone how to do things.

Matt's feet are full of blisters so we got a shuttle from route 60 into Lexington, where there is an outfitter. He got a nice pair of trail runners to replace his heavy oversized boots.

For now the hiking is very enjoyable in the crisp air. We ended the day on a mountaintop glade next to a formation called Spy Rock. After setting up camp, we climbed up the rock, which rises slightly above treetop level giving a 360 degree panorama. There we sat in silence with other hikers to watch the most beautiful sunset of the hike so far. Later, Matt and I went back in the dark to check out the stars and distant lights of civilization. Simply stunning!","Lexington, VA
