Mark Koppenhoefer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522513,"My dear friends (and enemies): I’ve decided to embark on a bit of (what my adorable nephew Henry might once have referred to as) a “babenture”.This morning my firm approved my request for a 3-month sabbatical in the spring. I’ve decided to spend that time hiking the bottom half of the Appalachian Trail. I’ll start at the bottom (Georgia) and “follow the spring” up to (roughly) the halfway point.(In a couple years, I’ll take another sabbatical to “follow the fall” down from Maine to that same halfway point.)Aside from the occasional check-in with family and close friends, I expect to be relatively disconnected from technology in general (and social media in particular). The one exception is that I will be posting any photos I take along the way (along with commentary of trials and tribulations (I trust there will be MANY)) to Instagram…SO, if you’d like to join me on MY Walk in the Woods (aka Uncle Mark’s Big Babenture), please feel free to follow along at IG: markstephen1977.",,Uncle Mark's Big Babenture,"Dec 17, Thu",0
Mark Koppenhoefer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522514,"I usually like to post my culinary triumphs. Today I am posting a huge culinary FAIL. I had my Appalachian Trail breakfast all planned out: steel cut oats, walnuts, almond meal, flax meal, coconut powder, dehydrated blueberries, some date sugar and a pinch of stevia. Sounds great, right? What could possibly go wrong? Well, it's completely disgusting. Good thing I did this trial run before filling 90 ziploc bags with the ingredients!",,Oatmeal FAIL,"Jan 18, Mon",0

If you are actually attacked by a bear, you should fight for all you are worth with anything at hand."" #themoreyouknow",,Tips from the AT Conservancy...,"Jan 28, Thu",0

Mark Koppenhoefer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522522,"Friends, this aluminum camp trowel - the aptly named Deuce of Spades - is the culmination of what will probably end up having been the most enjoyable part of my Appalachian adventure: shopping for gear. It's all downhill from here...except for all those mountains I'll be climbing...those will be uphill...but I mean, from an enjoyability standpoint, all downhill...",,The Deuce of Spades,"Feb 15, Mon",0

Mark Koppenhoefer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522526,"Q: Are you taking a gun?A: No...Q: What if you're attacked by a bear?A: I'll fight back.Q: What if you hear dueling banjos in the distance and are accosted by hillbillies?A: Hmm...I guess I'll squeal like a pig...? ;-)I think it's unlikely that I'd be accosted by nefarious, horny hillbillies (tho one can always hope!)...and unlikelier still that I'd be attacked by a bear. Black bears are notoriously skittish. A couple months ago a Youtube video came across my feed (perhaps you saw it too) of a small (not more than 12 pound) dog scaring off two black bears rummaging around that dog's house for food. That pretty much allayed any fears I might have had with regard to black bears. Also, there are no brown bears (like the one that mauled Leo in The Revenant) on the AT.",,Squeal like a pig...,"Mar 04, Fri",0
Mark Koppenhoefer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522695,"Today my Anker solar panel passed its first test with flying colors. I put it on the 15th floor terrace of my building in Chelsea this afternoon in direct sunlight to see how quickly it would charge my (directly connected) iPhone 6 Plus. My phone was in airplane mode and at 75%.I checked an hour later hoping my phone might be up to, say, 80%. And it was completely full!! No doubt this solar panel (and the companion battery I'm taking) will keep my iPhone (as well as my Kindle and rechargeable headlamp) fully charged.Downside: while the financial cost was quite reasonable, the cost in terms of pack weight is not inconsiderable. At 14.7 and 12.5 ounces, respectively, the solar panel and PowerCore 20100 battery (also by Anker) will be the two heaviest items in my pack after the pack itself, my tent, my bag, and my mattress.(Gear list will be forthcoming.)",,Energy Independence,"Mar 06, Sun",0

Mark Koppenhoefer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523693,"This is becoming very real.A while back this was just some far off thing I could brag about to family and friends. Now suddenly I'm staring down the barrel of 1,100 miles of cold and rain and misery and heat and sun and heatstroke and sunburn and bugs and bears and snakes and spiders and, worst of all, other people like me...Q: what's your goal? Mileage? Destination?A: my goal is to have an adventure......AKA a babenture. I think it would be pretty great if I made it all the way to Bear Mountain, which is not far from NYC. But Harrisburg Pennsylvania (which is roughly the halfway point) is more realistic.BUT if I'm a month in and not enjoying myself, I'll reevaluate.The truth is: I'm not a summer backpacker. I don't love the heat and I love the bugs even less.If the overnight lows start getting into the high 60s, I think I'll be done. Sleep is important to me - and it's hard enough when you're camping - and I just don't think I can sleep in that kind of heat.I'm expecting nice, cool, spring weather in April and May. But we've also had a warmish winter, so who knows...I'll be in the mountains, so that should help, but who knows...So, long story long, I'm not trying to get to a certain place. I'm not trying to cover a certain amount of ground or accumulate a certain number of miles.I might make it to New York. I might make it to Pennsylvania. I might make it to Virginia. I might not make it off of Springer Mountain!!As my Mom told me a million times when I was a kid who desperately wanted something or other: ""We'll see...""",,Two weeks away...,"Mar 16, Wed",0
