Blue Ray,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561283,"Arrived at Atlanta airport and took the tram to the end of the line where I was picked up by ???. He drove me to the grocery store then to the Lodge at Amicalola Falls. After checking in and lunch, I hiked a mile downhill on a side trail. I registered at the visitor center as the 285th thru hiker and hiked the first mile of the approach trail which includes the 600+ steps up the falls. After a buffet dinner at the lodge, I packed up my gear and went to bed.","

Blue Ray,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561284,"I hiked the remaining 7.8 miles of the approach trail. Someone offered me a ride to Springer Mountain but I declined. Saw my first trail magic; a bag of clean city clothes. Passed ???, an older hiker with a 45 pound pack and a duffle bag in one hand. He had never set up a tent before but I later learned that Tailgate helped him when he got to Springer. I hiked past the shelter at Springer and set up my hammock on the side of the trail in the rain.","Amicalola Lodge

Blue Ray,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561285,Hiked to Hawk Mountain Shelter. Met Good Life while hiking and really enjoyed his company. Lots of people here. I thought it would be good to hammock away from the shelter. After I was all set up I noticed I was right by the privy. I didn't socialize and pretty much kept to myself. It felt like the first days of school.,"Springer Mountain

Blue Ray,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561286,"Small talk with a few folks on the trail including Hopscotch. Everyone was going to Gooch. When I got there it was packed and I set up my hammock pretty far down the hill from the shelter. I took my food up to the shelter to cook but the table was packed so I sat on the ground and ate. Afterwards I made an effort to talk with everyone I could. I met Pilgrim, Darwin, Legs, and many others. I used the bear box for all my food.","Hawk Mountain Shelter
