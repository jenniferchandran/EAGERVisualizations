LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582278,"Getting inserted. Cloudy with some sunny breaks with a thunderstorm.I'm not sure what to expect on this trip and I am not putting any undo expectations or demands on it that would make me feel badly for not making a particular goal. I was on the 9:30 Dartmouth Coach from South Station and arrived in front of the Hanover Inn at noon. I found the local Subway, ate lunch, and was on the trail by 12:30. Shortly after arriving at this shelter it rained heavily for an hour and then I just relaxed and took some pictures for the rest of the day. I'm the only one here tonight.","Hanover, NH

LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582279,"Walked On. Morning clouds then sun and afternoon temps in the 80's.
I was on the trail by 6:40 and saw a couple of day hikers as well as a couple places that trail magic was left for us hikers. I arrived in the shelter area around 3 o'clock and settled in. Then another section hiker, Food Bank, showed up having started this morning in Hanover. It is just he an I at the shelter tonight.
Besides today's trail magic, I experienced a bit of fortune at the shelter this morning. As I was policing the shelter yesterday afternoon, I found some perfectly good TP and a working lighter. As it turned out, I had plenty of TP with me so I left that at the shelter but, I somehow had no lighter to light my cooking system. On this trip I am not carry a traditional stove but a small stand and little blocks of solid fuel that will burn for about 7 minutes each, just enough time to heat about 2 cups of water. But I need to ignite them with a flame and so the lighter is necessary.
I had a good walk but on my way up the slopes of Mouse Mountain my legs really started aching and I was glad to call it a day upon reaching the shelter.","Velvet Rocks Shelter

LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582280,"I hiked on. The Weather was good with clear skies and 80's temps.It was a long day today and I must try to avoid doing long climbs at the end of the day. It took me forever to get up to this peak and the cabin. I had to stop and rest way too many times and I nearly ran out of water. I know I got dehydrated by the hot and dry conditions on the side of the mountain. A short way before the top, there was some running water across the trail that I was able to fill my water containers and bring with me up to the cabin. Shortly after arriving at 8 PM, I had a small snack and just crashed for the evening. I am by myself in the cabin but Food Bank is here in a tent and others are here as well. I had left the shelter this morning before Food Bank but he passed me as I was taking an extended lunch break at Trapper John Shelter. The first part of the trail today went up Holts Ledge but it was on the descent that I encountered a group of Japanese day hikers. After lunch, I stopped at Bill Ackerley's for ice cream which he generously provides to hikers as well as the comfort of his porch and lawn. I didn't see anybody there so after a while I continued on up to the top of the mountain.After arriving and settling into the cabin, I saw Food bank who had gotten here 2 hours before me. He told me then about meeting Bill's daughter at his house and the unfortunate news of Bill's passing just 3 days before. Wow, I could tell that he will be missed for everything he has done for the hiker community.","Mouse Mountain Shelter

LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582281,"A little more walking. Because it was so painful to walk today and I needed to recover from my long day yesterday. Again the weather is sunny and warm, into the 80's with bugs at times.I tried to sleep in this morning but I was up at 7 and made coffee. Food Bank stopped by and gave me some soft turkey jerky which I had for breakfast. I relaxed some, climbed the fire tower and took photos before heading out around 9:30. I stopped for water and to cleanup after I had taken a stumble into knee deep muck in a bog. There were a couple of good uphill climbs with the last being the 0.3 mile side trail to this shelter.I cooked a dinner shortly after arriving at 2 and then relaxed and visited with the many other hikers that are here tonight, Food Back among them. It's amazing how sometimes you meet people that come and go on this trail and you meet up with them when you least expect it.","Fire Warden's Cabin

LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582282,"Broiling! Very hot and humid today with temp's pushing into the 90's by the afternoon.
I have decided that I will walk out to the next road crossing and either walk up to the Mt. Sugar Cube Farm or try to hitch to the Hikers Welcome Hostel in Glencliff. I am hurting a lot in my leg muscles and with the heat it is difficult to sustain a pace and am struggling to make it to the next shelter. I also found out that the shelter at Ore Hill has not been rebuilt after it burned recently and it would take me way too long to walk the 10 miles to Glencliff.
So, after leaving the shelter this morning I immediately met Tag-a-long and D'tour at the AT and shelter trail intersection. They passed me on the climb up Mt. Cube and in a short interchange found them to be a very engaging couple. D'tour has a very dry sense of humor cracking joke after joke while staying in a very serious voice. I would see them again at the Hostel tonight after they walked the 10 miles that I hitched. Food Bank caught up to me on the backside of My. Cube at the stream crossing where I would fill up as it is a very warm day with bright sunny skies. The top of Mt Cube is forested unless you take the North Peak side trail which takes you out to some nice views to the north and east.  At the road crossing he and I stopped and had lunch before he headed on up the trail while I had decided to end this section by hitching up to the Hiker Welcome Hostel. Even though the hike today was short, the good weather meant I saw lots of day hikers many of them with dogs.
It took two rides to get there and I arrived around 2:30. Others here are Tin Man and Brent and some others. D'tour and Tag-a-long arrived near dinner time and Food Bank struggled in just as it became dark and was able to secure the last bunk. I'm glad I didn't try to do what he did as he is in much better shape than I am.
The afternoon was spent settling in, showering, and just relaxing and talking to hikers. I did take some photos and then struck up a conversation with a woman waiting to pick up her husband, Brian, after his hike over Mt. Mousilauke. She was very interesting and we talked about many things trail then asked if I wanted to go for an ice cream, which we did just as Brian came walking in. She drove us down to Moose Tracks in Warren where the temperature was pushing 100 degrees and our ice cream cones melted into our hands. It was great talking to them as they had thru hiked in 2010 and also had first hand knowledge of the infamous Bismark, who was the fugitive embezzler caught at last year's Trail Days celebration in Damascus. They dropped me back at the hostel around 5.I indulged in a $5 dinner package, Celeste pizza, soda, and ice cream bar, for dinner then a video movie before hitting the sack. It was hot and the mattress was too soft so I had a difficult time getting to sleep. I dozed off around midnight.","Hexacuba Shelter

LeeBo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582283,"Got a shuttle to Lincoln, then bused and train back to Norwood. Since I am not hiking I guess this is a zero day.
I was was awake with the morning dawn and down stairs for coffee by 6:15 then ready to leave at the 7:30 shuttle trip. We stopped at a local quick stop for a breakfast sandwich then dropped Food Bank, Tag-a-long and D'tour on the northside of Mt Moosilauke for their slack pack back to the hostel. I was then dropped off at the bus stop in Lincoln to wait for the 1:30 bus back to Boston. I had wait several hours but I did see the bus arrive and did not miss it as I had in Tennessee.","Hiker Friendly Hostel
