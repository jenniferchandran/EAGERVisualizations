Dooda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497134,"Today I packed my new Gregory Deva 70 pack with all of the gear I have been accumulating since January when I decided to hike 1/2 of the AT next summer. I love the way the pack fits and feels and rides. I don't love that it weighs almost 6 lbs. empty! So today I packed it with everything, including 2L water, except food. It weighed 21 lbs. If it mostly weights under 30 lbs I'll be happy. I'm going to an REI in Va. next week and will bring it loaded and have them help me fit it and pack it.I finished reading Appalachian Trials and really enjoyed it. After so much ""how-to"" and gear research, it was nice to get Zach's perspective on what to expect personally and emotionally. I made my statements:  I am Hiking the Appalachian Trail because…- I have been intrigued by the AT for many years - it's calling me.- later may be too late.- it is time to do something for me- my youngest child is off to college - Empty nest=new stage of life- I want to celebrate turning 60 with something epic- I want to do something physically and mentally challenging - I've never been on my own or done my own thing and want to try- I want to prove to myself that I CAN do whatever I put my mind to.- I want to learn, have fun, see and experience new things.- I love hiking and camping, the woods and nature.When I successfully hike the Appalachian Trail, I will…- be so proud of myself for accomplishing such a monumental adventure.- have something that no one can take away from me.- have the confidence to do anything I set my mind to.- have faced my fears head on and squashed them.- have new friends.- have a story to tell.If I give up on the Appalachian Trail, not counting sickness, injury or some other serious reason, I will…- have to tell all my friends and family that I tried but couldn’t do it- spend a lot of time figuring out what went wrong- still be proud of myself for doing my best and stepping outside my comfort zone.- probably try againI'm still thinking about mail drops - I don't usually eat junk food and mostly don't eat wheat, so I can't see buying food in trail towns. I know I'd eat better and more tasty food if I dehydrate meals and mail boxes. I'm just not sure if I want to be tied to the kind of coordinating and schedule that will require. Lots to work on! I'm really looking forward to 5 day shake-down hike with Devon in August.",,AT May 2016,"May 01, Fri",0
Dooda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531542,"Well, after 17 months of planning, acquiring gear, research, shake-down hikes, tweaking gear, preparing food and mail drops, I leave for Springer Mountain in one week. I feel prepared, anxious, nervous, excited - it's hard to sleep at night. Here is the plan: I'm meeting a friend who is also hiking the AT starting in Georgia, on Sunday, May 15. We will drive her two cars down, where I will leave the one I'm driving at the parking area at the top of Springer Mountain, the southern terminus of the AT. I will camp near there and begin hiking north the next morning. We are not hiking together - she is doing a solo hike with a two-car shuttle - but I will cross paths with her frequently. I'm doing the first 470 miles, to Damascus, VA, solo, although I'll most likely meet other hikers along the way to spend time with. My sister will be meeting me in southern VA to do a week or two, then meet me again in Waynesboro VA to finish up the last stretch to Harper's Ferry- a total of 1023 miles for me. I'm having food re-supplies mailed to me about every 5 to 7 days (THANK YOU, Diane and Isabelle!), all to businesses or hostels where I will most likely stay (and get a shower and do laundry.) Paul will meet me in southern VA and spend some time fishing, visiting old friends and picking me up from the trail each evening to stay with various people. My other sister will meet us in Front Royal for an evening at her house and then Paul and my son, Adam, will join us for the final four days to Harper's Ferry. I'm not planning to write updates from the trail but will try to post some pictures and update when I'm in a town. I'm working very hard to make myself approach this with flexibility and a go-with-the-flow attitude. Even though I've planned out a day-by-day schedule for the entire 90 days (not too obsessive, am I?) I'd really like to focus on the journey and my time in the woods. I'll have to keep working on that! Thank you all for your support and encouragement, and to Paul for helping me make this happen.

I was able to spend some time with her last weekend and said my goodbyes , knowing I would probably not see her again. She was an amazing person, a wonderful mother, and played tennis and golf at age 79 until a back injury, surgery and meds started a downward spiral ending in the dementia that took her mind and then her body. My sisters and I are sad but glad her long struggle is over. I'll have lots of time to remember and reminisce while I'm hiking.

Had to wait out one downpour with thunder and lightning under a thick grove of rhododendrons in a gap - did not want to be up on the next ridge. Rain again the next day. Soggy boots and socks gave me a new bunch of blisters but handling them ok. We have to stay in shelters in the park- helps keep the bears away from the people. We saw 2 bears the first day! Spooked us so we hiked with a man carrying bear spray off and on for the next three days. And sang lots of songs loudly, and badly, to make our presence known.

The shelters are usually low, near a water source, so there is always a climb first thing. I crest the hill and the sun is shining sideways through the trees. Emerald, lime green, gold, yellow and every shade between. Open sunny meadows, dark mossy enchanted forests, clear sunny woods, shadowed rhododendron tunnels. Sometimes the trail is covered with little green leaves, shaken loose from some tree high above. Or littered with tiny pale pink petticoats from the last blooming Mt Laurels.

All systems are working really well- legs strong, knees good, gear and equipment working for me. The only problem is my feet, as predicted. I have blisters off and on, which I'm successfully dealing with, except my right pinky toe. It folds under and pinches under the next, forming a blister along the bottom edge. I handles it for the first 250 miles but now it's bad. In trying to keep the blister on top of blister drained , I accidentally cut off a section of skin and now granulated tissue has formed in the end, poking through the hole, not healing and hurting so badly. I got a shuttle off the trail yesterday morning and met a Gen Practition MD who said soak in Epsom salts throughout the day. I'll take another day off and hope it heals. Plus I have to find a reliable way to keep my toe round and not pinched. Right now I'm working with a plastic sewing thimble with the end cut off.

We parted at Nantahala Outdoor Center when they stayed for a zero day. My sister joined me for the Smokeies. I heard from other hikers that Zinger had left the trail and that Tracy , now Thud, was behind me a couple of days. I left notes for her in the shelter logs, hoping she would catch up to me. Devon joined me again, but her bum knee slowed us way down. Just as we were waiting for Rib to pick her up, Thud caught us. I hiked with her for several days then left the trail for my week of visiting an slack packing in Blacksburg. Just before I was getting back on the trail I texted Thud to see where she was.

Dooda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544258,"Mile 834, day 70. Once we were up near Spy Rock, it was only an 800 foot climb up The Priest. Then there was a 3000 foot descent to the Tye River. A quick soak to cool off, then a 3000 foot climb up to Three Ridges Mountain. That was our last point over 4000' elevation.","

Dooda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544260,"Mile 900, day 74. The 900 mile mark is in the Shenandoah National Park along Skyline Drive. I did a 20 mile hike at the south end of the park and will hike a 15 mile section at the north end. But I have missed most of the middle for a variety or reasons: 1) my hiking partner, Tracy, had to leave the trail due to a chronic back nerve pain, 2) the bear issues in SNP are out of control with closed picnic areas, bears in campgrounds and recommendations that people hike in groups, 3) the temperatures have been in the 90s all week - I had already hiked 5 days in those conditions, which includes a scarcity of water, and had some heat exhaustion issues. So, I'm taking a few days off at sister Devon's lake house and will hit the trail on Tuesday and finish the 5 days to Harper's Ferry on Sunday, August 7. I'll pass the 1000 mile mark but will have covered 954 by the end.","

Dooda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544702,"Mile 972, day 80. After a couple of days at lake house avoiding the heat, Devon drove me to the north end of SNP where I hiked a day with Denise Vowell, my driving buddy from the first day. Then one overnight with sister Denise in Winchester and hit the trail again in Front Royal. Just north of Front Royal is this shelter, the Jim and Molly Denton shelter, built and maintained by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club. I stopped there for a snack in the middle of my 23 mile day. It is lovely, with a separate cooking and eating pavilion, horse shoes and playing area, large deck, double decker bunk area and spring fed (cold) solar heated (not really, since it's in the woods) shower. Definitely one of the nicest on the trail.","

Dooda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544703,"Mile 995, day 81. Seeing these yellow leaves on the trail really brought home the fact that I've been out here a long time. When I left it was spring in Georgia, with nighttime lows in the 40s. Then lush green, spring growth. Then thick, dark towering forests in NC.  Now there are colorful leaves in the woods and on the trail. These Tulip Poplar leaves are the earliest to turn in the fall. They remind me of my family's home in Annandale, Va. where there were towering Tulip trees near the house.","

Dooda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544705,"Mile 990, day 80. In the middle of Sky Meadows State Park I came across this sign at a trail crossing. Once I finished this day and spent the night at my sister Denise's house, I would have only two more days of hiking and my Epic Birthday Adventure would end. What an amazing thing. The first 600 miles seems unreal, like it was a long time ago or a different trip. I recently read my daily journal I wrote in each night. . . Oh, yeah, I remember that campsite or that hiker or that shelter. It reminded me that I really DID do that and how exciting and fun it all was. I am so lucky to have had this opportunity.","

Dooda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544707,"Mile 980, day 80. Every day I notice something a trail crew has built or re-built or repaired or mowed or weed-whacked. I've hiked past dozens of people out working on the trail over the 3 months I've been out here. They are talking and laughing and sweating and working hard. And always say ""You're welcome. Have a great hike!"" When I thank them for their hard work and service. Here is just one of the areas with 100 yards of board walkways in boggy areas, this one at least two miles from the nearest road. Thank you to all the trail crews- their hard work made my hike possible!","

For my last two days on the trail my hubby Paul and son Adam joined me at Snickers Gap to hike 11 miles to the David Lesser Memorial Shelter for the night.

When we get into Harper's Ferry, all thru and section hikers check in at the ATC Headquarters and get their picture taken for the 2016 hiker photo album. There is also a hiker log book.

Dooda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545326,I have been so blessed to have the support and encouragement of so many of my friends and my family. Several of our friends from college came to Harper's Ferry to welcome me back and celebrate with us. This has been such a fantastic experience - something I'll think about and remember for the rest of my life. I'm so glad I decided to keep a journal and share it with all of you. Taking pictures and writing about my trip made it even more fun and gives me a record that I can revisit whenever I want. Happy trails from Dooda!,"
