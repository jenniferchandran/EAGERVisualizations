Food Bag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520720,"After all of my gear list planning based on recommendations and research I finally purchased everything and was eager to use it. One of my best friends who has experience hiking with her husband agreed to come on this short trip with me (Shout out to Marta, you are awesome!!). The plan was to camp out Monday night so that we could get an early start the next day and hike the 35 mile route over the week arriving back to our car Friday afternoon. Monday Feb. 1st : We met up at 4:30pm to drop off one of our cars at parking lot #7 in Huntsville and then back tracked to lot #1 where we started our journey. After hiking for about half a mile, we found a place to stay for the night near a pond (not the best source of water but it’s something) and set up camp. For dinner I made mac and cheese with 1/2 a can of dehydrated chicken and it was delicious.Tuesday Feb. 2nd : We woke up at 7am and hiked out at 9am. We planned on hiking 10 miles but when we got there found out the pond on our map didn't exist and the next guaranteed body of water was Lake Conroe just passed the 16 mile marker. It wasn’t ideal by any stretch of the imagination especially since Marta’s pack wasn’t balanced (which caused shoulder knots) and she felt blisters forming but she trudged on and we made it to the campsite by 5pm. Lake Conroe has never looked better than that moment we got past the woods and entered the clearing to see it’s glimmering surface. It felt so good to dip my feet in the cold water and eat red beans and rice with dehydrated chicken. Wednesday Feb. 3rd : We woke up at 7:30am and hiked out at 9:30am. While we were a bit slower to get going we stretched and powered through to complete another 9 miles. We took breaks at least every two hours and ate a lot… seriously I felt like a garbage disposal whereas when we first started I couldn’t finish the big meals and protein bars I devoured them and wanted more. We found a place to make camp at 3:30pm and took the rest of the day easy which was great since the temperature dropped to the low 30’s (please remember I’m from Texas so this is cold haha) and we were prepared and cozy in the tent. Thursday Feb. 4th : We woke up at 7am and hiked out at 8:15am. The saying “nut up or shut up,” comes to mind. While we’d initially planned on completing our hike on Friday our extra mileage the first day gave us the push we needed to finish on Thursday and that’s exactly what we did. We hiked consistently throughout the morning taking short breaks and made it out of the woods by (drum roll please) 12:30pm!!When it was all said and done we hiked 35 miles in 2.5 days and I got to use all of my gear and see how it faired. Results: I love my tent, it is so easy to assemble and light weight. The sawyer mini squeeze got clogged twice and was very frustrating to use as it provided such small amounts of clean water. My pack was very practical and it being a top loader helped me ensure the weight was centered; the only issue was I could not return water bottles to the side pockets while walking without asking for help or removing my pack. Oh and a word to the wise when it comes to toilet paper do not be stringent haha.",,"Huntsville, TX","Feb 01, Mon",0
Food Bag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521059,"I finally quit my job this week and have found that when people find out about my upcoming adventure they usually fall in to one of two groups, skeptics or supporters. Regardless of which group someone falls in they all have the same question, “Why did you decide to hike the AT?” I honestly don’t have just one answer, I wanted to take a breather and reevaluate my life and goals, I liked the idea if this intense physical and mental challenge, I wasn’t happy in my current job and didn’t want to change jobs just to be in the same situation, I like proving people wrong, I want to do something that few other women have attempted, etc… You can take your pick from my reasons above but in the end I just want to live life with no regrets and nothing holding me back, not my own fear and especially not that of others.",,"Houston, TX","Feb 12, Fri",0
Food Bag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522246,"This past weekend I visited my Mom to purchase and package supplies to get my drop boxes started. I don't intend on relying on boxes alone for food along my hike but for a few small towns with limited selection and to receive supplements like protein powder, HEED, wild salmon oil, Prescript-Assist Probiotic, etc… We even took some time on Sunday to make homemade bars!Below is what my daily meal plan looks like which adds up to about 3,700-4,200 calories per day. Breakfast: -Oatmeal: 1 cup of instant oats, 1 flavored oatmeal packet, protein powder and 1 tbsp chia seeds Snack 1:-Bar: white chocolate pb crunch bar, dark chocolate cheery energy bites OR survival bar Lunch:-Bagel-Cheddar cheese-Spam OR Tuna-Butterfinger OR Reese’s PB CupsSnack 2:-Trail Mix: ¼ cup craisins, ¼ cup peanuts, ½ cup pb stuffed pretzels, ¼ cup almonds, 2/3 cup granola-Trail Mix Bonus: Peanut M&M’s, PB M&M’s OR Brookside Dark ChocolateDinner: -1 box of Mac & Cheese OR 2 packets of Ramen-Little Debbie Cupcake, Twinkie OR Oreos On my practice hike I started off with 4 days worth of food and my pack weighed in around 36lbs. Since each days food allowance weighs about 2lbs and this time I plan on hiking a week before resupplying my pack will definitely be heavier, hope it all fits!",,"Corpus Christi, TX","Feb 29, Mon",0
Food Bag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524806,"My cousin dropped me off at AFSP entrance just before 8pm as the sun was setting. After so much preparation and growing expectations it still hadn't hit me that I was finally about to start this endeavor. Even now as I hike daily and meet people with the same goal to make it all the way to Maine I can't believe what we have all left behind to accomplish this crazy adventure.Bright and early Saturday morning I gathered my things and headed back to the visitor's center to sign the thru-hiker log book and weigh my pack. I knew I was in trouble when lifting the pack above my head to hook it on to the hanging scale was a bit of a challenge. My pack weighed in at a whopping 52lbs which was about 12-17lbs too many, not the best way to start. The approach trail up to Springer Mountain (where the AT officially begins) sure is a rude awakening with just over 600 steps to the top of the falls and then of course an ascent up the mountain. I was able to make pretty good mileage but unfortunately it was drizzling and foggy all day so visibility was quite limited. I spent the night at Stover Creek Shelter and enjoyed hanging out with everyone until a guy named Smokey woke us all up with his frightening snoring. It was a mixture of Darth Vader meets the Exorcist complete with both words and sounds. Sunday I got to experience rolling hills which may be nice to look at from afar but are a pain in the butt to hike. I had my first trail magic experience when a group of 3 people were on the trail giving out hot apple cider and snacks. As the day went on it got colder and by the time I reached Gooch Mountain Shelter it had lightly snowed off and on. The shelter was full so I pitched my tent and set up camp before trying to get some needed rest.Monday was a long day, I hiked 17 miles from 7am to 5pm in order to pass a 10 mile gap with high bear activity that wouldn't allow hikers without bear canisters (I have a bag) to camp along the trail. Fortunately I was able to tag along with a man called the Professor who was also planning on hiking past Neels Gap that day. When my alarm went off at 6am I wanted to go back to sleep and stay in my warm sleeping bag but I got up and going only to find a fresh layer of snow to greet me. While it was cold and the wind was fierce it was a gorgeous morning for hiking. About 7 miles in to the hike I managed to trip and fall landing partially on my right ankle before it rolled out from under me. It was quite painful but no one was around so I just got up and hiked on and to my surprise it wasn't too bad as long as I put most of my weight on the left foot. Not only was this a high mileage day but it also meant conquering Blood Mountain (adequately named with it's steep south side) which had an amazing view from the top but descending it with my bad ankle was intense. I made it to the base of the mountain and passed through Neels Gap where 20% of hikers give up to Bull Gap campsite. It was that night that I entertained a few of my fellow hikers while attempting to hang my food bags (yes plural) that I was given the trail name Food Bag! Tuesday was my favorite day since the sun was shining and it was finally warm enough to just wear a short sleeve shirt. Half way through the day some men were giving trail magic and I got coffee, snacks and batteries for my head lamp . I made a pit stop at Low Gap Shelter and came across a group of guys more than happy to take some of my access food off of me. It was so fun to see them enjoy my extra rations and have a lighter pack, win win. I hiked to the campsite Poplar Stamp Gap and called it a day.Wednesday was another beautiful day and my third trail magic experience which I managed to get to right in time for lunch! I hiked 14 miles (my second longest day) and got to Tray Mountain Shelter which was packed and even had a few solo female hikers. Thursday the goal was to beat everyone else to Deep Gap Shelter since rain was predicted in the afternoon and I had no desire to be caught in it. I got to the shelter at 11:55am and ended up spending the rest of the day hanging out with fellow like-minded hikers and relaxing, not a bad day. Today I hiked a few miles in the early morning fog in order to beat my fellow shelter mates and get to the Top of Georgia Hostel. When I arrived to coffee and biscuits with jam and butter it was well worth the early rise. As my clothes were washed I finally got to shower for the first time in a week and man did it feel good to scrub off the layered dirt. Not to get too in to it but my skin has definitely reacted to the dirt and sweat, I haven't had this much acne since high school... Hope my body gets used to the grunge. Well sorry I went on and on, this week has been such a neat and new experience I just had to tell you all about it. I'll be heading in to Hiawassee, GA soon to mail back some items home and treat myself to a big meal!!","Amicalola Falls State Park

Food Bag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525620,"Day eight on the trail (March 26th) I woke up early at the Top of Georgia Hostel and had a wonderful breakfast of coffee and homemade baked goods. Before leaving I weighed my pack which came out to 40lbs ??. For only a week on the trail dropping so much pack weight was a huge feat. Especially since that was including a food bag with 5 days of rations that weighed 10.5lbs (still a bit heavy but I eat a lot lol) and 2 liters of water. I was back on the trail by 9am and crossed my first state border in to North Carolina by lunch! I made it to Muskrat Creek Shelter by 2:45pm and decided to stop there and rest my still recovering ankle. Another woman named Captain Ahab was at the shelter and shortly after a man I'd never seen before arrived. He made some small talk and seemed nice enough but then when he went to pitch his tent he started speaking and laughing to himself... I was a bit creeped out and very relieved when more guys showed up an hour later. Easter Sunday I woke to an intense fog that never really let up and the whole day I hiked in mist and occasional rain showers. Regardless of the weather a group called the Omelet Angels set up tents near the trail and provided the most amazing trail magic ever... Made to order omelets with bread and meat ??. In addition to the omelet feast they even had us put down on a menu (yes you read that right) what we would like in our takeaway sandwich pack. I couldn't believe the generosity of this group and will say that they made my day as well as all of the fellow hikers who experienced the trail magic. Monday the sun came out and I was so glad as the final ascent of Albert Mountain was quite steep so it was much safer and meant we had a fantastic view. Two miles from Rock Gap Shelter where I camped I came across my first snake which was green and about a foot long. Tuesday everyone at the campsite was super motivated to get up and moving as almost everyone had plans to hitch hike in to the nearby town of Franklin (mainly for the beer lol). I resisted the temptation of town and was rewarded with two trail magic experiences! About 4 miles in to my hike a man was giving coffee, peanut butter cookies and fruit. Then at the very end of my day at the top of Wayah Bald Tower an old thru-hiker had a whole rest station with a med kit (if needed), drinks and snacks (I ate 5 donuts haha). Since most of the hikers I've come to know the last few days went in to town most of the people at the shelter were new to me either because they started before me and are just hiking slowly or are section hiking. It's crazy how easily you bond with fellow hikers once you've shared a shelter/campsite for a few nights. Wednesday was a long day... I hit the trail by 8:20am and wasn't expecting the hike to be too intense to Rufus Morgan Shelter especially since it was mostly down hill. The hike up to Wesser Bald ended up being quite an ascent. Fortunately Raudir and I enjoyed having lunch at the top of the bald where a tower was located with amazing panoramic views. The afternoon was when the descent was supposed to begin but we just kept going up and down. Then when we finally started going down it was steep and rough. By the time we reached the shelter myself as well as Raudir and Andy (two hiking buddies I've made) were exhausted. By 6pm I was starving and ate two packets of ramen with a packet of tuna and for dessert a Butterfinger and Oreos with hot cocoa.Today we hiked a mile further and reached the Nantahala Outdoor Center where we plan on staying the entire day to run errands and enjoy cheeseburgers, pizza and beer. The neat thing is that I came to the NOC with my friend Andre around September of 2016 for white water rafting and recall seeing hikers going Southbound and thinking how intriguing that sounded and now I am one of them!! Figures and Fun Facts:Average daily mileage (first 13 days): 11.2 Avg daily low elevation: 2,917Avg daily high elevation: 4,505Hiker TV includes: watching fire, watching each other hang bear bags, watching the strange meals people assemble and of course observing nature including sunrises and sunsets","Hiawassee, GA

Food Bag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526615,"Day 14 (Friday) was by far the toughest day of hiking so far. While taking a zero at the NOC was great, hiking out of it was a nightmare since you go from an elevation of 1749 to 5062 ??. Raudir and I headed out around 8:45am and while it wasn't raining it was extremely humid and foggy. Within the first 30 minutes of our hike we were drenched in sweat and I stayed like that the rest of the day. Once we got to the highest point of the day at Cheoah Bald we weren't done yet as there were several more PUDs before getting to ""Jacob's Ladder"" which was a pretty rough climb, especially at the end of the day. In total we hiked 15.5 miles that day and stayed at the Brown Fork Gap Shelter. We entered a new bubble and met about 8 new hikers, two of the boys had graduated high school early just to thru-hike the AT. However they plan on going home to attend prom, teenagers haha. Saturday on the other hand was a breeze, we reached the Fontana Dam Shelter (ie the ""Hilton"") by 2pm. There was a man giving away ice cold Mountain Dews and I just drank the soda while stretching in the grass under the sun. We had a little hiker party that night since the shelter accommodates 20 hikers plus those that camped around it. Seriously the shelter was amazing, there was easily accessible water, a solar paneled charging station, a patio with an amazing view of the water and bathrooms with... Showers!! Sunday we had perfect hiking weather, cold and sunny. Our little 4 person group consisting of myself, Raudir, Sweeper and Caboose (a father and daughter from Maine) entered the Great Smoky Mountains and hiked 17.3 miles to Spence Field Shelter. We had planned on hiking 13.9 miles to Russell Field Shelter but shortly after arriving there a woman told us her friend resting in the shelter was sick and would be assisted out of the mountains the next day... That was all the motivation needed to push on. Oh and while it stunk having to pay $20 for a permit to hike in the Smokies I will say the shelters are quite nice. All of them have bear cables, most have privy's and some of the shelters even have fireplaces!Monday was another rough day and what made it more challenging was that I was dehydrated. I hadn't drank enough water  the day before and continuing to hike at such a high elevation under the sun was killer. When we finally made it to Double Spring Gap Shelter I made sure to drink plenty of water and added an electrolyte drink mix. All of us were running quite low on food and rather than have a short day the following day we decided to make it a bit longer to get to the gap where we could hitch a ride in to Gatlinburg. Knowing we would be able to resupply the next day meant that we could eat two dinners!! First I had one of those bagged hiker meals (veggie burrito bowl flavored) that a nice section hiker (thanks Alison!) gave to me, then I made a pack of nacho cheese instant mashed potatoes and finally a butterfinger for dessert. While making dinner a fellow hiker had a stove malfunction. The whole thing lit up and ended up burning through his entire supply of fuel before going out, that was our entertainment for the night (don't worry no one was hurt).Tuesday we were on the trail by 7am hoping to make it to Newfound Gap by lunch time. We hiked at a solid pace and were at the top of Clingmans Dome by 8:30am and man was the view something to behold. At an elevation of 6655 feet it is the highest point of the entire Appalachian Trail! Another fun milestone for the day was shortly after we hit 200 miles on the trail ??. We got to the gap at noon and had trail magic waiting for us from a local church group. In addition to giving us snacks and drinks they also gave us a ride in to Gatlinburg, TN which is 15 miles from the trail. Gatlinburg was referenced as a ""tourist mecca"" in our guide books and after arriving all I can say is wow. In addition to all of the restaurants, stores and distilleries (moonshine) you seriously can't go a block without a place enticing you to have your pictures taken (with a time warp back in the Western days) or get hitched. This place has to be one of the weirdest cities I have ever visited. The worst part however wasn't the crowds or the sensory overload but that the closest grocery store for a good resupply was 3.6 miles away. I know because we walked there with the encouragement from the locals saying it's just another mile or just around the corner... Obviously no one in this dang city walks. To be fair though we enjoyed the food scene as we had Five Guys for lunch and Mellow Mushroom for dinner. Now it's 11pm and I am exhausted, waking up early tomorrow to get back on the trail!","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Food Bag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527299,"Day 19 on the trail (Wednesday, April 6) we woke up early and enjoyed the hotels continental breakfast before heading to the NOC store to get a ride back to Newfound Gap. When we got back to the trail everyone hiked at their own pace. Coming out of town is always rough mainly because you're carrying 6-10lbs more food than you were coming in. It was a cold, windy day which was fine while hiking but freezing once you slowed down. Fortunately I was able to get a spot in the  Tri-Corner Knob Shelter and they had a fire going. What really made it cozy was that we fit at least 26 people on the ledges and floor of the shelter that was supposed to fit 12, that's how cold it was. Thursday I finally got out of my toasty sleeping bag at 6:45am and braved the cold to go pee (I'd been holding it for at least 4 hours). When I pulled back the tarp a winter wonderland was before me. There was a layer of snow at least 2-3 inches thick over everything! It was cold while getting up and going but when I started hiking it was wonderful. The sun was above me and a gorgeous snow covered wilderness all around me. I hiked at a fast pace and made it to Davenport Gap Shelter by 3pm and was surprised to see that the exposed side of the three walled shelter had a metal chain link fence (for bears) making it feel like a cage. Friday we finally left the Smoky Mountains, they are a beautiful mountain range but having to stay at shelters really limits you mileage flexibility and makes for much more crowded sites. I wasn't ready for the challenge of that days journey. Not only was it my new biggest mileage day at 18.7 miles but it included hiking up Snowbird Mountain and Max Patch Summit. The mistake I made was stripping down to my short sleeve wool shirt when initially hiking up to avoid sweating through my fleece only to soon find myself surrounded by snow and cold, windy weather. Being the stubborn person I am I decided to just keep hiking and ended up burning a lot of energy trying to stay warm leaving me quite exhausted by mile 12 or so. Before the final ascent of the day I was blessed with trail magic by a woman who was waiting to pick up her husband who is also thru-hiking. She had an amazing spread of sodas, donuts, cookies, string cheese, bananas and Pringles!! She turned my day right around and I was able to keep going with much more spunk and make it to Roaring Fork Shelter before it started snowing. Saturday I woke up to more snow but it had lost it's luster after being the third day in a row and I just really wanted to be warm. The best part of the day was hitting Garenflo Gap about 12 miles in to the day around lunch time and finding more trail magic. A father and daughter from Atlanta, GA who had completed their thru-hike in 2014 were giving out hot dogs, snacks and Sweet Water beer! After gorging myself I managed to hike another 3.4 miles to Deer Park Mountain Shelter. Today I arrived in Hot Springs, NC a town the trail goes straight through and plan on spending the rest of the day doing errands. Tomorrow however will be my first full zero mile day when I can completely relax, I'll also be enjoying the hot springs!","Newfound Gap

Food Bag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528188,"Day 25 on the trail (Tuesday, April 12) marked the end of our little break, it was time to leave the cute hiker town of Hot Springs, NC and get back on the AT. We (Sea Biscuit and I) took our time packing and tried to wait and see if the weather would improve but when 10:30am rolled around and it was still raining we decided to start hiking. The first 5 hours of that day were spent in a sort of drizzle/fog but the sun finally came out when I reached Spring Mountain Shelter. We decided to push on a few more miles and stay at a campsite near Allen Gap where another hiker named Shamona ended up joining us for the night. Wednesday was neat because there was about 1 mile of exposed ridge line which was challenging and made for a great view. I hiked to Flint Mountain Shelter and had a great night hanging out by the camp fire, eating marshmallows and meeting new hikers. I even met a southbounder named Rock Man who was completing his thru-hike after recovering from breaking his leg in Erwin, TN. Thursday we hiked 18.9 miles but I made the mistake of rushing through the first 11 miles to get to Sam's Gap after a hiker named Nomad mentioned there would be trail magic. By the time I reached the gap there was no magic in sight and to make matters worse I found out later from Yeti that I had missed trail magic in the first gap by hiking too fast. The best part of the day was reaching the top of Big Bald where you could see hills and mountains for miles. The view was so good we decided to cook dinner up there and it was a meal to remember. We ended the day at Bald Mountain Shelter and in addition to catching up to Fire Cat I met new hikers including a man named Odyssey West who is thru-hiking from New Port, NC to New Port, OR, roughly 3600 miles!!Friday we had planned on taking it easy and stopping just before Erwin, TN but after running in to a group of hikers that had just come from town and hearing about it we pushed on and were at the hostel in plenty of time to make the 5:30pm dinner shuttle. We decided to get Mexican food largely because of all the talk of the jumbo margaritas and man they weren't lying. After one mango margarita I was feeling pretty tipsy so naturally I ordered another. It sounded like a great idea until I got my huge steak burrito and had a hard time finishing everything but I did it! After eating we had thirty minutes to resupply at Walmart and considering my intoxicated state I did a great job and only splurged on a pint of Ben and Jerry's Americone Dream. We finished the day by piling in to a friend's cabin and watching Lord of the Rings. Today I ended up spending the morning hanging out on the hostel porch talking to fellow hikers. We are all about to go in to town for all you can eat pizza and then I'll continue on... It's a good life =).","Hot Springs, NC

Food Bag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529420,"Day 30 on the trail (Sunday, April 17th) started out wet when my small platypus bladder leak turned in to a huge problem. I had noticed the lining toward the top had a small hole the night before but figured it was still okay to use... Wrong! Seconds after putting my pack on I felt water running down my back. In a flash I removed it and pulled out the bladder which in combination with my gear and pressure from my back against it had caused a liter of water to leak out of the top. I was lucky that the trash compactor bag kept the items inside of it dry and by flipping over the pack I was able to get rid of most of the water. However, once the leaking bladder crisis was handled I then had to face the issue that until I get a new one sent to me from REI to replace the defective one (already ordered and should be waiting for me in Damascus, VA) I would have to use my two water bottles. That means at most I'll only be carrying one liter of clean water (using Aquamira drops) on me at the start of the day and will have to fill up the other bottle with the Sawyer filter attached whenever water is available. This method is preferred by some since you carry less water weight but I don't like it because I have to make a lot more stops both to drink water and to go to the restroom since you end up chugging water rather than sipping it over time. Thus the 17.8 miles we hiked to get to Clyde Smith Shelter was just a bit more challenging. I did have lunch with a nice man named Hot Soup who has been hiking the Appalachian Trail Southbound since 1982 in short sections. Another interesting character at camp was Bear Claw a man who hikes in a kilt and carries a sword (used mainly to make fires) haha. Monday was just a great day, the weather was sunny and breezy and we only went 15.5 miles which is an easy day (crazy huh, my trail legs are here). We hit the trail at 8am and hiked up and over Roan Mountain in time to have lunch at the top of Round Bald. We made it to Overmountain Shelter which is a converted barn just after 3pm and spent the afternoon resting on the grass taking in the sun (I sure do have some interesting tan lines already haha). We were making better time than I'd expected so I had a bit of extra food and made a Ramen Bomb... First cook Ramen noodles, when they are soft add 1/2 a pack of instant mashed potatoes and then once it is all mixed in put it on top of cheese and spam in a tortilla then enjoy! Just after dinner a few of our friends showed up who had left Erwin,TN a bit after us so we had a fun little reunion.Tuesday began with a decent climb over some balds that provided spectacular views of the surrounding area. Before lunch I'd officially crossed in to Tennessee for the last time and left North Carolina. I had lunch with a nice guy named Spicy and in the afternoon checked out Jones Falls which was beautiful. I ended the day at Mountaineer Shelter which put me at a total of 402.6 miles for my first month on the Appalachian Trail!! Wednesday started off just like any other day until a bit over 4 miles in to my hike the trail was closed off and a man provided me with a map of an alternate route along a forest service road that was a 7.2 mile detour around the AT. I had seen a fire in the distance the day before which apparently some idiot started and it ended up engulfing a significant portion of the surrounding forest including the trail. As I hiked along the road I saw several fire fighters and trucks passing by but just kept going figuring the best thing I could do was keep hiking and get away from the area. When I was finally able to get back on the trail I could see the fire getting closer and as I climbed up the mountains when I looked down in to the valley I'd come from all I saw was smoke. (I found out from hikers the next day that I was one of the last hikers to be allowed to take the detour. Soon after they stopped letting people through and kept them there for 6 hours before they escorted them through the burning forest to safety, no one was hurt.) Getting taken off and then put back on the trail at random spots caused me to lose where I was on the trail. Fortunately shortly after stopping for lunch I reached the road to head to Kincora Hostel run by none other than Bob Peoples (basically a hiking legend who now helps maintain portions of the trail). The last bit of excitement for the day was when I spotted a lot of movement across the road from Kincora and after a few seconds of waiting saw a coyote (it was so much bigger than any I've seen in Texas). Thursday was the day we hiked to and past the infamous Watauga Lake area and shelter which was closed due to recent bear activity. We (Sweeper, Caboose, Sea Biscuit and me) hiked as a group that day and made it out of the ""Bear Closure"" unscathed (although I'd kind of been hoping to see a bear). After crossing the dam we stopped for lunch and then I high tailed it over the next 4.5 miles since I only had half a liter of water and it was a hot day. I got to Vandeventer Shelter and thought my day was finally over but oh no getting water proved to be quite the trek. Not only was it .3 miles to the water source but it was all down hill and while getting down there stunk coming back up with an almost full water bladder (keep in mind the top leaks so I had to be very careful not to tilt it) and bottle was a pain in the butt! On the bright side the view of the lake and town below was gorgeous from the shelter. Friday was a crazy, wonderful kind of day. It started raining during the night and was still going in the morning when I began hiking. A fellow hiker named Nail Gun was getting picked up by his wife at the TN91 intersection 11.4 miles from the shelter and trail magic was supposed to be waiting for us when we arrived so we were all super motivated to get there regardless of the rain. Just before the road there was a big, orange box chained to a tree which ended up being a permanent trail magic box provided by a local Baptist church which had a cooler of drinks, snacks and some toiletries. Caboose and I had a soda and zebra cakes before moving on. As promised Mrs. Nail Gun (she really deserves her own trail name as this is the second time she has given us trail magic, the first being before Max Patch) was there and had an even bigger spread then before. I ate at least 6 Krispy Kreme donuts, 5 bags of chips (the variety pack kind) and an assortment of other goodies . It's always fun to just eat and hang out but about an hour later we braved the rain again and hiked on. Only 6.5 miles later at Low Gap we arrived to more trail magic provided by a group of old thru-hikers! The coolest thing was that one of the guys hosting the cookout was Bubba a hiker I'd reached out to for advice while preparing for my hike, it sure is a small world. After enjoying a burger, hot dog, snacks and even a beer I continued hiking and with all of the sugar and breaks ended up hiking a total of 22.7 miles to Abingdon Gap Shelter (my new and probably will be for a while highest mileage day)!! Saturday I hit the trail early and was hiking just over 3 miles an hour due to the easy terrain and motivation to get in to town. I crossed in to Virginia (the never-ending state so I've heard) and met a lovely Southbounder named Mountain Man. My first impression of Damascus is that it is a great hiker town and I'm excited to hang out here for the day! PS...1) I went 8 days without showering and surprisingly wasn't too gross (at least not to me haha) but will make sure to take one at least once a week for general hygiene maintenance. 2) I almost never drank soda before the hike and now am constantly dreaming about ice, cold Mountain Dew when it gets really hot.3) I have some how managed to lose 5lbs even eating so much food.4) I am horrible at posting pictures on this site so if you would like to see pics just check out my Instagram: noshingthrulife","Erwin, TN

Food Bag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531049,"** I am looking for a ride South to Damascus, VA to attend trail days May 13-15. I would like to get there by Thursday the 12th and at that time will be a few days out of Daleville,VA. If you plan on attending and will be in the area and can give me a ride please let me know!!**I ended up spending the entire weekend in Damascus, VA when all my trail friends decided to zero on Sunday and talked me in to it (okay I already kind of wanted to stay haha). To save a bit of money I helped Woodchuck make and serve breakfast to the hostel guests Sunday morning which was actually a lot of fun. The hardest part about doing work for stay was that I had to be in the kitchen by 6am and had spent the following night at Damascus Brewery playing darts until 11pm. I spent my zero day spraying down clothing and gear with promitherine (for ticks), hanging out at Mojo's coffee shop and later relaxing next to and in the spring that runs through the town which was wonderful! For dinner we all ended up grilling burgers, eating bags of chips and pints of Ben and Jerry's ice cream.Day 38 on the trail, Monday April 25th, was a late start as I had to go to the public library to use the printer and then the post office to return my defective bladder. When I did hit the trail it was very hot and my pack was loaded down with 5 days of food and 2 liters of water weighing in at 39.5lbs so it was a rough morning. A bunch of us ended up camping by a spring and using dead trees to hang our bear bags (meaning multiple broken branches making for great hiker tv). Tuesday was a wonderful day! Halfway through the morning several older women showed up on the trail one of which was a triple crowner (hiked the AT, PCT and CDT) named Curly and they provided Pepsi and snacks. Soon after the Grayson Highlands began and man were the views amazing. One of the coolest parts was there were wild ponies and longhorn steers randomly roaming about. I ended up hiking to Old Orchard Shelter carrying 3 liters of water from the last shelter (5 miles out... Not fun) assuming I would stealth camp but when I heard what I thought was a bear I ended up pushing on.Wednesday ended up being another high mileage day when we all decided to get to Partnership Shelter where you can order pizza from the phone at the visitors center. Without planning it we hiked as a pack that day and in addition to Caboose and Sweeper who I'm used to leading (I am the ultimate pacer lol) at one point I also had Clementine, Bug Stick, Tweedy and Spidey... It was a lot of fun and very amusing to look behind and see the hiker train. After getting spots in the shelter we placed our order and I decided to man up and take a shower. I hadn't known it was possible to get a brain freeze from a shower but it is, even with taking breaks. The 23 miles and my feet feeling like they would fall off was all worth it when I got my own medium pan pizza with bacon, jalapeños, pepperoni and extra cheese which I washed down with Mountain Dew! Thursday morning I hiked with Caboose, Sweeper and Ginger Patch (a new friend) as we all planned on going in to Atkins, VA for lunch. An hour before the town we came across a school built in 1894 which is now a museum and has trail magic provided by a local church (ice cold soda again!!). After burgers at Barn Restaurant we pilfered the Sunoco gas station and got back on the trail around 3pm pushing on another 6 miles to a campsite. Friday was another hot day and while I passed multiple springs with hikers lounging about I made it until lunch time before finding a nice stream to soak my feet and eat at, it was magical. I hiked up the rest of the ""mountain"" leading up to Chestnut Knob Shelter which was concrete and super nice before continuing on to stealth camp along the ridges. Ginger Patch and Spidey camped with me and after dinner we all got comfortable in our tents leaving the vestibules open and talked to each other (super comfortable haha). Saturday was a rainy and uneventful day until we got to road US 52 and were given trail magic by Half Time (he thru-hiked the AT in 2011) and his family! I stayed at Helveys Mountain Shelter and shared it with 6 guys as we all wanted to stay dry with the approaching thunderstorm. The conversations were very random (including wishing the AT was like the Hunger Games and every night a cannon went off showing the pictures of all the fallen hikers) and one guy had to beat his tent (literally) to kill a bug rustling inside it. Sunday I was hiking over 3 miles an hour regardless of the rain and was motivated by making it to Trent's Grocery by lunch. However at the road turnoff a couple (Beth & Bernie) were parked providing sandwiches, snacks, drinks and best of all a hiker box with enough food to resupply until Pearisburg! Ended the day at the Wapiti Shelter (technically were two hikers were murdered in the past... Kind of creepy) for a total of 24 miles and I managed to beat the guys there, mission accomplished .Today I hiked in to Pearisburg, VA and am sharing a room at the fancy Holiday Lodge with a bunch of guys. We will head to the all you can eat Chinese food restaurant grocery store and eventually Mexican place for margaritas. After all great memories are made both on the trail and in town!","Damascus, VA

Food Bag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531972,"Tuesday (May 3rd) I woke up in our hotel room totally set on hitting the trail. After a healthy breakfast I got my things ready and headed to the post office to mail back some winter gear to my Mom. While the post office was open the ""hiker store"" didn't open until the 10am so I returned back to our room to wait. When I returned to the hiker store they only had awkward sized fuel canisters (too big for my pot) but I needed fuel so I purchased one and no Aquamira or better alternatives so I ended up buying a normal sized Sawyer to filter my water. By this time the thought of hiking 20 miles so late in the morning was not appealing and Learning Curve and I decided to just make it a zero day. The best part was returning to tell our ""bubble"" and they all decided to stay in town as well! The rest of the day was spent eating (2nd breakfast at Hardee's, a blizzard at DQ, late lunch buffet at Chinese and a whole rotisserie chicken from Food Lion for dinner), relaxing on the hotel patio with other hikers and playing Apples to Apples and watching tv... It was a very nice day . Wednesday morning was much more challenging to get up and moving but by 9am we hiked back down to the trail head and began our day. We hiked 19.5 miles to Pine Swamp Branch Shelter and fortunately the rain held off until hiker midnight (ie 9pm haha) when we were all in bed. Thursday I woke up to a cold, rainy day and did not want to get out of my sleeping bag. In fact I stayed in it for a solid hour after waking up and just talked to people from it as they packed up. It wasn't until Sweeper & Caboose left the shelter that I actually became productive. As I am a morning person I should have taken this as a sign. The second sign being 30 minutes later when a soaked man hikes to the shelter only to crawl in to his sleeping bag to get warm. I ignored the ""signs"" and began hiking at 9:30am while I was wet and the trail was either a stream or a mud pit it wasn't too bad... That is until 5 miles in when I reached a higher elevation and the rain slowed down and became sleet followed soon after by snow. It got to the point where I had trouble feeling basically everything but my core and had to keep going to stay warm and survive. I made it to War Spur Shelter by 2pm and after changing in to dry clothes got in to my sleeping bag where I stayed for over 4 hours trying to get warm. The rest of the day was spent eating and resting in the shelter.Friday was pretty uneventful but I will say the rain held off which was great since my clothing and shoes were still wet from the day before. Saturday was a new personal best (yes this keeps happening haha) as I hiked 24.7 miles from Niday Shelter to Catawba Mountain Shelter where I camped. The best way to describe the day is LONG, I hit the trail at 7am and wasn't done until after 6pm. I hiked over Brush Mountain and Cove Mountain (super challenging rock climbs similar to descending Blood Mountain) before getting to VA624 where North Stars (one of my thru-hiker friends taking a few zero days with his girlfriend) and Jane were waiting with trail magic! After pushing on another thru-hiker named Medicine Man who is taking a break from the trail as his dog recovers was giving out burgers and drinks at the parking lot leading to McAfee Knob. By the time I got to camp I was so full I just ate a snack and relaxed. Today I woke up at 4:30am in order to reach the top of McAfee Knob by sunrise. The view was spectacular and getting to experience the popular AT view before it got swamped with section and day hikers (who smell amazing by the way) was totally worth the early morning. Mismatch and I hiked up together so we could take plenty of pictures (check out my Instagram: noshingthrulife). Our second climb of the day was the Tinker Cliffs which were absolutely gorgeous. The trail literally has you hiking along the edge, fortunately the wind was blowing us away from or else I would have been terrified. We made it in to Daleville, VA by 2pm and now have clean laundry (not that is smells very good still). Next up is eating and going to Kroger's to resupply!","Pearisburg,VA

Food Bag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533371,"Day 52 on the trail (Monday, May 9th) started out great as I had a wonderful nights sleep in the hotel room and enjoyed the continental breakfast. After eating we went to the outfitter which thankfully was well stocked as I finally retired by Salomon Speedcross trail running shoes and replaced them with Salomon XA Pro 3D shoes. While I hung out in Shoe's room the rest of the morning Sea Biscuit, Sweeper and Caboose headed out. It was sad to see them go since for the first time I wasn't sure I'd see them again now that we have different agendas. While I'm still technically hiking solo the bonds you make with fellow hikers in your bubble (ie who hike similar mileage days and you've been around for a week or more) is quite special and I've hiked off and on with this trio since Hiawassee, GA which is a long time on the trail. I finally hiked out of town around 1pm and made it to Wilson Creek Shelter a few hours later. When I arrived El Tejano (a fellow Houstonian) greeted me and in addition to Spidey and Mismatch (who I already knew) a bunch of other hikers showed up (new friends haha). Tuesday morning was spent hiking in clouds which might sound cool but what it really means is low visibility and lots of moisture (ie I was drenched in sweat). Mismatch and I had lunch at Cove Mountain Shelter as we dried out our tents in the sun. The last push of the day was going up and over Fork Mountain before we arrived at Bryant Ridge Shelter. Holy crackers is it nice, the two story shelter fits 20 people, has a wrap around porch and a good spring for water right by the trail. The highlight for Wednesday was taking a bath in the stream at Matt's Creek Shelter. The water was quite cold but after sweating throughout the day it felt amazing to rinse off. I also had a big dinner: one ramen, 1/2 a pack of instant potatoes, tuna, twix and poptarts... I get so hungry after hiking 20+ miles. Thursday's goal was to get to Damascus, VA for Trail Days and my third and final hitch was by thru-hikers from 2005 named Fig and Just Visiting who took me from Daleville to Damascus (thank you so much!!). I spent the next few days taking in all the trail magic provided by Oneway Ministries, Four Pines Hostel and the town which included toiletries/resupply, food, laundry, showers, shuttle rides, etc... While being spoiled by these amazing and generous people I caught up with hikers I had met along my journey some of who I hadn't seen in over 4 weeks. At night we would enter the woods (literally) in tent city to drink and dance usually around a huge bonfire with a drum circle! Today I joined about 50 current or past thru-hikers as well as members of various trail maintenance crews to participate in the annual Hardcore trail maintenance event. We drove out to the scales in the Grayson Highlands and worked on adding steps either of boulders or logs. I have gained so much more appreciation for people who volunteer to maintain and upkeep the trail. We literally have to hike out the materials (sledgehammers, pickaxes, hammers, cuttermattocks, gravel, etc...) to build the trail and make it as navigable as possible for hikers. It was hard work but a lot of fun especially seeing hikers walk on the trail that I just helped make. Around 5pm we all came to Konnarock for the night and had a delicious bbq dinner and are now watching Pulp Fiction (on VHS haha).** By the way I type these paragraphs on my phone at night after journaling and I'm sure there are spelling and grammatical errors so I apologize. **","Daleville, VA

Food Bag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534322,"Monday (May 16th) was our second day of trail maintenance work and this time my group was putting in several big rock steps. After digging out places for the rocks we would get all hands on deck to use a rock net to carry the boulder to the hole. Then there would be lots of maneuvering to get it positioned just right before locking it in with gravel and dirt. We had run out of gravel the day before and had to make it by crushing rocks in to small pieces which took time and delayed the steps a bit. While there was a lot more teamwork involved that day and we had more breaks it was exhausting and by 4pm when we wrapped up everyone was ready to head back to camp to eat and rest. Dinner was salad, pasta and garlic bread with cookies and ice cream for dessert, we happily gobbled it down and went back for seconds and thirds haha. That night we watched Hook and Top Gun but I only made it to the volleyball scene (can't miss that ;p) before heading to bed. Tuesday I was given a ride back to the trail by Mad Hatter and Ma Buddha a couple who had drove down from Vermont to participate in Trail Days and Hardcore. He thru-hiked the AT in 2004 after their son did in 2003 and since then they've been very involved in long distance hiking. Before dropping me off they even stopped by the Shoney's in Daleville and paid for my breakfast buffet! I started hiking just before noon and while it was still drizzling the weather wasn't too bad. Two miles down the trail I ran in to Mishap and Blacksmith a couple I hadn't seen in at least 3 weeks so we hiked the rest of the way to Punchbowl Shelter together and caught up. My bubble was all still ahead but I met a bunch of new hikers including one named Bear Bag. Wednesday started and ended wet but at least most of the day was spent in a foggy, drizzle rather than a down pour. A side from a 2,500 foot climb the terrain was mainly small ups and downs so regardless of the crappy weather I ended up hiking 25.3 miles (new personal best!) to Seeley-Woodworth Shelter. I caught up to Trekkeroni who I hadn't seen since the Grayson Highlands and finally met Spongebob. The only bad part of the day was dropping my Sawyer (water filtration device) while trying to screw it back on to the water bottle and it falling straight on a rock and breaking in half (of course thus happens less than 3 weeks after getting a new one).Thursday marked my 2 month trail anniversary and man did I put my trail legs to work. After descending the Priest a mountain that goes from an elevation of 4063 to 970 feet I hiked to Harpers Creek Shelter for lunch. While eating two older men I'd blown past earlier showed up and as we talked I mentioned potentially going to the Devils Backbone Brewery I just had to get a ride. They said if I could get to Reeds Gap by 5pm they would give me a ride which meant I had 3 hours to hike 8 miles and go up and down Three Ridges Mountain. I accepted the challenge and took off and man was I exhausted when I finally reached the summit and then still had 4.3 miles to go. I arrived 5 minutes past (pretty great if I do say so myself haha) and as promised they took me to DB Brewery. I set up my tent and had dinner before heading to the pub where Spongebob joined me shortly after. It was so nice to have a beer to mark the occasion after all 842.5 miles in 2 months is a great achievement. Friday morning we lucked out and were able to hitch a ride quite easily from a hiker named Big Butt (thanks again for the ride and water). I was very motivated to get to Rockfish Gap and get a ride to the hostel as the sky looked quite ominous and the forecast was rain in the afternoon. I got to Paul C. Wolfe Shelter just before 1pm for lunch and met two Southbound thru-hikers named Snafu and Square Knot who were very nice. A girl named Trooper caught up to me and we ended up hiking the last 5 miles to the gap together and waiting for the shuttle. I felt so loved when I arrived to the hostel and Sea Biscuit, Spider Man and Sweeper all came out to say hello and give me hugs (Caboose was in the shower). I caught up to most of my little bubble! Our evening was even more special because Mr. & Mrs. Nail Gun, Moon Dog, Captain Ahab and Lieutenant Dan were all in town as well and we had a fun group dinner at a Chinese buffet. The hostel was packed at night and even though everyone was tired we stayed up and watched Vertical Limit a movie about climbing K2 that was very entertaining but super stressful. Today we decided to stay in town so we went to the movie theater to see the Jungle Book and it was wonderful to have popcorn, soda and take it easy. Hanging out the rest of the day at the hostel and will get in to Shenandoah National Park tomorrow, let's hope for good weather.","James River

Food Bag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535381,"We (Sweeper, Caboose and myself) entered Shenandoah National Park on Sunday May 22 and were out of it by Thursday May 26, solid 5 days of hiking if I do say so myself . The first two days the weather was quite cool and either drizzling or raining. While the weather wasn't great the terrain sure was, it was level with relatively few climbs which made it much easier for us to do big mile days. Especially when the sun finally came out on Tuesday drying up the mud and making us warm and mostly dry (until it became so hot we were drenched in sweat). We saw deers on day one but it wasn't until the fourth day that we finally saw bears. They were much smaller than we had imagined and looked quite cute but we still gave them plenty of space and admired them from afar. Although when we saw two bear cubs I really wanted to cuddle with them, they were so cute! We saw a fawn that was only a few days old and I was almost attacked by a grouse protecting her chicks near the trail.  Mice are quite common around camp and shelter sites but I've never seen so many as when eating dinner at Rock Spring Hut, good thing I tented. The park was very well maintained and had plenty of lookout spots to take in the rolling hills and green landscape. Since it gets so many visitors there are frequent campsites with picnic tables, trashcans, water pumps and restrooms (the comfort stations even had running water :O) which was a nice place for breaks. There are also Waysides which are gas stations with a gift store, small convenience store, restaurant and restrooms. We had dinner at Big Meadows Wayside and the food was just play but the blackberry milkshake was delicious. We hiked over 20 miles everyday except for Wednesday when one of my best friend's from back home who currently lives in Virginia picked us up and took us in to the nearby town of Luray, VA so that we could have lunch and resupply. We had Burger King for lunch but the highlight was the sundaes from Flotzie's Ice Cream. (Thanks again for coming to see me Marta, it was wonderful to catch up!) Well that was my SNP adventure and since then we have hiked another 23 miles to Ashby Gap where the lovely Mrs. Nail Gun (ie thru hiker wife and trail angel of the year) picked us up so that we could take a day off at her home and relax.","Waynesboro, VA

Today is Sweeper's birthday and while we celebrated with hot dogs, ice cream, burgers and beer yesterday we are heading to the bakery for some fresh goodies before hiking out.We crossed over the Mason Dixon line and are officially in the North. I have hiked more than half the Appalachian Trail and finally have less than 1,000 miles to go! I completed the half gallon ice cream challenge at the Pinegrove Grocery Store to ""celebrate"" as well as stick to tradition, 1hr and 11minutes later I was cold and sick of ice cream but done. We checked out the AT museum, found a place to camp and returned for burgers and fries (the hiker burger is phenomenal). Since then we have been hiking through Pennsylvania which as promised was extremely rocky and easily my least favorite state we have gone through so far. A couple days we got rain making it less humid but also causing a lot of mud and making the rock crossings even more challenging. We spent one night at the Doyle an old Budweiser hotel in Duncannon (an experience to say the least) and had a half day in Hamburg. We sprayed down our clothing with permitherin which I really hope works as I've found over 4 deer ticks on my legs in the last week.The biggest change I've noticed is that since Harpers Ferry the number of Northbound thru-hikers has significantly dropped. Whereas before I'd meet new people on a daily basis we pretty much all know each other by now and also know friends that have decided to stop hiking for one reason or another. While Nobo's are becoming sparse there are a ton of flip floppers, hikers who are beginning in Harpers Ferry or somewhere around the halfway point and hiking North until they reach Maine after which they'll go back to where they started and hike South. Also as expected the number of day and section hikers out for a few days of hiking has increased as well and will continue to as Summer arrives which should make things interesting (ie probably crowded and popular destinations). I'm really looking forward to the remaining states as I've never been further North than to New York and have heard there will be some gorgeous sites! Happy trails to my fellow hikers and to those reading at home enjoy the little things.","Delaware Water Gap, PA

Have come to develop new habits and behaviors that aren't exactly ""proper."" Here are a few examples:- Washing your underwear and socks in a public restroom and then tying them to your pack as you hike so they can hopefully dry off.- Taking a shower whenever you get the chance even when it is from a cold, exposed shower on the side of an ivy covered building that people drive by (thanks Falls Village, CT).- Making sure there is never any leftover food regardless if it is yours, a fellow hikers or even a strangers. Plus there is no rule for how long food can be on the floor, you just eat it. - Trying to wash all of your laundry leaving you to wear only rain gear or maybe even a towel for 1-2 hours.- When the church hiker hostel restroom has a line in the morning and you really have to pee so you go on the front lawn behind a tree.- When you use any item of clothing or material to dry off after a shower. Which for some means the same towel that they use to wipe dirt and condensation off of their tent in the morning.- When your feet hurt pretty much all the time so any break over 30 minutes means you get to take of your shoes which usually stinks up the place pretty bad.- When things like burping, farting, blowing snot rockets, etc... Become common place and you think nothing of them. Unless certain men are hiking in front of you and letting it rip constantly... Rude! - When you enter an establishment and the first thing you look for are outlets to charge your electronics. The examples above may seem horribly inappropriate and even gross but until you're out here hiking for several months you just can't understand.

Food Bag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540203,"Tuesday, June 14th we celebrated Sweeper's birthday by having breakfast at the Apple Pie Restaurant. An added bonus was a thru-hiker named Future Dad who we met the night before joining us. He has thru-hiked the PCT and is a very interesting and positive person, we like him lol. After breakfast we hiked out which meant almost immediately crossing over the Delaware River and entering New Jersey. Wednesday the heat really cranked up a notch and we shelter hopped for our snack and lunch breaks so that we had water and shade. Caboose accidentally dropped her toilet paper bag in to the privy hole which was gross but she did the right thing and got it out, not a great experience for her but funny for us.  Before ending our day at High Point Shelter we went down to the nearby beach and Ginger Patch and I went swimming which was so refreshing. Ginger Patch hiked ahead of us that night to meet up with his cousin in NY. Thursday we took it easy and hiked in to Unionville, NY to resupply and enjoy some deli sandwiches before continuing on a few miles to Pochuck Mountain Shelter. We packed out some beers and had a great time hanging out with our new friends Big Foot, Look Out, Spidey, El Auto and Chili Pepper. Friday morning we walked on the long boardwalk near Glenwood, NJ which for me was best part of the state! That afternoon we entered New York and were immediately welcomed by a crazed and potentially rabid raccoon followed by a lot of ridge walking. Our treat for the day was having ice cream at Bellvale Farms Creamy which was delicious. Saturday we had a rough morning hike with a steep descent to the road crossing NY17 where Jane (North Star's amazing girlfriend, thank you so much to both of you) picked us up and drove us 30 minutes to their neck of the woods so that we could get lunch (pizza by the slice!!), resupply and do laundry. The challenge was then getting back on the trail that evening with our heavy packs and going up a mountain (usually the case out of town) with obstacles like the lemon squeeze and a rock wall. Sunday was exhausting and overwhelming with people everywhere celebrating Father's Day. We hiked up Bear Mountain and had lunch at the top, descended the mountain and passed by a lake full of families relaxing and cooking, went through a zoo where the bear cage is the lowest point on the entire AT and then crossed over the Hudson River before finally hiking the last few miles to the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center where we camped. Monday we made it to RPH Shelter just after lunch and spent a few hours resting during the afternoon heat. Then we continued on a few miles to camp near a deli/pizza place off of NY52, we had pizza for dinner and fantastic breakfast sandwiches the next morning. Tuesday we lucked out and were treated to several trail magic experiences, first at Wiley Shelter by a thru-hiker named Super Hip and then from several coolers on the way to Ten Mile River Shelter. While setting up our tents near a group of Jewish camp counselors we randomly heard someone say Ginger Patch and there he was, he'd only hiked 4 miles that day with their group lol. **Shout out to anyone who put water by the road crossings in NY, it's been very hot and the water sources aren't reliable so we really appreciated it.**Wednesday morning was a rough start after eating a bite of a Hostess powdered donut that was not only expired but growing mold, yes that's apparently possible. The day got much better when we entered Connecticut and on the way to Silver Hill Campsite went for an afternoon swim. Thursday was an intense morning trying to make it to Falls Village to meet up with Ginger Patch's friend Alyssa. While he is the only one that made it by noon the rest of us got there soon after and we spent the rest of the afternoon drinking beer and eating cookies (thanks Alyssa, you're awesome!). We camped next to the Toymakers Cafe that evening and when heading to the woods to find a place to pee a family invited me in to their home to use their restroom and ended up giving me dessert which I enjoyed while telling them about the trail. Friday we had another lazy day and after enjoying breakfast at the cafe hiked to Salisbury, CT for lunch and to resupply. You know you're in the North when tortillas are in the International food aisle haha. We ended the day with a steep descent in to Massachusetts hitting 1500 miles and camping at Sages Ravine Campsite. Saturday Mismatch caught up to us at the top of Mount Everett and we all continued on to Tom Leonard Shelter where we met Secret Agent, Garfield and Stitch. My first and accurate analysis of the terrain in MA is that the trail can't seem to make up it's mind, even when a climb is evident they some how make it go down before bringing you back up... Not fun. Sunday the goal was to get to Upper Goose Pond Cabin as quickly as possible. We made it just before 4pm and it was already packed with hikers. Fortunately we got the last spots in the bunkhouse and had plenty of sunlight left to swim and enjoy the great view! We left the cabin early on Monday even though the caretakers were going to make pancakes so that we could avoid hiking too long in the heat and have time to hang out in Dalton, MA. It was a great decision as the ice cream shop Sweet Pea's and restaurant Jacob's were both quite good and we got there just as it started to rain. Tuesday was my biggest day yet, we had a marathon day and hiked 26.2 miles from Crystal Mountain Campsite to Seth Warner Shelter. Five miles in to the day we went to a nearby Dunkin Donuts and fueled up on caffeine and sugar before starting the climb up Mt. Greylock (the highest peak in MA). The climb went on for what seemed like ages but we reached the top just in time for lunch. The afternoon dragged on until the very end of MA when it kicked us out with a steep and rocky climb and in to Vermont.Today, June 29th, is my birthday and all our high mileage days helped us get to Bennington, VT in time to celebrate! We went to a local brewery for lunch, picked up dropbox/bday packages from the post office (thank you so much Maria, Sweeper's wife and Caboose's Mom, for the surprise whoopie pies and Maine inspired gifts!!), had a power 26 minute session (when you take a one ounce shot of beer every minute), went swimming, showered and did laundry (for the first time in over a week) and ended the day with pizza and a very jostled, chocolate cake (thanks Mom!). It was a great day and I am so lucky and thankful to have such wonderful friends to celebrate with.

Yesterday we made the group decision to take an impromptu zero and come in to the thriving metropolis of Andover, ME. While there isn't much to do here after completing the White Mountain National Forest and being welcomed by Maine with the most difficult (or fun depending on your viewpoint) mile of the AT a day of rest and food is what we need.After leaving Bennington, VT (July 1st) we hiked out about 15 miles to Kid Gore Shelter and decided to stay put to avoid the impending thunderstorm. When it did hit we quickly learned the shelter leaked and a boy hiking the Long Trail worked on setting up his tarp over it so that we could stay relatively dry. The next day Mismatch felt horrible which was apparent when he took an hour longer than the rest of us to get to the top of Stratton Mountain (fun fact this is where Benton MacKaye was inspired to propose the creation of the AT) and ended up staying at the shelter just after. Then the next morning Ginger Patch wasn't feeling well and I began to worry that we had all caught something, fortunately it was just a morning funk and he felt better later. We had heard the trail was near the annual Rainbow Gathering and when crossing the road to get to it a man walked past in sarong that came off shortly after and stayed off (Caboose and I giggled like school girls as it was so random and the look on Sweeper's face as he passed him was priceless). Ginger Patch and I tried to get a ride to the gathering but they had closed down the road and it wasn't worth hiking three miles off the trail to get to. On the 4th of July we treated ourselves to lunch at Q's Whistle Stop which was delicious but going up two back to back steep 500ft climbs after a sundae was a bad idea. We resupplied in Killington, VT (Mismatch caught back up with us) the following day and the best part was for the first time in at least 1,000 miles an outfitter was willing to exchange damaged Darn Tough socks for new ones, thanks Base Camp Outfitters! Throughout the trail Sweeper has struggled with shin splits and on July 6th they came back with a vengeance. While his new hiking boots may not have been the culprit they definitely weren't helping the situation. Ginger Patch came to the rescue and switched shoes with Sweeper for the afternoon, now that's a team player. Thursday, July 7th we crossed over the Connecticut River and entered New Hampshire starting with the town of Hanover where Dartmouth College is located. We left our packs in the Dartmouth Outing Club (not that we really blended in to the crowds without them) and headed to Ramuntos for lunch (they offer hikers a free slice of cheese pizza). We did laundry and took showers at the Richard W. Black Community Center and lucked out after when a trail angel named Ack drove us to an outfitter (Sweeper made the change to trail running shoes... About time haha) and the grocery store. It began raining soon after but we were dry and happy in the Salt Hill Pub which we hung out at way too late and had to hike in the dark to Velvet Rocks Shelter just out of town. This was everyone's first time night hiking, excluding Mismatch, and it proved to be a slow process when going over slippery rocks and after a few beers, crazy I know. Friday was a rough morning mainly because we all seemed to have two left feet and kept falling. The day became much better when we got to the recently deceased home of trail angel Bill Ackerly who would give hikers water, ice cream and a place to relax and even play croquet. At least for now his family is keeping the tradition going and letting hikers continue to stop by which is so sweet. I'm not exactly sure when we entered the White Mountains but on Sunday we climbed up Mt. Moosilauke and were over 4,000 feet for the first time since the Priest. That evening we all got spots in the Eliza Brook Shelter and managed to stay dry throughout the night as it poured. It wasn't raining the next morning but we started the day with a stream crossing that required us to be in ankle deep water and the trail was literally a river in various sections, so much fun. Thankfully we went in to North Woodstock, NH that day and stayed at the Autumn Breeze (a nice and inexpensive motel) so we got to wash our wet and muddy clothing. Tuesday was a clear, sunny day and when climbing up Mt. Lafayette l understood why so many people raved about the Whites. As soon as we hit the ridge and were above tree line the views were spectacular! We had a snack at Lonesome Lake Hut (there are 8 huts in the Whites and we visited all but Greenleaf Hut since it was a mile off the trail), lunch at the top of Mt. Lafayette and made our way to Garfield Ridge Shelter and Campsite the first of many sites in the Whites that charge $10 per night to stay at (which is really expensive in my opinion for tenting). Wednesday the big climb of the day was South Twin Mountain, we had lunch at Zealand Falls Hut and scored some leftover lasagna (the hut crew provides dinner and breakfast for guests and when there is leftover food they will often offer it to thru-hikers) before meeting Ginger Patch's Sobo doppelgänger named Honest Abe. The section of trail from the hut to Ethan Pond Campsite was the easiest part of the Whites and I enjoyed every minute of it. Thursday was a rough start as I hadn't drank enough water the night before and while going up Mt. Webster was pouring sweat, dizzy and lethargic. I had to take multiple breaks and ended up drinking all 2 liters of my water by 11am, fortunately I felt much better after the water and a snack. At Mizpah Hut we devoured free pork and a beef/mushroom concoction before booking it to Lakes of the Clouds Hut as the weather forecast called for rain, strong winds and potentially hail. Even though we got there quite early we were able to get a work for stay option for all five of us. In exchange for some labor, I helped clean up the mess hall and washed dishes after dinner, we got to sleep on the dining room floor (rather than the dungeon a small, dark, cold room on the outside of the hut with dilapidated bunks) and eat the dinner and breakfast leftovers after the guests. It was a great deal and we enjoyed watching the crew entertain the guests, the hardest part was watching and smelling the food being served and having to wait until they were all finished before we could eat. As forecasted it rained throughout the late afternoon but cleared up just in time for a gorgeous sunset. With full bellies the next day we climbed the remaining mile up to the summit of Mt. Washington (at 6,288ft it is the second highest point on the AT) and were rewarded with a view of... Fog as far as the eye can see haha. While we didn't get a good view it was still cool to be at the top and get tossed around a bit due to the intense wind (I almost lost my ATM hat =O). Descending was a pain in the butt as it was essentially a rock scramble with no defined paths and required a lot of concentration. At Pinkham Notch a ""friend"" ended up bailing on me and we had to hitch rides to get in to Gorham, NH and around town (a fellow Nobo named Rain came to our rescue and took us to our motel from Walmart, thanks man) making it a very late night trying to get all our errands accomplished. After breakfast I hitched a ride for us back to the notch from a New Yorker named John, me being directionally challenged however neglected to tell him to turn South on 16 and we ended up driving several miles in to Maine before we realized we had gone the wrong way, he was very nice about the detour though and just turned right around. That weekend was the annual ""Seak the Peak"" event and there were hundreds of day hikers going up Mt. Washington, thank goodness we avoided those crowds and instead got to climb up the Wildcat Mountain peaks (insert sarcastic tone here as they were freaking steep). We did get to watch a small wedding ceremony at the top of one of the mountains which was cool before having a late lunch at Carter Notch Hut (the final hut in the Whites and the most quaint). Sunday we had had lunch at White Mountains Lodge & Hostel where I got hooked up with a free pint of Ben & Jerry's from a staff member named Guardian thanks to our mutual friend Bill Nye. We stayed at Gentian Pond Shelter and ran in to two new Nobo's (which doesn't happen often lately as we either know them already or people are Sobo's by this point) named Tesla and Johnnhy Rocket. Monday morning, July 18th we finally hit Maine and man was it a slap in the face with Goose Eye Mountain followed by Mahoosuc Notch. Just imagine a mile of boulders that require you to go up, down, in between and under them to get to the other side and the varying heights mean the temperature is constantly fluctuating in places as much as 20 degrees farenheit. We weren't exactly speed demons before that section but that mile took us a bit over 2 hours for our entire group to get through and then we still had the lovely arm to go up. By the time we reached Speck Pond Campsite it was about 7:30pm and we were exhausted. The next day Sweeper's left knee which had started bothering him in the Whites was super inflamed and red. That paired with our general low moral after the beating of the last few days is what brought us to Andover and it sure was a great decision I had a wonderful nights sleep last night and am thoroughly enjoying our lazy morning so far. Sorry for the long entry I just had a lot to catch up on and finally the time, opportunity (thanks Caboose for lending me your IPad) to type something up. My phone stopped working at the top of Mt. Washington (probably due to all the humidity) and I have no idea when I'll be in a place with a Sprint store so that I can get a new one. Hope you all enjoyed the update and please send well wishes and prayers our way as we make our way North, we are coming for you Katadhin!!","Andover, ME

Food Bag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545139,"On Sunday August 7th, 2016 the Pizza Bubble completed our Northbound thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail!! We waited for some of Sweeper's friends from back home to join us and started our final hike up Katahdin around 7:15am. I was excited and nervous to be so close to the end and very eager to get the show on the road. Regardless of our varying hiking speeds we all waited within sight of the summit for the entire group to arrive before going all the way to the top. I wasn't as emotional as I'd expected but simply could not stop smiling from feeling so happy and relieved to finally be done. However, watching Sweeper and Caboose touch the sign together and him begin to cry after accomplishing this amazing feat which he had been hoping to do for the last 40 years was something I'll never forget. After taking our group shots we celebrated at the top with a toast of sodas and snacks. We hung out for about an hour and then all got antsy to descend and be back on flat ground with hiking behind us (at least for now). I put away my trekking poles as they were no use and flew down the mountain and was rewarded by being the first to arrive to the little welcome party of Sweeper and Caboose's family and friends at the bottom. It's now been two days since we finished and it honestly still hasn't hit me that we are really done. Granted it doesn't help that the five of us are all still together hanging out in Maine at Sweeper and Caboose's home. I'm sure in a few more days when we aren't having to pack up our gear and get dropped of at the trail head and worse we will have to say goodbye to each other is when it will sink in. I'd like to be able to conclude this entry with some sort of epiphany about life or maybe even just what my next move will be but unfortunately that is not going to happen. I can say that hiking the Appalachian Trail is one of the best decisions I have ever made and definitely the most challenging both physically and mentally to complete. I am so grateful to have not had any serious injuries or illnesses along the way, thanks for all the well wishes and prayers . The trail was absolutely gorgeous and I saw more natural beauty the last few months than I have in my entire life but what made my thru-hike was the people. I met so many amazing people and made friendships that I hope to keep in the many years to come. So thank you to anyone and everyone I met along the way and especially to Sweeper, Caboose (my trail bestie), Ginger Patch and Mismatch the other members of the Pizza Bubble and my trail family!P.S.Eventually I will post another entry with my hiking figures/stats as well as a gear review.",,Katahdin,"Aug 09, Tue",5.10
Food Bag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547929,"When planning any long distance hike the right gear is crucial. Based on your budged try to purchase the best quality gear you can get as it will make a difference. Below I have listed most of my gear by the item, the technical item name and the brand followed by a quick review. If you have any specific questions please shoot me an email. Tent                     Copper Spur UL 2                               Big Agnes Loved my tent!! Many hikers had the newer Fly Creek tents however having two vestibules made getting in and out much more convenient and was better for ventilation. Tent footprint            Copper Spur UL 2 Footprint                     Big Agnes Expensive and a little small, better off saving money and making your own with Tyvek sheet or another material. Backpack            Crown VC 60 Ki Pack - Women's              Granite Gear Great, minimalist pack, very light weight and having a top loading bag makes you efficient at packing and usually carry less unnecessary things. Super jealous the new ones will have a hip belt and a brain.  Sleeping Bag            Sawtooth 15°F/-9°C Long-LZ Down(650 Fill) MarmotGood, kept me warm and compacted to a very small size. Sleeping Pad            Insulated Air Core (Long, Rectangular)   Big Agnes Do NOT get this pad, I replaced it once before hiking and the new one started leaking air one month before I finished hiking (sleeping on hard ground was horrible). Many other hikers I met had similar issues and while it is comfortable when it works the quality just isn't there for long term usage. Sleeping Bag Liner   100% Premium Silk Sleeping Bag Liner    Sea to SummitIt kept me warmer, served as a good blanket when the nights were too hot to sleep in my bag and I was able to wash it along with my clothing so it kept my bag cleaner. Dry Stuff Sack            Event Compression Dry Sack               Sea to SummitEssential when you have a down sleeping bag. Pillow                     Ultra-light Air-Core Pillow              Cocoon I started out just using my clothing bag and would wake up with puffy eyes that looked like I was just punched. Having your head properly elevated at night is much better and this pillow allowed me to remove the inflatable bit so that I could wash the cover with my clothing. Hiking Shoes            Speedcross 3 CS Trail - Running Shoes    SalomonSalomon is an amazing brand with a superb return policy, thank you!! I ended up wearing three pairs the entire hike, the first for 727.5 miles, the second for 883.5 miles and the third to Katahdin at 578 miles. I did try one pair of XA Pro 3D Salomon's and was not a fan as the Speedcross had better tread and grip. Camp Shoes            Ultra II Ladies                              VivobarefootExpensive, light weight, full foot coverage and much better looking (in my opinion) than Crocs so I was happy with them. Trekking Poles            Trail Pro Shock Trekking Poles               Black DiamondNot a fan, mine turned in to poker sticks about half way in. Other hikers with Leki poles seemed to fair much better. Water Filtration    Mini Water Filtration System              SawyerI started with both the Sawyer Mini and Aquarmira chemical drops. Definitely get the full size Sawyer as it filters much faster and the Aquarmira is good for a back up or if you want to double filter but unnecessary. Stove                     Gigapower Stove - Auto                     SnowpeakGood for it's price but slow, if you can afford it get a Jetboil. Cooking Pot            Titanium Trek700                              SnowpeakGood size (I could fit two ramen packets or one ramen packet with a knorr pasta side just barely) overall and quality.Bear Bag            S29 AllWhite Bear Bag                     UrsackWonderful bear bag! It is very tough and would carry about 6 days of food. The only down side is it is expensive and not water proof so make sure to put the food in ziplocs or other bags inside (I used the lopsak bags seen below). Food storage bags    OPSAK Odor-Proof Barrier Bags 21"" x 12"" LopsakThey seal to make them odor proof doesn't last long, good size and I used them then entire trip to keep my food dry inside of the bear bag by simply rolling the top to seal it.                 2 - Underwear            Sport Mesh Hipkini                              ExofficioComfortable and great for swimming. Underwear            Lacy Black Bikini                              ExofficioNot as comfortable but it was nice to have one pair of ""pretty"" underwear. 2 - Sports Bras      Classic Dri-Fit                         NikeBuff                     Coolmax UV                                      Buff Great for a snot rag, sweat band or to sleep in (it kept my dirty hair out of my face). Rain Jacket            Minimalist Rain Jacket                     MarmotThe gore-tex aspect kept me warm and the pit zip help for ventilation. It is a bit heavy and in warmer weather you get hot very fast. Rain Pant            Regen Rain Pant                              ColumbiaWorked well but I did not use them often and mailed them back in Virginia. Fleece                     Fleece 1/4 Zip                              REIGreat extra layer for cold weather. Mailed back in Virginia and just kept the puffy. Puff Jacket            Nano Puff Jacket                              PatagoniaNice outer layer, kept it the entire time. Long sleeve shirt    NTS 250 Pattern Crew Top - LSH              SmartWool Great shirt to sleep in for cold weather. Mailed back in Virginia and replaced with a cotton shirt.Long sleeve shirt    Midweight Space Dye LS                     REIGood for cold weather or when the weather was unpredictable to have an extra layer on top of my t-shirt. T-shirt                     NTS 195 Tee - Women's                     SmartWoolWonderful shirt, very comfortable the only problem was mice liked it too and when hanging overnight in a shelter they got in to it and put holes everywhere. I ended up getting rid of it and replacing it with a quick dry athletic shirt, mostly due to budget or else I would have got another one. Gloves                     Switchback Gloves                              REII never used the thick, bulky outside but only the small inner glove linings which I mailed back in Virginia. Beanie                     NTS 250 Pattern Cuffed Beanie              SmartWoolEssential to keep your head warm and this beanie worked great, I'd recommend keeping one the entire trip as the weather can be unpredictable. Sleeping Pants            Mid 250 Bottoms                              SmartWoolVery comfortable and good quality, I wore them the entire time!Pants                     Stretch Zion Convertible Pants - Men's  prAnaExpensive but great hiking pants the only problem was I lost weight and they became so loose that even with a belt they were uncomfortable to wear. I ditched them in Vermont to get rid of the weight. Shorts                                                              NikeI found some awesome running shorts at a thrift store in Virginia and wore them almost every day when my pants became too big. I wish I had two pairs!3 - Socks            Socks Micro Crew Cushion (Boot Cut)      DarnToughIt is ideal to have two pairs for hiking and one for sleeping. It's not very easy to get them replaced on the trail but you will find them in most outfitters and they are good socks.",,"Houston, TX","Sep 06, Tue",0
