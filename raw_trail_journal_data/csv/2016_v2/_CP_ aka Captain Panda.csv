The rest of the day involved much climbing (almost 4000 ft) and descending 
(2517 ft). A brutal day! Because we got a late start, we had to stealth camp 
along a creek just short of Congdon Shelter as it was getting dark. 
Very lucky to be still living the dream!!!

climb 4400 ft including a steep 700 ft climb at the end of the hike.
Arriving at the inviting Goddard Shelter, all of the tent sites were 
taken and the shelter full, so more hiking ensued. I was totally 
exhausted and beginning to experience some pretty serious back
and shoulder pain. Shared dinner with Strider and went to bed.
Hopefully I will feel better tomorrow. Trying to live the dream!

The worst was the last two miles when I had to stop every 
few minutes to relieve the pain. If this continues, my 
hike may be over. I stumbled into the shelter white as a 
ghost and immediately layed down to rest. Strider set up my tent
and shared his dinner with me. Tomorrow I will try to get a ride into 
Manchester Center and see a doctor. Barely living the dream!

weekenders from NJ gave me a ride to town. Because 
it was Saturday, my options to seek help was limited
in this small town. I checked into one of the nicest hostels
on the trail in Green Mt House and rested all day. Had a 
filling dinner at a tavern dating back to 1790. Manchester 
Center is a beautiful and prosperous little town, but the nearest
ER or urgent care is 30 mi away in Rutland VT, and no way to 
get there on the weekend. Monday morning I will try to see someone,
either here or in Rutland. Living the dream!

in case I continue. Since there is a full kitchen at the hostel,
I went to Shaw's and bought steaks and baking potatoes for
Strider and I. Strider, who continued on over Stratton Mt yesterday
arrived in town about 2:30. The hostel is overflowing tonight. Hong Kong
Steve is here, and is a practitioner of Chinese massage and worked on 
my back which I hope helps. Living the dream!

I immediately knew that I had sustained some structural damage, and initially thought that the collarbone was broken. However, it was likely a partial separation that went back in place; but the pain was severe and required me to carry my pack with only the right strap. Luckily, I was only 1 mile from the road. Went to the ER at Rutland Regional Med Center where they did nothing but waste my time. Cowboy camped on the deck of the Yellow Deli in Rutland, which was fun. Tomorrow I am headed home to be evaluated, since I cannot continue the hike in this condition. My goal is to get treatment, recover and then meet Strider at Rockfish Gap in about 5 weeks to start our flop to Springer. I'll finish NH & ME at a later time. Trying to live the dream!!

I will resume my hike after injuring my shoulder coming down Killington Peak in 2016. That was a Flip Flop which started at Rockfish Gap. This time I'm going to start in GA,; walk to Rockfish Gap, and jump ahead to Rutland. Looking forward to joining the class of 2018. I learned so much about gear needs, unnecessary items, pack weight, resupply, mileage, etc that it should be a lot smoother and more enjoyable this time around.
