Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520368,"Hello to everyone. I suppose I better work at figuring how to use the journal since there are some people who told me that they will ""walk with me"" through any writing that I do. March 19, 2016. That is when there is only one way to go and that is north. I will do my best to convey what I am experiencing and any encouragement will surely be helpful. A wonderful, frightful and great adventure is ahead of me. The wind of spring blows northward and I seek to follow.   Windseeker",,View Entry,"Jan 28, Thu",0
Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520510,"Today, I woke up at my normal time with no alarm and realized that i had no where to go. I retired from my job this past Friday and it is strange not to be going in after all these years. I have been planning for this day and what should be my great adventure for some time, but now that it is near, it will take some getting use to. I have had many friends say that they want to follow me as I travel and I sure hope that my writings will express some of what my fellow hikers and I will be experiencing. I have traveled this trail many times through the writings of other hikers and now it is my time. Travel with me if you wish and experience the good days and those that may not be so good. I guess I could be at work!The wind of spring blows northward and I seek to follow. Windseeker",,The waiting game,"Feb 01, Mon",0
Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520680,I spent a lot of yesterday going thru all the gear that I have acquired over the years and trying to thin it down to what I actually plan on starting with. I will need a new pack and a number of other stuff sacks. Then it will be time to thin out my pack again. Just over five weeks until I leave Dayton to see what the future will bring. I look forward to it and I am also concerned about what am I getting myself into. Am I up to the adventure. Time will tell.The wind of spring blows northward and I seek to follow,,another day getting ready,"Feb 04, Thu",0
Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520983,"It has been a little while since I have wrote anything, but I don,t believe it is important to be on here telling you about my non trail days. Over the last week I have been picking up more (new) gear and doing a lot of work around my home. Since I retired eleven days ago, it has giving me a chance to sort thru and eliminate a lot of clutter that I have generated during my life and start to organize the next phase of it. I am also happy to say that I am getting to spend more time with my wife and grandchildren. Soon I won,t being seeing them very often if things go the way they are planned. My oldest grand daughter who is nine has even been going hiking with me and at times carrying a pack. She is going by the name of Starchild right now and I hope it can carry on to the trail at another time. We have managed to hike 18 miles in our two times out with more trips to come. As for gear, I have picked up a new pack, a Deuter Act Lite 65+10. It is pretty comfortable and I am trying to figure out how to pack everything in their place. I picked up several dry/stuff sacks which are proving to be most helpful. It's an off and on thing right now. A couple days on the house and then a couple days trail prepping and then a couple hiking. No matter how much I get done, I don't believe I will think it is enough. When the time comes, I will just put on the pack and start north. The rest will work itself out. Until next time.",,Cold Day,"Feb 11, Thu",0
Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521789,"It has been two weeks since I wrote anything on here and I'm sorry that I let other things keep me away. As the old saying goes, "" anything that can go wrong, will go wrong"". The good thing though is that my plans and start of the hike has not changed. Since writing last on the eleventh, my wife,a daughter and two granddaughters were in a car wreck that totaled out our primary vehicle and thankfully only caused minor injuries to everyone. It was not their fault, someone ran into the back of them. During the police investigation of the accident we found out that my daughter had a detain for court hold on her from an old traffic violation. They took her ""downtown"" without ever having her medical issues looked at. We spent all night and part of the next day locating where the violation was from, driving five hundred miles round trip to get her released and a new court date. Her new court date from a 2013 traffic ticket was on the 18th of February and we had to re-drive the five hundred miles again. After around $1500 had been spent, she is now free and clear of all her past offenses. Hope she doesn't get another ticket ever. In the meantime, everyone has been checked out from their injuries and are recovering well. We have been dealing with our car insurance issues during all of this and we are now looking for another vehicle. It is not exactly the way that I planned my retirement to start but even with all these obstacles, we are moving on with plans as scheduled. I have even found time to buy more equipment and do a few short hikes. Two of my daughters and I have planned on doing a three day, two night, 32 mile hike on the Laurel Highlands Trail in Pennsylvania as a send off for me. I really look forward to spending the time with them and hope that we will be able to do more of it in the future. Everything is coming together but I will need to work on what I'm packing for the hike because when I weighed my pack yesterday with more items to be added, it was 33 pounds without food or water. I know some of that is winter gear that will change as it warms up. I have carried heavy packs before(50 pounds and heavier)and it was not fun. I wouldn't want to do it too long. I believe this is enough for today so I will let you go and go pack some more. See you on the trail.",,View Entry,"Feb 25, Thu",0

I have been packing and repacking and trying to get the pack 35 lbs with food & water. Not sure I will reach it at this time. My daughters and I leave Saturday for a pre-hike trip in Pennsylvania which looks like rain everyday for our 30 miles. My apprehension grows as the date approaches but my children seem very enthusiastic. I have been meeting with friends and saying my goodbyes for now and receiving well wishes. At church, they even did a special blessing for my feet and legs. Take all the good will I can get. It sure is starting to become real after these years of planning. I will talk to you all later.

Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523978,"I spent a half hour a little while ago entering a long journal and it seems that the server lost it all. In a few hours I will be getting out of my vehicle and watch it drive away. It is a frightening thought since then I am fairly well committed to moving up the trail. My ride won't be back in the area for a few weeks. My pack weight is around 40 pounds with food and water and I keep trying to figure out how to make it lighter. Earlier this week I did a prep hike of 27 miles in the mountains of western Pennsylvania with two of my daughters. I really do appreciate that Kristeena and Stacy would do this with me. It was their first backpacking experience and the weather was fairly cooperative. It was difficult on all of us and makes me question what am I doing? I have a lot of family and friends who plan on following me and who are encourageing me on the journey ahead. I don't want to let any of us down. As long as my mind and body are willing, I will move onward. Who is ever really prepared? One foot in front of the other and down the trail I go. I want to climb that big mountain in Maine again and this is the only way I will do it.",,View Entry,"Mar 19, Sat",0
Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524203,Yesterday I was dropped off at springer mountain parking lot and after a climb to the top I started north. That was just after noon. The trails were real nice but I believe that is because of high local use for fishing and camping. The weather was nice and warm most of the time.   The area is beautiful and the people real friendly. I made it to Hawk Mountain about four thirty and called it a day.   I headed out this morning around nine and I make good time on level ground or going downhill.   To bad there are so many ups.   The biggest climbs today were over sassafras mountain and it's buddy Justin mountain. They really slow me down to a near crawl. Made to this shelter area around three and decided to go ahead and call it a day. Put up the tent and good thing. Probably thirty more people showed up. I have taken some nice pictures but I am having trouble getting them on the site. When I figure it out you will be able to see some things. As for tonight it is supposed to get down to 19 degrees and snow. It was sleeting earlier. I'm putting on the warm cloths now. Wish you were her.    Later,"New Hawk Campsites

Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524332,Woke up to about an inch of snow. Quite chilly also. Packed up and hit the trail at 8:30. It was nice hiking to hooch gap and for the third time there was trail magic. Continued on to woods gap and there was more trail magic. It was just after noon and I ate a lot . The climb up out of the gap to preacher rock was very difficult for me. The views were awesome. From there it was mostly down hill for a couple miles until I reached the campsite. Tomorrow I have to climb over Blood Mountain and I'm not sure how far i will make. I'm slower than I expected. I may lose my hiking partner. Hope not. Later,"Gooch Mountain Shelter

Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524498,"Today was a long day starting out at 7:45. Hiked the first five miles by noon and climbed the biggest mountain so far. Blood Mountain was over 4500 feet tall and really took some effort to reach the top but the views were unbelievable. Blue sky and you could see maybe 100 miles in all directions. After that it was a hard downhill to Neels Gap and Mountain Crossing hostel and store. I had thought about staying there but was encouraged to go on by my ""partner "". I headed out by 3:00 pm for the next six miles and mostly it was not bad. The last 3/4mile was a real hard climb and when I got to the place to meet, she was not there. It was already 7:00 so I set up camp for the night. There is one other guy here as well. I will try for 12 miles tomorrow. Talk later","Lance Creek Campsite 8

Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524622,"It has been a good day. Sunny all the time. Even to hot for me at different times of the day. I left this morning at 8:15, had to stop and filter some water before I could go far. The trail was nice and I did pretty good for several hours. Every time you turned around there was something else to stop and look at. My legs are sore and getting stronger but I am having a hard time going up the climbs. I have a hard time getting my breath and have to stop about every hundred feet just to catch my breath. The last few miles today I wasn't sure if I would make it to the shelter area and have to just camp in the woods somewhere. I really enjoy the view and the people that I am camping around. After five days in the woods, I reserved a hotel room for tomorrow to clean up myself and my cloths both of which are in great need of a washing. I will see how I feel after a day off the trail. I ran into a friend of mine hiking southbound today and it was such a surprise. We talked for awhile before he headed on. He hopes to make it to Springer Mountain by Friday evening. He travels fast and far each day. Gave me his number if I need a ride. Friday will be a decision day for me. See you later","WhitleyGap ShelterTrail

Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524761,"I did a short mile day and after six days on the trail both my clothes and I were getting a little rank. It was time for a town visit and a night in a room . I had to get to the pickup location before my ride showed up and left with out me. It was mostly down hill but in these mountains that doesn't mean that it was easy. I made it down in an hour and ended up waiting nearly another hour for him to arrive. It was all good. Some people were dropped off and I climbed into the van with others headed for town. I was the first to check in and after putting my things in my room I headed straight for the subway next door. It didn't take me long to devour a foot long sub, three cookies,two bags of chips and a drink. Surprisingly I wasn't full.   I am having a hard time with my right ankle and I can only go short distances uphill before I have to stop and catch my breath. I was seriously considering stopping today.. After much thinking and planning, I have decided to go shorter distances each day for the next week and make it to Franklin North Carolina where I do believe that I will leave the trail. It is beautiful out in the mountains and i have met some interesting people. I am not nearly in shape enough for this hike and have totally enjoyed my experience. I will keep writing and trying to get my pictures on here better until I leave and I will go spend a week in and around the Smokies. I don't know I could get back on the trail again later for a time. I will leave with no regrets and be proud of what I have done. Do not feel bad for me. See you tomorrow night as long as I have service.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524834,"Today was a very short day. I did have to climb over two mountains today up around 1000 feet and down.1000 feel. That was Rockie Mountain and then right up Tray Mountain which was about 1400 foot climb. They were not that bad and I reached the shelter area around two today. My camp is all setup for the night so it is a little boring just sitting here. I have a reservation at the North Georgia Hostel on Sunday and it is only like 11 or 12 miles away and I cant get in early so I have to do short days. I may try to go all the way tomorrow and look for a tent site. The views have been great as usual. I believe I was able to get more pictures up as well. Until tomorrow, thanks for all your comments,even from a dissatisfied reader. What ever happened to hike your own hike? In 20 years I will still look back with pride of all the things I have already accomplished before ever coming to the trail and all that I will do on the trail whether 100 miles or 1000 miles or all the way. I have already climbed Mount Washington and Mount Katahdin. It would be nice to do it again but I am ok with what ever happens.","Hiawasie Georgia / Unicoi Gap

I really don't think it's getting any dryer at the moment. Maybe the sun will come out before it's time to pack up and leave. Oh well. Just go back from town and an all you can eat buffet. I did my normal damage. There is a scale here and if I believe them,then I have lost between five and ten pounds in the last week. Tomorrow the climbs will take us above four thousand feet to stay for awhile and up over the first five thousand foot mountain into North Carolina and my coming back down hill into Franklin NC where I will be picked up on Saturday by someone I know headed for Gatlinburg.

I have covered quite a distance in the past 36 hours and I have climbed over Standing Indian Mountain at almost 5500 feet elevation and now am on Albert Mountain at nearly 5250 feet elevation with an old fire tower on top for an even better view. It has been a great experience and I hope the pictures are showing some of what I have seen. I will try to write more later this evening at the shelter if I have service. Until then.

Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525664,"After the climb and pictures on Mount Albert of which I believe I forgot to take pictures of the climb itself,( picture a climb of 60 to 70 degrees or steeper for a mere 400 feet up with a 40 pound pack on your back) and you will get an idea of the accomplishment. After this we were rewarded with the next 2&1/2 miles as a nearly level old road bed and trail to end our day. The shelter is known as the Long Branch Shelter and was only built in 2012. It has a real nice upstairs and a downstairs that could hold up to 16 hikers if you were okay with close neighbors. I usually stay in my tent. Last night I only put out my tarp and the rain fly over it. I thought it would help get me on the trail earlier than usual for the 3& /2 miles to the pickup location for town. It did when I headed out at 07:00 AM this morning but I ended up almost an hour early. I found out that 6 others had left even earlier. Needless to say, we were all happy to see Ron Haven's shuttle bus arrive and picked us all up for the 13 mile ride to town. I was a little lucky and a room became available after most other hikers had headed for another place to stay. Franklin is a spread out town with lots to check out. I cleaned myself up and it started raining and what do hikers do but go walking around town in the rain. First I found a Kountry Kitchen for a Reubin sandwich, onion rings and two tall glasses of sweet tea and I walked less than a block and found a sports bar. I had to go in and now have hot wings and two tall glasses of draft beer. Now feeling pretty good I proceeded to walk all over town in the rain. I was not alone in this. I was running into other hikers all over the place. Now I am back in my dry room settling down for the evening. Until tomorrow","Long Branch Shelter area

Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526027,This is the day I get picked up and taken to the Smokey Mountains for a week of relaxation. After that I will decide whether I hit the trail again even though I probably won't any time soon. It was hard to watch the other hiking friends of mine head out and I am not with them. Even though it has only been two weeks it seems as if I had known them much longer and I will miss them. Maybe we will meet again up the trail. I thing I was happy to do was run into a trail legend who is in town for a week he says. Baltimore Jack who has done the whole trail 7 years in a row and 1 more time over two years. He knows the trail. I will try to write more another day. My ride will be here in a couple hours and down the road I go.,"Franklin, North Carolina

Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526305,"I will not lie , I really am feeling depressed about being off the trail. Seeing my friends get on the shuttle and heading back to continue their hike while I hobble around town is a hard thing to do. I am now 1 day behind some and 2 days behind others. That amounts to anywhere from 10 to 25 miles. That is quite a bit and getting larger every day. My ankle was a problem when I started and it has gotten worse. I was hoping it would work itself out while hiking but that has not happened. For those who may not know, I had half of my right knee joint replaced about four years ago after tearing it up on the trail for the third time leaving nothing else the doctor could do. He told me then to quit hiking but especially backpacking. He said that I should start riding a bike instead. I told him that I don't believe that I can do that because of the plans that I have. I have backpacked a couple hundred miles since then and hundreds of regular miles as well. The first week out here I slipped in some mud coming down a short hill snapping my right knee backwards causing sharp pains in what had been the good part of my right leg. It along with my ankle is little too much at this time for me to hike with and so I will take some more time off the trail. I was picked up by my wife Rose and now I am soaking my legs and everything else in a whirl pool hot tub. I met some other hikers at Newfound Gap who had started on March 6 & 7 and spent some time with them talking the same talk which helped my mood for a short period. I wish to be out there in the snow and cold with my new friends as strange as that may sound. I will enjoy where I am for now but I look to the mountains and long to be there","Franklin, North Carolina

Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526955,"First off I noticed that my total miles are way off. I left the trail due to ankle and knee issues at Rock Gap North Carolina after 106 miles on the trail. I will try to see how to correct the adding up of miles on my sight. I have been taking it fairly easy the last week and I have been going over my pack to make some changes. I miss the trail everyday and as we have been traveling in the area this past week, I have ran into quite a few of the fellow hikers i had been hiking with. Some are off the trail completely due to knee and ankle problems, others have lost their hiking partners due to injuries, and others are now hiking into the smokey mountains which are covered in snow and very low temperatures. As bad as it is out there now, I wish I was with them. If all goes as ""I am planning"",then I hope to be back on the trail in the next ten days. My knee and ankle has given me little problem in the last several days and I will be back home by Tuesday the 12th to try and see my doctor about them. If all is good there, then back to the woods for me. I wish I was in charge of all things that I want to do but for those who believe in a higher power like I do, then you know I do not have the final say in what I do with my life. Maybe another plan has yet to be shown to me. Until then, I will move forward with what I have planned myself.","Sevierville, TN

Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528092,"For anyone still following what I may write, I have made it home on Tuesday the 12th and to the doctors on Wednesday the 13th. I had x-rays of my ankle and knee and the results of that are that my ankle is all still in good shape except for arthritis which we will just have to deal with. On the other hand, my knee has some kind of mass in it now and I have been scheduled to go to my orthopedic doctor on April 26. I keep asking everyone, isn't there any time sooner. I really want to get back on the trail and try to accomplish at least some more distance this year but things are kind of out of my control at the moment. It has been hard for me the last couple weeks since getting off the trail and it seems so much longer. My friends from the trail are already near 100 to 150 miles ahead of me.

Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530214,"For those of you who occasionally still check up on me, I finally had my visit with my orthopedic surgeons who happily told me that I had not damaged or caused to come lose the artificial part of my right knee. The other issue of the mass in my knee joint that was seen on the x-rays caused them little concern as well. It may be a little water but nothing to worry about. One of them told me I was fine to get back out and hit the trail again with the normal aches and pains of someone my age,(now I feel old), and the other doctor said I should ride a bike instead. Does that me a motorcycle or something else? Anyway, I will now put myself and my gear back together and should be heading back to North Carolina by the end of next week. I sure have missed being out on the trail. It is hard to explain how quickly the people and the woods just get into your soul. When you leave, it's like you have left part of you out there. It is not easy at all to hike all day with 30 or 40+ pounds on your back worrying about what you are going to eat and where you will get your next drink. I thought I was ready but reality shot me down quick. Now I will go put myself through it again but at least this time I do know what I am getting into. Will I be out there this time for a week, two weeks, a month or all the way.   I have made peace with myself over this and what ever happens I am okay with. If I stop somewhere again and come off the trail, I will just plan on restarting at that spot again next year. It is hike your own hike and enjoy what you can partake of, not worry about what others might think or be disappointed in what I accomplish. Every step I take on the trail is gift to me that will be with me forever. I hope that I can provide some of you a little idea of the beauty that is every foot of the trail and maybe someday it will be you writing the journal and me following your words. Until then","Home

Wind Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532077,"After being off the trail for six weeks to let my knee and ankle recover and things on the home front improve, we made it back to Franklin North Carolina yesterday. This morning I went back to Rock Gap to start where I got off and slack packed over to Winding Stair Gap where my wife Rose was waiting to take us back to the hotel. It was tough going up hill as it always seems to be but once there on near level trail it was an awesome but short day. When I finished the hike today and made it back to our vehicle we found out that the starter was not working. We have had quite a bit of problems with this vehicle since we got it and now more are arriving. The bolts came loose on the starter and I had to jack it up, crawl under and tighten them up. It would seem after Aamco replaced the transmission, they didn't secure the bolts tight enough on the starter. It is working now but not like it should and I am worried that it may not make it home with out more problems. I could not let my wife and daughter attempt this on their own. So with heavy heart I have decided to end my attempt at a thru hike at this time with hope of returning to the trail at a later date somewhere further north.

I held out hope that my circumstances at home would change but they were too great to allow me back on the trail this year. It saddens me so but April 2017 is not that far away. I was able to do 110 miles total between my first time out and my second time where I had to leave again. I learned a great deal about the trail and met some amazing people along the way. I am still following several people on trail journals who I had the pleasure of hiking and spending time with. I also had the opportunity to sit down and spend time with Baltimore Jack for a couple hours a few days before he passed away. These memories will always be mine and God willing I will make new memories next year. Thank you to the people who did read my writing and who encouraged me along the way.
