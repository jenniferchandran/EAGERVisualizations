Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526512,"I have been reading books on the Appalachian Trail (AT) for about five years now. After much contemplation and thoroughly discussing this dream with my wife, I have decided to attempt a thru-hike of this very historic trail. Approximately six weeks ago I decided to attempt this bucket list dream of mine. In this short amount of time I purchased all of my gear, since I had none to speak of. I researched what equipment to carry, how much weight my backpack should way, the best way to purify water, what type of food to eat and how much food to carry in between resupplies. In addition, the type of clothes to wear and exactly what to bring with me. More to follow on these subjects. I personally invite anyone with an interest in the outdoors to follow me on this approximately 2,200 mile, 14 state journey that will lead me through the Appalachian Mountains from the most southern terminus in Georgia to the most northern terminus in Maine by way of flip-flopping from Harpers Ferry, WV.",,View Entry,"Apr 05, Tue",0
Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526648,"Just a quick update to let you know what I am doing for preparation and training. Since I started the process of hiking the AT I started walking, walking and walking some more. In the past six weeks I have hiked over 240 logged miles. I have alternated with my 30 pound pack on the walks and some without. I started my training hikes in southern Florida (flat, swampy terrain) and have been in the lovely rolling hills in southern Ohio for the past two weeks. I have to say I like the rolling terrain much better for this type of AT training. As far as shake down tests occur. Other that setting up my equipment, trying my clothes on, and thoroughly reading I am all set, I think. Still need to buy my food though.For backwoods experience I spent 20 years in the US Army in the Infantry as a Ranger. I will count this experience for my backpacking multi-day trips. Even though I have been out of the Army for 12 years I have never abandoned the outdoor type activities. Hiking is a deep passion of mine and it is the most amazing peace and quiet in the world. Thankfully, my wife loves these outdoor activities as well. A shout out to my number one supporter. ""Thank you Tonya""",,View Entry,"Apr 06, Wed",0
Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526762,"Some of you may be wondering why I am not going to hike the AT in the traditional way from Georgia to Maine. Upon much research, I think ""flip-flopping"" is the best way for me to hike this approximately 2,200 mile journey. Starting in the southern terminus of Georgia is where the majority of hikers start their journey. Thus creating the term, ""hiker bubble."" I don't particularly want to start with a lot of people. Not that I am anti-social, I just prefer a more solo experience. Another great aspect of flip-flopping is a hiker reduces the impact on trail erosion and leaves less of a human footprint on the trail itself. I just prefer to practice the ""Leave No Trace"" principles as much as I can and in my mind this may help. Last but not least is that I learned of the 2d Annual Flip Flop Festival that will be taking place in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia on April 16th and 17th. The folks at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy have organized this two-day event to try to encourage more flip floppers for the same reasons mentioned above. The festival will have informative talks, a movie of the AT, and other events as well. Did I mention FOOD? Additionally, some previous experienced thru hikers will be helping us newbies with a shakedown of gear. A shakedown consists of the difference of what I think I need on the trail versus what I actually need. Bottom line, they are there to give advice to lighten the pack weight to better the odds of me completing the entire journey.Thank you to all my friends and family for just smiling at me when I say I am going to attempt to hike the Appalachian Trail. I know inside you are shaking your head, but I just shake my head too.",,View Entry,"Apr 07, Thu",0
Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526935,"Today when I woke up it was a little chilly. There was ice on the outside of our RV steps and it was barely above freezing. I guess I'd better get used to this type of weather because I know the elements can be uncooperative at times.Last night I decided to scrutinize and pack by 50 liter backpack 100% as I would be hiking the trail. My wife and I went on an eight mile walk so I could see how my body would handle the extra ten pounds. I have to admit my body felt the added five days worth of groceries in my pack. Five days of food equals about ten pounds of additional weight. On a happy note, we are going to an all you can eat seafood buffet with my brother and his wife so I can simulate hiker hunger as well.  More to follow on how well I handled those extremely large crab legs.",,View Entry,"Apr 08, Fri",0
Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527107,"Last nights event at the seafood buffet was awesome. I guess those of you who don't know an AYCE is an ""All You Can Eat."" I ate some of the biggest crab legs I have ever ate. Not to mention some tasty fried shrimp, prime rib, veggies, and too many desserts to count. I figure with me walking a minimum of about 8 miles a day now, why not eat like there's no tomorrow. As good as any excuse right? I woke up this morning in lovely southern Ohio at approximately 4:30 a.m. to a loud strange noise. My mind was telling me a snow plow was moving along the major road near us. I disregarded my thoughts and went back to sleep. Once I finally got up at 7:00 a.m. I looked out the window of our RV to you guessed it. SNOW!!!!!!   Just a dusting, but the wind was relentless.So I did what every dedicated pre-hiker would do. I threw on my hiker pants, socks, shoes, shirt, and a slight more upper body gear and started my morning routine. I managed a little over seven miles despite the 20 something degree temperature. What I learned in my Army years is that as long as you are moving, you will stay fairly warm. It still held true to this day. The hot chocolate upon my arrival back home was delicious.I did some thinking of my current hiker gear and am going to make a couple of changes today. I am going to take my bulky Columbia jacket out of my backpack along with my Frogg Toggs Ultra Light rain jacket. I am going to go with my lighter fleece Columbia jacket and use my Gore-Tex PacLite Shell rain jacket as well. I think the lighter fleece will be much easier to layer for me. And my Gore-Tex jacket is thicker and I will use as a windbreaker/rain jacket. Until next time.",,View Entry,"Apr 09, Sat",0
Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527361,"I have scrutinized my backpack so many times over the last couple of weeks. It is amazing just how few items you have for a thru-hike, but have too much stuff to carry for a thru-hike. Does this make sense? I didn't think so. Today was basically my last day to get my backpack packed. I was so concerned that my pack would weigh over 30 pounds with all my food and gear. I was pleasantly surprised that my total weight is only 27.5 pounds. I am including five days worth of food and almost 2 liters of water. I think the extra large bag of peanut M&Ms may have been a bit much. But I will count that as my protein supplement. After much online research, I think 30 pounds or less is the idea weight. I am happy with my gear selections.Next weekend during the 2d Annual Flip-Flop Festival (Harpers Ferry, WV) there will be a few 2000+ mile hikers that will be giving courtesy shakedowns. This will help us 2016 thru-hikers for a more successful hike. I definitely plan on stopping at one of those experienced hikers' booths so they can go through my pack. I am all ears for great advice on shedding weight. If I can shake a pound or two from their experience I will be extremely happy.I plan on having pictures soon of some of my gear selections so you all can see.Until next time!",,View Entry,"Apr 10, Sun",0
Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527491,"WOW!!! Only one week from today and I will be finally attempting my thru-hike. Am I excited? Am I a little anxious? Will I miss my wife? Yes, Yes, and Yes. Not to mention I will miss my other close family members.
These are just a few questions that are in my head as these final seven days approach. And I know they will be coming upon me quickly. However, I am ready and I am looking forward to hitting the trail. 
Hiking this trail is just something inside of me that says, ""I have to do this."" There are quite a number of people that just cannot understand exactly why I want to attempt this for six months. There are even more people that have no desire to live like a wild man for that period of time. To anyone who wonders, I just have to, need to, and want to. It's a bucket list thing that is high on my priority list.
And hey, I actually do like hiking and being outdoors. I enjoy cold weather. I don't mind the rain, and my greatest peace is when I am in the woods. I have read that hiking is cheaper than therapy. I really, really hope I can get my money's worth of approximately 2200 miles. 
Until next time, and feel free to sign my guest book. Thank you.",,View Entry,"Apr 11, Mon",0
Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527647,"FINALLY, the weather here in Ohio is starting to break. The sun was out, the temperature was around 50 degrees, and spring is in the air. I woke up to the wonderful sound of songbirds this morning. All, this in our lovely capital of Columbus. I can only imagine just how much more the birds will be singing and just how much prettier spring will be when deep on the trail. My wife and I went on a hike this morning. Our goal was to walk seven miles to just keep my legs loosened up. We managed to walk ten miles with no problems at all. I am thinking it is because I did not have my 27.5 pound backpack on. I managed to leave my pack at my brothers and sister in laws house for a couple of days while I took care of pre-hike business. I felt lost without my Osprey pack, because it feels like a big part of my hiking routine already. With only a week away it should be.In the Army we would always give ourselves a countdown prior to a major event such as graduating from Basic Training, completing Ranger School or coming home from a major deployment just to name a few. Since I will be starting my thru hike this upcoming Monday I will give the countdown of five days and a wakeup. Because when I wake up, my lovely-supportive wife will be dropping me off at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy so I can start my flip-flop journey.",,View Entry,"Apr 12, Tue",0
Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528024,"This is where I stand as far as my preparedness for my Flip-Flop thru-hike. My start date for my hike will be this Monday the 18th of April. To my knowledge, I have all my gear and it is all packed up and ready to be loaded in our car tonight. With the numerous courtesy shakedowns at the festival this weekend, I am sure I may have to tweak my gear a little. Or maybe not.We are planning on leaving tomorrow morning at 5:00 a.m. (Saturday) from Ohio and drive approximately 7 hours to Harpers Ferry, WV. My wife and I will be attending the festival on both Saturday and Sunday to be further educated on the trail, watch an AT movie, and hike a little. We also plan on eating some good ole festival food as well. Nothing like a giant funnel cake to satisfied sugar cravings.The festival is having an all you can eat (AYCE) breakfast Sunday morning prior to some of this year's Flip-Flopper's departing for their thru-hike. I think the festival will be a great time and I am very thankful to be attending this event.I cannot thank my family enough for putting up with my crazy ideas. After two months of constantly talking about it and showing all my gear, I think they are somewhat less apprehensive for me. For those of you that are still not sure, just wait till you see my nature and wildlife pictures. To include my journaling throughout this thru-hike. I hope that will help you better understand. My countdown now is two days and a wake up. Just a few days away until my long journey begins. When you get time, give me a shout out on my Guest Book. I not only want, but will need your words of encouragement. When things will maybe get a little tough on the hike, I will be able to think of your positive words. Thank you....",,View Entry,"Apr 15, Fri",0
Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528431,"Well this is it.   One more night and a wake up. This is my test email using my cell phone to update my journal.   The Flip-Flop Festival was a great success. I learned a few tricks on packing my backpack. The shakedown from a prior hiker named Judo helped me shed about two pounds of weight. It doesn't sound like much, but over a 2000 mile hike that weight adds up.   Thank you Judo for your expertise.This morning my wife and I went to the kick off for other thru hikers. At 9:00 a.m. ten hikers departed. We talked to them and encouraged the hikers as well. To Eight Thirty, my goal is to catch you in three days.   LOLI will miss my family and friends. You all be safe and I will see you all later. A big ""thank you "" to my wife for not only bringing me here, but by all your support.   I will see you in about six weeks.",,View Entry,"Apr 17, Sun",0
Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528782,"Yesterday was my big day! I started my thru hike of the AT.   It seems so surreal being out here.   Yesterday I started hiking around 10 a.m. My wife and I stopped at the ATC to make my hike official. I got my picture taken by Laurie at the ATC. My wife got some great and funny pictures too. Yesterday, my goal was to walk eight to ten miles. I ended up doing 16 miles yesterday.   My body felt it. Ouch.Today, I paced myself better and hiked only 11 miles.   Much easier than yesterday, but I can still feel it. I have aches. LOLThe weather is extremely cooperative and will be until Friday as far as I know. It has been sunny and warm both days. I brought about 2.5 liters of water containers.   I am glad I did because I am drinking the springs dry in the mountains. I will try to upload some pics too. So please go to the pics tab to view.To date I have seen 4 snakes, one deer, and a lot of turtles and squirrels.   No black bears yet. I do hang my food bag just in case one comes around camp. You all be safe.","Harpers Ferry, WV

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528988,"Today was a 15 mile day. I really needed to get to Waynesboro, PA to make a few gear adjustments and to do a quick resupply. Let's talk gear issues first. I had a non breathable Columbia boonie hat. GONE!!! It was not letting my head breathe and causing me to get too overheated. I replaced it with a 100% polyester ballcap. One of my hiking poles kept getting shorter as I walked.   Is all I had to do was tighten a screw. FIXED!!! Last thing was my extremely hot underwear.   Little did a know they were designed for extreme cold temperatures. IN TRASH CAN!!! I am thankful a Dollar General store was only a few blocks away. I hope all is good now. I will be back on the trail and out of the motel first thing after breakfast.   I have to take advantage of good food. LOL. The weather is still awesome and the trail is amazing. I see a lot of high view points that are stunning.","Harpers Ferry, WV

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529410,"Since Waynesboro, PA the weather has chaneed a little. It is not as humid and a little cooler. It has been lightly raining and makes the hike more pleasant. It rained all night last night but my tent passed the test. I should have tested it prior to departing but opted not too.I met up with many flip floppers the last few days. It was nice catching up to Eight Thirty. Happy Trails to you.   My small gear changes turned out great. The breathable ball cap and among other items are for the better.I am sitting outside the Pine Grove General Store and just got my food. Man this burger is awesome. Huge!!!! I am opting out of the traditional half gallon ice cream challenge. Too hungry for real food.Embrace the moments out here. Its challenging, stinky and totally worth it so far. Until next time.","Harpers Ferry, WV

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529475,Today was a 20 mile day for me. I can feel it. Aches are everywhere.   But it does feel good.   I walked through the Rock Maze today here in Pennsylvania.   It was an enjoyable time but I was glad to get through it.   At times I had to put my hiking poles down to utilize my hands. I've walked approximately 40 miles the last two days and another 20 tomorrow. I am exhausted and going to bed. PS- This mountain water taste so good.,"Harpers Ferry, WV

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529648,"Woke up this morning to low 30 temperatures. It was too cold to use my cat food alcohol stove so I packed up at left around 7:15 a.m. It was my coldest night yet. I woke up around 1:00 a.m. cold so I wrapped my feet with my Gortex jacket and utilized my silk Cocoon liner for 9.7 degrees added warmth. Back to sleep I went. Yes, I spelled stile correctly. Stiles are wooden steps that let you cross farm field fences to prevent damage. (See pic) Before crossing I looked in the field for any type of dung patties.   I looked for cow dung specifically.   I made sure no bulls were on the other side of the fence waiting for the next poor, tired hiker. I was successful both crossings. No bull today. My third 19 plus mile day today. Too much for week one, my knee is telling me to ease up the miles. I will be listening tomorrow. I have completed 113.8 miles with my first week complete. When I get to town I will update my miles on here.Until then, happy trails ya'll.","Harpers Ferry, WV

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529818,"Pennsylvania is known in the AT hiking world as Rocksylvania. I now know why. I hiked about six miles on them at a less than 2 mph pace.   My reward, a swollen knee and blisters on both feet. I never get blisters, but I did today. I hiked into Ducannon, PA this afternoon to get caught up on a food resupply and to wash clothes.   Not to mention I ate twice. Hiker hunger is starting to kick in.Duncannon is a small rural town. I am staying at the world famous Doyle Hotel. It is over 100 years old but has catered to hikers for many years.   Each floor has one bathroom that all tenants share. It hasn't been a problem because only about 8 hikers are here and among two floors.   You just have to stay here once so you can pass the story down generations.

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530697,"I haven't logged in for a while because I have had poor phone reception since my last log in. Mountains and cell service don't go well together.   First I'd like to talk about trail angels. They are great people that show up just when you need them. Take section hiker Larry for instance.   Larry not only is an avid hiker, he also likes shuttling other hikers around as well. He was so nice to take me to the grocery store and a pharmacy as well.Another trail angel named Mary was at a road intersection with fruit, vegetables, chips, humus, gallons of water, and cold drinks. And one more thank you to the nice man and woman that gave me a lift to Walmart in Hamburg. Many thanks to you all. I very much appreciated the kindness of you all. Now let's talk trekking poles. If it wasn't for this great invention I would not even be on the trail.   These poles have kept me from falling onto the ground too many times to count.   They are great for assisting tired knees going down hill and you can push off them when going up a hill. I simply can't hike without them.I still have blisters and they are ever so painful.   I have them on my toes and the back of my heels. Not to mention bruised feet bottoms from the jagged rocks. I hope my feet toughen up real soon.I have had issues with my right knee for about 11 days now. I fell like I am walking through this problem.   I may have brought this onto myself for walking too many miles the first week.On a happier thought.   I am almost 200 miles into this journey in only two weeks.   It is exciting to see the wildlife. I did hear a bear the other day.   It wanted no part of me and he went crashing down the mountain in an ungraceful way. I like it when bears move off the trail. Unlike the grizzly bear last year in Alaska that forced my wife and I to change our direction.My next major town is five days away. I hope to have better reception over this course.   Until then, happy trails","Harpers Ferry, WV

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531044,"It's been two days since I last gave an update. First off, Hamburg, PA is a nice small town with the largest Cabelas in the world.   It was humongous.   I decided to retire my cat food can stove and by a MSR stove instead. This lightweight stove heats up water so much quicker. This little stove is awesome.A Nero is almost like not walking any miles at all. A Nero us a near zero.   After leaving Hamburg I walked only five miles so I could rest up my right knee.   It feels better than last week for sure. The last two days has been slightly raining and a lot of mist. There has been so much mist in the air that I have stayed damp just by hiking through it. It beats the heat and I don't mind the coolness.   Rain+Moss=Slick rocks. Today's rocks were were brutal on the feet and knees. I slipped on the large boulders twice and did two nice side plants. Just another reminder to slow down in slippery terrain A buddy of mine fell two days ago coming down some rocks and ended up with 15 stitches near his eye.

I injured my knee 12 days ago and thought I would be able to fully recover while hiking. It is not the long miles, the up hill ascents, nor the flat lands. It is going down hill that has been causing my knee great pain.In summary, I have walked 250 miles in 16 days which put me about 15.5 miles a day. My third day into the hike I injured my right knee. I tried to shake it off, but my knee just isn't recuperating.I will be following some of you on here as the days go by. My wife and I plan on being in Massachusetts in the very near future for the summer. When you make it to MA, you will have two really nice trail angels awaiting you.
