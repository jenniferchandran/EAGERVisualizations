Broken Knee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479414,"So I have decided to hike the AT in 2016 shortly after I turn 65 years old. Why? Because when you have big problems you need big goals. I hope that my journey will help others that have suffered life altering injuries and that in-turn I will be inspired by them.Bad Luck.I have always been an active person. I have done some hiking and quite a lot of cycling. In May of 2012 I was in Florida on business and was taking a bike ride on the West Orange trail in central Florida. At the time I was in reasonably good shape and could handle 50-70 mile rides pretty comfortably. I got cut off by another cyclist and had a small fall, the kind anyone who has ridden bicycles very much has had more than one of. This was the kind of fall that you might skin your knee or hands, but typically you would just get back on and ride off. That didn't quite happen in my case. My knee (Tibia Plateau technically) exploded. I was taken to a local hospital and I had a CAT scan and when I asked about the results I was told that ""Humpty Dumpty comes to mind"", it was broken in more than 50 pieces. I addition I had some sort of shoulder injury which they could not assess immediately.It was quite clear that the hospital I was at was in no way equipped to handle this. I had my scans sent to a senior orthopedic trauma surgeon that I knew in Boston. He later told me that it was as bad as he had seen in 30+ years. If you have been at something for 30 years and what you are looking at is as bad as you have seen, things are not good. He figured there were maybe 5-6 surgeons in the country that could deal with it. Good LuckFortunately for me, one of them from the Mayo Clinic had just come to Orlando and my doctor knew a top knee guy in Boston that knew him. I understand that medical triage would dictate that those most in need would see the best, but all in all, it is better to know someone. A day later I was on my way to Orlando Regional. 25 days later and three operations later I was on a medical jet heading to Boston were I was sent to Spalding Rehabilitation Hospital (I believed ranked #2 in the US) for several weeks before returning to my home outside the Boston area. The last operation implanted 16 inches of titanium plating and 15 titanium screws in my leg. An earlier operation had put my shoulder back together with titanium washers and wire. I spent 42 days in the hospital.That was almost three years ago and while my doctor confessed to me that after seeing the CAT scans he never thought that I would walk again, I am walking. Not very well, I need a cane to walk more than a 100 yards (hey the AT is only about 3.7 million yards long) and even with that I can only make about 2 miles total at this time. I can only walk on dead flat surfaces (the AT is flat right?). Fortunately my first goal was simple, just walk any distance.I have come to the next phase which will happen on January 8th, when I will have all the titanium removed from my knee (the titanium in the shoulder will be there until the end of me). Maybe I can have it made in into a cook pot, or better yet, since it is a much higher grade than used for pots, maybe it can help someone else with a TPF (Tibia Plateau Fracture).I started walking at Logan Airport in Boston using a walker with my son walking behind me with the wheel chair, two years ago. I was totally non-weight bearing for 6 months. I plan to end walking the AT less than 2 years from now.Once I have the metal out and that has healed I will have a total knee replacement. My knees were perfect before the accident, but right now my Tibia Plateau has the profile of the Rocky Mountains, it should be smooth as glass. With every break and every screw bone dies and the dead bone caves in causing craters on the surface.So in short I can walk with a cane for 2 miles and that was my first goal, now I need a bigger one and I have always wanted to do the AT so that is it. I will start reporting my progress after Jan 8th and it will not be in miles, it will be in steps. I'm 6'2"" and normally have about a 3 foot gate, so I need to get from where I am to about 5 million steps. Should be a piece of cake. Accidents and Inspiration lead you to your destination.

Broken Knee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479436,"I have hiked on the AT one other time. It was just a weekend affair about 10 years ago. I hiked from some road in Vermont south to Williamstown MA, about 25 miles. It had rained for 3 straight weeks before I left and was cold, only in the 50's. I think it was the last week of June or the first of July. The day I started out it was sunny and 95 degrees. The first day was a 15 mile slog through mud and over rocks. The rocks were a lot better, the mud tried to suck your boots right off your feet. I was hiking in with long pants and a long sleeve shirt and I had bug repellent on my face but I figured I didn't need it on my arms unless I saw mosquitoes trying to get through my shirt. Did not give a thought to black flies, too far south and already summer. Didn't see an either. After I arrived at the campsite and started to setup my hammock I suddenly noticed that both my arms were swollen and had started to bleed in several places. I had zero idea of what was happening. I could not see any bites of any kind. An hour later two women hiked in and I thought maybe they knew more than I did, they couldnâ€™t know any less. So I showed them my arm and asked what they thought. They turned out to be two nurses from Montreal out for a weekend hike and they knew right away. The black flies had had a feast on me.I never once saw them or felt them biting me right through the sleeves of my shirt.I have been in the Everglades with mosquitoes so thick that you could not breath except for the mosquito netting, but I think I prefer them to black flies, at least they are an enemy that you can see. When I got back home I put some cortisone cream on. When the swelling went down I had at least 50 bites. NEVER trust black flies, they are nasty little devils. If you are in New England protect your self until you are sure there are none and carry some cortisone cream just in case.Accidents and Inspiration lead you to your destination.

Broken Knee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479438,"I have zero hiking gear. I did so much business down in Florida that I kept an apartment down there. In the winter especially, I kept all my hiking and cycling gear down there. I left on a bike ride the day of my accident and never returned. After I was med-flighted out my son closed the apartment and put everything in storage. I did not get back down there for a year and I could only take back what would fit in the minivan besides myself, my wife and my son. I never thought I would hike again so I donated all my gear to charity.That is fine with me, I'm sure everything is much improved today and I'm technical (computer programmer) so I like going over specs and evaluating things. Everything will be new and I have more than a year to evaluate and choose my gear.Accidents and Inspiration lead you to your destination.(MCC)",,No Gear,"Dec 27, Sat",0
Broken Knee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479481,"I'm thinking about hardware today (doesn't every hiker?). Not boots and backpacks (which incidentally is the title of a book I really enjoyed.) or even stoves. I can make a mistake on any of those and just throw it out and buy another; this morning I'm thinking about knees. I need a new one and in the next two months or so I need to decide which is best for me. Unfortunately there are no returns, not that I could afford a second one.First there are the now traditional off-the-self titanium knees. They have been around more than 30 years and are pretty well understood. They have a failure rate of about 15% which is measured by how many patients are dissatisfied. But who knows what that means? And who knows how the failures are distributed among doctors. Are there hacks that have a 30% failure rate while really good doctors have a 5% failure rate?Then there is a new technology on the block. 3D printed knees, where a 3D scan is taken of your knee and a custom printed one is made. They even custom print the installation tools. First of all printing in titanium is pretty weird and the technology is just turning 3 years old, so obviously there are no 20 year studies. The one company that does it (ConforMIS) does not publish a failure rate for its knees. Strangely it lists the failure rate for all the major traditional knees in its brochure. I don't know what good that information is without knowing what their failure rate is.It is like, ""Here are all the weights of our competitors' backpacks and boy are they heavy. How much does ours weight? Sorry we can't tell you that, it is top secret.""You would think you could just ask a couple of doctors what the best option is, but I did that and being a skeptic I also checked on the doctors. And guess what? The doctors who recommended it had an interest in it (like holding patents that are assigned to ConforMIS) and the ones who didn't have different interests.A little investigation showed that since the government pulled out of financing medical research (which triggered the so-called ""Stent Wars"" among makers of heart stents) the medical system has been a pit of conflicts of interest. Every Tom, Dick and Harry owns patents on something.As someone who makes their living from technology I'm inclined to be on the cutting edge. I mean the older knees come in typically 5-6 sizes and they basically hack your leg apart to make one fit. Doesn't a custom printed one seem like a much better idea? And the funny way the company spells their name with MIS at the end; that stands for Minimally Invasive Surgery. Doesn't that sound better? The upside if it works is enormous, it might dramatically improve your chances of doing something like the AT.But the company has a law suit against it. A couple (at least) of its knees failed down in Texas and they are blaming the surgeon. If you were building a multi-billion dollar company on new technology would you blame the surgeon you sold to and you trained or would you just fly the patients to the best surgeon for your product and just fix it?There is no question in my mind that in 5-10 years when you need any new bone it will be custom printed, but it is not 5 years from now and if you are going to be the guinea pig, you sure want to know the company is standing behind you, not looking to shift blame to someplace else if something goes wrong. I mean there are no long term studies, so you are already taking a significant risk.If some company tells me boy you have to use our new pack, we haven't completely tested it but we are sure it is great. I might bite if it looks good, but the company better stand behind it if it fails for ANY reason.And if the American medical system is going to have all these conflicts of interest, shouldn't they make it easy for the public to do their own due diligence? I'm going back to the surgeon in Boston who designed most of the 3D knee and is supposedly the best at that surgery and I want to know the failure rate, both in general and his. Everything made by man has a failure rate.What can I say, equipment choices are always difficult.",,Thinking about gear,"Dec 28, Sun",0
Broken Knee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479633,"Hey, it is 2015! Happy New Year to all you AT dreamers and doers. Good luck to the class of 2015, your time on deck is almost over. It is only 15 degrees here in Massachusetts so I'm going to guess no one is crazy enough to start today at Katahdin, but I know at least one is planning on hitting the trail at Springer. He is going to see a lot of winter storms.A week from now I will be under the knife. It is my new weight loss program. I'm starting with the removal of a bunch of titanium plates and screws in my leg. Hopefully they are not still holding my leg together! I have been doing at least 4,000 steps a day for the past couple of weeks (don't tell my doctor, I don't want to listen to him), but in 8 days I will be back to zero.  I will be partial weight bearing for about 6 weeks, which is a lot better than the 6 months of non-weight bearing I went through after my accident. When you can finally use your leg, you can't. It is like an astronaut coming back from 6 months in space, you bones have decalcified and they will bend like rubber. You have introduce them to weight very slowly or you will break them. On the other hand it was great for my right leg.  I have played Bocce ball on one leg at Spalding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston. My therapist was beating me until I made him play on one leg, not so easy that way. Actually he was great, I was a mess when I flew up from Orlando and he fixed me up. Great guy. I was also non-weight bearing on my left shoulder so I was hopping around on a one handed walker and one leg. I had a leg broken in 50 places, 2 titanium plates, 13 titanium screws and a complete rebuild of my left shoulder A/C joint (held together with two washers and wire) and I might have been the best patient at Spalding at least on my floor. More than half the people in the gym there were missing legs or arms. The guy in the next room had no face, was blind and had no ears; he was caught in a fire. It puts your problems in perspective very quickly. It is not a place for therapists who really are not into it and it is not a place for patients who are not into it. You have to have vigorous therapy for at least 3 hours a day. If you can't do it then you can't stay. On the other hand you know you have the best doctors and therapists taking care of you. Like the AT it is very much a community. All the victims of the Boston bombing went there, so if you are ever really in desperate shape, find a way to get there.Once I have rehabbed from my surgery next week and my bones are strong enough, then I will have a total knee replacement and hopefully that will be my last rehab. Then I will be getting ready for the trail.Signing off for now, but once again good luck to all the 2015 AT hikers!",,Happy New Year,"Jan 01, Thu",0
Broken Knee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479667,"6,000 steps today (about 3+ miles), admittedly in climate controlled flat environment (an airport), but if I can do that everyday for 2.2 years without a day off I would be done. Or I guess my other option is to build up to a lot further. Well for now steps are the order of the day, but I hope to start measuring in miles soon.A lot of talk in books and journals about putting up with blisters but not a lot about prevention. I think it was ""Left Turn"" that mentioned basically greasing your feet with Vaseline. It is the friction not the rubbing that kills you, so that makes sense to me. In my younger basketball playing days we always wore 2 sets of socks which moved the rubbing to between the socks. I'm thinking a light pair of socks then Vaseline then hiking socks would be worth a try.",,"6,000 Steps","Jan 01, Thu",0
Broken Knee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479725,"Well the super early birds should have finished their first night on the trail and are being to make their first decisions under the influence of the trail. The class of 2015 is underway. Meanwhile I'm still reading and planning.As I read all these books recounting thru-hikes on the AT I see this pattern of bad decisions being made. I'm not sure if these are really bad decisions or just dramatic tellings of what the author doesn't really remember very well. Most of the books are by authors who did complete the whole hike, so it is hard to tell.As I was reading I remembered a couple of books I read maybe 7-10 years ago about climbing Mt. Everest. Near the top of the climb the air has only about 10% of the oxygen of air at sea-level. With so little oxygen you can't really think right and a lot of people die because of their bad decisions. Then I read about a guide who did the following. He made every decision beforehand and he wrote them down. All he had to do is check what he wrote in these critical situations. If we are not above x feet at 10 AM on the day we are reaching the summit, turn back. Things like that.It strikes me that such a system might work on the AT. I'm reading AWOL's book now and he talks about doing shorter miles to deal with a foot problem, but then when he reaches the shelter a little early he is undecided about whether to continue, even though his foot is killing him (in these cases he always does continue), he continues then 6 miles later wishes he had stopped. Other people get depressed or tired of the rain and quit. In all these cases you are making decisions when depressed or tired or in pain or afraid. These conditions would not seem to be optimal to make these decisions. Maybe a week later you are not depressed or a few sunny days later you regret quitting. I find it hard to believe that medical decisions made when you are rested are not better than ones made at the end of 15 miles of wet/cold hiking. Obviously some things just are: If you break your leg the hike is over.So I am going to try and answer the big questions ahead of time. After reading a few books and journals there is a pattern of decisions everyone seems to face. For example: If I am ready to quit because I'm depressed (wet, cold etc.) I will take two zeros to see if I still want to quit. Or: I want to quit because I can't take the rain any more. I will take zeros until the sun comes out for a day and see how I feel.Say I'm hitting the trail with a foot problem. I feel OK when I start. It is bothering me when I hit the first shelter or good camp site (with water). I will evaluated it and if it has bothering me for 1 hour and getting worse that is it or maybe if the next place to stop is more than 2 hours then I stop. It can be as complex as you want, but the key thing is to follow it. If after you follow it once and you want to revise it the next time you are in town and rested then go ahead. The thing is all these decisions are very emotional and heavily influenced by how you are doing emotionally. Why not make them under more reasonable conditions?Of course you have try and be objective. I read ""My foot is just killing me, but I walk on 10 miles"". All non-casual cyclists have ridden in great discomfort and I would bet that all long distance hikers have hiked in great discomfort. To me discomfort is when you are not hurting yourself. In the morning you are substantially better. You have to do it over and over to really start hurting yourself. Most people know the difference between pain and discomfort. If you are really hurting yourself you should stop, you are putting your whole trip in danger. Even at lower levels you should decide if you really want the kind of trip that is just misery, maybe if you slow down and put less physical pressure on your body you will enjoy your hike more.At least on matters of quitting and medical and safety issues I'm going to give it a try. If you have tried this approach let me know if it worked. If you think it is a bad or good approach let me know why.Thanks,",,Decision Making,"Jan 02, Fri",0
Broken Knee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479811,"I just finished with AWOL's book and I congratulate him on a very frank and honest description of his adventure. His survival skills are outstanding. If had my wife hike 21 miles in similar circumstances it would RIP Jim. All kidding aside everyone's hike is obviously different but by reading about the experiences of others you can start to get an idea of what you would like your hike to be. His book has been a huge help to me in thinking about what I want.As a German general famously said ""No plan survives the first contact with the enemy"" and I strongly doubt that any hiking plan survives the first contact with the AT, never the less you can start to identify certain things you would like for your hike and things you don't want.I don't know what AWOL's original plan was but I would say his hike evolved in to ""Any roof over my head is better than no roof"". Obviously the ""roofs"" only occur every so many miles and even if you don't have a firm end date in mind, that puts a lot of time pressure on you. It would seem that one of the things you might have wanted to escape has followed you on to the trail. If you are hurt or exhausted and have to do 10 more miles to a shelter, I'm going to guess that it is not the most enjoyable 10 miles nor the safest nor the smartest. I've done plenty of unsafe, dumb things already; enough to last a life time. I don't need to put myself in a position to have to do more of them.In some conditions (particularly bad thunder storms comes to mind) a roof is definitely a good idea. If you are looking forward to a more social experience I would think that the huts would also be a good idea at least when possible. To need to stay in a hut is not such a good idea from my perspective. One thing I have not gotten a good feel for is whether the huts produce the best sleeping experience. It could be that most people particularly mention a bad night's sleep but there are certainly a lot of bad nights spent in huts/shelters. On the other hand some people (Slow and Steady) mention getting a better night's sleep in their tent even when at a shelter.So far none of the journals I have read is by a ""hanger"" i.e. someone who uses a hammock. If anyone knows someone please point me to them. I have used one on a few overnighters and gotten a very good night's sleep, plus you can setup in far more places than a tent and with far less environmental impact.In any case I certainly don't want to kill myself or put myself in a difficult position trying to get to a mice filled shelter where I am not guaranteed a good night's sleep just to avoid sleeping without a fixed roof over my head.And I certainly don't want to be eaten alive by mosquitoes and black flies and other insects just to avoid carrying a couple of Ozs of netting.So while your plans will not survive the AT, they are important to make or you might be stuck on a hike you really don't want. You don't want to be thinking ""what am I going to do?"" about a problem you have never given a thought to.",,Thoughts on Shelters,"Jan 04, Sun",0
Broken Knee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480218,"On January 8th I had my hardware out. It was a long day at the hospital. I was not happy when at the last minute I had to make a choice about anesthesia which I didn't know was coming. How do the doctors think someone with no medical background can make that kind of decision at the last minute with no knowledge. In the end it was taken out of my hands by a delay in getting the O/R and I was forced to general. I was coming down with a cold, but things went ok, the anesthesiologist was able to suction well enough to keep junk out of my lungs.The surgeon (and later I) did get an unpleasant surprise. Something was going very wrong under the 8"" plate in my leg. There was a 4"" long hole in my tibia where all the bone has died. He was immediately concerned that this was the result of an infection that could cost me my leg or life. He cleaned it out and cultured it. He told my wife after the surgery but she was too nervous and didn't understand. By Saturday I was functional enough to be surprised by a dressing that went front the top of my thigh to my toes. It seemed a bit much. On Sunday I had just decided to call the doctor on Monday when the phone rang and it was him. He called to tell me there was no infection and I of course had no idea what he was talking about. So it is good there is no infection but there obviously was a major problem at the interface between the plate and my tibia that has left a large hole in my tibia.I see him in a week and I'm just hoping that it can somehow be fixed or I'm screwed. Until then I will keep reading and dreaming of the AT.If anyone wants a good read try ""Boots and Backpacks"" which combines two of my favorites ""Pride and Prejudice"" and the AT in one book. It is a modern retelling of ""Pride and Prejudice"". I'm quite sure Jane Austen would have loved the AT.",,Hardware out,"Jan 15, Thu",0
Broken Knee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480402,"I'm awaiting my doctor's appointment on Friday to how much of my Tibia is gone and just thinking about what type of hike I want.Just read Wingnut's journal and it was very interesting. You can tell he is ex-military by his planning and approach. Very upbeat and very goal oriented. He planned the trip and executed. I guess one good thing about the Army is you have marched enough to know your body can take it and how to manage it.I was in the Navy myself, operating a nuclear reactor on a fast attack submarine. Not a whole lot of walking to be done on a sub. At 6'3"" I did learn to duck, a lot of steel branches there, but I'm going to say if I was counting steps I would not have gone far.Like Wingnut I'm a big planner, but I guessing I'm a dozen years older and I don't think I want to be quite that ridged in my plans. Definitely want a more casual pace. I think you have to decided before hand what you are willing to sacrifice in terms of experience in order to insure you complete the trail in one season.

Broken Knee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480684,"Maybe I should change my name to Hollow Leg, went to the doctor and the hole was a lot worse than I thought. There was a hole behind the plate but it extends to a cavern underneath my Tibia. In effect the top is hollow. I guess there were to many breaks to heal and my body just absorbed the bone.Had a CT scan yesterday to let the doctor know the extent of the void. He will try a bone graft if possible and if not a custom prosthetic to fill the void. Either way I will be needing one more surgery. Now I'm looking for a new knee by the end of summer, not the beginning. A bone graft will take some months to heal.Well if I can get down to Florida by Winter at least I can exercise.

Broken Knee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483843,"So, I had my CT scan and the bad news is quite a bit of my left tibia is hollow starting just below the upper surface and going down about 4 inches. Even with that the leg feels more solid without the hardware than it ever did with it. The good news is that it looks like the walls that remain are strong enough to hold up to a knee replacement. That is good in that I will only need the one surgery instead of two.About a week into April I will have a total knee replacement. It will be done by two surgeons in Boston and they will fill the void at the same time. Depending on how things look when they get in they will do a bone graft or fill the void mechanically.With any luck I will be able to do light hiking by July and even better news it maybe that the snow here in Boston will have melted by July (I'm not holding my breath on that one though). I'm intensely jealous of all the 2015 people who are starting off, but while I'm not happy about yet another operation, I'm looking forward to hitting the trails again after 3 years as a cripple.I can't wait to start thinking about new hiking equipment instead of new body parts.",,Getting Time for a knee upgrade,"Mar 15, Sun",0
