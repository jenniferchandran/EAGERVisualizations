Yesterday, my wife drove me up to Millinocket and we stayed at the Katahdin Inn and Suites, nice and comfy. So today she drove me to Baxter State Park and I saw Katahdin for the first time in person. Gulp! Holy Blisters! That’s a big mountain. It’s the beginning of my adventure, I’m so excited but do I really have to start way up there? I’m covered with nervous sweat and she is chuckling, she didn’t sign up for this. So she is kind of giggling and trying not to at the same time so as to curb my feeling of “I’m going to throw up right NOW”. She is supportive that way. She drops me off at my lean to and spends a bit of time giving me a pep talk until the black flies press past her point of annoyance. Poof! She is in our car driving away with a wave. 
Hmmm, what to do, what to do now.
Set my bear bag
Nap
Find the Ranger Station
Find the beginning of the Hunt Trail
Nap
Watch people at the campground. I wonder if anyone else is beginning their SOBO AT trek?
Dinner
Filter a bunch of water
Sleep
So far, this adventure is pretty darn good. 
May 31, 2017
A beautifully cool day with a breeze and surprise thunder storm in the afternoon. Drove my mother in law for her PERM. Perms are a big deal and take over 2 hours. So I napped in my car for an hour (of course), went grocery shopping, picked up my beautiful coiffed MIL and went home. I loaded my mom’s car and my car with her quilts etc for the Farmer’s Market that she sells at on Fridays. Walked the dog, admired Mount Mansfield across Lake Champlain from my deck. Remembered my day from a year ago with great pleasure!

Despite the pins and needles, I slept very well in my lean to. My written journal says ”OMG Epic Hike, first part is a lie-nice and easy sucks you into feeling like a super hero, 2nd part is still a lie up to Katahdin Stream Falls, 3rd part is like the Adirondacks meaning its full of mud, roots, rocks and elevation, 4th part up to the Tablelands “I just can't talk about it!” and at last a jubilant “Success” finally putting my hands on the summit sign. Finally!  I remember a great day, nice and cool, no clouds, not too many people, just a great day. I remembered to eat breakfast, start early (6:30), pace myself, take enough water, use one of the day packs provided by the park rangers and follow the blazes. After about a quarter of a mile I realized that my loaner daypack really smelled bad. Oh sooo bad. Definitely a sign of smells to come. That steep part up to the Tablelands was actually amazingly fun, just a little scary, just a few places that I thought  “The hell? is THAT the trail?” Quite a day. I think of it often, meaning - every day. I got back to my lean to home at 3:30, happy with my jello legs. Napped, studied my map, ate dinner and off to sleep. Awesome day on the AT. 
June 1, 2017
Drove my MIL to her Senior center and picked her up in the afternoon. Met my friend for a walk in the woods with our dogs. Our dogs are friends and are enthusiastic woods runners. Cooked dinner and watched the big waves on Lake Champlain. Close my eyes and see the Summit Sign like it was now.
June 1, 2018
You never know, but I hope to be hiking up the crazy Hunt trail again.
Give your loaner pack a sniff test before choosing it. However it smells, so will your shirt until you can wash it, and that’s a long way from Katahdin.

I must have been tired at the end of the day. My journal entry says “Walked 13.3 miles. Am tenting at Hurd Brook Lean To. Quiet day. Met some people. But for now prefer my solitude. I am settled in tent after a beautiful day. Tired but happy. Saw bluejays and robins. Lots of very long stretches of flat trail peppered with short stretches of BIG rocks and roots, Maine style.” When I read a bunch of incomplete sentences devoid of detail, I know I was really tired. I do remember meeting a slew of south bounders. Sleeping Beauty stands out because I saw him first laying on a really big rock at the Abol Bridge store with his green hoodie over his face- yes sleeping! I met Chris, White Walker, Mojo, Pringles White Gurl, Alex, Henry, Lauren, Heather and Ryan. There were others, but I am not recalling their names.

Big day at the Farmer’s Market selling my mom’s quilts. It was freezing. I was so happy that I procrastinated dropping a bag of clothes in the Blue Donation box. I raided my bag to layer up.
Our booth is next to the Baker guy- absolutely perfect, I love bread.

I love it! I got up early, so excited for another day of hiking. People were still sleeping so I was very quiet, painfully (for me) quiet. I did enjoy a hot breakfast with tea and got all packed up without waking anyone. So happy to be walking  in the woods while it is waking up. Today the trail wound around Rainbow Lake with a constant cool breeze and the sounds of loons. The trail turned rocky, rooty and very muddy half way through the day. Shoe sucking kind of mud! Just like home! I had lunch by myself in view of the lake and kept thinking MY GOD, I AM HIKING THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL! It is taking a while to sink in that this is my life for the next 5 or 6 months. I love it already so I am hoping to stretch it out for the full 6 months. I hung out at the lean to a bit but decided to camp further up the trail. I assumed lots of people would be staying in the lean to and I wanted to be able to get up early again and not wake anyone. I found a really nice spot, had my dinner and listened to people arrive at the shelter. I recognized Chris, White Gurl, Mojo, White Walker, Alex and Ryan. Nice bunch of kids.

I love Maine. I love Maine today. Of course, it was a day that everything was perfect in my little world. Sunshine, not too hot, breezy so no bugs, one climb that sucked but not that much, a grand view of Nahmakanta Lake with Katahdin in the background. Katahdin was In the waaay back background! I have walked pretty far! I even got to swim today and wash the salt-sweat exfoliating layer off my delicate skin. Yes, a perfect day. I’m tenting at the Nahmakanta tent site on the river of the same name. My tent is comfortable and it feels like home. After the last few days on the trail, I am confident that I have plenty of food for the 100 mile wilderness. I’m carrying too much food I think. My body is tired but not beat. No blisters yet. I am not completely sick of couscous and tuna, that’s a good thing since there is a lot of that in my bear bag. 2 SOBOS showed up and are camped on the other side of the trail, Peter from Wisconsin and a woman from Florida but I can’t recall her name. I visited for a little while and admired Peter’s ultra light set up, he made some of his gear and clothing, all really nice. Off to bed awaiting another day on the trail. 
Still the oldest hiker and that is ok.

Cooper Brook Lean To mile 59.7   15.7 miles
The biggest mile day so far, 15.7 miles. Wow. Huh! I am feeling pretty good. Hmmm, I have felt this way before and as I recall, I crash, burn and fumble at the beginning of backpacking trips. I really need to think about taking a nero right here in the 100 mile wilderness, to be smart and take care of my Insect legs and spirit. After all, this isn’t an ordinary backpacking trip. it’s the APPALACHIAN TRAIL!!! Sorry, that never gets old for me.The trail was a nice tread way of soft pine needles that followed streams and wove along some ponds and Jo-Mary Lake. What? yes, you can assume I dove in and took a swim in the lake. It was fantastic! I crossed Jo-Mary road which was my mind’s half way point for the 100 mile wilderness. That felt wonderful. The only elevation came at the end of the day and it was minimal push up to the Lean To spot. It’s really pretty here. I used my Delorme (affectionately called the “Delorian”) to check the weather and it looks like 100% yes for rain. I’m sleeping for the first time in the Lean To and it is packing up for sure. I ate the last of my Tuna (YAY) and sat back and listened to my shelter mates laughing and sharing stories. We have, Sarge- wants to hike the trail fast, Mojo- a cool dude from Florida, Chris, White Walker- hiked all the 48 White mountains to prepare for this trek!, Legs and Sister, Hooch, Fraug - formerly Alex, Statesman- someone older than me!, he section hikes a state a year and this is his last state, IMPRESSIVE., Denora, Rising Pheonix, Samantha and 2 others. This made me chuckle, Legs and Sister were examining their poor feet. Sister said “Ugh, I have swollen blisters under each big toe nail and I don’t have the internet to tell me what to do!” As soon as it starts to rain, I have to pee. Happens every time.
I have too many Clif Bars. They are heavy and people are already sick of them, can’t give the things away.

East Branch Lean To 
I am tenting by the brook and it is so perfect, great view and the brook isn’t too loud. I got myself up over Little Boardman Mountain, a climb of about 1200 feet. I felt it, but I expected to and I went really slow. I was able to swim just before the climb in Little Crawford Pond. It is just so refreshing to have all this water around. I am thankful there is water EVERYWHERE, I don’t worry about carrying extra water. The sky was cloudy for the most part but the sun managed to send some rays out now and then. There is a bench here and I am having my dinner down by the water. I am having mac and cheese made with Ditalini pasta and organic cheddar cheese powder. It’s ok, maybe its a good thing that I am so hungry. If I were home I would probably say “yeah, ok, this recipe is not going in my repeat file, kinda icky.” The powdered cheese is making clean up a nightmare. As per Leave No Trace, I put some water in my pot and scrape the leftover food from my pot, swish it around, shut my eyes real tight and go for it- drink the grey water down really fast. yes. It’s what I do to ensure that I am not the reason a wild critter comes looking for food at a shelter. Ugh, that clean up is nasty! It poured last night and I was glad to be a little sardine in the lean to, a nice and dry sardine. Well, it’s only 6:00 and I’m going to turn in. Maybe some others will show up later. 
Big climbs are coming up, the White Cap Mountains. I wonder how I will do?

Logan Brook Lean To  mile 71.4      3.6 miles hiked
How do I hike these big miles?? 3.6 miles today, makes for a fabulous luxury day off in the 100 mile wilderness. I checked my DeLorean and it told me today it would start raining at 11:00 a.m. Perfect!I checked my map and saw the next shelter was a big 3.6 miles away so I got up early had a great breakfast and ran here, set myself up in the Lean To and prepared to accomplish nothing more for the rest of the day. I’m so happy, it started drizzling at 11:00 and I made a pot of tea and snuggled up in my sleeping bag. The young crew, Flash, Sarge, Legs, 2 Sisters, Hooch, Fraug, White Walker, Mojo, Stretch and Smitty all went ahead to tackle the White Cap mountains today. I need to rest up before I try those big peaks if I am going to make it all the way to Georgia. I think DeNora and Peter will be coming along today. Ok, it’s later now, I had the most beautiful series of naps today and feel pretty fresh. Peter, Grannie (Heather), White Gurl and Pringles? showed up- all SOBO and later 2 very interesting NOBOs came. Just Mike, a crazy looking older dude with a wild and matted beard made his entrance singing Christmas songs loudly and enthusiastically. He came with his friend Handmade. Handmade is probably the most interesting hiker I’ve ever met. He wears underwear that he says look like shorts anyway (They don’t, the look EXACTLY like mens underwear) and has a long sleeveless T shirt that looks like a dress. He also uses a handmade wooden pack made from a chair back! He demonstrated how functional it is and told stories about going through the Whites bare foot. He obtained boots after he nearly killed himself on the ice. He is currently shoeless. His diet consists of crushed up pop tarts and a mixture of brown sugar, oats and lard or butter and m-n-ms when available. He eats all of this with a flat stick. I was thoroughly entertained all evening. I was glad to have met them. Handmade is kinda of legendary according to Just Mike.

Fourth Mountain, Fourth Mountain
That was today’s itinerary! So much elevation and loss (sad). An incredible day, I loved every minute of it, even my grand mistake. Later on that.  I didn’t see people today which made me feel like I was really out in the wild. The constant breeze and clouds added still another dimension to the wild. I took my time, got into a groove and soaked in all the beauty I could. Something shifted in my thinking today. My thoughts slowed down and I focused on, well, nothing and everything around me at the same time. It’s a happy thing. There was a huge rock scramble early in the day, I saw the jumble of rocks in the distance and secretly hoped the trail would lead me to that climb. Oh yes! that’s fun going UP, it’s not so much fun going down a steep rock scramble. I was stopped in my tracks just before going up Fourth Mountain by the sight of an enormous newly fallen tree. I patted the horizontal trunk and said “Sorry old pal” and went on my way up, up, up Fourth Mountain. I nodded to the summit sign and descended to a col where I stopped for lunch. Full of peanut butter and honey, I picked up my pack and went on my way, up,up, up yet another peak. I nodded to the summit sign which said Fourth Mt. and momentarily thought hmmm, that’s odd. Down and more down, opps! I stopped in my tracks and said “Well, Hello old pal! I don’t suppose you have a twin?” Nope. I realized that I hiked the wrong direction after lunch. AHHHHHHHH! I have decided to adopt a habit of ALWAYS sticking my green hiking pole in front of my red hiking pole so it points in the  direction that I need to go EVERY time I stop. I took my 2 best poles with me on this trip and they happen to be different colors- turns out to be a useful oddity. After my extra miles and extra climb I finally reach the blue trail to Cloud Pond Lean To. It’s about a half mile! On a narrow and muddy trail! It’s windy, misty and Cold! The Pond itself is kind of spooky, dark and foggy. This is the first time I’ve collected water from a non- running source. Now I see the importance of having a scoop or a sturdy smart water bottle. I have only my Sawyer bags. They collapse in standing water, It’s slick and unbalanced here for me to try to scoop up water with this bag! Hmmm. Another lesson, I am getting a smart water bottle and a scoop. My hand is frozen from sticking it in this Cloud Pond! I am the only person here until some familiar faces stumbled in -frozen and sure they were all going to die! Peter, Honeybun, Pringles, Lavender (Heather) and White Gurl. They were starving and pooling their pitiful supplies, I was finally able to unload some of my extra food! Thank you to the starving Intrepid 5 for lightening my load! I am happy to see this group of very funny hikers roll in, they make me smile. 
I’m learning a thing or two.

Ice, Icicle, frozen nose, frozen toes, numb bum, how else can I say that I froze at Cloud Pond Lean To? It was windy and drizzly and darn cold!! I have my 45 degree bag and thermal liner, I think I am going to get a thermarest thermal blanket in Monson. It’s been nippy, this isn’t the first cold night I’ve had although its been THE nippiest. Great views from Barren Mt. and the Barren Ledges. I walked a long time looking down at the Big Wilson Valley. You can look 360 degrees here and not see anything related to MAN. No houses, roads, electric lines, nothing. It’s nice. The trail crossed 4 streams, 2 were rock hops and 2 I just got wet feet. It’s ok, I will be in town tomorrow! I am settled in the lean to and expect to see the Intrepid 5 at some point. It will be a hoot to hear their stories of the day. 
Doing well with my go green pole habit.

Route 15 and Shuttle to Shaw’s Hostel in Monson.
mile 114.5        3 miles hiked
This is the BEST. The best bed, best room, best food, best shower, best washer and dryer, best town, best host and hostess - Poet and Hippie Chick. Thank you for operating this hostel! Poet and Hippie Chick are AT thru hikers and not only provide this amazing hostel experience, they share their AT know-how. Poet will shake down and shake out your pack to get rid of extra unnecessary items and really get rid of weight. Honey Bun had a shake down, he was carrying over 85 lbs in his Army pack. Honeybun is an Iraq Veteran. Poet got him into a pack that fit and a weight of 35 pounds I think. That’s amazing, it’s also amazing that Honeybun was carrying so much weight from Katahdin to Monson! I got rid of 5 lbs myself, extra bowl, too many batteries, extra headlamp, extra underwear and socks, toe nail clippers (I use a file), bug nets, deodorant, lotion, shampoo and a bulky sweater. It all adds up! If I haven’t used it in 100 miles, I definitely don’t need to carry it. 
The Intrepid 5 and I assembled at route 15 and Shaw’s shuttle van picked us up, I realized how smelly we were when we were crammed in the confines of the van. Wow, made my eyes water! I elected to treat myself to a room, so nice to have a clean, quiet space to myself. I had signal and was able to call home and catch up with everyone. My god, I get really homesick sometimes. The hostel provided loaner clothes so that we could get all of our laundry done without having to put on rain gear (its sticky and uncomfortable!) or wrap in a towel. I had 2nd lunch at Pete’s coffee shop and diner, excellent coffee, grilled ham and cheese, soup and a cinnamon bun. I brought a sub back for dinner. Mostly I napped, ate, in a haze of squeaky clean tiredness. Cold and drizzly day but a great day indeed. 
Made it through the 100 mile wilderness, sweet.

Monson Maine, zero day   mile 114.5    0 miles hiked
Despite my quiet room and comfortable bed, I had a difficult time sleeping. I think I had too much stimulation from coffee, texting, people and talking to family. I also agonized about every item I sent home, agonized about going to Greenville to get a thermal blanket, agonized about how much to resupply my food bag, agonized about my next section, agonized about agonizing. Finally I had to pull myself together!! I was fine on the trail, no worries, I have to be able to keep that attitude while in towns. What is wrong with me? I will work on this. Well, I did. I relaxed after eating the entire Shaw’s breakfast of pancakes, home fries, eggs, bacon and sausage (that was at 7:30, I'm starving again at 11:00) I decided yep, I am cold at night so I need something. There is an outfitter in the next town of Greenville so Pringles and I hitched. We got a ride from a nice guy in a Subaru (the engine light was on) still no worries. I found my blanket and it weighed under 1 lb, Pringles got shoes. We stuck our thumbs out and another Subaru picked us up. This lady had a box of donuts! Score! She insisted that we eat some. Her engine light was on too. Curious. Nothing bad happened so I am just not going to worry about engine lights anymore. I am going to try to just not worry. I spent the rest of the day, hanging out in the hiker common room listening to hikers tell their stories, Peter, finally accepted a sort of trail name of “Petah”. He had rejected all names offered and only slightly committed to an exaggerated pronunciation of his name. The Intrepid 5 have bonded into a family of siblings, they bicker, laugh, poke fun and support each other. Petah, Honeybun, White Gurl (who is actually a boy), Lavender and Pringles. I assume they will outdistance me soon but its nice to hang out with them for now. Next town is Caratunk, I will skip it and hike on to Stratton for my next resupply. Decision made and No Worries!

Horseshoe Canyon Lean To  mile 123.5      9.0 miles hiked
Oh so difficult to leave the comforts of the Hostel and abundant food in town. However, I had to be done. And I did it. After Breakfast, I took the early shuttle back to the woods and hiked on. Sean,  young guy from Indiana who recently graduated walked with me for a while. He wears a wonderful purple buff- stands out in the sea of green. It’s the first time I’ve been hiking and talking with someone, so of course I wandered off the trail. We had to backtrack about 10 minutes to find it. In my defense the area had many side trails unmarked by blue blazes. Easy trail today, Somewhat overcast but not bad. I set up in the Lean To because it looked like rain, even though I knew better. Was is worth it to sleep like a sardine with the Intrepid 5 plus Sean the purple Buff Boy? White Gurl snores and Sean looks like a snorer or worse a teeth grinder.  Eh, it’s a trade off. Dry with snoring and no wiggle room? or pack a wet tent in the morning with quiet in my spacious tent? I flipped an imaginary coin and it chose the Lean To.
Eased back into the woods without too much pain.

Bald Mountain Brook Lean To  mile 132.4     8.9 miles hiked
Most important for today, Congratulations to my niece Brittany as she graduates from High School. I know for certain this is one of the happiest days of her life! A great hike up and over Moxie Bald Mountain today. The trail was kind of flatfish, following the Piscataquis River and then Bald Mountain Stream. I stopped at the Bald Mountain Pond Lean To on Bald Mountain Pond for lunch, a nice spot. After a nice rest I went up Moxie Bald Mountain, 1400 ft. climb which wasn't bad at all. The last mile was exposed, navigating from cairn to cairn. After the second cairn, clouds and wind rolled in. That happened really fast and I was glad I happened to be standing right next to a cairn. I couldn’t see the next cairn! I’ve been in clouds before but this was like being inside a marshmallow! I had to wait for a break and take a compass bearing when I spotted the next cairn. That worked until I was at the summit sign. It was so barren and I couldn't spot the next cairn. HMMMF, now I am in a marshmallow again. I don’t want to leave the safety of my summit sign but I don't know which way to look to try to spot the next cairn. OH! It’s 2016 and I have Technology!! I took out my phone and opened up Guthook, the little GPS arrow pointed me in the right direction. I still used my compass as a safety measure as I walked in Guthook's direction and finally found the next cairn hiding down below the summit rise. I did this until I reached tree line and could follow a real and visible trail. Back in the woods it was kind of pleasant, hard to believe that not too far away I was in a gusty blurry marshmallow without my bearings. I was at the Lean To by 2:30 even though it seemed like I was on the exposed summit forever. I got myself all set up, my tent this time,  for the evening and am having cocoa. The Intrepid five plus Purple Buff Boy aren’t here yet but I do expect them at some point. 
They showed up in the early evening minus Pringles, who showed up later in dramatic fashion saying she had been lost and without hope on Moxie Bald, blinded by the clouds half dead with fear. Now I think she is a warrior for getting herself safely to the Lean To.

Tenting at Pleasant Pond Lean To mile 145.5       9.9 miles hiked
This turned out to be a short day, very pleasant, sunny and a little cool. The hike wasn’t too hard. It included a 2 mile stretch along an old logging road. I passed by 2 power lines which made me sad that maybe I was leaving what I assumed was the wildest and furthest-from-civilization  section of trail.  The trail had 1 water ford, crossing Baker Stream, turned out to be a safe crossing. I hung out a while at the water it was such a pleasant spot. I climbed Middle Mountain and Pleasant Mountain and all of the ups and downs in between- there were many!! So, I am here at the Pleasant Pond Lean To early (12:30) and decide to put up my tent and relax for the rest of the day. I took a nice swim without my clothes. It’s quiet until the Intrepid 5 show up (YAY!) and take their time deciding to stay. They like riddles and the current riddle is “Cosmic number 4” —“1 is 3, 3 is 5, 5 is 4 and 4 is Cosmic!” any number you start with cam be whittled logically to cosmic number 4. “ 17 is 9, 9 is 4 and 4 is Cosmic!” Can you figure it out? I did and it kept me occupied for about an hour!! Later as I was starting to fall asleep, I hear a huge ruckus at the Lean To, screaming and shouting “OH MY GOD!! IS THAT REAL? IS IT REAL? ITS MOVING OH MY GOD!” I hear the Intrepid 5 scramble to get out of the Lean To and I think there is a bear headed our way. So I get out of my tent and get to the Lean To. It’s a SPIDER, A WOOD SPIDER! Granted they are ugly and grow really big but I thought it was kinda funny. White Gurl actually slept in his hammock and refused to go into that Lean To again. 
Cosmic number 4 and a Spider, can’t beat that!

Pierce Pond Lean to mile 155.2   hiked 9.7 miles
What a glorious day! I had a mission, just a scant 5.8 miles was US route 201. A couple miles down that road was a Norther Outdoor Center and they served Breakfast!! So, Yes, I was up and hiking at 5:20 after having breakfast no. 1. I really love to be hiking early enough to watch the woods transition from all of the night activity to daylight activity. Sometimes I stop to watch the sun rays creep up as the sun rises. I was able to fly to the road and walk to my pancake place. No luck hitching, although I noticed a full Subaru pass me and someone waved- hmm it was Pringles. Anyway, I enjoyed a good breakfast and charged up all my electronics and got a ride back to the trail. Nice way to start a day. Next, I hiked to the Kennebec river where the official crossing is in a canoe paddled by “Dan”. There is a white blaze painted on the bottom of the canoe. It’s a wide river that has unpredictable water surges when a dam is let up upstream. Hence, the safety of the canoe. I took a nap on the other side of the river as I only had 3 miles to this location. A relaxing day before I have to start going over the Bigelow Mountains. On the way to Pierce Pond Lean To, I noticed a sign for Harrison’s camp and something about signing up for a 12 pancake breakfast. Of Course, I went to sign up, I came up to a very rustic Adirondack style cabin in the middle of nowhere. There was 1 main cabin and some outbuildings in the woods. I wasn’t sure I wanted to proceed, however, there was that pull of pancakes. To my surprise Jim, let me in the cabin and its like going back in time to a logging camp dining room. It was Awesome!!! old wood stove, twig furniture, animal heads on the wall (ick). Jim signed me up and said to be at the place at 7:00 sharp. This is very exciting. The lean to was a short .7 miles away and I was there in no time. I tented down by the water and took a nice swim, it’s a beautiful pond. A Maine pond is like a normal state’s lake. The Intrepid 5 showed up as well as Purple Buff Boy, Long John and 3 others. I relaxed in my tent and watched the water until I fell asleep.

Little Bigelow Lean To  mile 172.9      Hiked 17.7 miles
I cried, I cried right during my beautiful 12 pancake breakfast. Jim Harrison had a keyboard in the dining room and asked if anyone minded if he noodled around alittle. “Well of course not!” I had finished my Strawberry pancakes and the Blueberry pancakes and was going for the plain pancakes when he started to play Beethoven, “Moonlight Sonata”. Oh, are you kidding me? That melody always makes me tear up, add a perfect morning, perfect breakfast, the perfect CCC Camp venue and the Intrepid 5, of course I notice tears flowing down my cheeks. It was an awesome feeling. I am a lucky one to be living, and I remembered that at that moment. Petah got up and played Piano Man and got everyone singing. I do need to mention that it is really difficult to hike with 12, no 13 pancakes in your belly. Pringles gave me her last pancake because she was stuffed. I felt waddly-ish for a few miles. I had an extremely nice trail to West Carry Pond Lean To, and took advantage of the sandy beach to take a swim. Next stop Little Bigelow Lean To after a moderate elevation gain. Its a beautiful spot and I set up my tent and went to soak in the stream, lots of pools to choose from. I had a signal and spent a happy half hour or so texting with my nephew Josh. It’s hard to be away from family. You miss stuff. Tomorrow starts the Bigelow Range, back up in the 4000 footers, that’s exciting. I think I’m ready.
I am going to add 2.9 miles to my miles hiked today, this site auto adds up the miles and somewhere I must have entered data incorrectly. I really am at mile 172.9. and the site calculator is 2.9 miles behind.

Cranberry Stream Tentsite mile 186.4    13.5 miles hiked
Ok, time to feel confident and not cocky. I had a beautiful day going over the most beautiful peaks! Lots of elevation gain and loss and I was ok with it. Little Bigelow, Avery Peak, Bigelow and South Horn.  All beautiful, all above tree line, so very cool. I saw a day hiker with his family, a young guy sporting a cap with the Adirondack 46er patch. I think I scared him when I bounded up to him and said (too loudly) Hi! Are you a 46er?! Me too! A 46er is someone who has climbed all of the 46  Adirondack 4000’ mountains. We stopped to talk and this family is from Keene Valley, heart of the Adirondacks, near where I live and one of my ultra favorite towns. I don’t know why, but I felt a physical boost after talking with these people about familiar things even though I didn’t know them at all. I am pretty quiet on the trail and maybe I miss more than my family. Anyway, Thank You Keene Valley Family for the boost, you made my day. I planned to stay at this tent site because it is just a short 1.8 miles to Maine Route 27. This is important because I am getting low on food and the town of Stratton is just a mile or so down the road. I plan to resupply and eat, but am undecided if I want to stay in town. The tent site is really crowded, I managed to wedge myself between 2 big groups. The group farthest from the trail is loud, lots of drinking and swearing and laughing. They like to use F- - -  as a universal adjective. I don’t care, I just find it repetitive and benign after hearing the same word 100 times. The group forward is a church group of young boys and their 3 leaders. They are having fun making a huge dinner with lots of yummy ingredients. I put up my tent, got water, ate, cleaned up and hung my bear bag before they got anything cooking. Their dinner was 100 times better than mine though! The Intrepid 5 and Purple Buff Boy raced by going into Stratton tonight. 
Should I be sick of rice and pepperoni this early in the hike?

All Right! Town day! Town, I am beginning to love that word. And Stratton is SO close! I am up early, so are the church boys, we pack up quietly so as not to wake up the vocabulary deficient group. I am walking into Stratton at 8:30 A.M. Its another paradise, there is a bunkhouse, grocery store and diner. I am all set. First, grocery shop, I decide to get enough food to get to Andover and skip going into Rangely. So once again I am food heavy. I buy my supplies and find a shaded spot near the store to repack everything. I get rid of almost all the packaging material and repack the food into ziplock bags. It fits better and I don’t have to deal with much trash on the trail. I kind of feel like a homeless person when I do this. After repacking I go back for a couple of yogurts, whoopie pie, 2 plums, 1 banana and a chocolate milk. I consume this sitting outside the grocery store looking at the Stratton Bunkhouse across the street. It’s too tempting, a bunk, electricity, shower, kitchen for 25$ and I have all day and night to relax. I do it, walk across the street and get my bunk. Now that that is settled I take a luxurious shower, get a pizza for later and nap. Mid- morning, a car drives into town and the Intrepid 5 stumble out, they grocery shop and continue on the trail. Apparently they scored a spot in a person’s house and were wined and dined all night! Pringles and Purple Buff Boy are staying in Stratton. I was able to talk to my family for a long time, thats so nice. I really miss them. My bunkmates so far are Pringles and Banchee. From what I can gather, Banchee just graduated from high school and has made it this far on the trail never having set foot in the woods apparently. I hear some of the guys downstairs giving him some advice. There are a bunch of people here. Purple Buff Boy, Pringles, Balou- a new Dad from California I think, and others too. There is an important sporting event going on and everyone is watching it downstairs on the TV. 
I noticed a laundry mat late in the afternoon, I was disappointed because I felt compelled to do my laundry and didn't really want to expend the energy. In the end I didn’t do it. Stinky clothes, is that bad?

Whew! I am toast! My first day hiking in heat and I am done in for the day. Today started with a 3000 foot climb up to North Crocker Mountain, then down, then up South Crocker Mountain. Beautiful view from S. Crocker straight down 1800 feet to a glacial cirque. I rested a bit there. More elevation loss and a climb up to a ridge with awesome views of the Carabasset Valley. Over a shoulder of Spaulding mountain and up Sugarloaf Mountain. Ugh! It was a hot day, did I mention? It took all day and 6 liters of water to hike this 13.5 miles. I am a sweaty mess but feel ok besides being melted. I am happy with my slow pace, resting, eating and hydrating because I needed it to stay healthy today. I am laying in my tent not moving because I can’t. Won’t. I refuse to move!

What a wonderful day!! I recovered from hiking in the sauna yesterday, today was sunny with a cool breeze. I climbed up to Saddleback Jr., over to the Horn and on to Saddleback. Much of today was above treeline with amazing 360 degree views. I walked over bare rock and carefully through alpine bogs. It was beautiful. I stood for long periods of time watching the alpine plants deal with the gusty breeze. It’s amazing how they survive, it’s pretty stark up here. I made it over the Saddlebacks!!

I started lazy and late on this nice cool morning. My Delorean indicated that it would be pouring rain this afternoon so I had my rain jacket and rain cover handy. I hiked past some areas that used to be beaver ponds but the beavers have long since moved and the pond has returned to land, kind of neat. The hike was not difficult although it was full of up then down and repeat. I enjoyed to cool air. As promised it started to downpour about 1 hour before I got to the Lean To. No matter, I knew I I would get wet today. I arrived at the Lean To, got water, got set up under the roof and snuggled in my sleeping bag. A total of 7 other people arrived and did the same thing. A sardine club again. Here are some sad notes:
My shoes are shredding
I lost my wonderful pocket knife
I have a small hole in the butt of my pants
Both of my pairs of socks are wet and smell really baaaaad
The mesh on my water bottle sleeve on my pack has a hole in it
Oh well, if thats the worst, all is WELL!

I am so aware of other people so close to me that I feel like I have to sleep in one position and I think I log roll a lot as I sleep. I got up at 4:00, and hiked it here to the Bemis Mountain Lean To and yep, set up my tent. It was a spectacular hike. I started before dawn and got to see the forest change from night to day, it is so pretty. I love it. The trail was mostly flattish with one climb of about 1500 feet up to Bemis Second Peak. I got to the Lean To at 11:00 and decided to hang out at this spot. Here are the hikers that showed up:
White Gurl, Honey Bun, Baloo, Hooch! I haven't seen these guys for days! Also I met Rocky Horror and Rippa- from New Zealand, Slipping Jake- just graduated from UNC Chapel Hill I think, he is on the extreme Frisbee Team and Noah - first time meeting him. . A good crowd today.

Ugh, this was a hard day of steep ups and downs. Wow, why was I so tired? It was so steep that I had to keep my eyes on the ground. As a result, I noticed many and varied moss clumps. I devised the game of moss busting in the tradition of cloud busting. I imagined lots of cool shapes and animals in the moss clumps. I started to name moss families and neighborhoods and that’s when I thought maybe I was tipping over the edge! I also noticed tons of glittery mica in the bedrock, like glittery snow well, except that it was rock. I enjoyed grand views from Old Blue Mountain and took a good rest there. I could see a wind farm in the distance. The further south I go the more MAN stuff I come across, a ski area, power line swaths, roads. Its still really wild but I see MAN stuff every day now. The same crew shows up here later. Good banter and stories at the Lean To. Almost every one commented on the steepness of the trail today, usually in colorful language. I didn’t feel so bad knowing that other people found the trail difficult today.

East B Hill Road (to Andover Maine)  mile 256.9    6 miles hiked  
Another town day!! I am stoked to get to town early. I like to stay as near town as possible so I can hike in early and have a whole day for chores, eating and relaxing. So I am up early, enjoy my breakfast knowing I will soon be having a REAL breakfast in town. I had arranged for a shuttle from the Pine Ellis Hostel to pick me up at noon, so I had a long time to hike the 6 miles to the road. I would get to town a little later than I like, but a free shuttle isn’t something to pass up. I hiked up over Wyman Mountain and the usual ups and downs. A refreshing slow hike. I was at the road crossing at 10:30. Hmmm, it’s still  pretty remote here and I am glad I have a shuttle because there is NO traffic. One by One the crew of young men show up, Honeybun, White Gurl, Slipping Jake and Hooch. I know they had a definite plan to crush miles today. They collected at the road and someone mentioned “All You Can Eat Italian Day” and so very quickly plans changed into “crushing some Italian” in Andover. Easy decision since they knew I had a shuttle coming. I don’t mind except they really smell and the smell intensifies in closed spaces- like a shuttle van. It’s nice to hang with them, I probably won’t see them after Andover because they hike faster and plan longer days. I plan to stay 2 nights at Pine Ellis. The shuttle comes, the driver is a hoot, we get the tour of town. Its one square mile, and it is beautiful. A diner/ grocery, library, restaurant, houses, even a tiny home. Everything I need. I check into the Pine Ellis and at first choose the bunk house but switch to the bunk room upstairs in the house. The bunk house was a little sketchy and there was a young man (Karate Kid?) there who seemed not happy that I was sharing the space. I think he wasn’t feeling well or was injured, it happens, so I gave him space. The bunk room is wonderful, its just a big room with as many twin beds that will fit. My spot is comfy and has a little shelf next to it on the wall. I put laundry in and get some loaner clothes and set out to the diner/ grocery. I purchase my snacks and eat with a big crew of SOBOS at the tables outside. I am the only girl and I could be everyones Mom. How strange. Back to Pine Ellis for a shower and nap, later I have the big Italian feast at the Red Hen, with the big crew. I also meet “That Guy and The Duchess of Slugs”, they are tenting behind the restaurant. Back to my nice bed and relax. 3 NOBOS are here, I enjoy their stories and wonder If I will be as cool and casual after 2000 miles as they are.

Such a good day! I enjoyed a huge breakfast at the diner, pancakes, bacon and eggs with real coffee. Bought snacks and some resupply. I face timed with family, wrote some post cards, sat on the porch swing and listened to the Pine Ellis Ladies laugh and bicker. They could host a reality show, for sure. One of the guests saw my shoes and was terribly concerned and thought I should be arranging to get to an outfitter TODAY to replace them. I got some super glue and used it with duct tape to fix my shoes, they need to get me to Gorham, where I hear I can buy new shoes. Pine Ellis has a decent resupply cabinet on the front porch. I get the key, take what I want and give my list with prices to the Pine Ellis Lady. She says, well, you can go ahead and add it up better than I can. So I did! I have 4 days of food to get to Gorham, That’s in NEW HAMPSHIRE!
I am hoping that Super Glue and Duct Tape live up to their reputations so I won't be walking into Gorham in my sock feet.

No Thanks!! My poor Pine Ellis Driver “oh, well she can’t hardly hear or see so she gets the wrong information on the shuttle board! I just go by the board you know! she really needs to see about her ears, can’t hear nothing except the TV!” "" I am just the driver you know!"" All said with good humor, please don’t get the wrong impression, the Pine Ellis Ladies are very kind and very funny.  I have no set destination and it feels nice. It’s a warm but beautiful day. I pass by Dunn Falls, the shoulder of Surplus Mountain, Frye Notch Lean To, Little Baldpate Mountain, East Baldpate, Baldpate, West Baldpate and yes, Baldpate Lean To. The climbs are not horrible and I walk on an open ridge for part of the day. Old Speck looks challenging with a 2600 foot climb. I start the climb and notice a nice flat spot near a cascade, it’s a little close to the trail but it’s perfect. I set up my tent, soak in the cascade, hang my bear bag line and rest. It’s been a good day. One hiker passes by later in the evening and admires my spot. Thats the only person I see today except for my gracious Pine Ellis shuttle driver.

Today is the day of the Dreaded Mahoosic Notch. I have heard it’s the most horrible crazy and dangerous section of the entire Appalachian Trail. It bears the moniker MahooSUCK. I hear I have a very steep decent of 1600 feet in about 1 mile and then a mile of car sized boulders to navigate. Thats after climbing the rest of Old Speck Mountain. This will be an interesting day! I make it up Old Speck and take the blue blaze trail to the actual summit. I can see a plateau looking area and a steep drop off, I assume thats my descent. It looks not too bad, from here. I am oh so WRONG! The descent goes on for ever, I just can't believe it and my legs start to feel like jello. So I need to sit occasionally and chill out. Jeekers, that’s steep. I am finally at the bottom and have a brief respite of flatness. I notice a short side trail leading to a large flat camping area with a nice stream. I go to check it out, its really nice and if it were later in the day maybe I would have tented there. I start to go back to the trail and I can't find it! What?! As I said, it’s a big area. I have to poke around a bit to get back on the trail. Very soon I am immersed in huge boulders, they are just enormous! Car sized, How about bus sized? I have never been through anything like this. Many places I have to stop and figure out how to proceed. This is really a lot of fun! I guess you just pick a path and keep heading through the boulder field. I have to take my pack off several times to get under and through some spots. There is ice in some of the crevices. I take a lot of time here, you have to, it’s not a walk in the park. So I think I can make to the state line for sure today, I am feeling good. Ugh, until I realize I have another mountain to go over. Ouch! I get over Fulling Mill Mountain and collapse soon after at Full Goose Lean To, 4.1 miles from the State Line. That hurts! 2 SOBOS are here, Alex and another but I don’t catch his name.

29 days to hike the 281.8 miles in Maine
Welcome to N.H.!!!!!!
Maine doesn’t like to let you go. No indeed. The Goose Eye Mountains were in the way, then this crazy climb near the Mount Carlo blue blaze trail. I was hiking along and where the heck is the trail? I came up to a rock wall. I refused to believe that was the trail. After looking for an alternative to what I secretly knew was the truth, I took off my pack and climbed hand over hand up the wall and , yup, there was a white blaze. Oh Crap! I love Maine but it is time to move on!! I have to go back down for my pack and figure out a way to get myself and it up all this craziness. And my left shoe is now hopelessly shredded, I have to clear out rocks and debris about every 100 feet. It’s cloudy, I smell rain. Hey, what’s this? It’s the STATE LINE!!! I am so happy I cry like a 5 year old on my birthday. I really did. Then I ate my state line celebration snickers bar, so satisfying. My first hike in New Hampshire was up and over Mount Success. Success! Finally in my second state. The rain starts and I hear thunder in the distance just as I get to what I think is the summit, I am correct and start to hustle off the mountain as the thunder gets closer and I see lightening. Oh Crap! Mount Success is one long broad exposed expanse! Crazy again, I just start running, the thunder and lightening are chasing me, how big is this summit????? Yikes, finally I get back under treeline but continue to hoof it to Gentian Shelter. Thank God! I make it without becoming a casualty. During a break in the rain, I am able to set up my tent. The shelter is getting crowded and there is a large group of young girls tenting somewhere near. Busy place today.

Route 2, White Mountain Lodge and Hostel mile 298.2   11.7 miles hiked
Town!! I got up early and was hiking by 6:15, Yesterday, I kept checking to see if I had a signal so I could call the Hostel and reserve a bunk for 2 nights. I heard that It’s a popular place being right on the trail and I wasn’t going to miss my chance to stay. I did make my call and was relieved to know that I had a spot. Yesterday, Alex, another SOBO, whom I have run into from time to time was planing to head to the lodge but upset that she didn't have a reservation, her phone was dead. She was almost out of food. I lent her my phone and gave her some pickings from my food bag. No worries. I am sure this will happen to me at some point and the favor will be returned. The terrain was fairly easy and mostly descending all the way to Route 2. I put all my thoughts away and just walked at an easy pace and was delighted to see the Lodge right in front of me at 12:15. Marnie is the owner and she runs a top notch service. There is a system for smelly hikers. First you enter the garage, your shoes go on the shoe wall. Next your stinky pack goes on a hook on the garage wall,  take out all your laundry go into a changing room and put on loaner clothes, all your stinky laundry goes into a basket. Clean laundry appears in a basket in the common living room in the afternoon. Then you go into the house (finally) to the kitchen and settle up for your overnight bill. You get a quick tour that ends at one of the shower rooms, you are given a towel and wash cloth and encouraged to shower immediately. Well. OK then. It works, everyone who is actually inside is freshly showered and wearing clean smelling loaner clothes. SMART. Tonight I am in a gorgeous bunk room that has 5 bunkbeds. the place was crawling with hikers, Alex showed up, I recognized That Guy and The Duchess of Slugs, Rocky Horror and Rippa, Baloo and Noah. There were lots of others as well. I met 3 section hikers from Cumming Georgia, where my brother and family live. Mission (he hikes really fast and carries a wooden staff with a pant leg for a flag) and his friend Cammomile (also very speedy), JellyBean, Pyro and Peanut Butter- 3 SOBOS that I have heard about but never met. I signed up for the evening shuttle to Walmart. Oh My God! Just too much stimulation, I didn’t really know how much food to buy for the Whites, so I bought everything, EVERYTHING. 8 days worth! YES, I am an idiot. Back to the hostel to chill and eat pizza. Rest day tomorrow, my goal is to find shoes and waterproofing for my tent, oh and to eat a lot.
If you are reading this, Do not buy 8 days of food for the Whites. Just don't do it. Keep reading and it will become clear.

Chores in Gorham  NH  mile  298.2       0 miles hiked
Breakfast at the hostel, 7:00 AM. Everyone assembles, totally worth it. They served coffee, juice, breakfast lasagna and toast in really big portions. People finished up and the day’s shuttles started. Some walked back to hike the trail, some were shuttled to south to Pinkham notch to slack pack back northward back to the hostel, 21.2 miles. Some went to Pinkham and were taking 2 days to hike back. Hmm, that sounds good to me. So, today I will take the morning shuttle to town for shoes and rainproofing spray and tomorrow I will shuttle south to Pinkham Notch. I will take 2 days to hike back to the Hostel. There is a shelter I can stay in 13.5 miles in (the Imp Shelter), so I will just pack a little food and my sleeping bag and pad. Light pack!! The next day I will hike back to the Hostel and spend another night. My first slack packing experience! The outfitter in town is actually an outfitter/hardware store. The owner only sells Merrrils. That’s ok with me, I have hiked in Merrils before and been more than happy. I get a half size up and I am good to go. I also find some spray for my tent. Back at the Hostel I eat some more and spray my tent. It isn’t really leaking, but in really hard downpours it little micro-drops come in. Maybe that’s normal, it isn’t really a problem since nothing seems to get wet but I thought I would see if it makes a difference. Now I can spend some time relaxing and try to figure out how to get through the Whites. Baloo is here and looks green, he has been sick at both ends and is contemplating going home to rest if he doesn't shake it in the next 2 days. 
Marnie and staff spend time disinfecting everything Baloo has touched!

slack pack day 1
Pinkham Notch to Imp Shelter    13.4 miles hiked north
Up for my breakfast at 7:00, a delicious breakfast burrito, hash browns, sausage, coffee and juice. I am very excited about carrying a very light pack to go over the Wildcats, Carter Mts., Mt. Height and Mt. Moriah. I will hike 8 - 4000 foot peaks over the next 2 days! Among the slack packers are Alex (now the Librarian because….she really books it on the trail!) Jellybean, Pyro, Peanut Butter, Mission and Cammomile. We pile in the shuttle van and zip to Pinkham Notch to start a northward trek over some really spectacularly steep mountains. Of Course our driver has to point out the trail head as we stumble around looking for it! I think everyone is doing this stretch in 1 day except for me. It is a beautiful day, sunny but with a crazy crazy CRAZY wind on top of the exposed summits. I stopped for a snack at Carter Notch hut and chilled out a bit by the pond. I am in no rush. It was really awesome to hike with my light pack. Such a fun day. I met up with White Gurl, Hooch and Big Tyler going south. It was nice to catch up with them. I caught up with Jelly Bean, Pyro and Peanut Butter and we had some fun on top of Mt. Hight leaning into the wind. The wind was so strong it held us up. It was very difficult to walk upright with the wind coming at us sideways. We all started laughing really hard, that wind was so ridiculous! All the summits were like that so it made for an exciting day. I stayed in the shelter, it was packed, I was happy to have gotten a spot since I didn’t have a tent. As it turned out, I could have hiked back to the Hostel if I had too. 
Slackpacking rocks!

Imp Shelter north to White Mountain Hostel      7.8 miles hiked
I slept well despite the packed shelter. I got up early and was hiking by 6:15. One climb up Mt. Moriah. I took the .1 mile spur to the summit and was rewarded with a magnificent view. The wind was still whipping today, just fine with me! The trail down became very nice and I zipped back to the Hostel, I was back “home” at 10:15. Marnie gave me a full breakfast left over from the morning crowd. I washed dishes in appreciation for that kindness. It was another serving of breakfast lasagna and croissant which I really did APPRECIATE! I had the whole rest of the day to relax, talk to family, eat and try not to worry about hiking the Whites. Tesla (Chris), White Walker, Jellybean, Peanut Butter, Pyro, Alex (Librarian), Mission, Grizzly (has a long red beard that is impossible not to notice), Camomile, and a few others are here tonight. 
I hiked these 4000 footers in the last 2 days:
Wildcat D, Wildcat Mountain, Carter Dome, Mt. Hight, South Carter, Mid-Carter, North Carter and Mount Moriah. WOW!
Thinking about carrying my heavy pack makes me sad now.

Pinkham Notch to Madison Spring Hut  mile 327.2        7.8 miles hiked
climb of 3336 feet to Mount Madison
Super excited about today’s hike! Up and ready to go before breakfast, everything is packed. Marnie served awesome blueberry pancakes this morning which I inhaled. I love this place and am sad to leave but I am going to Georgia! Can’t linger too long in one place. Be like a Rolling Stone. I soon learn that In the Whites you definitely DO NOT want to be a rolling stone. I forgot that the Presidential Range is a bunch of jumbled boulders piled on each other up to and beyond 5000 feet! So, No, no rolling stones thank you! I got on the morning shuttle with Pyro, Jelly bean and Peanut Butter to continue hiking south. The trail was generally nice up to the Osgood Tent site.  I stopped there for a breather, Pyro took out his pepperoni or jerky? and discovered that it had gotten moldy. I’ve never seen that happen to processed meat. Weird. I hung out with these 3 for a while. It was a nice sunny day and they decided to stay at the tent site. I was tempted but decided to press on and try for “work for stay “ at Madison Hut. The huts are posh/ rustic/ swanky bunk houses scattered throughout the Whites. They all have big dining rooms, toilet facilities with running water, gourmet dinners and breakfasts and bunk rooms. You can hike the Whites and go from hut to hut with just a day pack. The huts are too expensive for my budget. I do like them because if the timing is right you can stop and eat the leftovers. Any left over food needs to be packed out by staff, so they are happy to give it or sell it to passing thru hikers. Ugh, it took me all day to make it up Mount Madison, hiking on jumbled rocks on a steep pitch requires a great deal of concentration. I had to stop and admire the view quite often because this was some hard hiking. Most of the day was above tree line, that was fantastic. I got to the hut at 3:30 and asked to do work for stay, I was a little early but the hut person said I could do dishes after dinner. This meant that I could have left overs for dinner, do a little work and sleep on the dining room floor. I hung out at the hut and got into an interesting conversation with one of the guests. It was a little awkward later when he got to go in for dinner and I had to stay outside. I had a pre-dinner from my food bag. These people eat late! I never got my gourmet meal until 7:30!!! Chicken, rice, sautéed veggies and corn bread. Fabulous. I did my dishes and then had to wait until 10:00 for lights out to set up my sleeping bag. Some of the guests stayed up after lights out and played cards by the light of their headlamps. Ho-Hum!!! I am used to turning in at 8:00 at the latest. 
Maybe I will call it “Wait-for-Stay”

Nauman Tent Site    mile 339.0      hiked 11.8 miles
An incredible day. I am so happy that I can be a thru hiker. I got up before the sun came over Mount Madison. I had breakfast in the dark outside the hut and was on my way. I didn’t know when these people would be finished eating breakfast but I was sure I didn’t want to wait till mid morning. The sun popped dramatically and suddenly over Mount Madison and boom! Everything lit up with color. Awesome.  I was above the trees all day. Sunny with spectacular views all around. It is impossible to hurry because of the terrain, so I found a pace that I could relax and enjoy. Today I went up Mount Washington, a 6288 foot peak. It was hard work getting there, I heard the Cog Train as I ascended and saw it come slowly up the mountain. I was close enough to it as it crossed the trail to wave and see the faces of the passengers. I noticed many were pointing AT me. Up at the summit WOW, what a zoo of people, flowing out of cars, the train, just everywhere. There was a line to take a picture of the summit sign for goodness sake! I found an empty adirondack chair outside of the snack bar and settled down with a cup of coffee to people watch for a while. A lady and her husband strode up to me and said “You made it!” “We were watching you from the train!” they were incredulous that anyone would hike up this mountain and I don’t think they believed me that I started in Maine. I hoofed down to Lake of the Clouds Hut and had lunch, they gave me some left over corn bread, delicious. Then on to the Nauman Tent Site near the Mittzpah Spring Hut.  Again the place is crowded. I got a spot on a tent platform BARELY. There were 3 tents on this one platform. I shared space with 2 Northbound hikers and a Dad and son out for a vacation hike. Everyone was respectful of each other’s space and it all worked out. People were quiet by 8:00, Nice!
I watched a Northbounder make his dinner in a ziplock freezer bag. He didn’t have to clean his pot. I looked down at my icky grey water and thought, he is a smart guy. Maybe I will try that.

Stealth spot near Zealand Hut  mile 352.7    13.7 miles hiked
Outstanding day! I am going to need a thesaurus soon for more adjectives to describe my hiking days in the Whites. Early rise again, I noticed the other thru hikers were up and out early too. I had a beautiful day ahead. I had no firm destination. I have lost my fear of the Whites with regard to camping spots. There are enough water sources, stealth areas, work for stay and pay shelters around so I have relaxed about finding a place to sleep. Today I went over Mount Jackson, Mount Webster with  the long ridge that follows and descended down treacherous Webster Cliffs (SCAREY!) to NH route 302 also known as Crawford Notch. The views never quit. It was a slow descent to Crawford Notch for sure, then a slow 2000 foot ascent up to Ethan Pond shelter where I enjoyed lunch and a nap in the sun. I met Voyageur, a long distance backpacker who was leaving in a few days to hike the Pacific Crest Trail - again. He was day hiking and taking pictures of all the trail signs for his hiking club. After Ethan Pond, the trail flattened out and I enjoyed looking out over a deep valley beyond which is the Pemigewasset Wilderness area (Franconia Ridge) I could see Mount Guyot and Zealand Mountain. I motored right along and just before the demarcation of Zealand Hut “no camping” area I spotted a good camp spot off the trail with a good water source. It was a big area and I had the place to myself. For some reason I had trouble with my bear hang. The trees were tall and the branches seemed to be just beyond my ability to throw. It took a half hour! Finally I snagged a skinny branch and hoped it would hold the weight of my food bag. It dipped quite a bit but held up very well once I hoisted the bag all the way up. 
I got a little sunburned today.

Stealth near Garfield Pond       mile 363.6        10.9 miles hiked
No one came to my stealthy spot! I was up at 5:00, cooking a good breakfast and humming to myself -  because I could. I got underway at 6:00 and quietly hiked to the Zealand Hut. I could hear the Croo singing to the guests “Here comes the Sun, Little Darlin” to wake them up on this fine morning. I went up an 1800 foot ascent to the Zealand Mountain spur trail, dropped off my pack and took a quick trip to Zealand summit. - It is a 4000 footer, what can I say?  Next over Mount Guyot, with great views of Mt. Bond and South Twin. I hung out a bit and  line of hikers were coming down from Mt. Bond, singing at the top of their lungs! I love that! Now over South Twin Mountain and moving onto Galehead Hut for some lunch. I sat inside and had a peanut butter and m-nm wrap from my bear bag and got some left over blond brownies from the hut. Score! Slipping Jake - now called Funk Train, Honeybun and their friend Steeley came in when I was eating. It’s been a while since I saw them. They are really goofy. I don’t know how they get miles done, they REALLY LIKE towns. It was good to catch up a bit, they weren't sure what their afternoon plans were, I didn’t share mine because I wasn’t sure either.  I decided to get up and over Mt. Garfield today. It’s not a big climb but its steep and basically a waterfall. I enjoyed a long break on top, remembering when I backpacked here with Sharon. Well, I ended up hiking on and set myself up across from Garfield pond in a nice hidden tent spot. Had a great dinner, and was cozy in my tent early. Then I hear them, Funk Train and friends! They found my spot!! of course they ask politely if I mind sharing, no I don’t. They set up their hammocks and later share whiskey, and yep, it turns into a rather loud night. God, they are big goofs!!!!! Steeley was singing along with Beyonce at one point.  Not a horrible evening, just a bit lively, like watching an Appalachian Trail Reality Show starring Funk and Friends!

Kinsman Pond Shelter   mile 377.9       14.3 miles hiked
I did it! The entire Franconia Ridge and mostly couldn’t see a thing!!  The clouds were in and out but mostly swirling around my head all day. This was so cool!! I know I was missing a day of astonishing views, however I got to see big blobs of enormous cairns or rock walls looming in the blurred clouds, sometimes I saw just nothing but white, occasionally the clouds lifted right up and I saw forever for a few seconds. I witness banks of clouds rolling toward me and right through me, like waves on the ocean. It was a superb day for hiking the ridge. It was so beautiful I cried a little. I went over Mt. Lafayette, Mount Lincoln, Little Haystack Mountain, and took the spur to Mt. Liberty. I am really raking in the 4000 footers! I had my lunch (Yes, peanut butter and m-n-m wrap) at Liberty Springs Tent site, chatted with the caretaker. The White Mountains are very popular so the AMC has caretakers at the shelters and tent sites, there is a fee to stay. The money helps to keep camping areas/ water sources/ privies from getting ruined by the sheer number of people who hike the Whites. Caretakers also do a lot of educating people about the ecosystem and leave no trace principles. After lunch I hiked down to I 93 which is Franconia Notch and began a climb of 2335 feet up to Kinsman Pond shelter. Half way up I stopped at Lonesome Lake Hut for a snack, sat on a bench on the porch and enjoyed the view and listened to people. I also enjoyed the sitting, it’s not every day I get to sit on a real piece of furniture. It is very restful. There was a group of well dressed people enjoying wine and discussing politics and organic food preparation. Not the politics of organic farming but somehow they moved back and forth between the two subjects. No one looked my way, I think I looked a little too organic! I slipped off and finished the 1000 feet up to my shelter for the night. I elected for the shelter because I am expecting rain overnight and possibly all day tomorrow. So, I happily shelled out my 8 bucks and had a nice dry spot to sleep in. Nice crowd in the shelter and for once I was not old enough to be everyone’s mother! A group out for a short backpacking trip, sad about the rain but what can you do? I had my hot dinner, tuna and rice with cheese, yummy! and splurged with an extra cup of hot tea. 
A satisfying day on the trail. No bear bagging, the shelter has a big old bear box!

The Notch Hostel, Route 112     mile 389.4     miles hiked 11.5
This was not my plan this morning or even my plan when I reached Route 112. I got the best kind of Trail Magic today!!!  It rained overnight and was drizzly and rainy all day. I don’t mind the rain so I had my hot breakfast and hot tea and planned on hiking the Kinsmans, down to Kinsman Notch (Rt. 112) and up 1800 feet to the Beaver Brook shelter. It’s chilly so I actually put on my rain gear and start out. These Kinsman are crazy hard! North Kinsman and South Kinsman, you are BAD! difficult butt sliding kind of hiking up and down. Really slow going. After South Kinsman, the trail is really just a series of waterfalls, great more water!! I rested briefly at the Eliza Brook Shelter and had some hot tea and snacks. I had to get over Wolf Mountain and finally have an insane steep descent to the road. Jeekers!!! I cross the road to a parking lot where the trail continues as it goes up a steep trail to the Beaver Brook shelter. A young man is hanging in the parking lot, packing up some stuff into his car.  He introduces himself as Tugboat, a former thru hiker who was doing trail magic, making grilled cheese sandwiches for hikers. Just standing around talking with him I feel a chill sneak under my skin. I ask him if I get a spot at the hostel down the road, would he? - he says “of course!, give them a call and I’ll wait. I can get you to a hostel if this one is full”. Many thanks to Tugboat! Thanks to him, within minutes I was checking into the Notch Hostel!  Out of the cold and wet! I decide to take today’s nero and a zero tomorrow. This is a swanky place with very comfortable bunks, sheets, showers, laundry, resupply, kitchen, the works. I am in!
Jelly Bean, Pyro, Peanut Butter and Mission, Cammomile, are here as well as a large group of Northbounders and section hikers.

Super comfortable bed, make your own pancakes in the morning, never ending coffee. It’s nice here. I did some figuring for milages in order to be able to meet Sharon in Hanover soon. Borrowed a bike and rode to town for food and a little resupply, did laundry and ate. That’s about it. It’s raining so I am very happy to be here. There are a lot of North Bound thru hikers here. I listened to them trying to glean some information about successful thru hikes. This group (of young men) was mostly worried about going through the Whites and discouraged about the nosedive their daily mileage has taken and sick of the rain. There is no judgement here, I wonder if I will go through these same discouraged feelings when I am at mile 1700 or so. I did learn that I have just a couple of mountains to climb in New Hampshire and that they are easier that what I have been doing so far. Well, THAT’s good intel! I asked Peanut butter if I should buy a little deodorant before I meet Sharon and he said “Yes, definitely”. Hmmm, well you don't smell that great either Peanut Butter.

The sun is back and it feels glorious! What a great day to hike Mt. Moosilauke. I got up early to get the first shuttle to the trailhead. I made a bunch of pancakes for myself and anyone else. A couple of people headed north dug in and I hope my pancakes did a little bit to get their spirits up to “crush the miles”. The climb up is steep but it is beautiful, most of the time it runs next to Beaver Brook so its refreshing, lots of cascades and waterfalls. The water was gushing today. Pretty soon I am on a grassy broad treeless expanse of a summit. This is so GREAT!, The wind was doing its thing of course, making waves in the tall grass, kind of mesmerizing. Beautiful. I hung out up top, there were a handful of day hikers out and I chatted with a couple who were snacking on brownies. I didn’t score. After a time, I moved on, wow, the summit goes on forever!! I took the side trail to Moosilauke South Peak (4000 footer!) after a mile of open hiking, incredible! Then a slow gradual hike down to NH route 25, Hiker’s Welcome Hostel is just down the road but I decide not to tough it out and stay on the trail. (just kidding, I had no intention of hosteling it today). I continue on and decide to try to find a camp spot on Wachipauka pond, I see it on my map and it looks promising. I find a trail heading towards the pond and eventually land in a perfect camping spot, a small clearing right on the rocky shore! No one is here yet. I set up my tent, hang my bag and relax and swim. A loon visits. It’s awesome. Eventually 2 overnighters arrive and set up pretty far from my tent. 2 guys out for a couple days, they come over to get water from my spot because their shoreline is mucky.  They are pleasant enough, ask a lot of questions about the Appalachian Trail.  One of them has a Huge revolver on a holster on his belt. It has a white fancy handle and looks like it belongs in a western movie. So I am kind of weirded out about that. I am glad when they go back to their camp. I go back to my zen. Hooch and Heavy D? arrive toward evening and I am secretly glad to have them here because of the, you know, Gun, down the way. 
I heard crashing in the pond after dark, I am sure I missed seeing a moose.

Last night, I left my rain fly off. Every time I opened my eyes I saw amazing stars. Great time at the pond. Sad to leave. First, a climb up Mount Mist which wasn't bad and then flattish trail for the next 6 miles!I got a good pace going and enjoyed my surroundings. When I crossed Cape Moonshine Road (No, I am not making up names) I looked to my left and a bear was just stepping onto the road a comfortable distance away. We looked at each other, like 2 commuters nodding hello at a stop sign. The bear continued on his day as did I. My first Bear!!! I climbed up Mt. Cube and …Trail Magic! Oreos, Watermelon, Cheese and Red Pepper Slices! What an odd combination of goodies but who cares? Thank you Trail Magic Person! Beautiful view from Cube, I got so very excited because I recognized Camel’s Hump and Mount Mansfield in the distance. These are two of my favorite mountains in Vermont. I see them from the west  from my kitchen window, and they look the same from the east on Mount Cube. Ahhh, homesick again, but happy. I will be seeing family and friends soon! I hung out on Mount Cube for a couple of hours, Hooch, Heavy D and 2 others came and went. I finally pushed on down to Hexacuba shelter. Its built in the shape of a hexagon, its huge! A large group of NOBOs were arriving, I had to hurry up and scout out a good spot for my tent. The spaces were going fast! I’d say there were 25 people camped here. I was the only SOBO. One guy was wearing a full length cotton skirt, he said it was really comfortable to hike in. It was kind of cute! Most people were interested in stealthy spots to camp in the Whites and how to resupply. When they asked, I told them my experience and a couple took notes! Mostly I said, not to worry, and take your time to enjoy, the Whites go by so quickly! 
I saw VERMONT! My favorite state.

Kind of a warm day today, I carried extra water this morning because there is no reliable source for a 9 mile stretch. I am excited about getting to Hanover in the next couple of days. I am eating through my food bag and really need a resupply soon. AND Sharon is meeting me there!! First stop was an incredible view area, the Eastman Ledges. A family was there enjoying the sights- they gave me some fresh fruit!!! grapes and a large slice of cantaloup. Oh, Thank You Eastman Ledge Family, fresh fruit is always welcome. Always! Hooch, Heavy D and 2 others came and hung out. I listened to some mild mileage bragging and then the group took off. I was off to the view from the Smarts Mountain fire tower, the climb up the mountain was not bad, I am wondering if I am getting real trail legs. If I am, Wonderful!! I had more tantalizing views of the terrain to come from the tower. It looks flattish for a while. I noted a sign for Bill Ackerly’s house, he passed away earlier this year. He was known as “The Ice Cream Man”. His house is located just steps from the trail and he always kept ice cream for hikers. He really opened up his heart and house. He invited hikers to play croquet, take an outdoor shower, tent, relax on his porch, charge up phones- the works. He is greatly missed by the hiking community. His family has kept up his tradition for this hiking season. Thank You to Bill Ackerly’s Family. I spent a restful couple of hours sitting on his porch, in a chair (so appreciated!). Hooch and friends unfortunately had come earlier and gobbled up all the ice-cream that was in the outdoor cooler- bummer. Anyway, I chatted with a family from California who spend every summer on a trail. They have had lots of adventures all over the country. It was the first time I heard an experienced backpacker remark how extraordinarily difficult the terrain in the northeast is. I know it’s difficult, I am glad this is where cut my hiking legs, because although its hard hiking, I am used to it and the trail conditions do not surprise me or discourage me. To make the day perfect, I was able to talk to Sharon on the phone. Finally, I walked the .9 miles to the she shelter and to my surprise, no one was here yet. I set up my tent on soft pine needles on  perfectly flat ground. I found a little stream with moving water. Now will I have, tuna and instant potatoes OR tuna and instant potatoes for dinner? 
Definitely, tuna and instant potatoes for dinner.

Velvet Rocks Shelter  mile 440.7      15.2 miles hiked
I am camped 1 mile away from Hanover NH! The Velvet Rocks shelter is the perfect spot. I found a nice level spot for my tent. I walked 15.2 miles to get here, tomorrow I can get all my chores done in town so I don’t have anything annoying to do once Sharon comes to pick me up. I am stoked!!  I may just keep my tent here and stay tomorrow night instead of trying to find a reasonably priced place in town. I will think on that tomorrow morning. I was up and hiking by 5:45 this morning and the first thing I did was scare a bear! It saw me, turned around and shot away from me. What I actually saw was his rear end and then it disappeared in a flash. A few minutes later I scared a grouse. Grouse do not like to be surprised, they are loud and dramatic when they lift off and fly away. Sorry bear, Sorry grouse. I know I am in your house but I am just passing through. Last night, nature startled me, I was woken from a deep sleep by a loud spirited owl opera. I must have fallen back to sleep during an intermission because I awoke again for the second act. It was a hot day on the trail, I made it over the 3 Moose Mountains with a long break at the second for lunch. I think those are the last climbs for a while. I searched around for the spring at the shelter, its quite a distance from here and its kinda icky water. It’s collected in a box spring- an above ground catchment of some sort. I strained, filtered and boiled this water just to be safe. I was amused to read in the shelter journal that the Librarian (Alex) was going to stay here but couldn't bring herself to touch that “nasty” water, so she went into town. I arrived at the shelter at 1:45 so I had plenty of time to nap. Some NorthBounders showed up around 4:00. One guy had a small guitar, it was nice to lay around and hear music. I turned in very early because it looked like it was going to storm. WOW! it really kicked up a ruckus!! Tons of rain and wind, thunder and lightning. The storm passed directly over Velvet Rocks, I had a crack and a simultaneous burst of lightning right over my head. Holy electricity! All was well, but WOW, that was a big storm. 
Chore day tomorrow!

I survived the storm last night. That’s a good thing. I had just a mile down into Hanover so I slept in. I could hear the bell chimes from town and heard what I think was a sports practice. I decided to leave my tent set up and emptied out my pack except for my laundry. Pleasant walk into town. The trail comes out right at the Dartmouth soccer field and just past that is the Food Co Op and across the street is the Richard W. Black Center- that’s where I can shower and do my laundry. This is a nice set up!! First, Breakfast is in order so into the Co Op I go. What a blast! So much food! I got good coffee, a cinnamon bun, banana, 2 milks and a bagel. While I was eating Cyborg and his son, stoped by to say hi. I met them at the Notch Hostel. Always nice to see a familiar face. Next order of business is laundry and a shower. The Richard W. Black Center is Awesome!!!!! The people are so nice, there is a lounge and downstairs is a shower with soap, shampoo, towels and washcloths, washer and dryer. AND they have loaner clothes. How perfect is that? What a great shower, I found a flattering outfit and while I was putting my stuff in, Jelly Bean and Pyro come down the stairs! That was a fun visit with them, crazy kids!! The visitor center also lets you leave your pack as long as you pick up your stuff by 4:30. I had a great afternoon walking around Hanover, eating and people watching. I even got a haircut. I grabbed all my gear from the RWB center and bought a sub for dinner and climbed back up to Velvet Rocks for the evening. A different crowd tonight but just as nice. I met a woman who just started her teaching career as a middle school science teacher- so far she is pretty sure she is going to ditch the profession and pursue a science career far away from adolescents! We had some laughs about teaching. I told her I just retired from teaching and she said “oh, thanks, now I just I hate you!”

We spent a fun day walking around Hanover and then to a nearby town to a hotel where it is less expensive than Hanover. Air Conditioning is awesome, so is a large bed, and a whole bathroom. The best was being with a person I love. I get homesick every day. It doesn’t last long but I feel it every day. I am lucky to have a supportive family. They may not understand why I love this life but they would never try to discourage my dreams. For that I am grateful.

Oh no! I am getting very used to the comforts of civilization. Everything is so heavenly. Hiking the trail is pretty uncomfortable when I think about it. Even when you find a comfy spot on a mountain, you are laying on hard rock usually at some odd angle. At camp, there may be a picnic table and a bench, but it’s not like you are relaxing in a recliner. Using a privy is not the same as being in your own bathroom with the luxury of a full roll of toilet paper. No convenient faucet to get a glass of water, Oh how can I get back on the trail tomorrow! How? I just do. Dang it! I am an Appalachian Trail Thru Hiker. Dang it! Until tomorrow, I am going to soak up every luxury I can.

I am in Vermont, the 3rd state! 
19 days in New Hampshire
I had a great time with Sharon and appreciated 2 days off the trail. I will see her soon, I am hiking not too far from home for a while. I hope to see my dog too! We went to the Co Op so I could resupply and repackaged my food outside at the cafe tables. It was nice to have her company. She drove off satisfied that I am able to take care of myself on the trail and am in good health and spirits. I began my hike at the Co Op, walked through Hanover and over the Connecticut River. I was very excited to walk over that bridge, I had seen it in so many pictures and thru hike journals and it brings me into my favorite state. I stopped in the middle of the bridge for my State Line Celebration Snickers Bar, it was more than delicious! I had a surprise not too far into Vermont on the road walk, a road sign for Vermont Public Radio and King Arthur Flour. I know, weird, but I love VPR and bread made from King Arthur Flour. Continuing on the road walk, trail magic! I scooped up some rice krispie treats, thank you Trail Angel Who lives on the road! I stopped at Nazi’s for ice cream in West Hartford and a few steps down the road I noticed a house with an enormous AT sign and people hanging out on the porch. I check it out and Linda tells me to take a load off and have a soda and hot hog. There are quite a few North Bound hikers there going over their mileage. I have some snacks and to my surprise a van that I recognize from photos as belonging to Miss Janet pulls into the driveway. Yup, Miss Janet gets out of the van along with a few hikers that she slacked for the day. Miss Janet is a Trail Angel Above and Beyond who travels along the AT helping out hikers as they need it. I was just leaving so I just say hello, nice to meet you and was on my way. She is kind of a celebrity. I heard that That Guy and The Duchess of Slugs were at Linda’s place earlier, but I didn’t see them at the shelter. It wasn’t a difficult day of hiking, being back on the trail - nice.

Fairly easy trail today, Got up a nice and easy pace to go over rolling hills and gradual climbs. Strolled through some nice country today. At the edge of one field, Trail magic! Thank you!!! Bananas, rice krispie treats and PBJ sandwiches. That was really sweet! I took a krispie treat and ate a sandwich, signed the guest book thanking the trail angels profusely. Later, I stopped at then On the Edge Farmstand to relax and have a muffin and some yogurt. I chatted with the owner who was a former teacher. Sometimes I can’t believe I am not a teacher any more and sometimes I forget that I ever was! I noticed Miss Janet’s Van parked on the road near the Edge farmstand, I stopped to take a picture and felt like a stalker. I continued my easy pace, taking a detour to get water for the evening and morning from the source at the Winturri shelter. I had decided to stay at “the Lookout” tonight. This is an unofficial shelter that is a privately owned  cabin with a porch and a door and a lookout platform on the roof. The owners leave it open for hikers. There is no water source, so I had to carry extra, not too far though. I am glad I stayed here, it has an amazing view. Lots of hikers came and went during the afternoon and the place filled up with 2 north bound thru hikers and 2 weekenders. That Guy and Duchess of Slugs showed up as well. It was a good crowd.

Gifford Woods State Park   mile 485.8      14.1 miles hiked
My goal today is Gifford Woods State Park. I will stay there tonight, zero tomorrow and the following day my family is coming to spend the day with me before I get back on the trail. So its hike today, zero then nero. It’s a really cool Vermont Park just after passing Kent Pond and a mile and a half or so before the Maine Junction. That is the junction where the Long Trail continues north to Canada and for me, where I join up with the Long Trail going south to its beginning at the Vermont/Mass border. The Long Trail is 273 miles and runs up and down (literally) the spine of the Green Mountains. The LT/AT combine from the Mass border to just past Killington, a distance of 100 miles. People that hike the LT call themselves End to Enders and the LT has white blazes like the AT. Anyone mind a fun fact? The LT is the oldest long distance trail in the US. It was completed in 1930, the AT was completed in 1937. It is an amazing trail, it becomes very rugged and remote north of the Maine junction. Why and I gong on and on? I am an End to Ender! twice! I have a soft spot for the LT. Occasionally I will hear an AT thru hiker disparage and discount the Long Trail and complain that Long Trail hikers are crowding the trail, taking up all the spaces at shelters and in towns. One guy called an end to ender an AT Wannabee! I feel I must defend the Long Trail. It’s not an easy trail. If you want to experience how difficult the AT can get, hike the LT. I am ranting, sorry if I offended anyone reading this! You are probably thinking ok, ok the LT, I got it, amazing, oldest, mountains, ok, ok! enough already! So back to the day, I checked my phone going over Quimby Mountain and had signal, my hiking partner, Goat, had texted. She decided to hop in her car and meet me at Gifford Woods! AWESOME SURPRISE!!! I was 4.7 miles away and gazelled (hoofed it) all the way. Goat and I have been hiking together for years. We are currently working on her finishing the  ADK 46. I have missed hiking with Goat- a lot. I got to the park and there was her car, but no Goat, I texted and true to her fashion she had hopped out of the car and onto the trail, going south! She turned around and gazelled back. So great to see her, we took a walk on the trail, she drove me to Pepinos for flatbread pizzas, so delicious. I MISS GOAT! We hike really well together, I wish she could drop all of her real life commitments and join me on the trail for a while. But, its not the right time for her. She drops me off after dinner and about 5 minutes later texts and asks if I have anything good to eat for my zero day tomorrow, no, I have yucky bear bag food, Why? She comes back and takes me to a grocery store, now I have great food to look forward to. Thank you Goat for the visit, it meant a lot to me.

Family day today and they brought my dog!! Sharon, my mom, her mom and Bella my wonder dog. My mom brought a whole batch of home made snickerdoodles! I ate many, packed many and gave some away to the park rangers who have been so nice to me. We spent the day together driving around the area and ate at The Foundry. An excellent restaurant with a grand view of the Green Mts. It was great to see them all, after this I probably won’t see the mothers until I finish. I think my mom was relieved to see me healthy and uninjured, ok for me to continue on my trip. Thanks Mom. We drove back to Gifford Woods to take a walk with Bella and say our goodbyes. I exchanged some gear that I had asked Sharon to bring. I am hoping to see Sharon again before I get too far away from home. She is very supportive and has no doubts the I will finish my trip on Springer Mountain, Georgia. It was difficult to say goodbye. I felt a big let down after they left, that homesickness again. Nothing to do but hike on and I had the perfect destination in mind. Pico camp is a 4 sided shelter with a great view located about a half mile down the old AT from Jungle Junction. I have been there twice before and had the place to myself. Its too far off the trail for many thru hikers to consider. So I just hiked on. Eventually feeling better. I reached Jungle junction and zipped the distance to Pico in short order. As expected, nobody was there. I spent a nice evening drinking tea eating snickerdoodles and watching the sun set. Ready for more trail tomorrow.

I couldn’t resist having tea and cookies for breakfast. I ate most of them without shame. Hiked back up to the AT and took the spur trail up to Killington summit. There is a restaurant  up top but sadly, I was way to early. Its a beautiful morning and I took advantage of the outdoor seating to make some hot tea and oatmeal. I found an outside outlet and hijacked full charges for my phone and Delorme. I ate and lay down on a bench and fell asleep again, I woke from my own snoring! Still too early for the restaurant, so back to the trail I go. Its a good hiking day, rolling terrain with just a few climbs. I stopped at Governor clement shelter for some lunch and water. Steeley was there briefly, looking at his map trying to figure a way to get to a town for beer. I wished him good luck and carried on. Nice hike to the shelter with only one cling up Beacon hill.  Clarendon is a huge shelter with a fire pit, flowing stream and plenty of flat tenting spots. There were some overnighters, sectioners, a south bounder, Troubador? - he has a guitar and me. I set up my tent and went to cook and eat in the shelter, we were all surprised when a quick, strong thunder storm went through. It poured! thunder, lightening the whole show. In the middle of this a NorthBounder came running into the shelter. He threw off his pack with some colorful language. This was the 3rd time this week that he had been minutes from a shelter and had gotten dumped on. Yeah, I would be colorful too. He dried off and changed his clothes and apologized for his funky mood. We understood. I made myself offer him a snickerdoodle and felt better when he accepted it with a big smile. I slept with my rain fly on but my screen door unzipped to try to keep the humidity from feeling so icky. In the middle of the night, I woke and felt something on my leg and I really woke up when it jumped to my chest. There was a FROG hopping around in my tent! Now wide awake, I frantically try to catch it and get it outside. Success! It’s too funny and it takes a while to get back to sleep.

I was greeted by a deer this morning on as I started down the mini-mahoosic of Clarendon Gorge. A gradual climb lead up to a a ridge overlooking Spring Lake. Lunch and a rest at MInerva Hinchey Shelter where I once again met up with Steeley. I am not sure if he ever scored some beer yesterday. Today’s trail features a special attraction, the National Scenic White Rocks area. It’s SO COOL! There are two large areas that have hundreds of rock sculptures surrounded by pencil thin pine trees. Its quiet, beautiful and smells like Christmas. I spent a long time examining some of the sculptures, admiring how critically balanced the rocks are. I wonder how they hold up through a Vermont winter? On the way down Bear Mountain I met Chicken Feet who immediately told me he was 67 years old. I plan to still be a backpacker when I am 67 years old. He was on a mission going up as I was cruising down. As I approached Little Rock Pond I ran into a family and fielded a million questions from the kids, they were really enthusiastic. The oldest was most concerned about not taking a shower every day and having to use a privy all the time. The younger boy asked thoughtful questions about the environment and what I do specifically to leave no trace. I loved it.It was really nice to hear a young person who was concerned about land stewardship. A long but superb day of hiking in Vermont. White Walker, Tesla (Chris) and Flannel are here tonight.

I was up early and walking with the sunrise again. It’s just the best. I expect some rain this afternoon so I think I will set my sights on Bromley Shelter, maybe stay IN the shelter. I am meeting Sharon in Manchester tomorrow, Bromley puts me a short distance from Rte. 11/30 where I hope to get a ride into town to do all of my town chores before Sharon comes. That would be ideal. There are a few peaks to get over today- Baker, Styles and Bromley. They are all different characters. Baker has crazy vertical slabs on its summit, its like walking on up ended bricks that are not all the same height. Styles barely lets you know it has a summit, lots of trees up top having all sorts of conversations. Bromley is a ski mountain so you pop out onto ski slopes, you can be dramatic about it if you want and start singing show tunes. I didn’t but I could have. Bromley also has a ski lift-  he-he that means, time for a little nap right on a lift chair. You bet I took full advantage of THAT!  A good hike down to the shelter, looks like it will be a full house. I elect to stay under the roof as it had started to sprinkle. Let’s see if I can get this right, Tesla, Whisper, Whistler, White Walker (plays a guitalele!) Steely and North Bounder- Dreamin and a LT hiker - Spotlight, there were some others but I did not get their names. Crowded but not too bad.

I slept in a bit today. I had such a short hike to the road. I wanted to be there at peak ride catching time. (I really don’t know what that means. I just made up the concept). I was at the road at 10:00 and in Manchester at 10:45 ready to start my chores. Thank you Subaru Driving Vermonter! The first big chore was to go to the laundry mat, it had to be done, even my sleeping bag and liner. Manchester’s laundry mat has loaner clothes! That is AWESOME! Thank you Manchester Laundry! Right next door happens to be Mrs. Murphy’s Donut shop. Well, that is convenient. Naturally, I got 2 donuts and a coffee and sat on the nice bench outside in my spiffy outfit and relaxed. Manchester has a lot of tourists who come to shop and enjoy the Vermont Vibe, I tried to blend. It’s a little hard to blend when you are sitting on a bench with your best friend “stinky the pack”. After my laundry, took a walk around town, blending. I had lunch at Zoey’s deli, really, really good food. I had a veggie wrap and sweet potato fries. Heaven. Time to go to the grocery store for resupply, again, hard to blend when cart has, not a child in it but, “stinky the pack"". I finished repackaging my purchases and waited for Sharon. She showed up and whisked me away to the Bromley Lodge. I really appreciate Sharon, she is the best. We had a great time together chilling out, being tourists. Relaxed for the night at the hotel.

Sharon and I touristed around today. She took me to a quarry/ swimming hole that she passed on the way to Manchester. This was an enormous hole in the earth, a marble quarry filled with water. There were about 30 people swimming and diving in from really high vantage points. NUTS! Still a cool place. Vermont is/was? one of the largest marble quarrying places in N. America. I did not know that.  We also took a drive to see The Bill Wilson House in Dorsett. Yesterday we ate at “The Perfect Wife” Restaurant- cool name huh? We also ate at Zoey’s Double Hex Diner, another awesome place by the same owner as the deli in Manchester. It’s where I’ve eaten each time I hiked the Long Trail. Sharon dropped me back at the road crossing where I continued on but with less pep in my step. It is great to see loved ones but it also brings a real stab of homesickness. At least it does for me. I probably won’t see her again until I am finished. That is kind of hard to wrap my thoughts around. I don’t hike too far, just to the William B. Douglas Shelter where I set up my tent.

19.9 miles today. Really? It couldn’t have been 20? But who is bragging about crushing miles, heh-heh. My legs were independent from the rest of my body and decided to move right along. It was a hot, humid day so I drank a ton of water, ate a lot of snacks but felt pretty good all day. I found 2 beautiful springs on either side of Stratton’s summit. Kind of a hazy view from the tower and the care takers weren't around. Hmmmf, also lots of moose poop all around but yet again I see NO moose. This is my last state that I could stumble onto one of those big critters. The terrain was forgiving and it was nice to keep a good and steady pace. Hardly any people out and about. Kid Gore has a fantastic view, it sits up high and looks out into a valley. Its going to be a nice sunrise. There are limited tenting spots, One just down from the shelter, one past the privy on the side of the valley wall looking back to the shelter. Some other sites are further up the trail and have no view. I am in the shelter tonight because the 2 tent sites are taken. Granite State is tenting, I don’t catch the other tenter, my shelter mate is Fire Starter from Nashville. It’s a quiet but nice evening. Firestarter and I awake in the middle of the night to some kind of loud scraping outside the shelter. She got up and took a peek, it was a porcupine going to town EATING the outside of the shelter wall! She snapped a picture of the nocturnal diner and he left after one more big chomp. Some of the shelters have chicken wire around the the lower third and underneath to discourage the porkies. I know they love salt and there are warnings from other hikers in the shelter logs to keep your boots and hiking poles UP. You don't want to wake up with big holes chewed through your foot wear or have your hiking pole handles look like a chewed up corn cob. 
Granite State had a delicious dinner made with Stove Top Stuffing. I might try that next resupply.

VT route 9  mile 579.2    1.6 miles hiked
What a good nights sleep. The morning was fairly dry but grey clouds lingered in the sky. I have a short 1.6 mile hike to route 9, where my friend will pick me up. I have been away for over 60 days and miss my friend. I think this will be the last visit from home as I will be kind of far away for anyone to travel to meet me. It’s nice that they come this far. I get to laze around the shelter for a long while. It’s amazing how sleepy and lazy I get when I know I have time and short miles to do. I had breakfast and went back to snooze. It was a short fast hike to the road. There were 2 hikers trying to hitch and having a hard time, unusual in Vermont. Both eventually picked up rides. My ride came, as I ran to her car I noticed 2 north bound hikers coming out to the road and spotted my friend’s car. They started running. I said a hurried hello to my friend and quickly explained that in about 10 seconds 2 smelly hikers are going to run over and ask for a ride into town. They think you have just picked up a hiker-hitcher, Me! She has no idea of the position I put her in, picking me up at a trailhead. What was I thinking! My friend is a good sport and the North Bounders climbed in, expressing gratitude, filling the car with hiker perfume. My friend quietly opened all the windows. I hoped I didn’t still smell like Hell Hole Brook. We stayed at the Paradise Inn, really comfortable and right across from a cafe. Paradise! We are both coffee freaks. After a shower and wearing a clean tee shirt she brought for me, we hit the streets. Coffee at the Brown Cow, Stopped in 2 Russian Girls, Benington Pizza, The Bennington Museum, Grandma Moses and the Myron Avery Monument. I love Benington now, a big fan. We also ate at the Blue, a classic diner clad in shiny silver aluminum, booths and a counter. Nice. Why am I on the trail when I could just be hanging out with friends eating and visiting museums!? No, seriously, I still have all of my passion for the Appalachian Trail. It’s just nice to totally remove myself from it every so often.. 
Thank you to my best friend for a wonderful time in Bennington Vermont.

Ugh, a rainy hike to the shelter. I stayed in the shelter because….of the rain. I got a nice spot by the wall and curled up in my sleeping bag,  I am full of food and good memories from my towncation. No big climbs today except a short bit up and over Harmon Hill. Everything is very green and shiny. I don't mind the change of scenery from dry to wet after I acclimatize myself to the rain. Your eye pics up on different things, usually small things closer to you. A rock, leaf, neon orange fungi, the teeny tiny toad that moves in front of your shoe. I find rain puts me in a small bubble and I notice different things than on a sunny day. It’s crowded with sections and a couple of North Bounders. We all sit around and enjoy the rain. Nothing else to do

Wilbur Clearing   mile 600.6     17.1 miles hiked           
14 days in Vermont
I am in Massachusetts!!! The 4th state! I have hiked 600 fabulous freaking miles!! I left quite late this morning, not on the trail until 8:00. The trail was kind of flat and marshy with a half dozen or so half hearted climbs. The marshy areas were spectacular, I stayed at one, watching, watching for a long while. I think this might be my last opportunity to see a moose. It’s upsetting to me that I STILL have never seen a moose. Other hikers pity me, I can tell. Nice fast pace on rolling terrain. I took the time to check out Sherman Brook Campsites, they were a distance from the trail and buggy. Something creeped me out so I huffed it back to the trail. It wasn't long until I was at this shelter setting up my tent. Its a big tenting area so I had a lot of space to myself even though there were a lot of people here. After I went in my tent for the night, I could hear Troubadour playing folk and then some jazz on his guitar. Nice. 
I truly enjoyed my State Line Celebration Snickers Bar.

St. Mary’s Church Basement Cheshire Mass. mile 612.3        11.7 miles hiked
I woke early up to light rain, went pee real quick (do I really need to say that?) and right back to my sleeping bag. So unmotivated to pack up in the rain. Ick. The rain lessened to a drizzle around 10:00 and I reluctantly pack up, yucky wet tent, yucky wet food bag. I’ve decided to go to Cheshire and stay in the basement of St. Mary’s Church. Thank you to this generous church that lets thru hikers stay. Thanks to the Dunkin Donuts that is not too far away from St. Mary’s. The sun finally comes out and stays out at 4:00. Today’s hike went up 2 ridges and then up Mt. Greylock. There are lots of people up top because you can drive up there. It has an incredible view of the valley and North Adams Mass. Today, though, no view except for the clouds. I had a coffee and snack at the Bascomb Lodge on the summit, I sat in a uber comfortable leather chair and talked to some day hikers. Just hung out for an hour. The sun was coming out on my way down and out to stay by the time I reached the road. I stopped at the convenience store/ Dunkin Donuts and bought snacks and a sub for dinner. The trail goes right through a corn field on the way to town, a fun diversion. I set up my sleeping area at St. Mary’s and figured out how to use the outside shower, that was nice. I also spread my tent and everything that was damp out in the sun. Even rinsed out my socks. I noticed that one of my Darn Tough socks is getting a hole in the heel! That never has happened! I will see if the lifetime warranty is a real thing or not. Some other hikers came in later after I was in bed.
Massachusetts is very accommodating so far.

Such a great night’s sleep at St. Mary’s. It was a cool morning and I enjoyed it fully, hiking by 5:00 a.m. I was in the next trail town, Dalton, by 9:30. I got up early on purpose so I could spend some time in Dalton. I had a great breakfast at Juice and Java. I even read the newspaper and that made me feel very cosmopolitan. I had to skim the politics section because I find it truly horrific. I can’t even write about it. The gas station resupply- slim pickings, but I managed to find jerky and bagels, peanut butter, nothing too exciting. My guidebook indicated that I could take a shower at the Community Center and yup, it’s true. Very nice people there, they gave me a towel, washcloth, soap and shampoo. AWESOME! Hung out in the library for 3 hours enjoying the cool air. I read, uploaded photos and relaxed. I dragged myself out of town and hiked on to the Kay Woods shelter and set up my tent. It’s been nice to go through a town 2 days in a row. The hiking in Massachusetts is not bad at all, rolling hills some with views and some without. I am liking Massachusetts. 
Highly recommend the Juice and Java Cafe for a cosmopolitan experience.

Upper Goose Pond Shelter   mile 641.7        17.6 miles hiked
What a find! I had no idea about Upper Goose Pond! I kind of don’t want to say too much because I don’t want to ruin the surprise for anyone on the trail. All I will say is, take the half mile spur trail, its worth it. You will get PANCAKES! Excellent day to be on the trail, sun and a breeze, let’s get going! The trail remains fairly easy with some climbs, rolling hills (mountains?). The trail also passed by 2 wetland areas and a rural airstrip. I rested at October Mountain shelter which is a big fancy place with a loft. Finnerty pond was also a great spot to hang out in the shade, enjoy the water and breeze. I got to go over Interstate 90, which for me was amazing because I have driven under the overpass a gazillion times and always thought, “One day, that will be me on the Appalachian Trail overpass.” Today was the day! Upper Goose Pond is a half mile spur, I knew as soon as I saw the cabin that I would zero here tomorrow. It has everything, a clear pond with a dock, huge bunk room, outdoor tenting, the cabin is rustic-great stone fireplace. The caretaker is a volunteer, and went above and beyond to make everyone’s stay special. I picked out my bunk and went directly to the dock for a swim. There were many northbound hikers and 1 southbound hiker that I had met previously, Walking Tree. Walking Tree was from Germany and never took any kind of transportation other than his feet. If he couldn't walk somewhere, he didn't go. That is dedication to the idea of living on a footpath. I enjoyed his company and was glad to see him.

What a perfect zero day. The caretaker made blueberry pancakes and coffee for everyone. I can't tell you how much real coffee in the morning excites me. I usually drink tea because I just can’t deal with the coffee grounds and I haven't found an instant that I really like. The blueberries were compliments of a hiker who had picked a bunch the day before and left them with the caretaker. Thank you anonymous hiker! After breakfast, I went down to the pond for a very cold swim and then back to my bunk for a morning  nap. Lounging and lunch later, then just sitting the porch in a comfortable chair. A trail angel came in the early evening and made a huge spaghetti dinner with salad for anyone at the cabin. That makes 2 home made meals in one day. Incredible. 
A perfect day, not much more to say.

Tom Leonard Shelter    mile 662.8         21.1 miles hiked
Sunny day (yay!) with humidity (yuck!) overall a sweet day for foot travel. The blueberry pancakes gave me fuel to walk a big mile day. Massachusetts is full of medium ups and downs. Half of the “tops” have views of more rolling hills, farms, fields, woods, It’s really pretty. There are many more road crossings, however, they are back roads, not wide noisy interstates. Its kind of fun to step out of the woods briefly look up and down an empty road, so quiet,  and continue on. I like to look up the road on the map to see my progress and calculate how long it will take to get to the next crossing. Going up the ups, there is a familiar progression. First, from the road is usually a field with a wooden fence, then hard wood woods with stone fences, then a brief rocky field with berries or brambles, a section of short fir trees up to a rocky top, sometimes with a view, sometimes forested with softwood (birch, fir). I had many ups and downs today, so I noted this progression and appreciated it. Although I don’t like humidity (who does?), I am tolerating it. I am a little worried as to how I will get along if there is a heat wave. In my normal life, heat (over 75 degrees! starts to make me crabby) (humididty, ugh, ick, and HELP!) I can’t help it, I love the winter and am used to a short 1 to 2 weeks during the summer of being uncomfortably hot and sticky sweaty. The Tom Leonard shelter is around the head of a ravine and I almost miss the spur trail. There are people tenting and the really good spaces are taken. It seems to be a popular day hike and weekend destination. I find a nice level spot right behind the shelter. The water was a trek downhill but flowing nicely. I took a  wrong path back to the shelter and got turned around and found myself back at the water source! That’s ridiculous! I try again and see my mistake, the mistake of course is not paying attention in the first place. No biggie. As I was making dinner, two familiar faces appeared, Pringles and Mojo! so nice to see them, it has been a while. They have been traveling together for while, and having lots of cool adventures. Mojo has a knack for finding trail magic and trail angels that take them in to their houses, feed them, let them sleep in a nice comfy bedroom and basically pamper them and put them back on the trail all full and sweet smelling. I guess that happens when your trail name is “MOJO”
Good reunion with a couple crazy South Bounders.

Glen Brook Shelter  mile 677.1       7.9 miles hiked
Wet tent! What? I tented out in the open on a grassy field by the GB Community Center and woke up to condensation on the outside of my tent. Dang! The upside was that, if I waited for the sun to hit my tent, it would dry in a few minutes. Yup. I need to wait an hour or so. Breakfast! I bought a huge breakfast, coffee of course and ate it in the nice air conditioned Community Center. Maybe that was a mistake because my tent was long dry by the time I went to pack up. I noticed Speedo and Nemo were already gone. I packed and started my walk, passed by a McDonalds and decided to get another breakfast. Speedo and Nemo also had that idea and were chowing down some more super nutritious fast food. I chatted a bit with them and was on my way. I caught an easy ride to the trail head from a lady who had an interest in backpacking. I was the first thru hiker she gave a ride to. I hope I represented thru hikers well and that she will continue to be help foot weary travelers. What a beautiful hike today, hot, but ok. I had a long flat section and 1 climb to a ridge where I walked in sight of a beautiful valley for good while. There is an AT Head Quarters on this section, I don't remember the road but I decided to check it out. One of the employees gave me home made 3 bean salad and said I could hang out and eat at the outdoor patio. It’s a beautiful property, has water, shade and outlets to charge up the tech. It’s worth a stop. There was 1 climb of 1200 feet or so up Mount Bushnell, not to bad. The Glen Brook tenting area is beautiful. Right in a mature pine forest with little understory. the brook was running low, I had to follow it quite a while to find running water. To my surprise, this was an all women evening. The first time this whole trip, there were more than 1 or 2 other women! 2 sectioners- Mama Bear and Cub from NYC. They were hiking a section before Cub went off to college. Also met Faye from Atlanta, she sections every time she can. There was also a girls group camped a bit away from us.

Great Barrington, well it is a great town. I got to route 7 after a very pleasant hike, not strenuous but of course, HOT. A generous person picked me up and drove me right to the Community Center. This is another example of how awesome people and towns can be. The Community Center is air-conditioned and has a lounge area, free coffee and outlets. You can just stay there all day if you want. Also, showers for a little fee, a huge tenting area and its right near a large grocery store. Perfect. So, shower, set up my tent, looked for new socks that was a bust, resupply, not a bust, ate right at the super market and back to lounge in the community center. 2 Southbounders were in town, Speedo and Nemo. I don’t believe I had met them before. They said they were too stuffed to move. They had been to the super market and bought a roasted chicken. I mean chickens. They each ate an entire roasted chicken! and fixings! Speedo called me Ma’am. He said this several times, each time he spoke to me actually. I asked him if he noticed he was calling me Ma’am. Speedo- “Oh Insect Ma’am, you don’t understand. We are from Kentucky. If my Grammaw heard me speak to you without proper respect, well Ma’am, she would come slap me up side my head. From experience, it really hurts!”. Nemo- “Yes Ma’am, a slap or she would pull his ear off. My Grammaw too.” OK then, I don’t mind being Insect Ma’am. Nice evening in Great Barrington.

Goodbye Massachusetts  =  8 days
Welcome to Connecticut! State #5!!
Happy Birthday to my brother Ron! Today, I am planning to say goodbye to Massachusetts and hello to Connecticut. This is State number 5! This is exciting. I am feeling very charged today after a really good nights sleep. Another beautiful hike, what can I say? Of course it was HOT, not as humid though. The water situation is becoming a pain in the butt. Since the water sources have been drying up, I take time each day to read the fine print in my guide and Guthook (map app) comments about the water coming up. It’s also the first question asked when south bounders meet north bounders and vice versa. “How is the water coming up?” Trail Angels are leaving water caches at road crossings, sometimes there is a note in the shelter register or pinned to a tree about a cache up ahead. Anyway, I fill up and drink up at water sources when I come across them. So, I am carrying an extra-extra liter. Water is heavy. Massachusetts had the most vibrant and varied fern population. I was always coming around a corner to see a huge patch of ferns waving and swaying, like they were at a rock concert. Sometimes all of the ferns were still and there was one crazy fern whooping it up on its own. I liked that. I noticed as I am leaving Massachusetts the last 2 days my ferns patches are smaller and less frequent. Im going to miss the little guys. I climbed Mount Everett and Mount Race up to  Laurel Ridge (long with los of views!) and over Bear Mountain. I took a break at Riga shelter where there was a wonderful view of Twin Lakes Valley. Seems like I just had a State Line Celebration Snickers Bar and yet here I was devouring another one. Felt Great!!  I had a very quiet night at the Limestone shelter area which was enormous, a shelter and a large flat area with wooden tent pads. There was a group of 3 and a ridge runner. People were pretty subdued and kept to themselves. The campers had hammocks and they arranged them in a stack of 3 with one tarp. A stack of hammocks! I would not sleep in that bottom hammock. I had dinner, had the pleasure of rinsing in the tiny but flowing stream and off to bed. Nice day.
Good bye to the ferns of Massachusetts.

Raining buckets this morning, its warm though so I do not put on my jacket. The rain is good and bad. It cools me down and gets all the grime off my skin and clothes (mostly), but my glasses are hopelessly fogged due to the wet and humidity. They are also slipping off my face. I am a blind hiker no matter if I am wearing my glasses or not! Between the foggy humidity, rain and my glasses problem, I have a murky view of whats ahead. Things close to me are fuzzy and things down the trail are blobs of who knows what! It’s weird but diversionary at the same time. I am constantly amused to see what the actual blob is when I get close enough to see it. “That’s got to be a trail junction sign!, ah crap, its just a piece of peeling bark!” “Tail Magic?!!, CRAP, just a big square rock.” I meet up with Walking Tree around lunchtime at the Pine Swamp shelter. I was happy to see him again, nice to catch up on his adventures. Walking Tree is really laid back but when his gear doesn’t behave he lets out the loudest string of expletives in German that I have ever heard! He was packing up his pack from lunch and had set it carefully on the edge of the shelter. It teetered and then fell, spilling the contents onto the wet ground. WOW, Walking Tree let out a very long @@#%$^&***$#@$%$!!!!!!! I don’t know what he said but even I felt better after that outburst. Walking Tree will never have an ulcer.  The rain let up in the afternoon but the humidity persisted. I got some intel from northbound sectioners that the Silver Hill Campsite had water and was a sweet spot. After a long day of ups and downs, I reached Silver Hill. Excellent spot! Flat ground, a pavilion with 2 picnic tables, a hand water pump, deck with benches and a porch swing. oh and a view! YES!!! I set myself up, made my mashed potatoes with jerky and ate on the porch swing. I ate extra Little Debbie oatmeal cookie sandwiches (so good!) with my tea. Dry and relaxing. Another person came later, she was planning on hiking the AT next year and was shaking out her gear. We chatted a bit and I turned in early. Another good day on the AT.

Hot, Humid, Hot, Humid! At least I am not actually melting, I am able to hike despite all this hotness. My food situation is becoming alarming so I decide to take a short detour into Kent for resupply and hopefully to a cafe with air conditioning. It’s a couple miles from the trail. I am up early so I can get to air conditioning as soon as I can. The hike to Conn. route 341 (Kent is a couple miles down the road) wasn't bad at all. Around 10 miles from Silver Hill. Basically a few ups and downs, back road crossings then road walking a bit, a nice mile along the Housatonic river, that was really nice and boom! I am at route 341. It is HOT HOT HOT! I know, so repetitive, but it really is so hot. I start walking the road hoping someone will pick me up but nope, it doesn't happen. The first shop I come to, miraculously, is an ice cream shop with air conditioning! Well, I spent a long time in there eating my ice cream very slowly, sipping a root beer very slowly reading the newspaper very slowly. It was awesome! I dragged myself out of there and found a shop that sold Darn Toughs (socks) and bought an extra pair. It is so…..WARM, that I am changing my socks during the day and 2 pair aren't cutting it. I also find an air-conditioned restaurant and have a proper big lunch, chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries all eaten very slowly. Next, I resupply in the air conditioned grocery store and repack right inside the store. Ugh, I am not looking forward to going back to hike in the......oven. I decide to go back for ice-cream and dawdle until it cools off a bit, and just go to the shelter that is uphill from the road about .3 miles. That’s a plan I can live with and that’s what I did. As I walked the road I noticed grey clouds  and heard rumbling a bit by the time I got to the shelter. Faye (from Atlanta) was there as well as Mojo, Pringles and Orpheus whom I had not met until now. Mojo was wearing a wild tie dye shirt that said “God Loves Gays”, he said he was going to wear it specifically in North Carolina and Georgia, said with a sly grin!. Why? Well, I guess that is his story to tell. Pringles and Mojo had spent the previous evening at a Trail Angels house in their backyard swanky Cabana, it was really rich. That’s Mojo and his luck, I gotta give it up for him, he gets the good stuff. I set up, ate, visited and then we all scattered to our tents as the thunder banged and the down pour started. I slept very well.
I love air conditioning so much.

Connecticut  = 3 days
Welcome to New York, state number 6!
We had a flood of rain last night, I was looking forward to some cooling temperatures, however, I awoke to a steam bath. As the sun filtered in, I saw plumes of steam rise from the forest floor. It was beautiful to watch but sticky to feel. I got up early and waved bye to Faye who was emerging from her tent. Mojo, Pringles and Orpheus were snoozing still. There was an immediate climb up Mt. Algo. It wasn't  horrible and there were views of the Housatonic River Valley. Today, the trail teases me into NY for 2 miles and winds back into Connecticut  and finally back into NY to stay. NY, how dramatic! Down by Ten Mile River, at a road crossing I heard people sounds, perhaps this is a swimming area? Better check this out, I was rewarded by finding a beautiful swimming spot! There was a family with 2 young kids enjoying a dip, they soon packed up and I had the spot to myself. There was a wide waterfall, smooth rock river bank, pools and a deep area to really get some swimming strokes going. So perfect on this sticky day. I found a semi secluded spot, stripped and got in the water, I can’t express how amazing that felt. Amazing enough that I spent 3 hours hanging out, in and out of the water. I celebrated crossing into NY with a Charleston Chew Candy bar, I could not find a Snickers bar anywhere when I shopped in Kent! Although not the official celebration candy, the Charleston Chew was quite satisfying. After the refreshing swim at Ten Mile, the hike didn’t seem so horrid, and I enjoyed the views back to the Housatonic. I stopped at the Wiley Shelter and set up my tent, there were a few good level spots. Some North Bounders filtered in as well as Orpheus. One NB had a guitar and gave Orpheus some lessons in jamming. It was nice to lay in my tent and listen to their concert. Dinner was a disaster! I keep my lighter in my pot. I poured water into my pot as usual to boil it, as I reached for my lighter, it wasn't there. I usually take the lighter and put it next to my stove. For the second time this trip, I left my lighter IN my pot, drowning the poor thing. Ugh, it’s too hot for cooking so I decided to eat a peanut butter and chocolate wrap. It’s a good way to lift your spirits, chocolate lifted mine for sure! 
The jam session ended when big thunder booms moved in. Just a different kind of music.

I would rate today’s comedy factor a 10/10 and its overall difficulty a 9/10. I didn’t go very far but I really had to cut the day into short segments and get from point A to B and repeat. The big problem today, please don’t scream, the HEAT and HUMIDITY after days of living in an OVEN! Days of being so thankful that people cared about hikers enough to leave water caches at road crossings. I think I cracked. I drank a lot of water, but I would worry about the next water source being dry. UGH. The hiking was not difficult, up over one mountain and then up to a ridge with a view of Quaker Lake. I took advantage of “Native Landscapes Garden Center” offer to sit inside at a hikers table and chill out, charged my phone and texted my friend.  They also had an outdoor shower out back, a cold shower but who cares? I ask to use it and the worker said sure, back that way. Its a hose mounted to the back wall and a little cart to put your clothes etc on. It was Glorious, I lathered up. Then I heard it, an unmistakable train rumble, it got closer, I heard train brakes screeching, hmmmm, louder, the train noise was right behind me. I turned and holy crap the train is RIGHT THERE! so close I could see what the passengers were wearing. A guy with a coffee and baseball cap looked right at me! THE TRAIN STOPPED! I’M TAKING A SHOWER PEOPLE!!! I decide, what the hell, and turn around and continue with my awesome shower, these people must see naked hikers all the time. It’s a commuter train for gods sake. I forced my self back to the trail, in about a minute I cross the train tracks where there IS a train stop (heh!). I made it a few miles to West Dover Road, where the large Dover Oak stands. There is a water cache and a large box of energy bars, and shade from the Dover. This is nice. I sit. still sitting. I went down the road to a house with an outdoor spigot that hikers can use. I got there and it looks like no one lives there. I put my head under the water and douse myself. I go back and do this 3 times while I am resting by the Dover. I just can’t leave. A group of fresh faced people who smell like fabric softener arrive. They are from the city, took the train up here to walk in the forest. We chatted a bit, they had no idea of the AT. I hope I was a good ambassador. They took water and energy bars and left, thrilled with the day in the country. It finally cooled 1 or 2 degrees and I forced myself up a half mile and about 400 feet to this shelter. I found a semi-level spot to set up and collapsed. I fell right to sleep. 
Was I really naked in front of a bunch of commuter train people? or was that a dream?

Please Rain! Please Rain! Please Rain! Please Rain! Please Rain! Please Rain! Please Rain! I heard some promising rumbles of thunder a couple of times today. I want rain and I want someone to turn down the oven that has become planet earth! I hiked by Nuclear Lake, strode up to the shore, jumped in and jumped out, continued hiking in my soaking wet clothes. That’s better - for about 15 minutes. Crossed over Interstate 84, looking forward to a deli on rt. 52. I walk very determined down the blacktop road to the deli. Ahhh, nice inside, I get 2 root beers, chips and a large ham and cheese sub. There were No Whoopie Pies, so I was sad about that. There is a table in back in the shade and an outside spigot. Thank you Mountain Top Deli!!!!! This is a good place to linger, 2 sectioners were also taking a break and I enjoyed having some company. I tried not to complain about the SWELTERING ATMOSPHERIC CRISIS that I was having too much. After cooling down and fueling up, Hiked on under the Taconic Parkway and got to the RPH Shelter, used the outdoor water pump to douse my head- it was wonderful. The RPH Shelter is really nice, it has bunks inside and a table as well as a covered picnic porch in the back. It’s close enough to the road to order from nearby restaurants. I grabbed a bunk as the place filled up with NorthBounders, very lively crowd. It’s all right with me because I can sit back and its like watching a reality show! There was a 40 minute negotiation about ordering food and then a full critique of the buffet once it arrived. I cooked out back and this is the day my old faithful Pocket Rocket died. DEAD. It was so old that the threads for screwing onto the fuel canisters were stripping, making a tight seal difficult. Tonight, the flames were definitely shooting out the sides, below the burner. yeah, time to shut it down and give it a memorial service. A young North Bounder couldn't believe that Pocket Rockets had been around long enough to die of old age. I told him I have had my Pocket Rocket for 15 years and he gasped and I got the “Wow, you are really old” look. yes- it IS a look! It RAINED buckets all night, I slept a very happy sleep.
My Pocket Rocket, old faithful, flamed out for good today.

Greymoor Spiritual Life Center  mile 779.7    miles hiked 18.9
The rain last night, what can I say, I felt so much better today. I got right up early, very early so I had to be super quiet since I had slept in the shelter. It was still warm but I had a good breeze most of the day. Had some climbs today but not horrible. First up was Shenandoah Mountain, there were some good view of the Taconics. I passed 2 water caches on my way to Dennytown Road. I can't thank the people who maintain the caches enough. It’s one thing to put out a gallon now and then but these people put out 15 some times as much as 30 gallons. They also, from what I can tell make sure there is a supply of water every day. It really has helped. I took a clothes-on shower (sort of) at an outdoor spigot at the Dennytown Road. Is it weird that there are random outdoor spigots and hikers can just go and help themselves? I am a thankful hiker, thats all I can say. I took the .4 road walk to the baseball field at the Greymoor Spiritual Life Center. The Greymoor people let hikers tent here. There is a pavilion with ELECTRICITY, outhouses and an outdoor shower WITH WALLS. So I took a shower sans clothing this time. I met Szamauri Blue, another South Bounder. He was on a mission to get near his hometown in Pennsylvania, Waynesboro, I think. He was planning on staying at home and his wife, whom he missed dearly, would slack pack him while he was there. Also, a sectioner from NYC I believe, was taking a couple of weeks on the trail. Later a mother and daughter came and set up their tent. It seemed like the mother/daughter had been backpacking many times before this. They were exceptionally efficient.  They had everything set, hung up and were starting dinner in the time I decided what to have for dinner, potatoes and tuna or potatoes and jerky? My tent was in the shade, I had a good breeze blowing through, happy.
I go to bed clean!!

A new day! I got up early and was surprised to see Szamauri Blue already packed up and putting on his pack. He waved, I waved and off he went. I was excited about the prospect of going to the Appalachian Market just .5 miles from where I slept. I was there in no time, after I carefully made my way across traffic to get here. The roads lately are very busy and fast. The market has good resupply options and a good deli- specifically a breakfast sandwich, milk, coffee and 2 donuts. I sat at one of the high tables and watched CNN. Yesterday, I took a face plant. No reason, the trail was flat and soft, I just tripped over air and my cheek landed on the only pebble in the vicinity. I had a small bump and bruise last night but today It must look horrible. I say this because the people in the market looked at me in one of 2 ways, One: “Oh that poor dear has a mean boyfriend” or 2 “Don’t mess with that lady, I don't want to see the other guy!” I write this in all honesty, this is not to make fun of either situation. Both are violent and I dislike that in any form. I wanted to comment on how people perceived me with what I imagined to be a significant black eye, based on how they interacted with me and their facial expressions. I looked in the mirror in the restroom and Yikes! I had a black eye, cheek and chin. Nothing hurt, it was so weird. CNN was a mistake. I just can't take being inundated with all of this information. Especially when some of it seems like a political joke gone horribly, horribly wrong. Crossing the Hudson River was so AWESOME! what a beautiful bridge. I lost the blazes after the bridge and had to retrace my steps twice, but I did find myself in the Zoo. There were mobs of people. Most of whom looked at me and quickly looked away. (my face!) Past  the zoo was the state park on Hessian Lake, mobs of people here too. I did get trail magic from several groups of people- fresh fruit and ice tea. Most people just want to hear about the hike, and were super friendly. The hike up Bear Mountain was a breeze, Its a testament to every type of trail maintenance there is. It’s a beautiful trail up to the monument on top. I hung out in the sun, enjoying the quiet and an orange soda from the vending machine. Last part of the day was a ridge walk with views of the Pallisades Parkway. I went to West Mountain Shelter and NO water. I retraced my steps to a big rock that had a big clean puddle and filtered that for 1 liter. I was joined by Kun, a young man from Norway. He was visiting his sister who had an internship in Washington DC. He wanted to be able to spend days in the woods without coming to a town. So he researched this section of the trail. Kun said that there just wasn't that kind of experience possible in his country. I did not know that. We could see NYC skyline far off, beautiful. The thunder started and I got a gallon zip lock bag out, ready….Kun was short on water and worried about tomorrow. It POURED! I caught a full gallon from the roof and filtered it for him. He was amazed and promptly took a long drink that he could now afford to have. We watched lightning strikes going to NYC. Kun remarked “Maybe that lightning hit Trump Towers!” (he-he) We had just had a very funny political discussion. If only you could vote Kun!
I was around more people than I have been in months. I had a hard time getting to sleep.

After the big rain last night, the humidity left. Such a relief!! I watched the lights of the city and the heat lighting for a long time last night. Kun left about 8:30 and I just could not get moving. Kun said he woke up in a big panic, he knew he heard a bear growling! He shined his light out into the dark with trembling hands and heard the noise again. HA! it was just me, apparently I snorted-snored! He was kind of disappointed but at least he had the real FEELING of having a bear in camp even if it was just a fake out snoring person. Sorry Kun! It was so peaceful, nice breeze, great view and warm but not humid. I never left the shelter until 10:00. That’s crazy, but oh so nice. I did some lazy hiking, I stopped a lot to look around at, …oh anything. I read in the shelter log that the visitors center in the median of the Palisades Parkway had an outdoor spigot and there were snacks to buy inside. This was really, weird, I walked out of the woods and then walked down the side of a busy highway to a small building in the middle of the lanes. Pleasant surprise, air conditioning and the person working was very hospitable and let me charge my electronics and stay as long as I wanted. So I did, for 1 and a half hours. Since water has been so scarce I now have a collection of water bottles. My liter bottle that I drink from, two - 1 liter bottles and two 3/4-liter bottles. Jeekers, its a lot of weight, but its hot and I just can’t rely on the water sources listed in the guide. Its hard to pack all these bottles, I keep 3 inside my pack. Generally they fall out every time I open my pack and roll down the nearest incline. Such a pain! Ok, I will quit my complaining! Today was very pleasant, I slept late, sat in air conditioning for a while, saw 2 deer in the woods, saw the mighty Hudson River from above, good day on the AT. The Finger Board Shelter sits up on the side of a hill, I am tenting below the shelter in a tall pine forest. I watched the sun set behind the ridge where the shelter is. Nice. 
The Pallisades Parkway Visitors Center, quite a find.

Today may be the last full day in New York! I have heard promising things about New Jersey and I am stoked to move on! Up then down then up then down and repeat that ALL day. That sums up the topography for today. My thighs and butt got a workout for sure. The lemon squeezer was a bunch of fun maneuvering, not too bad at all. I like a good boulder puzzle. Good water caches all day, water angels really rock it this year. I stopped at Fitzgerald falls for a while, it was relaxing to sit by flowing water, it has been a long time. I have switched out my lunches from peanut butter and m-n-m wraps to tuna fish and wheat thins, eaten like party snacks, of course some m-n-ms for dessert. The problem with crackers is that it is very easy to eat more of them than your supposed to. A wrap is a Wrap, when you have eaten 2, that’s it. I don’t count crackers. Today, I only had 4 crackers left. Sad situation… Indeed. 
My tip for the day; count your crackers, avoid the sad.

I did not plan this day well. I got up early as usual, and in 2 miles I was at NY Rte.17a. Its 7:00 in the morning. Right down the road is the Bellvale Creamery and Hot Dog Stand! A CREAMERY!! I go there hoping, really hoping it has a devoted organic egg eating early morning crowd and that they are actually open for business. ARRRRGGHH, it’s not open until noon. Noon? Thats in 5 hours. I look in the window, the place is classic creamery. I bet the ice cream is probably the best, better than Ben and Jerry’s. At the outdoor spigot, I fill up my water bottles, because I have to. Just another sadness, yesterday with the 4 cracker lunch, today a no cracker lunch and no Bellvale ice cream. I have to do better people. I carry my sadness to the trail where I get to walk a long ridge looking down at Greenwood Lake. I see a boat. I bet that person has crackers and some creamery products in the fridge. Reaching the NY/NJ State line does a great job lifting my spirits. I have a mangled State Line Celebration Snickers Bar, a family sized bar, and feel very happy, state number 7. I hope hiking the AT isn't giving me mood swings. Within a mile of entering NJ, I see 2 bear cubs scampering away, so I see their rumps basically. I am aware that Mom is near, I look but don’t see her. I am hoping she is in the direction I saw the cubs go and not in the direction that I am going. Bears, first thing in NJ! Cool. The views are beautiful, woods and lakes and the hiking isn’t too bad. Crossing the Warwick Turnpike raised my blood pressure a little but soon I was at the Wawayanda Shelter. There was no water at the shelter but I had carried what I needed from the last source. It was nice to take the pack off. I found a great spot for my tent, stuck my crackerless food bag in the Bear Box and relaxed reading the shelter log. A good first day in NJ. 
I regret not sleeping in today, I would have been able to have the worlds best ice cream.

Town day! I must do something about my sad food bag, my rank clothes and me, I am filthy! I head out for NJ Rt. 94, near Vernon NJ. It was a very pleasant walk with just a couple ups and downs and one downhill of about 700 feet. I caught a ride almost immediately, Thankyou!! My driver knew exactly where the church was and took me right there. He also pointed out the super market and post office. This church hostel is fantastic! Laundry, lounge area with cots and comfy couches and recliners, a nice shower room, a hiker fridge and use of the kitchen sinks. There is a list of chores, and you are expected to pick one and do it to help keep the place neat and clean. No problem, I mop and clean the shower room. It’s early, so I get my resupply done and get cream cheese, tomato, avocado and tandoori for sandwiches and whoopee pies for my delectables today. Laundry is done and I get to the P.O. and mail some stuff home, and mail out a bunch of post cards. Its nice, I relax all afternoon, no one else comes along until late. When I first arrived, a father daughter ( 10 yr. old) team and their dog Balto were packing up and getting ready for the trail. The daughter was excited about walking the board walk. She was a whiz with the days itinerary, she recited the landmarks and milages perfectly. That is a good hiking partner to have. There is a notice that hikers are welcome to attend church and can get a ride back to the trail after the service. Its Saturday, so I decide, sure, I will go to church tomorrow. What a nice afternoon, relaxing in a recliner, doing not a whole lot. A young guy came after I was sleeping, he made a bit of a ruckus, but I was able to get back to sleep. The service was outside in the garden and it was pretty cool actually, very informal. I learned that this would be the last year for this hostel because the church was being sold, it was a done deal. The church people had known about this for a while and were moving on, sad, but resigned to the fact that this beautiful property wasn't theirs anymore. A parishioner (former teacher) gave me a ride back to the trail and we had a good conversation about our respective careers.
I really enjoyed my stay in Vernon NJ.

What an amazing surprise NJ is! It’s beautiful. I have a nice breezy morning, the hike starts off through a field and then the Pochuck Creek mini valley floor on an extensive boardwalk. I passed 2 ladies out for a walk and heard one say “Oh my there is so much dog doo!” I wanted to turn around and tell her it was not from dogs, it was bear poo. But that may have startled her and I didn’t want to ruin her day. There WAS abundant bear poo!  There are several minor ups and downs, I like the shortish scrubby pine trees. I stop at the Pochuck Mountain shelter for lunch and I have plenty of crackers. I have switched my mid day tuna for pepperoni, it is quite tasty. Next on my itinerary is the Wallkill National Wildlife Refuge. New Jersey really knows how to do up wetlands! I loved this area. The trail feels like a straight berm in the middle of a perfect marsh. Beautiful plants in bloom, I saw egrets, blue herons, and a raccoon. The rest of the hike passed through fields and crossed roads and had the occasional road walk. I was looking for a tiny sign that said “water” just passed a gravel drive way after Unionville Road. I almost missed it! There is a grass drive to the secret cabin and I found it! Jim Murray owns a farm and has a piece of the property open  to thru hikers. There is a shack (its NICE) with electricity, an outhouse and an out door shower with hot water. What could be better? I will tell you, meeting Mojo, Pringles and White Walker again!! They were traveling together, got here in the morning and just couldn't leave. Fine with me! It was great to hang out with them once again. They were so intent on getting a pizza, but still follow the rules, that Mojo ran to the nearest road crossing to meet the delivery guy.  White walker ordered a whole liter of soda to go with his pizza. Crazy kids! They packed out the pizza box/soda bottle of course. We  watched a deer family come out of the woods and eat dinner in the field, the smallest deer ran around like crazy. Just happy to be a deer I guess. Later we were visited by 2 donkeys that live at the farm. Very very friendly donkeys. Good day on the AT.
Happy to see some of the old crew again.

High Point HQ NJ Rte. 23   mile 853.5       7 miles hiked
You never know how a day will turn out. I intended to hike far, farther than my 7 miles anyway. However at some point today I noticed a sign on a tree advertising a new hostel called Moseys. Thoughts of a shower, electricity, food kept flashing into my head all day. I gave in, I called Mosey in the afternoon for a pick up at High Point Park HQ. Score! I was having a very slow day anyway. In the morning, there was a lazy lowland hike, a couple of hills, a pond and pastures. More lowlands and a half hearted attempt at a climb onto a ridge. It was all very beautiful though and I stopped a lot just because it was such a nice day. The ridge had occasional awesome views. I hiked to what I thought was High Point, the highest spot in NJ, elevation 1803 feet. There was a wooden deck and an observation tower, it looked official. There I met up with White Walker and Mojo. We looked backwards and saw land higher than where we were, dang it! there was a side trail a little ways back, I should have paid attention. Mojo and I decided to go back and actually stand on NJ High Point. I am glad I did, fantastic views and an awesome huge stone tower.  Back at the wooden tower, I waited with the boys for Pringles who was “just a little behind”. Then we noted that the food concessions at the High Point State Park would be open in about an hour. Why not just wait? So we had snacks and waited for Pringles and the concessions to open. Pringles finally arrives with a park ranger who has hiked the Pacific Crest Trail. So of course that lead to a long discussion about that trail. The concessions finally dictated that we go down and eat up a bunch of food. I had a burger and fries and a soda. The crew had similar nutritious meals. The crew just couldn’t get moving so I headed out finally, made it about 15 minutes and called the hostel. Mosey told me to be sure to get my free soda at the Park HQ, thanks for the intel Mosey! She came and brought me back to her house which is serving as the hostel. I got a bunk, laundry and pretty much the run of her house. By the end of the evening, Daytona - a south bounder whom I had not met yet, Tyler (friend of Honey Bun and Funk Train), White Walker, Mojo and Pringles all ended up at Moseys. Tyler cooked up a mean chili for everyone and Mosey made a great big breakfast the next morning. 
I like how this day turned out.

I wasn't expecting a full breakfast at Moseys but that is what we got. Everyone was up by 7:00 or so and we enjoyed a big but leisurely meal. I took Mosey’s first shuttle and was hiking by 9:00. I hiked a bit with Daytona, who is French and lives in Florida. She is a professor at ……I don’t remember the university, but she teaches something complicated about computers. She told me but her words floated above my head. Our paces didn’t match up and after a while we hiked separately. I am sure I will see her again. The day is quiet, mostly hiking up to a ridge, (not big climbs) and walking on the ridge for a long time, then down to a wetland or road crossing. The miles go by quickly, I am kind of in a zero thought mindset and its very pleasant. There is a large pavilion on top of Sunrise Mountain, I sit a long while and eat some snacks. I do the same at the Culver Fire Tower. There is no water, ugh, I was happy that I packed extra but unhappy that I HAD to pack extra! There is a restaurant/tavern about 4 miles before my shelter, Gyp’s I think was the name. Stopping was a no brainer since, it was right there practically in the trail. I met 2 sectioners who didn't make it far because of all the enjoying they were doing at the tavern. It was peaceful to sit outside in an Adirondack chair and slowly drink a rootbeer. The shelter area was large, 2 large groups were tenting. Not sure if they were family groups or a church group. I tented near the shelter. 2 Sobos were staying in the shelter, Pretty Boy and Lost and Found.  Also Buns and Day Hiker showed up. Quite the crew of Southbounders were represented at the shelter. 2 teenage girls walked by the shelter and asked Pretty Boy where the garbage was located. He informs them there isn't any, its carry in, carry out!? They hadn't heard of that. Pretty Boy can't stand that! Then some other people ask him if the outhouses are working. He makes a comment something like if you can GO then, yes, they are working!! Kind of funny because the people did not get the inference. I made a mental note of where the blue blaze trail down to the water was. I decided to do that chore in the morning. I listened to some hysterical stories from Pretty Boy and Lost and Found until I fell asleep.

Pretty Boy had a big day planned for himself, getting all the way to Delaware Water Gap, over 24 miles! Well, he just graduated from high school and has high school muscles. I saw a figure in the dark in the morning leaving, he nodded and was off. I wanted to get as close to Delaware Water Gap as I could today. DWG is in Pennsylvania!! and the trail goes right through town. I plan to stay at the Church of the Mountain Hostel. But I can’t hike over 24 miles…..yet. My decision to fill up my water in the morning was a grave mistake. I ALWAYS fill up the night before. It was dark, I had to use my headlamp, the blue blazes to the water source don’t show up well in headlamp light. I got to the water source after loosing the trail 3 times, only to find it dry, I noticed more blazes and got to the second source, DRY, finally I noticed a surveyors tape and went there and beyond and finally found a small spring. Ugh, I had taken off my hat somewhere and lost it. I became really turned around trying to get back to my tent, no one was up so I couldn't even see a random headlamp in the distance. In the end, it got light enough that I recognized a few features and sheepishly got back to my tent. 45 minutes to get water!!! I will NEVER put off the getting water chore again! Newbie mistake. The hiking day turned out very nice, lots of ridge walking, gravel roads another fire tower. I stopped at Catfish Tower for lunch and was entertained by a Penn State Orientation Group. They are all nervous and not trying to show nervousness at all. Like they have already done the whole college thing. The views are endless, New Jersey looks so flat and it really is. The elevation changes are minor, mountains consist of 800 foot climbs and that is for the MONSTER NJ mountains. However for having so many wetland and pond areas, there is very little water. I am going to need yet another water bottle. I stopped at Sunfish Pond and enjoy the hundreds of rock sculptures at pond’s edge. I met a family out for a day hike, we chatted a bit. I didn't get any of the snacks that they were munching, but I did get the now familiar “you are by yourself???” and the crazy look that follows. “yes, I am”  - awkward looks - I’m thinking, why? are you going to gang up and take my smelly pack, moldy wraps and sweaty cheese?”. I think not. Backpackers campsite is awesome!! It is huge and flat, there is a privy and a bear box. It sits up on the ridge with a great view of the valley, that night I can see town lights. The family walked by and the Dad sends his son to do something with a bag at the bear box. After they leave I put my food in the box and discover that they put their GARBAGE in the bear box. That’s upsetting. What a horrible example for the kids. Do they think a garbage truck comes by once a week? If Pretty Boy were here, he would have taken the garbage and hunted them down, yelling “ITS CARRY IN, CARRY OUT!” I have to shake off my annoyance so I can enjoy the view and solitude, no one else but me here. 
You bring food on a hike, its in some sort of container. You eat the food and now the container weighs a fraction of what it did with the food. Why is it so difficult to take the now empty container home and put it in your trash? Sorry, I was really peeved. I will pack out the stupid garbage.

Town! Town Day People! I am up early, packed, shovel a breakfast bar and hit the trail. I will have a proper breakfast in Delaware Water Gap. Beautiful cruising downhill mostly, to Kittany Point Park. I cross above Interstate 80, terrifying amount of traffic even from the safety of the walkway. As I walk through the park, it becomes clear that I will be crossing the wide Delaware River on the bridge that is Interstate 80. What? That’s a long bridge with tractor trailers flying by at a constant rate. There is no other way. I tucked my head and proceeded, it was really scary and loud. Every time a truck passed, which was every 5 seconds,  I was quickly pushed back and then sucked forward. Then Poof, it was over and I was in Pennsylvania on a quiet street in Delaware Water Gap. I found the hostel and collapsed on the first couch I came to. I sat on the couch for a while. It was awesome. People were just getting up. It was a surprise to see so many Southbounders, more came during the day.  Pretty Boy, Durham and his dog Ridge, Calvin and Hobbes- I last saw them in Maine I believe! That Guy and the Duchess of Slugs. Buns and Day Hiker. Hmmm this is nice. At some point I shower and find the Apple Pie diner and have an enormous breakfast and read the paper. Wandering around, I find a store with some gear and buy a Platypus 4 liter water carrier. It has a handle and looks like a clear purse. So I name it my Water Purse. Now I can ditch 4 of my 6 water bottles. Resupply options are a gas station or the gas station across the street. I chose the first. Back to the hostel and veg out. Back to the diner for dinner and do not order the Scrapple. I had scrapple as a kid and its one of those dishes that you really do not have a clue of the ingredients. Animal, vegetable, table scraps? Its impossible to tell. 
Great day in the Gap. I decide a zero is in order for tomorrow. I go to sleep right away, full and happy.

This is the first zero day in 19 days and it feels like a snow day off from school. I learn that the church has a dinner tonight and the hikers are invited. Home made food? Oh yes, I am going to that, even though I am not a social gathering type of person, I am a food gatherer for certain. I will be charming and engaging and that will get me some good eats. It’s all very exciting.  I venture out briefly and slowly to buy snacks for the day and eat again at the diner and read the newspaper. Speaking of the newspaper, WHAT IS HAPPENING?????  I have to pretend that the newspaper is a pretend newspaper and put it back on the counter. Many hikers come, stay and go throughout the day as I sit on the couch. I really am quite fond of all these familiar faces. Calvin and Hobbes have constant conversations about life and society in the theoretical sense. They usually recognize when sense is turning into nonsense and stop before the theoretical world catches fire and burns into theoretical oblivion. I like them. Calvin’s Mom came to take them to Walmart for resupply and brought 2 home made peach pies. They were gone in about 5 minutes. She was worried that she forgot plates and forks. Plates, forks? Those pies were inhaled, vaporized without any kitchen conveniences. Plates- get serious! Daytona showed up and went to do laundry and graciously took mine as well. She got a ride from someone on the ride board at the Hostel. White Walker, Mojo, Pringles showed up, they really make me laugh. With them was Stumbledwarf, whom I have never met but had heard about on the hiker gossip line. He is very direct and has an outrageous awesome beard. It’s really eye catching. I sense many men must feel envious. Tyler was there waiting for the local bar to open. Even Walking Tree!! I was so happy to see him, I shouted and I think I startled him. Duchess of Slugs was waiting for That Guy to come back from a 17 mile stretch he had missed because he was sick. Another hiker, Wild Card Ninja, stopped by for a nap before she continued on. She was on a quest to set a speed record. 2 others were tenting but I didn’t catch their names. The church feast was incredible. These people were so nice! They made the hikers go first in the buffet line, that’s kind of crazy because of the amount of food we eat. I talked to 4 people and ate 4 plates of food. 
An incredible day off.

Quite a satisfying day. Hiking early, I got to climb 1000 feet up to a ridge where I spent most of the morning. The view to the south was the Delaware River Valley, a large wide scoop, very pretty, impressive. The landscape is very different from the north east with which I am familiar. Stopped for some water at the Kirkridge shelter and met up with White Walker for a bit. Then back to trucking the trail. The trail crossed 2 electric line swaths. Pennsylvania electric line swaths should have a different name. Perhaps “Dynamo Alleys”. The power towers and cables are HUGE, science fiction huge, like something Ray Bradbury might write about. Looking at the straight swath cut as far as I could see, I could imagine these huge electric monsters marching across the country and nothing could stop them. They made other power lines look like 2 cans and a string. Really, really big with loud buzzing, I felt like I shouldn’t dawdle and crossed the swaths pretty quick. Hiked down to Wind Gap where there was trail magic in the form of soda and sweets, the note was from some hikers that I had briefly met in New Jersey. Thank You!!! Promptly hiked back up to a ridge 500 feet. Consulting my topo map, I noted the trail crossed a buried a gas line. Hey, I could have been electrocuted or blown up by gas today! It didn't happen. HAH! Pennsylvania seems very industrial so far, Electric, Gas, Trains, Trucks, it’s a work horse of a state. I arrived at the shelter, set up my tent, walked about a half mile to get water and relaxed. White Walker showed up undecided about moving on, I watched him get more and more comfortable and he decided to stay. Achilles is next and finally Walking Tree. Walking Tree sets up his tent without the need to swear in German. I am a little disappointed. 
No stubbed toes today, I hope my luck continues.

2nd Tentspot past George Outerbridge shelter mile 935.3     19 miles hiked
Rocks Status- Mostly Moderate - requiring more than usual foot concentration, feelings of aggravation, some cussing possible. 
Also a short span of Treacherous-  Requiring complete concentration and wall hugging spider like skills. A cold sweat may break out after footing has returned.
OK, how long is Pennsylvania? 250ish miles? ugh. Well, I am just going to do as many miles as I can every day to be done with this state. I have decided. Most people will tell you to slow down in PA because- Rocks, hmmmm, I am over it, I am going to get past these sneaky pointy unreliable ROCKS as fast as possible. This is bad, I am complaining already and from what I understand, I haven't  even gotten to the horrible rocky parts yet. 
White Walker and I were leap frogging all day, thank god. I would get annoyed with the terrain and then I would see him up ahead with his easy going, nothin’ botherin’ him stride and I would feel better. Thanks White Walker!! Today covered miles and miles on a ridge. Sometimes the trail was just below the slanted rocks that made up the ridge, at times I was walking on the slanted rocks, sometimes the trail went up and over the ridge rocks and back, east side then west side. I carried a lot of water, why? because…no water on the ridge. The views however were of big scooped out valleys on the west side and one very wide flat valley with ripples and small hills on the east side. The views were really pretty. Toward the afternoon, the trail goes over Blue Mountain, kinda creepy area the had been contaminated by zinc processing. It’s in clean up mode now and has been for 30 years. Still creepy. The vegetation is stunted and unvibrant. I could see the Lehigh River from up top. I was coming around a corner down a slope and back into the woods and I run into White Walker. He had stopped and was eating with a group of Korean people. They hike a lot and were out for the day. They had chairs and a huge spread of food! The men were giving White Walker everything, I don't think he knew what he was eating.  The women started giving me food too! This makes up for the terrain for sure. I ate sushi for the first time, and some kind of pickled fish, a vegetable dish that was super spicy! How cool was that?! Thank you so much to this very kind group of day hikers! The next mile was down a smooth slab with an occasional rock hand hold all the way down to Lehigh Gap over the river. Holy spider moves! I had no idea that was on the docket for today! I got to the bottom and saw White Walker sitting on a log, wait, he held up a can of soda?! Trail Magic! So so so good! we had a couple of sodas each and Little Debbie snacks and applesauce. 
We are good to go now, across the bridge and up to the next ridge. we got to the shelter and decided it was yucky. we decided to check out campsites along the ridge. But before we got going we filled up all of out water containers possible because…. no water for a long time! So a long day that ended well, Korean food, water and a grand view. Just me and White Walker here tonight.

Eckville Shelter mile 957.2      21.9 miles hiked
Rocks Status- Hard Core Combo-  all manner of rock terrain, changing at any moment. Small pointy, large unstable slabs, slanted smoothies, grabby jumbled boulders, trails to nowhere, resulting in a draining fatigue and perhaps some non-family friendly outbursts. 
Up early and hopeful for a great day in PA! Even though it turned out to be a Hard Core Combo Rock day, I didn't let it turn me grumpy. It was 10 miles to Rte. 309 where there was a restaurant with an outdoor spigot. So ten miles of weirdness, It's really difficult to describe, Rocks of all kinds everywhere and they are sometimes jumbled on top of each other and see saw when you step on them. All sizes, sometimes you squeeze between boulders and sometimes you crawl over them. Sometimes the trail is just like in a nonsensical Dr. Seuss book. It makes no sense! Weaving sharply north, south then north then west and you have gone 1/4 mile. I think Pennsylvania said, ok, AT people you can have this corridor, no one else wants it. The AT people thought well ok, lets make this an unforgettable challenge. It worked, I will never forget PA.  I approached the Route 309 restaurant and saw White Walker and Stumbledwarf. We had lunch, chatted, filled up on water and I left for the trail, Stumbledwarf left to find a ride into town for a beer and WW was getting ready to leave. As I entered the woods I heard a loud BOOM! I thought someone had run into Stumbledwarf! I ran back to the road to see White Walker running to the road with his phone calling 911. 2 cars had collided. Stumbledwarf was just fine and was with a person who was trapped in the car. We stayed until the police came and took our statements and got people into ambulances. Stumbledwarf was just a little hopeful to catch a ride into town in one of the ambulances! Incorrigible Brit, he is!! Some excitement! Something to think about when I was avoiding thinking about the rocks. Finally the trail went down off the ridge and to a short road walk to the Eckville Shelter. This shelter is in someones backyard, it’s a big converted shed and there is another shed that has a shower and flush toilet. Also charging stations! Across the road is a big tenting area. White Walker is there, all jazzed about getting pizza delivered when a section hiker notices a sign that says “NO PIZZA” I could tell he was momentarily crushed. Achilles showed up and we had our trail dinners and set up across the road. 
A big adventure with traffic. Saw a deer.

PA Route 61  mile 971.7      14.5 miles hiked
Rocks Status: Boulder Que - long continuous stretches of thigh high boulders, jumping, crawling, and surfer like balance skills required. Some grunting may occur. 
The trail looked like all the boulders came out of the forest and were bunched up in line, in little conversation groups. Like they were waiting for voting pols to open or something like that. Or maybe waiting to get tickets to the long awaited Rock concert. HAHAHAHA , hmm I might be loosing it. The trail continued to do its boomerang route and I dealt with the rocks. There were 2 view areas, The Pinnacle and Pulpit Rock. Both were east facing and had beautiful views of the valley, farmland. The rocks must start at a certain elevation, they just can't be in the valleys. There is no soil up here to grow crops, only rocks. There must be perfect soil in the valley, it all looked so nice, green and smooth. It has to be different down there .Why is the trail up here? I had passed an area with a random huge pile of rocks, a man made pile about 10 foot high. Did the trail workers start to clear the trail of rocks and throw them in a big pile? They must have seen it was futile and gave up, leaving this odd gigantic cairn. The trail did a weird turn here and I circled the cairn a couple of times before I got it right. I stopped at pulpit rock to rest and dream about re-routing the trail down into the valley. White Walker and Achilles show up and take off their packs. Someone mentions rocks and we all snort. White Walker and Achilles had thought of a great idea, getting a hotel room in Hamburg. Hamburg is a substantial town near the next road crossing. It’s expensive but if there were 3 of us……. Oh i am in! I made arrangements and we hiked on. Achilles and I walked the road to the hotel. Route 61 is a big highway, and we pass big shopping plazas, big Walmart, Pizza Hut, Gander Mountain, all the big players are here. White Walker continues a bit to Port Clinton to pick up package. The room is nice, 2 beds and a little sleeper sofa which I claim. Achilles and I walk to the laundry mat and have pizzas and soda delivered there. The laundry mat is in the REAL Hamburg, a cute downtown that had once been prosperous. Half of the businesses were closed, the big players had sucked the life and money out of this downtown and that made me sad. Achilles is a young man, long long beard. He was working maintaining satellite towers (I believe) and decided one day to hike the trail. He is quiet but really funny in a deadpan way. Back at the hotel, White Walker is relaxing, munching away on snacks. I decide to resupply tomorrow in my way out at the Walmart. So I go to the nearest gas station to get my snacks for the evening. There is a knock on the door and it’s Pretty Boy! He is just down the hall. He stayed and visited for a while, it was a fun evening away from rocks. 
Hotels, are nice.

Eagles Shelter   mile   981       9 miles hiked
Rocks Status: Consistent ankle rolling terrain, requiring concentration and nimble maneuvers. Leaping skills required. 
No one snored last night. I woke up refreshed, went immediately to the continental breakfast, loaded up and brought my feast back to the room to have breakfast in bed. My roommates were just waking up, Pretty Boy came for a morning visit. Its plain that no one will do big miles today. We paid for this magnificent room till 11:00. Reluctantly everyone went on their way. I had my resupply to do and Achilles asked me to pick up a comb, he lost his and apparently that’s bad when you have a beard. Walmart, so so big. So big. I picked up supplies and remembered the comb. Back to the road and soon I am in Port Clinton. Huh, I have been here before! I remember my Grandpa, Dad, Mom and my Brother being here at the Train Museum. I was maybe eight or so. This is so cool! I take time to walk around the old refurbished engines and read the history information. I notice the big cliff just past the train tracks and think that is probably my trail. Yup. Back to climbing, up to a ridge and the DANG ROCKS! I must have better skills and these rocks are a bit less horrible because I am only slightly annoyed. I reach the shelter and it looks like it might rain so I decide to shelter it tonight. White Walker, Achilles, That Guy, Duchess of Slugs, Pretty Boy and me all crammed in the shelter tonight. That Guy and Duchess of Slugs stayed at the Port Clinton tent area last night and went to the local social club where they found Mojo. He was at the bar, when he saw That Guy and Duchess apparently he yelled, “HELP ME!!” “PLEASE, OH THANK GOD YOU ARE HERE” yes, poor Mojo was very drunk. Duchess and That Guy made sure Mojo was ok, thats what friends do. Then they tell stories and laugh! Not a bad evening at all.

Wm. Penn Shelter  mile 1000.2       19.2 miles hiked
Rocks Status: Not  Completely Miserable with occasional short stretches of 10 feet with no rocks. Staring at your feet is still required. Lifting spirits during the no rock parts.
Misty rainy morning but cool and breezy. Today, I have been 3 months on the trail. That’s ridiculous! I love trail life so much and am looking forward to the months to come. I am especially excited about meeting my sister who will be hiking with me the last 120 miles or so. Her trail name is Free Range. I am able to clip along fairly well today, feeling some relief about having to concentrate a little less and its cool and its breezy and I will have hiked 1000 miles by the end of the day! I stop for lunch at the 501 shelter and there is White Walker. He is debating wether he should stay at this shelter until the pizza shops open. You can have pizzas delivered here. He is hemming and hawing.  I don’t know why, if there is any chance at eating pizza, I know White Walker will not miss it. I assumed thats why he stopped here in the first place. We met Topher and his dog Al, a former thru hiker and got some god advice and stories. WW decides to wait and get his pizza (big surprise) and I hike on. I see a fox, and 2 deer on the way. I reach the shelter and find Pretty Boy eating his 3rd ramen of the day? Later he eats almost a whole jar of frosting. Anyway, I decide to tent and go back to the trail to the tenting area. There is a non-talking person in a hammock who is smoking a cigarette. Gag. I tent away from him. The water source is questionable. Its yellow and smells. Gag. I have 2 liters and pass on this source. I failed to notice the first time but right at the trail junction with the shelter someone had put rocks that spelled out -  1000! Wow, it is truly unbelievable! I think:
ONE THOUSAND MILES!!!!!
Wait, I have been hiking 3 months and only covered 1000 miles?
there are over 1000 more miles to go……
WHO CARES! I JUST WALKED 1000 MILES!!!!!

Rocks Status: Minor with stretches of moderate. Conditions favorable for loosing concentration resulting in injury. Best to keep sharp.
Nice. Nice temperature, no bugs and the rocks didn’t seem so horrible today. I was able to keep up a good rhythm and it felt great. Stopping at the views, the landscape looked like a gigantic hand spread its fingers and raked out enormous straight scoopy valleys. The ridges were pretty straight and came to skinny slabby pointed lines. Beautiful to look at those valleys. The trail went under Interstate 81 and trail magic!! Clark was set up with his car and folding chairs making grilled cheese sandwiches! How wonderful, Clark was a former thru hiker who was supporting his girlfriend and was slacking her today. That means the he drives and drops her off, she hikes with a day pack and he picks her up later down the trail.  So while he waited he decided to do trail magic. I sat down and had a birthday grilled cheese, chips and soda. (today is my birthday and I am 57 years old!) soon Pretty Boy comes along and then White Walker. I finally take my leave and continue a very pleasant day. I was able to zen (think about nothing). I decide to walk until I find a beautiful tenting spot and call it a day. My choice was a bit off the trail, had a sunset view, good bear bag tree and a flat tent spot. Nice. I got set up and lay in my tent with the fly off. One by one I saw the crew go by, no one saw me! It was awesome! I knew they would camp a couple miles up the trail and I would see them soon. 
I didn’t hate Pennsylvania today.

Rocks Status: Dinosaur eggs, piled one on the other with a scattering of huge pointy shards. Probably some negotiating with your higher power will help.
It’s a funny thing. The rocks are back but they are uniform in size and shape. My legs adjusted and handled them very well. I minded the rocks but they didn’t come close to pushing my grumpy button. I cruised, it felt really nice to get into a good pace and be able to look around a bit. Nice breeze today. I was up on a ridge all day except for one 700 foot foray down to the valley floor at Clarks Summit Road and a couple of other minor blips. Then it was straight back up to the long ridge. I stayed about 700 feet above the valley for the rest of the day on Peters Mountain. The terrain is more like enormously tall long land ripples. Not a typical mountain I picture in my head. It is kind of cool at the view points to see an endless long ridge followed by another ridge off to the west and east. I have driven through PA a bazillion times and noted huh, ridges. But this is a different beast being able to experience a different topography, geology, flora first hand (first foot actually). I especially liked looking down at a huge man made resevoir- Delhart Reservoir? and at the Susquehanna River snaking along down there. Got to the shelter about 4:00 and found water only .1 miles away, Nice! No one was there, I set up my tent and had a quiet dinner and rested in my tent before bed. Always good to rest before sleep! Around 6:00, a ton of people came. Well, maybe 10. I didn’t recognize any. Thats ok, if they are SouthBound, I am sure they will pass me tomorrow. I will say, howdy, tomorrow. 
Love the Pennsylvania land ripples, saw 3 deer.

Rocks Status: clumps of hard lumps and bumps. Ripe for toe stubbing. Dang it!
Alright then, 4ish miles into town (Duncannon) today, resupply, eat and back out to the woods. That’s my plan. It’s a good plan. I slept late today and took my time, the people had gotten up early and vanished. I got to hiking around 9:00. The ridge was not bad and I had just one steep decent of about 1000 feet to cross the Susquehanna and Juanita rivers on 2 bridges. From my vantage point I could see Americas Transportation; highways, interstates, train tracks, waterways. Yesterday I also crossed over a Dynamo Alley -  huge electric pathway. I’m telling you, nothing better happen to Pennsylvania because I think all of the power would go out, natural gas would leak out and away, food would not make it to grocery stores far away and certainly Target and Walmart shelves would be bare across the land. I feel like I see part of the country’s heart chambers beating away, creating pulse down there. Looking at all this industry stuff I keep thinking of Carl Sandburg, Chicago. Except it’s Pennsylvania-
       BIG mover for the world,
       Tool user, stacker of boxcars,
       Keeper of traintracks, river roads and America’s long hauls;
       Electrifyer, fuel tunneler
       Humid, rocky, glacially scarred   
       State of industry and flow.
I probably should not bastardize a famous poem, but, I never had a poem become alive right in front of me before. I need to compose an original poem about the toughness of local economy and renewable energy. Not today. Nuff of that, I saw Stumbledwarf ahead on the road into Duncannon and ran to catch up with him. We decided Breakfast! and ate a giant one at Goldie’s Diner. Stumbledwarf if you ever read this thank you for buying me that breakfast! Off to a convenience store for a small resupply and icecream. Stumbleswarf has a military background and is from Britain, he is terribly interested in our military history. He is thrilled to see our tributes to America’s military past. We stop at a memorial for the Armed Services before leaving town. Stumbleswarf gave me a history lesson about the civil war about battle strategies. I had no idea. Its getting very hot, so we hoof it back to the woods where there is some natural air conditioning. There is a bit of climbing to the ridge and soon I am at Cove Mountain shelter. I get set up, there is a spit of a tent spot and find the water. Stumbledwarf shows up and later a Ridge Runner, PJ. We had a great evening NOT talking about the trail. All subjects from A to Z, excepting “trail”.

Rocks Status: Cumberland VALLEY! Rock Free! Happy Feet.
I watched Stumbledwarf eat his Fruit Loops, dang, they looked good. There is a bit of chatting at breakfast and then I am off to the trail. The heat has returned, but it’s early and I see on my topo that I get to walk over a couple minor ridges and then through the Cumberland Valley. FLAT! I reach a lookout place and meet a family up there enjoying the view. They tell me to be careful because today is a real scorcher. There is a stone bench built into the rocks, it faces the valley and it is beautiful. I am excited to descend and walk in the corn fields. The trail goes right down and then it really is flat, really goes by cornfields and big fields of soy and beans. There are a lot of cows as well. Sometimes I walk on roads, sometimes on trail or right on the edge of fields. No rocks, lovely. I do notice that it is getting very, very hot. My pack is heavy because I am carrying my full water purse and 2 liters. There is one water stop but its miles away. The guidebook warns about drinking water from nearby streams as they may be affected by farm runoff. A guy was out jogging, his name was Charlie, a long distance Trucker. He  said that he stops to run every day and has certain places on his routes for running. That is very cool! He asked to take a picture of us together, he said it’s a portrait of a true thru and a true trucker. OK then! I reach the ATC run Scott Farm around lunchtime and it is burning hot in this valley! I drink up a lot of water and eat, basically hide in the shade. The Duchess of Slugs and That Guy are here. Clearly as hot as I was. They were thinking of hanging out here until evening and night hiking because it will be cooler. There is no place to camp until Boiling Springs, 11 miles further. Reluctantly, I go back out in the heat and slow up my pace so I can enjoy my environment without sweating into a puddle. I enjoy every little breeze that comes my way, I get to cross train tracks, dirt roads, highways. When there is shade, I walk under it and its sweet. I think the heat wave a while back helped me condition for today, I was uncomfortable but didn't feel drained or overly tired. Finally, around 4:00 I reached Boiling Springs at the AT regional headquarters. This is a very cute town, I hang out at the AT HQ, enjoying sitting in a chair for a long time. Afterwards, I enjoy a dinner in town and make my way to the Backpackers Campsite at the edge of town. AHHH, no one is here, I set up and take my rest before going to sleep. 
What a great day!!! Valley walking is very cool, but oh so so hot.

“BREAKFAST!” I am startled awake. I open my eyes and see Stumbledwarf standing in front of my tent. “COME ON MATE!” He turns and starts walking to town. ugh, He really IS military, Anyway, I am happy to see him and throw my stuff in my pack and hoof back to town. As I leave camp, I notice Duchess of Slugs and That Guy as well as another dude came sometime last night. They are still snoozing.  I find my British Alarm Clock at the cafe enjoying his British tea. I go for the coffee of course, and pancakes with bacon. He is on an adventure of his own that includes making his way south on the AT, other nearby trails and roads. He has many maps and plans out his routes for the upcoming sections depending on where he wants to go and what he wants to see. It is kind of awesome. Today, back to the rocks and ridges for me. There was a mini boulder maze that was pretty fun, it had arrows all over pointing the best way to get through. Humidity added itself to the mix. Back to sweating. It’s ok though, I had pancakes and I think I will hit a deli right before the shelter I am going for. So I am good. I appreciated being back in the woods, its easily 10 degrees cooler. The trail winds through woods with some ups and downs, its quiet. I like it. When I came to Pine Grove Road, I saw Stumbledwarf walking up the road! I get his attention and we go to the Deli. Its all I dreamed of. I am in love with air conditioning….and food. White Walker and his friend Gandalf, who has joined him for a fun week on the trail showed up. It’s a nice reunion! The shelter is just a mile up the trail and we go to set up. There is a big orientation group from Princeton, thankfully they are camped down the hill. As the afternoon turns to evening, Stumbledwarf, White Walker,That Guy, Duchess of Slug, Gandalf, Bent, Wilson Wilson, Day Hiker, and Buns all are here.

Rocks Status: Annoying x ten, 2 feet to the left or right of the trail looks so soft and rockless. Do the trail people put the pointy devils on the trail on purpose?
Leisure morning, I could feel the heat even before I moved. Whew, really hot and I haven't even done anything. I mentioned that I was thinking about running back down to the diner for breakfast. White Walker perked up, his friend Gandalf said to go for it, he wouldn't mind hanging out a while longer. YES, we actually did kinda run down the hill. What a great way to start the day, the diner owner was really nice and made a mean breakfast sandwich. Full of good food, we went back to camp to start the hiking part of the day. I started out and instantly felt the humidity like a wall of steam in my face. The trail went up gradually but UP none the less, so I paced myself and was happy when the trail leveled out. I knew I had a gradual downhill until Pine Grove Furnace State Park. I had a de-ja-vue feeling at the entrance to Pine Grove Furnace State Park and definitely as I walked by the river. My grandparents had taken my brother and me here when we were kids. I remember I ate too many Keebler Fudge Striped cookies and puked later that night. Too much information? Sorry… I piddled around in the AT museum in the park, oh the Air Conditioning, That Guy and Duchess of Slugs were there as well. I chatted with the staff, who were either former thru hikers or section hikers. When I went back outside I realized just how awful the heat and humidity were. I stood there drenched in sweat feeling really heavy. White Walker and Gandalf, Slugs and That Guy were going to stay at the Iron Master’s Hostel a stones throw from the museum. I thought that was a smart idea and made my arrangements. We walked across the lawn to the “store” (closed!!) and found Stumbledwarf working away at his computer, thieving a charge from the store’s outdoor outlet. Stumbledwarf has a box of stuff - computer etc, that he mails ahead to himself to various places. So he can work on his charity etc. He has been working here all afternoon. Off to the Iron Masters for much needed respite from the outdoor conditions. Nice place, pizza dinner, pancake breakfast, comfy beds, showers and laundry. White Walker’s uncle came to take him and Gandalf out to dinner. They came back with pints of ice cream for everyone! Relaxing night.
Watched a wild thunder and lightning storm from the porch.

It’s bad when your anticipated breakfast is waffles and you aren't even disappointed when you are served Eggos. I ate them and was happy. A little procrastinating at the hostel, then took off into the heat. The trail was not actually that bad, I could cruise right along. There was an overall elevation gain, the day started at 900 feet and at some point I was at 2000 feet, gradual ups and downs. I noted some crazy big rhododendrons, I did not know they could grow twice as tall as me. Very cool. I couldn’t miss the half way sign, heheh. It looks like a crazed trail junction sign, waving flags and everything. I stared at the sign and felt like a thru hiker, so I hiked on, with a smile! Met up wth Slugs, That Guy and White Walker for lunch at a shelter. I have gotten so used to hostel food and deli food that I almost forgot how to make my tuna wrap. Well, back to thru hikin’, I set a comfortable speed and let my legs do their thing. I reach Quarry Gap Shelter, its in the middle of a forest of those gigantic Rhododendrons. The shelter is very fancy, there are two shelter rooms separated by a covered dining area . The sleeping areas are clearly marked, “snoring” and “non-snoring” I set up in the non-snoring side. The crew shows up and we watch a college orientation group try to light up their stoves. Should we help? hmmm, we smell the isobutane as it is shooting out of the canister and back up. Thank goodness, the guy turned the valve off and no one lit a match. Eventually, they got it right and cooked up fajitas. White Walker, Duchess of Slugs and That Guy move on and it’s Stumbledwarf, a sectioner, the Princeton Kids here at the fancy spot.

Falls Creek tentsite mile  1124.7      20 miles hiked
Rocks Status: Unchanged, Challenges of all sorts. I think Pennsylvania will continue its rock assault until the very last mile. Chin up, only 2 more days of PA.
The heat wave continues. I get used to sweat pouring off of me just like I am in the shower. Except it is salt water. Ick!!! I was gross after 5 minutes of hiking and stayed gross all day. Caledonia State Park was not too far into the hike, I rested and had 2nd breakfast, got water and topped off my phone charge, the bathrooms had outlets. I watched people come to walk their dogs, jog, or just come and sit to drink a Starbucks coffee. It’s nice but this isn't getting any miles done. Rocky long ups over Rocky and South Mountains, enjoyed a view at Chimney Rock, I am only about 400 feet above the valley floor. The landscape has lost its sharp ridges and scoopy flat valleys. Its flatter down there with small bumps, lumps, and streams. God! its so so so so hot!!! I had lunch at Tumbling Run Shelter(s). Great place with 2 shelters. I watched an Outward Bound group arrive and discuss how to set up their camp. Most of the kids were enthusiastic, 2 were absolutely not into this whole living in the woods thing. Lots of dramatic eye rolling. Best be on my way after filling up with water. I thought about stopping at Deer Lick Shelter but I was so very close to getting to Maryland and it was early so I hiked on. I hoped to be able to get into Waynesboro tomorrow for a quick in and out resupply so best to get as close to route 16 as possible, there is a tent site further up. I filled up all my water at Deer Lick because my guide book says the water at Falls Creek tent site is bad. It doesn't say what is wrong with it! There is a sign on the bridge over Falls Creek that says not to drink, swim or bathe in the water. That’s really bad, I looked to see if any of the fish in the stream glowed with radioactivity, they looked normal so I set up my tent. My bear hang went off at the first throw, awesome! I could barely eat though, it remained hot and humid all night. I have the place to myself.
I heard owls, they hooted “hot-hot  who IS hot-hot?” that is what my head heard anyway. I am sure the owls were quite comfortable.

Rocks Status: Who cares? I am not in Pennsylvania anymore. The status is IMPROVONG!
Again! You never know how a day will turn out. I slept not so well, sticky and sweaty. Ugh. The owls reminding me how hot it was all night. So, I was sluggish to pack up, as I was finishing I just plopped down on a log and sat there. Up the hill comes White Walker, he says, “I got someone picking me up to go to town! food! shower! laundry! Want to come?” Heck YES! Now, I can spring up the hill where, Soggy and pup are waiting. We had pics at the Mason-Dixon line and then piled into the truck and went to Soggy’s house. WW met Soggy way back in Vermont, he said to look him up when WW got to the Waynesboro area. So, here we are. Soggy cooked for us, we got clean clothes and the most heavenly shower I have ever had. We got to chill at his house and then stopped at a grocery store before he took us back to the trail. THAT WAS SO NICE, THANK YOU SOGGY!!  Back on the trail, feeling better. It was just as hot and humid as yesterday but I was in better spirits. Tarried at Pen-Mar park, great view. Then up to High Rock, there was a beautiful view, the actual rock is a broad expanse but is completely covered with graffiti. I read a lot of it and it was 97% family friendly (based on 100 graffiti notes). There were a ton of tourists, White Walker and I tried to make people bring us cold sodas telepathically. We didn’t even smell! Nope. No sodas for us. WW fell asleep and I moved on. The heat/humidity made it slow going but, I adjusted. Right before the shelter, I met Junco. Trail named that because he is a bird watcher. I chatted with Pail, Carly (sectioners), Junco and White Walker, nice mellow crowd. The shelter had a tall, coat like thingy with a metal pole with a hook on top. It’s a bear hang. Odd contraption. You put your bag on the hook and hoist it way up to a coat hook and loop it over. It feels like you are in a circus act. The whole thing is awkward, the pole is heavy and EVERYONE watches you make a fool out of yourself. 
I elected to sleep in the shelter because it really felt like it will rain. I am sleeping in Maryland.

Relief! I woke up to an amazing cool breeze, cool temperature and no humidity. I  felt charged to get going. Tomorrow is going to be the day I walk into Harper’s Ferry! It is all very exciting- Harper’s Ferry is where the National Appalachian Trail Headquarters is. Thru hikers get their picture taken and put in the official record of thru hikers. As I said, it is all very exciting! White Walker and I think we should make an attempt to get as close to Harpers Ferry as we can today so that tomorrow we can get into town really early- it is THAT exciting! We shoot for the shelter 20 ish miles away and if possible go to the 24 ish mile away shelter. We take off and soon are separated by our individual paces. What a relief this weather is! The terrain is ok, some ups to ridges and then walking on top, some ups and downs but I am feeling terrific. I hit the Washington Monument and had my State Line Celebration Snickers Bar. Late, but just as good. White Walker comes zipping up the trail and we both end up at the little park and have some lunch. Off for the afternoon hike, which flies by and its only 3:30 by the time I hit the 20 ish mile shelter. Looks like the 24 mile will happen. White Walker comes strolling in and we have a brief rest and take of again, down to a little park where we find Stumbledwarf at a picnic table. Funny how he just shows up. We relax and chat, it is nice to catch up with such a fun trail pal. Finally, we take off and White Walker disappears, he is on a mission! Arriving at the shelter, I set up and spend the evening eating and relaxing with WW and Lead Foot who is sectioning. I might have trouble sleeping tonight.

West Virginia!! state number 10!!!
Maryland= 2 days
The very exciting day is here! I had some trouble getting to sleep last night. I woke up and immediately looked outside. Crap! White Walker is up and it looks like he is packed and ready to go. I wanted to be long gone by now. I spring into action and am on the trail in no time. I have a long ridge walk, its nice. Followed by a steep descent to US route 340, which I cross and find myself on a beautiful flat dirt and grass road? oh, its the C&O canal towpath. SWEET! I walk along, a canal on one side and the Potomac river on the other. People are jogging, walking, riding bikes very nice. Suddenly, I am on the beautiful pedestrian bridge over the Potomac and into Harpers Ferry. Huh, I follow the white blazes but loose them. I don’t know whats wrong with me, I see that the town is way up on a hill and yet I continue to follow the river. Great, I’m lost in Harper’s Ferry. I finally figure out that I do have to walk all the way up hill and I find the AT Conservancy Office. It’s so cool!! I have seen it a million times in pictures. It is awesome to be here. White Walker and Stumbledwarf were there. It was really busy, tourists coming in and learning about the trail. There is a hikers lounge in the back, 50 cent sodas and a box of free donuts. That’s where they keep the photo logs of all the past the hikers. Perfectly fine time just hanging out. We decide to stay at the Tea horse Hostel, check in is at 3:00. I got my picture taken and I was southbound number 71. We kill some time at a coffee house and then check into the Hostel. It’s a nice one, laundry, kitchen, 2 bunk rooms, 2 baths, dining are and lounge area. I call an area shuttle driver so we can go to Walmart and resupply and get all the snacks and food for the night and the ZERO we are taking tomorrow. Walmart is of course too much stimulation and I am glad to have all my chores done so I can just relax and eat for the whole next day.

Procrastination, I couldn’t have been slower to leave town. Hung out in the Hostel past check out time (sorry). Walked back to the ATC to take a picture of my picture because I forgot to do that. I want to be able to remind myself that I actually made it all the way to Harpers Ferry. You know, in case I get discouraged later on, I can look and see what an EXTRAORDINARY  thru I really am (he-he). White Walker caught the attention of some people who started asking him a million questions. Perfect opportunity for me to just hang out some more. The people started giving him a bunch of snacks which he shared with me, Thank you WW! We finally took our leave and went back to the trail. Short miles today, so I wasn't in a hurry. The trail went up 1000 feet to a ridge and stayed pretty much there. I had one descent to cross a road and then back up. Nice trail, I passed into Virginia! So many states now, this was number 11, and it is a long one. I have never backpacked south of Massachusetts, so I am looking forward to this section. It’s in the south and it is not Pennsylvania. This shelter is super fancy. Great tenting areas, a cooking pavilion, a deck with benches and one of those awkward bear hang poles. Ahhh, first thing, I lay on a bench and fall asleep. White Walker shows up and relaxes with his guitalele. 3 women show up and a Father/son team. We all ate at the pavilion, people were really chatty, I must have been tired because I couldn’t keep with all the conversation. That pole thingy was so heavy, I needed help to get my overflowing food bag up and secured. off to my tent, I fell asleep in 1 second.

That was a great night’s sleep. Time for breakfast, I was glad the shelter had a place for bear hanging but I felt ridiculous holding this tall javelin thing with a hook trying to get my bear bag. When I did snag it, it’s so heavy and awkward that of course I had to let the pole thingy drop. Its attached to the tall coat rack thingy with a chain so it doesn't actually crash to the ground but it made a lot of noise. It’s complicated, I will post a picture. My plan was to stop at the Bear’s Den Hostel for lunch, and maybe buy a soda there. My Cousin is picking me and WW ( should he decide to come) up for some R&R. That isn't until tomorrow at 4:00. The pick up point is only 26 miles from here. I got a good pace going but WW passed me right by. The section known as the Roller Coaster began today, its a sections with continual ups and downs  of 250 to 500 feet, I think. It really wasn't too bad. I saw 2 deer. They stared at me and I stared at them. I blinked and they darted off. I arrived at Bears Den Hostel and found the hikers lounge and bunk area. It's open during the day to hikers. White Walker was there relaxing and having his lunch with a soda. Nice! I had lunch too and became much, much too comfortable. hmmm. don’t have to be anywhere tis 4:00 tomorrow. They have pizza and ice-cream here and pancakes for breakfast. We caved and stayed at Bear’s Den. It is what our pals Pringles and Mojo would have done. The place started to fill up and I was glad we were here early and got to pick out the most comfortable bunks. Just relaxed all evening, watched a movie.
Pancakes and Pizza hold a special place in my heart.

I love a day starting out with pancakes and coffee. Sugar, carbs and caffeine, thats the ticket. Back onto the roller coaster, it was not bad and I was surprised when I passed the sign indicating I was finished with the roller coaster. I caught up with White Walker at a shelter, he was just blazing through today! We had a long lunch because we could. Pick up time at 4:00!
We had time to relax at the road crossing until my cousin came, sitting on the side of the road like bums. I don’t think my cousin wants to be identified on the internet so I will give him and his family Trail Angel Trail Names: 
My cousin is Mr. Awesome
His wife is Mrs. More Awesome
Their dog is Nestles Crunch
Oldest child is Cutie Pie
Youngest child is Super Chill 
Mr. Awesome  arrived- it was so nice to see FAMILY again after such a long time!! He braved our smell and put us in his van and whisked us to his house. Snacks and showers immediately. Mrs. More Awesome came home with Cutie Pie and Super Chill, Nestles Crunch of course goes wild with the family reunion. The kids are quiet and shy with the two strangers in the house, but that  doesn't last long at all. The Awesome family fed us chicken and steak kabobs until we were actually full. We shared an evening of laughs, the Awesome couple are truly hysterical. It's also Friday after a long work week for parents of Cutie Pie and Super Chill.Hence, a little Friday night giddiness.  It was very gracious of the Awesomes for taking us in. 
Off to sleep after successfully reading to Cutie Pie and a rather messy feeding to poor Super Chill, I will improve!

I asked Mrs. More Awesome if she knew we were in the house when she came home yesterday. She replied a quick “oh yes, I did!” “you could smell us, our packs?” “ yes, I definitely could! it’s distinctive” There were waffles and fresh fruit for breakfast, extra yummy. I was thankful that Mrs. More Awesome was a coffee drinker and shared with me. I attempted to feed Super Chill again and got some tips from Mrs. More Awesome like “that’s good, but the food really should go in the mouth.” and “well, I can see your trying, Super Chill needs a shampoo anyway.” I thought I did measurably better. Later, Mr. Awesome let me borrow the van to go resupply. I have not driven a car since the end of May! -  let alone a large van! There was a lot of traffic and the streets had many lanes. It was very tense at first and then became only less frightening. We made it back and piled again in the car to go to a …..Roller Derby! You never know how a day will end up, for sure. It was a blast, I had to concentrate to figure out the rules but I think I did. One of Mrs. More Awesome’s friends was on the team. All in all a good time.

The  first double zero on this trek. We spent the day hanging out, eating, taking final showers. Finishing some chores like repackaging our food, stuff. It was a low energy day, wait, I take that back. It was Low then Suddenly High energy day depending on what Super Chill and Cutie Pie were up to. I know I got better at feeding Super Chill, there were no spray downs after we got done with breakfast and lunch. I also got to play shopping and cooking with Cutie Pie, we also read and made videos on my phone. Being around the kids was different for me. I haven’t been a preschool teacher in a very long time. To Mr. Awesome and Mrs. More Awesome, you guys rock.  Mr. Awesome was inspecting my shoes (brave!) and said they were toast. I should get a new pair while I was in town. I thought, eh, they still feel great on my feet and don't look THAT bad. The tread was starting to separate from the upper, mostly on the left shoe. I thought I could get through the Shenandoah's for sure. Hanging out with family, I didn't think about the trail much. I was reminded that I have an incredible extended family. I thought about all my aunts, uncles and cousins off and on during the day. We didn’t all live in the same geographical area but spent enough time together that we all have shared experiences and similar upbrinings, that we can be close. And, everyone is full of cool beans.

Drizzly morning. The Awesomes were up early to start their work week. They were a picture of organization. Breakfast, kid one, kid two, Cutie Pie’s day bag, Super Chill’s bigger bag, work bags, everything went to the correct vehicle like it was nothing. I felt slow and lumbering amid all the evenly paced coordination. It was amazing. Mrs. More Awesome even sent me off with a travel mug of coffee for the ride with Mr. Awesome back to the trail. Mr. Awesome left White Walker and me on the side of the road in cloudy drizzle. Gone were the comforts of home. It was  early so some big miles were possible. Despite the rain and humidity, ugh, I was able to stretch my legs and keep a good pace. The trail was remarkable. smooth, like a trail maintainer graded it just for me. The climbs were gradual up about 800 feet, some more ups and downs to Manassas gap at mile 1211.9. I came across 2 large box turtles sitting in the trail and 2 deer. I walked along a very long chain link fence at the end the gate had a plethora of signs all indicating that this was government property and to keep out, get out, don’t look, run  away-don’t walk, no loitering or lingering. Well, I exaggerate but it was kind of creepy. I hiked up my first real switchback trail at the end of the day. Endless 180 degree turns and than a straightaway of a gradual climb. Its another way to climb a mountain I guess. Reached the Tom Floyd shelter and that was it for the day. I got set up and hung out with the occupants-White Walker, Camp Shoes, Double Dip, Grizzly (met briefly in New Hampshire), and section hiker Time.  A good day back o the trail.

I passed into the Shennandoah Mountains today. Amazing! Now, I am getting a full tutorial in switchbacks. I keep thinking, I’m climbing only 1200 feet!? why am I so slow? It’s the switch backs. I get to know trees very well, I must say. I pass by the trunk, switch and go back and pass by its branches, switch back and pass by the top. Well, a mile on the AT is a mile. So if the miles are made up of miles and miles of switchbacks, that’s ok. I just walk the trail, I don’t engineer it. The trail is beautiful. Minimal rocks and roots. Lots of up, ridge and down today. I don’t mind at all. It is ridiculously hot and humid though. My glasses are useless and they keep slipping down my face. Grrrrrrrrr.  I am excited even through the trials of humidity and glasses because today, I get to stop at a Wayside. This is am important place because it’s a restaurant!! In the Shennandoah there are many waysides, YAY! not Grrrr.!  I stop at Elk Wallow Wayside and it is awesome. I get a grilled cheese, fries and a milkshake. WOW. I love Virginia. I pass on top of Mount Marshall and Hogback Mountain, it’s not like climbing up and over, it it switch back up, walk on a long ridge and switchback down. After the wayside I go up Pass Mountain and stay on a very long ridge (miles) and end up at the shelter. Nice day, I am wiped by the humidity.

I studied the guide last night and discovered that I was in a perfect spot to have a nice leisure day, cover some good miles and be at a wayside about 4 miles before my evening shelter (HUT actually here in the Shenandoah). That meant that I could hang out at the wayside a good long time. YES! I made a mental note to also call Merrill, the shoe company and arrange to buy a new pair and figure out where to have them delivered. My cousin, Mr. Awesome was absolutely spot on. My shoes were toast. Burnt toast. It’s a good thing I had some super glue and duct tape. The front part of the sole is delaminating from the upper. I am getting pebbles inside the new front flap! Jeekers! I chatted with Grizz, Camp Shoes, Double Dip, Speedo and Nemo. They planned a super huge day. White Walker was more inclined for the relaxed - wayside day. I took off - IN THE WRONG DIRECTION!!! FOR MORE THAN A MILE!!! Oh bother, I simply turned around and rewalked that mile. Eh, what can you do? Such a nicer day! Cooler with an outrageous breeze up on the ridges. The forest is amazing, huge trees without a dense understory. It was nice to look around and hike- the trails were THAT nice. More switchbacking, but I knew the result would be a grand view. I came upon White Walker chatting with his mom up on a beautiful ridge (good Cell reception) and later when he asked how he got in front of me I had to confess, I started the day as a northbounder. oops. The Skyland Lodge and restaurant was really fancy, But they had a nice lounge area with a comfortable seating and a sandwich menu. WW and I had a long relaxing time. I called Merril, and they have a program for thru hikers that they will replace one pair of shoes for FREE! NICE!  I also called Darn Tough (socks), they have a lifetime guarantee and they also are sending me a pair of socks FOR FREE! Everything is going to Glasgow VA, about 140 miles from here. Might be cutting it close. I reluctantly left Skyland but had a really beautiful hike to the hut. Just one other hiker, GoldStar (15 thru) and White Walker.

Beautiful wind and sun today. Amazing views and gorgeous forest. Even the trails were rock and root free. This park is the best. The trail roughly parallels Skyline drive, a road that winds up and around the mountains and ridges, but I rarely notice it. The trail makers did a great job hiding the trail far enough away and below or above the road that I truly don't notice it. Also when the trail crosses the road, It is usually at a parking pull off at a view. Not only do I expect a magnificent view but there is the possibility of people (with food) there as well. Today, I would pass a Wayside soon enough to have breakfast. So Happy! I got up had a snack and hit the trail. The day had ample viewing areas and beautiful forest. I met a park ranger at a view spot who took the time to ask about my thoughts on the park and tell me what I was looking at and the history of the area. Thanks Ranger! He also gave me an apple. Breakfast at the Big Meadows wayside was perfect, I ate a ton, had a milkshake and promplty ordered another milkshake. White Walker said he might just stay, sleep off his food coma and them eat more! HA! I grabbed my pack and got back on the trail, too much temptation in the Wayside. The rest of the day I enjoyed many walks up on ridges that were also cliffs, so the views were fantastic. Miles of closely spaced ridges with steep valleys, go on for ever. I passed a group of birders who  were watching falcons kiting, flying in groups of 5 to 8 in tight circles spiraling far up. It was very cool. Finally at the shelter and feeling very good after a wonderful day. Grizzly, Double Dip, Camp Shoes, Nemo, Speedo, White Walker Junko and Lead Foot. Fun crew at the hut tonight. 
Grizzly read aloud a chapter from the Hobbit as I was falling asleep, it was nice to have a bed time story.

This is my last full day in the Shenandoah Park, so it is my last wayside stop. I have about 12 miles to walk to get to Loft Mountain Wayside. Perfect timing for lunch. I am excited to get going. The crew at the shelter - Grizz, Speedo, Nemo, Double Dip and Camp Shoes read “The Hobbit” and then discussed the chapter. Grizz read aloud. It is kind of cool to be at the same shelter with them because I get a dose of The Hobbit followed by spirited discussion. I listened to a chapter at breakfast today. It feels a tiny bit like fall in the morning, but the day soon heated up. I loved weaving up and down ridges and taking hairpin turns from one switchback to another. I heard some owls last night, and saw a fox today. I arrived a Loft Wayside, it wasn't too busy so I commandeered a table with an outlet. I had my usual grilled cheese and fries with a milkshake. Followed by a coffee and a bunch of other foods, I am too embarrassed to mention all of them. The boys from the shelter filed in one by one and people generally just hung out. I went outside on the deck to re-repair my shoes and a visitor gave me some shoe glue he happened to have in his truck AND extra duct tape. These shoes still have about 109 miles left to go!! I really am crossing my fingers and toes at this point.! I feel like I am wearing silver toed wingtips! The boys were getting ready to delve into another chapter of the Hobbit, and probably wouldn’t be able to stop at just one chapter so I decided to press on. I had a pleasant afternoon with a few climbs all the way to the shelter. People at camp tonight - The Hobbit crew- Double Dip, Grizzly, Nemo, Speedo, Camp Shoes and White Walker, Lead Foot.

I kept checking to see if I really was on the Appalachian Trail. I am definitely coming back and dragging my sister, Free Range, with me. Yesterday was the last Wayside so I was missing my mid day feast. As I was walking down the trail, 4 Fabric Softeners (it’s what I call sweet and clean smelling day hikers he-heh) came walking really fast towards me. One said rather breathlessly, “Watch out up ahead at the next trail junction. A bear, a BEAR was there. It got our cupcakes!” I thought immediately, “Wait, What!? You have cupcakes?” OH, then I realized I might get to see a bear, now that’s exciting. I got my phone out ready to take a picture, real quick so the bear wouldn't even notice me. I approached the junction and walked very slowly, I was staring right at the bear but didn’t realize it until it WOOFED at me. I pointed my phone in the direction and walked backwards slowly. Huh, I was looking right at it but until it moved I just didn’t see it. I just must be fauna blind. It’s a sad condition.  I was staying at Calf Mountain Shelter because it was the closest shelter to Waynesboro. I planned to go to town tomorrow for groceries, shower, a haircut, food, laundry, wifi, yes staying at Hostel. There were a couple of ups and downs and then a rather big up to the shelter. I had to search around a little to find a tent spot that did not have a rock protruding right in the middle where my butt or shoulders would be. Chilly evening, I wore my leggings, long sleeve and hat. There was a couple of campers who were very interested in our trek, who also generously shared their snacks, White Walker, Leadfoot, and 2 girls.
It was a chatty and snack filled evening at the shelter.

I-64 and Route 20 (King's Popcorn Stand) mile 1327.9       7.7 miles hiked
Sheesh, woke up to drizzle and I was chilly. I peeked out and saw cold humid cloud-air. Hmmmf. It is really hard to get out of a dry warm sleeping bag. so so so so difficult. It would be easier if I could actually kick myself in the butt. Since that is not possible, I have to give myself a pep talk. ok. get up…breakfast?….ick, I don’t have anything good……you are going into town today…….it’s so far away…… 7 little miles!….. yup, 7 wet clammy miles….get up….get…up…my socks are wet….yes that’s true….you have done this before and lived…..come on….you never know…I know its WET out there and NICE in here……don’t you have to pee?….oh, be quiet…..I know you do…….ok ok ok ok but just because I have to pee, not because you told me so. uh, I AM you, stop yelling at yourself. Sheesh! Ahhh, on the trail, over Calf Mountain, down to Beagle Gap, up over Bear Den Mountain and down to McCormick Gap, up to a big long ridge and down to cross the Interstate. Oh, it was a foggy drizzly day in the forest. I can’t say I saw much because my glasses once again were useless and I can’t see far without them. I reached the Interstate without too much trouble actually and I couldn't miss the popcorn stand. I thought it was a little weird that the hostel owner, Stanimal, said to just call from the popcorn place and he’d be out to pick us up. When I saw it, I understood. It was a large bright yellow food truck that sells hotdogs, snacks, sodas and gourmet popcorn. It looked like a circus truck. The pop corn lived up to its reputation though, really good. I got a big bag of cinnamon popcorn while I waited. White Walker showed up soon after I arrived and scarfed down some delicious food. We got to the hostel and settled in, showers and a walk to the grocery store when the weather cleared up. White Walker got an enormous package from his mom and friends. Crazy stuff and so much food- it covered his whole bunk! He shared some home made chocolate chip cookies which after today, I thought was very generous if not heroic. 
Relaxed with Netflix way too late into the night. Glad I got up this morning!

Maupin Field     mile 1348.7                  20.8 miles hiked
I was looking forward to today’s hike because I could rack up miles and not carry my heavy pack, that I now called “The Green Freeloader”.  Up early enough for more pancakes, served on the screened in porch and then time to load up. I selected a day pack that didn’t smell. I had learned my lesson to always give a loaner day pack a sniff check. If it stinks, I will stink. Don’t misunderstand me, stink is ok, but it needs to be your own stink or the stink of hiking friends with whom you have become accustomed. Familiarity added to Stink results in a Personal Stink Shield, making the stink invisible to you but, alas, apparent to others. Adam (Stanimal) drove us to the trail head, I took off, oh such a glorious feeling to walk unhindered by that Green Freeloader. The trail now roughly paralleled the Blue Ridge Parkway. I saw that on my map but was unaware of the road while in the woods. The trail topography has changed. I knew I was climbing up about 1700 feet up to Humpback Mountain. The first part of the climb was just gradual up, the last part was switch backs, no rock and no roots. I know this type of trail and what to expect. However, I learned a new trail construct today. The middle trail stayed far below the ridge. The side of the ridge was not a simple downslope. Humpback Mountain had vertical billowing ridges flowing down its side at regular intervals. It was like walking on a steep sideways slanted slope while going up and over ridge after ridge. All in dense forest. I couldn’t mark my progress at all. I was thinking “This is it!”,  “Nope”, “ ok now, this must be it”, uh, not yet”. I will have to get used to traveling on never-ending horizontal ridges and across vertical ridges. I finally get to the top and clearly see the topography, now it all makes sense. That is so cool to see what your feet have experienced but couldn't put into perspective. After Humpback, I stayed up on a normal ridge (long and skinny!) and got to Reid’s Gap where I waited with White Walker and Erica another SOBO. Adam arrived with our heavy packs. ARRRGH, Green Freeloader was back on my back for the final 2 miles. Very nice shelter with tons of tenting spaces. There were some sectioners who shared M-n-Ms and a couple of weekenders. Nice crew. They made a fire! What energy they have! I fell asleep early in my tent.
I love daypacks.

Seeley-Woodworth Shelter   mile 1369.1       20.4 miles hiked
Great sleep but awoke to little spats of rain on my tent fly. I peeked out and saw that it was foggy and the rain was really just leaves dripping. Oh, ok. I can get up then. No pancakes this morning. Much sadness. Today, I would climb up the Priest Mountain, the first 4000 footer since New Hampshire I think?! It remained foggy, cloudy all day so my views were whatever was directly in front of me. That is fine, colors seem a bit more vibrant on a foggy day. I took it slow because of all the climbing. The trail added another construct today! I called it the “Up and Over, East and West Ridge Walk (UOEWRW)”. So the ridges are skinny, really skinny and sometimes are bouldery. UOEWRW gets you up a ridge but makes you actually go up one side, walk about 20 feet and then go down the other side about 30 feet, climb back up, walk 20 feet and go down the other side and keep repeating.  Well it is one way of getting up a ridge I suppose. I reached the Priest shelter around lunch time to find the Hobbit Crew finishing a chapter of, yes, The Hobbit. I ate a quick lunch and enjoyed the viewless views the rest of the day. Following the Priest climb, the trail was relatively easy with a few ups and downs here and there. The Hobbit Crew and White Walker were at the shelter. I realized from their conversation that the Priest shelter log book contains wild “confessions” from thru hikers. Rats! I didn’t know this. If I had I would have spent time reading the entries and adding one huge confession of my own! I would have confessed that I littered, not on purpose, of course not!! I forgot my long spoon in Vermont behind the Minerva Hinchey shelter, I forgot a pair of underwear on a bush (drying out) at the West Mountain shelter in NY and I dropped my teeny weeny pocket knife somewhere in Massachusetts. Spoon, underwear, knife, I guess I did leave a trace and I am very very sorry. At least someone could use my spoon and knife, the underwear- not so much! 
I listened to another chapter of The Hobbit as I fell asleep.

Root Beer Surprise!
I pitched my tent a little bit away from the shelter, last night, not so far that I couldn’t hear the bedtime reading from The Hobbit. That’s a nice way to drift off to sleep. Rain spattered, drizzled and finally let go with insistent rain for about 3 hours last night. I awoke to clammy clouds and damp everything. Hopefully there will be a break of sun and I can dry my stuff out. When the rain really starts to smack down, the dirt and mud starts to fling up from the ground onto my tent. This makes for a big YYYick in the morning. I try to wipe the dirt and grit off but it just shmears all over. Probably best just to pack the thing wet and hope for the big beautiful sun to come out later. Not too bad on my legs today, some ups and downs, the visibility was a perfect zero. I got the sense that I was passing some great view spots, however, I just saw great views of the cloud that engulfed me. Eventually, I made it to a road crossing and the sun was trying to come out. Hmmm, a road, I could go get a whole huge meal… Ahh, the shelter was only 2 miles ahead and I would have time to hang out all my damp crap. So, off I go. It is a pleasant walk to the shelter, There is a good water source right in front. The shelter had 1 occupant, a young man whom I had seen before several times. He’s not one for talking, (at all), not one for nodding “hi” (at all). I secretly call him the really-super-strangely-quiet kid. He eats and then walks away. See you later. I spread everything out and relaxed, nothing to do but enjoy the after rain sights and smells. White Walker came by after a while. He brought me a ROOT BEER!!!!! He was a smart guy, taking advantage of a nearby town (Amherst?) opportunity. Thank you for that Root Beer, it was mighty fine. Well, more rain, I brought in my now only a little damp stuff and settled in for the night. Just White Walker and me.

Rain, and my shoes are happy
For the love of Neptune! Stop with the rain already! My shoes are so hopeless now, The soles are completely unglued from the ball of my foot forward and the heels are crumbling off with every step. I need to get to Glasgow today! The post office closes early tomorrow! My new shoes are waiting for me along with new Darn Toughs. This is an important hustle. I just put my head down and hiked, it rained, poured and the wind gusted so hard that it rained sideways. Nothing to do but put my head down and hustle, hustle, hustle! I collected all sorts of pebbles, mud balls and sticks in my shoes. The front of my shoes flapped with every step, like  fish gasping. I think my shoes enjoyed their final run, through the puddles and mud, one last exciting run in the woods. At the top of the final ridge, I decided to try to call for a shuttle and to my utter relief, Ken said he would meet me at the road. Thank You! By the time I got to the road, the rain stopped and a bit of sun came out. Ken and his wife gave me a tour of the town (it took a minute) and dropped me off at the town hiker pavilion. Its a huge canvas tent/building with supported walls, bunks, electricity, I was pleasantly surprised. I got comfortable, made my way to resupply and then snuggled into my sleeping bag. Rain and more Rain, White Walker and a section hiker JMax showed up, both wetter than wet! All in good spirits though. We had a feast at Scotto’s Italian restaurant and returned to a peaceful rest at the pavilion. I just have to remember to go to the Post Office tomorrow before it closes! New shoes! New socks!

What a lazy morning, Cloudy, now that seems normal so its all good. Its so tempting to take a zero, tempting but we resisted. The gas station provided a good breakfast of nutritious junk. I love junky food now. We dawdled, tried to dry stuff out a little, I retrieved my long awaited shoes and socks- WOW! My feet are ready to go, I can’t believe what a boost I am getting from my new treads. It got late enough to think about having a town lunch, so back to Scotto’s Italian and more stuffing my face. Finally, hitching back to the trail, we crapped out at our first spot, but were successful when we moved away from the intersection. A couple in separate cars picked us up and whisked us away. We walked over the longest footbridge on the AT and felt the sun come out. It was a good day of hiking, I saw some views and just kind of ambled along. The shelter 15 miles up the trail was intended but didn't happen. No hurry. I got to the tent site, set up everything without thinking much about it and ate dinner. Cuddled up in my tent and off to sleep with happy feet. Just me and White Walker here tonight.","Glasgow Hiker's Pavilion

Quiet day on the trail. Walked in the greatness that is sunshine through trees. I had views today! Mountain valley fog, endless mountains, so beautiful. Walked in the greatness that comes with being dry from head to toe. I stopped quite a few times today just to enjoy everything, The trail was rife with switchbacks up to ridges (eventually) but I had the smooth tread way which makes my feet extra happy. Apple Orchard mountain popped above the clouds and I really felt like I was on an island surrounded by whipped cream. Maybe I was hungry on Apple Orchard mountain!  The really-super -strangely-quiet kid appeared briefly and moved along silently, as is his custom. Nice evening with White Walker, we both had buffets from our food bags.

The goal today was to get as close to Daleville as possible in order to get to town EARLY tomorrow. Well, that and enjoy the heck out of the days adventure as well. That goes without saying. The trail crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway many times and almost always at an incredible view spot. So, there was a lot of stopping and viewing going on for my part. I met some folks set up in lawn chairs, binoculars and snacks watching for migrating hawks. I chatted with them for a while and actually saw hawks. They circled up like airplanes in a holding pattern, it was kinda neat. Switchbacks, ridges, views and a few people. The end of the day had a big uphill of course, Why??? Why at the end of the day?? It was just huffy for a little while. Super intense quiet kid was nearby, some section hikers and White Walker were at the shelter. White Walker and I are stoked about town tomorrow. HIs shoes are toast, burnt toast, burnt crumbling toast. He has a new pair waiting for him at the post office.

There is a big sign in the dining room of the Howard Johnson’s. You can’t miss it. I wish I had. I wanted to load up a scrumptious breakfast and eat it in the room. But, apparently, it is against the rules. Sad, Sad, Sad. I got a couple coffees and made do until real breakfast. To be fair, this is a hiker friendly establishment. They let us do laundry, check in early and have a very reasonable hiker rate. Nice folks here. Actually, breakfast in the dining room was fun, re-connecting with Camp Shoes, Double Dip and Mojo. Getting out of town was a bit of a chore, up and up to a ridge with a food-heavy pack. Not bad hiking after that. I enjoyed the skinny ridge, looking down to the highway to one side and farm land on the other. Reached the shelter in the late afternoon and didn’t feel like traveling on. No tent space near the shelter! There was an area far down by the water but for some reason it gave me the willies, perhaps because it’s getting dark earlier. Two hikers, SOBOS came later, Goldilocks (long red hair) and hmmmm Top something, sorry I don’t remember. They camped in the creepy area.

Taking the Picture I’ve been waiting for
Mile 1487.3        Miles Hiked 17.3
No exact plan today except to enjoy Tinker Cliffs and McAfee Knob.  Two places I really wanted to experience after reading about and seeing so many pictures from my obsessive research of the AT. Today is the day! A murky start, then a little clearing, then… as I wound up in elevation, more thick clouds. I had no view from Tinker Cliffs except the trees directly to my left, to my right- the big drop off into the clouds. Well it’s early, I walked slowly to McAfee Knob thinking sometime today the clouds would disperse. White Walker was already there, lots of day hikers as well. We decided to hang out, have a long lunch and enjoy the unfolding view. The clouds finally relented and we took photos of each other. Relaxing couple of hours, very cool to finally be there! We decided to make it to the Four Pines Hostel. White Walker ambled off and I left later. Four Pines is a guy’s 3 car garage converted into a hostel. There are various cots, beds and couches, a stove, sodas, outdoor chickens and an indoor cat.  All very comfortable. However, the big draw for this place is the shuttle to a restaurant called The Homeplace. It is AWESOME!!! They serve family style to your table, you have a choice of meats; chicken, pulled pork, ham and they bring out an obscene amount of sides. The food just keeps coming!! as soon as you finish one item, the bowl is replaced with a full one. Chicken, gravy, mashed potatoes, beets, beans, biscuits, apple butter, coleslaw and more. We did every hiker out there proud, so so so good!

A steady hard rain was falling and there was a distinct nip in the air. White Walker stirred a little and I whispered my  assessment of getting up and getting hiking… No, don’t do it! It’s a perfect place to Zero, outside today is a perfect recipe for yyyyyickness! I sunk back into my sleeping bag, it’s like having a snow day from school. Delicious feeling. Took the shuttle to the grocery store and filled up with snacks for the day. Napped, chatted with 2 frozen hikers who came in from the rain, no netflix because the wifi was too far away from the hostel, that’s ok. Mostly I waited for the shuttle to take us to the Homeplace again!! It was even better than last night, I believe because I was drooling in anticipation all day.

I decided to hoof it today, It was a good day and my legs were feeling their stride. There were 3 ups of about 1500 feet each. The last UP took me to a ridge which unfortunately was rocky. Up one side of the ridge to rocks, then down the other side and repeat. However, it lead me to a nice camp spot with a flowing brook and stellar bear bagging trees. I had the place to myself and was just settling down to eat when Data showed up. I was actually feeling kind of lonely so i welcomed his company. After this thru hike, Data will have completed the 3 long hikes in the US. The PCT, CDT and AT- it’s his triple crown.

The plan was to get up pre-sun, however, we snoozed until after the sun came up. That's ok, we picked out a good day’s hike and set out. The trail was very zippy, mostly flat, going through rhododendron tunnels and back out to open forest. We stopped at view spots along the way. We got to our road - it really was called “Lickskillet” and WW dad was waiting for us. WW mom had prepared a tasty Italian diner- a wonderful day on the Appalachian Trail! We spent an evening chilling out, ice cream from WW favorite creamery, laundry and showers. AHHH. RV hiking is nice. Thank you to White Walker’s family for your hospitality and good times! It was much appreciated.

It was sad, sad, sad to see the RV disappear on it’s way up north. WW family was going to provide trail magic and slacking to WW brother in law, Tesla, who was somewhere in the Shennandoah.  Ugh, my world came crashing down when I put on the big Green, fully stocked pack. Heavy. It felt so so heavy after 2 days of slacking and being pampered. The trail wasn't so bad but it felt bad. Little by little though, I felt the pack less and less. I reached the shelter and walked the 500 miles down to the water and commenced eating. White Walker showed up, walked the 500 miles to the water source and dug into HIS food bag. One a Day showed up and reported that a big group of SOBOs were headed this way. The place filled up! Sailor Moon, One a Day, Data, Creature, Fish Addict? and some others, I didn’t get all the names. It was a lively crew at Helvey Mills!
One a Day carries a speaker and always as some cool music playing. He always inquires first if it’s ok to put on the music.

OK back to reality. A nice reality, I am hiking the Appalachian Trail!! so what if I have to carry this pack? I get to hike every day, eat lots of food, see cool stuff and meet some interesting people. Today had it’s share of ups, mostly in the afternoon. Generally, I felt like I had a nice easy quick pace and just let y legs fly. The scenery was varied, I mostly noticed the change of season, the air, the angle of the sun, some change of leaf color. I missed the freezing nip in the morning air and the sound of migrating ducks and geese that I experience at home though. Right before the last big up to the shelter, I had to load up on water since there was none at the shelter. It’s heavy, but I enjoy my hot meals. The shelter, Chestnut Knob, sits in an open field, it’s 4 sided and made of stone. Real bunks and a table inside. I met Waker, he turned out to be from Saranac Lake and a fellow ADK 46er. Nice to chat with someone from home- and someone who knows the Adirondacks! Eventually, White Walker, Data, Sailor Moon showed up. White Walker played his guitalele, nice!

 What a great day of cruising along on the trail today! Up, Down, it didn’t matter, my legs just did their thing and I was free to enjoy mindless thinking. That’s a real thing, - mindless thinking. I think…. My guide showed that the trail passes through Atkins, or at least the part that has a restaurant and a Budget Motel, there is also a gas station resupply. Perfect! I texted White Walker and let him know if he or anyone else wanted to split the room. The promise of town food gave me another boost to skipping down the trail. I passed a sign that informed me I had 1/4 of the trail left to go! I have hiked 75% of the Appalachian Trail. Whoa, that gave me my first feeling of bittersweetness. I was thrilled to be 3/4 finished but not sure how I felt about only having 1/4 left to go. Oh nuts, I will just focus on the fact that I will be meeting my sister, Free Range soon at Fontana Dam, NC. The motel was where it was supposed to be as well as the Barn Restaurant. White Walker, Sailor Moon, Data and I enjoyed a big feast and then relaxed at the motel. The room got stuffy feeling in the middle of the night, so we cracked the door. I figured the 4 of us would keep each other safe. Maybe it felt stuffy because of all the outdoor time my body was getting on the trail. 
Anyway, it was good to take a shower. Data did shower laundry. Yep, it is what you think it is.

Lazy morning. I woke up refreshed and slipped out to the gas station for coffee, hot chocolates and donuts for my suite mates. We ambled back to the Barn for a huge breakfast. That place does not disappoint. Eggs, bacon and pancakes, more coffee too. Never hurts to double up on the caffeine. Data and Sailor Moon got a ride for serious resupply at a nearby Walmart. WW and I went back to the motel and packed up to hit the trail. Again, not a bad day for hiking. Just cruising and noticing the change of season. I reached the Mount Rogers Information Center, happy to see it was open. The shelter is right around the corner so to speak, so I hung out looking around. WW showed up and we ordered pizzas and soda delivered to the Information Center- Cool beans!! the shelter is kinda fancy AND there was a place to put your trash, that is always appreciated. Slowly, lots of hikers showed up; Smokey, Data, Creature, Corn, One A Day, Sailor Moon, Gumby Bear, Fish Addict, some other people too but I don’t recall who. Nice night listening to everyone catch up and hear their stories. 
Pancakes and Pizza in one day, the best.

Lots of open woods, fields, some streams and leapfrogging with other hikers whom I now know by name. The Virginia trail itself is Sooooooooo nice, smoooooth. I feel like a trail maintainer elf works all night smoothing and raking the trail just so my feet feel happy all day. Stopped for lunch next to some running water, it sounded so pretty and peaceful. Certainly brightened up my bear bag boring lunch. I got to the shelter and still had plenty of light for chores. When the sun goes down, there is now a very short period of dusk then boom- it is dark. the extra tie was spent down at the piped spring which was just a trickle, drip, drip. No matter, I just sat and enjoyed the quiet. Back at the shelter, I set up my tent and started diner with Corn. Not that I had vegetables, Corn, is a hiker. A big crew assembled slowly and once again I fell asleep listening to hiker chatter. 
Looking forward to Grayson Highlands and the wild ponies tomorrow.

From my nightly email to family-
Hello everyone!
Today was so exciting I just can't believe it. A half moon lit up my morning start and I climbed what seemed forever. I was at the top of Pine mountain at 5000 feet just as the sky started to lighten. To my surprise the summit was partly open and I had a view of the horizon. That was beautiful. More hiking on a ridge took me to a field where I was just one with the cows, they had horns which startled me a bit. They just peered at me and went back to eating so I walked a quickly and as gracefully as I could through the fields of cow poo. I thought there was supposed to be a fence in-between me and the cows, not so! As soon as I reached Grayson highlands, the Shetland ponies were right there- on the trail! They just went about eating but some of them came up to me, to say hey whatcha got there? So cute and very friendly indeed! The landscape was and remained open for most of the day it's been a long time since I could see the horizon. I passed Mount Rogers, the highest point in Virginia and made my way to Lost mountain shelter. 8 people in the shelter. Like sardines. I opted to stay in the shelter due to impending rain. So I was a sardine too. Oh well I had no trouble falling asleep. I miss everyone and then I remember that I have less than 500 miles to go. Piece of cake!

Up by headlamp, Oh so quiet because people were still snoozing. I was surprised to see another headlamp- it was Gumby and soon White Walker. We quietly crept out of the shelter area and hoofed it right along. Why so fast? It’s a town day! We were headed to Damascus and the forecast was for rain. The rain started about 1/2 hour into the 16 mile trek to town. What to do? Put your head down, ignore the fact you can't see (Glasses!!) and ignore the wind. Just keep going! We did great! 5 hours and we hiked 16 miles! in the rain! That's how motivated were were to get to town. We made a bee line to a gas station for some well deserved snacks. Then off to Woodchucks Hostel, get dried out, warm and clean. The bunkhouse was actually a converted shed, like you would buy at Lowe’s. Actually despite it’s small size, it was quite comfy in there. We also had access to laundry, showers, dining room and a common area in the house. Breakfast included of course. White Walker and I walked around town eating all day and relaxed later at the hostel. One by one people started showing up. Creature, Corn, Smokey, Honey Buns, One A Day, Sailor Moon, Data, Piece by Piece, Scruffy, Insect, That Guy, Duchess of Slugs. I haven’t seen Honey Buns, Duchess and That Guy in forever. Debating about taking a zero, I will see.

Hello everyone!
Just a note to say that I'm no longer in Virginia! That's so exciting. I really enjoyed my state line celebration snickers bar. Tennessee started with extra nice trails. That means low grade and no rocks. It was cold today mostly because it was very windy and I spent a long time up on a ridge. It was hard to leave the nice warm hostel but I finally got off the comfy couch and made it back to the woods after eating some waffles. I saw a young buck this afternoon in a field. Beautiful. There are 5 other people here at the shelter all horrified that it's gotten cold. I feel ok about it but then I'm from Syracuse!! I'm at Double spring shelter mile 1738.8. Have s good day!

Hi everyone!
Hope you are all enjoying a nice day. Last night was very chilly, yes I could see my breath. It was actually nippy. I was pretty cozy in my tent with my warm clothes on. My first full day in Tennessee and I discover that there are no privies at the shelters. Ick. That's all I can say! The hiking was good though with a fair bit of up and down. I had partial views up on the ridge of Watauga Lake. It's a man made lake by the TVA in 1949. I saw it from afar and through the course of the day made my way down to it. Very pretty lake. I was planning on staying at the shelter near the lake but discovered that is was closed due to bear activity. I don't know what the Bears are doing but it's probably not singing around the campfire! My choice was to hike on to a campsite up this huge hill or move to the next shelter about 8 miles away. Ugh I did a little research and found this new hostel called Boots Off nearby. So here I am. Problem solved and my feet are happy! Take care everyone.
Love,
Insect
The bunks at Boots Off had little curtains for privacy like in a train sleeping car. Very cool! there was also an outdoor shower and the shower head was a garden pail with holes drilled in the bottom, also cool!","Double Springs Shelter

Hi everyone!
Hope everyone had a good day. It was a nice one here in Tennessee. I'm approaching Roan Mountain. It's apparently a mountain and a town. The hostel bunk room last night reminded me of a sleeping car on a train. Each bunk had a privacy curtain and reading lamp. Very cozy. The hike today went up over one medium hill and then a never ending hill. Mountain, I guess I should say. The trail was very unrocky to my feet's delight. There was a section of about a half mile where the trail was about 8 feet wide with 16 foot high rock walls and ledges on either side. That was cool. The breeze was tunneled through the area. Breeze, more like a gale force wind! I stopped at a view spot for lunch and was surprised to see that I had a signal. I called my mom and we had a good chat. So I'm caught up with the family’s goings on. Several fellow hikers passed while we were talking so I hope my mom was assured that I'm never really alone out here. The miles coincided perfectly for another hostel stay! I'm at Vangos hostel. It is off a blue blazed trail at Laurel forks bridge on the AT. It took me forever to actually locate the Blue Blazes, I don’t know why because once I spotted that first  blaze they were all so clear. The hostel is a simple bunk room with a kitchen. I purchased a pizza and a pint of Ben and Jerrys for 10 dollars. I had a nice hot shower and a killer view outside. All for 20 bucks. Nice. I guess you could say I'm hostel hopping. So far, I love Tennessee for sure. I miss seeing White Walker. I bet he will pass me one of these days. That’s it for now. Love to all.

Hi everyone!
Hope all is well! Today was a handful of exciting milestones. I passed 1800 miles, crossed over into NC- briefly, then back into Tennessee, have less than 400 miles to go and climbed my first ""bald"". It's all too much to take in!!! I had a good rest at the hostel last night. There was me and one other hiker, Samuri Blue. I first met him in Pennsylvania and haven't seen him until recently. I have noticed the tops of ridges and mountains having large grassy areas on top. I didn't realize how absolutely huge they were until today. I walked about 3 miles on a ridge bald. You can see 360 degrees. It's very pretty. I had to take a lot of breaks to take in the scenery. It is Incredible. Saw 3 people and there is one other hiker here right now. I'm at the Overmountain shelter which I believe for me meant ""get over this mountain!!"" It's a converted barn with cooking downstairs and sleeping upstairs. It's really cool. The view looks straight down a valley. Both ridges are bald. I can see where I walked. 16 days and 217 ore miles until I meet my sister, doing pretty good! Ho hum! Time for bed!!

Wow! An impressive day, walking up to and over so many balds. I loved it!  Staying at or above 4000 feet all day was awesome. A sunny and breezy day. Round Bald, Jane Bald, whew- down to Carver Gap, only to switchback my way up to Roan High Knob shelter. Holy crap, it was freezing up there at 6200 feet. This is the highest shelter on the AT. Getting there took me through a pine forested area. The pine trees smelled incredible and it was so weird to experience such tall tall trees at this elevation. I read in the journal that the Hobbit Crew spent the previous evening here and slept like popsicles! the majority of the rest of the day was spent switching up to long ridges and switching down to gaps. Over all, a super pleasant day. I arrived at Cherry Gap shelter to find the Hobbit Crew debating whether to move on or not. Procrastination central. Very fun to listen to the negotiations, they took a break to eat stuff. Grizz brought out his mayonnaise jar with the crusted food inside and added some water and  mashed potato buds. His cooking method is to shake the jar with enthusiasm and eat the contents cold using a flat stick. Ooooh, yum? They eventually decided to move on, leaving me the only person at this shelter. No one else showed up. I snuggled in my sleeping bag after a less than satisfying dinner and listened to the owls and night creatures rustling in the leaves. 
The Hobbit Crew smelled so so so bad. I usually do not smell hiker funk but this group has a special kinda perfume.

Hi everyone!
Well, I did some math. Yes, I used my phone calculator and guidebook so I'm fairly certain everything is correct. I'm at mile 1847.0 in Erwin Tennessee. So I have 342.1 miles to the southern terminus at Springer Mountain. It's a bronze plaque set in a rock. Very ho hum to some but exciting to me! I'm also excited to say that I have only 175 miles until I meet my sister in Fontana Dam NC. She is finishing the trail with me. I'm so happy about that! Not only is she my sister but she's my friend AND of course she's a girl!! I've been living on the trail almost exclusively men and the occasional dog for months, so it will be nice to have a bit of girl power out here!! No offense to my guy family and friends. It's been interesting and educational getting to know the trail guys and that's all I will say about that!! (More stories later)
Today smelled like rain and it did spit and sprinkle then pour this afternoon. I was on my way to Uncle Johnny’s hostel in Erwin Tennessee so I didn't care about getting wet. This hostel is right on the trail and has a good resupply. I was low on food so naturally I opted to get a little cabin and food. It's quite cozy. There were a few climbs today, Unaka mountain was different because it had dense spruce trees unlike the open forests I've been through lately. I saw no one on the trail and I had the shelter to myself last night. This hardly ever happens. I'm glad for the rain as it will fill up the streams and springs for the next few days or so. That makes my job of finding water easier. I wish the rocks or trees just had water spigots but they don't! Hope everyone had an enjoyable day!

Hi!
Happy Friday everyone! Hmmm. I don't have much of the trail to report today because I never set foot on it! I stayed at the hostel for a much needed rest. There are big climbs coming up and my legs said ""whoa"" we need a moment! "" I said to my legs ""good idea"". So, I took the shuttle to the grocery store and got some normal food (bananas, milk, eggs, bacon, etc) and that's about as far as I went. I cooked up my food and ate and napped. Well, I napped and watched a lot of Netflix on my phone! Now I actually feel refreshed and look forward to hiking tomorrow. My friend White Walker is probably now ahead of me, but I'll catch him sometime for sure. I have clean clothes and took 2 showers. I know - exciting! Many more hikers came in today and there is a little tent city in the tenting area. I have met some of them on the trail. Some of the hikers picked up food boxes that they had mailed here. It looks like a grocery store explosion! I broke down and bought a cap with a visor, basically a baseball cap, it has the AT logo on it. Its all that was available. The sun is at such a low angle that it always seems to be in my eyes no matter what direction I am going. I am a squinting insect lately. This should help with that problem. Have a wonderful evening everyone!
