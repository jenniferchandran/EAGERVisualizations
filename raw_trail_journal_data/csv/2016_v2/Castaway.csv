Castaway,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520651,"I’m fulfilling a goal I have had for the past few years – hiking the AT. I’ve always enjoyed the outdoors. When not working, sailing, or traveling you can find me most weekends on the trail. I have enjoyed reading, learning and living vicariously through other hikers on Trail Journals. Now it is my turn. A special thanks to former thru hikers Red Beard, Trail Pilgrim, Wingnut and many others for allowing me to follow their journey. You were great teachers. I’m looking forward to the adventure, physical challenge, and the opportunity to meet the great people on the trail. 
About my trail name - Castaway. I’m an avid sailor and traveler. My wife and I have a sailboat near Annapolis, Maryland and spend most weekends exploring the Chesapeake Bay. Three years ago, we took our 37’ ketch sailboat, SV SEADUCTION from the Chesapeake Bay to Key West and back - a 3,000-mile epic journey. As a retired US Army Soldier, I was stationed/deployed overseas for nearly 14 years. 
Traveling and adventure is in my DNA. Life is good.
“Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. “ – Mark Twain",,View Entry,"Jan 25, Mon",0
Castaway,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520449,Hiked 6 miles today in Prince William Forest. First chance this year to hike in snow. Prince William Forest is 25 miles south of DC and is managed by the National Park Service. There are a number of trails with fairly good ups and downs. The OSS trained here during WWII.,,View Entry,"Jan 30, Sat",6
Castaway,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520486,Excellent hike from I-66 to Manassas Gap Shelter. A great way to spend the morning. There is still 2-3 feet of snow on the trail from the blizzard last weekend. I ran into a group of Korean-American hikers who hike the trail every weekend. They invited me to join them for lunch at the shelter. It has been a while since I last had kimchi. One advantage of living near Washington DC is access to great trails. Harpers Ferry and the Shenandoah National Park are within an hour drive.,,View Entry,"Jan 31, Sun",6
Castaway,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522509,One week from today I will be leaving Springer! I will be flying from DC to Atlanta early next Friday morning and will take Survivor Dave's taxi to Amicalola Falls.

Castaway,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523257,"My early morning flight from DC to Atlanta was uneventful. I took the 45 minute ride on MARTA from the Atlanta airport north to North Springs where I was picked up by Duffy from Hiker Hostel. We stopped at a Super Target and picked up a few last minute items. I'm really pleased with the accommodations at Hiker Hostel! I highly recommend you check these guys out.

Castaway,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523529,Josh from Hiker Hostel drove 8 of us to the Springer Mountain parking lot. We hiked the mile up to the Springer Mountain southern terminus plaque. What a great day to start my hike. I couldn't have asked for better weather. The temps were in the high 60's. Many day hikers from Atlanta were out enjoying the the beautiful trails around Springer. I stopped at Stover Creek Shelter for lunch and pushed on to Hawk Mountain Shelter for the evening. What a great first day!,"Springer Mountain

Castaway,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523627,"It started to rain around 2 a.m. and did not ease up until after 10 a.m. Fortunately the temps stayed in the 50-60 range most of the day. I found the climb up Sassafras Mountain a challenge given the wet rocks and the rate of elevation. I stopped at Gooch Shelter for lunch and to dry out my tent. I had my first trail magic at Gooch Gap courtesy of ""Sticks"", Class of 2015. Thanks Sticks! The hotdog and cold drink was just what I needed. After great conversation and a good rest I pushed on to Woody Gap for the evening.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Castaway,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523629,"I broke camp around 8am this morning and pushed on to Blood Mountain Shelter. The weather started to turn around 11 when it started to drizzle and the fog moved in. The worst of the fog came as I reached Blood Mountain Shelter. There were a few day hikers at the shelter. I walked down to Neels Gap with a University of Georgia professor who had her PhD in military history. Needless to say, we had a great chat on the way down. My fun meter was pegged so I decided to stay at the hostel at Mountain Crossings. For $17 it wasn't a bad deal for a shower, a quick was of clothes and a warm and dry place to sleep. A Georgia College Christian group stopped by the hostel and served zucchini, salad and French bread for dinner. What a treat!","Woody Gap

I walked with El Tejano for a while and enjoyed our discussion about our family and travel experiences. I stopped at Wolf Trap Top for lunch and had a peanut butter and jelly wrap and a granola bar. I stopped at Low Gap Shelter to get water and take a quick sponge bath in the nearby stream. I pushed on a couple more miles and stealth camped. Wow, I still can't believe I'm on the trail. I feel blessed. Life is good.","Neel Gap

It was another gorgeous day with temps in the mid-70's and sunny. The back of my neck got a little to much sun today. I found the hike over Blue Mountain a challenge; especially the thousand foot descent in a little over a mile. At Unicoi Gap, I hitch hiked 12 miles to Helen for a resupply and to get a bite to eat. It was such a beautiful day that I decided to get a hotel for the evening. I grabbed dinner at one of the German restaurants and had a couple of beers. Just what the doctor ordered. All in all a great day!","North of North Gap Shelter

A nice hot shower, clean clothes, German food and a few beers is just what I needed last night. Today was another beautiful day. I hiked 13.5 miles over Rocky Mountain, Tray Mountain and Kelly Knob. I saw more hikers on the trail today than previous days. I'm camped near Deep Creek Shelter and there must be 20 tents and hammocks set up around the shelter. With luck, I should make the GA/NC border tomorrow.","Unicoi Gap

Castaway,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524258,I left Deep Creek Gap around 7:30 a.m. and walked the 3.6 miles to Dicks Creep Gap. Most of the folks who stayed at the shelter are planning to stay at the North Georgia Hostel or are going into Hiawassee to get a hotel. I was running a little short on supplies so took the van to the hostel and purchased a few additional food items to get me the 40 miles to Winding Stair Gap. I was back on the trail by 10 a.m. Today was another gorgeous sunny day with temps in the high 60's. The highlight of the day was crossing into North Carolina. I met PopTart at the sign. After taking a few pictures I pushed on to Muskrat Creek shelter for the evening. What another fabulous day on the trail.,"Deep Creek Shelter

I left Muskrat Creek Shelter by 7:45 a.m. The fog and mist had set in and visibility was only 150 feet. I really enjoyed the hike over Standing Indian Mountain; my first 5,000 foot climb. Unfortunately, the mountain was socked in with fog. I want to make Winding Stair Gap by tomorrow afternoon so I pushed on to Betty Creek Gap for the evening.

It is by far the most crowded spot I have camped so far. After a 2 mile hike down to Stecoah Gap I hiked up ""Jacobs Ladder."" I certainly did not set any speed records climbing the 900 feet in about a mile. This is one of the most challenging sections I have hiked to date. I stopped at Cable Gap Shelter around 3 p.m. due to a weather front. Rains started around 4:30 p.m. and continued to around 4 a.m.","Locus Grove Gap

The hike down to Fontana was pretty uneventful. At Fontana 28 AT Crossing I took the shuttle to Fontana Village. They have a pretty good store with everything you will need for the Smokies. I washed clothes, washed and cleaned everything in my pack and had a great meal at the restaurant. I'm glad I decided to spend a night here. I will be taking the shuttle back to the trail early tomorrow morning. I'm looking forward to the Smokies!","Cable Gap Shelter

A guy staying at the lodge gave us a ride to Highway 28 - next to the Fontana Marina. This is where we ended up yesterday. We walked passed the famous Fontana Hilton Shelter. It is by far the finest shelter so far on the trail. It overlooks Fontana Lake and is equipped with flushing toilets, showers and even a solar powered cell phone charging station. We walked down the hill to the Fontana Dam. It is hard to believe it was built in only 18 months during WW2. We walked across the dam and entered the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The AT runs 74 miles through the Smokies. After dropping off our park passes we climbed up hill for the next two hours to the Shuckstack fire tower. Check out the photos I took from the tower. Absolutely breathtaking. I arrived at the Russell Field Shelter around 5:30 p.m. There are around 25 hikers here tonight. It is suppose to rain early tomorrow.

Excellent views all day. I really enjoyed walking in the ferns and the deep green moss covered logs. It reminded me of Victoria, Canada.

It was a nice walk to Charles Bunion with a number of day hikers. It was great seeing all of the families out enjoying a great day on the trail. After about 30 minutes enjoying Charles Bunion, I headed north on the AT and did not see another sole for the next 3 hours. I found today one of the more enjoyable days on the trail.

I really enjoyed the views and ""ridge walking"" on a 3-4 foot path along the ridge with steep drop offs on both sides. The highlight was visiting Mt Cammerer tower. This has probably been the highlight of the trip. It is only .6 miles off the AT and well worth the visit. I witnessed the National Guard airlifting a sick day hiker on the mountain next to the tower. These guys are real pros. Tomorrow I will be leaving the Smoky National Park.","Pecks Corner Gap
