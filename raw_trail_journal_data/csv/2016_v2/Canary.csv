Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516970,"2016 Appalachian Trail Plans.... During the past 5 months, my 2016 AT plans have started to take form. I plan to first catch those 40 miles I missed that remain in northern Virginia. Then I'd like to do all of the 230 miles of Pennsylvania for a total of 270 miles in 18 days. I plan to start 2 weeks earlier than I usually do to miss the heat/humidity. Jackson will once again be my constant companion.New for 2016, I have a friend who has requested to join me for the full 18 days. Her name is Debbie Rodman and she is already far ahead of me in physically being prepared. She is a novice long distance hiker and is working on building her expertise here at home on the Ice Age Trail. Her 1st time experience on the AT will give me lots of new perspective to share with you on FB during our hike.The terrain in PA is extremely rocky. The attached photo is Jackson in May 2015 in northern Maryland showing you how the 2016 terrain will be. It most certainly won't be a gentle dirt path.",,Initial Itinerary Thoughts,"Oct 27, Tue",0

Exercise and hike training hasn't really been a priority this fall with Dave's ATV rollover accident. But with only 6 months left, its time to get moving. So we started Monday with our morning drill of light stretching exercises and a daily road walk/jog of 1.5 miles without backpack weight. Over the next 6 months I'll be increasing exercise, distance, weight, and adding tough-terrain hikes. This is last year's picture, but this same crew (minus Sandy) will once again join me for all pre-hike hikes.",,Let the Pre-Hike Training Begin,"Nov 11, Wed",0

Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521681,"On September 12, 2015, Dave left home in his black Chevy Pickup at 4:00 a.m. heading to our lake home in northern Wisconsin. He was to spend a beautiful day ATVing with friends. He arrived safely and prepared his gear and ATV leaving to meet up with his brother and friends. I enjoyed the day at a local dog trial. Shortly after returning home, I got a call from Dave's brother. Dave had been in a serious ATV rollover accident. He was being Medevac'd from Northern Michigan to Wausau, WI. The next 24 hours were to be a blur of friends and family rallying to take care of everything that needs to be done in one's time of need. And then one coincident after another began to unfold. That many coincidents don't just happen, this was a true miracle Dave was enveloped in. The right decisions by friends at the accident scene, the right EMT decisions, the right transport assessment & packaging by his ER doctor and nurses, the right Trauma Center in the entire Midwest, the right Trauma Surgeon assigned on a Saturday. Dave's guardian angel was exhausted but not finished. Over the next week, I stayed by Dave's side and slowly Dave came back to me from the edge of death. It was a miracle. Dave passed many hurdles to overcome very serious injuries. During the past 3 months, his cognitive skills returned, his physical injuries were on the mend, he slowly returned to work being tasked with light duty, no wrenches were going to be turned for a long time. He is my Miracle Man!!!One of his recovery exercises is the need for daily walks. So I am now extremely blessed to have a new hiking partner for my practice hikes. My Miracle Man has need of daily hiking, on uneven surfaces, for 30-90 minutes. No complaints from me!!! I thank God every day I still have Dave with me and darn it, I have to spend every day going for a hike with this wonderful man!",,My Miracle Man,"Dec 25, Fri",0
Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521683,Dave and I traveled to our northern Wisconsin lake property to celebrate the Christmas Season with family. Both our boys and our daughter-in-law were in Portland and staying at home seamed empty. The day after Christmas we took the fur babies and went hiking on the snowshoe trails that didn't have enough snow to required snowshoes. It was gorgeous. Sadly there wasn't enough snow and ice to cover the river that split the trails in 1/2 nor was there a bridge so we just walked the northern 1/2 of the trail.,,Hiking the snowshoe trails,"Dec 26, Sat",0

There are many Kettles and Moraines to cross to get to this bench which is located at one of the higher elevations on the entire IAT. Dave and I have talked about starting to document our hikes and string them all together and possibly be in the Thousand Mile IAT Club. That is where you hike the IAT either as a thru-hike or in Sections such that ALL Sections are hiked and then you have completed the entire trail.

I've made some headway on all three fronts but the most gains have been made with my usage of my new, free iPhone Strava App. I've been practicing with it and just love the way it shows my path on a map, distance and time hiked, but most of all the elevation gain data is nicely displayed. I'm very excited to give this a test run during this year's Section Hike as I think we will have plenty of cell phone service throughout the hike to run the App. I also have found a great lightweight cell phone recharger battery that will recharge my iPhone three times once I'm out on the trail so I won't have to worry about using the App and my iPhone dying. I plan to not take my solar charger this year. It doesn't work well under the canopy and I believe this recharger will work much more efficiently for the weight requirements. Recharger should recharge my FitBit too but I haven't experimented with that yet. May need a new FitBit before I go since the one I have requires a recharge every 48 hours.

Debbie will do mostly dehydrated dinners. I have 6 different dinner selections that I like for dinner.1) Easy Mac. I like to put extra cheese in it from a block of cheddar cheese that I bring. I like to carry a 1 lb block of cheddar in a zip lock. Jackson and I share it.2) Soup packet. It makes one dinner. I like to put chicken chunks in the soup to beef it up and top with oyster crackers.3) I will plan on four dinners from the dehydrated dinner selections.4) Instant mashed potatoes with instant gravy and chicken chunks.5) Dehydrated spaghetti sauce, penne and cheese chunks.6) Dehydrated spaghetti sauce and gnocchi.There are three different lunches that I like to make. All three go on either soft taco shells or saltine crackers. Saltine crackers in Jackson's pack works well but are impossible in people backpacks to keep from smashing.
1) tuna packet with two mayo packets2) peanut butter3) pepperoni, cheese, and taco sauce.Many people use honey to sweeten their peanut butter. I don't like it and keep scheming how to take some jelly.
Breakfast is either instant oatmeal, honey buns, or bagels with cream cheese. I spice up the oatmeal with additional brown sugar, dried cranberries, and raisins in zip lock bags prior to departure. I've only tried the bagels back in 2009. I'm going to try them again this year.For breakfast and dinner I usually have two packets of hot chocolate in one cup of hot water or four packets per day. It's my drink of choice. I've never tried any instant coffee.Dinner dessert will be either a chocolate bar or the instant pudding (this year's newest experiment).Everyday I have 2nd breakfast of one pop-tart packet. This leaves snacks: beef jerky (homemade), various granola bars, trail mix, fish crackers, and hard candy (keeps mouth from drying out). I like to take basic trail mix add more M&Ms and honey roasted peanuts to it and put in several zip locks.

Assessing that there was no issue, I quieted him down, returned to my bunk and got dressed. I hit up the kitchen next for breakfast and then returned to my bunk to gather all my gear. Debbie was up and doing the same. We tossed all the gear into the mini-van and headed to the lower parking lot to wait for Strings. Debbie and Jackson climbed in with Strings and I drove my mini-van to the Ashby Gap parking lot with Strings following behind. We left the mini-van there and then headed off to US Hwy 522 in Front Royal, VA. I had missed this section between Front Royal and Ashby Gap last year due to the excessive heat. We were now going to spend the next two days tiding that little mess up.After hitting up LOVE'S for coffee, we arrived at Front Royal and said our good-bye's to Strings. It was cool and overcast but not raining. They had a terrible amount of rain the week prior to our arrival and everything was still pretty muddy on the trail. We crossed over Bear Hollow Creek and began our 1000' ascent for the morning.5 miles north out of Front Royal, VA we decided to stop in at a luxurious shelter and check it out for 2nd breakfast. It is the Jim & Molly Denton Shelter. Nice place. It has Adirondack chairs, solar shower, fancy privy, windows in the shelter, steel roof, painted decking, horseshoe pits, separate pavilion with picnic table! Fancy! According to radar, there was ONE cloud in the sky and sadly it moved over us during 2nd breakfast. It started pouring. Wisely we waited it out and stayed dry. I headed out before Debbie and found the trail to be very slick now due to the rain. I had to move carefully as the trail now was heading downhill to a stream and I'd prefer not to fall in the mud. The stream crossing was rather tricky and Jackson and I paused for a bit to wait for Debbie and help her with the crossing. When she didn't arrive, we decided to move on. Around 1:00 p.m. we arrived at a picnic area with a big footbridge that crossed the next stream. There was a nice picnic table so we stopped for lunch and Debbie arrived shortly there after. We all reloaded on water in preparation for the next 800' climb. And that climb was MUDDY! Wow!We arrived at Manassas Gap Shelter around 5:00 and sat down for a snack. We pulled out maps and discussed whether or not we should simply stay here or continue on to our originally planned Dicks Dome Shelter for the night. That was still 4.5 miles away. We moved on with a quickened pace.Somewhere in that 4.5 miles my trick right knee decided to be tricky (usually downhill while in a hurry) but we managed to arrive at Dicks Dome Shelter before dark. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a barking dog who's owner refused to call off of us. After repeated attempts to get her to call off her dog, I turned Jackson lose and the two dogs worked it out. The original shelter was full but a new shelter was being built up the hill and was only a platform so far. We opted to sleep up the hill on the platform and were later joined by two other hikers. We quickly set to doing chores as the light was fading fast. Strangely Jackson passed out in the tent before dinner, got up when I fed him, and immediately returned to the tent. Huh? OK? Chores done, bear bag hung, nature call taken care of, hit the sack exhausted.","Front Royal, VA

Everyone left camp about the same time, around 8 a.m. In addition to the ill-mannered dog owner lady, her son, the two hikers that stayed with us on the platform, there were a few other unnamed hikers at this shelter last night. We left the shelter NoBo heading straight up with a climb of about 400'. At the top of this climb we entered the Sky Meadows State Park. The muddy trail slowly migrated into a well manicured mowed grass and then into a formal gravel path. It was strange to see local woman/men out exercising in the park in all their fancy running/walking clothes as we slugged along under our heavy packs.The trail turned downhill for 1000' into Ashby Gap where we crossed US 50. Having left Sky Meadows, the trail began to take on the characteristics of the Roller Coaster, a bit rockier and denser woods as we made our way to the VA 601 parking lot. We popped out of the woods into the parking lot and dropped all our gear into my mini-van. We were all excited to see it, even Jackson. We quickly regrouped to make the drive up to Duncannon, PA. I had now officially completed Virginia!!!! Yahoo!The plan was for me to drive us to Duncannon, PA while Debbie did payroll via her cell phone for work. It was a great plan and worked extremely well. It was a 2.5 hour ride and we were headed to the Red Carpet Inn there. Once we arrived, we showered, washed clothes and repacked our backpacks planning for 5 days out. Bob Freeman picked us up at the Red Carpet where we left our van parked. He drove us back and dropped us at Pen Mar County Park in northern Maryland. Enroute we bought him dinner at a Wendy's.We had originally thought we'd able to make the 5 mile hike to Deer Lick Shelter for the night, but by now we were running a tad late and only made the mile hike into the first campsite. We did however celebrated with great fanfare my also officially finishing Maryland today here at Pen Mar!!! It was also exciting to note that all the skipped Sections were now complete and we had finally arrived in Pennsylvania. Every step was now the farthest north I'd ever hiked on the AT. Bring on PA!!!We setup our tents, hung our bear bags, and collapsed into our tents shortly after dusk. There were two other young men here at the campsite.

It was nice to be able to use the privy. This shelter was comprised of two separate, older buildings, each being able to sleep 5 people and was right on the AT. 2.4 miles later, we stopped at the Antietam Shelter and weren't too impressed. We were unable to locate the water source at the Old Forge Picnic Area so moved on to the Tumbling Run Shelters. Pretty classy setup with campfire ring, two newer 8 person shelters, clothes line out back, GREAT tent sites, and a covered picnic table area. We stopped long enough for me to get more water from the great creek. We both used the privy and then made our way up the 1000' climb to Chimney Rocks. We sat and had lunch but neither of us made our way up to the view.It was at this point that a plan to stay at the Trail of Hope Hostel started to form. It meant an additional 3 miles for the day, but we agreed we'd make our final decision at the Rocky Mountain Shelters 5 miles from now. Since those 5 miles went rather smoothly with great terrain, we determined we would have enough daylight left to make the addtional 3 miles but were unable to reach Bob via cell phone. We decided to go for it anyway. It didn't take long for the first of what was to become many rocks of Pennsylvania to become part of the trail. Debbie had been out in the lead and when I caught up to her, I found her pondering just exactly how one gets through these massive boulder fields. I showed her the best way was to follow the most worn footpath NOT the white blazes in a boulder field. It is the most worn because that is where most of the hikers have been successful at navigating the boulders. But you still have to keep you eye on the blazes in case the worn path becomes a different trail.We cleared that first boulder field and were disappointed to discover that several more were in store. This wasn't good for us making the time we'd estimated with the fading light. Once past all the boulder fields, the trail was good, we got a cell phone signal, we reached Bob, he confirmed they had room at the Hostel for the night, and agreed to pick us up at Hwy 30.Dinner was at 9 p.m. for us. We acquired a small room upstairs with two single beds, each took showers and hit the rack. Just one tiny problem here though. This shelter did not let dogs inside either. Jackson was bedded down in garage outside and made it clear most of the night he wasn't happy about it. :-(In hindsight, we should have slack packed today and stayed at Bob Freeman's hostel in Fayetteville, PA last night as well instead of slugging 5 days of food down the trail (sigh).","Falls Creek Campsite

Breakfast done, most of our gear left in the room, borrowed slack-pack from Bob locked and loaded, and we all piled into Bob's SUV. He whisked us down Hwy 233 to the Pine Grove General Store at the Pine Grove Furnace State Park. We were going to walk the 19.8 miles back to Hwy 30 today. There were several thru-hikers eating a HUGE breakfast at one of the outside tables. We dropped our gear, bought a small snack in the store, and sat and visited. They already had so many great trail stories to share.Debbie and I headed SoBo and got into a great conversation about our personal goals that we wanted to accomplish while hiking the trail this year. Much of it centered around learning about life from each other because at this point we didn't really know each other that well yet.The trail was kind today, not too rocky, not too much elevation. We stopped at the first of several 1/2 way points on the entire AT. Every year the exact mid-point changes due to alterations to the trail. Many pictures were taken at this exciting point in my multi-year adventure. We stopped at Tom's Run Shelters just long enough to sign the log book and moved on. Lunch was at Birch Run Shelter. It was nice and sunny today so we lingered. The climb out of PATC Milesburn Cabin was the steepest part today and wasn't all that bad.We got a bit turned around at the 5-way gravel road intersection as we weren't able to located white blazes. Once back on tract, we headed down into Caledonia State Park and followed the AT up the side of Hwy 30 to yesterday's pickup point. Bob's wife Sandy picked us up and brought us back to the hostel. Now about this deal I'd made with Jackson about not ever being separated again. Well, I planned to sleep out in the garage with him that night. But when we arrived at the hostel, there appeared to be an honored guest there. I did not know the lady nor was I formally introduced but you could just tell that she was well respected at this hostel. I believe she was either a large donor or a past caretaker, it was never clarified. After dinner, this very nice lady discovered that there was ""a dog"" in the garage and that I planned to sleep out there with the dog. She just had to meet this dog. Introductions took an interesting turn as Jackson was quickly being referred to as a Service Dog (and not by me). LOL! That dog was shoved under the covers in my bedroom so fast.....not one peep from him --- ok, so he was snoring he was so happy! Me too!","Pine Grove Furnace SP

Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553039,"In the morning, I hustled Jackson back outside to the garage and got him his breakfast. The Trail of Hope Hostel is associated with a mission. One of the members of the mission was an elderly homeless man who helped Bob around the Hostel and the mission building. He was deaf and Bob and Sally hoped to get him surgery soon. He had taken a liking to Jackson and supervised Jackson's breakfast while I went back inside, ate breakfast and rounded up all my gear with Debbie.Once again we all piled into Bob's SUV and he whisked us down Hwy 233 to the Pine Grove General Store at the Pine Grove Furnace State Park. We headed NoBo through the park using real toilets for the last time for the next few days before skirting Fuller Lake and heading into the forest. The first 1.5 miles were on a level gravel roadbed before the trail turned east and headed up on an old forest rocky road. It was a nice hike to James Fry Shelter where we pulled up a seat to eat lunch.There was an elderly hippy hiker here who was quite full of himself and he talked a mile a minute. All his Trail stories factually added up but he didn't plan to move on today leaving me on the suspicious side so we ate and moved on. We were headed to The Rock Maze today. I didn't have much information about this formation but it sounded daunting. It was late in the afternoon when we arrived. There was a rocky flight of stairs leading up to it and then quite the adventure to follow blazes through massive boulders. Sometimes the trail went up and over and sometimes just around them. We thought we'd finished successfully and then we hit on Part 2. While navigating Part 2, a lady with her yellow lab came jogging past SoBo. She noted she did this stretch of the trail often and disappeared. It was at this point that disaster struck. Poor Debbie misstepped on a series a rocks and did a face plant on the rocks. We patched her together with two first aid kits as the woman jogger and her dog passed us going NoBo. She offered no help.With fading light and concern that Debbie might need stitches, we hustled to the campsite right before Alec Kennedy Shelter. It was a nice campsite along a river and there were three young thru-hikers here. We got pictures out to my husband and determined Debbie didn't need any stitches (whew), made camp, did chores, visited with our new friends and passed out in our tents shortly after dark.","Pine Grove Furnace SP

Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553040,"If yesterday was a tough hiking day for Debbie because of her fall, today was tougher. But she's one tough cookie as she managed to get 18.2 miles of the AT done in addition to the bumps in her game plan. Bump #1 was when she accidentally over-slept but she did a pretty good job of scrambling to catch up hustling up her morning chores. We were the last ones out of camp and Debbie headed out first between us. I returned to the campsite to retrieve a forgotten piece of gear sending Debbie on ahead. Sadly she made novice hiker mistake #2 when she turned SoBo instead of NoBo leaving camp. As I came behind her I turned NoBo with Jackson not knowing her mistake. I hustled along down the trail under the belief that she was in front of me and was quite surprised to not catch up with her.As the woods gave way to the Cumberland Valley so did the trail give way to a nice dirt trail with wide open spaces. After a few 90 degree bends in the path in various fields, the trail wound its way into Boiling Springs. We made our way past Children's Lake where Jackson shed his backpack and took a quick dip much to the dismay of a few ducks and geese. I began to doubt that Debbie was in front of me so we made a stop at the ATC Mid-Atlantic Regional Office to use the restroom and eat 2nd breakfast. We lingered waiting for Debbie while we considered making a brief detour for ice cream. Since it wasn't much fun to without Debbie, we turned East and headed out of town.The trail continued through a narrow band of dense trees with farm fields on either side for a few miles. Occasionally we would walk through one of the fields and then drop back into a new narrow band of trees. Mid-day with still no Debbie I began to search for a spot for lunch. I was both growing worried and sore, it was time to stop and take my boots off for a lunch rest. So I pulled up a seat on a narrow bridge that crossed a small stream and stripped my boots and socks off. Shortly after arriving, Debbie arrived from behind me!!! I heard her saga about having turned SoBo out of camp. Fortunately, she hadn't gone very far SoBo before she stopped and got herself turned back around NoBo. Sadly, at the 90 degree bends in the first set of cornfields, Debbie made Novice Hiker Mistake #3, missed one of the turns and had hiked quite a long distance in the wrong direction before again sorting her location out and getting back on the right track. It was then that I learned that she had literally not stopped walking to this point ALL DAY!!! She had been worried about catching me. Poor thing. As my lunch break was over, I headed out before Debbie. She stayed to rest. Mid-afternoon, I waited for her to catch me at a difficult creek crossing so I could help her cross. She had gotten turned around for a 3rd time that day so I was glad I'd waited. She was really racking up the miles.We crossed over I-76 & I-81 together arriving at the Scott Farm Trail ATC Crew HQ for a late afternoon snack.After crossing under the PA 944 via a tunnel, the trail heads up to Darlington Shelter. As daylight began to fade I found myself out in front of Debbie as she was pretty spent. I located the Shelter and two tent spots for us for the night. I quickly got setup and then when Debbie arrived helped her with her chores. We ate a hasty dinner and Debbie's hard day finally came to a quiet and successful end.","Alec Kennedy Shelter

As we headed out, we had to walk right past the shelter and briefly stopped to chat with a few hikers. We haven't really connected with anyone yet on the trail but the last 3 days were hiked in a NoBo contiguous sequence so it was likely to happen soon. OG Bob as we came to know him later and a young solo woman hiker asked us about our plans when we got into town. We noted that The Doyle was a little to rugged for us and we planned to stay at the Red Carpet Inn. OG Bob's ears perked at the sound of something more accommodating. We were the first ones out of camp this morning! Pretty good for us!Second breakfast was at the top of our first climb, a pipeline with a nice view. It was sunny and pleasant and we lingered on the rocks sunning ourselves and taking pictures. We made our way to Hawk Rock and stopped for a long time in the shade enjoying the beautiful view and once again taking photos.The trail down into Duncannon was very rocky and comprised of rock steps. I got pretty far out in front of Debbie as rocks are not her forte. Jackson and I dropped down onto Inn Road and walked up to the Sherman Creek bridge. The AT had been re-routed in the recent past and if Debbie happened on the old route, I didn't want to miss her reaching Inn Road. Once reunited we went under US 11/15 and made our way to The Doyle Hotel. Duncannon is a very old Appalachian community with narrow streets, quaint houses, and lots of little shops. Once at The Doyle we were greeted by OG Bob looking at his guide and anxious to join us on our ride to the motel. After calling for our ride and discovering it would be a bit before they arrived, we all went inside and had something to drink at this very historic hotel. The Inn keepers have an interesting reputation and it was exciting to finally meet them. Once again, dogs are not allowed inside due to it being a restaurant, but Jackson was aloud to stay in the hallway tied to our packs where he could see us.The Red Carpet driver arrived and whisked us to our hotel. We secured our room, loaded up the washing machine, emptied out gear from my mini-van, took showers and began a routine of packing for the next stretch of the trail. Jackson's backpack was muddy so I washed it out and laid it outside in the sun to dry. Jackson has been extremely hungry this year so I've decided to increase his food and feed him his normal ration 3 x's per day instead of 2 x's. Even found a store with his brand of food today while in town to make this addition possible.Once repacked, we jumped in my mini-van and drove up to Hamburg, PA to leave it at the Microtel. We planned to arrive here 4 days from now. We hit up Walmart for resupply and then caught a ride with Pastor Jason Stump. He took us through a fast food drive through so we could catch dinner as it was now after 7 p.m. He drove us the hour back to Duncannon and the Red Carpet Inn. Once back at the Inn, I discovered in our final repack that Jackson's backpack had been left in my mini-van which was now 4 days away. (Deep sigh). I now had 10 lbs of his gear/food and no way to carry it. It wasn't even going to fit in my backpack if I carried it. This was not good. With no time to retrieve it, it was lights out and there were plenty of dreams about how to possibly manage this one!","Darlington Shelter

We'll be there in three days, just enough time to bounce a mail drop forward with some of our food so I don't have to carry it all there!!! Problem solved, at least for today. Once dropped back at the Doyle along with OG Bob in the morning, the trail went right past the Post Office. We just stopped in, fill a Large Flat Rate box and mailed it off to Pastor. Thank you Pastor!!! Jackson was cleared to be a slacker! We then made our way toward our very tough 1000' climb for the day out of the Duncannon valley. All indications from the AT Guide led us to believe that we could make it 16.1 miles today. The hiker bubble that we were now in were of two different minds than heading for this 16.1 mile out campsite. First there was the smart group that had stayed at the Doyle and had enlisted Trail Angel Mary to bring them their backpacks at PA 225. They were all slack packing and moving fast up that 1000' foot climb. The second group were all heading for an 11 mile day, carrying their full backpacks and planning to only reach Peters Mountain Shelter. Both the climb and the now rock littered trail put us in the second group. 16.1 miles was NOT going to happen.It was a beautiful view at the first powerline but there was no time to lingering. The trail was very rocky and tricky to negotiate. Keeping watch for blazes was a constant vigil until PA 225 where the trail turned into a wide path that was used by locals walking up to Table Rock for the stunning views. We found a young man spending the night right out on the rock ledge at Table Rock. Debbie decided to give her husband Mark a call as she had great cell reception there. It was getting late and I volunteered to make the mile hike onto Peters Mountain Shelter and secure us a spot at the shelter while Debbie stayed at Table Rock to make her call.Upon arriving at the shelter and assessing the number of hikers and the large size of the shelter and the forecast for rain, I confirmed with others that they'd be ok if I stayed in the shelter with a dog. This was something I wasn't always fond of doing as a dog in a shelter can many times be much more trouble than its worth. So I staked out two spots in the lower of a double decker shelter and set about making myself and Jackson some dinner. Water here was slim as it was a long hike down to the water source. While making dinner, I discovered that OG Bob was here. He was staying in his hammock. He made conversation at the picnic table with a new hiker to me, Veggie Guy. Why that name? He was a vegan with a large quantity of vegetables with him. He offered me a few carrots from his full carrot bag as we ate. He was flip-flop thru-hiking and had just recently started at Harper's Ferry. 1/2 way through dinner he asked me where my hiking partner was? Oh shit!!! Where's Debbie? And it's getting dark out now!!! Veggie Guy started down the trail toward Table Rock while I tried to reach her on her phone. A few moments later, Veggie Guy and Debbie came walking into the shelter. OG Bob, chided her about her heavy pack as Debbie explained she'd gotten almost to the shelter but doubting herself she'd turned around and went back to the Table Rock to confirm she'd gone in the right direction and then had to re-walk the mile back to the shelter. OG Bob dumped her pack out on the picnic table and by the light of headlamps he and Veggie Guy went through Debbie's gear and made some recommendations on what she could leave behind. It was official, we now had two new hiker friends on this year's adventure!","Duncannon, PA

No real views, no unusual anomalies about the trail, no rain, no cold, no heat, no bugs, just rocks, walking and a 1100' climb. Up to this point, Debbie (new trail name Hobbit) and I had easily been able to pull 15-20 mile days even though we were fresh to the trail. But this ""work"" limited us to only 13.4 miles and landed us with the same group of hikers from last night at the Yellow Springs Campsite.Early afternoon, we started hearing loud booms and rapid gunfire far off in the distance to our right (1 o'clock). It continued throughout the rest of the day getting louder and louder BOOM! Rapid gunfire. It was almost like there was military training going on. By they time we arrived at camp we were very near the grounds where the training was taking place. The BOOMS were extremely loud. Hope this wasn't going to go on all night? By 7 p.m. it ceased! Whew!I knew today was a lot of work but my little buddy Waterboy was seeming unusually tired. Odd actually. Was he running back and forth between Hobbit and I too much? We didn't always hike together, sometimes as much as 1/2 mile or more apart. Waterboy would run back and forth between us to keep an on both of us. His paw pads were in pretty good shape, I'd been massaging them with Mushers to keep them soft and supple. As soon as the tent went up, he jumped in and passed out not even eating his bully stick (a favorite treat). He did come out briefly to down his dinner and my left overs (ok, appetite is good), but it started sprinkling as dinner was getting wrapped up so he passed back out in the tent.

Numerous decisions we later couldn't take back made on both mine and Hobbit's part got us 15.30 miles down the trail but it was a LONG day. It was cool and drizzly when we packed up in the morning. Hobbit opted to pack and get moving down the trail without breakfast in an attempt to warm up. She had decided not to bring under armour and was bit under dressed for 45 and drizzle. I tossed down some hot chocolate and oatmeal, packed and hit the trail about 1/2 hour after her. At least Jackson wasn't going to walk back and forth between us this way.The trail continued with smaller rocks and mud but gently sloped down as we approached Rausch Creek. The trail turned to crushed black gravel of anthracite. This area was an old coal mining town that failed. Quite historical. http://www.stonyvalley.com/rauschgap.html We passed up the side trail to Rausch Gap Shelter and stopped at Rausch Creek to watch the Limestone neutralization system in action, it is a system to clean up the acid mine drainage that pollutes the local creeks. While we watched, Veggie Guys hiking buddy Josh (Mason Jar) caught up with us. We stopped just past the cemetery for second breakfast and Josh and I had a great conversation about hiking / resting / hiking rhythm techniques and to discuss why my backpack was waterlogged even though I'd kept the cover on it.As Waterboy and I reached the bottom of Second Mountain, nature called and I dropped my pack to take care of business. Back on the trail we were about to cross over/under a sequence of roads when Hobbit caught up to us. Wait! You were behind us? She had gotten concerned about hypothermia and had stopped at the Rausch Gap Shelter (0.3 mile off the trail) to dry out a bit and warm up. When Waterboy and I never showed up, she packed up and again headed down the trail. Our new plan now was to stop for the day at the next campsite that was about 2.0 more miles and call it an early day. Both Hobbit and Waterboy needed an early day with some rest. As we passed several campsites both Hobbit and I said we didn't care for the site, let's look for a better one. They were all small for 2 tents, under heavy canopy, and too near the trail. This lack of decision caused us to end up at the I-81 underpass with the next horrid climb dead in front of us. We climbed to the next gravel road crossing and sat down for a makeshift lunch. We'd heard some really bad things about this climb and now had it staring us in the face when we all had hoped to be napping in our tents.Then we climbed, and climbed, and climbed and it was STEEP. But we were extremely proud of ourselves when we summited. Ok, back to looking for a great campsite right? Wrong! There were huge rocks everywhere! Along the trail and every open space was littered with them. We were NOT going to get a tent setup here. So we were back to the indecision about which site to pick and just kept walking. At one point we lost the blazes and that caused some concern. But how far away can they be if you are on top of a huge cigar shaped mountain walking down the spine of it, right? After a brief bit of chaos, we were back on the trail and once again heading NoBo. The only thing on our AT Guide map was this abandoned powerline overlook. We crossed our fingers and just kept moving. Upon arrival, we received a great welcome by OG Bob!!!! Wowser!!! He was very impressed we'd made it that far and so were we.We found the only level spot we could squishing our tents tight together. I dumped what little was left in my food bag on the ground and took inventory. It appeared Jackson was going to eat people food for dinner. Hobbit and I fed him every scrap we could, big hunks of cheese, beef jerky, left overs, granola bars.... he ate it all. He was SO hungry. Hang in there buddy, tomorrow we'll be at the 501 Shelter and your food is there!Plans had been brewing throughout the day for my girlfriend Grace to meet us at the 501 Shelter tomorrow. She was on her way home to Wisconsin from a class reunion in New York. We were to have dinner together. I formed a plan instead that included Grace just driving us to Hamburg and skipping the next 24.4 miles past the 501 Shelter. Hobbit needed to warm up and dry out and Waterboy was a tired mess. I was growing quite concerned. This new game plan was starting to sound like a reallly good idea. Ok guys, tomorrow we hike 6.8 miles and the day after that's a ZERO!!! I got NO complaints!

He is doing well, hydrated and loosing only a little weight. But he's exhausted and his pads are getting worn out. And now with it getting warm I'm much more worried about rattlers. Poor tired puppy!Jackson UPDATE: Please see the 1st entry in the 2017 Journal. Jackson ended up testing positive for Lyme's disease in Oct. 2016 which I believe he had since February or March of 2016. His getting tired on this trip was one of several signs he wasn't 100%.","Abandoned Powerline Campsite

Without even being invited in Jackson jumped in and made himself comfortable up on the bench seat! He was DONE and he was going home and he didn't care if mom was coming or not. LOL Thank you Grace!Hobbit and I spent the day resting, repacking, drying out tents, doing laundry, re-suppy at Walmart and Cabelas, and dinner at The Cracker Barrel. I was so missing my little black hiking buddy, but received word that he and Grace had stopped for the night and he was doing nothing but sleeping. Awwww......","Zero in Hamburg, PA

Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553047,"Quick continental breakfast, check out of the hotel, and off we are in the mini-van to The Mechanical Man Stempa's home. We picked him up and drove back to the AT trailhead in Port Clinton where he dropped us off and then drove my mini-van to his home for safe storage. From this point, it was all UP for the next 1000'.The climb into Pulpit rock was steep, rocky and so worth it. About 1/2 way up, a group of young Jewish boys passed me. It appeared they were on their Senior trip. Once at the top, they all posed for a picture that I snapped for them. Then one of the boys snapped a picture of Hobbit and I. We investigated the Astronomical Park and privy and then headed out to The Pinnacle. The trek between the Pulpit and the Pinnacle was all large boulders which once again made it difficult to follow the blazes. The trail narrowed once off the boulders and followed the ridge line around to the north. As we approached the Pinnacle there was a huge pile of boulders marking the way out to the view. We dropped our packs and worked our way through the boulders. Someone noted that a rattler had been spotted earlier but we never saw one. We paused long enough for a lunch. Hobbit headed out first. Boulders aren't her forte and she wanted to get a jump on the next leg. I felt bad for her when I met her on the trail as it swung westward. She was walking back toward the Pinnacle. I got her turned around and we hiked together for a while. The trail had turned into more of an old road bed and Hobbit quickly out paced me and disappeared.I was short on water and stopped to resupply at Panther Creek. It was a beautiful spot so I lingered. A hiker going SoBo informed me that he'd seen Hobbit and that I needed to watch for the trail as it broke from the roadbed and headed west. Hobbit had reached the Eckville Shelter and texted me noting she would investigate space inside the shelter. A later text reveled that there was one top bunk left and Hobbit had snagged it. Veggie Guy was there and directions on how to find the shelter from the trail were shared. The shelter is a small shed, completely enclosed type structure in the back yard of a private residence. There is a picnic table and separate building with a toilet and shower. Two tent pads were located across the street in a quiet, nicely mowed 1/2 acre. There was one tent pad left and I snag that. Hobbit and I had dinner after dark, hung our bear bags on a hook in the back of the shelter and crashed. I received word that Grace had successfully delivered Jackson to Loretta's, he was checked over, and sent to Waukesha to the plumbing shop via Rosemary. Rumor has it that he was extactic to see Bandit, Dave, and Cheryl. I have such great dog friends to rescue my baby! Thanks guys!","PA 61 Parking, Port Clinton, PA

Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553048,"It was nice to have it a bit warmer now than last week. It was a beautiful morning and we were all on the trail together early, Veggie Guy, Hobbit and I. The climb to Dans Pulpit was no picnic but we were getting used to the boulder climbs now. Second breakfast was at Dans Pulpit with a beautiful view. We all signed the log book and moved on. Veggie Guy was in the lead, then myself followed by Hobbit as we worked our way over boulders. Veggie Guy stepped up and over a boulder mound and disappeared in front of me. I opted to take a slightly different path up the boulder mound and jumped when I saw the rattler in my path and I started backing up very quickly telling Hobbit to backup with a sense of urgency!!! He never rattled. As to not upset the snake, I first attempted to go around him on the left but that didn't appear to be a good option. Next I tried going around him to the right. While doing this, I kept my eye on him. A few steps into my plan I heard off to my right (3 o'clock) something that sounded like leaves rattling and I froze. Holy crap it was another rattler and I could no longer contain myself. I screamed as I backed up to Hobbit a 2nd time. Veggie Guy had just walked up this boulder mound past two rattlers and neither snake had warned him. We ended up going around both snakes to the left but I was very cautious around boulders and crevices for the remainder of our Section hike! Wow!There were some spectacular boulder mounds that Hobbit and I had to negotiate on the remainder of our way to the Allentown Hiking Club Shelter. At this point the trail had once again turned into an old roadbed and was easier to negotiate. We stopped at the spring past the shelter to resupply on water. Strangely I walked past Veggie Guys backpack on the side of the trail and just assumed he was taking care of nature's call. However, when Hobbit and I arrived at the spring, there was Veggie Guy taking a nap in cool grass by the spring. He'd taken a different route in for water.AT PA 309 Veggie Guy stopped in at the restaurant for a salad. Unfortunately, I missed his text and walked right past staying on the trail. The heat was not doing me any good and I was needing to take breaks more frequently so Hobbit was now out in front and Veggie Guy was behind. As I sat and cooled off in the middle of the trail, Veggie Guy hiked passed. We were all headed to the Powerline New Tripoli Campsite. It was a very nice grassy site. We opted to stay on the south side of the powerline, though the campsite was technically on the north side. Veggie Guy volunteered to go for water and must have carried 60 lbs of water back to our campsite for all three of us!!! Thank you Veggie Guy! Hobbit and I setup our tents and I attempted a bear hang. We all had diner with a great sunset.","Eckville Shelter

Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553049,"Today was going to be both exciting AND a workout. We had the Knife Edge, Bear Rocks, and Bake Oven Knob on tap. ALL ROCKS! LOTS OF THEM! Then it would be off to Lehigh Gap. Hobbit and I woke to find Veggie Guy already packed and gone. He texted us to say be careful on Knife's Edge, that the rocks were slippery from the overnight rain we'd received. We packed and made our way down to the Knife Edge. I was excited and Hobbit was nervous. But we made our way slowly across, one boulder at a time, not rushing it! AND WE DID IT! It was a ton of fun!Bear Rocks wasn't quite so dramtic. However, the climb into Bake Oven Knob was a project. Rock boulder steps again like the Pulpit. We stopped for a break and a snack at the top to both rest and enjoy the view. There were a lot of day hikers here enjoying the climb, view, and sun. But Hobbit and I were in for a surprise. We hadn't expected Bake Oven Knob on the backside to be as hard as the Knife Edge but it was very difficult to negotiate. As we were pondering how to negotiate one particular section, an elderly gentleman and his wife literally came skipping past. I told the woman that her technique was amazing and it was. She was like a little spider hoping from rock to rock using her poles for great balance! Wow!To finish off the Bake Oven Knob stretch Hobbit and I stopped at the Bake Oven Knob Shelter for lunch and here was this great couple that had just passed us. We would come to know them as Chatterbox and Graham. They were both from London, had started their flip-flop in Boiling Springs, and Graham had thru-hiked in 2006. Chatterbox is a very charismatic hiker and we almost instantly became friends. The trail turned to an old forest road for the remainder of the trek to George W. Outerbridge Shelter which made for a nice hike down the AT. When we arrived at the shelter, Chatterbox and Graham were there and we sat for a snack and some good conversation while they made dinner. They planned to spend the night at this shelter.Hobbit and I pressed on and dropped out on the PA 873 crossing the bridge over to the Lehigh Gap side of Lehigh River. Veggie Guy had been waiting for us down by the river for quite a while and he joined us on the north end of the bridge. We all walked up to the Superfund Trailhead and waited for Mechanical Man to pick us up. Mechanical Man suggested the Kunkletown Pub as a good place for dinner and we stopped there on the way to his residence where we spent the night. It was a great dinner and we all ate too much, Veggie Guy, Hobbit, Canary, and Mechanical Man. We then made our way to Mechanical Man's residence where he has his garage setup for hikers to spend the night.","New Tripoli Campsite

Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553050,"We had originally planned to hike one more day but decided that today would be enough hiking for 2016. We planned to just hike the hard part of this leg so we wouldn't have to face it again in 2017. Today is the Lehigh Gap climb!!! We got a bit of late start as there were a lot of hikers here at Mechanical Man's house. Mechanical Man drove myself, Hobbit, and Veggie Guy to the Superfund Trailhead and dropped us there. Then Mechanical Man made sure my mini-van got parked at the parking area on Little Gap Road. Veggie Guy put his backpack and some extra water in my mini-van and took a key to the van so he could pick it up on his way past the van. He was going to continue on NoBo on the AT even though Hobbit and I would be heading home.As we prepared to head out at the Superfund Trailhead up walked Chatterbox and Graham. We all chattered excitedly about this climb. Chatterbox, Graham, and Veggie Guy disappeared quickly up the trail while Hobbit and I took our time. We were methodical and stopped often to enjoy the view from this fabulous spot. It was very rocky and very steep and I was very happy that Waterboy was NOT with us. There were parts where you had to use finger and toe holds to pull yourself up to the next ledge. At one particularly hard part, Hobbit's arm reach was too short and I had to reach down and grab her backpack and assist her to the next reach. We were pretty proud of ourselves when we got past the hard parts. This was by far the hardest point for me thus far on the trail. Squirrel tells me that it is going to get harder!!! Voi! Voi!It was very hot today and as I'd noted earlier I don't do well in the heat. It was truly a good day for a short hike as much of this leg was completely out in the open. Lehigh Gap has been stripped of its foliage due to the zinc smelting done there from 1898-1980. Hobbit got turned around at one point but was able to catch back up with me before we reached my mini-van. We were elated to have completed our 2016 Section Hike and headed to the nearest ice cream stand for some tasty, high calorie treats.After washing up a tad in the restroom, we headed the van back down to Lehigh Gap to experience the Gap via car. Very impressive. We then took the I-476 through the Lehigh Valley Tunnel just to take in the vastness of where we had hiked yesterday. After our detour we headed the van NoBo toward home pulling out GPSs to see just where we were. We were amazed at both how close we were to New York City and just how far HOME was. We drove until dinner time, got a hotel room, and caught an AYCE dinner. Wow a full tummy, bed, shower and AC sure can feel great!","Lehigh Gap

But today was the conclusion to our 2016 AT Section Hike. It was a long but uneventful trip back to Wisconsin. We had laid down an impressive 214.1 miles without incident and Hobbit had survived her first long distance hike.Chatterbox, Graham, Veggie Guy, and Josh summited Katahdin, did their flip-flops and finished their thru-hikes at Springer in October. I followed their trip for the rest of the summer with great joy for their adventure.
