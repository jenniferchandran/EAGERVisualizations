Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479943,"I am going to do this. I am going to hike approximately 2,200 miles from Georgia to Maine on the Appalacian Trail. My journey is as of right now set to begin on April 1, 2016. This gives me 15 months to transform this life long ""bucket list"" item into a challenge that I can not only complete, but also enjoy completing. The outdoors are not new to me. I have spent many days and nights in the woods; hunting, trapping and fishing. More recently my time in the woods has been spent on our farm in East Texas performing land stewardship projects, making the place a good place for wildlife. During my outdoor adventures I have spent many nights in tents, can build a fire and things like bears, snakes and the dark don't freak me out. Despite having complete comfort in my outdoors skills, I have very little hiking experience and nothing in the way of hiking and camping over long periods of time. I have now started to purchase my equipment (hunting gear has nothing on ultra light hiking gear). So far I have very little, but this is why I am heading out in 2016. My goal is to have most of my equipment before this April. I plan to do a test hike in the summer of 2015 and pull off a hike/fly fishing boondoggle somewhere out west. I hope you all come along...",,Let's get on with the show....,"Jan 07, Wed",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479965,"I found this overview of the AT on several other blogs... so I figured there was no harm in shamelessly kyping it for my second entry. I thought the overview was good for anyone who was tuning into my blog who was not familiar with the AT. The Appalachian Trail is one of the longest continuously marked footpath in the world, measuring roughly 2,180 miles in length. The Trail goes through fourteen states along the crests and valleys of the Appalachian mountain range from the southern terminus at Springer Mountain, Georgia, to the Trail’s northern terminus at Katahdin, Maine.Known as the “A.T.,” it has been estimated that 2-3 million people visit the Trail every year and about 1,800–2,000 people attempt to “thru-hike” the Trail. People from across the globe are drawn to the A.T. for a variety of reasons: to reconnect with nature, to escape the stress of city life, to meet new people or deepen old friendships, or to experience a simpler life.The A.T. was completed in 1937 and is a unit of the National Park System. The A.T. is managed under a unique partnership between the public and private sectors that includes, among others, the National Park Service (NPS), the USDA Forest Service (USFS), an array of state agencies, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, and 31 local Trail-maintaining clubs.Fun Facts•The Trail is roughly 2,180 miles long, passing through 14 states.•Thousands of volunteers contribute roughly 220,000 hours to the A.T. every year.•More than 250 three-sided shelters exist along the Trail.•Virginia is home to the most miles of the Trail (about 550), while West Virginia is home to the least (about 4).•Maryland and West Virginia are the easiest states to hike; New Hampshire and Maine are the hardest.•The total elevation gain of hiking the entire A.T. is equivalent to climbing Mt. Everest 16 times.•The A.T. is home to an impressive diversity of plants and animals. Some animals you may see include black bears, moose, porcupines, snakes, woodpeckers, and salamanders. Some plants you may encounter include jack-in-the-pulpit, skunk cabbage, and flame azalea.Hikers•About 2 to 3 million visitors walk a portion of the A.T. each year.•The A.T. has hundreds of access points and is within a few hours drive of millions of Americans, making it a popular destination for day-hikers.•“Thru-hikers” walk the entire Trail in a continuous journey. “Section-hikers” piece the entire Trail together over years. “Flip-floppers” thru-hike the entire Trail in discontinuous sections to avoid crowds, extremes in weather, or start on easier terrain.•1 in 4 who attempt a thru-hike successfully completes the journey•Most thru-hikers walk north, starting in Georgia in spring and finishing in Maine in fall, taking an average of 6 months.•Foods high in calories and low in water weight, such as Snickers bars and Ramen Noodles, are popular with backpackers, who can burn up to 6,000 calories a day.•Hikers usually adopt “trail names” while hiking the Trail. They are often descriptive or humorous. Examples are “Eternal Optimist,” “Thunder Chicken,” and “Crumb-snatcher"".",,About the AT,"Jan 08, Thu",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480060,"This posting to my blog is the third posting and that means I now “go live” and my postings are visible to the world. A question I am asked, usually the first question, when I share with people that I plan to hike the AT is…,”why”?   Up until recently my answer was somewhat vague and a bit shallow…,”ahh, it is something I always wanted to do”.Recently I read Appalachian Trials by Zach Davis and took stock about what Zach said about people who drop out early. He was pretty clear in stressing that anyone attempting to walk 2,200 miles will at some point find themselves wet, cold and standing in a place they at that moment do not want to be in. It’s at that point when one might bail on the entire journey. Not wanting to quit, I thought deeply about why I wanted to do the AT so that I had better answers for those low moments and they are outlined below.Intrigued with the trail – I have always been intrigued by the AT ever since I biked across it on a four day mountain bike camping trip 20 years ago. The thought of doing the entire hike from Georgia to Maine just kind of grabbed me. I mean, anyone could hike and camp for a few days, this is an epic journey. Personal goal/challenge – An intrigue is one thing, but having the physical strength is another. Then again, the mental strength is even another factor. I am going into this journey in good health, but whether or not my body can handle it is a complete mystery. Mentally most people I know would say I am relatively sane, but can I stayed focused for that long?    That being said, I look forward to both the physical and mental challenges.Experience a full summer outdoors from spring to fall – This stroll will take six months, April to September. Along the way will be early spring and summer, July 4th, mid and late summer and early fall. It’s difficult to put in words, but being outdoors through this time span just sounds cool. As an added bonus, it is good to NOT be in Texas in July, August and September.East Coast – When I was 16 I moved from New Jersey to Texas (can anyone say culture shock)? Since then a good portion of my outdoors experiences have been west of the Mississippi Don’t get me wrong, I have experienced some amazingly cool places in the western United States; Yellowstone, Yosemite, Bryce Canyon, Zion, Death Valley and of course Deep East Texas, but I have not spend enough time on the East Coast in the woods. Here is my chance to do it. I especially look forward to waking the 76 miles of the AT in my home state of New Jersey.Meet people – The second question I am asked after “why” is “are you doing it with anyone else”. As of now I am planning to kick off on the 1st of April 2016… alone. But is anyone really alone hiking the AT? It does not seem so, especially starting in April 1st! I anticipate meeting all kinds of good people and hopefully know some of these people for a long time. Its part of the reason why I am going now, I will be neither the youngest nor the oldest on the trail. I can enjoy the experiences and the friendships longer this way.Take a breather mid-way through life – So far my 48 years on this planet have been good. Real good. Sure, there has been a bummer or two, but there is a whole lot better than there is worse. So I am not embarking on the journey to shake of any recent bad luck or anything like that (and I have gotten over that New Jersey to Texas move a long time ago). I like to look at this as a break in the middle of the ride to take a breather and process all the good and whatever bad and see if something that I can use during the rest of my life bubbles to the surface. Something new – I have started to research and buy my equipment and it’s all new to me, despite the fact I consider myself an avid outdoorsman. Long distance hiking and the associated camping is a totally different game than schlepping all your stuff into deer camp and bulking up in layers and layers of camouflage in order to stay warm while sitting in a tree perfectly still. That being said, all my hunting, fishing and camping gear that I own (and it is a lot) does not make the cut for the journey. I have learned a lot about ultra-light hiking and camping gear so far and I suspect I will learn more before it is all over.So those are the reasons I am attempting a thru hike of the AT. And besides, think of the stories one can tell…",,Why?,"Jan 10, Sat",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481149,"I wrote this after my trip to the REI garage sale back in January. I am deep in the equipment buying mode, so I thought I would share this. Its intended to be a humorous description of a what was a humorous experience....At some point in any wanna-be AT hiker’s transition from a “this is something on my bucket list that I want to do” fantasy to the point of actually purchasing the necessary gear, the wallet busting ugly truth about the cost of hiking equipment light enough to be humped 2,200 miles becomes a dreaded reality. For me, the epiphany occurred in the REI store located on Highway 242 in Tomball, Texas. It was two days after Christmas 2014 and lucky for me my brother Chris and his son Kyle were there to prop me up when I made the shocking discovery that the sleeping bag that I had been directed to, an REI 20 degree down Igneo Long, could be part of my journey for only three hundred and nineteen dollars. Shit, I don’t think my mattress at home cost that much! In an attempt to calm my frugal nerves we made our way into the clothing section via the sporks and other neat stuff aisle.    Being cold on my hike worries me, being wet and cold scares the hell out me. Luckily, the good folks at Arc’teryk feel the same way and were kind enough to offer a solution, the three hundred and fifty dollar Beta Hybrid jacket. In Arc’teryk’s words this is a “durable waterproof/breathable hard shell that’s super lightweight and packs down small.” All I could think was for this kind of loot this thing better not only keep you dry in a rain shower it should be able to actually control the weather!For a grand total of seven hundred and three dollars “out the door price” I could have walked out with two essential items crossed off my things to buy list or I could have stood there with look off sheer sticker price fear. I chose to do the later and it must be the look REI sales people are trained to recognize as our guy Pete was there to talk me down from what “insiders” must refer to as the REI ledge. “If you are not doing your hike until 2016 don’t buy anything today”, he said in a hushed tone, “we have sales coming up”. Then he leaned in closer and dropped his tone down to that “I am fixing to tell you where the secret fishing hole is” level and proceeded to tell me about the REI garage sale which amazingly enough was to be held on Sunday January 4th, less than a week away.   I thanked Pete for the hot tip and wrapped up what quickly went from shopping trip to scouting mission. As we left the store I felt as if I once again beat the system.Everyone loves a garage sale. Social and economic levels cast aside, everyone wants a deal. Add to the euphoria of a good deal to the fact that you are snatching an expensive piece of light weight hiking gear from “the man” for half the retail price and it’s a feeling better than the first pangs of an epic orgasm. And so what if the stuff is returned, it can’t be crap or REI would not resell it, or so I thought. My second flawed assumption was that something as hokey as a retail garage sale would be a low key affair. It would be me and a few other cheap-skates and college kids scrounging for some very useable yet criminally cheap treasures. At the Highway 242 location my inside man Pete suggested I head to the REI Megastore in Houston since they were more likely to have a greater selection of returned gear. To sweeten the deal the Megastore, located at the intersection of Westheimer and Voss, was located just fifteen minutes from my house. Acting on flawed assumptions I hit the parking lot at 9:30 am, thirty minutes before the store opened. It’s said that the early bird always gets worm and today I was unfortunately not the early bird. As I pulled in I was greeted by what could best be described as a line of humanity that started at the front door of the Megastore and wound its way past the Petco and around the corner. Remaining optimistic I tried to believe that Petco was holding some kind of pet adoption day in conjunction with the garage sale, but that was not the case. The majority of those in line sported a jacket logoed with Patagonia, Marmot, North Face or Columbia, no doubt grabs from previous garage sales.   As I parked my truck I could see that those who held the coveted front of the line positions appeared to be breaking camp. Camping out so that you could be first in line to buy more camping gear, does anyone see the irony in this? The thing about a long line is that it always gets longer. Resisting the urge to abort the mission and head to the nearest Starbucks I schlepped to the back of the line on the side of the Petco where I could not even see the Megastore. And the line just kept growing.Taking place in line behind me was an older gentleman and his wife. He sported a Marmot pullover and seemed sincere enough. Having already ripped through a big cup of coffee on my drive over I was up for a chat and besides, with a line like the one we had just joined, we were going be there for a while. His name was Tim and he was from Baytown, Texas. I never did get his wife’s name. Tim declared that he was planning to hike the AT. What were the chances that the very next bargain hunter in line was also prepping for a journey of a lifetime? He then waivered a bit and said he might consider the PCT instead. We talked for a while and the line started to move. Evidently the Megastore doors had opened. Tim seemed very knowledgeable about gear. He discussed his start date was uncertain because his early retirement from Exxon/Mobil ended when his former employee realized that they just couldn’t go on refining gasoline without him. With what appeared to be no lack of funds, I asked him why he drove all the way from Baytown, Texas to stand in line with the masses to which he had no answer. Everyone wants a deal.With a conversation centered around the mutually agreeable subject of light weight hiking gear, the time slipped by and we soon found ourselves at the gateway to the Megastore. And as triumphant as entering the store may sound, it only meant further waiting as the line snaked through the entire store and into the back lot where already at least two hundred penny conscious outdoor enthusiasts scrambled to grab what was worth grabbing. I would later find out the strategy for these early birds was to quickly grab stuff that might be useful and take the time to inspect it as the feeding frenzy died down. As we approached the entrance to the back of the store Tim suggested Trailjournals.com if I was interested in following hikers blogs in the 2015 hiking season. Not knowing it then, other than the friendly conversation with Tim, this would be the only thing tangible or intangible I would leave REI with on this day.Then suddenly I was the next in line. To say I was excited would be an overstatement. At this point I just wanted to see if perhaps there was something left behind that might be useful. My mental list of equipment that I still required was long as at this point in preparations I basically had my Gregory Z65 backpack and an MSR spork.   My chances of success were multiplied by the long list of needs, but I would have to work fast. The gatekeeper suggested I head straight to the back lot where the tents and camping booty was stashed. I slipped through the warehouse by-passing racks of shoes and boots and bins of miscellaneous stuff. Reaching the back lot I was greeted with a horde of people taking down tents and packing up their pile of gear gotten when the getting was good. With the exception the absence of beer cans lying about, the scene was remmissnace of the morning after the last day of the Lockin Music Festival I attended two years earlier. Come to think of it, I probably could have ground scored more useful gear at the music festival than what was left in the Megastore’s back lot. Don’t get me wrong, I do believe the first in-liners found some bargains and walked away with some deals, but anything worth grabbing was already grabbed. As I walked past a small pile of returned air mattresses which did not seem to go in the first or second wave or gear grabs, I promised myself to work a little bit harder in 2015 and buy new gear.With prospects of tripping over a near mint four hundred dollar tent for fifty bucks fading fast, I launched into exit mode. As I passed back through the warehouse I felt that pull that all humans are powerless against…. the need to rifle through the bargain bin. What compels us to stoop to such levels? Is it because every once and a while we pull a rabbit out of the hat? And there I stood amongst all the other shoppers who fought the urge and lost. Then I found what appeared to be a rabbit or in this case a cool light weight beanie. Further investigation indicated my new treasure had a hole gnawed in it (probably by a rabbit). Then a Black Diamond headlamp with a return tags on it. This thing looked like it was submerged in a pond for a week or so. I passed. Finally, a pair of walking sticks. Oh the stories these things could tell! With that I concluded I had landed in the REI’s land of misfit hiking equipment. I broke free of the weakening magnetic force field and made a break to safety or in this case the main showroom. As I emerged empty handed I was surprised to see a long line of eager shoppers waiting for their turn to pick through racks of worn in hiking boots and whatever remained in the bargain bin.Don’t get me wrong. REI is a cool place and the people who work there are always friendly and helpful. Their return policy is liberal, but then again, that’s how they are able to stock their quarterly garage sales. Was there some good deals to be had? Sure. However as already indicated, the best chances of a good deal go to those dedicated to showing up early. Maybe next time I will get there at eight?",,One man gathers what another man spills...sort of,"Feb 07, Sat",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482682,"I am back. My preparations were temporarily thrown back by an all hands on deck battle to score tickets for the Grateful Dead's 50 Year Anniversary celebration in Chicago July 3,4 and 5 of this year! Thankfully my hike is not until next year as this would have been a bummer to miss. As it stands I almost missed getting tickets and was rejected in the what will go down in history as the biggest blunder... the mail-order (where 90% of all fans requested tickets were denied). This in turn fanned the flames and put the event in the crosshairs of every scalper, carpet-bagger, scum-bag, opportunist, wanna-be deadhead and toolbox in the nation. Through sheer determination I mustered a small army of relatives and friends to man almost 25 computers last Saturday when the remaining tickets went on sale. At 10:00 am on Saturday February 28th 500,000 fingers touched the ""find tickets"" button on Ticketmaster's website (more people than who attended Woodstock).By 10:01 am it was over. Either your electronic impulse made it to Ticketmaster's server or it crashed along the way. There was not time for second tries. When the dust settled I was the proud owner of a pair of 3 day passes to the event. Every silver lining does have a touch of grey and my grey comes in the shade of backstage/no view tickets. I have never bought a pair of worse tickets and never have been so happy to get these tickets.

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/486472,"Well its last in the evening on April 2nd. If all goes to plan (which it seldom does) I will be on the AT in 365 days. Realizing I had missed my goal to have the bulk of my hiking gear purchased by April 1st of this year, I went over to REI tonight. Part of my tardiness in planning has to do with putting off my sleeping bag purchase until my dividend payment AND 20% off any one item made its way into my mailbox. Well it came a few days ago and I was unable to break away to REI until today. I headed over to purchase an Igneo Long sleeping bag. I have read enough to feel comfortable going with this bag. At $319 my 20% off any one item saved me approximately $70 bucks! Cool. The problem was the store was out of the Igneo Long bags. This is why we are planning and getting all this stuff now because I simply ordered it and it will be delivered to the house. I also bought a Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Compression Sack for the soon to be delivered bag. Barring any take backs... and I have to admit I am going to reconsider my Gregory pack for the highly touted Osprey Atmos... but without any exchanges I now have my big three and several other items that will be needed on my hike.Tonight I made the first journey into the clothing area. Despite being an outdoorsman, I will need to buy a lot of clothing items for this hike. Tonight I bought a pair of REI convertible pants (not sure if the length works I am testing them out as I type this) and I also bought a cool pair of Patagonia boxers. I think I am going to hike in Ex-Officios, but the selection in REI was weak for my size.And while it may seem that I have a long time between now and next April, I am anxious to further along my stuff gathering as I think a test run this summer and one next winter is going to be crucial.On a scale of 1 to 10 for preparation I am grading myself a 2 right now. I am no where near ready, but I guess I am further along at the end of today than I was yesterday.Hopefully in a few days I can stuff my new bag into my new compression sack and I think my all of my sleeping items will be done.",,One year count down...oh weeee!!!!,"Apr 03, Fri",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/500691,"My plans to attempt an AT thru hike in 2016 has always been real, but as of this Saturday the plan has taken on a new life of its own. I have approached the members of the National Wild Turkey Federation (NWTF) Texas State Board to support my journey. My goal is to raise awareness of the conservation group that I am proud to be part of as well as to raise money for the group. My idea was to do a ""pledge per mile walked"" campaign. I presented the idea to the Texas State Board on Saturday the 13th in Pottsboro, Texas. The trip to get from my farm in Barnum, Texas to Pottsboro, Tx was a journey in itself as the town sits on Lake Texoma right on the Texas/Oklahoma border. The group voted on my proposal and all in attendance unanimously agreed to support my fund raising idea as well as my hike. The goals is to raise at least $50,000 to be donated through the NWTF to Texas Parks and Wildlife to be used to support stockings of Eastern Wild Turkey in locations to be determined in East Texas. I have read that to make one's hike real, it has to be made public... well I guess you can say my attempt is now very public. On the long drive back to Barnum from North Texas I realized despite getting alot of my gear purchased and reading alot about what I should and what I should NOT carry, I realized I am still woefully unprepared in several areas including:Physical Preparation - I am no couch potato, but for whatever reason I hate to exercise. However, I am not going to subscribe to the ""you get in shape the first several weeks of hiking"" lie.Mental Preparation - I actually feel better prepared mentally than physically... and hey, I read Zach Davis' Appalachian Trials book... a must read in my opinion,Gear - I'm not sure here. I have a most of what I think I will need, but every time I read a review or a post on Whiteblazes something new pops up. I am liking this to hunting gear... I carried about seven different turkey calls in my vest this spring when I chased Rio Grande turkeys in Central Texas. And in the end I used only two to get the job done. I am going to have to learn to leave the excess ""baggage"" at home for my AT journey.Food and Resupply - I feel very weak in this area and I am beginning to focus on understanding what it will take to keep me from starving. As of right now, hunger is a major concern that I feel can lessen my chances for success.So the good news is my journey will also go to supporting a very good conservation cause. The even better news is I still have about 10 months to get very serious about the success of this journey.",,This is for real...,"Jun 15, Mon",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502011,"The title to this post is ""what I fear"" and I am not sure its the best title... because its not about fears as much as it is about concerns regarding the hurdles that I will have to overcome in order to pull off a successful thru hike in 2016. So I listed my current fears/concerns in this entry. I left off the fear of journey ending injury because that is... well obvious. So the six areas of fears/concerns (not in any particular ranked order) are:Sleeping pains: I have spent some nights in some uncomfortable places and tents have been involved in a fair share of those. But those uncomfortable nights in tents and other unsavory places are rare events in the new millennium. And when they did occur, it has never for an extended periods of time and usually there was some sort of ""liquid cushion"" involved.   I currently plan to start my journey with an REI Flash air mattress. I am not 100% sold on this beast and I recently looked at some wider and thicker (and heavier) specimen. I will wait until I get closer to the journey before I decide if the extra weight is doable. If so, I will upgrade and call it my ""luxury item"". Back pains: Friends have always said I have not backbone...which is a complete fallacy because it hurts, often. This is why I am taking this game of ounces so serious, but all what I am reading about 25 pound fully loaded backpacks...no way can I pull that off. Of course at 230 pounds I should be able to lug a few extra pounds, but not first without strengthening my core. Strengthening my core....just saying that makes me want to lie down on the couch ""for a while"".Blisters/Feet Issues: In April this year I walked a lot while turkey hunting and in Central Texas and to show for my two day jaunt I brought home a turkey and one major blister. If blisters were classified on a 1 - 10 scale (why not every thing else is?) this one might have garnished a 9.   Granted, I was wearing cheapo sox, but still one more day afield may have been ugly. The book ""Taking Care of Your Feet"" is on my ""to read"" list this summer. And hey, I already have my REI sox ready to go.Hunger: This might be the biggee. I recently started researching some of the deluxe meals to enjoy on the trail and... well tacos, chips and salsa did not make the short list. I can handle eating marginal stuff, but can I get enough? In my years of experience, anything crummy is made crummier by the feeling of hunger.Idle Time: All my life its been one activity on to the next without slacking time. Sure I waste time, but not just slacking off. I don't want to be a robot on the trail and never ""screw off"", but at the same time playing solitaire at a shelter for three days while I wait for something to heel or feel better scares me. Can I hump a book?Cold: And this one almost did not make it the fears list. I have now invested in enough quality hiking gear that I feel confident that I won't be taking out by being too cold or too wet or any combo of such. Not to mention, I have been out in the elements a lot hunting. Recently. I think it comes down to starting with enough stuff to stay warm at night in April and May. So that's it right now. I will be interesting to see how these fears and concerns change between now and April and even more exciting to look back and see what which ones were the real issues and which ones were not. I am sure there are some I am missing so the list may change as I continue my preparations.",,What I fear....,"Jun 23, Tue",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505124,"My hike is approximately 37 weeks away. I know this because I met with a personal trainer on Friday and discussed a routine that I can do to better prepare myself for the hike. I recently have been given the nod by the National Wild Turkey Federation (NWTF) to support my fundraiser idea and do a ""march of dimes"" money raising campaign while I hike. All proceeds will be donated to the NWTF who in turn will donate the money to Texas Parks and Wildlife (TP&W) who will match the funds FOUR TO ONE. Yes... for every dollar I raise TP&W will match four. What this means is I will have a lot of people watching me as the money raised will go directly to the re-establishment of the Eastern Wild Turkey in East Texas. Up until the NWTF said yes...this hike was really about myself. It adds some pressure and it forced me to look hard at the areas I feel unprepared and I am addressing those now. The two areas that I will address with my personal trainer (aka Sargent Slaughter) will be my complete lack of the desire to work out. Whatever wire that fires in the brains of those people who like to get out and run or lift weights is evidently not connected in my brain. That being side I am not a complete couch potato. In fact I slugged through an entire two days up in my farm in East Texas this weekend. I strapped on Vasque Breeze's and my REI light hiking sox to give them a test run. It was hot. Like real hot.... the high was 95 degrees with high humidity. My feet felt good all day. It was the rest of me that hurt and about 4:40 (heat of the day) I had to seek shelter in my hammock. I would say all told, I put in several miles with my new shoes in some extreme heat and my feet felt good. The heat might have felt a little hotter this weekend since the last two weekends I was in much cooler places... Santa Clara, CA and Chicago, Illinois. I attended the Grateful Dead's Fare Thee Well shoes in both cities and even touch on some 50 degree (or there abouts) temps at night in Santa Clara... 50 degrees, really? We wont see 50 degrees here in Texas until October. Anyway, I Santa Clara I wore an AT shirt and was approached by a guy who called me out in the nicest way I have ever been called out. Evidently wearing an AT shirt represented (to him anyway) that I actually did the hike. He suggested in the a kind and encouraging way that I turn the shirt inside out and not wear it turned right side out until I am done. For whatever reason this seemed to make sense and I turned it inside out right there in the middle of the second Santa Clara show. There is a line from a song that suggests one's life can be changed from a talk with a stranger and its true. He slapped me on the back and said this will motivate you and I know your will do it. I intend to call on the strangers words when I have those moments of doubts that I know I will have.",,Stepping Up,"Jul 13, Mon",0

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/506153,"My original start date was April 1.... The exact date of the 1st was arbitrary from the beginning and I suspected it would change. This past week I did some research (white blazes as well as AT site) on the reality of the large number op hikes starting in March and April in Springer. I guess I was sucked into a thread about the movie ""Walk in the Woods"" coming out this Fall and the fear (whether real or not) of an army of movie goers splitting from the cinema and running straight to REI to buy gear for their attempt. I don't doubt for s moment the AT will be more crowded in 2016... Movie or not, so I did some research on AT site. Here is what I found. Of the total starts in 2015 the lion's share were actually in March with a fairly decent bell curve in the last two weeks of March. Because the graph is by day, I was able to tell that no doubt the weekends are big days... Kind of odd since if you are going to thru hike the next 5 to 6 months are weekends sort of. It could have to do with getting rides to Springer (friends and family are available on weekends?) Who knows?I am not all that worried about crowds, in fact I want to start in the bubble and meet people. However, starting on a day when 50 plus people are starting seems a bit too much. So Friday, Saturday and Sunday's are out. That kills April 1st (Friday). I am also not thrilled about being real cold (although I can handle it and I am well prepared), I just want to avoid as much crappy low temps as possible. So starting on a weekday in late March is not out of the question, but not optimal. Right now I am considering starting midweek after what will be the busiest start weekend April 2nd and 3rd. That would be say Tuesday the 5th or Weds the 6th. There are many advantages to this including getting to turkey hunt here in Texas before shoving off to Atlanta in the 4th. I have months to make my decision final. But right now my start dates are either March 30, 31 or April 5,6. I am definitely excited about starting in the bubble and meeting people and as equally excited about making my start without being in the belly of the beast.",,Start date pintification and conundrum,"Jul 19, Sun",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508705,"I am actually keeping up with the getting in shape schedule that has been laid out in front of. Tonight was a simple 40 minutes of cardio. I decided to cheat a little and do a somewhat fast pace walk with my pack loaded down at 30lbs. Technically, Saturday was supposed to be the first 30lb. walk, but I missed it. So tonight I had to increase my pack from 20lbs. to a back breaking 30lbs. I did this by taking out most of my base weight items (I see no reason to carry this around and put unnecessary wear on it). I replaced the base weight items with beach towels and three small barbell wights that weighed 2.5 pounds each. In addition to the weights, I also am using water bottles as ballast.So when I headed out at 7:00 o'clock my pack was officially at 30lbs. The weather was perfect for a bit of a butt kicker. It rained hard for 45 minutes at about 3 today (first rain here in over a month). The searing heat was replaced with a slightly cooler temperature (if you could call low 90s cooler) along with some of that lovely Houston humidity we are known for. I would guess it was about 90 degrees?I hit the White Oak Bayou trails in front of the Heights. I like walking down on the bayou as there are some slight bumps (not hills) but bumps that gives me a little feel for inclines. I also try to walk on anything but concrete to get my feet ready for uneven walking. I am convinced that it will be very difficult to get the right amount of actual incline hill training here in Houston. One has to work with what one has.I am training with my Vasque Breeze. These seem to fit the style of hiking shoe that I plan to take 2,180 miles. I like the upper support. So far they feel good on my feet. My left shoe seems to have just a little more room than my right shoe. I doubt that I am the only hiker who has ever encountered this. I think I even heard that everyones' two feet are slightly different? So I am not 100% sure on the Breezes yet. If I pull the trigger and go with these I will buy another pair and begin alternating usage in my pre-hike training. That way I will have two pairs of semi-broken in shoes ready to go and not one really broken in pair. Hopefully when it comes time to replace the pair I start with, I can coordinate with a care package coming from the AT coordination headquarters and extra gear warehouse (my living room here in Houston). I am also going to find some extra pairs of shoe laces to have on stand-by. Tonight I even hit some back trails in the park down by the bayou. These trails lead off into the woods where I am sure a bevy of after dark atrocities occur. Because of the afternoon rains they were slightly muddy. Again, it was good to walk on something other than the concrete bike path.People ask me if I feel odd carrying around a backpack at the park. Trust me, the people down there are too busy doing their part in trying to keep Houston out of the title of ""the Fattest City in the USA"" once again to notice a dude with a 30lb. backpack. And besides, I looked not stranger than the dude wearing a black hoodie...with the hoodie up! I am sure sooner or later some do-gooder will call the PD convinced that I have a backpack full of stolen loot, but I will deal with that when that happens.I still have not zeroed in on my start date, but it is more than likely in late March on a weekday. I may have started the death marches a bit early, but hey, I might even lose a few pre-hike pounds and contribute to keeping Houston from the list again. At the end of the 40 minutes my shoulders felt the extra 10lbs. but it was not where near ""race for the Ibuprofen"" bad. Because of the limitations in the terrain here in H Town, I plan to get comfortable with up to a 45lb. pack on these walks. I would like to be at 30lbs. when I start in Springer, but I suspect I may be a few pounds over that.",,My Tuesday night workout,"Aug 04, Tue",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/510881,"Entries have been few and far between, its tough to update a journal with ""hiked by the bayou again today"", and that has been the bulk of my AT focus here in July and August. And rightly so, I think nightly getting in shape activities will carry me further than reading 2015 hiker's journals and agonizing over the various styles of hyper-light titanium sporks? Well, okay maybe exercising and spending some time finalizing my gear selection will get me to Maine.Last night I weighed just about everything I have on the short list for my hike. I do not have all items in a neat pile as some items are going to be used in everyday life up until I leave as well as in hunting season this year. I plan on weighing those this week so I can tally up an existing total. I used a regular digital kitchen scale and entered the results in an Excel database that I created specifically for my hike.I felt good about some items and not so good about others Overall my base weight is 17.7 lbs HOWEVER there still are several items that must be weighed and added to the total. The good news is the remaining several items are all on the lighter side (the 17.7 lbs includes the bulk of my items including backpack, sleeping bag, pad, stove, tent, etc.) The bad news is that I can not see myself meeting that coveted 30.0 lbs (full load). Based on whats left to be weighed, I anticipate at least 33.0 lbs and maybe even as high as 35.0 lbs (gasp!!!) At this moment I am using a standard guess for food and water based on an even 10.0 lbs.I plan on working on this over the next several months leading up to April. I have the time. I am confident that there are ways to lighten the load. As example, there has been a great debate on the necessity of a ground cloth under a tent. When I purchased my Henry Shire's Tarp Tent (Double Rainbow) I also purchased the Tyvek ground sheet and intended to use it.... why not, it weighs almost nothing right? Wrong. I discovered EVERYTHING weighs something and EVERYTHING weighs more than what one thinks it weighs. The Tyvek ground sheet came in at 7.3 ounces. That's too much! I am either scuttling it in total or cutting it in half and using it under the part of my tent that will be most vulnerable.Other surprises were my very light and very basic camp sandals ($1.99 at Academy). Score! I think these are a must to have after hiking 8 to 15 miles a day. However, they weighed in at a whopping 9.5 ounces. Having $1.99 invested I figured I will keep them and maybe keep an eye out for a lighter pair, but I am packing something to wear at camp. And what about that Seas to Summit Reactor sleeping bag liner coming in at a hefty 14.1 ounces? That was perhaps the greatest wow! I can now see where this gear weighing thing becomes obsessive.",,Getting in shape and weighing gear,"Aug 20, Thu",0

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512415,"My wife had week to week business in the Bay Area so I flew out and we spent a few days in Yosemite. The goal was to do some day hiking and hopefully some flyfishing. I did not want to make this a shakedown hike because time would not permit for any real overnight stays.   So on Saturday we hiked up to Nevada Falls which, based on where we parked our car, the round trip ended up being approximately 10 miles. The elevation change from the beginning to the top of the falls is approximately 2,000 feet. Despite working out for two months this summer the steepness of the climb plus the fact we were at about 5,000 feet to start kicked my ass. Going from Houston Texas to Yosemite in 12 hours leaves little time to adjust for thinner air ... Or at least that's what I told myself. Thankfully Springer is only about 3,800 feet so I won't have the sea level blues in the beginning of my hike.  I did not carry full 30 pounds it was probably closer to 20 I did stuff a bunch of extra items in my pack to give myself some weight including a bunch of flyfishing stuff. The water was very low in the park California is definitely not bluffing when they talk about their drought. Despite that I was able to snag a few trout on both nymphs and dry flies during my hikes. It was not easy fishing.The hike on Saturday and the easier hike on Sunday did remind me that being in shape for April is crucial.   And let me tell you the park was crowded where we started our hike up to Nevada Falls it did thin out but man there were a lot of people walking up the trail I hope the AT is no where's near that much of a circus. I spoke to a ranger at the place where you would get overnight or wilderness area permits as they called them . The subject turned to the recent interest in the Pacific Crest Trail as well as the John Muir trail. He was definitely up on the challenges in Baxter State Park regarding through hikers and he definitely had his opinion formed.   I enjoyed the conversation although we definitely did not think on the same side of the brain . I took away from the conversation that this particular Ranger would be just as happy if no human beings were allowed to walk in wilderness areas. He also seemed pretty upset about the amount of ""partying"" that goes on on the PCT and JMT. And God for bid if somebody should step on a butterfly or break a flower. But then again as we drive back towards the Bay Area and through the Modesto area I realized what a Pretty place Yosemite was and it shouldn't be a place left for a bunch of idiots to destroy. That being said it really doesn't do anybody good if no one's allowed to use it either. Final thought on that 95% of Yosemite is considered a wilderness area there's only 5% that is ""developed"" that's a hell of a lot of wilderness. So the hikes were good but I need to do a shakedown hike I'm thinking Big Bend national Park here in Texas sometimes this fall I started researching and it looks pretty amazing more on that later.",,View Entry,"Sep 02, Wed",0

Actually October 1 is the longest I think it will take me and really hope to have the hike done in mid September next year. Preparations continue although I have backed off on my exercise routine in September. My immediate plan is to continue getting in shape however I know that the last three months before my start is when I will intensify the workouts. I have been going over my gear list and have been making changes currently I'm reevaluating my sleeping pad situation. I'm also in the process of figuring out when I am going to do a shakedown hike. I did not do one this summer however I really wanted to do one in cooler weather to reflect what I would be faced with when I start at Springer in April. Right now I'm thinking Big Bend National Park later this year or early 2016.In addition to making changes to gear I have also started to build a list of action items that I have to accomplish prior to leaving. That list may be more extensive then the hike itself but I cannot just walk out and let everything in my life just come to an end.

Whether I harvest or I borrow somebody else's venison I'm going to prepare a bunch of venison jerky to be part of my boxes that my wife will send along the hike. I don't really expect to do a ton of mail drops it's going to be more like an occasional care package?  I had a couple kind people post some very kind words to my guestbook, thank you! It's cool knowing that people are reading the entries . As we get closer to the hike and obviously during the hike my entries will be much more frequent. My knee is feeling better although I am up here hunting I am not walking a bunch it's mostly sitting in a Deerstand which is just about perfect for my knee. Hopefully it's just something weird and not something that's going to be part of my hike. I have never had issues with my ankles knees hips or anything else .One guest book entry suggested Lone Star Trail here in East Texas for a shakedown hike that may be something I consider this winter or I may go to Big Bend but I am starting to think about a shakedown hike.

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517141,"A month or so ago I went deep into my kitchen set up and decided to trade in what I had thought was an obvious choice, a JetBoil system, for some cool Snow Peak titanium items. I bought the Snowpeak Lite Max and a 700 Trek Pot. I like several features including the set's weight as well as the way a can of fuel nests in the pot. So with the big swap I decided to give the new system a whirl this past Sunday. The timing was perfect.... I was in between morning and evening deer hunts up at my place and I was hungry. I had been expecting to do this test the last few weekends, but rain has gotten in my way. I wanted to do the test as if I was on the trail so I selected a Knorr meal (Fettucini Herb I believe it was) and a can of white chicken meat. Now I do not expect to lug cans of anything with me, so this was a slight deviation from a live test... However I did open her up with an MP38 can opener. I carry one of these jewels on a cord around my neck. The MP38 is a U.S. military can opener that was issued by the millions back when C Rations came in cans. They work so well opening a can with one is actually fun. But back to the test....I fired up the Lite Max. It was a little breezy out Sunday. I made an immediate mental note to think wind screen. The breeze did effect the flame and it did seem to take a little longer than expected to boil my water...which I eye-balled as a cup and did not cheat with a measuring cup therefore making up for using a can and not a pouch of chicken.I then added the Knorr and let it do its thing for a few minutes. As I waited I went to my summer kitchen refrigerator for a beer (yet another deviation to the test) and while I was in there found a half a stick of butter. Somehow a bit if the butter ended up in the pot along with the chicken and the Knorr. The result was a creamy Chicken Fettucini Special, which actually tasted good and was fairly filling. I liked to Snow Peak Lite Max and Trek Pot, however I was s little concerned about the final weight of the fuel canister. It seemed light as in I used a lot of gas to boil one cup of water. Because the meal was good and I am going back this weekend, I will try again just to see how far I can go on one can of fuel.So far I do not have the raw materials needed for my venison jerky. I have watched lots of deer on my place this last weekend. I was just waiting for that right one. I believe I will take care of business one way or another this coming weekend.",,Cooking setup,"Nov 09, Mon",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517829,"Now that I have my venison jerky raw materials I can get back to updating my journal. In between hunting and work I have recently gone on a gear shuffling binge upon trying out items I bought early on in the planning as well as some Information uncovered on the Internet.Perhaps the biggest realization was a question I asked on Whiteblazes.net about gloves and an April start. Unanimous the replies were, CARRY GLOVES! Although there were varying degrees of the decree, I took the hint and have since purchases gloves by Manzella. They are basically liners and weigh no more than 2 ounces. Not sure if this is my final choice, but I will carry some type of gloves.The whole glove thing made me consider some of the extreme temperatures that I will encounter early on. Hey, I live in Houston where we call anything lower than 45 extreme! The reality is there will be cold nights and some cold days. I have been told expect lows as far as mid 20's? For whatever reason this hunting season has been rainy here in Texas. The reality is cold is one thing, but wet and cold is another. That being the case I am returning my XXL Marmot Precip and going to a XXXL. The XXL just felt too restrictive and I never felt settled with it since I bought it.I feel I am good pretty well covered for hiking in colder temps and I believe I have the sleeping arrangements dialed in as well. But I am sure I will continue to make changes.To get my sleeping arrangements finalized, I recently exchanged my REI Flash sleeping pad for a Sea to Summitt Comfort Light pad. The exchange cost me about 4 additional ounces but the increase in comfort seems 5X.Over the Thanksgiving weekend I set my Double Rainbow TarpTent up so that I could finally seal the seams. The tent comes with a bottle of sealant that is clearly marked ""Use as Soon As Possible"" which having bought the tent 6 months ago I didn't. But being that I had the tent up, the foam brush in hand and rain on the horizon, I went for it.I did a neat job with the sealant and felt good that I covered all relevant seams. I left the tent up for the next two days as a test. And man did we have rain!! After two days and nights of on and off deluges I was surprised at how dry the inside was (keeping in mind I was NOT actually sleeping in it). I did notice a few tiny ""puddles"" of water. That has me concerned, but then again... It rained relentlessly.When I went to take down the tent I noticed the sealant still felt ever so slightly sticky. I am hoping this is a delay in drying due to humidity and not because I used 6 month old sealant. I plan to call TarpTent to get the official verdict.One thing else that happened was the realization that a wet tent (wet on the outside) does not dry easily. I took down the tent and tried to shake off as much water as possible. It's clear that a wet tent morning (which I am sure there are many) will be a pain and no doubt shaking out and drying a tent is an art form. Based on the rain and humidity in my parts this weekend, there was no chance in hell that tent was drying. So I am thinking and rethinking every possible way to stay dry and warm.",,"Gonna be cold, cold, cold.....","Nov 30, Mon",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518192,"December 7th seems to be a good day to register with the ATC, and that is what I just did. So it is official, not that it was not official before.I am officially in pre-hike mode, which involves trying to square away as much as possible before April. I have a lot of projects up at my land to complete including an immediate salvage logging operation of a handful of acres that were roasted hard by the fire in October. I am busy to say the least. I was up at my land this weekend and enjoyed the last hour and a half of light in a deer stand Saturday evening in a spot that I have not hunted before. You know it is winter in Texas when it gets cold as soon as the sun dips. This fall has been very mild here and it was basically my first exposure to being cold this year. And it was not even that cold, but it went from mild to cold quickly and I started rethinking my hiking cold weather clothing. Originally I planned to use a pair of long johns from my pile I already own. I am rethinking this now. I tried on a pair of Smart Wool base layers on at REI the other night. These bad boys would definatley keep me warm, I just don't know if I can handle the wool touching my skin. Additionally, I am afraid they might be too warm in the day in April when hiking. Dry/cold temperatures when active are very tolerable.If anyone reading this entry has any thoughts, I would be happy to hear them. My intention is to be comfortable at say 35 degrees. Stepping out side on Saturday night when temps were in the low 40s I can not say what I have today is going to cut it. For cold weather I have a Patagonia Puff Hoodie and a Micro Fleece pullover that I bought years ago from LL Bean. The pullover has stood the test of time in deer hunting temps above say 45. Its the one piece of my hunting gear arsenal that will make the trip. Its camouflage and my wife is claiming that I will alienate the granolas by wearing it. That's not the intention, I like granolas. In addition to the Puff Hoodie and the fleece pullover I will have a Marmot Precip rain jacket and that's it other than the base layers, pants and shirt (other than gloves and beanie).I am strongly considering pulling the trigger on the Smart Wool and also carrying a lighter pair of base layer bottoms. Again, its not the daytime temperatures that scare me as much as the night-time and I don't want the only answer to the cold to be to climb into my sleeping bag. On the other hand, I definately don't want to hump unneeded warm clothing. These are they kinds of decisions that make this so exciting. I really don't know all the answers and the thrill of discovery is what fuels my desire.",,Reality and base layers,"Dec 07, Mon",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518257,"So I had several great emails regarding my tent seam and base layer pontifications, enough to suggest that 1) I am not the only one who has ever invested hours agonizing over tent seams and base layers and 2) people actually read my cyber-dribble. So as I wait for the United States Postal Service to deliver my latest batch (Smart Wool base layers (top and bottoms) from REI) I sit will here and put another one up for you.As a side note, I am not a fan of REI’s, “higher than a Phish Phan” prices. And let’s face it folks, the year-end dividend is basically a tossed up bone that puts you just close to break-even. The catch is, both the ringleaders of Recreational Equipment, Inc. and you know that you will plow that dividend check right back into their coffers (and probably for something dumb that you already have two of). Damn they are smart.   However, and this is a big however…. the ease of changing one’s mind is simplified by the fact that they just don’t ask. And man has my mind changed throughout this process. Hell, I probably owe them a dividend. Come hell or high water, I am starting on April 6th. And since neither hell nor high water will greet me a Springer, this trip is on! So, what to hump for the cold temperatures of April and May in the Appalachian Mountains? The following is what is on my clothing list as of today. Like my very next REI purchase, my decisions are subject for further review, manipulations, substitutions and analysis.   Here we go from head to toe:Sun-visor. What, baseball hates make you look like a redneck, but like to keep the sun out of your eyes? Then like me, the visor is for you. As an added bonus mine says NWTF (National Wild Turkey Federation) and since my hike is going to help raise some loot for the turkeys, it multi-purposeful!Beanie. I think this might make the round trip. My acrylic/polysester String Cheese Incident beanie. Its warm, its light and it will help win the granolas back if they see me wearing my camouflaged LL Bean fleece pullover.Ultra-Light Balaclava. I don’t see many people listing these, but for less than 2 ounces this gem can serve as a neck gaiter, hood or even come in handy if I have to rob a bank or storm a crack house along the way.Patagonia Nano Puff Hoodie. Aka, “the big gun”. For what it’s worth, I skeptical on just how warm this puffy is.LL Bean Micro Fleece Pullover. My only article of clothing from the hunting pile, and that’s a big pile. As I already mentioned, its camouflaged and by wearing it I violate myself imposed “no camouflage unless you are actively hunting” rule. I will be glad to tell you why such a rule exists if you really have to know.   REI Polyester Long Sleeved Shirt. This will be my go to hiking shirt. Under Armor Long Sleeved Shirt made out of whatever Under Armor is made out of. This will be my camp shirt. I am up in the air about carrying two long sleeved shirts. Anyone, anyone?Light Weight Polyester Long Johns. Okay, maybe there are TWO items from the hunting pile that will make the cut. I am not sure of the brand on these, but they are light-weight warm and make my legs look hot when worn with shorts. Midweight Smart Wool Top.Midweight Smart Wool Bottoms. But wait a minute…the Smart Wool really has to pass the skin test. Wasn’t it Merino Wool that helped me decide I hated wearing suits early on in my career?   The jury is out, but as I said, these bad boys are in route from REI and if they fail, back they go…no questions asked. I had one responder say that these will be too heavy starting in April. So I am still uncertain and may go with something a little less severe. As a side note, I love how people claim wool smells less. That’s not really a concern based on what I have been told….I will stink.Gloves – Lightweight Liners by Manzella. They are called Ultra Max so they gotta be good. Nuff said.Two Pairs of Exoffico Underwear.   My test pair seems to ride up a tad on my back and if they are not careful they will be tossed in the drawer like a bad Christmas sweater and my standard Under Armor brand will make the hike.Three Pairs of REI Wood Sox. I plan to carry three pairs of sox. Two for hiking and one for camp. The camp pair will be the heavy style and the hiking will be the light. I know, I know, everyone hiking the AT loves Darn Tough Sox. In fact, the AT hikers’ love affair with Darn Tough may be the ONLY THING that is universal and agreeable by all. On my “list to-do” is to migrate over to the sock section the next visit to REI and ponder Darn Tough. Boy, wait until I show up with a bunch of used REI sox to return. On a serious note, when so much good things are said about a product one has to listen. Here is to you Darn Tough!Two Pair of REI Silk Liner Sox. And they came in white so they won’t look grungy!Kuhl Liberator Convertible Pants. I have invested the better part of a 2015 into thinking and rethinking convertible pants and hiking pants in general. A lot can be said about the El Camino of the hiking pant…not all of it good. Is it a truck or is it a car, who knows? Facts are most of them make you look like your wife finally won the “how dumb can I dress my husband when we go to Europe this summer” contest. Shit, it’s a wonder they don’t all come with a matching fanny pack. But not Kuhls, because they are, well, cool. Let’s see how these work. They seem a little more suitable for spring as opposed to the wafer thin Exofficio’s I bought at Whole Earth Provisions (a place I go whenever I want to feel good about REI’s prices).Marmot Precip Rain Jacket. I went with XXXL. The XXL seemed tight and since this is my emergency “damn is it cold” shell, it better be able to fit over the Puff Hoodie.Marmot Precip Rain Pants. Whereas the Darn Tough Sox plan is agreeable by all, the rain pant debate certainly has its two camps. I will bet anyone a Knorr that mine are sent back home before June. Let it rain, rain rain!!!! Serious, in an April or May rain storm, I will be glad that I have them.Finally, and don’t try to talk me out of it, are a very light pair of Under Armor shorts. I think they are sold as running shorts. I don’t care what the folks at Under Armor wanted them to be used for, I love these things for hiking, camping and just relaxing. They weigh in at about 6 ounces and I can see these as my go to pants on nice days or when summer’s here and the time is right for dancing in the streets.So that’s my clothing as of today. I have heard several people say you should be able to wear everything all at once. I would say I can come close, although it sure would suck wearing five pairs of sox. Aside from the sox, I could pull it off, so I am confident I am on the right track. Thanks for your input.",,View Entry,"Dec 09, Wed",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518503,"With ""Winter"" weather finally hitting Texas, I am able to experiment with my layers. I had many good conversations with people over the last week or so about clothing and weather for an early April start. I believe I am getting it all dialed in.Last Sunday was dreary and rainy in Houston, so I decided to try my new Merino Wool base layers out (fresh out of the REI box). By the time I got to the park to do a quick 3 miles, the rain stopped (it rained all night and parts of the trails were flooded (see my picture)).The temperature was 50 or so. It looked a lot colder than it was. Once I started walking it was clear that the base layers were to much for 50 degrees and active. Had I been in the woods or on a trail I would have ditched them, but since I was in eye-sight of downtown Houston, I left my pants on. The conclusion, at 50 degrees or maybe less, I would be in shorts. Despite being too warm, the Merino Wool top felt great. The legs were a bit itchy, but they were toasty! The last few days I have been at my farm. I am watching over the logging crew that is cutting some of my timber that burned in October. The last two days have been very cold in the morning. Finally I am stepping out in the 30's! It's 37 degrees now (I think that is the coldest this Fall!) I was out earlier testing the Merino Wool and fleece layers. I felt comfortable, but I was doing some moving around in the barn. The beanie is warm and at 37 degrees some type of gloves are required (I was wearing work gloves).Yesterday I wore my Kuhl convertible pants and broke them in after walking through the charred clear cut. So now I will look salty and like a veteran of 1,000 campfires!!! Tonight I was not wearing the Kuhl's. I was wearing my Filson wax cotton bibs. These pants are amazing. I am tempted to hike in them but my fragile ego could not handle the scoffs from the ""Patagonia Cool Crowd"". I am not really considering these, but damn are they good bibs!For early April night-time temperatures that I am expecting, my clothing is not overkill. I have no doubt some of my items will be sent home, but I am confident I won't freeze in April.All of this will be tested on my shakedown hike on the Lone Star Trail coming up very soon. Hopefully I will pick a series of days when it is cold like tonight.",,View Entry,"Dec 18, Fri",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518788,"After words of loving encouragement from my family on Xmas eve (most of what consisted of predictions of wear I would crap out), I thought a Xmas morning hike along the Bayou would clear my head. The temps were in the low 80's... Yes you read that right, the low 80's. I tried my Kuhl convertibles out and they worked well going from long pants to shirts pants. Later that day I gave a ""what will be in my pack"" demonstration to my family. Here again, predictions of the Peach State kicking my ass persisted. I would not expect anything less. To throw them all off kilter and possibly to impress them a bit, I set up my TarpTent with my hiking poles. Thankfully this is relatively easy and I pulled off the demonstration. They agreed that I might even make it to North Carolina. The subject of the AT permeated Xmas and it jolted me into reality. When I hiked Xmas morning I did so with a full pack of what I would be actually carrying. The old towels and weights used this summer have been scuttled... I need to start tweaking not what I will be carrying, but how I will be carrying it. I don't want to carry three pounds of stuff sacks, but at the same time I don't like loose stuff in my pack. Let's call this my latest challenge.My sister shared with me a picture of my mom. The description on the back of the picture says ""Harper's Ferry 1997"" and shows her at an AT sign in evidently Harper's Ferry. It's funny in that I do not recall when she went there and I doubt I would have mentioned to her my desire to do the AT way back then (who knows maybe I did?). Any how, I thought it was cool. My mom is not around to offer words of encouragement anymore so the picture (see picture) will have to serve as such.",,Xmas Update,"Dec 27, Sun",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519053,"Happy New Years 2016!!! This will serve as my first post of 2016 and with just a few days more than three months from my start date.Over Christmas I had several family members read my entries, which created good conversations. In these conversations I realized I have not acknowledged the most critical piece to making my hike successful. I know you are thinking that I am about to yammer on about some light-weight piece of gear or my comfortable shoes, but you are incorrect.The one most critical element to my success or even my ability to take a shot at the AT is my wife Kelly. I am truly lucky to have an understanding wife who 100% supports my dream to do this and do it at this stage of my life (not waiting until ""retirement""). She has been supportive throughout my preparation stages so far and even has tolerated what might seem like obsessive pontifications over Merino Wool versus Capilene, etc, etc.Publicly announcing one's intention to do the AT draws all kinds of side bets from family and friends. Most of these side bets usually have me falling out short of North Carolina and at least one predicted Georgia as my terminus. But not Kelly, she knows I can do this and is strong enough to keep the home fires burning while I am away. Plus she already has said, if I tell everyone I am doing this I am NOT quitting until I am done or in the hospital!Thank you Kelly for the support!!!",,A very special shout out!,"Jan 04, Mon",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519240,"It’s January 6th, only three months until I strap on my big shoes and hop across the proverbial back fence. Preparations for my epic journey are in full swing, but let’s not allow that to get in the way of a good trailjournal entry. Embarking on something as meaningful as walking 2,180 miles or taking first place in a hot dog eating contest takes planning, lots of it. Don’t ask me to map out the secrets to the weenie championship, but let me share with you some thoughts on the hike. It’s not a secret, one better have a damn good reason for being “out there” when the romantic idea of peacefully being one with mother nature turns into the uncomfortable reality that she does not want you there, peaceful or not. Part of my planning has been to declare my intentions to anyone that seems to care. Understand that living in Houston, Texas and declaring that you intend to walk from Georgia to Maine on this path called “the Appalachian Trail” is different than say if you tell your chum that lives in Virginia or Vermont. For most Texans, anything east of New Orleans is New York City, which results in a limited perspective of the AT. Reactions may vary and are often contingent upon how close to the Alamo the reactor’s first day on earth was spent. There are those that can’t get past the WHY? I mean, if man was intended to walk outdoors for anything further than a daily round trip to the mailbox, Honda, Kawasaki and Suzuki would not have risen from the ashes and rubble of war ravished Japan to bring us the ATV? I have found that after I share my plan with folks belonging to this category, they often look at me in a different way the next time they see me.   Kinda like when you surprisingly bump into a friend “at the bar” and the next time you see him at the tackle shop he gives you that “damn were you drunk” look.There’s also those genuinely naïve people that are sincerely interested in the task at hand, but are absent of any true conceptual idea as to what an AT thru-hike entails. In “Texanese” these people are often referred to as “dip shits”. A conversation may go as follows:Me: Hey Dewey, I won’t be able to make your annual frog gigging shindig this coming summer.Dewey: Why not?Me: I am hiking from Georgia to Maine on the Appalachian TrailDewey: Damn that’s quite a haul, you got enough vacation, that’s going to take at least three weeks.These same people may ask you how are you going to carry six months of food and what is it going to be like not seeing anyone for weeks on end? They may even toss in a tip like, “hey man if a bear attacks you try to poke it in the eye.” Thanks.A sub-species of the ""dip shits"" are the sincere and generous folks that want to be part of your journey, but only by donating to the cause. I mean, they are not going to take a crack at the AT, but if they can hook you up with an old pair of sneakers or an uncle’s old tent from ‘Nam then in a round-about way they too have conquered the beast. Upon discovering this species, drop obvious hints that you have already gathered all your gear, unless of course the dude works in REI or is a river rafting guide.Next there are the perspective people. Do not under estimate the lengths these folks will go through to try to steer you off course and right back into accepting the thrills of car camping at the state park. These numbskulls’ efforts are only simplified by modern science in the form of Google. On a recent work trip to Las Vegas a friend of mine who calls the desert oasis home determined that hiking from Georgia to Maine was comparable in distance to hiking from Las Vegas to Panama City, Florida. For whatever reason that perspective, laid out like a losing hand of black jack, had me nearly folding. It’s not that I have anything against Florida and Vegas certainly has it’s moments, but there are some rough spots in-between. One of those rough spots is everything between say Henderson, Nevada and Lubbock, Texas. My perspective on that route is a one-way road-trip from Sin City to Houston that my wife and I endured a few years back. The intentions were to get the car we had in Vegas back home and get our kicks on Route 66. We got the car home. Short of Flagstaff, Arizona, there just isn’t much to see unless you like windmills, and I like windmills. But by God we did it and I have a coffee mug and a bumper sticker from Winslow, Arizona to prove it. Here’s a tip, if you plan to make this trip, fly. If you told me I had to walk this route I would hurl myself off the Hoover Dam. Nevertheless, don’t let the perspective people get in your head.Finally, and everybody has one of these, is the asshole buddy who will treat your revelation as undoubtingly the dumbest idea short of the time you ate that Peyote at Burning Man. If you are seeking sincere acknowledgement and support, don’t look here, you’re not going to get it. These boobs come from all stages of your life and could be an old college roommate, a beer drinking buddy, high-school badminton coach, parole officer or even former cell-mate. You get the point, people who know the real you. My acquaintances within this group find it amusing to predict the precise day at which I will surrender to the challenge. Most of these predictions have me somewhere south of Tennessee when I wave the white flag. At least one friend placed her wager on my dreams being shattered before I deplaned in Atlanta. Really? Another friend discovering, that my older brother zeroed in on day 7, showed me the ultimate vote of confidence by saying, ""I will give you 12"". Bastards.   And regardless of what category any of your people sink into, for whatever reason they always want to discuss the toilet paper plan?   So that’s all folks.

That in itself is a miracle with all the post offices in out hood getting sold to highest bidder, but that's another story. With my AWOL's guide in my hot hands, it seems like my hike is that much closer. I had pre-ordered mine a few weeks ago and even scored a discount by doing so. It's been a waiting game since then. There are other choices for AT guides, but David Miller's (AWOL) effort seemed to win hands down on the ""Internet Opinion Pole. And let's face it, when people on chat forums all start agreeing on one particular choice, that's a sign that you too should make that choice.My decision was locked down last summer when I called the number on the web-site (theatguide.com) and David answered. That's another good sign, when the author, craftsman or brewmaster answer the call, you know you are into something good.For those that do not know, the guide is an informative ""map"" of the AT which serves as a hikers intelligence database. Want to know where to get a free shower in Troutville, VA? Well according to the AWOL guide that might be had at the Troutville Fire Station. Flipping through the book I made note of some interesting places that I should probabally steer clear of, but I know I won't. The Lazy Hiker Brewing Co. in Franklin, NC comes to mind.The guide is a paperback book and weighs in at 11.3 ounces (according to the website). I took the websites word for it and have not put it through the wright test yet.In regards of the weight, I plan to rip it into three sections. I can't see carrying s map that tells you Pat's Pizza in Andover, Maine is open 7 days a week if you don't make it past Jersey! I will have Kelly mail up the sections as I trek along. Hopefully she will be kind enough to drop some deer jerky in the box with the guide.I definately take my hat off to David Miller. Here is a dude that thru hiked back in 2003 or so and has carved out a living updating and producing guides for hikers since then.

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519949,"I am getting fired up for my short one night shakedown hike this Friday and into Saturday morning. I am heading to the Lone Star Trail, a 96 mile trail carved out of the East Texas woods not far from Houston. I spend ALOT of time up at our farm in East Texas so the scenery is not going to be new, but that's cool. The best part about it is the lows will be around 30° Yes I typed that correctly....it's going to be freezing in South Texas!   It is January after all and this cold weather crap is here to stay for at least a few more weeks. But pulling this shakedown hike off in cold weather was part of the scheme the entire time. I know I can survive in milder temperatures so a 45° low would have done me no good. The jury is still out on my lightweight cold weather kit, but hey if I'm going to freeze to death at 30° it might as well be in East Texas woods and not on some mountain in Georgia.I am going to be joined by Texas Bob, a dude that's taking his second crack at the AT this Spring. Hitting a shakedown with someone that has actually hiked a portion of the AT might have some benefits. His first attempt ended somewheres in North Carolina and he's going to be starting at that point right about the time I start on Springer. I have all my stuff laid out and it's pretty impressive to finally have everything all together.   Because we are doing a short hike I'm not going to be caring the full weight that I would normally be caring for food. Plus there's a few odds and ends that won't make the shakedown jaunt. I want my pack to be right at 30 pounds so I might have to add a few ballast weights. Right now I am thinking beer cans filled with beer! And maybe even a few ounces of whiskey. A few ounces of crown will serve as a perfect toast to my friend Texas Bob at the end of the evening and before I become fully encapsulated in my REI Igneo Long mummy bag.",,Shaking down shakedown street.... or trail,"Jan 20, Wed",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520119,"I just got back from my one-night shakedown hike on the Lone Star Trail with my shakedown compadre,Texas Bob. Man, what a good time, a great walk and an even greater experience in regards to getting a feel for some of my equipment and testing it through what ended up being a very cold night in the East Texas woods. But wait, there's more .... I also picked up a few little tidbits from Texas Bob as he is making his second shot at an AT thru-hike this spring and has done a lot of sectional hiking. With that experience he brought some practical first-hand knowledge to the ""Party in the Pines"".I wanted to make the hike as realistic as possible so I packed my entire kit with exception of just a few items. Because we were only going for one night I did not have to carry multiple meals so my pack wasn't quite 30 pounds. To rectify this topped off my pack with two cans of Coors light and some extra grub.We set up camp in a primitive campsite deep in the Sam Houston National Forest. The minute the sun dipped below the pine trees, the mercury started to drop. And quick. Going in I knew it was going to be a cold one but that was good because I was iffy on my extreme cold weather set up. By morning I found that I was in fairly decent shape as I got through the night being fairly comfortable despite the temperature getting to at least 28° forcing me to go ""full mummy"". Bob's evening didn't go as smoothly as he was trying out a new sleeping pad that evidently did not do what his old one did; Insulate him from the cold ground. On the other hand, I stayed warm despite pulling out the big guns and sleeping in just about every article of clothing I had in my kit. I know what you Northerners are thinking but hey man, 30 years of living down here in Texas with thin out anyone's blood! Eskimos included.Here are some other things I discovered....My Sea to Summit insulated sleeping pad kept sliding all over the floor of my Tarp Tent. I mentioned this to Bob and he suggested ""painting"" strips of seam sealer on the floor of my tent to serve as a grip. Problem solved.I like to use bandannas and I carried two red ones with me. I'm going to carry one red one and one blue one so I will know which one has been used to clean-out my cook pot and which one might serve as a ""do-rag"". I don't want to mix it up and have my hair smelling like Knor fettuccine pasta meal. I carried a absorbent Shamwow with me to serve as a camp towel and something to wipe away condensation.   That's right a real live Shamwow on the Appalachian Trail!! However I'm going to cut the one I have in half, it just does not need to be that big.Looking for shit in the dark sucks. I knew this going in. Onmy shakedown hike I refined my system as far as how to square things away in my pack and tent while in camp. I wasn't sure about my neck lanyard with my knife, lighter, micro-light, a military can opener and a few small clips for whatever I decide might be clippable to them. This however worked very very good and I'm definitely e going to be using it. Finally, and this is a big one, I have just recently bought a Flip-10 phone recharger. I decided to try it out in and charge my iPhone and guess what I discovered.... Yup, the cord connecting the charger to the phone was the wrong port. How bad would I have that sucked if I discovered that someone is in Georgia?Hiking out we passed many other hikers as the day was beautiful.

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520448,"Like a moth to an open flame, I was sucked into the world of YouTube AT videos this week. There are a lot of them and many are very informative. Within the last few weeks, several ""my 2016 thru-hiking gear overview"" videos have popped up like mushrooms after a spring rainstorm. That's not saying either of the two are bad, not at all. In fact, the gear overviews for whatever reason are very helpful and captivating, despite my kit being already lined out. I'm sure I am not the only 2016 hiker that is second guessing certain choices, and its perhaps a search for reassurances and a few tweaks that sucked me in. The reassurances come when you see some of the exact same items in your kit that were also chosen by the producer. I mean, if someone else is toting the Snow Peak 700ml titanium pot then the choice has got to be right for me as well. Right? Or the warm and cozy feeling you get when you bask in the glory of avoiding the journey-ending mistake made by the reviewer. Hey man, there is no way that trekker is going to make it, he is carrying a one pound iPhone charger. Good luck brother. Then there are the tweaks....oh those tweaks. After pouring through several of these videos, I have concluded that everyone on the AT in 2016 will be wearing Darn Tough Sox. Everyone. The epiphany occurred this week during my YouTube binge. Admiringly, I fought this hypothesis all summer long dismissing unabashed claims of superior foot wear on both White Blazes and within several journals I followed here. The stiff resistance was fortified by the fact that I already had invested in several pairs of REI's own answer to the Vermonter's stockings. And the reality is, the REI sox worked. But still. I secretly found myself hoping to hear someone say something shitty about Darn Tough. Anything. Please, somebody dislike these things, just a tad. Tell me the lifetime guarantee has some strings attached or the wool is harvested from endangered sheep. I have come too far to make such a major adjustment with just over two months left to launch time! But I am weak. I watched as review after review drifted into the footwear segment of their production. Oh please, don't say Darn Tough! But no, and it was almost like an after thought, like as if there was no other choice. And it seemed to be even the young kids were ready to shell out $20 bucks a pair for these hand forged stockings of steel. And for the youngsters, that's hard won money earned slaving over a fryolator or bilking it out of mom and dad, either way. And so I caved in. Off to REI I went. Friday, at lunch. As I schlupped past the backpack section heading for the check out with three pairs of Darn Toughs clutched securely in my mitts I thought.....I may be one of the only hiker on the AT without an Osprey Atmos this year, but when the evening shelter chatter turns to sox choice, mine will be Darn Tough.",,Darn Tough Sox!,"Jan 30, Sat",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520787,"Two months. Two months from tonight I will be camping somewhere near Hawk Mountain in Georgia having completed my first day on the AT. I am very fired up to say the least. This week was as close to a zero in terms of preparations as one could possibly get for getting ready for the hike. I was lucky enough to spend the most of the week in Puerto Rico with my wife Kelly at her company’s annual meeting. Yup, I was the spouse, which means while she was trapped in meeting all day with her counterparts, I hung-out and attempted to keep up with work emails and what not.  But in reality, I found myself screwing off and eventually found myself at the spa for one afternoon where I partook in a one hour rum-oil massage. Man, I was thinking something like this would be nice along the AT. After the massage I found myself at the beach resting my soon to be tired AT bones. Yes, life was tough.  Everything is progressing nicely on my preparations. Save for a few minor adjustments subsequent to my big sox switch (See last entry) I am basically done agonizing over ounces. Work is busy and I am behind after my Puerto Rico boondoggle, but I will get caught up this coming week.   With only two months to go time, I am going to be hustling pretty hard from here on out.  In Puerto Rico several of Kelly’s associates expressed interest in my quest. I shared with many my link and I welcome those that have checked in to see my journal.  Tomorrow night is the Houston Chapter of the National Wild Turley Federation’s dinner here in Houston. It is always great to attend the “Houston Dinner”. This year is especially exciting as the good folks of the Houston Chapter have welcomed me to solicit additional pledges for my cause.  As part of my AT attempt, I will be accepting pledges per the total miles I walk… and it damn well better be 2,180, but one never knows. The money that I raise will be matched by Texas Parks and Wildlife at a rate of $4 to $1 and all those dollars will be earmarked to support to Eastern Wild Turkey Restoration efforts here in East Texas. East Texas was once awash with Eastern Wild Turkeys and their populations were decimated when the land was cut-over one hundred years or so ago. Today, Eastern Turkeys are slowly returning to East Texas and I hope that the money I raise does some good for these magnificent birds.",,Two months and counting....,"Feb 05, Fri",0
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520832,"Last night the Houston Chapter of the National Wild Turkey Federation (NWTF) held its annual fundraising dinner here in Houston. The event was a success and early indicators suggest that the generous hunters/conservationists in attendance stepped up and contributed to a successful dinner. During the course of the evening I received several pledges for my AT walk, bringing the total pledged dollars to about $10,000!As indicated in my previous message, all pledged dollars raised will be donated by the NWTF to Texas Parks and Wildlife (TP&W). These dollars will be matched by TP&W on a $4 to $1 basis! The funds will go to restocking Eastern Wild Turkeys in East Texas with a goal to reestablish sustainable populations of the birds. The Eastern Wild Turkey is native to East Texas, but their populations were decimated in the late 1800s and early 1900s due to habit loss and over harvesting. A visitor to my blog recently questioned my intentions. While I do not intend to address everyone who posts negative comments, I will use this opportunity to clarify some points regarding my blog as well as my fundraiser.I have two goals attached to the fundraiser: 1) to create awareness for the conservation efforts laid forth by the volunteers of the NWTF in ALL states. The NWTF has been instrumental in reestablishing populations of wild turkeys throughout the United States since the groups inception in 1973. 2) raise dollars to support restocking efforts here in East Texas where historical attempts to reestablish Eastern Wild Turkeys have been met with mixed results. The AT travels through 14 states, all of which have reestablished populations of Eastern Turkeys. These states would give the nod to the NWTF in taking part in their own restablishments. Hopefully my hike will call awareness to the NWTF's efforts and victories. As an example of success, If you thru-hiked the AT in 1973 (the year the NWTF was founded) there was a good chance that you would not have spotted many wild turkeys. At that time the total number of wild turkeys in all of North America was only 1.5 million. Today populations are estimated at 7.0 million. Regarding my blog, I am taking my journey to thru-hike the AT very serious. I am ready for this challenge. However, I have not and will not lose the desire or ability to have fun along the way. My posts are at times light hearted (my attempt at wit). I am confident that some may not get it others may be aggravated. Let's not take any of this too serious folks and if you feel slighted in any way, my upfront apologies. I am a life long outdoorsman, hunter, fisher, trapper, land steward and conservationist. I won't apologize for being any of these things. If you have stumbled upon my blog and you are unsure about hunting, that's totally cool. Stick around and follow my hike regardless. At the end of the day we all desire sustained habitats, well balanced populations of wildlife and beautiful wild places to enjoy in whatever legal manner you prefer to enjoy them. Now back to planning.....I spent some time yesterday planning the few mail drops that I will do along the AT as well as some re-weighing of gear. I am keeping track of the gear I am starting with on a spreadsheet that I designed. Not including food or water I am at 21.5 lbs. I am scratching my head as to how to ditch a pound or so as I really would like to start with a base weight of 20.0 lbs and no more than 30.0 lbs with food and water. I could get my pack to 30.0 lbs by going real light with food at the start, but that would be no fun.That's about all for now...

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521164,"I just arrived home from Nashville, TN tonight. The National Wild Turkey Federation (NWTF) held its 40th Annual National Convention and Sports Show at the Gaylord Opryland Convention Center during the last few days. I attended the event to promote my fundraiser as well as to meet NWTF employees and volunteers from the 14 states I will be hiking through. I met a ton of great people and was surprised at how many people were sincerely interested and even knowledgable about thru-hiking the AT. Many people knew someone that had completed a thru-hike or hiked large sections. Several people I met actually live near the AT and so far I have NWTF contacts in North Carolina, Tennessse, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. I look forward to meeting as many people along the way that support the National Wild Turkey Federation and the organization's goals of habitat conservation and the preservation of our hunting heritage. I am especially thrilled about making a contact with Regional Director Shawn Jenkins of Franklin, NC! He mentioned joining me for some miles of hiking and wrapping up the day at the new brewery in town; The Lazy Hiker Brewing Co. I had previously noticed the brewery in AWOL's AT guide book and, in the interest of not falling into the rabbit hole, planned to steer clear of the place. But I am committed now and I should probabally plan a late start coming out of Franklin the next day as Shawn's beer reviews were positive. I also was introduced to Scott Hill, the New State Jersey State President of the NWTF. Scott graciously offered me his support when I make it into New Jersey.

My kit is weighing in a little heavier than I my 20 pound goal, but I figure spending time walking with a loaded pack will pay greater dividends versus agonizing over how to cut an ounce or two. I am sure I will come back around to the ounce pontifications, but for now I am done. Today I stopped by the hardware store and invested $1.39 in a foot of braided vinyl tube. I am going to use the tubing to help me inflate my Sea to Summit air mattress and pillow when I hit camp.The tube is 3/4 diameter and fits snugly into to inflation hole of the Sea to Summit mattress and pillow. I cut one piece about an inch and a half long. This piece will be used to enable me to huff breath into the mattress and pillow with greater ease.I also cut a piece about a half inch long. This piece will be used in conjunction with a garbage bag enabling me to inflate the mattress without exhaling a million breaths. The last thing I wanted to do was lug a piece of tubing around with me, but by doing so it should keep me from getting dizzy or passing out from lack of oxygen every night. It will probabally save me from smashing my oxygen starved brain on a jagged rock. I practiced my technique with the garbage bag. Using the garbage bag enables me to get the mattress fairly well inflated, but a few deep huffs are still required to finish it off. As I fine tune my kit and prepare for my hike, I am enjoying reading the journals of few folks that are already on the AT.

If anyone has any thoughts, words of wisdom, stern warnings, “I shit you not” advice, or if you just feel like sending me into panic mode, feel free to comment.   The reality is, I feel pretty confident, so I am fairly mellow about my pack and gear at this moment. I have broken my kit into six sub sections: backpack, sleeping, cooking, clothes, personal and electronics.Backpack – Total weight 3.9lbs1.        Gregory Z65 and rain cover – so it’s not an Osprey. Sleeping System – Total weight 6.7lbs1.        REI Igneo Long 20 degree bag – proven to keep my bones warm already once in mid-20 temps.2.        Sea to Summit inflatable pillow 3.        Tarp Tent Double Rainbow and stuff sack – sets up in a minute. 4.        Z Seat – At 2.5 ounces I figured my dry ass will appreciate it.5.        Tent Pole for tarp tent6.        Tent Stakes (6 plus bag)7.        Sea to Summit insulated large Comfort Light with bag – maybe a little heavy at 1.6lbs, but its comfty.8.        Sea to Summit roll top dry bag for sleeping bag and pillowCooking System – 1.2lbs1.        Toak’s Titanium Cup - with plastic top and hot lips2.        Sea to Summit Spork3.        Snow Peak 700L Titanium Pot and lid4.        Snow Peak LiteMax burner (how cool is this thing?)5.        Fuel – nests into pot6.        Snow Peak mesh bag and small BIC lighter7.        Sawyer Mini Squeeze8.        Dirty water Platypus 1L9.        Clean water Platypus 1LClothing – 6.9lbs1.        Patagonia Nano Puff Hoodie2.        Columbia Fleece Pullover3.        Light Balaclava4.        Beanie hat5.        Light ski gloves6.        Long john top – merino pool mid-weight7.        Long john bottom – cap – mid-weight (I felt the merino wool bottoms were too heavy?)8.        Silk top - Patagonia9.        Silk bottom – Patagonia10.        Marmot Precip – Jacket11.        Marmot Precip – Pants12.        REI Sahara long sleeved shirt13.        Black Under Armor running shorts14.        Two pairs Darn Tough sox (total of three pairs (one pair worn))15.        One pair silk liner sox (total of two pairs (one pair worn))16.        Under Armor compression underwear (total of two pairs (one pair worn))17.        Sea to Summit roll top dry bagPersonal – 2.2lbs1.        AWOLS guide (spiral bound ½)2.        Sham-Wow towel3.        Emergency space blanket4.        Small mirror for contacts - tiny5.        Saline for contacts6.        Cleaner for contacts7.        Camp flip-flops8.        Bear (mice) rope and bag9.        Soap – small vile10.        Small roll of duct tape11.        First aid (moleskin, Neosporin, tape, Aquaspore)12.        Ibuphrophen - I am sure I will be able to spell this by the end of this13.        Hand cleaner – about an ounce.14.        Fire starter – tiny little bit “just in case”15.        Glasses – reading and prescription16.        Toothbrush17.        Toothpaste18.        Floss19.        Gold BondElectronics - .8 lbs1.        Flip 10 charger2.        IPod with LOTS of music3.        Chargers and stuffAll of this weighs in at a hefty 21.7lbs. My goal was 20.0lbs and at this moment I do not see it. I would like to ditch the rain pants totally, but they will come in handy early on more so as an extra layer. They won’t last the entire trip, I promise you. Carrying silk top and bottoms may be a little redundant also, but if I am soaking wet they will be nice to sleep in. These will also be sent home as soon as I feel confident about the weather.Other points:•        Carrying bottles of saline, cleaner and a silly mirror sucks, but I am wearing contacts. I have dealt with this pain in the ass 100s of times hunting and I can navigate around the less than sterile conditions. My glasses are strictly back-up and I am also carrying an old pair of spare contact lenses. I have reduced the saline and cleaner bottles and they are light.•        I am carrying one ounce of Gold Bond and a tiny tube of Aquaspore. Let’s see how long that lasts.•        Don’t try to talk me out of the Toak’s Titanium cup, it’s a luxury. I am not walking from Georgia to Maine without a cup of coffee every morning. The quality of the swill is irrelevant, it’s the cup you drink it out of that counts. Plus this little caffeine delivery device weighs in at 2.3 ounces including an almond can plastic lid (that turns the cup into the holder for my coffee which then fits into the mesh bag along with my Snow Peak pot). If it actually nested would have really been cool, but ya can’t ask for it all.•        If it was not for the concern for mice I would ditch the rope or maybe retain a few feet to serve as a clothes line. This fear of bear thing is over rated and carrying a bunch of rope to hand food seems like overkill. At the end of the day I bet the rope gets scuttled before its all said and done.•        I am carrying a lot of weight in electronics. I do not count my IPhone as that is carried in my pocket. This may be a little bit like cheating, not sure? I am carrying an IPhone and an IPod. Crazy? Read on… I wanted to carry a very light Nano and use if for music only, but I could not pack all of my tunes on 16g (Nanos do not go any higher than 16g). I am packing jamband tunes and those never ending Phish jams take up a lot of memory so I had to concede into carrying my older IPod with a lot more memory that unfortunately weighs a few more ounces. However, carrying both devices enables me NOT to use my IPhone for music and enables me to get by with a Flip 10 phone charger as opposed to the heavier Flip 20. Let’s see how this works.Not listed in the 21.7 totals are those items that I anticipate wearing at any given point in time, which includes a short sleeved REI Sahara shirt, Kuehl convertible pants, another pair of Darn Toughs and liners, underwear. I also excluded poles and a few items carried in my pocket like chapstick and a very small Buck Hartsook knife.I have been following some hiker’s journals that have already started. Although it’s warm from where I sit at the moment, it sounds like winter is in full force in the Georgia Mountains. With only a month left to go, there is no doubt some of that winter will be hanging on when I arrive. This could be especially “shocking” to the system since it appears as if this Texas winter is DONE (high today was 85!). I was really kind of surprised to see my total packed clothes weighing in at 6.9lbs, but again, some of that extra weight is to hedge against the cold. Final thoughts, and I saw this on someone else’s journal and agreed totally, to those planning a 2017 hike, the last few months leading up to your start date happens in high gear. Planning how to put your life on hold and tweaking your gear makes January turn into March fast. Don’t wait until last minute to have your shit in order.   I am looking forward to this.

I'm so glad I have my kit in order because the list of personal things to do before I go is never ending. It would be a mind twister if I still was gathering gear and what not.I am not going to second-guess anything at this point that I will be carrying out of Springer. Despite what appears to be a very mild end to a less than harsh winter. I was up at our farm today there was a high of 88°! Spring has sprung here in full force.

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523740,"I am trying to keep my preparation posts to a minimum, but I just had to toss this one out at you. I'm not out of Houston yet and I am already experiencing trail magic. In fact I received three heavy doses of TM in the last 24 hours. I'll share them with you in no order of relevance:My buddy Keith has a group of hunters from Pennsylvania down to hunt wild hogs. Despite being slammed with last minute stuff to do, I went down to the deer lease (15 minutes from our farm) to meet the group and enjoy a quick dinner. The quick dinner turned into a few beers (Cheladas nonetheless!) and a lot of good stories. They are good people. The Pennsylvania boys had carted down a big bag of homemade smoked cheese from home and Bump (no shit that was his name) suggested I take a chunk for my start out in Springer. He gave me a chunk the size of a softball! Let's call it a Pennsylvania smoked pepper jack cheese incident. Next, a while back kid at the Magic Cauldron (place here in Houston that you could get all kinds of things including incense, sage essential oil and probably even stuff you could use to put a hex on your boss) mentioned that he collects animal skulls. That's a different collection, but who am I to judge. Running across a skull is not unusual in the woods. Throughout the fall and winter I remembered to collect anything that I found and ended up with a small bag of coyote and deer skulls. I dropped them off today as I decided I needed to buy a small vial of patchouly oil. I figured if I'm going to stink I might as will stink like a hippy. When I went to pay for the patchouly oil he said consider it a trade for the skulls. Sweet! Finally, last weekend I stuck my farm truck up at our farm. Think stuck, like real bad ....as in up to the axles. I called on my good friend Bob. Sensing my stress level peaking at 9 or a 10 with the anticipation of the hike, Bob told me to just leave it and he would round up the Chester Boys and take care of it. Bob runs with a posse of guys that pretty much live for this shit, and I knew I was in good hands. So the truck stayed buried in the woods and I went home. Yesterday, armed with winches and a come-along the Chester, Texas army went to work on my problem. 20 minutes later and several Natural Lights my farm truck was free from it's mire. Bob, Butch and Jason retired to my summer kitchen where they found that I had left a 30 pack of Natural Lights in the refrigerator for the the celebration of the liberation of the stuck F150. I told Bob,and I meant it, that if the shit ever hits the fan and I had to climb into a landing craft to invade another country or something wacky that ....I wouldn't go if guys like Bob, Jason and Butch were not also in the same landing craft. These are not ""let's catch a grande-latte at Starbucks"" kind of guys and the world needs more of them.On a final note I just received my REI dividend letter today in the mail and it's over 100 bucks... Which pretty much means I spent way too much money at the co-op this year. Crazy thing is I am done with buying crap for my hike. I am going to buy a pair of Keen river shoes with the dividend money and the 20% off coupon which ironically expires April 4th, the day I will be landing in Atlanta. I'll either have Kelly mail these out when it gets to be hot or they'll be waiting for me when I get home. It's getting close.",,Trail Magic - Tejas style!,"Mar 16, Wed",0

I hunted with my Nephew Phillip and we were crafty enough to fool one gobbler Saturday morning.Special thanks to Justin Wisian and his dad Mike, they were kind enough to invite me out to their place.

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526467,"So Kelly and I finally made it to Georgia and we ran the gauntlet of country roads, forest service roads, logging trails and abandoned paths and found the secret entrance to Springer Mountain, which houses the southern terminus of the longest footpath in our country.... US Forest Service Road #42. Upon arrival it was evident we weren't the only sleuths in the woods as there were several people parked at ""the bat entrance"".Our plan was to hike the one-mile back to the start of the trail ( why do all my adventures always start by going in the wrong direction?), relax a bit, take a few pictures, sign the log and then walk another mile back to the car. With this accomplished Mile One of my hike would be in the books. From there we would take it to Amicola Falls State Park, drink wine and rest our tired bones.So that being done, this officially means my start date was today (April 4) and my total trip miles northbound so far is 1 mile. Just so that I clear the air, I did carry my backpack the two mile round-trip.... despite the obvious lack of need, there was no way in hell I was slack packing the 1st mile of this epic adventure, to do so seems as if that would earn instant bad karma. I did however let Kelly carry it some of the way.... You know, just so she could experience it. Since it was late in the day by the time we reached the start of the trail the place was fairly deserted. We saw one other thru-hiker (Emily from Montana) sign in and do a quick about face and started heading back north. In the log we also noted several other thru-hikers who had come and gone earlier in the day. At the top we also met Stephen and Johnathon, a father son team from Georgia who had hiked some 17 miles today from Woody Gap. After we did the mile back to the parking lot Stephen asked if we could give them a ride down off the bumpy Forest Service road where his wife was to pick them up. We were happy to save her the grind as Forest Service Road #42 is as advertised.....a bumpy ride. We ended up giving the father son team a ride back to Amicola Falls State Park where his wife was waiting. They then offered to return the favor by dropping a box of resupply items at Mountain Crossings which was on their way home. This saved Kelly and I a haul. In addition they shared with us many great thoughts on hiking AT Georgia as they had hiked most of it. They were also generous enough to give me some great maps that will serve as supplements to AWOLs!It's been a long day starting all the way back home in Houston. I am very excited to head back up and start mile two in the morning. It's going to be odd as my one mile partner Kelly will be dropping me off and getting back to holding the fort down as I blaze on.","Southern terminus

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526590,"I was hiker #1,289 as we signed in at Amicola Falls this morning after a quick breakfast with Kelly. She had to get back to the Atlanta airport so my insertion was to be hasty.We made the kidney jarring ride back up Forest Service Road #42. It was cold still, colder than I anticipated. We said our good-byes and I was off. Yes, the good-bye was not all that easy on either side of the hugs. I made it to my designated goal by about 4 pm(Hawk Mountain Shelter). There was space in the shelter so my first night on the AT I will be battling Hawk Mountain Shelter mice.I could have pushed for a few more miles, but I wanted to start off slow. I am feeling good.I met some good people today including trail ridge runners and several thru-hikers. People from all over....Matt from Manhattan, Code and DJ from Mass. These were younger cats and after breaking at Hawk Mountain they moved on.I visited with Kennebec for a while. He is an 80 year old guy. Ya, not a type O.... 80!!! He was from Maine, but now lives in Florida. He was day three into his hike. He seemed a little down about his progress. I listened and we discussed options. I suggested he keeps trucking along and when the April bubble plays out in Georgia, come off the trail and rest, then shuttle up to Trail Days and catch back up with the bubble. I could tell he really enjoyed my visit. We were soon joined by Huckleberry who is 70. I realized I was 20 years YOUNGER than the hikers I was conversing with. Then I was humbled by being left in Huckleberry's dust when our conversation with Kennebec ended. Huckleberry is here at Hawk Mountain tonight... He is playing the slow as you go game. The same game I am playing. Many people have piled into into the shelter for the evening now. I was told by the ridge runners that over 30 people started today. End of a good day. I am going to go for Woody Gap tomorrow.Things I realized as I took my first steps this morning....1. I will miss Kelly, 2. I will make it to Maine and 3.

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526707,"4/6 - Day TwoI was happy with my decision to pick the loft at the Hawk Mountain Shelter when the winds in the middle of the night turned intense. I was warm, comfortable and there was minimal snoring taking place. Additionally, the feared shelter mice did not show.I woke up early. Several of the tent campers had already pressed on. Not wanting to stir the shelter I stayed in my bag until about 8 am. I woke up, had a hot cup of coffee and jetted.Today I would tackle Sassafras Mountain and Justus Mountain. Both are inappropriately named. Their names should be Kick Your Ass Mountain and Kick Your Ass Mountain Part Two. The talk is today's hike is the hardest part of Georgia.I hiked most the day with J and we met along the way several folks from Hawk Mountain. We were going to press on to Woody Gap, but with rain in the forecast for night, we stopped at Gooch Mountain Shelter. Many of the people who are here tonight I already met along the way. Giant is a .... Well a tall dude....that is on his THIRD thru-hike. H us a good cat and offers good advice.I am staying once again in a loft. Piled up top are Walt (who carries a ukulele), Jake from New York (yup two Jakes in one shelter), J, Trek (who also slept in the loft last night) and guest of honor Peach. Peach is a southbound hiker who will finish the trail at Springer tomorrow. Peach has been on the trail for 10 months (including injury and dead of winter hiatus). He hiked through most of winter. Impressive.I am feeling good. Definately sore. The slow as you go plan is the way to go (for me anyway).

I heard the rain for a minute and heard two loud clasps of thunder. It made for great sleeping because we were dry. So that means I slept good. I hiked all day with Giant. We shared a common pace. Many people who camped with us at Gooch are heading into Neels Gap tonight. Giant and I stopped at the Woods Hole shelter for the night. Mountain Goat, Smoke and Bob from NH are here. Our plan is to tackle Blood Mountain in the morning and head into Neels Gap. Blood Mountain is the highest point on the AT in Georgia. This way we will get there early and get a bunk room for Friday night. We already have a small group to split the cost of the bunk house up. I will get my resupply box from Mountain Crossings... Thank you Stephen again for dropping it off.The Woods Hole Shelter is small. It is within the restrictive bear canister area where bear canisters are required. Because we have so little food left, we are going to put in what's left after dinner into some section camper's bear canisters.I planned the first few days right. I have just enough food and will roll into Neels Gap completely light and foodless.At Woody Gap there were garbage cans. We threw away our trash. So with no food or garbage my pack is only about 25 pounds. I am carrying minimal water as springs are available. The powder Gatorade and Kool Aid makes the water taste good.I am ready to tackle Blood Mountain in the morning and kick it for the rest of the day at Neels. More rain is expected tonight and I actually was rained on as we made it to the shelter.Wildlife sightings so far consist of one ruffed grouse and an area that looked pretty well rooted up by hogs. It's raining now. Night three of the AT and I am once again in a warm shelter. A guy named Smoke we have been hiking with just came. He was rained on at the end of his hike and fell into hypothermic conditions. We found him a space blanket and I got him into a sleeping bag. It's cool...50 degrees and raining. And he is over there shivering and babbling. It looks like he will survive, but this is prime hypothermia temps and conditions.Saturday temps are supposed to be low and possible snow. Hiking in the day is a mix between warm and cold.... Depends on what side of the mountain you are on. I have not overpacked. Tonight will be cold.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526987,"4/8 - Day FourLast night was a rough not for the crew in Woods Hole Shelter. After the hypothermia scare we all eased into our places. Seems like everyone was tossing and turning. There was a reported snorer....but I did not hear it as I was asleep every time the snorer started snoring. We had a short day today. Up Blood Mountain and back down into Neels Gap. The hike up was not hard and due to fresh legs, cool morning temps and full stomachs we were up on top of the highest peak in Georgia along the AT (4,400 feet or so). The view was good and the Shelter at the top was made of stone and very cool. I was told it was the oldest shelter on the AT?The hike down to Neels Gap is billed as an ass kicker, but I thought it was moderate. It might have something to do with knowing we were stopping at Neels Gap for the night. Carrying light packs with no food also helped. It also did not hurt to hear rumors of hamburgers and hotdogs being given away at Neels Gap!At Neels Gap is the famous outfitter, Mountain Crossings. The AT runs through the building and is the only part of the AT that is covered. We all bought $18 bunks in the hostel that is part of Mountain Crossings. We originally intended to stay at Blood Mountain cabins down the road, but they were sold out.The hostel is very cool and filled up fast. Alot of hikers we have now seen for a few days are here and more are down at Blood Mountain cabins. It will be a big day launching out of here in the morning with the crew.Right now I am waiting on the washer. To be honest, I don't feel dirty or grimey. I am going to shower here shortly... I think everyone has gone ahead of me.Me and Giant tried are luck at hitching to town for beer. But no one wanted to pick us up. I told him it was due to the fact he is 6.9 and was wearing goofy hiker shades he found in the hiker box in the hostel. There was all kinds of stuff in the hiker box... I scored a few things, but most of the stuff is in there for a reason. Right now there is a sweet Buck knife that is too heavy to consider. Seems like all the big cutlery gets ditched! In the hiker box there was a lot of good food, as folks tend to overpack at first. Giant scored when two Canadian guys that were with us ended their section hike a complete resupplied him with their leftovers! In addition to pots, Gold Bond, bear spray, there was a ton of bug spray in the hiker box.I have taken a shower now. So everyone knows, for your $18 you get a shower which is monitored by the towel you are given. Laundry is $5 and that gets you a packet of detergent.I am excited to start again in the morning. It is supposed to be cold. We have to be out of here by 9am and we are going to do 11 miles. Regarding Smoke and his near death hypothermia.... He couldn't understand how the cold ""got him"" after all he lives in his grandma's attic in Cleveland. It really may have been his pack weight, which weighed in at a hefty 50 pounds here at Neels Gap. Yup, the character factor is high here in the AT!","Woods Hole Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527130,"4/9 - Day FiveThe AT is 2,185 miles long. Everyone talks about the number of footsteps it takes to complete a thru-hike, but no one talks about the number of decisions that have to be made along the way.I had to make a decision this morning. To jet out of Neels Gap and make it either 6.7 miles to the first shelter (Whitney Gap) or continue to Low Gap Shelter, 11.1 miles out. The third choice was to zero here and avoid what is predicted to be a very cold (25 degrees) night on the trail.I decided to zero. I am feeling good, but many of my crew decided to rent a cabin at Blood Mountain and bypass the extreme temperature and make up the lost miles in the morning.My 12W Vasque boots that I wore all year prior to my hike are hurting. Word of advice to anyone thinking about giving the AT a go, don't disregard the advice that your feet will swell. Mine did, big time and I have the blisters to show for it. So imagine my surprise when I found an almost brand new pair of Vasque boots (same exact pair I had in 12w) in 13M laying on the floor in Mountain Crossings. I asked the guy if they were tree boots (hikers who give up here at Neels Gap ceremoniously throw their boots into the tree at Mountain Crossing). He said no, but I could have them....score! So part of my zero day today is testing out my new 13's. So far I think the 12's are going home to Kelly.The character factor here is high. Let me see if I can break it down into general classifications:Over 60 and in shape: These fuckers evidently found the fountain of youth somewhere along the way. I will toss Huckleberry, Montana Craig and Bob from NH into this grouping. They are friendly at camp, but don't snuggle too close as these guys will be leave ya in the morning with a simple ""happy trails"". You won't see them again, they are big mile folks.Over 60 and out of shape: Other than Kennebec (who I met on day one), I have not really interacted with this species. From what I am told, by Neels Gap these folks have tapped out.The Dog People: This species contains two subspecies. The prepared dog people and the unprepared dog people. The unprepared dog people do stupid shit like leave out of Amicola Falls with 25 pounds of Old Roy.... Ya I said it, 25 pounds of dog chow! I did not actually see her, but hikers who did say she and Fido turned around before getting to Springer. J (the cat I hiked with on day two) and I met another girl with a dog. She was at a gap and seemed disoriented and was trying to find a ride to town.... To get more dog food. The prepared dog people on the other hand seem to have their shit together. Lost Souls: These bastards come in all shapes and forms. There is no minimum age and damn sure no sign this says ""you must be this tall to ride"". These cats are generally solo. And just because they are lost souls does not mean they are clueless. A lot of these guys and girls are showing up to play and win. I intend to do further research on this classification.Young Cats Not Lost Yet: Another large showing.l on the AT, I will toss Mountain Goat, Feel Good (formerly Jake, Magic Man (formerly Walter) (why can't he carry a banjo because I can't spell yukalaee?) and of course Trek. Trek is a bonafide Jewish rabbi who admitted that he was mostly in it for the bagels.And then there is the Hiker Trash.....I think Giant might be the leader of this group. These are hikers who for whatever reason found this walk in da woods addictive and have made it their life....and they have the trail tattoos as further proof of their unlimited devotion. The label Hiker Trash is worn proudly, and they earned it. These types make it to Maine fueled by trail knowledge, hiker box scores and ganja. Think the tortoise and the hare. I think this group goes all the way. Why not, they seem to have the most time?The zero day did get a little long, however I was able to get caught up on rest and texts. I am very ready to hit the trail in the morning, but curious to see how my resupplied pack will do as it is stuffed for the next four days.","Mountain Crossings - Neels Gap

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527312,"4/10 - Day SixWe ate breakfast at the cabin and headed out leaving Neels Gap, Mountain Crossings and Blood Mountain Cabins behind. The goal was to do 11.5 miles to Low Gap shelter which we pulled off.The walk was not difficult, but my feet and legs felt tired by the time we made it into Low Gap.The ass kicker of the day was the Wildcat Mountain right before Hog Pen Gap!   Oddly enough no one warns you about Wildcat Mountain, it just appears.We took it at a slow pace and when we finally crested the top we still had gas in our tanks and we were hardly sweating. This is nice as the wind can cool you down quickly.We gave up our hard earned elevation gains when the trail descended into Hog Pen Gap. At Hog Pen Gap there was a lot of cars. The spring that is the only water source was weak. Giant and AFK grab bottles and went to the spring as I watched the packs.As they were down there a trail angel pulled up and was dropping a guy named Nick and his dog Vinny off at the trail. The man tossed me a bottle of Dasani, and it was very appreciated. As I was waiting for Giant and AFK to come back with water several other hikers came through all heading for Low Gap.A girl named Janett and her dog Kica Bear came by. Both Nick and Janett are here at Low Gaps. Their dogs are absolutely cool and were hanging out earlier. There is a good group here tonight. A guy named Ranger we met, Mountain Goat just came in (he was hiking slow with his wife), Smoke and many others. At Hogpen Gap I met J's wife Sarah. She was hiking with J and was returning to the gap to go home. She asked me if I was Jake! I said yes. Evidently NH Bob is ahead and told them about the big hypothermia scare the other night. The story is running our section of the trail.Today's hike included some nice ridge walks. This makes the walking easier, but the wind can be punishing. We were happy to see Low Gap as it lives up to its name and is low and wind free. As I type this I am crushing a good Mountain House dinner (Chicken and Rice) with Kica Besr laying next to me in the shelter. Once again I am sleeping in a shelter... My tent has become a pillow.","Blood Mountain Cabins

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527451,"4/11 - Day SixI had my days wrong up until now. Today is day six on the AT and I just finished a short 7.3 miles to Blue Mountain Shelter. Not exactly the longest day, but there is rain in forecast and the next shelter is 8 miles away and on top of Tray Mountain. Tray is billed as ""one you will remember"" and ""brutal"". So the call was made to chill at Blue Mountain, stay dry and hit Tray fresh.Getting to camp early enough means that I am once again in a shelter. Regarding shelter sites, there are camping areas along the way, but they are fairly spread out and often lack water. Stealth camping is possible, but wind comes into play as well as the slope of the hills. Camp in the wind and your night will suck. The morning when we left Low Gap it was gloomy and looked like rain. Many hikers left hunkered under rain jackets and pack covers. The gloom lasted until about 11 and then burned off. I broke out my rain jacket for the first time for about half a mile.The first part of today's hike was an easy ridge walk. I noticed that part of it traversed along an old road bed that ran along the ridge. This was the first sign of any former civilization on the hike so far. I am feeling a little behind, but I keep seeing familiar faces... So I am definately not the only one on the ""slow as you go"" program. My pace will pick up after awhile and I plan on spending less time in towns like Hiawassee to make up for the slower pace. All the young punks burning up the trail plan to spend a night in Hiawassee or at the Top of Georgia hostel. I will deal with being dirty.... It has not bothered me yet at all.There is a funny story making its way up the trail. Evidently some guy earned his trail name on night one when he accidently discharged his bear spray inside his tent. He is now known as Mace. I spoke to another guy named Blaze of Glory today. He was carrying bear spray (second person I have seen). Blaze said he wish he had the best spray with him on his last hike as he ran into a bear and a cub. I paused for a second then said.... Well it looks like you survived the encounter. We both laughed.I have been meeting all kinds of people from all over. Giant and I ate lunch today on the trail with two dudes from an island in Maine. We both agreed these dudes had what it took to walk back home and they sported Down East Dickering beards to prove it. When we left them we laughed thinking about the fact that the cooler temps (to me) were more like a heat wave to these guys. Familiar faces are now filtering into the shelter. I think the short day was a good call.","Low Gap Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527609,"4/12 - Day SevenI woke up before light today when stirring in the shelter brought the end to the Blue Mountain Shelter Snoreathon. I was told I took second place.Giant and Smoke were already shoving off. Evidently, Giant concluded the hiking in the Georgia Mountains in early April without a tent or sleeping bag was a bad idea. He had his dad mail his stuff to Helen and the plan was for him and Smoke to run in and get it and we all meet up at Tray Mountain Shelter tonight.I shoved off about 45 minutes after them alone. I was hiking in the mist and everything was wet. The first challenge was to descend down into Unicoi Gap (where a road passes through). The descent was not treacherous, but I had to watch wet flat rocks as these were a sure fire way to end up on your ass. Despite the slick rocks I made it down quietly. I was hoping to slip up on some critters, but all I saw was a squirrel.It is interesting in that above 2,500 feet the mountains are dead. Once you hike below 2,500 one noticed buds and some green. I am assuming most animals are ""off the mountain"" as what has to be an annual bumper crop of acorns are long gone.I made it into Unicoi Gap (1,000 feet descent). I was gearing up to make the next ascent (which was indeed an ass kicker) when I saw Giant and Smoke getting out of a pickup. Evidently they caught a quick ride and the guy even brought them back!!! So we started up the next climb. Between the Tray Mountain Shelter and us sat Rocky Mountain and then the king ass kicker Tray Mountain.I don't get the names of these mountains? Tray Mountain. I think ""The Mountain That Never Ends"" is more appropriate. Just as you thought you hit the top there was another switchback and more damn mountain to climb. I am glad to say the climb up Tray Mountain is behind me.Just as soon as the trail crests the top of Tray it starts to give up hard won elevation and descends down to where I am tonight, at the Tray Mountain Shelter. The total hiking distance today was 8 miles, but it was a real 8 miles with few breaks. Many people are still coming into the shelter area and most settled with limited miles due to the Tray Climb. I am feeling physically in great shape. Today's hike was tough, but I did it.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527837,"4/13 - Day Eight The dynamics of the trail changed today. Last night Giant made the sudden decision that the place he needed to be was further ahead on the trail.... Like Fontana Dam (100 miles or so up trail). His idea was to crank up the miles. I have no doubt that this guy could do consistent 20 mile days with his stride and size 18 feet. Yes, size 18! So I told him I would catch up to him at Fontana (which is right before the Smokies). So this means I would be hiking alone hiking out of Tray Mountain Shelter. This morning everyone was up early, there was hiking on the agenda! As I crawled out of my mummy bag, Smoke was scratching his head trying to figure out what ate the pop-tart that he left in his pocket. Andy, Ranger, Big Deal and Mr. and Mrs. Mass, Giant and a few others were squaring their things away and prepping to ""head out"". For whatever reason the sunup scramble is fun. Everyone seems to move in a determined way packing up what they unpacked the night before. Today my destination was Dick's Creek Gap where I planned to then hike the half-mile down the hill and score a bunk at The Top of Georgia Hostel. The fast trackers left first....Giant and Smoke. Then Ranger. Followed by The Masses and then Andy. I was out about 15 minutes after all of them and I was hell-bent at catching at least some of them. With haul-ass on my mind, before I left the shelter I pulled a deer hunting trick and stashed my coat in my pack before launching.The theory is to start cold like when you walk to your deer stand in the morning. Most hikers start bundled up and then stop a half mile down to stash their jacket. So starting cold and with a descent off of Tray Mountain I was in high gear. Part of my motivation was that the hostel offers free shuttles to Hiawassee, but the last shuttle leaves at 4 pm. If I could make the 11.5 miles to Dick's Creek Gap by 4 pm and maybe catch up to some of my shelter-mates, I would call today a success. Not far down the trail I met Smoke and Ranger. Giant left him in the dust. Evidently Smoke took a right out of the shelter and started heading south, (how he did this I have no clue as he left with Giant)?Smoke, Ranger and I hiked at a good pace for a while and finally caught Andy and then The Masses who where relaxing in the trail with Giant (who was waiting for Smoke). So we all began hiking at individual paces. Stopping, pausing, eating and watering. One thing I noticed today was that my lungs were finally accepting full loads and my up hill pauses are becoming shorter and shorter. I guess it took a week to acclimate from Houston air to Georgia Mountain air?My hike ended at 3 pm when I popped out at Dick's Creek Gap. There was one unnamed ass-kicker ascent in the 11.5 miles and the descent into Dick's Creek Gap seemed to go on forever.I met the posse at the road. Everyone was heading down to Top of Georgia Hostel other than Giant and Smoke. They were heading to the next shelter. So we piled up to the hostel and there we found several of the fast young punks who we started with in day one. I thought I would never see them again, but they were chilling out and resting hurting knees. Janet and her dog is also here. I chatted with her for a while and found out she was from West Virginia, but living in Terlinqua, Tx (think Big Bend area) for the last two years. The group here is great. There are thru-hikers, section hikers and some people who seem to be making the hostel their new home. Several of us including Andy, Big Deal (who we met at Blood Mountain Cabins, Shawn, The Masses, Stretch and several others were shuttled into Hiawassee and dropped off at Daniel's Streakhouse. Daniel's offers an all you can eat buffet and we absolutely crushed it!!!Then we walked to Ingles and resupplied. Like most, I bought way to much food and I will be leaving Top of Georgia Hostel heavy! Tomorrow's hike is not easy, but it puts me across the Georgia/North Carolina line. Yes sir....goodbye Georgia and hello North Carolina!!","Tray Mountain Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527985,"4/14 - Day NineWow! What a day. It started at 7 am when my alarm went off at the hostel. In a moment the sunrise scramble was in full force as hikers packed their kits with resupply goods and fresh laundry. The first shuttle to the heady left at 8. I took my time as my laundry was floating around somewhere. Andy was nice enough to let me throw a few things in with his stuff since the maximum ""load"" is 5 pounds of grungy hiker wear.So by the time I packed the food I bought at Ingles into my pack and chased down laundry it was 10 am and the last shuttle was leaving. I weighed my pack as I got on the shuttle and it was 33 pounds. Big Deal (who was on the shuttle) joked that the next resupply we should fill individual carts and then at check out scuttle one. We all over supplied. In the end I tossed a full jar of PB&J into the hiker box. The damn jar weighed 1.5 pounds. What was I thinking?Andy was in the shuttle, but hardly ready for the trail. The hostel vortex had grabbed him and he was thinking of pulling a zero. The hostel vortex sucks hikers in with hot coffee, electricity, running water and a unlimited supply of VCR movies. Now I know where all the old VCRs are!!!On the shuttle was Andy, Big Deal, Janett and her dog, a guy from Alaska and his super cool husky, Tracie and a few others.Tracie's boyfriend Odie thru-hiked in 2013 and is now making AT yearbooks. He is following the bubble in a school bus promoting this cool idea. Check out hikeryearbook.comSo when we got to the heady I was feeling the Hiawassee Resupply Blues. Tracie, Janett and Deal bolted ahead of me. They are fast!This left me alone for the morning. That's when I realized I lost today's page the I ripped from AWOLs guide. Tearing the page out of the book makes it easier to find... Until you lose it. So I hiked blind most the day until I caught up with Big Deal and Janett having lunch. There I soaked in as much Intel as possible and discovered Bly Gap and the NC border was just four miles away. Piece of cake.After yo-yoing with a group of section hikers all day I started to run low on water. I knew the NC border was close and I wanted to arrive there with someone to take a picture. But that was not going to happen. I ran out of water and had to scrounge some mountain sludge from a seep. My Sawyer Mini Squeeze was put to the test as this water was nasty. I drank a bottle of it and chilled for a moment. I started hiking and discovered Bly Gap and the NC border was less than 200 yards away followed by the Bly Gap camp site.... With a clear stream!!!But as luck would have it here comes Feel Good and a girl from NH named Pending. We took each other's pictures at the border sign and refilled dirty water bottles with clean Bly Gap water. Pending pitched her tent and said she was done. Feel Good and I had other plans...,Muskrat Creek Shelter, about three miles up the trail.Now Feel Good is a 25 year old kid and, since I was still hiking with limited Intel, told me that the climb out of Bly Gap was a ""double bitch"". And he was right!!!! Halfway up his hiking pal Magic Man comes running up the mountain. Literally running up the mountain. He stayed back at hostel waiting on a package which evidently came in. He also bought a Purple Rain hiker skirts. I don't know what a little ventilation down there does but he was out of sight in no time. Just imagine a dude wearing a hiking skirt and carrying a eukele kicking your ass. (Note... Magic Man and Feel Good's combined age equals my age so I have an excuse).So I finally made it to Muskrat Creek Shelter! There was a big crowd, most of the hikers from the hostel were there. The shelter was sold out..so I am typing this from my tent (first time I set it up on my journey).As I was approaching the shelter about a half mile out I noticed atv tracks on the AT and a spot where something evidently slid off the trail. When I got to the shelter, Tracie told me there was a big rescue today. I hiker had went off the deep end and was lost for three days. The rescue team came up on atvs and one fell off the trail at the spot I noticed. They finally found the hiker and took him down in a stokes basket on the atv.So here is the wacky part. After the rescue team found the hiker they came to the Muskrat Creek Shelter. This hiker that stayed in the bunk next to me in the hostel last night decided to call it quits because he was low on Pepsi so he paid the rescue guys money for the 15 mile atv ride out of here. I knew this cat was an odd one when at the hostel last night he was going through his ""medical kit"" and asked me if I wanted a self suture kit ,... You know, in case you get cut and you have to sew yourself up. I declined. For being in the middle of nowhere there sure is never a dull moment.","Top of Georgia Hostel

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528098,"4/15. - Day TenAfter yesterday's ""the welcome to North Carolina crap out"" I slept in today until about 8:30. It is tougher to get up out of a tent versus a shelter.I went up to the shelter to make coffee. Several hikers that stayed in camp were gone. Big Deal, who normally is not an early starter, left at 9:30. It was 10:00 before I had my shit together. By then people who stayed down in Bly Gap were stopping in Muskrat Creek for a break. Andy showed up. He attempted the ""double bitch"" out of Bly Gap and settled on stealth camping after the first ""bitch"". I think he was glad to see familiar faces as he camped all alone. The Mass came into the shelter, they also stayed at Bly Gap.So I was the last one to hit the trail with exception to Magic Man and Feel Good. When I left I could hear eukele music coming from Magic Man's tent.   I hiked out of camp with another hiker named Brandon (no trail name yet). I wonder if two Brandon's ever hiked together on the AT before. Regardless, it was short lived as I had a faster pace on what would prove to be fairly easy walking today.The big climb to 5,400 feet was the climb up Standing Indian Mountain. Because the Standing Indian Shelter is 1/4 the way up, I planned to eat lunch there. The Mass planned the same. As we were eating Brandon rolled in and another couple from Mass and then Ranger.The last I saw Ranger was when I passed the Plumborchard Gap Shelter yesterday. He was hanging out at the ""mushroom tent"". The mushroom tent is a multi-person tent that looks like the dwarf spawn of a M.A.S.H tent and a circus tent with a heavy dose of psychodelia. Ranger informed me that a group of 10 younger kids from Oklahoma created it. The Okies were here to 1) smoke pot, 2) pontificate the existence of extraterrestrials and alien abductions and 3) hike to Maine (in that order of priority as they have been at it since March 15 and only hiked that far).Evidently Ranger fell into their vortex. As I ate my AT pizza (tortilla, pepperoni, gooda cheese drenched in olive oil) Ranger rambled on about UFOs. His point was that the more you think about the existence of aliens the more likely they exist. I asked him if that theory carried over to beer and if I thought about a cold six pack of Tecates would they appear? The notion seemed to slip pass him.So after lunch the lunch bunch headed out to tackle the rest of Standing Indian Mountain. I left last as I had to fill up my water bottles. Ranger and the Masses left ahead of me.The break of the day came when I realized the trail up Standing Indian followed an old road bed. This meant many switchbacks, but a reasonable grade. I was flying up it. Now here is the weird part... I looked behind me and here comes Ranger!!!! I have no idea how he got in back of me? UFOs? Alien Abduction?After the long, but fairly easy climb up Standing Indian Mountain the trail began its descent. It was a long and easy descent. Easiest walking so far. I put on my iPod and cruised. I made it to Beech Gap Campsite by 4:30 but I had more energy. The next shelter was Carter Gap Shelter 3 miles away. I thought to myself... That's one lap around Memorial Park (park in Houston where I walked in preparation for my hike) and the terrain seemed almost the same with exception to an end of the day 400 feet climb. So I went for it and it was good walking. The walking was easy with exception to roots. I crossed over two decent size mountain stream (one was big enough to maybe even hold trout?). Also in the 3 miles the landscape change to a heavy understory of Rodadundren Trees (spelling?). These trees are NC's answer to Texas's Yaupon Tree. They cover the mountains.So I hiked into Carter Gap where there were familiar faces. I am told the hike tommorrow is not as easy as today's, which was the easiest so far.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528302,"4/16 - Day TenThe day started out weirdly enough with me crawling out of my sleeping bag and schlupping up to the shelter where much to my surprise everyone was still sleeping!!!I quietly made coffee (I swear Kelly I resisted the urge to be noisy) as the folks in the shelter began to awake. Josh, a hiker from the Netherlands who also slept in a tent was already packed and gone.... Everyone else was asleep.I broke down my tent and headed out with Janette and Kia Bear (her dog) followed by Tracie. Magic Man and Feel Good who hiked in after dark stayed behind. Brooklyn Shawn, Larry (former AFK) and Nemo all left about the same time. I was pacing good with Tracie (Janette and Kia Bear pulled ahead) when a south bounder told us there was trail magic at the next gap!!!!Tracie and I kicked it into high gear and in about 30 minutes hit Mooney Gap where the Okonee Hiking Club was holding a full on hiker feed!!! Think of this.... Hiking 5 miles and stumbling upon ice cold Mountain Dews, Fritos, sandwiches and comfortable chairs!!! It was blissful and the kind people were so nice. They made me a three meat sandwhich with Swiss Cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and banana peppers!!! I am slightly embarrassed to say I sucked down three Mountain Dews!!!Every silver lining has a touch of gray and to an AT hiker the term ""gap"" means a climb out!   In our case it meant a climb up Albert Mountain with a belly full of deli meat!!! As I was putting on my pack hikers continued to drop into the feed. As they emerged out if the woods everyone would cheer. Just as I was leaving my boy Ranger popped out and quickly started rob grub down. At the top of Albert Mountain is a fire tower. The climb out of Mooney Gap starts innocently enough and then turns serious. Think rock scrambling. Now think of doing this with a Dagwood Sandwhich in your stomach!! I made the climb with a son who was part of a father and son section hike team. Both father and son had capabilities and I scrambled between the two as son outpaced dad.The last 200 feet of elevation gain was intense. When I made it to the top everyone was chilling out, checking out the view and climbing to to top of the fire tower.After celebrating surviving the brutal post trail magic haul we put our packs on and started cruising. We had 4 more miles to hike to get to Rock Gap Shelter. The good news was the hike was moderate. At Rock Gap a big group decided to get a shuttle into Franklin, NC and take a zero on Sunday. Although I still had plenty food I needed to grab a mail drop that Kelly sent and a day rest sounded good.Larry and I split a room. He wasn't up to go out, but I was hell bent on stopping in at The Lazy Hiker Brewery. I also stopped at Gooder Groove hostel where I saw Smoke and Stretch and a bunch of other characters. The Gooder Groove hostel is new this year and comes complete with a mellow hippie vibe. They were having a bonfire, keg of beer and BBQ. A few hikers from the northern element of the mushroom tent people were playing instruments. Evidently the mushroom tent people have a northern and southern group. They were very good musicians and it added to the vibe. In addition Pony was staying there. Pony is a dude that kinda looks like Richard Branson. I met him at Muskrat Creek briefly. Pony and I talked for a while and it turns out he is writing a book about his grandfather who posthumously won the Medal of Honor at the Battle of Tarawa (in the Pacific) in 1943. The book is about his grandfather and how the family went back a few years ago and found his remains! For whatever reason the Battle of Tarawa intrigues me and Pony and I had a great discussion. He has to leave the trail on Memorial Day to speak in New Orleans at the WW2 Museum about how he found his grandfather. Another great day with great people. I am sore, tired, my little toe looks like it went through a meat grinder and I am very happy.","Carter Gap Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528491,"4/17 - Day ElevenToday was a zero day. I started the day by picking up a box Kelly had mailed to the Three Eagles Outfitters. The box contained new reading glasses, deer jerky, Powder drink mix, my Carolina Panthers bandana, a cotton shirt and three Mountain House meals. Thank you Kelly!!! I was given a lift over to the outfitters by a mother/daughter team who had driven down from NJ to pick up a rabbit! I shared the back seat with a rabbit in a cardboard box. The daughter had thru-hiked last year and she met someone who raised rabbits in NC (or GA?) and used it as a reason to come down and see her friend. After picking up the box I headed to the Lazy Hiker. The entire crew showed up at the Lazy Hiker Brewery here in Franklin, NC. The entire crew! Hikers came and went all afternoon. Frolic and Lee ducked in for ""one quick one"" and planned to get right back on the trail. Three hours later and several Slackpacker IPAs later their plans changed. It is unbelievable how many hikers I have gotten to know in the short time on the trail. I am staying at the Gooder Grove Hiker Hostel this evening. I am well rested and resupplied and ready to hike in the morning. The mood here is mellow tonight. I want to throw a special shout out to Zen. Zen runs the Gooder Grove and he is a great mellow guy. He spent the day shuttling hikers all over Franklin.","Gooder Grove Hostel

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528647,"4/18 - Day TwelveThe day started at 9 am in the Gooder Grove Hostel. I am confident I was the first one up. Where as at the Top of Georgia Hostel (TOG) the sunrise scramble was much earlier.... But then again there was not a half-keg of Slackpacker IPA to contend with at TOG. I was saved from falling into that keg trap simply because I do not dig IPA. Still, I was up late doing laundry and organizing my food bag (which I now call the blue brick). Someone popped in Clockwork Orange on the TV and I watched it. So it was a little late of a night.At Gooder Grove time moves in a different way. Escaping the vortex of any hostel can be a challenge...Gooder Grove is like Hotel California, you can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.However, leave we did at high noon. Our escape vehicle would be Tony's (Twin States) rented mini-van. Tony announced yesterday he was coming off the trail due to some personal things that he had to take care off. He was splitting back to Vermont and was kind enough to take us to the heady.On the way out we stopped at Taco Bell so it was 1 pm before we said our good byes and started to hike. We crammed 6 not so stinky hikers in Tony's van and 1 dog. At the heady Trek (The Vicious Rabi) was waiting for us.We all started where we left. There was a vote on whether to blow of the 4 miles from Rock Gap and pick up at Winding Stair Gap. Unanimously all hikers voted to go back to Rock Gap and stay true to the trail. The 4 miles between Rock Gap and Winding Stair Gap is one up and down and some hikers were debating skipping it.Right before we left Gooder Grove some of the Okie Hippies were playing Led Zepplin songs on their little backpacking guitars. I like Zepplin, but I don't reach for them much on my IPod... But damn I wanted to here some Zepplin! So I put the headset on and started hiking. I hit shuffle on some greatest hit compilation I have and enjoyed a song or two. Then I rounded a bend and I was faced with a set of long wooden steps in the trail ascending upwards. And guess what song started to play? Stairway to Heaven. That kind of shit does not happen when you stay at TOG!Since we are on the subject... I thought about the differences between the two hostels as I walked and listened to Zepplin. TOG is operated by Sir Packs-A-Lot and at Gooder Grove you get Zen who ""is in charge"".Packs-A-Lot had information, like how to trim a pound off your pack or how not to blow your knee out on a descent. Zen on the other hand deals with bigger issues and theories. Wanna know about chemtrails, ozone depletion and global warming? Hitch a ride over to Ingles with Zen. Zen also makes you part of the hostel and invited me into a skull session on what color to paint the hostel (The color that that sun makes when it passes through the red maple in the side yard seemed to get the nod). Having made the color schematic decision the conversation went back to the April heat and the floods in Houston and changing global temperatures. One other difference between hostels... TOG has a strict ""no drugs or alcohol"" policy in the list of rules (damn if I did not feel naughty sucking down a screw off top Coors Light during my stay). Zen on the other hand simply asks you to chip in for some ice for the keg while at Ingles.So I hiked to Winding Stair Gap. I saw Janett (now Hula Bear) and her dog and we discussed destinations. Being tired we agreed to go 7.9 miles to Silba Bald shelter. If we felt good we would go on to some unnamed campsite at mile 118 as AWOLs indicated it had water.I crossed to highway and hiked up the forest service road. Where the AT started again there was an awesome waterfall. I kicked it for a minute and chatted with a southbound section hiker. As we talked I saw a small trout in the stream rise ....that was exciting.Pending caught up to me and so did Shawn, Nemo and Tracie. Before I knew it it was 6:30 and Tracie, Pending and I were at the Silba Bald Shelter sign. The conundrum was that the blue blaze to the shelter was .5 miles away and we did not want to go down there to see who was there. So we decided to do 4 more miles and hit a campsite with water. (Shelters have water, a table, privy and tent spots. Campsites just have water and tent sites). The challenge was the 4 miles came with a grueling 1,000 feet elevation change. I knew if I went for it my hike would end in the dark.So I said lets go! The girls soon left me in the dust (I would catch up to them eating dinner in the middle of the trail). But after their dinner they once again smoked me. But getting smoked was cool! It was getting dusky and the heat was cooling off (it was very warm today and I truly believe Zen is onto something with this global warming theory). I was not worried about night hiking as the moon was already showing bright. I planned on walking with the moon light once it was dark.But as luck would have it I spotted Tracie and Pending's tent in the campsite at mile 118. When I walked up they were already getting into their tents (having already eaten dinner on the trail). The campsite is small and it has running water close by. There is one other tent (we do not know who is inside). The rest of the crew is who knows where.So I pitched my tent. I was so tired having done another 12 miles (starting in the heat of the day). I sorted through the blue brick and decided on a big thing of Lipton Soup. The campsite was quiet (no fire). Everyone but me was asleep. The moon came out and it was light (I could see my shadow) I was perfectly still, not too cool and beautiful.On a sad note I received a text from Larry (AFK) as I ate. He tapped out today. He did not give me a full explanation, but it's sad to hear he is done. So today we lost two hikers. Larry did mention to me several days ago that his wife was not totally comfortable being alone at home. It's speculation if that is what lead to him getting off the trail. Regardless, I wanted to take this time to thank Kelly for being so supportive and and independent. Without an understanding spouse a thru-hike is doomed.I am happy with my progress, but unhappy with how heavy my blue brick has become!! I will be at NOC in 2 days and I bet I have 4 days of food on me!!! Part of my problem arevthese damn hikers boxes! I mean, who is not going to snatch up an unopened package of Elk Jerky? I need to get this straight... Extra weight sucks.","Rock Gap Heady

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528836,"4/19 - Day ThirteenWe rolled out of our tents about 7:30. As always I like to piddle a bit and soon Tracie, then Pending were off. The hikers in the tent below us moved on. They were a thru-hiker couple named Eric and Sparkles (I have not met them up until this morning). So after everyone hiked on I had the campsite to myself. I spent a little time reorganizing my blue brick (way to heavy food bag). I found a dehydrated Apple Cobbler in the blue brick last night. It was a hiker box score. Apple Cobbler!!! I don't ever eat that shit, but since I hauled it out I damn sure was going to try. So I ate Apple Cobbler for breakfast.... And it was damn good.With an attempt to decrease the obnoxious weight of the blue brick and to fill my stomachs I ate s Cliff Bar and s half of ziplock bag of GORP. That crap is heavy and the left overs went to the squirrels. When breakfast was all said and done the blue brick was then a reasonable heft.I was in the trail by 10 pm. It was odd as I walked a while without seeing anyone. My first live sighting of a human was a hiker named Random up at Wayah Bald stone tower. There was another hiker there who said he camped there and then Magic Man appeared.Magic Man informed me that the bulk of the crew stayed at Siler Bald Shelter. As it turns out Tracie, Pending and I were the only extra achievers who did not stop there. As we were admiring the stone tower the hiker that slept there mentioned this was his second thru-hike (his first was 1980). I instantly realized he was a blogger called Rainbow Express. I told him I was blogging under the name of Jakethefake and Random (who is sectioning thru the Smokies) immediately said that he was following my blog!Random and I headed down the trail and stopped at a good water source. Rainbow Express came up behind us a shared with us 1980 thru-hike stories as we filled our water bottles.Throughout the day the Siler Bald crew were catching up as Random (who also slept at Siler Bald) and I hiked on and enjoyed good conversation. We stopped at a water source were a small group was gathered to fill bottles and kick it. I met Ghost and Cinderella there and Syracuse Dave showed up. As we hiked away from the steam I took the lead and laying in the trail was a big black snake. It looked to be a Black Racer (not poisonous) and I gave him a gentle nug with my hiking stick and he slithered off the trail. I don't kill snakes, poisonous or not.We hiked on to the Cold Spring Shelter. Many of the Silber Bald hikers were calling it quits for the day. Hula Bear was there and she was on the fence about another 6 miles to the Wesser Bald Shelter. I was unable to convince her. I was glad the Random was ready for the hike as there were very few water sources between shelters and I knew with the big climb at the end I would get to Wesser Bald late.So Hula Bear asked me to tell everyone she would haul ass in the am and catch up for the NOC, then Random and I lit out.The hike took us way down into Telico Gap and then a big elevation climb up to Wesser Bsld. I had to make a call at the bottom of Telico Gap so Random continued on.The climb up to Wesser Bald was tough. If it was a week early it would have made some hikers quit, but I plowed through. At the top of the mountain was a fire tower and much to my surprise Magic Man and Pending were having ""date night"" at the top (cooking dinner). They saw me a called me up to see the view.The view at the top of the fire tower was amazing. As we took pictures and chatted we heard others climbing the stairs and Feel Good and Trek the Savage Rabi made the scene.We left Magic Man and Pending and ""date night"" and headed down the last mile to the Wesser Bald Shelter. On the way down I got to know Trek a little better.Arriving at the Wesser Bald after a 13.4 mile hike my bones were beat. Tracie, Shawn, Trek and I are sharing the shelter. Others are here in tents including Feel Good, Frolic, Lee, Random and a few others.I am glad I pushed it as the hike to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) will be a breeze in the morning where we will celebrate with food and spirits.","Mile 118 campsite

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528985,"4/20 -Day FourteenMy shelter mates and I slept until 8:15. Tracie immediately reported mice activity during the night. My pack was hanging from a nail pounded into a shelter rafter.... And I left a small bag of chocolate in the inside pocket.Evidently the mice smelt the chocolate and breached the pocket of my pack by nawing their way through. And to add insult to injury, the blue brick (which was hanging by a rope in the shelter)somehow took a small naw hole.As I packed for our hike down to the NOC, I dreamt of that Black Racer Snake getting the ultimate revenge on the shelter vermin. And people wonder why I have a truce with snakes? The good news is at Damascus Trail Days all the gear company's offer repairs. In the mean time the mouse hole will be patched with good old duct-tape.I hiked the 6 miles to the NOC with Brooklyn Shawn. As we hiked I got to known Shawn better. Shawn is on his second attempt for a thru-hike having gone 580 miles last year.The hike to NOC was all down and in some places light scrambling. NOC is in a valley and we have to climb out 3,000 feet tomorrow!We discussed night hiking out. However, the NOC is cool and we were immediately caught in the vortex. I knew right away I was staying the night. We ate lunch at the restaurant on the river and then decided to soak our feet in the river... Where a hiker hang-out party commenced as more and more of our crew filtered into the NOC.As we chilled by the river I sorted through my stuff and built a small ""to be sent home"" box. I also grabbed two packages from the NOC. One package was from my friend Keith and included jerky, slim kind and things. The other package came to the NOC later in the day and was from Amazon. Kelly has sent my an Anker 5200 battery pack for my phone.My friend Keith sent me beads and rawhide and I made a necklace with 14 beads (one for each state on the AT). I will remove a bead after each state do I immediately pitched one (Georgia). As we kicked it by the river I spent time with Dave (The Judge). He is a few years older than me and is a retired NY State Trooper.I also met and talked with Mayfly. Mayfly is a big fly fisherman and is carrying a fly-rod. He intends to catch a trout in every state. We agreed to fish some as I intend to have Kelly send out my fly-rod further up the trail.In the morning we take on the big climb. The climb out of the NOC. They say this climb separates the hikers from the non-hikers. I am culling as much extra weight as possible. It is 7 miles long and the elevation goes up 3,000 feet.","Weseer Bald

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529143,"4/21 - Day FifteenThe horror. Today was the day to climb out of the NOC. The climb to hell has been talked about in hushed tones ever since Blood Mountain. Evidently this was going to be a real workout. It was. I started the day easy enough in the bunk room at the NOC with Shawn, Tracie and Feel Good. Feel Good had to stay with us when at the end of the day at the river he discovered someone stole his shoes. Whatever you do, take care of your shoes! A big group of hikers were eating breakfast at the NOC restaurant. I joined them. Everyone seemed to have different plans. Hula Bear's boyfriend was coming to see her so she was zeroing. Shawn was zeroing to hang out with Alex (trail romance anyone?) and another bunch was planning on a whitewater rafting trip. So as it turns out I was hiking out alone.I ate and prepared a small package of extra weight to be shipped home .... It's amazing what gets culled. Afterwards i headed for the climb.I saw relatively few hikers on the way up. In fact I met more people coming southbound. About a mile in I met an older gentlemen who said the only water available was 2/3 up to the first shelter (4.5 miles) so I immediately went into water conservation mode. The climb to the Sassafras Gap Shelter was 7 miles and the climb was 3,000 feet. The cruel part being there was some flat sections so to make up for this some of the climbs were steep. The hike was never ending.I reached the water 2/3 up and replenished (I had not run out, but the cool spring water was refreshing). There I finally started to see other hikers.The last 2 miles or so to Sassafras Gap Shelter were a new kind hard. It seems that in this part the good folks who carved the AT into the mountain decided that switchbacks made it too easy for hikers. If this hike was on the 2nd or 3rd day from Springer, 50% of all hikers would quit before Neels Gap. As I was fighting one of the straight up-hill battles a fast moving southbounder passed me and said something like.. Be positive at least the sun is not out. I found out later that this hiker was The Real Hiking Viking and he was days away from completing the first ever winter southbound thru-hike. Supposedly he started in Maine in December.I made it to Sassafras Gap Shelter. As I got there the weather changed to windy. I was beat, but it was way early. I took all things into consideration...rain, more hard miles ahead, physical limitations and decided to hunker down here.The vibes were odd a sat first I knew none of the hikers here. I met Peril (who I saw yesterday briefly) and I met Scoutmaster. More and more hikers came in including Salami and Dirty Bowl (both who have recently completed thru-hikes on the PCT). These cats are ultra-liters and cover miles.I was glad to see Trek and Feel Good come in. They are the only two hikers of my crew that are here. Seems like everyone is very tired and it's a very quiet night at the Sassafras Gap Shelter.One cool thing I saw today was the memorial to Wade Sutton. Wade was a Forest Service Firefighter who died in the mountain on Dec 7, 1968 battling a forest fire. I stopped a minute and paid my respects. I thought a quiet moment was better than laying a coin or some other junk on the memorial like so many people did, but I guess that is how some people acknowledge sacrifice.On a sad note I just received a text from Dave The Judge. We hung out at the river yesterday. I liked Dave as we were close in age and he is a good guy. Unfortunately he got off the trail today after a brutal hike. I suggested he zero and think it over. Tomorrow I hike over Jacob's Ladder. I am told its part hiking and part rock climbing. I can't wait!As I finish this update it is 8:30 pm am some wicked shit just blew in. It's windy and raining like mad. The decision to hunker down paid off.","The NOC

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529364,"4/22 -Day SixteenAfter I posted last night the storm broke wide open. It felt good to be dry in the shelter even if I was sleeping next to a girl named Dirty Bowl. In the morning the usual sunrise scramble went down as. Salami and Dirty Bowl were out early. Everyone was prepping for a wet walk although it was not raining when we all first started stirring. Unlike some folks, I like to piddle in the morning. Today my piddling scored me a hot cup of coffee/moca from Trek. As I was drinking it Tracie walked in.... Evidently she started hiking at 6 am from the NOC. She looked fairly tired and wet. I said my goodbyes to Trek, Tracie and Feel Good and headed out. Unlike all the other hikers I did not leave with my rain gear on. About 5 minutes into the hike it started drizzling. First I put my backpack cover on, then my rain jacket. I reached a small bald and finally broke out my rain pants as it was now a full on turd floater. The Cheoah Bald is supposed to have a great view. Today the view consisted of a wall of gray fog obscured in rain. I did not stay there long, as standing still meant to be cold because it was a little windy up there. The descents after Cheoah Bald (and all other descents today) were treacherous. They say no rain, no pain, no Maine, I got both today. They also say you will fall at least once. I got my fall in today. It was not a fall as much as it was a slide. However my ass did touch turf for a second so it's a fall. Damn those flat and slick rocks.I walked in the pouring rain and then it stopped for a while. I then realized I have not seen anyone yet today hiking. This kinda thought will immediately throw you. Into panic and start searching for the next white blaze. No, I was not lost and soon I saw both a white blaze and a dude named Farmer Luke come hiking by. Farmer Luke carried a light pack and was wearing Choco sandals (no sox). He was as wet as a dog and did not seem to care.I caught up with Farmer Luke at Stecoah Gap. There they have picnic tables and a busy road. Someone left a pile of apples and bananas. I ate an apple. As I was eating a man stopped by with some waters. I also did something new today. I broke out my stove and made a hot lunch. I first ate a pack of tuna flavored with hot sauce and then some four cheese instant patatoes that I have packed since Hiawassee! I spoke with Luke and got to know him a little. Then his hiking friends Jack (from London) and Jules (a 65 year old lady that lives of the grid in Northern California came off the trail. I was just leaving so we all kind of followed each other. The climb next was Jacob's Ladder. It was billed as a steep SOB!Luke and Jack went ahead. I followed Jules up Jacobs Ladder. Her pace was like mine. The difference was she did not stop. Jacob's Ladder was steep, but I expected something like you see on the package of Cliff Bars. That it wasn't . But before I knew it I was descending and seeing the sign for Brown Fork Gap Shelter ....my goal for the day. And it is a good thing I was stopping there as there was lightning starting to rumble in the not so distance. I hiked fast to the shelter. There was one person in the shelter.... Jack from London. We said hello and then the bottom dropped out and it really began to rain.Jack and I were discussing how odd it was that on a rainy night only two people were in a shelter! That's when the wet rat brigade started to appear.... Ghost, Ranger, Holy Diver, Sundown, Mayfly, Trek and Feel Good. Every one of them was soaked to the bonesWe made makeshift clothes hangers and ate and had a great time talking about the day. Most of those guys were the ones who white water rafting at the NOC and Mayfly went fly fishing (and caught some fine trout!)The shelter is stuffed tonight. For the first time in my hike there are no woman at the shelter (Tracie was picked up by Odie on the bus at Stecoah gap). With no woman the guys were free to be guys and we had some good laughs. We hike into Fontana tomorrow.","Sassafras Gap Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529522,"4/23 - Day SeventeenThe plan today was to hike the 13 miles to Fontana Dam, get a room, rest and get ready to resupply and do laundry. No one wants to zero here... Most are moving out mid-day on Sunday. Me included. I hiked with Mayfly and brothers Holy Diver and Ghost for most of the day. We also hiked with Ranger who moved slow today due to shin-splints.The hike was not brutal until we reached the decent to Fontana Dam. We could see the dam very far away and it seemed like we were right there, but the trail went in and in running ridge-lines and descending on a trail covered with rocks and roots. When I finally reached the bottom Holy Diver, Ghost and Mayfly were there (they were a few minutes ahead of me). We decided to walk 1.5 miles to the Fontana Dam Visitor Center. There we would call the shuttle to the Fontana Lodge. We were lucky to get a room because both car and motorcycle clubs have the place booked.At the end of the last 1.5 miles we reached the infamous Fontana Hilton Shelter. The Hilton is a shelter everyone talks about. It was well built and in s cool spot, but since we already booked a room we said hello to Scoutmaster who was sleeping there and kept walking.I was very beat. My food supply was low (which made my pack light) but I was low on energy. Early in the day we found some apples and bananas at a road crossing and I ate a banana (probabally the first one in 40 years) and and apple. They were both great.Despite the mid-day break my tank was on empty. We were trying to hump it to the general store before it closed at 6 and we had a mile to go when we walked up on trail magic.In this case it was a dude named Wildcat who did a thru-hike in 2015. He had it all! Hot dogs, chips, Gatorade, soft drinks, cookies. We immediately abandoned the run to the general store and feasted with Wildcat.Just when you thought it could not get any better, he offered some good resupply stuff like Ramon and Knorr's pasta sides to us. It was a very kind thing. Wildcat is a good mellow dude.As we were finishing our feast Odie and Tracie pulled up in the AT Yearbook Bus and into the nearby parking lot. Odie offered to take us to the Fontana Lodge in the bus so we all piled in! We would later return the favor by offering Odie and Tracie a place to park the bus and whatever they needed from our cabin. As it turned out, trail angel Wildcat was staying in a cabin across from us so a little hiker get together happened. Note... Hiker get together are not raucous events after a 13 mile hikes. We were all pretty spent. I start hiking in the Great Smokey Mountain National Park tomorrow!","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529782,"4/24 - Day EighteenWe woke up early and went to the Fontana Lodge buffet breakfast. Ghost, Holy Diver (who we discovered are brothers!), Mayfly and I participated. After breakfast we went back to the cabin and started sorting through all of our food trying to build five days worth (you can leave Smokies and resupply in Gatlinburg, but I would rather die from a rouge bear than to not hike straight thru).What holes we had in our 5 day supply we quickly filled at the general store (which was surprisingly well stocked for hikers). Both Mayfly and I recieved resupply boxes so we did not have to buy much. We also did laundry at the general store's laundromat. By noon (one hour after check out) we were ready to hike. Our packs were scary heavy with the weight of a lot of food.Odie and Tracie left in the bus, so we got the shuttle driver to drop us off at the visitor center on the Fontana Dam. I went inside and learned a little history from the hosts, but my mind was in the climb and the heat of the afternoon sun.""The brothers"" went out ahead of us. We knew that with our weight there was no way to keep up with them. They were resupplying in Gatlinburg and therefore were not loaded down. Ranger was there, but was not going forward now, his shin-splints were taking him back to Franklin for a few days of zeros (I assume at Gooder Grove). We will see him again. Mayfly and I fought the good fight as we entered the Smokies. The climb was all up hill, but not too steep. Regardless, the weight of are freshly supplied packs and the afternoon sun made it hell.We hiked to Birch Creek Gap (the first campsite in the Smokies). Carl the Ridgerunner welcomed us in and pointed out a tent pad site. We settled in and joined the others (two new thru-hikers named Cowboy and Mozy). We built a fire and ate as much food as possible. We have to lighten out load as we are going 12 miles in the morning.Around the campfire was a group of section hiker girls from Florida and a very quiet girl that hung by the fire and did not say much. Midway through the short evening I learned this quiet girl was Special K. Special K is 14 years old and is attempting the youngest solo thru-hike ever!!!! I thought it was an honor to share a fire with her and told her so. Reception here in the Smokies is iffy. If I go dark for a day, don't panic. It's all good.","Fontana Dam

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529859,"4/25 - Day NineteenI felt good today, day two of my trek through the Smokey Mountains National Park. I hiked a total of 11 miles and felt good. All day I hiked with Mayfly and finished the day off with Special K and Mayfly.I thought the miles were easier today and today is the first day my feet did not hurt at the end.Although I felt good today, I played an AT hikers favorite game.... What am I going to send home to lighten my load?It seems at the beginning of the AT everyone talks about ""after the smokies""... As in ""after the Smokies I will pick up miles per day"" or ""after the Smokeys I will send my winter gear home."" It seems at first as this is years away, but here I am days away from being out of the Smokies!!!I plan to do both so as I hiked I made a list of things to shed here in about five days which include:Lite long john bottoms (nylon)Lite long john tops (nylon)Gloves (have put them on ONCE)Rain pants (it has always been my plan to scuttle these after the Smokies. I have used them ONCE But I was glad I had them when I did). I intend to look at rain ""kilts"" at Trail Days in a few weeks. Ya I said it, a rain kilt.Columbia fleece pullover ( I am wearing it now as I type this, but my Patagonia jacket and my Merino Wool mid-weight will be sufficient.Also very soon I will be switching to running like shorts (I have a pair with me, but I will get another). I will send home my Kuhl zip off pants... They are growing to big for my shrinking body.I may send home one pair of sox and my long sleeve REI shirt, but the jury is out on that.The game is to shed as much weight as possible. I am no where's near over packed, so every shed ounce makes me lighter. I want to get into the big mile game and summer is coming. Today I also discovered a tear on my load strap on my pack-back. Pretty lame Gregory, no wonder Osprey and ULA has kicked your ass on the trail....185 miles and you pack is falling apart. I may be shopping for a new pack at trail days. Sucks, the Gregory actually feels good on me. I am still waiting to see a bear. One hiker at the last shelter caught one on her video and I saw a great track right by the shelter spot I am tenting at now. One section hiker saw two lower today on a trail other than the AT. I am waiting to see a hog! We walked through miles of fresh rootings today (rootings are where hogs root up earth looking for worms, grubs and acorns). The Smokies have a rooter problem!!!Tonight I am tenting at the Spence Field Shelter. There were spots in the shelter, but a loud mouth girl turned me off to the thought of sleeping in there, plus no rain is in the forecast. It's weird, I am seeing new faces a lot and there are several section hikers in the Smokies. Right now my group of a few days ago are spread out. I understand both Feel Good and Magic Man are having knee issues. Some folks are behind me and some are ahead. It's really bizarre how things get shifted around out here.Mayfly and I are going for 13.5 miles tomorrow. We want to get through Smokies in 5 to 6 days. Because you must stay at a shelter (versus stealth camp) one's hike is somewhat dictated by the shelter locations. My mind and my body are ready for a good long hike in the am.","Birch Creek Gap Campsite

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530034,"4/26 - Day Twenty""Tennessee, Tennessee, there ain't no place I'd rather be"". Man, I have waited a long time to toss the quote out, but here I am, in TN! We'll sort of... The AT skirts the NC and TN border here in the Smokies so it was back and forth all day!I guess because the AT runs the border the people who built the trail decided to run it straight up and down along the border. To hell with switchbacks.This lack of switchbacks creates very bad erosion in many places and exposes rocks and roots. In many parts the AT today resembled a dry creek bed. It's ugly and it made the walking extreme. Where yesterday I felt I beat the mountain, today the mountain won. My feet and legs are hurting. To make it worse, we stopped at 11 miles and did not press on to 13.5. This pretty much sealed our fate. We have to go into Gatlinburg to resupply. Rain is expected tomorrow. We are going to try to get to the gap and figure out a ride.Not everyone felt today was a crap-out, but the shelter is very quiet. Two new characters have made their way into my journey. I will tell you about them now. The AT is like that. When one character moves ahead, another one comes up from behind. Mozy. Now here is a cat I admire and respect. I met him two days ago at Birch Creek Gap Campsite. To say this character is unassuming would be an under-statement. His name is perfect as he just mozys along like the Smokies is his personal neighborhood park. He is the poster child for the phrase ""hike your own hike"" and does it with a crooked stick he picked up at the entrance to the park.... who needs trekking poles anyways? The thing is the guy makes miles and does it in a style that leaves him clean looking and slightly less disheveled than a guy who decides not to shave this weekend. On the other hand, I feel like I look (and smell) like the ""1 for $3, 2 for $5 veggie burrito salesman standing in the parking lot of any jamband show. To look at Mozy one would think, damn how did you get here, but as I said, he hikes my ass off. And speaking of hiking your own hike, Justin caught up with me today. Justin is a hiker who I met in Houston a few weeks before I started. He had previously hiked from Springer to the NOC after he got back from Iraq with the Marines. When he said he would like to do more hiking on the AT I said come on. Well.. Justin is here. But here is where it gets good...Whereas most people are out here with the goal of Maine in mind, Justin is out for a walk in the woods, regardless if the means carrying a few extra props. I have been asking hikers if the saw him (Mayfly and I where a day ahead of him). I asked Chicken Little at lunch today if he saw him and his response was something like this... You mean that crazy fucker with roller skates? About then here comes my boy Justin and what appeared to be a 70 pound backpack version of Carrot Top's box of shit.... Including a pair of roller blades or as Justin described them as, ""his 6 pound experiment"" (hey man, he skated across Fontana Dam in them!) 6 pound experiment??? Shit, I thought I was getting edgy carrying an extra Tshirt and a tiny flask of bourbon... This guy is carrying roller skates (they were a great deal at Target, or so he said).Other objects of, well, utter uselessness included a sling-shot, SOG hatchet and for whatever reason a can of WD40??? The backpack shakedown people at Neels Gap would have had a field day and Sir Packs A lot at the TOG Hostel would have busted a blood vessel. But it doesn't matter to Justin, he is here for the experience and I am glad he made it.So back to the hike. It was brutal. It sucked for Mayfly, it sucked for Special K and it sucked for me. At one point we lost Special K. When Mayfly and I sat on a log to access the bright idea of attempting to hike the Smokies she came up and reported seeing a turkey.. A gobbler at that!!! In fact everyone has seen turkey except me!!! So far I have seen one Chipmunk and 2 deer! I am having fun despite a tough day hiking. Of relevance to report, at some point today I completed mile 185 which puts this journey under 2,000 miles to go. I fought for every mile today.","Spence Field Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530195,"5/27 - Day Twenty-OneWhereas the hike yesterday beat me like a drum, I won back the title of king of mountain today. Weirdly enough today's hike took us to the top of Clingman's Done, the highest point in the entire AT. After yesterday's ass spanking I was ready to battle a steep ascent to reach ""the Dome"". But a brutal hike it was not, the elevation gain was significant, but spread out over several miles of good trail.As we climbed the trail, the forest changed from hardwood ridges to pines. The forest around Clingman's was all pine and covered in green moss.As we reached to peak we were greeted by humanity in the form of human tourists, baby strollers and all! The Clingman's Dome observation space ship looking thing sits at the top and there is a road for those not up for the hike.So my crew (Mayfly, Special K, Justin, Mozy, Chicken Little and Maryland Mark) hung out for a while at the base and basked in the glory of looking dirty and smelling like hikers who camped out four days in the woods. Then the questions started.... Where are you going? How far have you come? How long since your last shower? But it was cool interacting and answering the questions.A nice lady who worked at the gift shop came and sat with us (it was her lunch break) and offered me a Coke Zero (small can). I accepted and drank it in one gulp. Then a nice couple from Michigan, having asked numerous questions, felt generous enough to give me a banana, a buck stick and a piece of string cheese. But all great parties must end and we still had over 7 miles to hike before Newfound Gap where we figured we could hitch into Gatlinburg to resupply and sleep.Like the ascent to Clingman's, the trail down was not too bad. Justin and Chicken Little decided they had enough and would hitch to Gatlinburg from the parking lot of the Dome, so only Mayfly, Special K, Mozy, Maryland Mark and myself played on.The 7 miles took the remainder of the day. I hiked with both Mozy and Mark at times and got to know them better. I discovered a major secret behind Mozy's secret of mountain cruising.... He is only 25!!! When I reached Newfound Gap with Mozy we were greeted by a Styro-Foam cooler with the words ""trail magic"" scribbled on it. This typically is a bummer because these type of trail magic coolers are often empty, but luck was on our side today. Looking in the cooler we found ice cold Coca-Cola's!!!As we cracked ice cold Cokes I saw Mayfly chatting with a lady who turned out to be Special K's mom. As we waited for Special K to bring up the rear I went over where a bunch of people were and they were watching a black bear family down in a valley right off the parking lot. I had just walked 40 miles in the back country... And wanted to see a wild bear. It would take seeing one at a parking lot!So Mozy, Mayfly and I hitched a ride with a nice couple to Gatlinburg (yes people still pick up hitch hikers). The plan here is to get up and get out. Don't get me wrong, Gatlinburg seems like a nice place, but it's better suited for guys like Chicken Little who was very impressed that the steak house served him a hamburger ""the size of his face"". Now you know why we are heading back to the woods early.Other news to report, today I hit mile 200... Actually I have walked 207 so far. On the wildlife observation side, I am hexed. The word is out that I have a turkey call and so is the accurate rumour that I have yet to see a turkey! I am starting to receive text pictures of gobblers as everyone else has seen a turkey! So tomorrow is a 10 mile day unless the forecasted storm washes us out.","Silbers Bald Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530532,"4/28 - Day Twenty OneWe rolled out of bed early and discovered the calls for rain were unfounded, which means we would do a quick supply and get to the trail heady on the 10 am shuttle from the NOC.The NOC is basically and outdoor store like REI. There is one in Gatlinburg and they run a free hiker shuttle as Gatlinburg is 15 miles from the heady.Mayfly and I went to the world's most expensive general store to resupply. Chicken Little was in there and he was shaking off a bit of a moonshine hangover and resupplying (in that order).Resupplies at this stage of the game are critical ... Hiker hunger has kicked in. In fact Mayfly and I ate last night with Justin and Chicken Little and on the way home we stopped and bought a pizza! Now...we only ate half of the pie. I ate the other half before I showered this morning.Now back to the general store... The trick is calories. Think honey buns with ""ice glazing"". What to these things even exist??? 500 calories in one. I bought four.On the way out we bought egg and ham sandwhiches cooked while we waited. Mayfly and I each bought two. I figured I would eat them on the shuttle.We were lucky to catch the 10 am shuttle...as we snagged seats when Nilla was a no show (evidently there is a list). As it turns out she snagged a ride with a trail angel! Nila, is from Padre Island, TexasOn the shuttle was Frolic and Lee, Day Glow and Heather, another couple (can't recall their names), Chicken Little, Mayfly, Mozy and Me.The shuttle was cramped so I decided to eat at the heady.... and I was happy I did as the local Baptist church has trail magic going on which included about everything I just paid 2x fit in the general store in Gatlinburg. Plus fruit!! I ate two bananas, drank a Mountain Dew and grabbed another heart attic wrapped in plastic (honey bun). With that I stashed my egg sandwhiches in my pack for later.The laugh of the day came as we were about to get on the trail. There is a sign at the heady that says...""Mt. Katadin, Maine 1,796 miles"". We were all taking turns getting our pictures by it when a bus load of tourists came up. One gentlemen looked at the sign and said to us... Wow, do you think anyone has ever really done it? We all laughed and tried to explain that yes... Many people do it every year.With that we bolted. The first shelter was 3 miles. Since hikers have to camp in or by shelters our next choice would be Peck's Corner Shelter (which would make for a 10 mile hike today).Chicken Little planned to hold tight at the first shelter as the free moonshine samples from the day before were ending up costing him. When we got there I convinced him to hike with us to Peck's as Mayfly, Nila, Mozy and myself were marching on (but only after I inhaled one egg sandwhich).Just as we were leaving a big group of very nice hikers came to the shelter. It appeared they were in some type of organized club? They started asking us questions and then starting giving me all their unneeded food (they were heading south to the heady). They gave me string cheese, a Cliff Bar, Apple, Doritoes and breakfast bars. I guess because I was the chatty one I was getting all the loot, but I passed most of it on. I did eat the string cheese and Doritoes.The hike to Peck's was a crap out. Not the hardest walk, but not easy either. We all stopped and took in the view at Charlie's Bunion.We all staggered into Peck's Shelter after 5 pm.... Mayfly, Mozy, Nila and Chicken Little. We were all tired and thirsty! Not much water on this stretch!As we ate Justin strolled in. I had figured he was staying in Gatlinburg to try to sell his skates. As it turns out there were no takers and he still has them (although he ditched the WD 40).At dark Special K strolled in (her mom dropped her off at the heady after we embarked). She said she saw Magic Man but lost him? As we chatted by a small fire Magic Man limbed in. He bought new shoes at the NOC and intended to go 3 miles to the first shelter and break them in. Well... He missed a turn and ended up going a round trip 10 miles down the wrong trail!!! Somehow he ended up at Pecks which (with the detour) made for a 21 mile day on new shoes.He looked tired. I had not seen him in days. I told him it was good to see him and then pointed him to the shelter which still had space.I had no reception last night so I had to post this today. Today's post is exciting... Stay tuned","Newfound Gap/Gatlinburg

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530610,"4/29 - Day Twenty TwoI thought I would talk about trail legs today, but something more exciting happened. A bear encounter!!!!Justin, Mayfly and I hiked out of Peck's this morning early. We wanted to get a leg up as the choices of next shelters were Tri-Knob (5 miles) or Cosby Knob Shelter (13 miles). We were shooting for the 13 mile hike!We decided to take a break at Tri-Knob. There was a good water source and shelters are always fun to stop and see who is there.There was a big group of people. Chicken Little, Nila and several other hikers I did not know. One man I did not know (Rocketman) picked up his backpack and headed out back up the trail. We kicked it for another 25 minutes and then saddled up.As we left the shelter there was Rocketman! He was standing about 100 yards from where the trail met the shelter trail. He had saucer eyes and said.... A bear just chased me!The fact that I was almost done hiking through the Smokies without seeing a bear over took my good senses. I said... Let me go see and I hiked quickly past Justin, Mayfly and Rocketman. I did not have to go far. I ran into the beast standing in the trail right by the shelter sign. So I did the wise thing... Took out my camera and took several pictures!He eventually left the trail and hit a ridge. We would find out later he walked the ridge back to the Shelter and everyone there for a bear show!We made it to Cosby Knob Shelter. There are a ton of people here and most everyone saw at least one bear and a lot of bear loads in the trail.In the morning we will hike the last 10 miles of the Smokeys and make for the Standing Bear Hostel at Davenport Gap.","Peck's Corner Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531004,"4/30 - Day Twenty ThreeWe made it out of the Smokies via Davenport Gap where we were surprised with trail magic. I crushed a cold-cut sandwhich, Mountain Dew and some icees. The trail magic was a great way to end the Smokies!The walk out of the Smokies was mostly down and Justin, Mayfly and I hiked together. To make the walk smoother we Bluetoothed into Mayfly's little speaker that hangs on his backpack and mutually enjoyed some music.As we hiked I thought about trail-legs and thought I would share some thoughts on hiking and trail-legs. Trail-legs are what you get after several weeks of non-stop hiking.... Some put a geographic mark on where an AT hiker finally earns them (after the Smokies is a typical call) and others place a time on it and say it takes a full two months.Chicken Little was asking me about these trail-legs the other day. Specifically when did I think he would get his. I told him I don't know, but I reminded him we were having the conversation as we were climbing a rocky incline without stopping. My point was that something has happened to our stamina since we started at Springer. Here is what I have noticed: I can go further up inclines without stopping to put my heart back in my chest. I also noticed I am much more efficient about my foot placement.Foot placement in the trail is critical. Stepping on roots and rock edges causes foot fatigue and can also result in a rolled ankle. When possible I always step firmly on the ground and I avoid long strides during inclines.Skidding out (when your back foot slides out) sucks energy during recovery. Tripping forward on stobs are even worse.I also have discovered that if I am going to make it to Maine my arms and upper body will have to participate in some of the fun. I bring this half of my body into party by using my hiking sticks to propel myself upwards on inclines from behind and push them forward on steep declines (knee saver move).I am officially out of the Smokies and staying in the Standing Bear Hostel. Like all hostels, the Standing Bear has its own uniqueness to it. I would call the Standing Bear the hillbilly version of Gooder Grove. Don't believe me, try washing your filthy clothes with a wash board and wringer Standing Bear style. Whereas Zen did not seem to care too much for the ""business"" side of the business, Morgan (Standing Bear's ramrod) is all entrepreneur.At the Standing Bear a thirsty hiker can buy a cold can of beer... Morgan hawks the swill from a little barn like structure that doubles as the mail drop room. You can get any flavor of beer you like as long as it's PBR ($2.00 a can) or if you feel like living large Budweiser ($2.50). CASH!If that's not enough the Standing Beer has its own ""resupply shack"" which was actually well supplied and reasonably price. Here is the best part,it's all on the honor system and hikers write down what that bought and square up later with Morgan.I came out of the Smokies with some food and received a box from my sister (thank you Susan) so I went light on the Standing Bear shopping spree (even though a rain storm trapped me in the resupply hut for an hour. If you hike the AT, make the Standing Bear a stop. It's places like this that give me confidence there are still some incredibly cool places left in the world.Out next goal is Hot Springs, NC which is 30 miles north. I am going to bed in a cabin. I was glad I sprung for the extra $5 bucks and snagged a lift position.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531005,"5/1 - Day Twenty FourLong day of hiking. I am beat from the ups and downs. We left Standing Bear early and hiked all day. In addition to the many steep elevation gains it rained on us good.Our goal was Max Patch .... A big open ""bald"" of grass. There are no trees up there and the AT is marked with stakes in the ground.When I got there Mayfly was with his brother and his brother's wife (Peter and Tracy). They also had their two little boys. Mayfly was going to Asheville for the night and they met him at Max Patch. Much to out surprise they brought a picnic lunch of BBQ (pulled pork). Today was a big day of trail magic. A super nice couple drove up to the first bald we hiked to and presented us with the best spread yet. They were very nice people and talkative.Between the trail magic at the first bald and Mayfly's picnic I ate good today!   In fact, when we arrived at Max Patch there was another couple camping there of which Justin had made quick friends. They learned of our pursuit and offered some food. I thanked them and explained that we were well fed and we'll stocked to get to Hot Springs and declined the offer.So the picnic ended. Mayfly left with his peeps (we will meet him in Hot Springs). Justin and I decided not to camp on the bald, but to finish the 15 miles at the next shelter. We descended from the bald into the woods and found a great campsite on the edge of the lower bald. It has water and it is protected from the wind. It's the coolest campsite of my journey and it fell into our lap just as the sun was setting and out belly's still full from the picnic. What a great way to end May 1st.note ...reception has been poor I just posted two days of journals. Take a look back from yesterday's post. It's a goodie!","Standing Bear Hostel

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531146,"5/2 - Day Twenty FiveToday was a genuine 16 mile day!!! My longest yet. Since Justin and I camp outside of a shelter area, it meant no early risers waking us up. This translated into waking up at 8:30. The plan was to organize our stuff and dry out the wet stuff on the tree and old fence near the campsite. Because of the bald nearby there was a lot of sun light. So we cooked breakfast and pontificated whether or not our cool campsite was used in the Civil War and then we started sorting through out gear. Organization out here is critical.About then Mozy came by. He camped up on the bald with Nila. When you see Mozy hiking you know it's mid-morning. He is not an early bird and today, neither were we.We finally broke camp and started hiking right around...11. Hey, when you have the perfect campsite right on the trail it's tough to get going. But we got going and decided to head to the Deer Park Shelter which is just 3 miles from the town of Hot Springs.Before I discuss the hike, I will share some thoughts on the changing dynamics of the trail. Justin and I sat literally on the trail organizing our gear and only Mozy and one other guy (Wind Walker) came by. After the Smokies there seems to be less hikers still out there. BTW ... Wind Walker is from Alaska and is a 20 mile a day hiker. He is at the Deer Park Shelter tonight.The hike was not super hard today and it was not super easy. There was two big climbs. One that was 750 feet (which quickly descended) and then back up again 1,000 feet. I felt good on both of these climbs.Because we were walking the late shift we knew we would not get to the shelter before 8! With only 4 miles left the blackest and nastiest cloud came over the mountain. I could hear thunder in the not too far distance so I got out my back pack rain cover and rain jacket. I was hiking fast but I knew I could not outrun this cloud. Lightning became intense for a minute (it was close, but I had closer encounters).... But still it had my attention. Then the cloud broke open.Justin and I hiked fast in the rain. The trail turned into a small river and out boots quickly were soaked. We hit the top of the mountain and the wind was howling... Perfect hypothermia weather. We agreed to not stop and hauled ass! We were both soaked head to toe.We finally hiked into the Deer Park Shelter looking like wet rats. It's a small shelter. Mozy and Wind Walker were in there. They made space for us and that is where I am now, in a tiny shelter wedged between Justin and Mozy. It has not stopped raining and I am happy to be in the shelter.","Max Patch

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531276,"5/3 - Day Twenty SixSometimes it all just comes together. Last night when Justin and I reached the shelter and changed into dry clothes we hunkered down for what ended up being non-stop rain all night. But here is the good part, the shelter roof was metal and damn did I sleep good.That being said, getting up and going was tough because most of my stuff was soaking wet. So slipping into wet dirty clothes was not fun.... But the good part was we were just 3 miles from Hot Springs. Another cool surprise was seeing J in the morning. I had not seen him since Day Two when we hiked together! He was hunkered in his tent when we strolled in.Hot Springs is a deluxe trail town. The AT actually runs through Main Street! To make it better, there is a kick ass breakfast place and the first thing we did was crush a Smokey Mountain Breakfast: 3 eggs, hash browns, country ham and biscuits and gravy. Of course I pounded a gallon of coffee and a shot of OJ. It was so good it made me forget my boots were water logged. About half way through the gang started showing up, in force!!!! First Odie and Tracie show up with the bus. Then Feel Good appeared and then Hula Bear and Kia Bear! We decided to go see what was happening at the Laughing Heart Hostel and that's where we found the rest of the crew....Foxtrot, Pending, Magic Man, Ghost, Holy Diver, Lee and Frolic. It was like everyone I met so far on AT was there!My number one priority was to dry out my boots and pack and do laundry. The second priority was pick up a box from the outfitters. A very generous follower of this blog who was kind enough to send a care package and nailed it as far as what I could use out here. While I was picking up my box I bumped into Alister who agreed to join me for a pint across the street at Spring Creek Tavern.Well as it turns out, the entire crew had migrated there, including everyone that was and was not staying at Laughing Heart. In addition to everyone I already met, there was Nila, Mozy, J, Orange Crush, Heather, Rock, JT, chicken Little. Several pints were consumed.When we got back to hostel I realized Jules was working and helping at hostel. I last saw her at Jacob's Ladder. Farmer Luke is here too. Both Jules and Luke are resting after doing too many miles.Today was great. It started with me being wet (not wet and miserable), just wet. I hiked 3 miles and had a great breakfast, received a great box and had several beers with friends. In the morning I will finish up packing winter clothes I am sending home (Kelly get ready for mail). I hope this lightens my load. I did buy a great pair of Columbia shorts to replace my zip off shorts and I found a really cool shirt in the ""free"" rack at the hostel... But overall I am sending home 2 plus pounds of clothes!I am going to keep my miles under 15 for now. I keep catching the fast hikers on their multiple zeros when they have to rest.","Deer Park Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531875,"5/4 - Day ThirtyNote. I had my days on the trail wrong all alone? Today is the one month (30 days) on the AT. After 30 days I am at 284.7 (Spring Mountain Shelter). This breaks down to 9.49 miles average a day or 10.17 not counting the two zeros I have taken (Neels Gap and Franklin). I would have liked to hit 300 miles, but at the same time I am happy how my knees are holding up. I will make bigger miles in VA.The day started at the Laughing Heart Hostel where I sorted into a big pile what I intended to send home (cold weather stuff). When I stepped out of the hostel... It felt cool (go figure).Me an Hula Bear went to the post office. She was sending extra cold weather stuff home also. As I boxed my stuff up I noticed everyone coming in (locals) with cold weather jackets. Great! Just as the tape hit my box I snatched my ""extra"" long john tops and bottoms from the box. Thank god, this would prove to be a good move.After lunch and resupply Justin, Mayfly (back from the visit to his brothers in Asheville) and I crossed the French Broad River bridge and headed out of town.We were sluggish. We stopped on a bluff about a 1/2 mile up. We had to go 11 miles today (camping is not allowed where the big fire just occurred). As we did Foxtrot came cruising by. As it turns out she would be the only other hiker I would see all day.Justin pulled out ahead and Mayfly, really sluggish from his Asheville ""vacation"", fell behind me. I would walk through the burned area alone all day.Today's walk was bitter-sweat. The hike covered some easy ground, some rough ground and some interesting ground. It even passed a pond and old hay fields now used for grouse and turkey nesting.b in some parts the AT followed gravel roads and I had to keep my wits sharp to make sure I followed the white blazes. I also reflected on the fire that hit our farm last October and studied what the fire did to the trees here on the AT. I was happy to see that for the most part the fire stayed on the ground and was relatively ""cold"". In some places it looked like the results of a a good prescribed Fire. However, in the ravines and gullys it appeared the fire came in hot.I was glad to finally cross over back into the unburned area as the burns after awhile kind of brought me down. When I did get to the end of the fire area, I crossed a dirt road and there see two National Forest lawmen staking out the trail head. I stopped and we chatted about turkey hunting. I was carrying my call in my mouth and I played it for them. They were armed to the teeth with teasers, pistols, flashlights and other implements of destructions and said they were there making sure no one went up the road because it washed out. I am pretty sure they were looking for someone on the AT as they were parked strategically where the trail crossed and hikers could not see them until they stepped out onto the road. Who knows? They were nice and we talked turkey hunting until Mayfly came up.It was getting dark and we had 1.7 miles to go, so I said goodbye and we hauled ass to the campsite and arrived as it started to rain and get real cold!The first thing I did was set my tent up and the second thing was put the very same long johns on that almost went home earlier in the day. I am now in my tent and it is pouring and the wind is roaring. It's going to be a long cold wet night!!!","Hot Springs

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531878,"5/5 Day Thirty OneMy journal entry last night was cut short. The wind really was blowing and the rain was pelting hard. The rain continued all night until it turned into sleet and snow. To say it got cold outside is an understatement.The worst part was I had to set up my tent quick and I was in a slight slope. A slight slope really sucks as you will slide to one side of the tent as the night progresses.But sliding to one side of my tent was the least of my problems. The rain was coming down hard and I received a text from Justin he stopped at a firetower so now I was worried about him. But not too worried that I fell asleep and woke up to an ice and sleet covered tent. Warning, shameless gear plug coming up....my Henry Shires Double Rainbow TarpTent held up very nice and I woke warm and dry. I would recommend this tent to anyone not wanting to freeze to death.Now back to out program. It was cold in the morning. You know that wet cold that cuts through whatever you had not sent home? Yup.. That kind of cold. When I finally emerged out of my ice encrusted tent some tenters were already gone. The shelter dwellers were still nestled in and I discovered that the brothers (Holy Diver and Ghost) were deep inside trying to stay warm with whatever they each carried in their ultra light rucksacks. The Rock was there two, but he was moving out with his loaded down military backpack that makes one wonder if he is carrying ""the doomsday device"" in there. Mayfly and I used the vacated shelter to organize our stuff. We moved slow. At some point we heard there was shelter about 7 miles up the trail and the weather was going to get WORSE. We decided to go for the hostel.Mayfly and I trudged through a very slick and muddy 7 miles and finally to Hemlock Hollow Inn Hostel. As we walked we asked all southbounders to look out for Justin and to please tell him we would be at the hostel.When we got to the hostel it started to rain. The deluge reinforced our decision to take a short day and seek cover. Plus to sweeten the deal, there was trout stream on the property.We were concerned that the place would be booked, but when we walked in there was only Rock and J. So we each bought a bed in the bunk room and sorted through our wet gear.All day I was worried about Justin and kept thinking they would find him at the fire tower looking like Jack Nicolson at the end of The Shining.At 6pm James (the hostel ramrod) ran us to the local beer/pizza/cigarette store for dinner. Here we were able to buy dinner and observe some of the ""local flavor"". As we shopped Justin called me from the hostel. He was alive. Evidently he spent the cold part of the morning sitting Indian style in some southbounders tent learning how to cook trail fondue in a titanium skillet. Evidently he found a new friend and they plan to meet at Trail Days. Bromance.So we finally made it back to the hostel and despite the continual rains, Mayfly broke out his fly rod and we went to the pool of Paint Creek that ran by the hostel. We took turns casting and we caught some small Rainbow Trout and Creek Chubs. As darkness fell and the rain intensified we retreated back to the cabin where we played cards with Rock, J and Justin until we all went to bed.","Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531881,"5/6 - Day Thirty TwoBig day today. The emotions ran from low (hiking up hill in misty nasty conditions) to high (major trail magic and a beautiful sunny 4 mile walk along a very rocky part of the AT that was fun and offered very good views).Equally as important is I am at Jerry' Shelter which is mile marker 300.8!!!!The lows: we were slow getting out of Hemlock Hostel. The weather look gloomy and we had a 2,000 foot climb ahead of us to start the day. We agreed to do the first 3 miles then break for water at the first shelter.The climb to the first shelter wasn't the hardest and with the muddy trail conditions not the easiest. It just was bit fun gloomy woods). Then two gentlemen passed us and said there was trail magic at Jones Meadow (2 miles above the first shelter).When Rock, Justin, Mayfly and I met at the first shelter we decided to take a very brief break and head for the trail magic. What we did not know was that a nasty climb laid between us and nirvana.The climb sucked... No if, ands or buts. It just sucked. It was steep, the trail was muddy, one second it was drizzling, I sweated, then when I stopped I was cold. You get the point.But then we were there. The Greeneville, NC Hiking and Cycling Club was holding the grand champion trail magic.... Complete with a big tent full of good things to eat. I immediately went for coffee and we all huddled around the warm fire as we were wet and cold from the climb.Them I ate a salad, and then another salad, then a cheeseburger and some mashed potatoes and then more coffee and fire.Plans to do 16 miles today went out the window and we warmed ourselves by the fire for 2 full hours the entire time politely turning down offers to ""take as much as you need"". Thank you Greeneville Hiking and Cycling Club you made our day!!!!Scrubbing plans to go big miles we decided to go 4 more to Jerry's Shelter. Although this shelter has no affiliation to Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead we still pretended it did. Most people that were at trail magic opted for this shelter.The best part of it all was the 4 miles from the trail magic to Jerry's. It was a cool walk (although trail was muddy) that offered some real technical rock scrambling. The sun came out and with full belkys we were happy. We hiked with a guy named Obie-won (Star wars) and got to know him. We are all tented at Jerrys. The sky's have cleared but it will be another very cold night.","Hemlock Hollow Hostel

The hike yesterday included some simple but very well received trail magic.One trail magic that we stumbled on was a bag of miniature turkey sandwhiches individually wrapped. What tossed these little gems over the top was what tasted like home grown garden tomatoes.This act of kindness enabled me to plow on and Mayfly and I camped at a sweet spot just above Spivey Gap.Our campsite enabled us to do a quick 10 miles today and set up shop at Uncle Johny's Hostel here in Erwin, TN. As usual, they're were lots of familiar faces here.We ended up jumping in a shuttle van and at an all you can eat pizza buffet followed by a resupply shopping spree at Walmart.

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532504,"5/10 - Day Thirty SixThe day began with plans to slack-pack out of Uncle Johnny's and get 20 miles behind us. The crowd was big at Uncle Johnny's, but it soon thinned out as hikers left on what seemed like all directions. Before we could get out of there Alister slipped in. We heard he was having s tooth-ache and we found out he had a root canal in Hot Springs!!!Trail Days is this weekend in Damascus and already hikers are trying to get there. I am told hikers start gathering now and ""tent city"" grows until the festival ends thus Sunday.We dilly-dallied too long today and finally decided to get a ride to Hampton, TN from Justin's girlfriend (Carla). The decision was made as this will enable us to hike into Damascus (Trail Days) by the end of the week. We will then go back to Uncle Johnny's after the festival and do the section between Erwin and Hampton. I don't regret the decision, I do regret doing a complete zero today.We are staying 1/2 mile away from the trail head in the Black Bear Resort. This place is nice. It is a campground with cool cabins versus a hiker hostel, but they do accommodate hikers as well. The odd thing is it is not all the crowded... Possibly hikers pushed ahead to Damascus?Mayfly, Justin and I are in a cabin. We saw one other couple and I just saw a friendly familiar face (Farmer Luke) hike in. I last saw Luke in Hot Springs. He is a fast hiker and said he just did a 30 mile day.Doing bigger miles past Erwin becomes possible I am told as the terrain levels out some.... Although we have a big climb out of here in the morning.Here is the crazy thing. We skipped some 70 miles of trail to get here (again... We will do these miles after Trail Days... So don't go to calling me a yellow blazer!), but by car the distance between Erwin and Hampton was 20 minutes!!! That really puts into perspective how to trail winds through the mountain.We are going to push for miles tomorrow. As always, our packs are heavy due to resupply. Although I did not plan to zero today, the rest is good. The only continual bummer is that many of these hostels are located in spots where cell reception is non-existent and I am having problems texting and posting updates.","Uncle Johny's Hostel

Kincora is a well known hostel ran by a well known AT community leader, Bob Peoples. It was an experience bring there, but I wanted to makes miles.Luckily there was a gentlemen named The Old Ridge Runnner there. In fact there were many people there due to Trail Days. Honey (who runs an AT hostel in Maine with her husband Bear) was there and cooked s big pot of spaghetti and meat sauce.The Old Ridge Runner was leaving for Damascus in the morning and he agreed to squeeze me into his Kia and drop me off at a gap outside Damascus so I could get some miles and hike into Trail Days.Mayfly has decided to take a car from the hostel later, but at last minute he decided to squeeze in into the Kia.We stopped for breakfast and we were soon at the heady at the gap.... About 20 miles from Damascus.The Old Ridge Runner offered to take our packs into Damascus so we could slack pack in, but we were not having any of that! We did lighten our packs by letting him carry in our food bags and a few other things.The hike to Damascus was good. The bonus was I ran into several familiar faces near the TN/VA border. Had we not decided to hike today I would have not seen these hikers which included Sundog (a super fast hiker that I last saw in Fontana). We all took pictures of each other at the border sign.I dropped into Damsscus and immediately starred seeing familiar faces... Some hikers who are ahead of me and some who are way behind. The hiker fest starts Friday, but the Baptist Church held a free feed at the DVFD station tonight!I am confident Trail Days will be a very good experience. It's like a music festival except no major bands and everyone knows each other.Sunday I will leave and go back to Erwin to finish the 90 or so miles I had to skip to get here. That won't be fun, but several hikers here are doing the exact same thing.","Trail Days

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533436,"5/15 Day Thirty ?Don't send your winter gear home until after Damascus, that is what all the former hikers say, and for good reason... It's cold!!! Tonight I am about 12 miles out of Erwin, TN at 4,300 feet and I will promise you, it will be in the 30s! But that's not what I want to talk about. I want to wrap up Trail Days.Trail Days in Damascus was a very good experience. The entire concept is sureal as if both the towns of Mayberry and the Footloose town co-hosted a Rainbow Family Gathering (except hikers are generally dirtier than Rainbow folk). Damascus does their best keeping the event PG rated (within town) with exception to Tent City (conveniently located at the edge of town below the baseball fields in the woods). For a measly 5 bucks one has access to Tent City for the run. Damascus may host Trail Days, but the party happens in Tent City.But it's not a free for all! ""Step out of line and the Man will come take you away"". In this case the Man is the Damascus PD. And to show their seriousness (and also to get to once a year wear their ""SWAT like"" tactical gear purchased (I assume) with tax payers dollars), the boys monitor the shenanigans of Tent City almost as if there was a concern ""the hikers"" might revolt if left unwatched. I one point I saw a group of about 10 cops that looked like they just received a tip ISIS set up camp. All kidding aside the town and the cops were very tolerating of the event and within Tent City one could take it to many different levels of wackiness. The hi-light for me was not the hiking gear vendors or the tepid PBRs I drank in Tent City, no. It was the reunion of so many hikers that I have met in the short time as I hiked.It would take too long to mention everyone I saw there as well as new friends I met there. It was really exciting walking around seeing hikers that I may not have seen since my first night hiking (Huckleberry who I met on Day One and have not seen him since) and of course former hiking partner (Giant). Of course I saw Smoke (who also hiked with Giant and I earlier on). There was Trek, Feel Good, Magic Man, Pending, OSHA, Shon, Alex, Foxtrot, Sundog and many others. One surprise (or maybe not as he seem to ""be in it"" for Trail Days) was Ranger who came off his Franklin, TN hiatus to not only do up Trail Days big, but also secure the local source for moonshine.Also there was Squidward, Game of Thrones (GOT), Copper, Pancake, Mogley, Keg Leg, Sassy, Jules, Casey Jones, J, Peril, Hula Bear and her boyfriend (who bailed on his PCT hike to join her). Even Farmer Luke and Easy took a break from there marathon hikes seemed to be enjoying a few beers. I like Luke and Easy and Trail Days was bitter sweet as it is unlikely I will see these young fast moving cats again. There was some no shows including the Ultra Light brothers Ghost and Holy Diver as well as Mozy.One highlight was spotting Special K from a shuttle bus (Tent City to Downtown). I asked the shuttle driver to stop and I got off and gave her a hug. Her mom pulled me aside later on Saturday and told me it meant a lot to Special K that I stopped the bus in the middle of the road to say hi. I also found out she is now a day ahead of us here in TN!   We should catch up with her in a few days.I fm going to bed. Definately a ""full mummy"" night. Full mummy being where my bag is 100% zipped up. A very nice trail angel named Cindi Lauper gave us a ride from Damascus back to Erwin this morning. She was kind enough to buy us our all you can eat buffet at Shoneys (which was actually really good) and then haul our packs up trail so we could ease back into hiking via slack packing. Let's call the 12 miles the post Trail Days get back to the trail hike.It's cold, good night!","Trail Days

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533530,"5/16 - Day Forty TwoLast night was COLD! I slept good, but I was chilly during parts of the night. We stayed up late listening to stories and AT ""inside scoop"" from Jester. Jester is a Triple Crown hiker (which means he has hiked the AT, Continental Divide Trail CDT and PCT). His experience and delivery of stories made it worth staying by the fire an extra hour.So with the cold and the late night we got up at about 8:30 or so. It was still cold, but it was evident that today would be a great day for hiking. Mayfly got the fire going and soon Jester, Cyndi Lauper and everyone else were drinking coffee and telling stories. It was comfortable... Too comfty and we would not get mobilized until 11am.Before we could get hiking we were surprised to see Special K's mom drive up the gravel road and drop off Special K. I thought she was ahead of us, but as it turns out she was right where we were and just getting back on trail after Trail Days.So we finally said our goodbyes to Jester, Cyndi Lauper and Silvester and hit the trail. The hike was not horrible, but there were many ups and downs. In some parts the trail was level. In the afternoon we all started spreading out. At some point I stopped and decided to listen to some music. For whatever reason Styx Grand Illusion popped into my head. Now I have enjoyed that album for a long, long time, but for whatever reason I currently do not ""reach"" for it often. But man, did it work today! Ironically enough I hit shuffle and the first song that played was ""Man in the Wilderness"". I cranked out some very pleasant miles listening to the album.We stopped at the Clyde Smith Shelter at mile marker 368. Special K rolled in and so did Pinky and The Brain (a hiker couple I met at Trail Days). There are a few other folks in tents, Justin, Mayfly, Special K and I grabbed the shelter as rain is forecasted and it was empty. Mayfly and I snagged these unique little individual lofts and I am anticipating a good night of sleep up here.","Beauty Spot (12 miles from Erwin, TN)

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533701,"5/17 - Day Forty ThreeThe day started with rain hitting the roof of the Clyde Smith Shelter. The tenters were slow getting started and we were very happy we chose the shelter. Although we knew it would be a wet day, it's nice to square your things away in a dry shelter before shoving off.I was good with the rain. I was going to put in a big day regardless and I was excited about trying out the rain kilt. Mayfly left the shelter first then Special K and I followed by Justin.It was raining lightly when we left and as typical, I was soon hot. On days like today it is difficult to monitor temperatures. I get sweaty hiking and cold when I stop. The good news was most of the water falling was from the trees... The rain was slacking, but the day would remain misty, all day!Today's hike took us up Roan Mountain. It was a long climb (spread over 5 miles). The change in elevation from Clyde Smith to the Roan Mountain Shelter was over 1,700. The Roan High Knob Shelter sirs at 6,193 feet and is the highest shelter on the entire AT.The climb up was actually fun once I figured out what I needed to wear. On days like today, you just get wet. The rain skirt was nice and I left it on all day. My Marmot rain jacket cones on and off to regulate temps. The climb itself was gradual and I found myself stopping very infrequently. I think I finally have my trai legs.We stopped at Roan High Knob shelter for lunch. I cooked a quick hot Ramen and we admired the shelter (two stories and built like a cabin). The shelter sits in a Hemlock grove that you would never guess is in TN!After lunch the hike took us down along an old road that formally lead people to the Cloud Land motel (The south's version of the Shining hotel). It's long gone but the AT passes an old chimney from either the hotel or a cabin.The trail lead us down and across a paved road and up Jane Bald. Definately a cool spot on the AT. As I left the road I walked with a nice couple out on a day hike (crummy day for it, but...). They asked me a lot of question which I liked answering. Soon Special K caught up to me and we proceeded on up. The views were not perfect, but I was grateful to be out in such beautiful mountains nonetheless. On a side note, right before the road before Jane Bald there were several small box traps on the ground and in trees baited with grain. I wish I knew what they were for. I am assuming some kind of chipmunk research?The second part of the day was great. The hike was interesting and the sun poked out shortly. I quickly latched all my wet close to the outside of my pack to start drying. Dry clothes us a never ending battle.I made it to Overmountain Shelter. This was advertised as a must stay and I agree! It's an old tobacco barn now an AT shelter. Since it will be misty all night, about 12 of us are piled into the cockloft where tobacco was once hung.I hiked about 16 miles today. Overmountain shelter is at mile 384. Tag the 20 mile hike I did into Damascus onto that and I am now over 400 miles on this journey!!! Hell yes!","Clyde Smith Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533948,"5/18 - Day Forty FourThey don't get much better than today (or to say it another way, this is one to remember when a bad day comes along).The day really had three parts - the 10 mile hike from the Overmountain Shelter to the Mountain Harbor Hostel in Roan, TN, the quick resupply and burger-fest in Roan and then the 6 mile hike out that ended at a real cool camp sight along the Elk River.Part One - One by one we rolled out of the tobacco barn. Before leaving I met Storm (who is also blogging on this sight). As I left the shelter entrance I caught Yeti (formally known as Little Joe, but he evidently did some kind of wacky/primal dance around the bonfire at Trail Days that made him appear like a Yeti and...). Well Yeti took the wrong turn out of the shelter this am and was back at ground zero after a 2 mile detour. Don't think this happens only to guys named Yeti, it's easy to do. I left camp with a group of high school seniors that were doing a 50 mile senior trip. They evidently had learned all they could learn in high school and were granted permission to go hike on the AT.... The crew was lead by Adam. I did not get anyone else's name, but they were good kids. I have to be honest, I felt good blowing them away as we hit the first climb. I guess it's official, I have my trail legs.I caught up with Special K. Her shorter strides make her going slightly slower. We hiked over two very high and beautiful balds together followed by Adam and his crew and Flora and Junebug (I think they are sisters?) right behind us. I continue to meet new people including ""The ladies"" (Flora and Junebug), Jackrabbit, Jeffe, Storm, Ompi, etc. The climbs over the balds were not easy! One was about 800 feet and one was 900 feet. Because they are balds you can see the trail snaking its way up the mountain. At first one gets that ""no way in hell is that trail going up there"" feeling, but then you just go with it. The hiking was not easy, but the morning views were well worth it. On top of the second bald Justin was waiting to show me a plaque that stated we were in Houston Ridge. To date, today's morning 10 miles are my favorite on the AT.After that we caught Mayfly and hiked our way down to Highway 19. The hike was all downhill and was taxing (downhills can be brutal). By the time we reached the highway it was 1 pm.Part Two - We walked the short distance down to Mountain Harbor. We all needed some recharges on our phones and Mayfly had a box at the hostel. It was too nice of a day to quit and I let Justin and Mayfly know I was grabbing resupply items and getting back on the trail. They decided to return as well. We agreed to hitch a ride into Roan (a few miles a way) and eat at Bob's Dairy Barn. Now hitching on the AT is a lot easier than anywhere else and we instantly found a character in a convertible Camaro up to cart stinky hikers into town. I believe his name was Bob (I assume unrelated to the Bob at the Dairy Barn, but who really knows?).Entering the Dairy Barn we discovered that for 12 bucks one could nosh on a Holy Cow Burger. Just listening to the list of ingredients that were the kid behind the counter rattled off (I think he worked on a commission) at the made my heart beat irregularly ... Three hamburger parties, 6 strips of bacon, a pile of ham, a scoop of chilly and to top it all off a few O-rings. This thing was a bonafide colon bomb. I was going to play it safe and stick with a pulled pork Sandwhich when I was swayed by fellow hikers Jack Rabbit and Jeffee (who just ravished their own death burgers and were glowing as if overdosing on calories) the colon bomb was the right choice. So I caved in and ordered one. Mayfly also ordered one, but with fries.This creature was mean and it was bound to do me harm. I could feel my arteries hardening as I dove in. Man, this thing made the Baconater from Wendy's seem like a light snack! I don't know if the Dairy Barn sells many of these to non-hikers but I can assure you Mayfly and I did not eat dinner and that was after hiking another 6 miles.So with phones charged and resupply completed at the Mini-Mart we hitched back to the heady. This time a dentist who loved to hiked was kind enough to give us a lift.Part Three - We marched on up the hill and out of the gap into a big rain storm. Although heavy, it would not last long, and we soon found that we were making good miles. We set the goal for the next shelter 8 miles away. We were feeling good and just about an hour before dark we found a great campsite on the Elk River... 2 miles Shy of the 8 miles, but the waters looked ""trout suspicious"" so we thought we would call 16 miles for the day good and test our suspicions in the morning. We also know we can do the miles needed tomorrow to get to where we left off before Trail Days. So we built a fire, pitched our tents and for the first time did not cook at night. The colon bomb is still with me... I bet I don't eat all day tomorrow either. Whether off the trail or on, I am confident there will be shitty days in the future, and when that happens I will hold onto today as this was truly a great day on the AT. I feel I have to once again thank Kelly for holding down the fort and giving me the opportunity to experience this epic day.Now for some clarifications... I met Storm and he was surprised to meet me. He blogs here as well. I have blogged under the name ""jakethefake"" for over a year. I kinda figured I would go by that or ""Jake"" on the trail, but that's not the way the AT works. How it works is someone says... Hey you look like The Dude in the Big Lebowski and, well, it sticks. So out here on the AT I am The Dude. I just wanted to mention that in case anyone else is hiking and reading my blog and wondering who I am. Finally, I have been told there is another The Dude that is no longer on the trail that pulled some dumb-ass moves earlier this year. I am not that The Dude.","Overmountain Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534383,"5/19 - Day Forty FiveWhat can I say about today? Where yesterday was utopia, today had moments from hell. I am happy I banked some positive vibes from the previous hike yesterday. Although today was not bad enough to pull out deposits, it came close. It started with an all night rain soaking and while I stayed dry in the Tarp Tent, everything I was carrying had a wet and slimy feel to it in the morning. Mornings like this are tough to get moving, and then throw in suspicious trout waters, a morning fire, music and, well we did not get rolling to 11 am. We did get some fishing in, Mayfly caught one Rainbow Trout, I spent my morning untangling leader knots and demonstrating being pissed. The terrain ahead of us appeared easy, we set a target for Black Bear Resort (18 miles). What we did not budget for was the muddy trail conditions that laid in wake of recent rains. As I trudged forward I felt like a British Tommy marching forward into the trenches of the Somme preparing to take on the Hun in the knee deep mud. Ironically enough the epic WW1 Battle of the Somme got under way 100 years ago this month (for you history buffs). Speaking of battles, the Holy Cow Burger (Colon Bomb) apparently set up an offensive battle position somewhere in the 12 feet of my coiled intestines. With mud sucking at my feet every step and a battle raging from within, I knew this day was not going to be a cake walk.Yet we trudged on. The woods were far less than exciting as most of the day we were encased In a tunnel of continuous rhododendron, which seemed to help the wetness lock-in and create further mud holes out of what was formally the AT. Despite the crummy conditions,we played a game of ""how far can we get in a hour"" and burned a lot of energy that would be needed later in the day doing so. We range between 2 to 4 miles an hour with packs. We estimated that some of the trail was ""4 mile trail"", but the muck held us to no greater than 3. A lot of hikers wear trail runners. Trail runners to me are sneakers with better soles. I was happy I was wearing my Vasque Breeze hiking boots as I was able to move easy without ""stepping round"" mud holes. By the end of the day my kicks looked like a cake of mud,but my sox and feet were dry. I did however decide it is time to buy gaiters to keep dirt and rocks out of my shoes. About 7 miles left in the day the trail changed and became more of ups and downs. At this point I was alone (as we all spread out) and I started running low on energy. The miles seemed to go on forever and as the day became late, a weird gloominess settled over what seemed to be a mountainous rainforest. To add to the drama,the trail became littered with ""slick as shit"" roots that have been marinating in water for who knows how long. At least once I laid it down on my ass and to make it even more fun, I ran out of water! Running out of water was like a punch in the gut, as earlier in the day we crossed at least 25 streams and even at one point questioned if we were going in a big circle... Cross stream, go up slick rise, go down slippery slope, walk through a muddy section, walk through a rhododendron tunnel and repeat. The last 7 miles were pretty weak in terms of interesting terrain. Equally as weak was my performance, let's just say I made it through to the road of which the Black Bear Resort (hostel) resides on....only the hostel was another half mile before the hike for the day was officially done!The half mile down Dennis Cove Road helped my attitude as the change in scenery was uplifting and a strange peaceful calm came over me. I knew Justin and Mayfly were ahead of me (and would already have s cabin secured). The pleasant surprise for the day was seeing that Trout, Voodoo and Blister (collectively the Apple Dumpling Gang) were hanging at the hostel. We like the Apple Dumpling gang, they are good kids. They were ""no shows"" at Trail Days... The official reason given was they avoided ""the whole mess"" due to ""lack of self control"". The Black Bear is a clean place and the cabins have porches. We spent the evening on the porch enjoying a few beers and getting caught up. Later in the evening J (Tortise) showed up with his girlfriend Sarah. She was toting a large box of cookies which were soon devoured. They were there with J's parents who live in NC. It's always great seeing J and Sarah and seeing them further lifted my spirits. After visiting I took a shower...the shower at the Black Bear was the best shower I had in the AT. The water was actually hot and the fact that I was hosing off 5 days of stink made it that much nicer.Hiking the AT is bizarre in that you never know when you are going to see someone again, if ever.","Elk River Camp

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534404,"5/20 - Day Forty SixAnother good day and a big improvement over yesterday. The day started with me doing laundry. I was carrying a load of wet and dirty laundry that was last washed before Trail Days. It was ripe. As my clothes were washing I squared away my backpack and discussed the days plans with my crew as well as the Apple Dumpling Gang.The decision was made to slack-pack 13 miles from the trail head near Black Bear to Lake Watauga, then from there, walk four more miles to the first shelter and out of the ""closed to camping"" bear area by Lake Watauga. The folks at Black Bear would drop our backs off, this would give us 6 hours, plenty of time to hike and throw a few flies into the water by Laurel Falls. Hostels often have small back packs to use for slack packing, the Black Bear did... Mine was bright lavender! As we were getting into the Black Bear shuttle Justin bailed out and proceeded to throw up everything he recently consumed along with what appeared to be his stomach lining on the Black Bear's lawn. He is down with disease or in this case, possibly norovirous. He stayed at the hostel.So we made it to Laurel Falls and Mayfly and I broke our our fly rods as the Apple Dumpling gang kicked it. Why I like these kids is that they are not afraid to stop and smell the flowers. They may take a little longer to get to Maine, but my money is they get there.We fished for an hour. Mayfly caught one trout. He is a good fly fisherman and seems to catch at least one trout wherever we fish. I was happy with my casting, but ended up with no trout. We finally had to pull ourselves away as we still had a big climb and many miles to make.Slack packing is nice every once and a while as it enables you to make miles without beating up your knees, shoulders and back. One can really haul ass and we did. The hike took us 1,800 feet up and then 1,800 feet down and all around Lake Watauga. With only a mile or so to go the Apple Dumpling Gang, who were just 30 yards ahead of Mayfly and I, ran up on a bear on the AT. It hauled ass so fast we did not see it. They were excited as they did not see any bears in the Smokies.When we got to the pick up spot (or in this case where our packs would be waiting in the shuttle) we decided to dodge a massive rain storm and head back to the Black Bear for one more night and get shuttled back to where we left off in the morning. In addition we wanted to stay close to Justin as we were told he was ""really"" sick and was in a hotel. This plan worked as the rain began as we started back to the Black Bear with stops to a package store and Subway along the way. In Subway I saw Nemo. Nemo is good to see, he always has a good story about how he was almost ready to get off the trail, but manages to claw forward. We all agreed to share a four bed cabin, the challenge was between the Apple Dumpling Gang, Mayfly and myself there were 5 of us. The bed positions would be determined over a game of cards later in ""the Bear Den"". By the time we got to Black Bear it was pouring bad!!! We once again made the right decision as we can hike out dry in the morning. All night we sat in the Bear Den and watched one movie and then broke out cards. The kids did not have a chance, Blister and Voodoo are sharing a bed! The cards were in my favor tonight and I am solo in the bottom bunk in a large mattress. It's still pouring rain, I will sleep good tonight.","Black Bear Resort

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534571,"5/23Update... We hiked to the gap at Highway 91 on Saturday night. It absolutely poured on us and the trail literally turned into a river. We banged out 15 miles on Saturday, the last 4 were closer to swimming. My Vasque boots finally gave up and my feet were soaked, but as wet as it was, that should be expected.Mayfly and I caught a shuttle into Damascus and checked into the Woodchuck Hostel. Since it was 8 at night we changed out of our wet clothes and went right to the Mill for dinner. Much to out surprise we saw Rock and Alastair. It seems as if a major bubble was zeroing in Damascus. We ate and enjoyed multiple beers and marveled at how wet it was in the trail.Sunday we zeroed. After hiking all last week my body needed a break. We went back to the Mill for dinner Sunday night and it was much quieter, however, one surprise was Mozy who just kinda mozied in.I also went to Mt. Rogers Outfitters and bought boot gaiters, I am tired of getting small rocks and dirt in my boots.We are mobilizing today. We plan to walk up the Virginia Creeper Trail and test the trout waters this afternoon after taking care of additional ""in town"" business including sending a box of loot home and researching lighter weight backpacks.","Lake Watauga

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534758,"5/23Extracting ourselves out of the grasp of Damascus post Trail Days was an all out effort. It wasn't that we screwed off, it just we had some things to do (resupply, send things home from post office, answer emails and texts and buy our VA fishing licenses online).The plan was to hike out the Virginia Creeper Trail. The Creeper Trail is an old narrow gauge railroad bed that is used for hiking and biking. Part of it IS the AT and some of it is not. The important point is that it runs along a trout stream. Midday we found ourselves taking hostel bikes and riding first to Food Giant (or whatever it was called) and then into town and to Mt. Rodgers Outfitters. There I bought a pair of Superfeet as my inserts were looking bad for my boots. There we saw that The Apple Dumpling Gang finally rolled into town along with Gaio. I like Gaio. She collects trash on the AT as she hikes as part of an organized group. The joke is she has now picked up TWO of my bandannas that I dropped on the trail. After Mt. Rodgers we decided to peddle on over to have a final Damascus toast at the bar. There we were joined by The Apple Dumpling Gang, Gaio, Bear Bait, Free Fall and at some point Ompi joined us.Finally Mayfly and I broke the through the magnetic force and headed down the Creeper. The plan was to camp a short distance out of town, fly fish and start a real hiking day in the morning. We set up out tents in a designated camp on the Creeper. Justin was there with a few campers that seemed to be fairly well dug in. One was introduced as Beast and claims to be hiker #4 registered this year (Jan 10th). He said he plans to take all 9 months. He also says that hiker #1 finished TODAY. I do not have reception to check now, but i think that would be Slipknot who started Jan 1st and blogs on here. Once we set to tents we went about trying to catch dinner. The water in the rivers is real high and without waders accessing certain pools was impossible (it's too chilly to wet wade at the moment). Mayfly hit first with a trout off of a stonefly. Not to be out done I walked down the Creeper and found a decent pool and landed a trout on a olive wooly booger. I have brought a lot of fish and game into camps, but bringing that one Rainbow Trout back into our camp tonight was pure primal cool. Everyone cheered and the cheering section included the Apple Dumpling Gang who slipped in as we were fishing.I am excited to do some miles tommorow as well as maybe fish.I enjoyed post Trail Days Damascus. Cruising around on shitty hostel bikes was a blast and staying at Woodchuck Hostel was pleasant. Woodchuck is a good guy and he runs a good clean hostel.On a side not a good dude named Mowgli (who was nursing staff infection on his foot) left the trail today. He had an opportunity to do a project in China for a short period. He plans to come back and I look forward to it as he is a good dude.I am now a few miles into VA... Bring on the VA Blues and everything else this huge state has to offer!!","Woodchuck Hostel

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535278,"5/25Mayfly and I camped out where the AT reconnected to the Creeper Trail last night. We tried to fish until dark when the fly hatch was best. We spoke to a nice local who was also fly fishing and he gave us some pointers. We did exactly slat the trout all day, but we did manage to catch a handful and enjoy the Creeper Trail.This morning we woke up and packed our gear quickly, the goal was to walk about 18 miles to Thomas Knob Shelter at mile marker 497.1 (yes I break 500 miles tommorow!). As we were packing Gaio came through and we chatted a while. It seems there is a big bubble out of Damascus with lots of hikers ahead of us and lots behind.We walked down the Creeper Trail and spoke to a nice Forest Service gal who told us if we crossed the river/creek we could join up to the AT with no backtracking. We saw a tent on the other side and saw it was Wallet.... A guy we met at Woodchuck. So we fished the river a moment (I missed a trout) and then we crossed to the AT side. To get across we carried out boots and went barefooted. It was cold and over my knees in places. After fishing a few more minutes and visiting with Wallet we put up the fly rods and picked up hiking.We soon met up with Chejesus and Two Step (a young Wisconsin couple), Haiku (who has quotes tattooed all over his body and is a super cool guy) and Bear Bait (a college grad from Florida). I also met a hiker named Rocksteady today.We hiked with Bear Bait most the morning and early afternoon. She was carrying a folding chair she picked up at the first shelter. The game is for the chair to go all the way to Maine in a relay. Anyone who carries it gets to sign their name on it. She carried it all the way to Thomas Knob Shelter... Then G.O.T. sat in it!!!!We saw some good balds and views tiday. Along the way we met Cake (she was also at Woodchuck). Mayfly, Cake and I did the 4 to 5 ""Hour of Power"" and killed about 3.5 miles. It is fun to see exactly how far you can go in an hour and to push yourself.While we were hiking we met Raven who was SOBO. I want to say he was s section hiker... But I don't know? He recognized me from the blog here. I thanked him for reading my updates.Not longer after that we had our first encounter with VA wild horses. There were several including two colts. One big gray one kept following me and was trying to lick the salt off of my arms and legs. I finally gave in. I basically received a horse tongue shower. The horse kinda nipped at times. When we were ready to go the horse tried to block the trail so I could not leave. Then he went up to Cake. She was not about to be a human salt lick so we shooed the horse away and hiked on.When we arrived at the shelter there was a big group here. Many hikers we saw in the day were now prepping to camp here. Some moved on from the shelter as there were camps up the way. Mayfly and I decided to shelter camp.We all cooked dinner and as we were sitting outside Haiku recited Edgar Allen Poes's ""the Raven"" from memory. I was impressed and it was a great end of a great day. It was not until I was up in the shelter loft when I realized I met a hiker named Raven and out of pure coincidence heard Haiku's recital.","Creeper Trail

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535279,"5/26Big day today! I started the day at Thomas Knob Shelter and finished it off a long 26 miles away at Trimpi Shelter. Yes people, that's not a typo...26 miles. The long haul was made possible by a combination of what I have to assume are my trail legs and easier VA terrain. That's not to say it was a cake walk, but let's just say the ups and downs are not as extreme.The hike took me through the Grayson Highlands and there the group I was with saw more wild horses. The horses were not as aggressive as the prior day, but some did come out of their grazing pasture to let us pet them. Not to far into the Grayson Highlands we crossed the 500 marked if our journey. We knew we made it by the ""500"" scratched in the white blaze on a tree. I hit the 500 mark with Gaio, Free Fall, Rock Steady, Mayfly and Feather.After hitting the 500 we just hiked. Because we started early I knew I was in for at least a 20 miler. Mayfly went ahead and I hiked with Haiku, Bear Bait and Gaio, but by late afternoon I was solo. I like hiking solo in the afternoons. When I hit the spot where I agreed to meet Mayfly I saw an arrow scratched on the ground. I assumed this was Mayfly telling me he went ahead to Trimpi Shelter. It was almost 7:30, I was tired, it would be dark in an hour so I pressed on fast!The shelter was another 2.5 miles away. I was beat and already tripping on rocks and roots. No way did I want to drag this long day into night. I knew if I stayed steady on my pace I could pull in at dark.The last miles of any day always seem long, but racing against a sinking sun and increasing shadows was fun. When the trail took me to the east side of the mountains it seemed almost dark. When I hit the west side I bought some more light! The trail was easy interms of elevation changes, but there were many rocks and roots. The more tired one gets the more ""phantoms"" that reached up and snatch your feet. Nasty trips happen this way. As I walked I took in the very fresh smells of some type of blooming mountain flowers. I was told my senses would be stimulated out here and I guess they are, as these flowers smelt so good. Speaking of smelling good, section hikers always have this ""Tide fresh"" smell that one can smell a long way away.... I bet they smell us coming, but it's not as fresh of an odor!As luck would have it my tired feet carried me to the shelter with just minutes left of light in the day remaining. Mayfly had drawn the arrow I the trail and was there and so was Justin. They had a fire blazing and two couples were hanging out with them... Snores A lot (don't sleep by him in a shelter) and Music Box as well as Vito and Game Warden.I was tired beyond tired. I kicked my shoes off and took my dirty sox off and my feet felt so good! I ate a Mountain House meal, pitched my tent and the day was done!Several people corrected me about my assumptions as to who may have finished on Mt. Katadin the other day. I apologize for making a statement without checking the facts... But man reception out here sucks!!! Please check back a day or two, I am posting multiple updates today, I am in Marion, VA and these people have discover cell reception!","Thomas Knob Shelter
",Trimpi Shelter,"May 26, Thu",26
Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535621,"5/28Friday we hiked from the Trimpi Shelter to the Mt. Rodgers visitor center. The last few miles were done in the pouring rain. I was hiking alone and finally found reception. My neighbor from Houston texted me that she heard it was going to rain up here. From the time I responded ""clear skies here"" via text it only took 10 minutes for the skies to darken and rain to fall.I marathoned it to the visitor center with Mayfly, the last free shuttle to Marion was scheduled to leave at 2:30 and out catching it would mean hauling ass. I came flying out of the trail and up to the visitor center looking like a mad man wearing a rain kilt. There was a group of young school kids at the visitor center and they all were looking at me like I was... Well, really dirty and wearing a kilt. The teacher quickly herded to kids onto the school bus and away from the small group of hikers awaiting the shuttle.The town of Marion is 6 miles from the heady and they will drop you off wherever you want to go. In my case I was up to be overwhelmed so I jumped off at Walmart. Now here is the interesting part of thru-hiking....I have never been to Marion before, but that does not matter, as a hiker you just bump into other hikers. In this case it was Special K's mom (Special K is back a day at the 500 mile marker). Another thing is the locals either love hikers and want to help them or hate them and wants them to get the hell out of town as several people asked me if I needed a ride back to the trail.... Of course this was before I had resupplied.As fate would have it I would end up getting caught in the town vortex and not get out of there until the morning. I basically gave up some ""banked"" miles from the big 26 mile day as the haul from Trimpi to where the shuttle picked me up was only 10 miles. In the morning I was able to catch a ride with two locals i met at McDonald's. Alastair was also lucky enough to get a ride with me and we hit the trail casually hiking and chatting for the first 4 miles.After the first 4 miles Alastair and I became separated and I continued on alone and with a section joker couple for a period (they are doing a good sized chunk, but I can not remember their names).My goal was to punch out 12 miles to the small town of Atkins as I was told there was a place called ""the Barn"" the served good hamburgers. The 12 miles was relatively easy and even carried me through some neat fields and to an old school building the was built in 1894. In the old school was trail magic including cold cokes, celery, toothbrushes, etc.When I finally made it to Atkins I discovered a large group of hikers that got an early start from the Partnership Shelter (located by the Mt. Rodgers visitor center) only to be trapped by the Barn and what appeared to be at least two 12 packs of PBRs. Bear Bait, Gaio, Feather, Free Fall, Haiku, Jack Rabbit, Cake and several others were hanging out and enjoying the beautiful day and the PBRs. They were even kind enough to offer one or three to me. After they left I stayed and crushed a Philly Cheesesteak and then set out to complete my goal of 18 miles. The second part of today's hike was more challenging and the weight of my loaded down back started to feel heavy (having not eaten hardly anything for to the trail magic and the Barn). By 7:45 I made it to the campsite that I am in now. The group that was at the Barn is all here and it's a fairly large group of tents. Because everyone did 18 miles and several spent a portion of the day drinking beer, it was lights out soon after dark.","Marion, VA

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535629,"5/29It was raining when we woke up this morning. The group of hikers that I was tented around were all quiet until Haiku and I started an exchange as we remained hunkered in our tents. The rain delay would mean my hike (and most others) did not start until 9:30 or so. The day was much more challenging, however I was still able to complete 18 miles, but that took until 8 at night. We are all camped at the Chestnut Knob Shelter (at least 35 hikers as out bubble merged with another today). Everyone wanted to do more miles, but 18 with this terrain was good (the bitch of the day was a 2,000 foot elevation change late in the day).But the hike is not what I want to discuss... It's the hikers I met today...At the "" you have completed 1/4 of AT"" sign I had Sunset take my picture. We then hiked for a while. Turns out he is a Double Triple Crowner!!! What does that mean.. He has done the AT 2x, the PCT 2x and the CDT 2x!! He is out doing a section hike of the AT in VA... Yes he likes hiking. He is retired and is very humble about his accomplishments of which all of his hikes were done over the age of 50. He mentioned he will have hiked 18,000 miles by the time he is 75.We talked about a lot of things. I listened mostly. I find it fascinating that all the ""lifer"" hikers know one and another and even hike together. As an example Sunset knew Jester (Triple Crown hiker I met and blogged about a few weeks ago).I asked Sunset if he had any advice about timing. He did agree I should be about a week further along at this point (based on the rule of thumb that thru hikers should get to Harper's Fairy by July 4th). His advice was to push for bigger days and avoid zeros. This conversation took place as we hiked up mountains that made us both pause to catch our breath.Later in the day I separated from Sunset and hiked with I Am Liquor for a bit. He is a real character and all around good guy. He carries in his backpack what appears to be a relatively well stocked bar.... Hence his name. I knew he was interesting when we discussed the loud humming noise coming from a high-line we had to hike under. He explained he was an electrical engineer by trade and paused to pontificate the noise. I on the other hand just ran under the tower hoping I did not get zapped when I hiked by the loud power lines. Anyway, I Am Liquor shared with me that he one day hopes to have a wood shop and dabble in black smithing....he is just the kind of guy I could hang around with!The final thing to report is the confederate Calvary horse backing down the AT tonight. We all agreed it appeared like a Memorial Day honor to someone's great great great grandfather who ""took up arms against The North"" or something like that! There was 20 or so horses and many had ""bars and stars"" saddle blankets. When the head honcho of the Calvary stopped to talk to me it was very ""civil war"" like and I imagine rebel soldiers running through these hills over 150 years ago. I wanted to tell him that horses were not allowed on the AT, but I didn't thing me telling him that was worth the southern friend ass kicking I more than likely would have received as trade for my knowledge.When I finally arrived at the shelter many hikers were discussing the Calvary. They were kind enough to give Feather a beer!!! I guess they smelt my Yankee blood or I to may have gotten a beer.   I did not ask feather what kind of beer it was, but by the look of the ""sullen lot"" of riders (as described by Moose), I bet it was Natural Light. All kidding aside, the horseback riders seemed like nice enough people.","Crawfish Trail Camp

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536044,"7/30I fell behind in my blog... It has been crazy. I walked from 8:15 am to 9:30 pm on the 30th and ended covering a total of 24 miles. Along the way I bumped into my old friend Mozy and we finished the last 2 miles in the dark. When we arrived at Helvey Mill Shelter I laid my pack down and fell asleep using it as a pillow. I would have never made the 24 miles if it wasn't for Randy of the Bland County National Wild Turkey Federation offering to slack pack me for 7 miles. In this case I carried my pack, I just unloaded most of the contents in his truck. The light weight pack made it possible to make the big miles. I walked with Mozy (for the record he stayed ""pure"" and packed all of his weight).The reason for the big miles was to get to Trent's grocery. Trent's grocery is located on the Appalachian Trail in his owned and operated by Jimmy Miller a member of the national wild Turkey Federation. Jimmy was kind enough to throw a party for me and 50 of my hiker friends. The celebration was for my fundraiser for the Turkey Federation. It may have been about the turkeys but all the hikers dubbed it ""The Dudefest"". I will cover off on the The Dudefest"" later tonight.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536302,"5/31What a way to end May...Dude Fest 2016. Let me explain. As you know I am attempting to raise some money for the Eastern Wild Turkey restoration efforts in East Texas. I am working with the National Wild Turkey Federation (NWTF) who is supporting and promoting my efforts. The NWTF has members in all 50 states including Virginia and it just so happens Jimmy Miller (who owns Trent's Grocery) is a supporter of the NWTF and decided to throw a party in honor of my efforts. He was kind enough to supply all the food for what ended up being about 50 hikers at his campsite (right next to store). Some how or another Haiku called it the Dude Fest and the name stuck! Rumours of the shindig spread (as I ""advertised it"" in the shelter logs and as I already said... The turn out was epic!Jimmy even slacked packed about 15 hiker's packs for 10 miles ...I was one of the slackers and we were able to cruise right into Trent's without the weight of our packs. This was probabally a good thing as everyone in our bubble had been doing big miles and the break was welcomed. Additionally the 10 miles leading up to Trent's has zero places to fill water bottles and it was hot!!The party (Dude Fest) was held at the campsite and included pulled pork, hamburgers and hotdogs. Of course Trent's is well supplied with beer and several cases found their way into the mix. Many hikers I mention on here were there and several new friends showed up as well. I even met a hiker from Hillsboro, NJ (the town I lived in prior to moving to Texas).I can't say enough about Jimmy and the store. Trent's Grocery is about as cool as a store can be... I mean, here is a place the has everything from honey buns to steel traps (on the same aisle nonetheless). I was impressed with his fishing lure selection , hardware aisle and the breakfast sandwiches. Like many country stored there were a few tables inside and if you ever harvest a bear in Bland County you can check it in at Trent's as well. I think I could live out of that store and be fine.The night went late and we slowly did laundry and prepare to hike this morning. In addition to laundry I sorted out what clothes I will send home now that it is hot. By noon we were mobilizing to the next destination... Dismal Falls. Dismal Falls is anything, but dismal. It's very close to Trent's, but a 1.5 mile hike on the AT. All attendees of the Dude Fest found themselves swimming in the falls and lounging on the rocks.Several hikers decided to call 1.5 miles good for the day. I decided to hike another 6 to the first shelter. At 5:30 I left Dismal Falls and by 5:35 it was raining as hard as it has rained since I have been in the AT! It was torrential! I almost turned back, but I thought.. Hell I am already wet. Plus setting up my tent in that would have sucked!So I made is about 5 miles before it stopped. Parts of the AT were like a river. My boots are beyond soaked. Right before the shelter there was a big pond, some of the Dude Fest attendees were camping there ( Chunks, Navigator, Fury and Big Beard). I stopped to chat and noticed fish in the pond so I broke out my fly rod.... Literally, the tip is broken. Some how or another it snapped. So I duct taped it in the rod and it seemed to work. Chunks gave me a top water popper he found and I tied it to met leader and caught several very small Bluegills. After fishing for 15 minutes I packed up and walked the rest of the way to shelter just before dark. Alastair was there as well as Leslie who I met earlier at Dismal Falls. In addition a section girl named Joel, Tarzan and another couple (Red (he looks like Trey Anastasio) and Crash) were at the shelter. I quickly ate dinner and went to bed. I don't overpromote my fundraising campaign on this blog however due to the Dude Fest I'm going to take a time to share some information if you would like to help the Eastern Turkey restoration efforts in East Texas go to my website www.gofundme.com/turkeyhike and pledge a few dollars. For every one dollar you pledge you will be contributing five dollars to the effort as Texas Parks and wildlife will be matching four dollars for everyone that is raised.

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536677,"6/4I wrapped up the first two months on the trail today with a 20 mile hike out of Pearisburg, VA. I am typing this blog entry from a loft in the Pine Swamp Branch Shelter as the rain comes down.Since I have not posted in a few days I will give a quick update of the last three days.On June 2nd I hiked into Pearisburg from the Wapiti Shelter. Most of the morning I hiked alone. I had no intention in stopping in the Woods Hole Hostel (.5 miles off the trail), but when I hit the gravel road it started drizzling. I took a gamble and headed that way anticipating another major soaking.I made it to the hostel and the sky turned blue and the rain passed as I arrived. I immediately saw Feather and a few others. Pending, who I had not seen since trail days, was there on a ""work for stay"" arrangement. It was good seeing her. That's about all I can say about Woods Hole. I got a weird vibe from the place and ate my lunch and bolted back to the trail. Self righteous hippies are a turn off, nuff said.After getting on the trail I hiked to the first shelter where Gadget was filling up on water. I have not had much interaction with him, but he was at Dude Fest. We talked a minute and I was ready once again hike. I wish now we talked longer, as the play of the day would have been to chill at the shelter one hour and let the unforeseen wicked storm pass.I guess I should have ordered an extra helping of good karma back at Woods Hole, as I only went about a mile when the bottom dropped out! The problem was this storm came with some severe thunder and lightning that was very close to me. In fact it was so close I ditched my trekking poles and took cover in a rhodadundren tunnel. I did not want to move as bolts were hitting everywhere. I seriously thought I would die.The Lightning finally moved off and the rain slacked. I did not get my life lit up so I started walking. Gadget caught up with me and said several people poured into the shelter after I left. Gadget and I would walk the rest of the way into Pearisburg, eat dinner (with Alastair, Red and Crash), and share a room. I was very tired and showering in a motel room was nice (despite the motel having a ""crackhead"" feel to it). 6/3I was bound and determined to get my things done in town and get out. I knew the Dude Fest bubble was coming in and if I ended up at the bar in Barranca (Mexican Restaurant in town) I would have no chance. The bulk of the Dude Fest did go to Woods Hole for a dose of self righteousness and an organic dinner so I knew I had the morning before the piled into Pearisburg.So I headed over to Barranca with Alastair for a quick Michalada or three. With that out of the way I went to the post office and mailed the rest of my winter things home, bought a Sawyer Squeeze at the outfitter (the flow on my mini Squeeze was too slow and home it went), bought crazy glue at the hardware store for my fly rod and resupplied at Food Lion. Then I stopped in Barranca for one more beer. Mayfly was there and soon others. Four hours later we were still there and now joined by about 50 other hikers as a major hiker party erupted with the arrival of the Dude Fest bubble. I got to know Peace Foot (a triple crowner) better and Pilot Bob and I took over the jukebox and kept the Stones, Zepplin, Allmans and other good classic rock stay ahead of the crap some of the youngsters tried to sneak in. Of course I scrubbed my plan to get out of town and I officially declared the day a zero, but hey.... My legs needed a break. Because of our bubble was in town and the crackhead motel was sold out, I was lucky enough that Navigator, Chunks, Big Bird and Stripes made space in their room to crash. I don't like dirty motels so I was ready to hike early the next day.6/4Getting out of Pearisburg is easier said than done. The trail takes you over a big bridge over a river along a highway. As I crossed the bridge a SOBO (south bound hiker) approached. It was already 9:30 and he said ""it's about time the NOBO hikers awake"". He explained I was the first NOBO hiker he had seen that morning. I explained it had something to do with margaritas and coronas at Barranca.I hiked the rest of the day and made Pine Swamp Branch Shelter. The hike had its easy points and it's challenging points. The last half mile was in the pouring rain and Navigator and Big Bird were already at the shelter. Minutes later the Cannibas Kids piled in (I gave them this name because of their none stop pot smoking). Because there were four Cannibas Kids and their dog I gave then the larger bottom shelf of the shelter and took to the loft.","Dude Fest and beyond

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536937,"6/5Don't let your hike get in the way of your hike.... so the saying goes. I think today is a good example of that. Here is the play by play.I woke up stuffed in a loft of the Pine Swamp Branch Shelter. The rain was coming down in sheets making that ""I think I will sleep in"" noise on the metal roof of the shelter. Eventually the Cannibas Kids awoke.... I could tell as the shelter filled with the smells of Colorado. The loft was an odd place as it really did not have a ladder so I delayed my awaking until almost 9:00 am and then shimmied down the post holding the loft in place.Smokey Bear (the Alpha of the CK's) was stirring up his breakfast. One observes people packing in some crazy stuff to add variety to standards, but this is what Smokey whipped up...scrambled eggs with onions and Saracha sauce topped with avacados and a toasted bagel on the side. But here is the deal, he presented it on a plate and it looked like something you would get in a restaurant. Big Bird and I laughed that we wish we videoed him cooking because, well.... He just looked like he knew what he was doing. We also joked that the Food Network should do a hiker trash episode where contestants get 4 bucks and only can shop at a gas station and all ingredients must weigh under a pound. This kid would win stoned as he was.Finally I took the plunge and hiked out. After two months on the trail today I was first out of the shelter, who cares if it was after 10 am and my competition was known collectively as the Cannibas Kids. I hiked the mile down to the Captain's (where we all would have gone if we did not get caught in the rain and settle for the shelter). The Captain's is a private piece of land with the Captain's house on it and a big yard where hikers can camp. The place is located across Stony Creek and hikers access it by taking a small zip-line across. I zip-lined in and immediately saw hikers I knew....City Slicker, Sky High, Texas Hippie, Thumper, Squirrel. I also met Salsa who was on her way back across as I arrived.I got on wi-fi and grabbed a free coke from the refig on the Captain's porch. The Captain is an older gentlemen and he was in the house. I didn't get to meet him, but I am thankful for his hospitality. Squirrel was manning the outdoor griddle under the tent and cooked everyone grilled cheeses. Sky High told me that the AT reconnected up the road so that a trip back across the creek on zip line was not necessary. I convinced two hikers to ""skip"" ahead and we left Captain's and headed up the rode that ran along Stony Creek. That's when I noticed a perfect trout pool. The two unnamed hikers (I can not give names away of other hikers who were weak and took a short cut with me) kept hiking and I stopped and assembled my fly rod. With the look of the pool I was glad I fixed my rod tip in Pearisburg! I tied on an olive woolly bugger (after getting some local advice from a couple in a truck) and preceded to fish. It did not take long before I caught two decent trout and missed a third!I kept to fish as my original intention was to catch a limit and hike them back to the Captain's and let them cook them. When the stream went cold leaving me with just two trout I decided to pack them onto the AT and I would cook them for dinner. I ended up camping at the campsite by Windy Rock. Navigator, Big Bird and Salsa were there. A section hiker brought water and at sunset we all watched the sunset as we sat on Windy Rock. It was a great way to end a great day. Although I did not crush the miles today, I enjoyed the AT.","Swamp Branch Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537274,"6/6Now is the time to make big miles.... While to many it may seem summer is not even here yet, anyone on the AT and serious about actually finishing their journey has to now start hiking ... Especially those still in mid-Virginia (and that is definately me).For those of you planning a thru-hike and following my posts, here is a tip... When you start your thru, immediately stab (in the heart with a hiking pole) the first person who says something about Virginia being easy and ""don't worry you can ""make up miles"" in VA"". The reality is VA is easier than say Georgia or North Carolina, but there still are mountains to climb. We are all making bigger miles, but I think it's more about being in better shape and also seeing the need for greater urgency.The last two days I churned out respectable 17 mile days. Yesterday seemed much more taxing than today. I stopped tonight at the Pickle Branch Shelter where there is a big group of us. The plan is to hike to Four Pines Hostel in the morning. Many need resupply and several (including myself) have a box awaiting.So the following were the highlights from June 6 and 7:I found myself at a shelter (midday lunch) with Alastair (U.K.) and a fast hiker named Lumberjack (Canada). Bring that it was June 6th (anniversary of D Day) I could not help myself and asked both of them why the Brits and Canadians got the easy beaches to land on. Lumberjack being Canadian and 24 didn't even seem to recall there being a war. Alastair on the other hand took a bite and suggested the Germans were too afraid of the Brits and focused on ""the Yanks"".We soon turned to discussing Lumberjacks 30 mile days. I personally don't get why someone would want to take it so fast, but hey man, hike your own hike. I will probabally not see him again or if I do it will be at a hostel and he will have ice on his knees.Alastair and I traded leads back in forth all day the other day. He has a habit of taking breaks and smoking Swisher Sweets. They are not, as he says, ""fine and proper "" cigars. Alastair and I were together when we past the Keffer Oak which is the largest oak on AT in the south. It was 18 feet in diameter and 300 years old. I like trees and this one was impressive.The trail also winded through some open hay fields and meadows. At least one was recently cut, but not yet bailed. I also saw the first sign of beavers (dam and lodge) in a meadow pond. Here in VA their hay fields have steep inclines and the AT goes straight up. Yesterday I turned to an Allman Brithers favorite (Dreams) to help me motor up the open fields and back into the shade of the trees.The day ended at Server Hollow Shelter which was located .4 miles off the actual trail and down a steep hill. It was a tough way to end the day and I knew the climb would suck in the morning.This morning I made the climb out. I was not the last one out, but definately not the first. The first six miles were easy and I hiked with my IPod playing Pink Floyd, Phish, String Cheese and then I went with old country for a period (Merle, Willie, etc.). I listened to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon to get going and it always makes me think of my friend Robert Hogg. Robert is no longer with us and it was good walking alone and reflecting.Midday I stopped at a shelter and the entire crew was there. It seems the crew I left in Pearisburg has caught up as there was Feather, Gaia, Bear Bait, Cake, Big Bird, Salsa, etc. Here we discussed plans for the next few days.The second part of the day was more challenging and included a 1,300 elevation change over one mile. At the top was a bonus... The Audie Murphy memorial. Audie Murphy, originally from Texas, was the most decorated soldier in WW2 and died in 1971 near here in a plane crash. The monument was off the trail and I went up there to see in. Much to my surprise Alastair was up there sitting on one of the two benches and enjoying a Swisher Sweet. Before I left Nsvigator and Big Bird came up as well.The next stop was Trout Creek where once again the crew all ended up. It was only a mile from the shelter we plan on staying so everyone took their shoes off and soaked their feet in the water. It was relaxing. Unfortunately Trout Creek does not have trout (or at least in that part) so my fly rod stayed packed. I soaked the longest and hiked out leaving only Cake who was waiting for a friend to pick her up at the road by the creek. My extra soaking ended up getting me caught in a rain shower just a half mile from Pickle a Branch Shelter where I am now.Pickle Branch Shelter is .3 miles off trail. Jack Rabbit came in after we were all hete and reported two bears at the intersection of the AT and the trail to the shelter and as I type this coyotes are yipping and howling in the woods... This could be an interesting night.","Windy Rock

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537550,"6/8We woke up early this morning. As normal, Alastair crawled out of his tent a hollowed out shell of a man (sorry, private joke). Tank also emerged from her hammock. The previous night we had a healthy debate over the pros and cons of hammocks. For once Alastair and I agreed on something... We don't get ""the hammock thing.""The plan was simple, eat a couple of honey buns chased down with some coffee and hike 6 miles to where the AT dumps out onto the road that leads to Four Pines Hostel, resupply and get back on trail.The first monkey wrench tossed into the plan was that the 6 miles were no ordinary 6 miles. The AT is very challenging in this part and passes through the popular Dragon's Tooth (which Tank immediately climbed as tourist positioned themselves to get pictures of a falling thru hiker).The trail coming out of Dragon's Tooth was even more challenging and in parts became a rock scramble. Alastair and I waked together and chatted as we made our way down vertical rock faces. Parts of it made me think of Angel's Landing in Zion National Park (except here the consequences of a slip would not be as severe). Still The decent to the gravel road where the hostel was located seem to take forever... This seems to be a common effect when there is a destination (especially one that promises food or rest )the trail goes on forever and ever!Finally we reached the gravel road. The hostel was to the right about .2 miles at that point I learned there was a grocery store to the left. Alastair and I were discussing hamburgers and other delicacies on the way down and I decided that is what I needed at that moment so Alastair Tank, Jack Rabbit and myself headed to the grocery store (we all hit the gravel road at about the same time).The grocery store was not too far down the road and it was basically a convenient store that also had a grill. There were several hikers in our group already there sitting in the tables outside including Gaia, Feather and Bear Bait. I ordered a cheeseburger and inhaled it in about one minute and washed it down with a big Gatorade.Almost as planned about that time Eddie from the hostel pulled up in the hostel van. As it turns out Eddie is a retired Philadelphia firefighter so we talked about firefighting and bonded over the fact that I have volunteered as a firefighter for many years. When we were done buying our things we all piled into the van and got a lucky break by getting a ride over to the hostel.I was excited to get to Four Pines Hostel as I had three packages waiting for me there... One from our REI, one from my sister and one from my friend Jeff Held (I credit Just in lighting the fire of an AT through hike when he told me about the trail back in 1989 when we took a road trip across the country). I was excited about receiving resupply from the boxes but yet knew the joy of a light backpack was going to end... That is the curse of restocking your backpack always seems so much heavier coming out of a town or hostel.I spent most of the afternoon sorting through my boxes and repacking my food bag, in addition because it was very warm, I took everything out of my backpack and let the sun shine on it. I was feeling antsy after that and that's when Eddie help me devise a plan for my next day's hike. For whatever reason everybody said catching a sunrise at McAfee Knob was a necessity during a thru hike. I could stay at the hostel, get up super early, hike for miles up the mountain and catch the sunrise. However to do this I would have to first complete 6 more miles so that I did not skip any part of the trail. So at 5 pm I decided I would slackpack the 6 miles and get up at 4 AM to catch the sunrise the next day.It worked perfect Eddie was taking a big crew of people back to the grocery store. He gave me a small slack pack that I could use to carry water and drop me off at the trail on the way to the grocery store.Walking with the tiny backpack with only two waters and some snacks in it was like catching a break. I felt so light and I was making good miles. The Plan was that when I reached the parking lot for McAfee Knob I would call Eddie and he would come pick me up and take me back to the hostel. I did the 6 miles in under two hours! I was very happy I did them in the early evening because it was a very mild walk which took me over open fields, ridges and at one point ran along the stream.I arrived back to the hostel and more people that I knew were there including Mayfly, Sunset and Salsa. It was pretty chilly outside so we all hung inside and had a few beers. Because I had to get up at 4 AM to catch the sunrise the night would not be a late night. I tried to muster volunteers to come along with me but as it stands right now only one hiker by the name of Foxy intends to go with me.","Pickle Branch Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537826,"6/9Salsa bumped me at 4:30 am and told me it was time to get up to see the sunrise. I was thankful she woke me up as I would have slept through getting up despite the fact an obnoxious rooster was already crowing outside.With a crowing rooster I knew I was running late so I grabbed my stuff and was out the door in a minute. Foxy had gotten up as well and he was ready to go which was good...he had a headlamp.We piled into the hostel van and Eddy drove us to the parking lot where my slack pack hike ended the day before. The sky was already starting to lighten up as night was surrendering into pre-dawn. We were running late and we had 4 miles of up hill to go before we arrived at McAfee Knob. I knew the race was on.Foxy gave me his headlamp and asked that I lead. The reality is I only needed the light for the first mile... Dawn was breaking that fast. We made the 4 miles in record time, but as we neared the top we started running into other day hikers coming down (I assume they arrived there early) as sunrise already hit!When we arrived at the top the place was deserted except for the worlds fastest Canadian hiker Lumbejack. We took pictures (which were decent in the early morning post sunrise dawn) and chilled. We may have missed sunrise, but by God I did 4 miles before 7 am and I was happy.The good news was that there were many views along the ridge to see all day. I stopped multiple times to look, take pictures and eat. I met a group of March thru-hikers (can not recall their names) and we chatted as I ate my lunch on Tinker Cliffs. About the my old friend Alastair appeared and eluded to the fact I yellow blazed to get ahead of him. We like to poke at each other. I explained how I arrived at my location without cheating on miles.The remainder of the day was hot and long. I hiked and chatted with Jessie's Girl for a while, but most of the day I was alone. As the day wore on I met many south bound weekend hikers on their way out. They were all concerned about where to camp as the main shelter in the area (Lambert's) is closed due to bear activity. It seems there is s big uptick in bear and snake sightings with the heat really hitting.I finally made it into Daleville and called Sherry Crumley. Sherry is on the NWTF board and is married to Jim Crumley. Years ago Jim pioneered hunting camouflage by developing Trebark Camouflage. The Crumleys live near Daleville and offered me a place to stay when I came through.Sherry picked me up at 3 Lil Pigs (a BBQ restaurant in Daleville) I drank a very cold beer with Alastair waiting for her.When we got back to their place I visited with Jim and Sherry and they fed me dinner. The Crumleys have bear on their land and Jim told me that they are rutting this time of year, this explains why hikers are seeing more. Jim mentioned that he had planted Sawtooth Oaks on his place and the deer and bear loved the acorns. I was sincerely interested in this as I plan on planting Sawtooth Oaks on our farm where the fire occurred last October. Jim agreed to show me his trees in the morning. It was late so Jim took me to their rental building (which is somewhat like a B&B) and gave me run of the place. I ran immediately for the shower and then fell into bed (nicest bed I slept in since I started my hike!). Today was a full day indeed.","Four Pines Hostel

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537988,"6/12Here is a quick update to get me caught up as of NOW. I am sitting at Jennings Creek by the swimming hole. It's still early Sunday. I did 3 miles or so down to here. The climb out of here appears to be a bitch and it's hot!Jim Crumley dropped me off at the outfitters in Daleville after showing me his Sawtooth Oaks and whipping up a quick breakfast. The stay with Jim and Sherry was refreshing, thank you Jim and Sherry.My plan was to resupply and jet out of there ASAP, but that never works. Alastair was in the outfitters agonizing over a summer sleep system and I started yucking with John who worked there about area live music. My next stop was Kroger than back to Three Lil Pigs for lunch and a beer. A group bought us a trail magic round, so I had two beers. I fought the vortex and was on the trail at 5 pm. The Flying Mouse Brewery called, but I fought the urge and ended up at Fullhardt Knob Shelter where there seemed to be more bears than campers. I woke up early the next day and was hiking before 8 am. It's getting hot! I hiked all day and saw very few NOBO hikers. There were section hikers and people hanging out at overlooks on the Blue Ridge Parkway (AT crosses the BRP in several places). Several people offered me water.... Thank you!I hiked all day. It was hot, but the terrain was forgiving. One trail angel warned me that there was NO water at Cove Mountain Shelter (very rare) and warned me to carry my water from a stream 3.4 miles Before the shelter. At the stream I loaded up my Palatapus water bottles and climbed out with 3 liters plus. My pack was heavy and the trail was up! The 3.4 miles went quick, but the haul took it out of me. When I arrived at the shelter I sat at picnic bench and fell asleep. Because the swimming hole that I sit at and type this was only 3 miles from the shelter, most hikers went on to the swimming hole. That being the case there were only two other hikers at the waterless shelter... One in a hammock and one in a tent. I crawled into the empty shelter and pass out. I wish I could say I slept good, but bugs and mosquitos kept biting me. It appears tents with bug nets are the way to go for rest of summer... No more shelters. I am now going to swim and get ready for the climb out of here. Yesterday was a 20 mile day...Probabally won't happen today. The shelter I was targeting to end the day at us closed due to bear activity. I think I will sit here and pontificate my options now that a trail angel just dropped off bananas and apples! Oh dam...so girls are giving out PBRs to hikers just across the creek.....","Daleville

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538258,"6/14Okay, back to our regularly scheduled blogs. I have been missing update largely due to big days, hot weather, spaced out water sources and bugs. Yes, it seems despite big miles this week my ass is being kicked. In fact, I am tenting at mile marker 799!!! So in the morning I cross over to 800!We are camped along a road... The sketchiest camping spot I slept in so far. We have Red and Crash (Red looks like Trey Anastasio of Phish), Alastair and Jethro. Jethro is the the latest new hiker...he started May 8th!!! He the latest ""never see him again"" ... Except we always see them again!!!we all enjoyed getting ""the report from the rear"" and Jethro did meet several hikers that we know and are now behind us.Today we crossed the James River on a long footbridge. That part of the day was pleasant. Then the AT took an evil turn uphill. I promised myself I would not bitch about the trail design and where it ran, but I caved in today. The climb out of the James River Basin seemed pointless to me. Toss in a pretty hot day and limited water and, well, I was bitching.In the afternoon we broke at a shelter with water. We played this one safe and rested an hour and let the heat of the day break. After the break we had only 4 miles to what was referred to in the AWOL guide as a camp by the river. Alastair and I made the March and we arrived we found Red and Crash scratching their heads. No camp. And the river looked nasty.Light was fading so the four of us set up tents in a spot right by the road. Jethro came in later. After we had our tents set up a guy came down the gravel road and said there was a better can up the way. We thanked them, but stayed put.Jethro bailed me out. I pulled a rookie blunder this week and left my stove attached to the gas canister and I believe there was a tiny leak. I am totally out of gas and he boiled my water for me.I am also low on food. Tommirow I will go into Beuna Vista and resupply. Because I am low I had to use the bottom of my food bag... A pasta side with a half a bag of mushroom rice, package of tuna and some garlic cloves. It was GOOD!!! I am ready to get to town in the morning. It's about 6 miles to to gap and then a 5 mile hitch. By then I will be at mile 806!","Jennings Creek

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538354,"6/15Just a quick update before I head out this morning and fight some brutal VA uphills. I am coming to you live from the Budget Motel (think crack and shady characters) in Beuna Vista, VA. Yesterday morning I crossed the 800 mile mark and at the 806 marker made it to the road that lead to where I am now. The 9 mile gap between the AT and the town was bridged by a friendly logger. He was dropping Cake, Foxy and one other hiker back off at the trail heady so Alastair and I hitched a ride with him back into town staffing hydraulic buckets and chainsaws in the back of the pickup. My original plan was to resupply and get back out. However, the last day and a half I have felt totally wiped out of energy. I desperately needed to do laundry and shower as well. With that being the case I elected to settle with 8 miles yesterday and recharge ALL batteries.It was a good move. We are at Subway and I went back to my room and crashed. After an hours nap I woke and started laundry.Laundry out here is a challenge because it creates the dilemma of what to wear while you wash the United clothes that one carries. I wore my rain kilt and nothing else and was glad the coin operated machines were tucked away in the motel.And when we say laundry it's not like an all day affair... We are talking 2 shirts,, 2 shirts, 1 town shirt, 2 sox, 2 liner sox and some bandanas. I am carrying close to the bare minimum (pun intended).We are dinner (Alastair and I)!at the El Tequila Mexican restaurant. I am of the opinion every small town now has a Mexican restaurant and they usually are good. This one did not disappoint. After dinner I resupplied. I tried to pull the resupply off at the Dolllar General. The selection was only okay and I am contemplating venturing to the Food Lion to see if I can round out my food bag. Additionally I have no gas for my stove and there does not appear to be anyone in town that sells it... Despite the town being 9 miles from the AT.The highlight yesterday was a visit to the shaved ice stand. Alastair being from the UK had no idea of what this American delight was when I suggested we stop by. To our surprise the kid working at the stand gave us our ice FREE! Hiker appreciation day at the shaved ice stand!!!!House keeping note... The mile calculation on here is cumulative. I hiked 8 miles yesterday. To get the cumulative miles correct I am showing I hiked significantly more to bring it up to 806.","camp by river

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538791,"6/16Here is something to know....a hiker can not buy a canister of gas in Buena Vista! I know, I looked in 5 places this morning. In addition I ate breakfast at Hardee's... Hardee's is the red headed step child of fast food joints. I am not sure, but that may have been my first venture into one.Alastair and I caught a hitch out of town with a hiker named Irie and his dad. Irie was returning from a trip home and they were glad to give us a lift.We stopped at the gap where we were picked up yesterday and began out day (which was a big climb). The climb on paper looked worse or it may have been my fresh legs. Nevertheless the first part of the day went quick.At lunch Alastair and I noshed on foot long subway's that we bought after we ate breakfast at Hardee's. Lugging the sandwhiches up 6 miles of trail was worth it. The bonus was we were in a cool Meadow with cold water nearby.The second part of the day was very uneventful but at the same time without great stress (except in the heat of the day). By 6 it seemed to start to cool down and by 7 it was showing that the forecasted rain was coming.As luck would have it the shelter appeared as skies darkened. The plan was to go one mile more and grab a little campsite, but with rain approaching we decided to call 14 miles good for the day.Alastair set up his tent outside. Irie already had his place in the shelter and was set up with a bug net system. Seeing that I decided to try my hand at setting up my tent inside the shelter. My method worked great and I was all prepared for a bug free night inside my tent inside the shelter. Right about then the skies opened up.When the skies open up it usually means hikers pour into shelters and in the case they did....several hikers I had not yet yet (Time Warp, C Sharp) and hikers I knew Mayfly and Feather. Time Warp is a younger kid who was formerly loosely associated with the Cannabis Kids, but felt the tug of Maine and moved on. Many hikers who were part of groups seem to be gaining their independence as paces increase.With the new arrivals to the shelter I had to take down my tent (it took up too much space) and make room for the rain refugees. We all cooked our dinner as the rain pounded the shelter. After dinner we all settled in and went to bed.","Beuna Vista, VA

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539411,"Don't count me out!!! I entered the Shenandoahs yesterday morning and hiked 20 miles. The day before I zeroed in Waynesboro. Since I have not updated in a while, I will touch off in highlights of the last several days....6/17 - Pouring rain most of the day. To add to the tough day, we hiked The Priest Wildnerness and Three Ridges. What is Three Ridges? A brutal 10 miles of the AT which starts with a 3,000 foot steep decent followed immediately by a 3,000 climb. Think ass kicker. Think my defining AT moment. At the near top of the climb it was wet, cold and I seemed to be in the rain clouds. It was one I was happy to be done with. The evening at the shelter made up for the bitch of the day. We chatted with section hikers Mike and Shaft. Mike is a partner with Ernst and Young and I promised not to reveal his trail name or else his staff would give him shit. Shaft completed half of the trail many years ago and was knocking out some more miles. Good guys. When we turned in to go to sleep it was cold and I was glad I had not sent home my heavy bag yet.6/18 - A much different day. It started with trail magic at Reeds Gap having only walked two miles!!! A former thru hiker (who I can not recall his name) was offering cold drinks, bananas, sausage biscuits and oranges. He even had beer, but at 9:30 am I elected to go with an ice cold Gatorade.The trail was much kinder than the previous day and I made some big miles early. Being that it was Saturday there were many weekenders about. As a thru hiker we have noticed we are a source of wonderment to many. I chatted with a family group who were all lounging in hammocks and they gave me a big bag of cherries!!!Later in the day I walked with Lewis and Clark (a couple). One of their dad's was walking with them that day. At the last shelter before Waynesboro we all decided to push on another 5 miles and enjoy the town on Saturday night. The shelter was empty (most people already moved on). I blasted out ahead of Lewis and Clark and in about ten minutes I looked up from the trail and there was a little bear poking his head out from around a tree. I knew right away this was a small bear and my limbs would remain attached to my body throughout the encounter. The bear just went doing what bears do and I waited for Lewis and Clark so I could point it out to them. The remainder of the hike was easy and I ended up in Waynesboro walking with Time Warp. Our first stop was the bar.At the bar I met Umpi and Monarch and they offered me a spot in their room. They were heading back so I told them I would join them later. I walked down to the sports bar and saw Lumberjack and we had a beer or two in the sports bar.6/19 - I zeroed. The Quality inn had a breakfast. Umpi was kind enough to wake me up before it was over. We went down and it seemed as if the entire AT was eating breakfast. I was surprised and happy to see my old friends Trout, Voodoo and Blister (aka the Apple Dumpling Gang). 6/20 - After a good zero which included resupply for the Shenandoahs and two trips to Mings ""all you can eat"" buffet, I was ready to get back on the trail.I needed a few more things and stopped at Kroger. After getting the items I struck up a conversation with Rocky. Rocky was kind enough to give me a ride to the heady (which was several miles from Kroger).Rocky dropped me of in the parking lot by the trail head. There was about 40 young girls preparing to hike. The ""leader"" saw me and asked about my hike. He said he takes the group yearly and they were headed south. I was so glad to hear the tribe of 40 teenage girls would not be heading north as navigating past them would have been a pain. Despite my zero I was feeling lethargic.I hiked away from the group. They went south and I went north. I did not go far when I arrived at the Shenandoah sign in station and there was Texas Hippie, Thumper and Sunset. I like these guys. I had hiked with Sunset, but never had hiked with Texas Hippie and Thumper (having only met them in towns and hostels before).We would end up hiking on and off the rest of the day. Bringing up the rear behind us was the Apple Dumpling gand who had emerged from a double zero in Waynesboro hungry to eat miles.Miday Sunset happened upon a big rattle snake in the trail. We moved out of the snakes way and sunset gently poked him with his hiking stick to get him to coil and buzz. Texas Hippie and Thumper seemed genuinely afraid of the snake which is weird because Hippie is from Abilene (lots of rattlers) and Thumper deals with water moccasins in his native Lake Charles.So after the snake was good and angry Sunset said let's go. I suggested to Sunset that leaving a pissed off rattler in the middle of the AT was unwise (especially when it was you pissing it off)! I knew the Apple Dumpling Gang was coming around the corner and I did not want the guy walking point for the ADG to take a viper strike to the leg. So Sunset flicked the snake off the trail with his stick. The snake was so big the hiking stick almost broke.We hiked on into the heat. It was hot and I was lethargic. I decided to take it slow. In the Shenadoahs the AT crosses Skyline Drive back and forth 28 times. By 6:30 I found myself sitting at a crossing with the ADG and Sunset and his crew. After chatting and realizing Sunset, Hippie and Thumper were sleeping against the rock wall and the ADG had some other strange late night plan, I hiked on. It turned out I hiked until 11:30 finally getting to a shelter. Along the way I did some miles along Skyline Drive and enjoyed one of the coolest full moons I have ever enjoyed. Long day. Total miles walked was 20.","Seeley-Woodworth Shelter

At about 3 pm today I stepped over the 1,000 mile mark which is located in the middle of infamous ""The Roller Coaster"".You know why they call it The Roller Coaster, yup, it's because of the ups and downs that the trail takes in the 13.5 stretch. It's Virginia's parting shot to thru-hikers as West Virginia is near!And by parting shot I mean ups and downs that are not only steep, but are laced with many rocks the size of soccer balls. Think feet beating rocks....and it went on and on! But there was relief by way of the Bear Den hostel and trail magic which brought incredible delight.Tomorrow I say good bye to Virginia and hello to West Virginia and the town of Harper's Ferry.

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540207,"Yesterday I said good bye to Virginia as I stepped into West Virginia (the 5th state along the AT). More importantly I put behind The Roller Coaster which meant easier mobility as the trail gave way to Harper's Ferry. I hiked alone all of the 21 plus miles that I did yesterday, so when I ran into Odie and Tracie heading southbound it made my day! Odie does the AT Hikers Yearbook and I think he is a cool dude. Tracie is as good as they get as well. We chatted for a few minutes and went on.Although the end of The Roller Coaster meant the trail was more level, the ankle crushing rocks remained. I guess this is a way to get into shape for the infamous rocks in PA?I stopped at the David Lesser shelter midday. I was out of energy and I needed water. Weather Or Not was there. The spring was .25 miles down a steep hill, but the side journey was required....springs are few and far between now.After fetching my water I ate some food and visited with Weather Or Not. He is about my age and he was talking about low energy. Every once in a while I feel drained, but a little rest, water, food and Ibuprofen seems to help. He was staying at the shelter, I gathered my stuff and bolted.My goal was Harper's Ferry and I put my earphones on and hot play and the IPod. Phish, Yes, Robert Earl Keen, Grateful Dead and Allmans gave me the push I needed to do the 8 more miles into Harper's Ferry. An added bonus was the sighting of several deer and even a turkey that hauled ass when he heard my singing to the music. When I finally arrived at Harper's Ferry it was 7:15 and the ATC was closed. I will go down there this morning and get my picture taken. All through hikers stop at the ATC to get their pictures taken at the unofficial halfway mark of Harpers Ferry.With the ATC being closed I did the next best thing and went to a bar. When looking for fellow hikers, always look in a place that peddles beer. At this particular bar I found Alastair, Chia Pet, Mogli and Blossom. They appeared to already have had several buckets of beer. At another table was Jack rabbit and his parents.I sat with the crew and ordered two buckets of beer and we got caught up on trail Gossip and things. The beer was cold we had some cheap cigars and some good laughs.At Closing time I called the Teahorse hostel and reserved a bunk for the night. The combination of 21+ miles in one day and a handful of beers made for a very early night once I got to the hostel. I am heading to ATC now and then moving into Maryland. Kelly will pick me up tomorrow and we will enjoy a few days together.","Bear Den Hostel

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540707,"Okay... Well tonight is July 3rd and I am stealth camping in Maryland with another hiker named Lord Bearclaw. Lord Bearclaw carries a Roman sword and wears a kilt... I could not make this shit up.But let me digress. I hiked out of Harper's Ferry on the 30th after stopping by the ATC and getting my picture taken. I was hiker 1,135 that registered, which is high....there are many hiking this year. After registering I hiked out of town and to Dahlgren Campground and into Maryland. The trail was quiet. The campground was 17 miles from Harper's Ferry and was the designated place to meet Kelly on the 1st. Along the way I hiked with Sidewinder and got to know him better.I awoke at 8am the 1st and Kelly texted me and said she will be there at 9 am. The campground had a shower (rare) and I took advantage to knock off some of my crud before seeing Kelly. When I walked up to the shower building much to my surprise I spotted Feather sleeping outside of the bathroom. Feather is s good guy who maintains odd hiking hours. He told me he stumbled in during the night.I showered and stuffed all my stuff into my backpack. The strap on my pack gave out as I walked down the C&O canal towpath (coming out of Harpers Ferry) so I figured it would be for the last time as I intend to get a new pack. (Will arrive by mail up trail in PA).I told Feather I planned to take alastair to Gettysburg with Kelly and I on the 2nd. He seemed down so I suggested he come with us. He said yes and he decided to get a ride back to Harper's Ferry with Kelly and I.Feather and I hiked out to the road and Kelly came by and picked us up. It was good to see her. We drove back to Harper's Ferry where we re-visited the ATC and then had lunch. I showed Kelly how the AT winds around Harper's Ferry including the parts through historic downtown.We spent Saturday the 2nd at Gettysburg watching battle reinactments, visiting the museum and eating. Sunday the 3rd Kelly and I had breakfast and quickly visited the Antienham battlefield where in 12 hours the two civil war armies beat the hell out of each other for 12 hours done 154 years ago resulting in 23,000 casualties. Here we also learned there was a firework show, the night before when we were in Gettysburg. Bummed we missed that.Kelly then took me to do a quick resupply and dropped me off where she picked me up back on the 1st. We had leftover beers from the weekend and we put them on a post for trail magic. Almost immediately a hiker named Three Times enjoyed a cold beer. I shared the trail with him most of the day... Along with what seemed like hundreds of day hikers. At dark I stopped at a shelter to sign the log. I advertised I was heading on to Raven Rock Shelter 4.9 miles away. Lord Bearclaw was Setting up camp but asked me if he could join me for the night hike. I said sure. It would end up we would tackle 6 miles together in the dark climbing at one point what was a significantly Steep hill up Raven Rock. The entire time Lord Bearclaw bestowed onto me his knowledge of ancient weapons and tactics and how to deploy them when confronting unruly neighbors or when playing sword fight with his friends from the Society of Creative Anachronism... a club that celebrates the lifestyles from the 600s to 1600s (think civil war reenactment but middle age). Since Bearclaw was toting a sword we decided I would go first... That way if a bear killed me he would have time to unsheath his saber and take revenge. We stumbled on through the dark. The trail was easy all day, but took a turn for the worse as we plodded on and rocks filled the trail. I was using my new headlamp that I recently scored from a hiker box which turns out to be a bit dim. In the confusion we passed the Raven Rock shelter despite a personal message scribbled in the dirt with what I now know was Feather's hiking pole. The message made reference to my sexual preference (and was dead inaccurate). Despite The personal calling card in the dirt we miss the blue blaze to the shelter and proceeded another mile down the trail where we are breaking camp now. Lord Bearclaw continues to educate me on midevil topics and other wacky facts. Happy 4th of July everyone. I will be stepping into Pennsylvania here in four short miles where I intend to celebrate the birthday of this great nation of ours in the state where it all began!!!","Harper's Ferry

I am resting tonight at a very cool hostel called the Iron Mountain Hostel in Pine Grove Furnace State Park in PA. It was very hot today. Despite the heat we made 20 miles! Along the way we took pictures of the official half-way mark.On the trail today was Alastair, C Sharp, Wallet, Eagle, Puppy Mill, Inky and his girlfriend (I just met them and I can not remover her trail name). We lost Feather after breaking camp this am and we have no clue where he ended up. Add to the list of characters today Lord Bearclaw and his sword!The two exciting things today Serra rattle snake and cookers full of beer and steaks.First the rattler. Alastair and I were in deep walking midday and pontificating trail stuff when I stepped down and about on a big timber rattler! It immediately started to rattle and made a move to strike. I hauled ass and told Alastair to get back!I won't lie, it startled me. The thing was it would not budge so we made signs in the dirt indicating there was a rattler (we knew Inky and Bearclaw were not too far from us and we wanted no surprises). As Alastair made a sign out of sticks I tried to chase the coiled serpent away, but it did not move.We ran into Lord Bearclaw and Inky at a stream as we filled water. They saw our signs and saw the snake!!! In the middle of the trail! They too had a tough time navigating around this beast which I guess was 6 feet long. This was a big snake!The coolers. AT hikers get accustomed to coolers sitting on the trail set there as trail magic. Typically they have Gatorade, cokes or beer. Many times it's a buzz kill when the lid is lifted and they are already emptied by other hikers.This afternoon I was hiking behind Alastair about 100 yards. I crossed a gravel road and spotted two coolers just off the trail in the bushes. Naturally I investigated. Jackpot... This coolers was filled to the rim with ice and very cold beer! I hollered fairly loud. Loud enough for Alastair to come back and suggest I look in the other cooler. I was thinking... How can this get better?Inside the second cooler was ice and steaks. Oh no. No one would leave uncooked steaks for hikers. We theorized these were not trail magic coolers and a part of someone's camp out. We also saw there was a bag of firewood further suggesting this booty was not left for us. So we took the high road and left it all..with exception of s few ice cubes from the beer cooler. The oddest thing was no one behind us saw the coolers?? Weird.","Raven Rock Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541882,"And the crowd screams out for another blog entry and they get it!!!! Wow, it seems like the days lately are filled with many many high points, some low points and several AT landmarks.First off, today I found myself resting at mike market 1,189. This is significant as there are 2,189 miles to the AT this year...I have less than 1,000 miles to go!Pennsylvania has been relatively easy so far! Even the infamous Pennsylvania (Rocksylvania) rocks have not been too brutal (yet). I hiked past the 501 shelter at 5:00 pm tonight. The next several miles all the way to Port Clinton are supposed to be real rocky so tomorrow may be a different story.Since I last posted I hiked through Boiling Springs, PA. I would say this was the nicest town the trail ran through so far. I came into Boiling Springs on a low as I was out of water and I fell 5 miles short of getting there the previous night. My spirits were lifted when I hiked into the Cafe 101 in town and had a great breakfast and a warm welcome from other patrons. I also stayed in the Doyle hostel in Duncannon, PA. The Doyle is an old hotel that was once owned and operated by Anhauser Busch. Evidently the folks that bring us Budweiser took a venture into the hotel business many years ago. The Doyle is the last one that is operating ... All others are gone or abandoned.The Doyle looks old and feels old and is old. Despite a well worn feel to it, it's a must stop for hikers. Did I mention there is a bar in it? A fairly big crowd was there when I hiked in including Sunset, Texas Hippie, Alastair, blossom, mogley and Wallet. My new Osprey Exos backpack was waiting there and I did the change out right there in the bar.Last night we jumped off the trail and hiked into the town of Lickdale for a cold drink. We were lucky enough to catch a hitch easy enough. When we were dropped off another car pulled up and we were offered a place to stay in Doc's camper. Doc is a trail angel and an interesting dude. He was a combat medic in Vietnam in 68 and 69. He did not tell us why he put hikers up, but I got the sense he liked the company. I hit it off with Doc as he had to old Ford tractors at his place like the kind Kelly and I have at our farm. The generosity of people I have met on this journey is humbling.","Pine Grove Furnace State Park

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542850,"Okay... Back to the blog. First an update. I crossed over in New Jersey today. I felt great to do so as many of you know New Jersey is where I was born and raised until I was 16. Physically I am feeling best up hard. It's been very hot and humid and I have been contending with what felt like a pinched nerve in my left leg. As of yesterday the condition seems to have approved, but it has forced me to slow down a bit.Equipment wise the Pennsylvania rocks have eaten my boots. My soles are gone. I am going to order a new pair of Vasque boots from REI tonight and have them shipped up the trail. My boots are the original ones I scored at Neels Gap when I swapped out the smaller Vasques after the first 40 miles. I have no complaint about these boots...they have taken me 1,30O miles. The rocks in PA lived up to their reputation and I noticed it seemed to take a mental toll on hikers and caused some to want to go it alone versus carry on in groups. From my perspective it seems that this phase of the hike there is a greater need to really practice hiking your own hike.So let's see where I last left off....we just stayed with Doc in Lickdale. The next day we hiked out. That's when I noticed the call for a greater need for independence. We all seemed to do our own pace and I walked alone most of the day.The next day it was more of the same, but it started with Feather stopping in front of me for the first rattlesnake of the day. Later that day Alastair was 20 yards ahead of me and literally stepped over a coiled rattler without noticing it.The end of that day brought us all to the town of Port Clinton. The descent into this trail town was extreme. The good news was there was a private club located inside the fire station. Club is an understatement... It was a full blown bar. Hot and thirsty I knocked on the door (you had to have permission by ""a member"" to drink there). Already there was Mogley, Blossom and Alastair taking advantage of the 1.25 draft Yeungling Lagers. I joined them and soon Feather.After several beers we rolled down to the Port Clinton Hotel and ate chicken wings. Feather ate a few of mine... Little did we know that would be the last thing Feather would eat for days.After dinner we went back to the fire station club for one more beer. I met Brother Blood who blogs on here and heard Storm was in town. There were many hikers in town. Some I knew and done I did not. Game of Thrones rolled in while we were eating at the hotel.The next day I woke up and went to the Port Clinton barber shop to get my beard cleaned up. Feather went with me. The place was very old school and Frank (the barber) welcomed hikers. Frank was a cool dude and seemed to be passionate about two things; classic rock and Jimi Hendrix.After Feather had his turn in the barber chair, Schmegal showed up. She is a French hiker who I first met in Harper's Ferry when she took Kelly and my picture for us. Feather and Schmegal caught a ride into Hamburg for resupply while I sat in the barber chair. Later Feather texted me and said he got s room and was not feeling good. I would find out days later he had Guardia and was terribly sick for days. He just started hiking again TODAY!!!After my beard- cut I hiked out of town and stealth camp about 7 miles or so from Port Clinton. The climb out was not fun and I turned a zero day into a nero (minimal miles).The next day I put in an honest day and ended it at a road crossing called Blue Mountain where there was a restaurant! What a great way to end a day! I met fellow hikers Brew, Danger and Red Dragon at the bar. I had not met these hikers prior. The bonus came when I discovered the restaurant allowed tenting in their backyard so I stayed until 10 o'clock (closing time) and enjoyed cover music by a two man band that was actually very good. The next day I was scheduled to resupply in Palmerton and hike back out. When I finally hitched into Palmerton my left leg was killing me. It felt like a pinched nerve... Regardless, I could hardly walk. So I did what any wise hiker would do and called the Sunny Rest Resort (a clothing optional kind of place) and caught a shuttle up there. Yup, they had a hot tub and yup it felt good to soak in it. And yes I took off my clothes and it felt good not to have sweaty, dirty shorts on for awhile. I left the next day. The day was insanely hot and I carried a ton of water with me. Or at least it felt like a ton, it was probabally more like 6 pounds. I hiked behind a hiker called Crocamole. He earned his trail name by carrying avacados in his Croc camp shoes and letting the avacados get smashed.I was glad he was out that day as my leg acted up towards the end of the day when we were trying to do 5 more miles into the town of Wind Gap. The pain in my leg was pretty severe and I appreciate Crocamole hiking behind me until we reached the road.Once we arrived into Wind Gap we descended into town and landed at the Stein Room or House. Whatever it was called they served a great French Dip and Coleslaw and of course a few Yeungling lagers. I am Liquor showed up as he was waiting until Monday to get a box from the post office. Liquor commented that I looked like I lost weight. I said the same thing about him! It seems the long miles are taking a toll on our bodies. After eating Crocamole and I split a room and I was asleep before my head hit the pillow. In the morning I felt tired, but my left leg was feeling better. The motel where we crashed was a few miles from the trail so I suggested to Crocamole we eat at McDonalds, generate a conversation withheld retired guys and pull a ride out of the deal. The plan worked like a charm. The goal for the day was Delaware Water Gap, PA... The gateway to NJ. The rocks of PA started to show signs of a moderate decline in intensity, but the thunderstorm brewing did not. I must be living right as I hiked into the kirk ridge shelter one minute before the skies let loose! I sat there for an hour and watched it rain and then continued my hike as soon as the storm passed.I stayed at a church hostel in Delaware Water Gap last night. Or sort of. The bunk room was full of hikers who elected to zero because of the rain. Lucky there was a shelter in the back and only one hiker, a girl named Big Red, had set up shop in there. I set my ""camp"" up and again the skies opened up. The shelter had a metal roof so the sleep was good despite the air being humid.Still thinking I needed rest I rolled out of the shelter at 8:30 with no immediate plan to hike into NJ. I knew I was not going to zero, but the day would start when it started. As I was getting out of the shelter and laying my wet clothes on the hot pavement to dry I saw a couple with a car and I recognized the dude's voice. It turns out it was Seven (or 7).7 is the infamous ""hiker trash"" video guy that puts YouTube videos up of hikers doing... Well stupid shit. We visited for a while and he offered me a ride to Walmart for ""gas money"". I appreciated it as the food bag was low. After resupply 7 dropped me back at the church hostel where Big Red and another couple were leaving. I needed someone to hike with so I could get a picture at the PA/NJ line. As it turns out I hiked out with Crocamole.","PA Rocks

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543335,"Well as I type this I am four miles from the NY border. Tomorrow morning I say goodbye to good old NJ. NJ has been very good to me and the 75 miles of trail through the state are very interesting. Most hikers agree, NJ is cool... That's not just because I am a Jersey Boy!What's cool about the trail in NJ? It winds through a diverse setting of woods, ridges, fields, swamps and even roads. In addition there are a few steep but short climbs. There is a lot of places to stop and eat and perhaps have a beer. It keeps the hikers interested. Last night a hiker named Time Warp had a hiker get together at his house. He lives 3 miles from trail in Orange County, NY. I was 20 miles behind and I hiked across NY border to Unionville, NY where he picked me up.At the party were a lot of familiar faces, many of them a day or so ahead of me now. In addition Time Warps dad, a retired NYPD Officer and avid deer and turkey hunter, was there and we hit it off.This morning the day already was showing promise of high heat. Because I was 20 miles back the suggestion was made that I should leave my pack at Time Warps and get a ride to Unionville and slack pack back to his house (hike with minimal weight).His dad shuttled me down to Unionville where I rejoined the trail on the NJ side of the road and began a great day if hiking without 35 pounds on my back. The day ended with a quick shuttle back to his house where I had dinner, a shower and did laundry... Yes I am grateful!!!!One other thing I have to mention about NJ. My old friend Kevin Kolans came up from Hillsborough to see me. We met at Gyps Tavern in Branchville. As I waited for him the biggest bear so far came out of the woods and was trying to get into the dumpster at the tavern!! We had a great visit when he arrived and and even better breakfast the next day!I am posting pictures of my hike on Instagram and I started a thread of my hike on Texasbowhunter.com. Hello to all TBH users who are now following my blog. The other day someone on TBH asked about the social aspects of the hike where I am today versus earlier on. I thought I would try to explain...Early on there are a lot of hikers and everyone of them are excited about the newness of the journey. Additionally new starters are not worn down yet. Because of this it seems there is more social interaction, people tend to hike together or in groups and hikers are generally more up beat.Fast forward 1,350 miles and things change. PA beat the hell out of hikers and this was obvious from looking at the faces of hikers at the Delaware Water Gap... People were beat. Throw in some wicked high temps, big mile days and a few injuries and hikers are a little less excited about chatting. This has an effect of more alone time, which is really kind of cool because alone time enables one to think about things. It has been interesting to see the social ""game"" shift out here. Another interesting observation is that I continue to meet new hikers!!! Within the last few days there has been several who have started much earlier than me but had gotten off the trail for what ever reason. In addition there is an occasional very late starter that comes by who is making big miles on a daily basis.","MOC in NJ

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543670,"A day in the life. Today started out early! Like real early partly because I wanted to get moving before the heat and humidity and the other reason was we were stealth camping in a place that was more than likely off limits.Last night Skittles and myself decided to hunker down underneath a pavilion by a public swim lake just off the AT after a major rain storm pushed a bunch of hikers there. Some hiked on into the soaked woods and others found the rain a good excuse to go and get a hotel. Having just showered and done laundry a Time Warp's house I chose to just stay at the pavilion and make an early get away before anybody could show him.Right before dark good old cranberry came walking in so it ended up being the three of us. The only negative drawback was at dusk a light came on and illuminating pavilion and making sleep a little difficult.So at 7 AM I was packed and out of the pavilion because of yesterday's rain and heat I have to admit I was feeling a little bit down. Mood changed when no more then 300 yards from pavilion I ran up into a middle of a big group of wild turkeys! Hens, poults and later as I got on the actual trail I saw the gobblers! But that was all the excitement for the morning. The woods were actually very wet and humid because of last nights rain. It was cool but I guessed the afternoon was going to be a scorcher. I was right.The first four miles to the William Brien Memorial Shelter were easy enough and I was there by 9:15. Easy as they were, I was covered in sweat from the humidity. I was originally going to land at that shelter last night, but balked when the rain held me at the pavilion. Skittles had beat me there and we both agreed the pavilion was a better call. Most shelters have a rudimentary broom or something to clean it out this one did not and it was absolutely filthy. New York's terrain is not easy. It seems that the little break we caught in New Jersey was the most recent AT cruel joke...as in we were lead to believe the AT is easy until the White Mountains. Not the case. New York's mountains seem to be laid out perpendicular to the AT and this means all day ups and downs. And at the top of each mountain is a big solid rock bald. The designers of the trail must've thought these balds are special because they damn sure want you to see everyone of them! And because they are rocks there's no trees growing around the tops on the mountain making it very hot once you crest. But you are not up there long! The trail takes you down into a little ""valley"" and then up again.The entire time the only thought in your mind is your rapidly diminishing water supply. Water is very scarce in these mountains and calculating how much you'll need until the next source is critical. Yesterday trail angels left multiple jugs of water by road crossings today we didn't have that luck.The trail today took me up Bear Mountain, A popular tourist spot with a view to the New York City skyline. About the only thing that I cared about upon reaching the top of Bear Mountain was the vending machine that dispensed Powerade. I bought one 20 ounce blue Powerade and sat down and leaned up against a tree and drank it. I'm pretty much sure that one drink was the best 20 ounces of liquid I have drank in my adult life. So I went back for another one...this time the red fruit flavored variety. After sitting against the tree for longer than a few minutes I decided it was time to hike on so I bought one more blue Powerade for the road. I did not make it far when I bumped into Sky and 1% at the big stone tower atop the mountain. As I talk to them I started drinking the third Powerade. A tourist came up and started asking questions about our hike. He violated the three question rule ...meaning after three questions the expectation is we get some kind of drink or food (it's like being a zoo animal). In his defense I was quickly drinking the last of my third Powerade so he may have thought I was covered. I now had crushed three Powerades and I thought it was better to just go buy a bottle of water and carry that with me for the rest of my hike. Having done that I began my dissent to the Hudson River Valley. The dissent consisted of many stone steps that were articulate in design .... the only bummer was it seemed visitors felt compelled to throw their trash all over the place. I saw more litter in this one small section than I have seen in all of the trail itself. Sad.I arrived at the bottom to the Bear Mountain recreational area and a place called Hessian Lake. There was a mass of humanity as the day was warm and people were out enjoying the lake. I noticed another set of vending machines and in my weakened state bought yet again one more blue Powerade. I hope you understand and appreciate how thirsty I was today!I hiked around the lake and under US Highway number nine and through the area that contained the zoo. Yes, zoo! Because it was after 4:30 in the afternoon the zoo was closed and therefore I had to make a bypass around (yes, The AT runs right through the zoo normally). The bypass was a blue blaze that ran in back of the zoo I was highly confident that I was either going to find a body or a hidden ganja patch as it didn't seem many people took the bypass. The bypass eventually took me back to the proper AT where it connected to the walkway of the Bear Mountain bridge over the Hudson River. I strolled across the bridge as commuters raised by it was very empowering to walk across that bridge with nothing but a backpack. I was wondering the whole time what the people in the cars or thinking I was doing.After crossing the Hudson river I took a steep climb back up out of the Hudson river valley and found my camp for the night. As I was making the steep climb I met a guy who was running the trail he stopped and we talked for a minute. He asked me how far I had hiked and that's when I realized that I literally had just crossed the 1,400 mile mark!Northbound hikers continue to be scattered, but as I'm typing this blog more are starting to reach this campsite and it actually has about seven camping here for the night. Of interesting note, as I was making my initial ascent up Bear Mountain today I passed the first southbound hiker coming from Maine. This is actually right on schedule and I am confident I'll see more in days to come. We stopped and chatted for just a few minutes the conversation revolved around water sources.","Time Warps House

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543769,"Today was on par as yesterday, very hot and limited water on the trail. The terrain however was not as extreme for the most part.Today's highlights included the Appalachian Market Deli that was located approximately 4 miles at the road crossing from where I camped. I left out of camp at about 730 and anticipated making it to the deli for a late morning brunch and did I!!The Appalachian Market deli is basically a big convenient store that serves commuters going into New York City. Because the store is right on the trail they also cater to hikers including much-needed gas for my camp stove. I made it to the store first followed closely behind by Moose Dancer and Thresher both guys who stayed at the camp last night. Third hiker also showed up but I cannot recall his name? My first swoop through the store included a simple purchase of a blue Powerade and a small Italian ice. By now you know how much I love blue Powerade, but the Italian ice was the winner today!!!My next foray into the store included a Bronx Bomber, a roast beef and provolone melt sandwich that was about a foot long, two more bottles of Powerade and another Italian ice. After eating and drinking like it was Thanksgiving the time was almost 11 o'clock and the heat was rising . One by one we left the store and headed back onto the trail. I see-sawed back-and-forth with Thresher the rest of the day. I tried to stay ahead of him because man this kid stinks! Along the way we met a southbounder who started on March 27 at Mount Katahdin in Maine. He appeared to be a hard-core hiker but said he was thinking about throwing in the towel. He explained that starting in Maine and going through the White Mountains was amazing and now on the ""green tunnel"" was completely boring him. I definitely could understand as the man had 1400 miles of ridges until he arrived at Springer Mountain in Georgia. He summed it up best by saying we have the best for last and we basically have only eaten the crust! That encouraged me because the green tunnel is starting to get old and I look forward to a change of scenery and the White Mountains.Towards the end of the day I met a man sitting by the road relaxing he told me there was a little waterfall down the way. I followed the trail and there it was a tiny waterfall that would be my shower for the day! The good news was the water was running from a beaver pond just upstream and the water was not too terribly cold. In fact it was very soothing and I stripped naked and showered off and the waterfall... Dirt, grime sunscreen and sweat gone! Because the water was running directly out of the beaver pond I did not take a chance and fill up my bottles at the stream.There's a funny recurrence that is happening to me. It started over a month ago. Almost daily now somebody is asking me why I am so behind. What's funny is they don't seem to ask anybody else. The man sitting by the road today asked me in a very nice way if I thought I will make it to Katahdin in time. When I caught back up with Thresher this evening I asked him if he was asked the same question and he was not. It's just one of those funny reoccurrences that's happening to me.The reality is I am fine on time. My goal is to finish this journey no later than October 1. Based on the miles I have left and the number of days until October 1 I have to travel north by 12 miles a day. Granted I'm sure I will take some days off and I'm sure the going gets slower in the White Mountains, when I am in no need to panic. I am wondering what people say to hikers that are two and even three weeks behind me. At this point I know several and all of them plan to reach Katahdin.There are some Hikers who naïvely believe that they have until October 15 when Baxter State Park officially closes. That's all fine and well however I do not plan on being on top of a mountain in Maine in mid October, but it's nice to know I have that cushion.For those interested in the math I'm sitting at mile 1,423 tonight. This year there is 2,189 miles to the trail. Therefore I have 766 miles remaining and 65 days before October 1 to do it in. The math comes out to 11.78 miles a day. Again there's going to be days when I take near zero or zero days and the hiking slows down in the White Mountains. That is why I am trying to make bigger miles here in New York despite the heat. Today I did 18 miles.","Hemlock Springs Camp

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543882,"Today was a good day it was once again hot and humid but I managed to crank out a 20 mile day! The amazing thing was I rested at deli/pizzeria in the heat of the day and still did the miles.My feet are hurting tomorrow I going to Pawling New York and get my new pair of shoes at the post office. My original Vasque boots are falling apart. That's not a bitch these things have carried me 1,450 miles!There was nothing extra ordinary about today's hike just pounding out miles. I think I had such a good afternoon because I was able to fill up at the pizzeria/deli. I ate a slice of pizza and a foot-long chicken sandwich with melted cheese. I also drank a couple of Gatorades (they did not have Powerade) and I had to Italian ices.After the feast Thresher, Moose Dancer and I found some shade behind the deli where they set up a spot specifically for hikers and waited out the heat of the day.Because there's no real highlights I'm going to address some questions that have recently been asked of me on another website called Texas Bow Hunter. Questions involved decisions that I have made both in preparation and during my hike thus far.Preparation best and worst decisions:By far the best decision was to seriously take into consideration the weight that I was going to be carrying. I built an XL spreadsheet and calculated everything that I considered for the journey and constantly monitored the weight I would be carrying. Without this I'm confident I would have started with 10 more pounds of useless weight and that could have been disastrous. I am also happy that I did not live this journey via YouTube and books before I did it. I wanted to be surprised about what I saw and I purposely did not over plan places that I ""must see"" or watch all the videos that exist about hiking the trail.Regarding the worst decision, doing it again I would have started a little bit earlier. I started April 5 looking back I would have been better off starting at the end of March say March 25 26 or 27th. There is no way you can be in shape for the mountains of Georgia especially if you live in Houston Texas and I moved very slow at first. An earlier start would have given me a few days cushion to stop and enjoy now that I have my trail legs. Live and learn.On the trail best and worst decisions:The worst decision was the bowl of time I spent in and around the Damascus Trail Days. Trail days itself was very fun and something I would absolutely recommend any hiker to attend however the manner in which I did it ended up costing several extra days that I wish I had to use elsewhere. The best on trail decision I made was to live to the standard of ""hike your own hike"" On the surface it seems like such a cliché kind of phrase but it's the difference between success and failure out here. Hiking at your own hike forces you to make some critical decisions that are not always the easiest like when to not like with someone any longer it also results in you being alone at times. I've also come to learn that if you were uncomfortable with being alone you're probably not going to survive a thru hike. In the beginning it was like one big social every night at shelters that is not the case anymore. It's like as I type this I'm sitting in the middle of the woods alone in a tent and I'm perfectly comfortable with this.I hope tonight's blog was informative and I hope I have some neat stuff to report tomorrow I know I will be happy to have my new boots let's cross our fingers and hope that Vasque sent the right ones!!","Stealth camp

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544439,"Boy what a few days does to changing everything...especially a few days of rain!!! When I last updated I mentioned the heat. Since then Connecticut (and most of the east coast) has been slammed with rain. The rain did two things: 1) drained my energy and 2) really cooled things off.I was in Kent Connecticut on Saturday. I had to race in to get a care package from a friend. The bulk of the box contained a giant roll of toilet paper and some cans of Wolf Brand Chili. Haha, everybody is a joker Andrew! Kent, Connecticut is home of the $7 beer at ""the tavern"" as well as the $175 a night ""weekend in rate"". I seriously think cargo shorts might be illegal wear in this place..despite it being an uppity place, people were very friendly. The point is, as I was drinking a $7 beer (which a very nice patron bought me) it started to rain...heavily.   I waited amount the rain and was given a ride back to the trail by a couple who were eating at the tavern. My plan was to save money by hiking in the misty woods and set up my tent quickly. All went to plan and that's a good thing since the bottom then dropped out and it rained all night. I am packing what I believe is the best tent for the AT... Despite that, after an all night deluge, stuff gets damp.In the morning I packed my wet stuff and started out. There was not a lot of north bounded but I did see Moose Dancer. All morning I kept seeing an occasional southbounder (I also saw several in Kent).The day was overcast and at 3:30 I found myself at a camp with a pavilion. I fell asleep and was awoken at 4:30 by Lt. Dan. Lt. Dan is a nice 20 something year old kid who looks EXACTLY like Lt. Dan in Forest Gump. Then Heavy D rolled in. He is a colorful character that I have only briefly met prior. Heavy D brought in to camp with him a forecast of more rain at 5:00. I was not having it and I was bound to go 7 more miles to the next shelter. Off I went and the rain started.I made it to the shelter at dark. It was the wettest and nastiest I felt during the entire hike. The only good news was it was not cold.In the shelter was Fremont, Thanks A lot and a southbounder girl ... Let's call her Scared of Mice because she was. Before I could crawl into the shelter another odd southbounder came hiking up and dove into the shelter soaking wet. After a brief one way conversation about shelter etiquette and thinking about the dry people inside the shelter, we settled down for the evening. The rain pounded the metal roof for two hours and then it settled down. Being crammed in a shelter full of wet hikers is not joyous especially when one is afraid of shelter nice and wakes everyone up everytime she heard or saw one. The reality is there were a lot of Vermin amongst us... It's part of the journey.In the morning I was the last one to clear out. All of my things were soaked from the walk on the rain the night before. I don't mean damp, but soaked. I put on wet sox and boots, shorts and shirt. I did not realize then that that crappy night of sleep and the wet clothes would soon drain me of all energy.I hiked to Falls Village and I was hoping for something hot from a deli or something. The best Falls Village could offer was a package store the sold beer, liquor, sodas and Gatorade. They did not have even one stick of beef jerky in the place! I bought a Gatorade and a Yohoo and walked across the street and found shelter under the inn's porch (closed on Monday) since the dreaded rain was back again.I drank the drinks and ate a pack of tuna and concluded I needed to get off the trail and dry out. So I found Maria Mcabe's number in AWOL's guide and called her. Maria turned 87 that day, but that did not stop her from doing what she has been doing for the last 17 years... Putting up hikers for $35 a night. For your $35 you get a shower, clean bed, breakfast (2 eggs and a banana, a shot of OJ, a bagel or a muffin). Since it was Maria's 87th bday I also got to go to dinner with her (Chinese) and the other hikers that were staying with her which was, Chatterbox (he was quiet), Moon Fire (a girl from Germany) and Flashlight (a thru hiker from 1999 doing from Harper's to Katadin this year). Maria's friend Jim was kind enough to pick up the tab. The dinner was good, but ran way to long and I was fearful I was about to do a face plant into what was left of my Happy Family meal from the Chef's Special menu. We agreed to do resupply in the morning (thank god). Maria was happy as well and we raced back to her house and all sat with her and watched the exciting season finally of The Bachlorette). I did not last long, but outlasted Moon Fire and Chatterbox before exhaustion finally landed me into bed.I woke up late this morning. It was overcast and it looked like more rain. Jim was kind enough to shuttle Flashlight and I to the laundromat which was of the highest of priorities. While we did laundry we ate at a pizza place next store. I crushed a salad and a foot long steak and cheese. It was good!!!After that we relaxed at Maria's house, the entire time I was hoping for sun so my pack and tent would dry. My plan was to hike out at 4 if the rain looked like it was passing. Moose Dancer showed up (he was staying tonight) and we convinced Jon to shuttle us to the store for a quick resupply. After resupply I quickly packed. Jim was going to the trail head to do a day hike and agreed to take me. The forecasted rain seemed unlikely and I said goodbye to Maria and the others.I only hiked 7 miles today, but crossed the 1,500 mile mark as well as I climbed Bear Mountain (the highest point in Connecticut). I ended the day just over the border into Massachusetts!At the top of Bear Mountain it was chilly. The elevation is 2,316 ( the highest we have been in a while I believe). The three days of rain really cooled things off and as I type this from my tent it's actually very chilly. Before I left Maria's Flashlight shared with me the forecast for this week... It's not supposed to get over 85 or so. In a weeks time I will be through Massachusetts and into Vermont! Have I seen the last of the blazing temperatures that three days ago seemed like they were never going to end? Only time will tell, but I am going to start my list of cold weather items to have Kelly send back to me right before New Hampshire.","Nuckear Lake

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545290,"I am in Vermont! I crossed into the Green Mountain State early yesterday morning after stopping short the night before.The terrain has changed from mellow and somewhat boring in Massachusetts to significant climbs. The climbs started in Massachusetts when we summit Mt. Grey lock (highest point in Mass). Another high light was Upper Goose Pond cabin. The cabin is ran by the ATC and hikers are allowed to stay in the cabin for free. In addition there are canoes and swimming. Feather and I each took out a canoe. We also swan. For dinner a trail angel cooked spaghetti and meatballs. In the morning before we hiked out we had a traditional pancake breakfast.I was able to do 17 miles yesterday before I came to Route 9 which runs into Bennington, VT. Being that I did 17 miles and it was 6 o'clock I decided to hitch into Bennington for a cold beer. I caught a ride with a dude named Bear. He was dropping a load of hikers off at the trail head and agreed to haul me back into town. He dropped me off at a place called Donavan's for one beer. It was a little sleepy in there so I went further into town looking for a tavern with food. There was a micro brewery like place that was crowded. I went in and Time Warp and Pine Apple Express texted me making their presence in town known. Soon they joined me at the bar followed shortly by Haiku.We ate and consumed several beers and then the subject of where to stay came up. Haiku mentioned that Robert Frost (poet) was buried in a graveyard in Bennington and he intended to go see the grave and stealth camp nearby. I am familiar with Robert Frost and like the ""Road Less Traveled"" so I took the road less traveled and headed to the cemetery with Haiku. Time Warp and Pine Apple Express came along for the ride.On the way to the cemetery we met some locals outside of the gas station. They warned us that rain was coming. Weirdly enough one of the locals reminded all of us of Hunter S. Thompson. With Hunter S's weather report we knew our stealth camping plan might end up with us getting wet. Pineapple Express gave us an out by pointing out a coffee shop that opened at 6 am... Out shelter from the storm!We made it to the cemetery and quickly found Robert Frost's grave (there were markets indicating where he was buried). Haiku read a Robert Frost poem (the one about gave many miles to travel before sleeping) and we respectfully left the area. We found an unoccupied space not to far away and cowboy camped under a big tree. Our loose plan was not to get too dug in (pun intended) and bolt when the rain started.At 5 minutes to 6 am rain drops started hitting my face. Time Warp was up fast and said ""let's go""! We all four jump up, packed what little we had out and hiked to the coffee shop. We were the first customers through the door... The walk was short but we already were wet.After we sat down and got out of our rain jackets we ordered breakfast and coffee. Outside the rain was coming down in heavy sheets.We sat there all morning. The rain finally stopped. Cake came up (she was caught in the rain on the trail and was soaked). Haiku took off with her to get a motel room and soon a lady offered us s ride to the trail head (rain now stopped). Time Warp and Pineapple Express took her up on the offer and left. I stayed to finish my 10th cup of coffee and then go eat lunch at a pizza place.After lunch I caught an easy hitch back to the trail head. There are many hikers at the head drying or trying to dry out. I hiked up the steep rise out of Route 9 and seemed to climb the rest of the day. The trail was very wet and muddy. I made it to the second shelter which is 10 miles from Route 9. I was reluctant to go further as it started misting again. The shelter is jammed packed with hikers tonight... Southbound, Northbound and VT Long Trail Hikers. It just got dark and already there is a snorer.","Massachuusetts border

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545940,"I am holed up at the Inn at Long Trail. I have been here since the kickoff of Dudefest 2 on Monday afternoon. By all accounts Dudefest 2 was a big success with a rough estimate of 100 hikers in attendance. I zeroed here yesterday which was well planned as a major wind/rain storm blew through last night! I was humbled that so many hikers would show up. I hiked into Kilington with Sky and Muwinn that last few days before the party and we shamelessly promoted the event along the way. Half way we started hearing a lot of noise from other hikers and we knew it would be well attended. Our thoughts were confirmed when Pretzel (a thru hiker Class of 2015) handed us cold Genesee Cream Ales at a cross road and further confirmed out estimates of hiker numbers. Pretzel would also show and he was kind enough to bring a group of northbounders who are some miles back to to the party. One hiker, Three Times, I had not seen since Kelly dropped me off after July 4th and I gave him a leftover cold Blue Moon beer.To get to Dudefest 2 I had to cover a lot of miles and I owe Sky and Muwinn a nod as they pushed me on Sunday. We covered 20 miles and did it the mellow way. We did not stop hiking until 10:30 at night. We thought we passed the shelter and stealthed camped in a four wheeler road bed next to a stream. In the morning when we woke up we realized we were 100 yards from the shelter!!! In the end setting up in the road was better. Shelters are packed because of rain and the number of sobo, nobo and Long Trail Hikers on the trail.Speaking of rain the night before I walked 2 miles in the dark in the driving rains Sky and Muwinn got out ahead agree our trail magic with Pretzel. I stayed with Time Warp and Greyhound and considered all options then launched off into the quickly darking woods. I passed Wanderer and Chicago setting up and when I saw them yesterday they said they were worried when I passed them that night as the rain and wind really kicked in. The reality was I came to the AT knowing I would have to rely upon my outdoor skills and I did that night. At one point I was worried I was off trail as there was so much water pouring down the trail looked liked a creek. A cooler head saved the day and when I arrived at the shelter I was relieved and very wet. I wish I could name all the characters that attended Dudefest 2, but I can't. Here are some....Haiku, Cake, Peace Foot, Sailor, Blue, C Sharp, Sky, Muwinn, Time Warp, Greyhound, Fireball, Pluto, I am Liquor, Sphagnum PI, Pineapple Express,Freemont, Wallet, Eagle, Lt. Dan, Jack Rabbitt, Lee, Frolic, Mace, Daddy Long Legs, 1%, Thanks Alot, Blade, Sarah Lee, Dutches, Tucan, Tri State, Pupply Mill, Karma, Sunshine, The Long Trail Kid, Nathan, Lazereth, Cyndi Loopers (2015), Pretzel. (2015), Miss Janett, Joy Ride (who certainly went for a joy ride at Dudefest 2), Hippie Toes...the list goes on. We are all excited to move forward into New Hampshire! I hope to make it to Hanover in a few days. Tri State, who is off trail, lives there and offered me his place. I look forward to the hike and cross my fingers it dries up. Kelly sent my cold weather gear to Hanover. This was the right choice as it is cooler. When we came over Mt. Kilington on Monday it was wet and cold up there... The kind of cold you feel when you first get off s ski lift ""at the top""! And we are in ski country. Funny, it's mid August and back home it's blazing.Sky, Muwinn and I hit the 500 miles to Katahdin sign the other night. It was surreal. I only have 500 miles (actually less now) until this amazing journal is over. I am going to cherish every step and I am having the time of my life!","Shelter

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548201,"First an apology to my followers. My updates on here have fallen way behind. I am currently in the Farm House Hostel in Rangeley, Maine and 220 miles from the northern terminus of the AT. There are many hikers in the area. It seems as if many are targeting a completion date on it around the end of September (which is 20 days away). I had to say goodbye to Sky, Muwin and Heizenburg the other day as their schedules to complete are shorter. This found me hiking alone out of Andover, Maine but I was not alone long as I soon met up with multiple familiar hikers.The attitude is positive although almost all hikers are admitting to feeling worn down. Our average daily miles have been low and the southern Maine terrain challenging.Yesterday as we hiked towards Rangeley an impromptu hiker sit-in occurred by a lake. Earlier in the hike one would have never seen a group of 10 hikers sitting around mid-day talking about their hike, but the time seemed right. Participating in the conversation was Hey Girl, Hatchet, DOC (Dude in Couch), Works Hard, Limey and a few others. The focus now is the 100 mile wilderness which is quickly approaching. We are finding out from southbounders that it's not exactly wildnerrness and rumors if trail magic have even circulating.Speaking of trail magic we stumbled into a great set up yesterday where a Maine couple (Bruce and Teddy) were cooking hamburgers and hot dogs on a road. This was especially nice as I was hungry and low on food. I ate two hamburgers, a hot dog and two tomatoes!!As I sit here and type this I am also visiting with Trek! Trek has flip flopped and is heading south. Trek was one of the first hikers I met in Georgia back at Hawk Mountain shelter when I started on April 5th. It is good to see him!","The Presidentials

Jake the Fake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549101,"I am chilling in Monson, Maine at Shaw's Hiker Hostel. The next step I take onto the AT will be into the 100 mile wilderness. I have 115 miles left to finish.With such a short distance to hike I decided to double zero here and rest my knees and visit with old friends and meet new ones. The 100 mile wilderness leads up to Mt. Katahdin and the northern terminus of the AT. We have been told not to underestimate this section. That being the case I spent most of the day going over my supplies and packing my backpack for the grand finale. I have been warned there is little reception in the wilderness so my updates may be sporadic. I will attempt to keep everyone up to speed on my summit day (goal is Sept 28). Kelly is coming on the 29th to Millenocket/Baxter State Park to get me. I am very fortunate to have such a positive spouse that has been behind my journey the entire way.

To say the hike was epic would be an understatement. I do wish I was able to keep up with daily blog entries, but that did not happen.I summited on a beautiful day with several other thru-hikers.
