Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529838,"I'm 66. I plan to thru hike the A/T starting 8/1/16 through early November from Port Clinton, PA to Springer. Then on 4/1/17 through no later than 7/31/17 I will again start from Port Clinton, PA through to Katahdin, ME. I've done several section hikes on the A/T and in October, 2012 with my daughter, ascended to Mt. Everest base camp in Nepal.",,Springer and Katahdin ,"Jun 22, Wed",0
Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541956,"I initially prepared a day by day itinerary showing day #, Location, location features; eg., hostel/motel, shuttles, resupply, water, shower, laundry,fuel,distance to town, planned daily & cumulative trail miles,actual/cumulative/variance from plan trail miles. This comparison is critical for a thru hiker since it dictates pace including when to take zero days, and likelihood of reaching your ultimate goal.My itinerary notes if hostels, resupply sources, shuttles, etc are set up on my cellphone. Most are. This avoids having to look at AT guide for info thereby saving time and phone power.Calls have been made to various hostels and resupply points to ensure they will be open and stock what I need, thereby avoiding an unnecessary trek sometime 2 to 4 miles from trail to off-trail destination. Where available and depending upon distance to these points a shuttle will be contacted in advance.",,Planning,"Jul 13, Wed",0
Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542714,I started listing gear under the Gear tab. More will be added. I'd like to go light as I can but I'll start out with 41 lbs including a 5 day food supply and 4 liters of water. I'm leery of PA water sources having had experienced it before otherwise I would start with about 2 to 3 liters water. I feel better thinking the weight goes down as the days go by about 3 lbs/ day as food and water get depleted.,,Planning,"Jul 18, Mon",0
Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543544,"Last few days been spending a lot of time reviewing my daily itinerary, making changes when necessary. For example, the AT Conservancy (ATC) periodically posts trail updates. I make these changes to my itinerary. I've been making many phone calls to various hostels, B&B's and resupply points to ensure they will be open during the time frame specified and carry the food and gear items I need. I also call shuttle operators in remote areas where a ride is needed to towns off the trail by more than 1 mile. They cannot always be relied upon so alternatives are planned. Many hostels provide shuttles to and from trail-heads for free or a small fee.","Planning

Bigfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543767,"Interesting discussion with Smoky Mtn Park official regarding bear issues.   He said since there are 2 bears per sq mile in Smokies if proper precautions are not taken, confrontations can occur more than most places. His advice is to not only use bear cables for suspending food out of reach of bears, but to suspend your entire pack. Reason is that certain bears from prior experiences associate the look of a backpack with an opportunity for food or other goodies. Latent scents from food bags stored in your pack can be easily sensed by a bear so the backpack alone is very inviting and often is ransacked. This is very problematic if backpack is stored in your tent or nearby. IF cables are full with other equipment from other campers, the roipe method on the tree 10 ft up and 6 ft out is the alternative.","Food selection
