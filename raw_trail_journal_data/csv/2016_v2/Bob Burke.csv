Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522824,"I have an amazing job, wonderful friends and family. For quite some time I have wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail. After a life change, it popped into my head that perhaps this was the right time to hike the trail. I asked my supervisor about the possibility for a leave of absence. Based on our conversation, I was hopeful, but still believed the possibility of a leave to be remote. Low and behold, a week ago I received word that my leave of absence had been approved. I was ecstatic! At 44 years old, I am going to hike the AT!Of course, then all of the questions come about. Why do you want to do that? How are you going to make money? Isn't that too long a hike? Can't you just hike for a few weeks? Are you really going to do it? And on and on and on. Then there is the feeling of the dog who just caught the truck. I plan to start around April 20th. I need to put all of my belongings in storage, get out of my place, and finish my taxes! If only one person on Earth could find me on the AT, I have no doubt it would be the friendly, local IRS agent. And I do want to finish my hike this year! Now after listening to half of AWOL's book on the trail, I have my own self doubts. I really haven't been training for a hike. What the heck am I going to eat? And is that a twinge I just felt in my knee? How about my foot?The one thing I have going for me is that I do occasionally have a stubborn streak when my mind is made up. I have taken on the mind set that I will not quit unless I am physically unable to continue for weeks.More later.....",,Deciding to Hike,"Mar 07, Mon",0
Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523964,"I am normally in pretty fair shape. However, as soon as my leave was granted, I knew I was not in trail condition. I had hiked the Grand Canyon in February and my IT Band really flared up. That was a fantastic hike by the way. Then I read AWOL's book and it confirmed I needed to get in trail shape.The problem with only having a month to prepare, is being torn in a bunch of different directions. Preparing to move out of my place and put all of my belongings in storage. Ordering food items, etc. Figuring out what I am doing on this through hike. Get in shape! Yes that.I worked with my chiropractor and he gave me some exercises to deal with the IT Band. Then I have been upping my mileage, pack weight, and vertical. The up is great for conditioning. The down for testing my knee. Trekking poles are a life saver.My training area is South Mountain Park in Phoenix. I live only a few minutes from the Warpaint trailhead. Phoenix is marvelous this time of year. The weather has been in the 60's to high 70's. Today was actually a little too hot at 88! The park is large enough that in many places you really feel like you are out in the desert. I am definitely gaining confidence in my conditioning and my tricky right knee.",,Training For The Big Hike,"Mar 18, Fri",0
Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524609,"I work for an incredible company. They are allowing me to take six months off without pay to achieve my dream of hiking the Appalachian Trail. While I have always appreciated my employer, words cannot express how grateful I am to Southwest Airlines to have the time off to heal and grow. Pilots are salaried employees. We get paid, generally speaking, by how much we fly. We are regulated by the FAA on how much we can fly. Right now, I have been flying right up to the maximum to save money for my big trip.   It is really great financially, but not as good for training. It also means that I have to schedule all of my packing, moving, and travel around my flying. As a result, I am not going to pack many food boxes. I think I am mostly going to subside on whatever I can find in the stores and gas stations along the way. This may turn out out to be OK and it may be a disaster. Who can say?   I have promised myself that I will not quit unless I suffer some kind of traumatic injury along the trail. So from Newark, NJ, have a good evening!",,Working to hike,"Mar 23, Wed",0
Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526934,"It is interesting. If you asked me 3 months ago if I ever thought I might move belongings back in with my parents, I would tell you there is no possible way. I am sure my folks would say the same thing! But, here I am, driving my awesome car to Idaho with a load of camping gear and all that I will ever need for the next 6 months.",,Back to Idaho,"Apr 07, Thu",0
Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526932,"I am very excited to head out on my hike. However, it was also sobering to move out of my place and put all that I own in two storage units. It is a lot of work! However, it is also somewhat of a metaphor for this whole hike. I am storing nearly all of my worldly belongings and will do with what I can carry on my back. Likewise, I am giving up the comfort and companionship of many dear friends and family to take to the trail for six months. I will miss those whom I care about much more than the ""stuff"". Of course, I will miss my comfy bed pretty darn much! The unfortunate by-product of working a ton and packing up my place is that I have not had much of a chance to stay out on my training hikes. I am a little concerned about that. However, we all must play the hand we are dealt and I don't plan on folding!",,"Coeur d'Alene, Idaho","Apr 08, Fri",0
Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527382,"So, quite a few people have asked me about the gear I am bringing with me on my trip. I have good gear. Most of it is pretty light. I definitely would not classify it as ultralight. What I can say is that it all works for me. I am confident in my gear, even though it is a little more than I would like to be carrying.

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528079,"Before I hit the trail, I wanted to come to Detroit to visit my brother and his family. My folks also decided to make the journey to Detroit.   It was a really great time, and I'm glad I made the trip.My brother's kids are really great. It was fun to see them and do fun things like tea parties, etc. Every time I visit my brother, I always gain the highest respect for all of you parents out there. As good as his kids are, they are busy and things are always in motion. I am exhausted! It was so worth it!I also helped my brother move some things into his new place. It is going to a super nice home.I finally got all of my stuff packed and some supplies sent. I think it will be enough and the right items. If not, I will learn and adapt. I leave early tomorrow morning for Atlanta. I am very excited!",,Visiting Family Before the Trek,"Apr 15, Fri",0
Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528262,"Today I traveled from Detroit to the Hiker Hostel in Dahlonega, Georgia. It was a great day. I started the day not quite knowing what to expect. I am finishing the day ready to hike. I got up very early and my parents and my brother were nice enough to drive me to the airport. My flight on Southwest was punctual and smooth as usual.  Since I got in a bit early and I had time to kill before I needed to head up north, I treated myself to breakfast at the IHOP in the Atlanta Hartsfield Airport. It was satisfactory. I then took the MARTA to the north station. The Atlanta transit system was very easy to use.   I met several hikers waiting to be picked up at the station. A few minutes later Chief came and picked us up. We had a great visit while he drove us to the hiker hostel. Chris, a fellow through hiker, Heard that there was a festival in town. We confirmed that there was! It was the Bear in the Square festival. So, 20 years ago a bear wandered into town, climbed a tree in front of the courthouse, and stayed there for a couple of days. For the past 20 years, they have been celebrating the tree climbing bear.   The festival is a merger of food and bluegrass music. It was most enjoyable! I even bought a T-shirt. Of course I mailed that home.    All in all, a very fun and eventful first day in Georgia!",,Travel to the Hiker Hostel,"Apr 16, Sat",0
Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528594,"So, Today was my first day on the trail. It was one of the most special days of my life! After a good breakfast at the Hiker Hostel, Josh drove 6 of us to Amicalola State park. 6 went with Chief to Springer Mountain.   After a few pictures, I started my hike up by the waterfall. It was exceedingly pretty. I made a very good decision to let Endless and Mike get ahead. Those guys are fast and it would have killed me to keep up. The weather was perfect! Cool and clear in the morning and low 70's for the high. The trees in the higher elevations were just budding which allowed views of the valleys below, which were so pretty. I met a lot of interesting folks along the way. I hiked a ways with Jake, Seth, and Linda. Crossed paths with Alex. I met Bob and his wife at the top of Springer Mountain. Met Joe and Roxanne (cool Army folk), and ended up at the Stover Shelter. There I met Captain Caveman, William, Dustin, Mojo and her dog Zinga, and some of the aforementioned folks. I arrived at the Stover shelter at about 4pm. The competitive side of me said to hike on. The practical side said to stop at 11.5 for the day and call it good. I stopped feeling pretty good, feet good, and knees pretty good. I ate a big dinner and really enjoyed feeding Zinga, too. We all talked about literature and told funny stories. Some funnier than others. There was a lot of drama to see whether Mojo would burn her stuff down, and the shelter for that matter, with her new alcohol stove. Then it was time to turn in. It stays light pretty late here. 8:30 or so and that helps. Day one in the books. It was a good one!","Amicalola State Park

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528614,"So day 2. So there was drama at the shelter during the night. There was a bit of room for Mojo and Zinga in shelter next to CAPT Caveman. He said he didn't mind as long as the dog didn't get in his sleeping bag. You know where this is going. The CAPT got up for a quick break and Zinga dive into his bag. He went to get in and there is this thing in his bag! He dealt with it with grace.I started hiking at 8:15 and it was such a pretty morning! There was not a cloud in the sky and it was cool and clear. Walking was wonderful! I really enjoyed it. The first part of the trail was a gentle downhill through a rhododendron forest. Eventually, I came to Long Creek Falls. They were very pretty! I snapped a few photos.I passed Captain caveman and we talked for a bit. Frank is a great guy! Later, I ran into William. I saw Dustin again at the Hawk Mountain Shelter when I stopped for lunch. He is trying to become the first person to suffer a cardiac arrest to finish the Appalachian Trail! Wow! We visited with a couple of section hikers who were very nice. A guy named Andrew and three of his younger friends were just pulling in. Andrew had one cool mustache and beard!The climb up to Sassafras Mountain was pretty steep. There I met quite a few people. I meant Scarebear, Frog, Yup Yup, and Mo and Tiho. Mo is from Belgium and Tiho is from the Netherlands. I also caught up with Alex and walked with him for a bit. I was getting a little short of water when I arrived at Justus Creek. I filled up and soaked my feet for a while. I also washed out my hat and shirt. I joked with everyone that it made the water smell bad! There I met three nice section hikers from Kankakee, IL. They were fun to talk to. I also met another Alex and Maggie from Naples, FL. I told Florida Alex that his trail name should be hair. He had a lot of it and it look like he just came off tour with a big time band.I walked on, and eventually came to the Gooch Gap Shelter. There I caught up with some of the folks that I had stayed at the hostel with the first night. Mike said that Endless had gone over 20 miles day one. We both agreed we were only going to see him again on his blog. That confirmed my instincts to take it easy day one. I also saw the super nice family that jetted ahead of me day one. Sydney, the kiddo had taken Hummingbird for a trail name. They are section hiking and I hope to catch up with them in Vermont. I met another Mike, Scott and Blue Eyes, and another former Army guy who was fun to talk to. I want to say Brendon, but not sure. I made the tough decision to hike on to Gooch Gap for the night. It was 1.4 miles and I was feeling really good, the shelter was crowded, and I hoped to get a mile closer to Neel Gap. There I want to pick up my mailed supplies and get a hot shower. Anybody who knows me, knows that I will miss hot showers the most in the zombie apocalypse! I am motivated to get to Neels gap!When I arrived at Gooch Gap, I saw Tiho and Mo camped out. I saw a primo site across the road, but it looked like a happy couple was over there, too. I decided to join the guys and we had a great visit. Mo is a pastry Chef and Tiho is about to go for his master's degree. They have to finish in four months so they are turning and burning. With Mo being a chef, I must say I am a little envious of their homemade freeze dried food! I finished hiking around 6 and this is the first connection I have had. Very nice to have!Feeling good. Feet are good! Legs are a little tired. Not sore yet tonight. Good! Gear good, but may send back my camp chair. Time for bed. I'm beat!","Stover Creek Shelter
",Gooch Gap,"Apr 18, Mon",14.40
Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528811,"Day 3. It was a big one! I got up and took my oatmeal. Not long after, people from the previous shelter started walking by. They were getting an early start! Right as I was packing up, Goose, Hummingbird, and Beth walked by. They said I need to get an earlier start. True. I walked with them for a while and we had a great visit! They are fast walkers. Hummingbird, who is 11 sets the pace and they finished an hour and a half before I did. Now I did soak my feet for a while in the stream. So, this is how it kind of works on the trail. There are certain places to get water and take a break. At these places, everyone tends to congregate. Everyone starts the day in relatively close proximity. However, over the day, the fast walkers tend to get father ahead and the slower walkers arrive at shelters a little later. I am a medium paced hiker. For example, Kevin, aka Matt Damon arrived three. The Vermonters 3:30. Mo and Tiho 4:30. Mike and I 5:00. Blue eyes, Alex, Dustin, Howl, and Tom at 7:00. Today I leaned that Tom from and Rob from Baltimore are Uncle and nephew. We were at the soaking stream. Since Rob has the oriole hat, I am pushing them to be Baltimore and Oriole.    Sure it's corny, but I think it works!We had a couple big climbs today. Pilot Mountain and Blood Mountain were a lot of work. Blood mountain is the highest mountain on the Appalachian Trail in Georgia. The crazy thing is, the trail went down, down, down just before the mountains so then we had to go up, up up. I was hiking with Mike on the way up blood mountain. We did really well. The views were really great! Arriving at Neel's gap was really super! The Vermonters were just getting in a car to take them back to the hiker hostel as they have to go back to school. It was Great to be able to say goodbye. Matt Damon was here, so he showed us where the bunks were and helped us get situated. That was super nice! I ate a pizza, and then some nice folks brought homemade lasagna and salad. I ate a second dinner. It was really great! My shower felt phenomenal! So today was a little over 14 miles, but the most elevation gain and loss of the hike so far. The hike down blood mountain was the hardest stretch so far. Overall, I am tired, but feel pretty good. My feet are a little tired, and my neck is sunburned, but other than those two things, I am in really good shape! No blisters so far. Very thankful and fortunate. All right, time for bed!","Gooch Gap

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529117,"Day 4. Got a later start today. Slept in until 7 and was pretty much ready to go, but waited for some of my friends. I was waiting for Mike to buy some stuff, but then we also waited for Kelsey, formerly Blue Eyes. She sent back 30 pounds out of her pack. Her pack weight went from 50 to 20! That is an Appalachian Trail record for 2016. I sent back my camp chair, and my extra shorts, shirt, and hiking socks. It saved me two pounds. I have resigned myself to smelling bad. However, my pack weight actually went up. People were giving up tasty granola and candy bars along with peanut butter and Nutella packets to lighten their loads. Yum! I fit in as many as my food bag would allow after keeping all of my new stuff. We rolled out about 11 am hoping to make it 11 miles to Low Gap. We had a really fun group! Matt Damon, Mike, Dustin now Braveheart, Kelsey, Andrea now Trailblazer, and Naomi now Lobster. Naomi and her husband are moving to Moscow, ID. She is going to go to the UI Law Program. He is finishing as an Army Medic and will work on a degree in a related field. We had a nice visit. He gave Naomi lessons on how to help us in case we were impaled or had sucking chest wounds. OK. Moving on. The terrain was not quite as steep as yesterday so we were able to make good time. My right ankle got a little sore about 7 miles in. I plowed through and it is not a serious issue, but I am keeping a close eye on it. Otherwise, my feet are a little tired, but all else is well. We rolled into camp before 5 and ran into Caitlyn from the hostel - now Teddy as she is carrying her teddy with her, Skittles, a young 23 year old sub teacher who died her hair the primary colors, Mobly, Brandon, Baltimore and Oriole. B&O hate those names and retaliated by calling me tater. I love potatoes in pretty much all forms and to me a tater is tasty! So I had no issue with it. A guy named Mustard Seed and his dog Rose were here. He hiked the Florida Trail this winter en route to the AT. He told us about all the gators and such that they dogged enroute to Georgia. At one point the trail was so flooded, he hooked empty water bottles to Rose to float her through the mangroves while he waded and pushed her through. Rose is a very sweet dog! I think that is too much even for me!So today is 4/20. To me it is the day my Leave of Absence went active. To others on the trail, it was cause for ""Safety Meetings"". I will honestly admit this is the first time I have been even close to folks smoking. It is not my thing as I am fine without it. I also value my job!! It certainly made for interesting conversation after it was confirmed all were appropriately safe. I don't really care as long as nobody tries to pet a bear or some silly thing like that. Trying to get an early start. Good night!","Neel's Gap
",Low Gap,"Apr 20, Wed",11.50
Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529120,"Day 5. Low Gap to Tray Mountain Shelter. Set my alarm and got up at 6 AM. Slept pretty well last night all in all. It still took me an hour and 25 minutes to get out of camp. For some reason, I am in slow motion first thing in the morning. Getting out of camp at 7:25 in the morning was still 50 minutes earlier than my previous best! I have to look at the positive side of things.Mike left first. After an hour, Matt Damon and I caught up to him. We were able to make it 11 miles to Unicoi Gap by noon. There, Matt Damon decided to head into town with two hikers from Florida that we caught up to name Matt and Brynn. We were also the recipients of trail magic! Someone left jugs of spring water at the AT sign at U. Gap. Mike and I decided to press on to Tray Mountain shelter. The next 5 miles where the toughest so far. A lot of up and down. The forecast was for thunderstorms and showers at 4 o'clock. We made it to the shelter at 3:30. We were whooped! We got the last two spots in the shelter so everyone that arrived after had to tent.The shelter became a pretty lively place as everyone else had the same idea that we did. Also, it is a natural break point for folks heading to Dick's gap and then Hiawassee Georgia tomorrow. I took pictures of most of the folks here at the shelter. One of the folks I missed was Bosephus(Bo). He had never been camping before and came out with his Green Beret buddy. Unfortunately, the buddy got sick he came on his own. So, his pack weighed 70 pounds to start with including his computer. At Neels gap, he trimmed it down to 50 pounds and is ecstatic! He still has the computer...... My ankle was sore this morning, and then got better. However the last 5 miles it really hurt! Tomorrow will be a much easier day. Just 11 miles and easier terrain. I plan to split a hotel room with Mike or Braveheart and rest my ankle, take a shower, wash my clothes, have a pizza, and a beer! Supposed to rain all night, so we shall see what the weather really turns out to be.","Low Gap
",Tray Mountain Shelter,"Apr 21, Thu",15.60
Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529367,"Day 6 Tray Mountain Shelter to Hiawasse, GA. A big storm came through last night. Despite being in the shelter, we all got wet as the wind blew the rain straight in. In the process of trying to get everything back from the entrance, I lost track of my ear plugs. I wrapped my rain jacket around the bottom of my quilt and that worked well enough. As everyone else fell asleep, there was some serious snoring going on. At one point I actually recorded it. Bo was loudest, but stopped after a while. However, for hours, Baltimore and Oriole snored like a well rehearsed band. As tired as I was, it was impressive. I got up at 0130 to take a break. It was so foggy that I had a difficult time finding my way back from the outhouse. The good news is that my earplugs were in my puffy coat jacket. I could sleep after that! Got up about 6 and Mike and I departed at 7:18. Everything is harder in the rain. It is a struggle to pack everything up and keep gear dry. The rained did green everything up and it was beautiful. We caught up to Bo after an hour and had a great visit with him. Harold ""Bosephus"" Moore is quite a good athlete for a guy I'm guessing to be around 50. Carrying 50 lbs, he was really moving well. We talked about expectations at one point. He noted the key to a lot of things in life is low expectations. So true. Unmet Expectations are future resentments. Bo was tapping out at Dicks Creek and a friend was to pick him up at 1pm.We made great time despite the weather and made it to Dicks Creek Gap at 11:45. Mike and tried to hitch into town for 45 minutes. Finally, Bo's friend showed up and Bo was nice enough to give us a ride into Hiawasse in his Mercedes. The heated rear seats were so nice and we were so thankful for a ride into town. Matt Damon had already made into town and had a room for us at the Budget Inn. It is a hotel mostly dedicated to hikers. We chatted with a few other hikers and grabbed some barbecue. I bought a compression thing for my ankle and iced it. I showered, did laundry, and cleaned my gear. The shower felt so good! We then went to All U Can eat pizza. That was good. The day went so fast! Tomorrow, I am going to go to the grocery store to get a few little things for the next three days. Then I am going to hit the trail.","Tray Mountain Shelter
",Dicks Gap,"Apr 22, Fri",11
Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529774,"Last night I slept the best that I had since Idaho. The guys I split the room with said I snored louder than they thought humanly possible and then I quieted down for the rest of the night. When I stopped snoring, they were a little worried I had expired. We got a good laugh about that. After 10 hours of glorious sleep, I took another shower. Two days in a row and commenced packing. When the other guys were ready, we headed up to the local grocery which had an indoor Starbucks. I ordered a nice coffee and bought the guys bagels and cream cheese. The deli lady was super nice and toasted them for us. We each ordered deli sandwiches as well. I saved mine for dinner tonight and it was so, so good! They also had homemade honey roasted peanut butter. I had to have some. As it was heavy, the guys asked if I was going to carry it. I told them, ""Heck Yeah!"" The grocery was a huge success. We headed back to the Budget and packed up the rest of our stuff. We made the 11 van to the trail. I went to put on my seat belt and not one was installed. A far cry from the Mercedes on the way to town!! On the van was Mike, Matt Damon, Altman, Lost Hiker and his dog, Wild Man Dan, Benji, and a strange guy from Switzerland. When we got to the trailhead, a Church group was serving hot dogs. As I had already eaten and was fresh from the hotel, I decided to get going with my walk. Today was mostly up. Over four thousand feet of elevation gain. I thought Sassafras Mountain was the toughest hill yet due to the grade. The big news is we passed from Georgia into North Carolina! One State down, 12 to go. We made it to Muscrat Creek about 5:30 doing 12 miles in 6 hours. Not bad. We decided to tent and got dandy spots by the stream. It sounds very nice. We watched the sunset and it was magnificent. My ankle is doing better. A couple of easy days combined with icing in town and cold soaking has helped. I think the compression bandage helped as well. Perhaps the biggest key has been better stretching my calf muscles with were very tight and burdening the ankles. After a week on the trail, this has been one of better days. Really enjoyed it. Tomorrow will be longer, but not as challenging vertically. Hope to be in Franklin on Monday evening.","Dicks Gap
",Muscrat Creek Shelter,"Apr 23, Sat",12
Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529775,"So Day 8. Muscrat Creek to Long Branch Shelter. A big day of hiking! I did not sleep well last night. I tossed and turned a lot. As usual, I was in my deepest sleep when the alarm went off at 6:01. I noticed right off, it was the coldest night I had spent outside temperature wise. I was pretty much ready to go by 0730, but Matt Damon was not to be roused and Mike was not ready. I waited for Mike for a while, but finally told him I was taking off at 0755 as I was freezing!! The trail was super nice. Gentle ups and downs. I caught up with Not Yet. He is from St Augustine and wants to be a nurse. I walked with a big guy whose trail name is Teddy. He is a bit older and had hiked almost all of the trail previously, but had to drop out due to injury. I passed Lucky No. 7. The seventh child in his family. Eventually, I caught up to Kelsey, who I thought was miles behind! Turns out she was a trombone performance major when she was in college. We talked music to the top of Standing Indian Mt. Mike caught us as we were grabbing a bite. Mike and I walked for a few miles and then soaked our feet in a stream. It felt nice.Mike's feet were really hurting him. He said to press on and I did. I cruised to Carter Gap Shelter, had a quick bite, and met Notebook, who also was suffering from a foot malady. She thought she might end up at Betty's Creek as well and I told her about my friends who would show up shortly.   After a few minutes, I met Montechristo. He is from Mexico and friends with Notebook. An older couple I met going Southbound encouraged me to continue over Albert Mountain to the Long Branch shelter. It was an extra 5 Miles, but they were convincing. The last bit up Albert mountain is straight up. At the top is a fire watch tower with spectacular views. I climbed up the tower as far as possible and took in the views. There I met Hikemoore, Honeybadger, Bear Burrito, and Grasshopper. Honeybadger is a way cool guy. I liked him right off. At the tower, we went over MM 100 of the AT! 21 more 100's to go.....After the short two mile walk to the shelter, I met a bunch of other folks. Tumbleweed and her brother Brian, Florida Keys and Hawaii, two older adventurous sisters, Don Juan, Cody and Derrick, who both just got out of the Navy, Giggles from England. These are all folks who had started earlier than I had and as such, I knew none of them. I was pretty used to running with my group and usually knew at least someone at a shelter. With the bigger day, this was not the case. It took a few minutes to break into the group. They all seem to be nice and I am glad I got to know them!My ankle hurt a little at the start, but after plenty of stretching and miles, it got better as the day went on. Soaking it in the middle and at the end of the day helped as well. I also worked on my walking mechanics a little. This also helped. So, I feel pretty good. Tired, but glad I only have to walk 7 miles to get to the road to town. I am going to get a room, resupply, eat a big meal and get some rest! The weather was ideal! The trail was pretty soft. As nice as any trail you could find in many places. That's it for now.","Muscrat Creek Shelter

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530036,"So Day 9, I don't like sleeping in the shelter. There is always all kinds of hustle and bustle, both in the morning and in the evening. This morning, I got up about 630 and left about eight. I hiked the first couple of miles with Derrick, my fellow Idahoan. His family is from Eagle. He is hoping to work for Google for a year, and then go to Purdue. I wished him the best of luck!Derek, and some other folks at the shelter the previous night were heading to Rockgap to get into town. I decided to continue to Winding Staircase Gap. It was a good decision for me. I got there at 1040 and met Dusty, Sunshine, and Maria. The van from the Budget Inn pulled up and we all piled in. The drive to town was very picturesque. Franklin is a pretty mountain town. It has a cute Main Street And the folks are very nice. I met Energizer, and we hiked down to the food truck to get a bite to eat. I got a burger with fresh cut fries and it was delicious! I went back to hotel and ice my ankle. It is feeling better. I tried to get an appointment with the doctor, but he was at another county today. So, Mike, Matt Damon, and Kelsi arrived and we decided to go to the grocery store instead.   We learned that Matt Damon was quitting the trail. I was very sad as he was a very fun guy to hike with. Good luck Kevin on your journey to San Diego.  After the grocery store, Mike wanted to go to Mulligan's for dinner. He really wanted a big burger. I told him I thought the food truck would be a better bet. Unfortunately, he was not to be persuaded.   So, you ordered a hamburger steak. Out came a block of meat that look like a meatloaf. The poor guy has been dreaming of and striking out everywhere with his quest for a juicy hamburger. After dinner, we changed into our rain gear and put in a load of laundry. Nobody wanted to put their clothes in first, because they saw what the last budget inn washer did to my shirt. I could be a priest my shirt is so holy. Eventually, somebody gave in and we all sat out in front of our rooms waiting for something, anything, to happen. there were probably 8 or so hikers out and we just told funny stories about folks we had seen. For example, Kelsi relayed a story of Baker16. He had an extended safety meeting and becalme paranoid of the bears. He hung his bear bag 300 yards out of camp and then pitched his tent under someone else's bear bag. Then he wandered incoherently in the rain storm. Baker16 was just a little too safe. The laundry finished and to my relief, my clothes escaped unscathed. Unfortunately for Mike, he is now a member of the cloth. Then it was time for bed. Around 9pm, hikers all head to bed and last night was no exception. It was a good day.","Long Branch Shelter

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530209,"Today was a good day! I had breakfast at the Country Kitchen with Alex and Maggie. Then Spoon Man was nice enough to drive me to the doctor to get my ankle checked out. They had two people look at it. The good news is I do not have a stress fracture! They also said that it was good news that it was healing before I came in to see them. My ankle showed the symptoms of a mild, high ankle sprain. They gave me a band, exercises and stretches, and sent me on my way. Very happy!I then went back and told the folks at the Budget Inn. They were happy for me. Then I set about to do errands around town. I bought more food to send to Fontana Dam. I also decided to change my cook method. I am now going for foods that I do not have to cook at all. I bought a little bigger stand alone pot and am changing to a different water filtration system. I bought some new shoes that should provide better support to my ankle. Hope they work. So, I walked to Mexican food with Benji, Hoot and Pad Foot, and Big Teddy. We saw some other folks there and joined up. It was pretty good. The place got packed! I was amazed.When I got back everyone was on their porches. Grits, from Georgia, was all happy as Benji had bought him a nice cigar that that he had been jonesing. Atman was there, Focus, Rest Stop, and Hot Pants - eccentric Swiss dude who wears jeans. We all visited for a few minutes. Turns out Focus and Rest Stop are hiking the AT together. They have both finished the PCT and the CDT. Wow! I had to take care of my room explosion and headed in for the night. A good, happy, day all in all.One other thing. Hanging out in town and not hiking is referred to by hikers as taking a ""zero"" because you are not hiking any AT miles. The comforts of civilization can be really nice and it is easy to get sucked in. However, as nice as the hotel bed and shower are, I am ready to get back on the trail!","Winding Stair Gap (Franklin, NC)

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530349,"Day 12. Today was a good day all in all. I woke up and had breakfast at the Country Kitchen. It was great as usual. Then I made my way back to the Budget Inn to try and get my gear back into my pack. As I returned, the regular gang was sitting out on the porch. Normalcy. I was successful at getting my stuff back in the pack, but it was a struggle. I could not figure out how I got all that stuff into my pack like before.....I walked up to mail my old shoes and stove home and mail food forward to Fontana Dam. My food forward weighed 13 pounds. Yikes! They had to get a bigger box. The guy at the desk said that is a lot of food. It may be, but I am so happy with all that I bought and there is no way I would consider parting with my Nutter Butters - the heaviest item. Pretty soon it was time to head out to the trail. The van ride out was exceedingly pretty. It was a little hard getting back into the swing of hiking. It was like my body forgot what it was supposed to do. I walked with Derrick from Idaho and Cody from Oregon until lunch. We had lunch on Siler Bald. It was quite a view. I decided to strike out on my own and was overtaken by Karl and Elisha. They were both just out of college and full of energy. Elisha is from Taos, NM, and went to Vasser. Very cool. It is kind of strange walking with youngen's who could be my kids. So Elisha asked if one of the flowering trees was a dogwood. I said it was and you could tell by its bark. I finally said haha and they finally got it. Kids these days! I took a break to let them get ahead and then made it to the top of Wyah Bald. What a view from up there. Of course it was a clear day and the NC Mountains are so pretty in the spring. There I caught up with Atman, Benji, Grits, and Rook. We headed down to the shelter and made camp, had dinner and exchanged some laughs. Teddy Bear and Teddy and her hubby were at the shelter. So was Skittles. They decided I needed to get a dog and name it Jay. That way I could be PB & Jay. We all got a good laugh out of that! Not a laughing matter is Hoot hurt his knee and it won't bend. We all offered him what medicine we had and hope something works. He is a super nice guy and of course Pad Foot is a bit worried. As for me, my feet are a little sore in the new shoes, but all body parts are getting back to normal, knee included. So that's it for an eventful day 12.","Winding Stair Gap (Franklin, NC)

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530554,"Day 13. Some Days on the AT are easier than others. Today, I had amazing views to keep me going. Some of the best so far. However, I also walked the wrong way for a 1/4 mile before figuring out I went the wrong way. Rook and Atman said they also almost went the wrong way, but were saved by folks at the camp site. Good lesson. Much worse is that my new shoes gave me a big blister on my left ankle. I was a little ticked as that is the first blister I have had hiking in years. I put on Moleskin to try and stem the blister, but it was to no effect. If the shoes do not improve, I may have my folks FedEx my old shoes back to me down the road. The good news is my ankle is doing great. I called in a fire when I climbed to the top of Rocky Bald. I had reception for a few minutes and saw the fire. I called 911 and they had a tough time figuring out where I was calling from and where I was trying to tell them the fire was located. Hopefully, it was a controlled burn or previously reported. Walked with Atman, Rook, and Skittles for just a few minutes. I also met Storm. We were the lucky recipients of trail magic today! Someone left little Cokes and hostess donuts in a cooler. I had one of each. They were so, so, good!I am going to turn in early and get going earlier tomorrow.","Wyah Bald Shelter

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530699,"Today was a banner day! Some days are just better than others and this was one! I woke up earlier than I had been and was out of camp by 7:30. Funny story. I had washed out my shirt and hung it to dry overnight. When I woke, it was on the ground and a mouse had eaten a ton of holes in the side. Bummer! It was a very muggy morning and I sweated through my newly ventilated shirt. I made the 6 mile walk to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) by 10:00. I heard they had a pretty good restaurant and I was so hungry for pancakes! I ran in the door and they quickly showed me to the patio with some of the other hikers. I ordered the biggest breakfast available and it did not disappoint! I dined with Chad, Ocho, and Charlemagne. We laughed a lot. The new shoes had given me three pretty tough blisters so I walked over to the outfitter to see about shoes. I was in luck as they had one pair of my old shoes in stock and it was my size! I was elated. I then sent back the other shoes to Franklin for a refund. A bunch of the gang had gathered at the general store across the street and I mosied over to visit. We all had some good laughs. They all got a kick out of my shirt! The NOC is great! They have zip lining, a railroad, and river rafting. It would be easy to spend several days there. However, since I took several zeroes in Franklin, I just couldn't stay. The AT crosses the river and I ran into Teddy and her husband Travis. They are a cute couple. Travis has to go back to Arizona for work, so they had rented a car and were going to enjoy a few days together. Teddy is a strong hiker, so I am sure I will see her down the road. The climb from the NOC to Sassafras Shelter is amazing. Almost four thousand feet in 6 miles. That is over half the Grand Canyon! I ran into Dusty, Maria, and Lost on the way up. Also Monkey Leg and Tiny. They had pizza and beer before starting the climb and it showed!!It started to rain on and off when I arrived at the shelter. Due to the impending thunderstorm, everyone was shooting for it. I met up with a lot of folks who I had known previously and it was like old times. Teddy Bear, Curry Toe, Hawaii and Florida Keys, Looker, Bear Burrito, Montechristo, and the others I passed. Fortunately it is a big shelter that sleeps 12 in two decks. As I am tall, I took the upper deck. For dinner, I had Idahoan instant potatoes with gravy and tuna fish. It was my best dinner in 3 days! We all exchanged meal ideas as Curry Toe has gone stoveless as well. Bear Burrito had a ball to massage muscles and loaned that to me. Boy did that feel good. With the rain came a cold front. The temperature really dropped and everyone decided to turn in early. I learned a couple of items. The Quaker Breakfast Oatmeal Bars are just OK. But with peanut butter, they are good! Next, I bought Reese's Peanut Butter for a premium thinking it would taste like peanut butter cup peanut butter. The best!! When it tasted like regular peanut butter, I was irritated. Next time it's Peter Pan. Today was a great day. I was finally used to being back on the trail and returning to my other shoes was great! I saw a bunch of old friends and that was nice too. When I got laid up in Franklin and Matt Damon quit the trail, it did make me a little sad. It also bummed me out that Hoot and Pad Foot were probably done. It is amazing how attached to our friends we become. Just like real life, there are good days and bad days on the trail. I am working on finding the good things on even the tough days to make them positive.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531131,"Day 15. Sassafras Shelter to Cable Gap Shelter. Today was an interesting day. I got up fairly early. 6:45. I ate a quick breakfast and visited with everyone until 0815. It was a little foggy as it had stormed quite a bit the last night. For some reason in my mind, I thought the trail would go down to start. Sadly it started with a big climb. It took a little bit for my legs to get going. I think it had to do with chatting and laughing at some pretty funny stories till late the night before. It was worth it. The trail had some serious ups and downs today. More than an airline pilot One hill was especially difficult. It was named Jacob's ladder. In the Coast Guard, a Jacob's Ladder is a ladder a crew drops over the side of a ship so people can climb aboard. I am not going to say it was that steep, but it was one of the steepest hills to date. It was the first time in a long time I actually had to stop for a break. Today, I pretty much walked alone. I ran into Yep, Yep, for the first time in over a week. He had passed me when I took my zeroes in Franklin. He has also been writing Yep Yep on almost all signs for miles. It is like approaching Wall Drug in South Dakota. You watch for the signs as they are mildly entertaining and do give you something to do. Same here. I ran into Yep Yep at Stecoa Gap where trail magic happened. Someone brought water and apples. My apple was delicious! As it had rained all night, the trail was a little slick. I wiped out and fortunately fell straight over to the uphill side. Falling over to the downhill side would have been a doozy! I had a big mud stripe all the way up and down my side. I talked with several guys at the end of the day, and almost everyone had slipped and fallen somewhere. The good thing about the rain is that everything was so green today. I walked through several areas where the trees must have been tremendously old with beautiful fern and flower undergrowth. It was very nice walking. Tomorrow, I head to Fontana Dam to resupply. It is an easy 7 miles from the shelter. Supposedly the shelter even has showers! We shall see soon enough.","Sassafrass Shelter

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531132,"Day 16 Cable Gap Shelter to Fontana Dam Shelter - Aka the Fontana Hilton. I woke up around 7:00 this morning and had a lazy morning around camp. I got a good stretch in and was on the trail by 0840. I was ready for the uphill at the start this time. I powered right up and had my jacket off half way up the hill. Because it was a shorter distance, it seamed to take longer. Strange. I also took time to stop ands see quite a few pretty flowers. What I thought was really neat was hiking above the clouds in the valley below. I do it all the time at work, but it has been rare for me while hiking.I made it to the Fontana Dam Shelter and it is a large shelter. It sleeps 24 people on two levels. It also has a hand pump for water and a real bathroom up the way with a shower. I unpacked my stuff and took a shower first thing. It felt glorious as it was the first one after 5 days of hard hiking. After my cleanup, I put on my rain gear, put stinky clothes in a bag, and I caught the shuttle downtown. Downtown consisted of a lodge, store, laundry, and restaurant. I got my clothes clean and all was good. There was a big bunch of us hanging out and telling stories at the store. That is also the only place that I could check e-mail, etc. through wifi. ATT is not a good company for hikers! Interesting, Fontana Dam was created entirely to build the dam during WWII. It is the tallest of the Tennessee Valley Authority Dams and has prevented a lot of property damage to towns downstream as they were completely flooded out every few years. After buying a few more things, I picked up my box of food I sent myself from Franklin. Big mistake! Between what I had left and what I sent myself, I had much more than I needed. And worse, some things I was not hungry for. I traded some things out, but ended up giving a lot away. We all caught the last shuttle back to the shelter at 6:00 pm. As soon as we got to the shelter, the heavens opened and it poured for 3 straight hours. This made for a lot of cooped up people! A younger crowd tonight. A lot of kids just out of college or a year or two out. We visited about a lot of different things and had a nice time. 5 people played cards. I mostly worked on pairing down my food bag! Difficult.Finally, it got to be 9pm and Hiker Midnight. All in all a very good day! So I enter the Great Smokey Mountains National Park on Tuesday Morning.

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531902,"Days 17-21 Fontana Dam to unnamed campsite.The Smokies of North Carolina and Tennessee are beautiful. They actually remind me a lot of Idaho as they quite a number of fir trees. The Smokies also seem to attract interesting weather phenomena. And so it was for me. I departed Fontana Dam in a solid rain. I met up with Woodstock, Polar Bear, and Gandolph the Green. We climbed over 4,000 feet together and finally the clouds began to open. We talked a lot about literature. All were very well read. Gandolph could also pull out some good quotes and was working his way through the entire works of William Shakespeare on this trip. He is a chef. Woodstock is a self avowed anarchist. First I have ever met. We actually had a great visit. He believes global warming will lead to the next revolution in the US.We rolled into camp around 5 after a solid 12 miles. It was really cooling off. There, we ran into Teddy Bear, Jim, Mosie, Monkey Leg, Shortie, Lady Slipper and her husband Sage, Phillip, Peace Foot, Sailor, Up Hill, and a few other folks. Multiple bears had been sighted so we were on high alert. The next shelter up had been closed due to bears in the shelter two nights in a row. The next day it was misty and cold. The walking was fast though and I made time. I caught up with most of the folks that had started before me. Cool views were had from Old Rocky top from UT fame. There were also some amazing fields of trees. I decided to pound out 18 miles to Siler's Bald Shelter and was glad I did. I got to the shelter and some section hikers already had a fire going and gave me scotch! What a treat. I was joined by Philip, Gandolph, Shortie, Monkey Leg, Peace Foot, Sailor, and Up Hill. It was very cold by this point and the weather forecast did a complete 180. Instead of clearing skies, we were to expect a little snow. The next morning it started snowing and did not let up. I joined up with Philip, Peace foot, Up Hill, and Sailor and we decided we needed to make it to    Icewater Spring Shelter 15 miles ahead as that is what our supplies would allow. Visibility was very low and we talked about Christmas Carols and things of the Christmas season.   It felt like it and looked like it. We were in the middle of a full on blizzard. We made it to Clingamans dome, the highest point on the AT and went to the observation tower. It was pretty neat, but all we saw was snow. I used my trekking pole to wipe the snow and ice away from the sign showing what we would see on a clear day. Breathtaking I am sure. We made it to the shelter and joined some section hikers already there. It was a tough shelter and no fire was built. Even though we were bone tired we went out and found enough wood to at least dry off a few items. The next morning we found five inches of snow and it was cold. Again, the five of us set off and hiked in snow, slush, mud, and miserable conditions. A few times the sun came out and gave us hope. I also thought of how tough our special forces guys must be if they are in this day in and day out with only a poncho. We trudged 19 miles and made it to Colby Gap shelter. It was a bit lower and the weather was starting to lift. For the first time we were able to see some views. The Smokies are very beautiful. Today, we got up and it was above freezing for the first time in three days. We hiked down the mountains toward Standing Bear Hostel to pick up a resupply. We made it down around 2 and the temperature had made it into the high 60's! It felt great! I bought a round of beers for the group and so did Philip. I washed my face in a stream and it felt heavenly. The hostel felt a little creepy. It was filled with folks who decided to wait out the weather and were mostly drunk or stoned. The place was a little run down and could be amazing, but is instead run down and poorly managed in my opinion. They did have a cool little dog though. It came up to me and set a rock on my shoe. I threw the Rock and he would fetch the rock and set it back on my shoe. We decided to hike on as we did not like the looks of the folks at the hostel, so we went about three miles and made camp. Peace foot named our group 5 Alive. I think very fitting. I will describe the remaining four in more detail, but I will say that the 5 of us took on 2 of the hardest days of trekking I have experienced and made it. I will be in Hot Springs, NC on Monday and should provide more info then. My phone and external battery froze up and I was unable to take photos or even tell time for the past four days.

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532342,"So, I started my great adventure three weeks ago today. Here is a rundown as I look back:I have seen mostly good weather. Although there has been some rain and the snow and slush in the Smokies was most unexpected and difficult. My food situation has been good. I have always carried too much out of fear of running out. Sometimes an extra 5 or 6 pounds. I will work on doing better with that. My base weight is excellent and will get better still when I switch to my summer jackets shortly.Mentally I am strong! That is definitely a positive as I now know I have what it takes to finish. It is entirely whether or not I want to be on the trail. Physically I am strong, but a little tired after putting in a lot of big days in tough weather. My ankle is much, much better. It may never be 100% on the trail. My IT Band is a little tender, but doing better. I am really working on my stretching to strengthen it up. The IT Band and unexpected injury are my main real worries going forward. Just to be clear, at this point everyone is fighting a little niggle here or there. It may be a blister, sore foot, knee, ankle, etc. Backpacking is physically demanding work. So today is Mother's Day. I got reception for just a moment and tried to call Mom, but the call dropped. So I was able to get a text out. I hiked with the Five Alive group and we got about a mile up the trail when a guy coming down said people were up ahead with ice cream. We were all a bit skeptical, but sure enough, on Snowbird Mountain a group of folks set up homemade ice cream, PB and J, cookies, banana nut bread and drinks. One of the gentlemen brought out some moonshine. It was blueberry-blackberry flavored and strong! I had just a little cup and had to sit down for a few minutes! It was the most amazing and unexpected Trail Magic! My friend Kelsi also caught up to us there and hiked with us the rest of the day. It was nice.We hiked on for quite a while. To pass some time, I have instituted trivia. We try to stump each other for three straight questions. It is interesting the diverse interests of the group. So I will talk about 5 Alive.David, Peace Foot, has hiked the AT and the PCT before. He hikes in sandals. Amazing. He is in his early to mid 50's. He used to be a graphic designer and decided he had had enough. Now he hikes and bikes. He bikes with Chuck Hand, who I have flown with at SWA. Small world! Philip, Go Go Gadget, is a strong hiker and a ready guy. He has all kinds of magic apps for his phone and helps us plan our day and locate us exactly. He is from Pittsburgh, but has lived in Scottsdale and California as well. He is a few years younger than I, and is a strong hiker. He is a logistics contractor. He has wanted to do this for some time.Sam, Sailor, graduated from Providence college a few years ago and has wanted to hike the AT for some time. She grew up in Colorado, Maine, and Connecticut. She loves outdoor activities including sailing and skiing. Her Dad's family owns the longest continuously operating camp in the US and she instructs there. Helen, Uphill, is from California and graduated from Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo. She studied wildlife management and instructed at Sam's family's camp. Her boyfriend is a US expat who is in the French Foreign Legion. She has traveled a lot of the world at a tender young age.One thing about the entire group. They are all really good, really fast, and really tough hikers. Everyone is very positive and Peace Foot really sets a great tone. I am not sure how long Philip or I will hike with the group, but we all have a lot of knowledge and work together well. About 4:30, we arrived at Max Patch Bald. It was amazing! A huge grassy field with amazing views. We lounges in the sun for 45 minutes before I recommended we move on. I personally plan to return with a picnic someday. It was wonderful.We hiked for a few more hours and eventually found Kelsi at a small, suitable, area for camping near water and joined her. In order to get to Hot Springs early, we all agreed to go to bed early and wake up early. I had my usual mashed potatoes and tuna. I was put in charge of getting everyone up in the morning. I was a little nervous as this crew likes to sleep! With the trail magic and Max Patch, it was an unexpectedly nice day.","Standing Bear Hostel

I woke everyone at 0630 to make our push to Hot Springs, NC. As Chelsi was a Trombone Major at FSU, we discussed trombone music during breakfast. It was nice. The group hit the trail at 0800 led by Peace Foot. It was a pretty, lush, walk up and down several drainages until the last part of the day. It was the first day in a while that was both hot, humid, and little wind. Fortunately, it was mostly down hill! As we descended to Hot Springs, I saw my first blooming Mountain Laurel. They are so pretty! We also heard the first signs of civilization. Mostly a ton of lawn mowers. I am not sure if Monday was mowing day, but it seamed if everyone was doing it. Hot Springs is a unique little town in that the Appalachian Trail runs right through town instead of several miles outside. Main Street in fact. It is not a big town, with a diner, a tavern, Hillbilly Grocery Store, and Dollar General as the food options. And a gas station. Our group booked rooms at the historic Sunnybank house. For the last 30 years it has been run by a man named Elmer and known as Elmer's Sunnyside Inn. We checked in, took a tour of the home, dropped off our gear, took a shower, and we set off to the laundromat. I was particularly pleased as I found a shirt and shorts that fit in the hiker box so I didn't have to wear my rain gear all evening! The tavern was next to the laundromat so we had dinner and a few drinks. It was great! I had the Bob's Burger (blue cheese, bacon, fried onions) and a couple of beers. I opted for the side salad instead of the fries. It was all delicious! Plus how could I go wrong with a burger named for meElmer's has a nice patio out back and some other hikers joined us and we all laughed about the foibles of the trail. Wade joined us and tomorrow is his first day on the trail. He attended his daughter's college graduation, always a good thing to do, and decided to start where he thought he might be if he had started in April. Poor Wade was given beer, liquor, and a lot of advice! I am never one to stay up too late and headed up to bed. I cannot say how nice it is to be clean in real sheets. Getting to Hot Springs ended a long section for me. I had been on the trail continuously since Franklin. The Smokies were definitely trying, but all in all, I am very satisfied with the last 12 days of hiking.","Unnamed Campsite

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532497,"Day 24 Zero Day in Hot SpringsIt was very, very nice to sleep in a bed with real linens. I slept very well. I woke up before breakfast was ready and went and caught up with PeaceFoot on the porch. It was a nice cool morning. He decided to sweep the porch and I helped him with that. Breakfast was ready and we all sat down at the table with Elmer. He asked us a few questions about where we were from, etc. He had hosted Earl Schaefer, the first man to hike the AT when he was rehiking the AT 50 years later. Very neat. After breakfast, we adjourned to one of the rooms and proceeded to give Wade a pack shakedown. That saved him a lot of weight! I mostly just relaxed in the couch and read a very interesting book about the North American Indian Tribes. After we got Wade on his way, we all went out and took apart our own packs and food bags to see what we would need for the next 5 days. I needed some more dinners and snacks. By that time it was lunch time. I walked across to the diner and I had fried green tomatoes, fried pickles, and pizza. All were surprisingly good! The rest of the crew came along and Dave had all you can eat beans and cornbread. I had never heard of such a thing, but he liked it. Helen dared me to drink the ranch dressing, but lost on the double dare. She was feeling pretty rough the rest of the day!We walked to the local outfitter, then the Dollar General, which serves as the competing grocery to the Hillbilly store. I had the misfortune of pulling my credit card out of the machine before the clerk was ready. This caused a huge kerfuffle and really messed up the poor clerk for quite some time. I pretty much shut down Dollar General for a good 10 minutes! We dropped off our food and relaxed the porch. We were joined by Fun-Size, a normal sized guy from Oregon. He had hiked the CDT last year and is making big miles on the AT this year. We may not see him again after today. Later, Repo also joined us on the porch. He is from the Winston Salem area and is not a car repo type guy. We finally headed to dinner. It was not as good tonight. I had chicken wings and salad. That shortened dinner somewhat, we all went and visited on the porch for a short bit, and I hit the rack.My rest day was somewhat restful. However, I am now out of the ""zone"". We discussed it before bed and it is bothersome. Town is really nice, but it has a tendency to suck you in and you forget how to be a hiker. All of the cares of the world come back. On the trail you only care about hiking, eating, and a place to sleep at the end of the day. It is a very simple life that leaves much time for reflection. I am glad I took a Zero, but it is time to get back to the trail.","Hot Springs, NC

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533062,"Day 25 Hot Springs to Spring Mountain ShelterI did not sleep as well as I had the night before. It stormed early and it woke me up. I went out on the porch and watched the rain. About 8:15, the group walked over to the diner and had breakfast. It was good! Philip paid which was very nice. After breakfast, we headed back to the hostel, packed our stuff and were out by 11:00. I stopped by Dollar General to get a thing or two and walked down to the laundromat, where I had a few things in. Hiker's abounded in Hot Springs despite the weather. However, none seamed too eager to get walking. About 12:30, the group finally got out of town in a driving rain. The French Broad River was beautiful as we crossed then walked along its banks for a bit. It was flowing fast and rising with the rain. We made a steep climb up the hill overlooking the river and town. There had been a forest fire and I was confused by the burn pattern. I believe it was set as it skipped acres and burned again. Lover's Leap was also a topic of discussion. A very pretty overlook, but why would lover's want to leap from there to certain doom? After much climbing and 11 miles, we came to the Spring Mountain Shelter. We elected to camp near the shelter rather than sleep in it as the weather was supposed to be very nice. Sam built a fire and we were joined by Chad and Hazel. Chad hurt his ankle trying to stomp fire wood. The ankle looked OK, but he appeared to be hurt. We all ate and enjoyed our dinners. I had a pre made Indian dish. It was good! We played cards for a bit, a fun luxury, and wrapped it up for the evening. A productive day all in all.","Hot Springs

I did not have everything perfectly rigged as the weather report and the skies did not indicate it before bed. A few things got wet and a lot of things got muddy from splatter. As a result I just did not sleep as well. I had my favorite oatmeal, pop tarts and instant breakfast to start the day. As a result of the mud, we did not leave until almost 10. Yikes! We checked up on injured Chad and got to hiking. There was one particularly pretty spot that went along an exposed ridge. It was quite a view and fortunately no Thunderstorms were too close. We pulled into camp about 6:30 pm and got right to making camp as it looked like it might rain at any moment. The Jerry's Cabin Shelter is right on the 300 mile mark! Wow! I feel very good about that. But tired! It was an Ok day, but not as productive as any of us wanted. We decided to hit it earlier tomorrow. I will wake everyone up as usual.","Spring Mountain Shelter

However, this time everything was pretty ship shape. I woke up to check on my stuff and noticed I still got a little splatter, but not bad. Splatter is where rain drops hit the ground and bounce dirt, duff, or other raindrops up under out Lauer of the tent. Satisfied, I went back to sleep and slept better than any other night out. The rain was pretty steady and was so soothing on my tent. I woke up at 0630 and everyone else at 0720. I just have the slows in the morning and it takes me a little longer to get ready. Part of it is I am so particular about my gear and how it goes in my pack. Philip and I crossed wires and he was a little later getting up. Our goal was to bust out by 0800 and we made 0840 in the rain. Not bad, but not good. Tomorrow is another day and another opportunity. The rain is marvelous for the flora and fauna, but terrible for the trail. It was very, very, muddy for the first half of the day. Around noon, the sun came out. When we entered a beautiful pasture, we stopped for lunch and laid out our tents and gear to dry. It is amazing what a difference it makes to have clean, dry gear. It saves quite a bit of weight. After lunch we moved on and caught up with Wade from the hostel. He has decided on the trail name of Carry On. He is doing well. He gave us food as he had about too many days too many and was going to throw it out. I took it!It was a very pretty afternoon to hike. A cold front came through and it was a pleasant change. We made it to camp around 7:00 pm. We made 18.9 miles. Not bad with our breaks. We crossed Interstate 26. I will be pretty excited to cross 90. I had instant potatoes, ramen, and tuna. I also added Sriracha and Olive Oil. Very good! Philip shared jalapeño Cheetos and Sam added a Nutter Butter for everyone. I also ate a Snickers.

Fortunately, I still did not need to wear all of my clothes, so it was not too cold. I woke up at 0650 and got my stuff together. At 0713, I played reveille on my phone. That woke everyone, and much to my surprise, no complaining. In fact they liked it! Quite a crew we have.After a leisurely breakfast, very leisurely, we rolled out of camp at 0850. I was a little sad about the fact that in better weather, getting up earlier, we left later. Oh well, tomorrow is another opportunity to excel. I was a little bit of a grumpy bear as we left camp as I got some news. We crawled up the first hill and I commented that I hoped we could make Maine by my birthday. Everyone was appropriately irritated and told me we would make it. Right after, we hiked through a beautiful meadow and that cheered me up. I also saw some very pretty fields of flowers beneath the trees and this was also fantastic. Eventually we made it to Big Bald. It was much like Max Patch with a grassy top and fabulous 365 degree views. However, it was really blowing and very cold. We all layered up, had a snack, took some photos, and hiked on. The majority of the trail was down hill for the rest of the day. Other than a few isolated steep spots, it was pretty gradual, too. That is where you can make miles! After lunch, Sam took the lead and set a very fast pace. That was the last we saw of her she hiked so fast. I told her I would never be critical of her hiking abilities! We ended up getting to camp before 5:00pm and having a relaxing dinner. Sam built a fire and I had Tuna helper. It was good. I brought out the Sriracha and Olive Oil for the group. It is amazing how much better a lot of camp dishes are with a little seasoning and spice. We played a few rounds of cards and then it was time for bed. Today was a quick productive day. We pounded out 17 quick miles. We had relatively good weather and did not get rained on. Very nice! Tomorrow, we hope to be to Erwin, Tennessee by 1100.

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533706,"Day 29 No Business Shelter to Erwin, TNIt was very cold last night. I added all of my layers except my puffy down. After I got all of my layers on, I slept fine. I got everyone up at 0700 and we were actually underway at 0808! I was very pleased. I hiked with two jackets on for quite some time as it was cold and we were headed mostly down hill. It definitely takes longer to warm up heading down. We made fantastic time and Sam and Philip paced us. We did stop for a photo overlooking the Nolichucky River and surrounding hills. Very pretty in the morning light. We made it to Uncle Johnny's Hostel at 1040 covering over 6 miles in under 3 hours. We checked in, got bunks and started our laundry. We then took nice hot showers which felt sooooo good! My boxes came from my parents and it included my orange hiking shirt to replace the mice eaten shirt. I also got my trekking poles, my rust colored down sweater, and my blue rain jacket, which is 1/2 pound lighter than my ski jacket. I am very happy with my gear exchange!At 12:30 sharp, a full van load of hikers was taken to Pizza Plus for all you could eat pizza and salad bar. I do not think I have ever eaten that much pizza. Even scarier, I felt absolutely fine. Not one stomach rumble. After lunch I walked over to Dollar General and bought some supplies, including my favorite, Cheetohs Puffs! I just strap a king size bag to the outside of my pack. After a few great phone calls with the family, etc., I was summoned to the 5:30 dinner van to Mexican and Walmart. I had promised Peace Foot that I would buy the first round of Margaritas in town. I asked the waiter how many glasses a pitcher would hold and he said 4. Being 5 of us, I promptly ordered 2 pitchers. The pitchers actually served 6. So that was good. Our food came and I am sure it was the best Mexican in Erwin. However, we marveled at Helen's quesadilla that had no cheese. Just chicken. Queso means cheese. Another one of the mysteries of the universe I guess. It was almost time to go to Walmart when confusion struck. Peace Foot ordered two more pitchers of margaritas. We all drank the third pitcher, but we were losing steam. Philip asked for to go cups. The waiter laughed and Philip said he was being completely serious. I was amused as outside of New Orleans I have yet to find someplace that will give you ""liquor to go cups."" So we drank up and ran to Walmart. Sam kept me on track, so I really only bought a four or five pounds of extraneous items. Poor Philip got separated and buzzed shopping kicked in. With 10 minutes before pickup, he went hog wild and bought the most amazing assortment of junk food I have ever seen. I think he bought at least 10 pounds of candy of every variety! So I also made the mistake of buying beer which all insisted was necessary. We were picked up and driven to the convenience store where Peace Foot said he needed something. Sam, Helen and I stayed in the van and discussed interview tips and strategies for when they return to real life. Peace Foot and Philip came out of the store, and for some reason known only to God, they bought more beer. We arrived back at the hostel and I put my food on the floor in a huge heap. Sam bailed me out and said she wasn't dealing with it until tomorrow. I was relieved! So, we built a fire and drank the beer. A lot of other folks stopped by to chat, but they were smart enough to stay away from the beer. Ok. Some stories are funny when you are with folks with shared experiences. For example, Coast Guard Academy stories are still funny to my friends and I. Yes, hikers have a whole genre of stories as well. So, in a strange turn of events, the conversation somehow got turned into your funniest taking care of business in the woods story. This cleared out pretty much the rest of the sane and sober folks from the camp fire. We all laughed and laughed and then it was time for bed when at 00:30 someone asked if we were done. Yes we were officially ""those people"". It was a fun day, but really seemed like two days in one.","No Business Shelter

I felt awful!! After swearing off alcohol yet again, I got on the van to breakfast and the post office to mail my old clothes and trekking poles back home. The post office was most efficient and I made my way to the Huddle House for breakfast. Waffle House is a little more upscale than a Huddle House. I sat with Haiku who started on April 1st. He was a lit major and we talked about that and his 18 zeroes so far on the trail. He told me he had to start hiking or he would run out of money soon. I had eggs, sausage, blueberry pancakes, and Haiku's bacon. He didn't like it and I was thrilled to have it. I felt much better after breakfast.I returned to find most of the crew back in bed calling friends and chatting. I told them that we needed to turn and burn to get some hiking in. They were utterly confused by this pilot talk and I had to explain the term. Then we got going. I picked up my pack and it felt like it weighed a ton. Uncle Johnny happened to have a pack scale and it weighed in at 36 pounds. I was aghast! That is more than my first day and meant I had over 20 pounds of consumables in my pack. I don't even have a stove for goodness sake! I asked how this could happen, but I was reminded that I knew darn well how it happened. It was the margaritas! Oh well. At least I bought stuff I like to eat. We hit the trail around noon and as usual, the trail always goes up after town. We all still remembered how to hike and actually made good time. We were told by South Bound Hikers that there was Trail Magic ahead in 4 miles and the guy was only staying until 5 pm. We all dreamed about fruit and whatever drinks might be available and picked up the pace. Sadly, we arrived at the designated spot at 3:45 and the gentleman had left. Bummer. We were all sad, but trail magic is a gift to begin with. We hiked on and came to the Beautiful Spot which is a very pretty, grassy bald. Up ahead and to the side of the trail a sun tent was erected. We veered off the trail and made straight for it. When we arrived, we found great trail magic offered by two Triple Crowners. With PeaceFoot, 3 of the 250 people ever to hike all three long trails, the Appalachian Trail, Continental Divide Trail, and Pacific Crest Trail were in one spot. They had some great stories. I was challenged to see if I could fit over 20 cheese balls in my mouth at one time. I doubled down, but lost the shake out. I succeeded in getting 21 in, but I looked like a deranged chipmunk. I ate a banana and had an ice cold Coke. It all tasted great! We hiked on and came to a great campsite a couple miles up the way. Sam built a fire and we had hot dogs, chips, and a bunch of Philip's candy for dessert. They were some of the tastier hot dogs I have had! It began to get dark and we all turned in for the night. So, at the end of the day, I have hiked 354 AT miles and 8 more on the approach trail my first month on the trail. That averages out to roughly 12 miles a day with 3 zeroes. The ankle sprain certainly slowed me down, but had I not had it, I would not have met the fine folks I am currently hiking with. I am very thankful for my first month on the trail.","Erwin, TN

We were still able to get some good views and we climbed quite a bit. We climbed Roan Mountain, which is over 6000 feet. It had a very pretty pine forest at the top. It is also the site of an old resort. It was right on the state line, so if you were on the TN side you could drink, but the NC side you could not.We walked a little further and came to the Roan Mountain Shelter. It is the highest on the AT. I found it a bit creepy! We made a very Rocky descent and made our way down to Carver's Gap and then walked back up to Jane's Bald. Both were beautiful! It was Dad's birthday and I tried unsuccessfully to give him a ring.We made about six more miles to the Overland Shelter, otherwise know as The Barn. The bottom with the view was full, so we slept up top. We were glad we did as it began to rain not long after we arrived. The mice were active in the night, which kind of kept me from sleeping as well as I would have liked. The guys below smoked a ton of weed and that was bothering me as well. As it turned out, my water bladder was not screwed 100% tight and the guys below complained that it was dripping on them. They asked if I could stop the drip. I said sure.

PeaceFoot's niece brought us pizza and beer for lunch at a road intersection! Wow! How nice. We went over 400 miles! Amazing!After lunch we entered a Sasquatch Protection Area. It was still muddy and goopy. We saw no sign of Sasquatch. We decided to go to a hostel that was a half mile off the trail to get out of the rain. We were a little nervous as this place was in the middle of Nowhere! When we arrived at the Van Go Memorial hostel, we were greeted by Scotty, the owner. He was giving us the low down when PeaceFoot said, ""You don't remember me do you?"" Scotty looked at him for a second and said , ""Dave!""

He doesn't know what to do. Might have to stay where we are for the night. I am thinking to myself what in the world is balling up the trail that we might have to be done at 2:00 pm! So I ask him what is the matter? He says that there are cows blocking the trail and some of them have babies and he is afraid they could be dangerous. I went from concerned to highly amused. I asked him where he was from and he said New Jersey. Yep. So we got him calmed down and I said we would get him through. We got our stuff together and walked to the pasture where the cows were located. I can hear the panic in his voice. ""They have all congregated at where the trail goes. They were more spread out before!"" I said no problem. The cows had all moved to the trail up and over as it was sunny and that was the only shade. As we were making our way up to the cows, a really neat thing happened. A cow dropped a calf right in front of us. I had never seen that before. Very neat.

Then I made the mistake of going to the grocery store hungry and it really affected my buying. We also decided to grill out for dinner. Of course, I never do anything half way and put out a total spread of veggies and steak, cheese and bread. It was really great! We had enough to share and still had enough for lunch the next day!At dinner, we were entertained by another Matador incident. This cat got in Matador's tent, the same guy who was petrified of the cows yesterday. Anyway, he would put his hand under the rain fly to get the cat out and it would bat and try and bite his hand. Of course he would recoil. Well, eventually he picked up that end of the tent and got the cat out. Of course the cat was having a great time so it ran right back in! So he closed the door and eventually got the cat back out doing the same pawing, biting and recoiling routine! So with the door closed, the cat ran underneath the rain fly. Poor Matador pretty much took down his whole tent trying to get the cat out and keep it out. We all agreed that it was one of the funniest and most entertaining things we had seen in a long time!

It was so nice to start the day with a shower. I got ready and met Helen out front at 0625. We walked up to the nice gas station, but it was closed, so we had to backtrack to the old gas station as it was open. I bought a sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit, a coffee, and peanut butter cups for breakfast. It was good! The rest of group had told us they were 4 miles up the trail. We caught up to them right on time at 0800. It was sprinkling, but not too heavy so I did not don my rain jacket. We passed through some beautiful fields that were being used to graze cows. Tall alfalfa and Amazing views. I am sure these farms had been in their respective families for generations! We also had a few tough climbs today, but we made it to the shelter by 6pm. I heard there were horses at the shelter and I was not pleased about it. They really chew up the trail. When I arrived, there were a bunch of a amateur drunk riders that were hard on the horses and had thrown beer cans on the ground. I was ticked. They got their picture taken and then I asked them if they were going to pack out their trash. They belatedly said yes. The situation diffused, but I had to step away until they left. On the positive side, our campsite was very pretty and I had a good mountain house meal for dinner. We went back over to the shelter and visited with about 10-15 of our friends before heading to our tents for bed. A super productive day! 24 miles on muddy and challenging terrain.","Budget Hotel, Atkins, VA

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536825,"Day 44 Chestnut Knob Shelter to Bland, VAWe got an early start as we were trying to make it all the way to Bland, VA, for some food. PeaceFoot had supplies sent to a hotel, so that was our main impetus to get there.The trail was relatively mild as far as hills and terrain was concerned and the trail was in excellent shape. We were able too knock out our 22 miles by 4:30. From there, everything got a little crazy. There were a ton of hikers trying to hitchhike into town. It took us a half hour, but a nice lady in a suburban picked us up and took us close to our hotel. I ate dinner at Dairy Queen and had a big burger. It was so good. After, I hiked up the hill to the hotel and got a room to share with Philip. For the first time, my left knee really started acting up. I iced it and visited with a group of hikers in front of the gazebo. I think it was a few too many miles in short of a time. Plus I tweaked it when I slipped on some rocks. I did not fall, but it really hurt. I was feeling really tired and a bit grumpy and hit the bed early.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537725,"Day 45 Bland, VA to Dude Fest at Trent's Grocery I got up at 0615 after sleeping just OK. My knee was bothering me and any movement woke me up. I took a quick shower and walked to Subway with Sam, Philip, and Helen. They had a deal going where you could buy a sandwich and get a breakfast sandwich free. I thought it was a great deal. I took the sandwich for lunch. I then walked over to the Dairy Queen, ate another large Blizzard, and bought a few bars for a snack. We got a shuttle to the trail at 9:00 and we were hiking shortly after. We climbed a big hill and realized there was no more water for the next 10 miles. PeaceFoot and I went and got water for the group from a nearby spring that was a half mile off the trail. Bummer! We were all really excited to get to Dude Fest and fortunately the trail was not too bad. We stopped to get lunch at the next shelter. My sandwich was great!   We were ahead of schedule, so we took a nap for 30 minutes. We hiked the remaining 6.5 miles to Trent's Grocery in a little over two hours. We also went over 600 miles!!! We grabbed some supplies and some beer and were directed to a field out back. There, the Dude and a bunch of fellow hikers were eating burgers and hot dogs. A big fire was lit and we had a great time. I would guess 25-30 hikers camped there for the night. The owner of the place had a beautiful red quarter horse. He pranced around and knew he was a special guy. We had bought some baby carrots at the store and I brought him a couple. I scratched his neck for quite some time. He really liked me and I was the only one he would come visit. We all ate too much and stayed up too late. We had a great time visiting though. We ended up doing 18 miles, which is very respectable.","Hotel, Bland, VA

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537728,"Day 46 Trent's Grocery to Great Dismal Falls Campsite I did not sleep well and woke up early. My horse, Red, was waiting for me and I gave him half a hamburger bun and scratched his neck. I walked over to the fire and visited with some of the campers who were already awake. After a bit, my crew woke up. We put in a load of laundry and walked down to the grocery store to grab a bite. It was packed! I grabbed a carton of cottage cheese, some V8, and ordered a couple of ham and egg biscuits. It took a while for the biscuits to get get ready so we sat and visited. It was fun.Someone said one of the ladies that camped out with us was a nurse and I showed her how swollen my left knee had become. She said it looked like bursitis and I needed to ice it, elevate it, and use compression at the end of the day. Obviously hiking was not good for it. Also stay hydrated and drinking beer was not the best for it. I set out to do all I could to help it and kept it elevated for a while. It helped! At noon it was time to hike to the Great Dismal Falls. This was the continuation of Dude Fest. It was hot and I was a bit gimpy today. When I arrived, quite a few hikers were already there and the falls did look quite nice. We made our way down to the bottom and swam. I soaked my knee in the water and it felt great. Later I took a nap and that really felt nice. A big thunderhead became visible and I told everyone it was going to rain. We headed to a campsite, pitched our tents and climbed in just in time! We waited for the rain to pass and then cooked dinner and went to bed early as we were all tired!We only hiked 3 miles, but my knee, Sam's Ankles, and Helen's shin splints were all thankful.","Dude Fest Trent's Grocery

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537732,"Day 47 Dismal Falls Camp to Woods Hole HostelI got up at 0645 and woke everyone else at 0701. It was a bit foggy, but comfortable. I did not sleep as well as I was trying to keep my swollen leg elevated. So I slept intentionally with my head down hill. It did help the leg as the swelling went down a little. Everything was wet from the rain the previous night. I ate a leisurely breakfast and we all left the camp site at 0900. I hiked at a slow bell as my knee was very stiff. Fortunately, the trail was very smooth for the most part. Helen's back was hurting and Sam's Ankles were bothering her. PeaceFoot and Philip were still going strong.We all met at a shelter for lunch and heard threatening thunder off in the distance. However, it looked like it would miss us. It did for the most part and when we climbed a good hill, it had cleared off for a good view. I listened to the last of my Douglas MacArthur book as I walked. Then another storm cloud passed overhead and the heaven's opened. I saw a flash of light and heard a sharp crack. Lightening had struck a tree just ahead of PeaceFoot, who was just visible ahead. I actually ducked when the lightning hit the tree nearby. Wow! It rained on me really hard for the next 1/2 hour as I made my way to the Wood's Hole Hostel. We had heard it was a nice place to stay and it was really super! It is a sustainable farm and they grow all their own fresh vegetables. I got in out of the rain and changed into dry clothes. My stuff was sopping wet! I ordered fresh bread, butter and cheese for us and we gobbled it down. It was excellent! Between arrival and dinner, we played cribbage and visited with all the hikers stoping by to get out of the rain. Dinner was served at 7:00 pm and it was delicious. Fresh salad and gumbo for dinner followed by homemade ice cream cones. After dinner, I just visited with everyone for a little bit. We did 13 miles. It was all we could do and I was so glad to make it to the hostel!","Great Dismal Falls- Dude Fest Day 2

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539973,"Day 65 Zero in Waynesboro, VA.This story goes back to the Smokies of North Carolina. When we were slogging through the snow, we were trying to come up with things to look forward to that would help us make it through. My idea: wine tasting in Virginia. The crew instantly thought it was an amazing and much hype was built up around all we would do. I knew the logistics might be tough, but doable. Sam had grandiose plans. We should all dress up (she loves to), guys could have fancy hats, etc. Every day she thought of ways to dress PeaceFoot and I. You would think we were her stuffed animals or something. How she would pull this off was a mystery to me, but 600 miles stood between me and wine tasting. I was not too concerned. Well, we actually made it to Waynesboro and it was time to go wine tasting. I got up early and had the free breakfast at the hotel. I initially sat withThe Dude. He had all kinds of funny stories for me. I saw Braveheart for the first time in 700 miles. He was taking a little time off to recoup and reported on many folks I had not seen in a while. After breakfast, I got a car from Enterprise. I got a little car as they did not have any of the bigger cars I wanted. I was nervous about driving as I hadn't in two months. I had seldom even been in a car! Well, I did just fine. A relief! I drove a little slow on the freeway. I just was not used to high speed. If only I had my car!I got back to the room about 08:30 and went to the coin op and did our laundry. I washed our socks separately. It was the first time our socks came out OK!! Man, they were bad. With the rain and humidity, a worn pair of socks would not dry. I had discovered that hiker shoe and sock funk is the prevalent bad smell. And our packs.At 10:30 I rounded everyone up and we left for the Salvation Army Thrift Store. It was the usual gang of Helen, Sam, PeaceFoot and I. However, C-sharp was hanging around and we had another seat, so we asked him to come along. He was very excited to join us. We worked our magic in the thrift shop. I picked out shoes, shorts, and a tie for PeaceFoot to go with his new blue shirt. For under $10 each, we cleaned up really well!I checked out and while I was waiting for them to pay, I ran across the street to Kroger to buy a picnic lunch. I am always afraid someone might go hungry and I bought enough food to feed the Union Army. I was pleased with my food choices, though. Meats, cheeses, fruit, hummus, chips, etc. We took a few pictures and then it was time to head out. I told everyone about a few of the do's and don'ts of wine tasting while I drove. I soon learned that Sam asked me that just so she could tease me by doing every one of the don'ts just to get a rise out of me! Our first stop was Veritas winery. My favorite. It was fantastic. We bought a bottle of wine and had our picnic overlooking the valley. It was great. My friends were very pleased with my picnic. From there, we went to Cardinal Point, Pollack and King Family vineyards. At King Family, we met one of the owners, Carigan King. Super guy. Later we found out one of Sam's college friends babysat for his kids as she was from the area. Small world. Unbeknownst to us, they were having a wedding at King Family that day (on a Monday??? Really??). The wine pourers asked us if we were there for the wedding as we looked so nice. We said we weren't and totally missed our chance to crash the party. Oh well. The wine pourers took a real liking to our story of adventure and gave us a free cheese ball and bottle of Meritage wine. I had a sip. It was really, really good. The group was totally amazed by a chandelier made with antlers. I thought it was cool, but not a big deal as I have been to any number of bars and cabins with that decor in Idaho. They also let us continue our picnic on the patio after official closing time. Very nice!! Eventually, it was time to go and I drove us back to Waynesboro. I had a great time. All expectations were exceeded, so I was very pleased. We sang in the car when the Beatles Uncle Albert song came on. It was fun. We ended the evening by playing some cribbage, watching a little TV, and going to bed. One of our most fun days on the trail!","Waynesboro, VA

Bob Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539965,"So, It has been a bit since I posted. My apologies. It has been a wonderful and difficult 3 weeks all at the same time. The wonderful part was seeing the trail in its beauty, walking with my friends, meeting new friends along the way, and the fun times we had in towns and campsites. The difficult part is that my knee did not get better. It got worse. Every mile hurt. A lot. Almost to the point where for the first time in my life it was not enjoyable to hike. Regardless, I hiked on. I did so out of determination, my love for the trail, and encouragement of the wonderful people on the trail. All of that changed on Friday when my knee just locked up a couple of times and would not loosen up. It made it impossible to walk. I hitched to Luray, VA and went to the doctor. Initial tests showed I have a damaged meniscus in my left knee. Fortunately, this is an easier repair and I am going to get it repaired. Fortunately, the timing was such that my friends and I were scheduled to take a zero and my friend Sharif came and picked me up and took me to a hotel by the airport. As my pass privileges are inactive, my brother was nice enough to get me on a flight to Spokane. There, I plan to get more tests done, get surgery if needed, and get back on the trail as soon as I can. I have been asked how I feel, am I angry, etc? I am sad the injury happened. However, it was not due to carelessness and sometimes things just happen. I am sad I had to leave my friends on the trail. However, the trail community is a small place and I have no doubt that I will see many of them again. Who knows how or when. No goodbyes, just laters. It has been a privilege to walk on the trail for 941 miles. I am thankful for every mile I was able to walk and am always looking for life's nuggets with each mile. I am relieved to get this knee fixed as I have not walked normally or without a limp for 3 weeks. It hurts all the time. I am excited to get back to the spry PB Tater of last month. Finally, as a believer in God, I know he has a plan for me. I do not divine to know his purposes, but I will keep my eyes open as often we learn more in a tough time than we do when times are easy. I will always remember hiking up Jacob's Ladder, Sassafras Mountain, Max Patch or the Grayson Highlands because they were challenges I overcame or were extraordinary places. I cannot remember off the top of my head what happened on the 3rd easier day in a row. I will post some of the writings I have worked on, but did not get a chance to post from the last few weeks. Thanks for your thoughts and prayers!","Crystal City Marriott
