Kristen Braddock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/488275,"""I must be crazy right?!"" These are the words that I try not to let plague my mind as I walk on the shoulder of a busy highway near my neighborhood in Florida. Beads of sweat dripping down my face and cars already blazing their horns as if to put in their two sense about me losing the last of my marbles. ""You'll never make it"" one car toots on ""You need society to survive"" another one chimes in. ""Maine is an awful long way from here"", that commentary was all my own. I graduated from UNF in December of 2014. I was a psychology major and eager to soak up anything I could learn about the human condition. Why are human beings so freaking crazy? I believe this was my general question. I realized early on that becoming a therapist was not the alley in which my life needed to be heading. I want to help people, I really do, but this just does not seem like a fulfilling outlet in which to do so. Truth is: I don't care about money, I wouldn't know what to do with all that money even if I had it. I want more experiences and less possessions; this is my new mantra and I am sticking to it. After I graduated I had to wait to have surgery (which finally happened about 7 weeks ago now). I apparently ""had a parathyroid the size of a blueberry"". In case you are not familiar that is not a good thing folks (neither is it a pleasant experience to endure). I received my TOEFL certification (which enables me to teach English overseas) while waiting around for the surgery. I am not too entirely thrilled about being a teacher to students that can't understand a word of what i'm saying, but I have a craving for adventure and travel. That being said, I am at a crossroads in my life. I am currently looking for ""a big girl job"" but what can you honestly do with a Bachelor's degree in psychology besides sit behind a desk for 40 hours a week, fight traffic everyday and slowly sink into the trap that is called society. Leaving little time or money to plan for, or execute anything besides the daily grind. I saw myself on that sad, slow conveyor belt as I paged through the endless monotonous job entries online. These online job searches often ended up with me researching some other topic I was interested in at the time, or checking my social media sites. On one such tangent I had a wild hair to start looking up information about the Appalachian Trail. A few hours later I had ordered two books about the trail and had learned enough online to make this my new obsession. From the moment I started reading about it the trail spoke to me. I know little about it, yet I feel so very compelled. I have since gobbled up the initial two books and am craving for more! I have made up my mind, I AM thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail in Spring of 2016! Won't you take this journey with me? Peace.Love.AT-Kristen <3","

Kristen Braddock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/488715,"Hello fellow hikers!Has anyone thought about or is anyone looking into getting a sponsorship to hike the trail? As a newly graduated college student money isn't exactly free flowing. If anyone knows someone who is being sponsored I would love to hear feedback as to how it is going so far. I have contacted Vasque footwear they have a syndicate program this year where you can watch live feeds from backpackers on the AT and the PCT! Also you can see where they are at on the map in real time! It's really neat, but then again a little creepy, don't you think? I have been reading up on safety on the trail, and it doesn't seem too smart to let everyone on the world wide web know where you will be laying your head in the deep dark wilderness. Maybe it is just me being paranoid...thoughts on this anyone?Anyway, just in case I don't get sponsored I still continue to look for a job so I can start saving for this journey. Looking and applying for jobs is seriously my least favorite thing to do, seriously it sucks! The only thing that is getting me through is picturing myself reaching the peak of Mt. Katahdin! I am so determined! Katahdin isn't even the end goal though, the end goal is starting. Starting is the hard part...it's the finishing that will be easy. I am not excited for the end result(well I am, but I am sure it will be bittersweet), I am ecstatic for the journey, the thrill, every miserable, amazing, difficult, beautiful, wet, cold, hot, tiring, sweaty, stinky mile of it! Peace.Love.AT.","

Kristen Braddock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/495517,"Hello again my followers! (it sounds weird to say that!) I didn't think anyone would read this thing, but I have had a lot of views! I am more so using this as a motivational tool for myself but I appreciate you all! *Quick note: I didn't realize on my last posts that I said I had embarked already, forgot to check the preparation box at the top. I am most definitely still prepping and am going on this journey next year.* Okay, now that we've got that squared away, where to begin? It has been a while! I have been relentlessly looking for a job. Good news though, I have found two! Okay, so I am not utilizing my degree in any way shape or form, but I am about to get my first check and am FINALLY going to be able to put something away in my A.T fund! I am waiting tables in the evenings (which I swore I would never do again) and soon I shall be working as a camp counselor during the day for a summer camp. I am stoked about being able to spend my whole summer in the out of doors and getting paid for it! Let me tell you about some other cool things that have happened lately. I make gemstone jewelry as a hobby (kept me busy while sick and recovering from surgery) I am quite passionate about rocks! Anyway I decided to sell them for the first time last weekend. I went to a craft show and set up a small booth. I sold a few pieces of jewelry but the crowd was really too old to be interested in the pieces that I make. Since there were going to be no food vendors at the event, I decided to buy some candy bars, bottles of water and small bags of chips to sell at my booth. I simply put the products on my table and a sign that said ""FUNDRAISING TO THRU-HIKE THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL"" I thought I would sell out of snacks, but the crowd was very old and I sold only one bottle of water. All of that being said, what made my day was this: Towards the very end one lady came up to me and said ""are you the person that is going to hike the Appalachian Trail?"" I said ""yes ma'am!"" She then proceeds to give me five dollars and tell me that she wishes she had more. She wanted no beverage or snack, just to donate to my cause. She said her son had tried to thru-hike a few years back and ended up injuring his ankle too badly to finish. I wanted to chat some more, I had been waiting all day just for someone to ask me about the trail! But sadly, she was quick to leave. This is probably a good thing however, because I do not like to cry in front of people and boy the tears were coming on! I consider my self quite the empathetic person. Literally when I witness people being positive towards one another it touches me to the core. I am so used to seeing the absolute worst come out of people that I cannot contain myself when I witness something selfless. To that kind old lady: Thank you for believing in me, it makes me believe in myself even more! I have so much love for everyone, I need to keep reminding myself this as I enter back into the service industry. Nothing can bring me down, everyday is another closer to living my dream of walking this trail! Goodnight my friends! Peace.Love.AT","
