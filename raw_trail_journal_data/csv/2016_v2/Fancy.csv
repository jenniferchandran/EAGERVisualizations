Fancy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/437538,"Hello!I suppose my first post should be the post to introduce myself. My name is Ben, though I suppose the nickname of Fancy suffices.I grew up in Florida and spent the majority of my formative years there, including four and a half years at Florida State's College of Music. I worked at Starbucks for a time (best two years of my life), and am now enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. I get out in March of 2016, at which point I will be thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail in what I'm hoping will be a rediscovery of self-expression and inward discovery. The calendar lines up perfectly between my end of active service and my return to college the following late August. That gives me a little less than five months to get from Springer Mountain to Mt. Katahdin.",,First Post,"Oct 26, Sat",0
Fancy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/437539,"As a Marine, I admit I have the advantage of training constantly in a manner that certainly helps with distance backpacking. Fighting through pain, physical fitness, field craft, carrying large amounts of weight for long distances quickly--these are all practiced on a regular basis. However, as a Marine there is also the problem of unintentional pride and stubbornness. If I have a lot of knee pain or blisters, I fight through it until I either don't care anymore or it goes away. I bite off far more than I should, then end up choking on it in an attempt to show that I can chew it.My gear selection will be researched in the field and online over the next two years in preparation for this. My aim is to have a base pack weight of 20 pounds, though knowing myself all too well, this may increase.",,Second Post,"Oct 26, Sat",0
Fancy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/437540,"As I said in my first entry, I'm appoaching the Trail with a hope for renewal of self-expression and inward discovery. As a Navajo would enter the desert on a Spirit Quest or a 19th Century German masonry apprentice would journey from town to town in his search for craftmanship, I will be on my own path to find my true voice in this ever-growing glot of global civilzation and instantaneous information transfer.We, as a human species still have a very long, prosperous future ahead of us, and with the endeavors of such people as John Muir and Teddy Roosevelt, we will enjoy the first Church for a very long time. This quest is simply my way of drawing from that infinite well of inspiration.I hope to make contact with a few fellow hikers before 2016 comes around. Spring 2014 I should start posting gear reviews.A soft green zephyrCalling softly through the whiteFor the walk draws nigh.",,View Entry,"Oct 26, Sat",0
Fancy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/438733,"A few things have been going through my head as I ponder the forthcoming experience. The biggest thing is the great question of ""Why?"" I really don't know. It's certainly something good for body, mind and soul. It's a unique experience that comes not even once per lifetime. It's an incredible experience of adventure and survival. It's... I don't know why. I really don't.

In Stephen King's novel The Stand, he introduced me to the idea that walking can be used as a form of spiritual ablution. The heavy-handedness of the symbolism was one of the weaker points in the novel, but it nonetheless struck me. I like to view the spiritual world as manifesting itself from symbols. If you do something symbolically, it is mirrored in one's character. If I walk for a symbolic cleansing, my inner-being will shed a little more light than it used to. Of course I haven't put this speculative jibber-jabber through any test yet, but walking twenty miles nearly every day for four months certainly will. This should be an interesting point to follow.

Not to make a post of naught but literary references, but Calvin's dad from Calvin and Hobbes had always tried to convince Calvin (and the more sensible reader, I'm sure) that miserable conditions and overcoming difficulties builds character. After spending time as a grunt in the Marine Corps, I'm all but certain of this concept's validity as long as the mind is set correctly. Even if everything I've heard about the Trail is false, I know that misery and hardship will occur. I can therefore safely conclude I step off Mt. Katahdin as a better person.

I love the idea of the Vision Quest. Young First Nations Brave goes into the wilderness and doesn't return until his mind ascends reality and he receives not only spiritual guidance directly from nature about his path within this world, but the path within his internal realm. There are some similarities between what I'm to accomplish and what Young Brave accomplishes. I will be in a ""between"" stage of my life; I will be a young (sort of) man searching for himself and his part to play on this giant stage; I will be spending a great deal of time communing with nature--Side note: If you see some dude with red hair making animal sounds and not-so-socially acceptable body movements towards something unseen in the woods, it may be me--and I will be actively seeking different levels of consciousness as I progress.

Akin in some respects to the Vision Quest was the goings-on of the wandering journeyman from Europe. Between apprenticeship and master-craftsmanship was the journeymanship. In order for many journeymen to even apply for a master's title, their trade guild would require them to travel from town to town and city to city in order to learn different styles, and therefore become more well-rounded. Obviously, this is not Pre-Industrialist society, so the wandering journeyman is all but extinct; and for all the writing and artisanship I'll perform on the Trail, I'll still be an amateur; but that doesn't take away from the romance of such a sojourn. Many personal heroes of mine have undergone such as this, so I suppose this is simply more subconscious symbolism. If I do as Gustav Mahler did, perhaps I will become such as he.

Anyways, I wish I could give a more concrete answer to the question of ""Why?"" I just understand that this path will be both transformative and transcendent. I understand I will leave it as a better person. What more could I ask for?

Fancy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/467245,"It's been a successful spring and early summer as far as gear tests have gone. Three days in Shenandoah and a few days out and about in North Carolina has given me some insight on my current arrangement.First, the Osprey Kestrel 48 is an awesome pack as far as gear carriage and comfort goes. It didn't feel like I was carrying a pack; it felt like I was a few pounds heavier. However, (I blame it on the Corps spoiling me) I like to strap things to the outside. My tent, my mat, my sleeping bag, a couple of pouches... The Kestrel has a serious lack of straps. There's two in the front good for a tent, and there's a couple on each side that don't work for anything, really, besides maybe a camp stool. The side pockets and dust cover work well enough, but I'd like more. I'll most likely shop for packs again.I thought a two-person tent would be great for a bit of spacious luxury, and if the need arose, would provide shelter for someone else. It's up in two minutes, down in three and has--just as I wanted--a cavernous interior and roomy vestibules. It has a single H-style pole for its frame and a small cross-bar. Both of which snap into shape almost immediately. The fabric hooks onto the frame and the cover goes on top. Despite its unfortunate weight (5.4 lbs, if I remember correctly), I'm still considering it for the hike, simply because it's the best tent I've ever owned.I'm considering taking boots off the gear list. Well, I'm considering taking footwear off. A trip to (and on...and in) frozen Lake Michigan in March involving four miles in knee-deep snow and forty miles in North Carolinian Piedmont barefoot, and fifty miles on the Shenandoah in Reef flip-flops have started to convince me that my feet are tough. Very tough. And seeing as how this is as much an emotional and spiritual journey as much as a physical one, bare feet would only highlight the positive aspects of it. I would still have a pair of air-cushioned sandals as a back up, but a full barefoot trek is starting to gnaw in the back of my mind. I need to decide quickly, as training for something like this will take around a year of pain and soreness.",,Updates,"Jul 22, Tue",0
Fancy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/493132,"Mid-February, a couple of months ago, I traveled to Asheville and the Smokies for a final weekend of beer, people and hiking before a three month jaunt to California for the Marine Corps' female integration assessment (I'm not exactly entitled to a public opinion on this matter until the DoD makes a decision come January.). It was a memorable time to say the least, as I finally made my way to Wicked Weed Brewery, and I aced a basket at Richmond Hills disc golf course. Mostly, though, I made the decision on footwear for the AT...I got a late start the morning of the 14th, it was a rather frigid morning and the Wicked Weed's yeasty product from their Funkatorium was still fogging my head. I pulled into the parking lot for the Alum Cave Bluffs Trail around one in the afternoon and set off with warming layers, a twenty pound weight, water, food and a camera on me, and with my flip-flops in the car. The first four miles are excellent: I'm getting an excellent quad-burn, my calves are nice and loose and my lungs are pistoning; and the mountains are in awesome condition without a soul around (except one other hiker a couple of hours ahead of me), good snow coverage above thirty-five hundred feet and some fresh bobcat and deer tracks. The ambient temperature is hovering around 40 degrees. A little before three o'clock hits, a patch of hidden ice takes my left foot while my right foot is firmly placed behind a rock. Instinctually, I lean forward and try to roll, but it's too late. My right foot turns inward awkwardly and I feel a sharp bite of pain on the outside. Being so close to the cliff tops, I push on with a slow limp. A spend some time up there warming my feet with my fleece gloves and beenie and wondering why I forsook my first-aid kit. Once I start the descent, I realize that I've wasted a lot of time, allowing the sun to set and the temperature to drop. Once the temperature drops below freezing, my feet are no longer on ""invincible"" status. After around four hours of pain and adrenaline, I return to my car. I turn the heat on full blast and aim it at my feet while driving back to my hotel in Asheville. Feeling doesn't fully return, and where it does, it's a horrible aching sting. Frostbite. It takes about two weeks for the pain and blisters to subside, and another three weeks for the eschar to slough off. They have made a full recovery, and I've now learned my feet's current breaking point as far as temperature goes. It took a near-disaster to give myself the push towards the decision: I will feel every mile, every yard, every stone of the Appalachian Trail with the soles of my feet.Over the next ten months, I'll be following a training plan to develop firm, supple callouses on my feet, and to tone and strengthen the musculature and connective tissue. It'll be rough, but it'll be worth it. Pain builds character.",,Barefeet,"May 07, Thu",0
Fancy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516578,"I've spent seven of my last ten months in the deserts of California. Beautiful, dangerous, hostile, dream-like. The sunsets are blends of color unable to ever be recreated, even by the ancient sky creature dreaming the clouds into existence; the skies at night are swirls of indigo and black and the non-color of a million champagne diamonds flung into infinity; the heat of the June sun and the formidable breezes of late October are but a moment lost in the great temporal dust-devil controlling the slow weathering of the mountains and the carving of the canyons. I truly love it out here.My plans for the Trail are all but cemented in place. My savings account, my gear, my feet are all in order. My family and friends are prepared. The mountains' call is louder than ever. Soon, all too soon, I shall be stepping off on the greatest adventure the East Coast has to offer.For those that have signed my guestbook, I thank you. They have all been read and appreciated. For those that I will meet along the way, I wish you well, and may Trail bring us together in the best possible ways.Fair weather and following trails.",,Pre-hike Updates,"Oct 29, Thu",0
Fancy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525878,"The day started in a hotel near the base of I-985. My mother and her dog, my brother, my sister-in-law, and my niece all joined me to Amicalola Falls State Park to see me off. The falls had a beautiful overview from the top of the cascades, and it was there I said farewell, for what I thought was only a day. They had planned to meet me at the top of Springer Mountain the next morning.While the hike started damp and foggy, the rain slowly crept up, the ceiling eventually enveloping the trail.  A portion was hiked with another potential thru-hiker, Tyler, from West Virginia. He was building his trail legs, and I was building my trail feet, so our pace was similar. The climbs and descents were moderate, but the amount of fist-sized talus and sticks did an efficient job destroying what calluses I had built up.Atop Springer, I ran into some day campers with a large fire going. At enthusiast, Mountain Squid, had plenty of advice on the next few miles of trail, and the upcoming shelters. He showed me the Trail log and the first official blaze, and we parted ways.I chose a campsite away from The shelter--It was crowded and noisy--against a log with a sturdy pine branch for my food bag. I wrote a short letter to Julie and bedded down early, rolling my sleeping bag in my tarp, trying to beat the upcoming downpour. I fell asleep to the sound of wind moving through the bare branches, and rain pattering against my tarp. I thought of Julie, Tallahassee, Pensacola, my friends and family that I wouldn't see for at least four months.","Amicalola Falls State Park

Fancy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525880,"The day began late. Despite the tarp, the rain soaked through the foot off my sleeping bag, pruning my feet, and adding at least five pounds to my already heavy pack.The vista looking west from Springer was obscured by fog and cloud, but the lifeless trees and leafy ground cover adopted a dreary, ghastly pall. The Trail slowly vanished into a vapor-white sheer: the mystery of what lies ahead, something beautiful and hallowed. I was anxious to begin.I was planning on meeting my family on the pinnacle, at the startpoint, but conditions along the forest road prevented their arrival. I didn't begin the hike until around 11, but it allowed me to meet a few hikers: Kernal, a man in his late fifties who kept to himself, but seemed at peace; a section hiker in his late twenties, soon to depart to Lithuania for a job; and several others, all looking to find themselves in Maine in the coming months.The Trail took me through rhododendron tunnels, pine and fir forests with thick trunks and high canopies, across a mile of rough gravel, and down easy rolling paths. One of the more beautiful hikes I remember.At the Hawk Mountain shelter, I ran into Tyler again, though he was pushing for Justus Creek a few miles up. I decided to call an early day to catch up on some writing. After an early dinner, I talked to a family of section hikers trying to complete the Trail in the father's lifetime, as well as two thru-hikers, Cara-Pace and Scully. While the shelter was already full, there was plenty of space to camp.The sleeping bag was still wet, but with the tarp retained all the heat I needed. As I was trying to go to sleep, a boisterous married couple start willing and getting on their cell phone to what I assume was their daughter--I know her gender because they had her on speaker phone. It was their first time hiking, and couldn't contain their excitement about how hard it was, and how beautiful it was. I'm truly glad for their experience, but please, for the love of the mountains, learn some manners.A side note: I ate all my Easter candy. I live with no shame.","Springer Mountain

Fancy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525881,"The night before once again soaked the foot off my sleeping bag. I slept fine, but the work I had done on my feet was ruined. My feet were now completely pruned, soft, peeling, and large water pockets developed on my big toes and the pads of the balls. Hiking, and even walking without my pack off was painful beyond what I had imagined would happen in the worst case scenario, and to make matters worse, the pockets of water burst, oozing not only clear fluid, but a slight amount of blood. Once lunch rolled around, I realized not only that my feet could go septic, but I'm moving far too slowly for a four-month finish.Once the antiseptic and the flip flops were applied, I moved significantly faster. I started hiking with a woman in what I assume is her late twenties, Lisa, and we stopped at the Gooch Mountain Shelter for dinner. I talked with Jack, another Marine veteran, one who served in ANGLICO, who was out for a few days.Lisa and I decided to hike on for another few miles, receiving our first Trail Magic along the way (Yerba Mate tea) until we arrived at a campsite occupied only by Lithuania. I stayed behind for the evening, and Lisa pushed on another hundred yards, where a group of people were having a social fire next to a forest road. Lithuania was an active duty soldier on leave, taking a few days to get away from everything. He was a really intelligent, well-spoken guy, providing me with some of the best conversation I've had for a while.I don't regret putting in flip flops. Between a successful thru-hike and a failed attempt that's entirely barefoot, I have to choose the former. I can now concentrate on getting a quad burn on the climbs and a calf burn on the descents, on the vistas and woods and beautiful structures of stone and fault that perpetually surround me. I don't have to be blinded by pain and fear that the evening with be filled with the smell of early-stage gangrene.","Hawk Mountain

Fancy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525882,"The day started with my farewell to Lithuania and a fast push to catch up with Lisa at Woody Gap. The Trail was easy and the day beautiful.At the Gap, the family that had provided me with Yerba Mate tea on the Trail had an RV, tents, and all sorts of soup, fruit, tea, and eggs set up welcoming hikers fit a short stay. They were part of a Christian commune living the life they knew Jesus had wanted people to live: a life of selflessness, sharing, and community. After talking with them and a few hikers for an hour or so, Lisa and I pushed forward.The hiking was a lot of easy ups and downs, crossing over Gaddis(!) Mountain and Turkey Stamp, eventually cresting out atop Blood Mountain, the highest point in the Trail so far. I found out somewhere along the way that someone finally gave Lisa her trail name: SunshineThe shelter was a two-room stone house right on the summit. A spit of rock next to the house looks west where my first real sunset was enjoyed with a guy taking his Siberian husky along for the journey.I turned my phone on to check for water damage, and to my surprise, I had full service. It was flooded with messages, push notifications, and voicemails from the previous few days. I called Julie to let her know how I was doing, and that Hiawassee was more likely to be Thursday since my feet didn't hold up.I made a small fire, then cozied up in my sleeping bag inside the stone shelter. The tarp nailed to a window flapped gently, and a murmur of conversation floated through the walls. Hopefully, no ghosts on Blood Mountain...where did it get a name like that? Bear attacks? Monsters? Murders?","Near Ramrock Mountain

Fancy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525883,"I woke up late, as the billowing tarp on the window kept me up most of the night, not for fear, but for inconstant noise. Everyone was gone, including Sunshine, leaving me to my own devices and raspberry tea.I made my way down to Neel Gap to the outfitter there, getting more stove fuel and more antiseptic. Trail Magic in the form of hamburgers was being prepared, but I pressed on, honestly regretting it. I crave meat right now. Dense, perfect protein.At Tesnatee Gap, I took an hour nap following an apple a guy in a van gave me, and hiked a little ways to Hogpen Gap (They really ought to change these names up. Wouldn't Hogpen Cut or Hogpen Back work just as well?). It was there I ran into RC, a biker with saddle bags filled with Coors Light. He hashed me one and we talked for half an hour. He doesn't a bit of time on the Floribama coast from Perdido Key to Gulf Shores. He warned of a couple of back-to-back frontal systems moving into the area, and that a shelter would be a wise idea. At our goodbye, he handed me another beer (for a around the campfire), and I started up the other side of the cut.I caught up to a seventy-year old thru-hiker, Rocksteady, soon after. While taking plenty of breaks, he keeps passing on, one foot leading the other. His ""Italian friends"" back home would have loved my story concerning the name ""Fancy"". He was a tough old man, and I'm sure he'll do just fine.After crossing Low Gap and passing up the packed shelter, I hiked up another three miles until the sun started setting. I found a campsite right off a ridgeline, having plenty of lee from the coming storm, a close water source, a view between the laurel branches. Hanging my food bag, a carabiner doubled over the branch, unable to be saved. I had to cut the cord and use a replacement. Farewell, old friend! May you hang in glory forever!","Blood Mountain

Fancy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526964,"After the storm RC warned me of, my sleeping bag was once again soaked. Being but a few miles from the gap, I decide to simply pack everything wet and scuttle up and down Blue Mountain to get into Hiawassee as soon as I can. The one water source available to me is a murky, slow trickle out of an old lain PVC pipe, but as I'm out of water, I have no choice.Once I'm at Unicoi Gap, really nothing more than a parking lot and a sign, I start walking down Georgia state road 75/17 as it switches back down the mountain. Four miles later, a guy in a well-traveled Toyota truck picks me up and goes a few miles out of his way to take me to the edge of town. After some walking through the drizzle, I come across Mull's Inn, a rather antiquated, but cozy motel with furnishings from the 70s, to include the sheets and pillowcases, run by a sweet North Georgia woman in her her 60s going by the name Darlene.After so many miles and so little to eat in the past twenty-four hours (two Coors Lights from RC and a 70 calorie pouch of tuna), I was hungrier than I knew how to handle. I make a few phone calls, order an enormous amount of pizza and wings to be delivered, and take an unholy shower. Demons and fallen angels find their way of my body and down the drain, preferably back to the hellfire whence they came.As promised, another thunderstorm rolls in through the night, but I lay warm and snuggled in a dry bed.","Past Low Gap

Fancy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526965,"I slept in until 10. I should feel lazy about it, but you know what? I don't. That's the freedom of the Trail. You make your own schedule and you stick to it...when you want to. I pack up my room, straighten my trash, ate my leftover pizza, and checked out.I headed down to Ingles, a Black Mountain, North Carolina based supermarket chain. I started myself with a Passion tea lemonade from the café Starbucks inside, sat at an outside table and did several hours of work online, including these journal entries, some college red tape, and a few messages. I also made contact with a buddy from the Marine Corps, Jenkins, whose significant other has lodging in Hot Springs, NC. Julie plans to meet me out there, and it will be my first true ""zero"" day, our day hiking zero miles.A college-aged thru-hiker, Hambone Sandwich, and her dog Lucy sat next to me in the afternoon, starting a conversation about her knee injury. It's sidelining her for two weeks, and a shuttle was picking her up in a couple of hours at that very location to take her back to the Trail. When he came around, he agreed to come back to get me when I needed, allowing me time to resupply (tuna and peanut butter) and to mail a letter.The shuttle went to Dicks Creek Gap, technically making me a yellow-blazer, but again, I care not at all. I'll also blue-blaze if its worth it, and in the Shenandoah I'll take the opportunity to aqua-blaze (taking a parallel river).As I get dropped off at the Gap, I wish a farewell to the two old-timers with whom I was shuttling, and start pushing myself. It took a little over an hour and a half to cover four and a half miles of trail to the Plum Orchard Gap Shelter. At Cowert Gap, the most amazing shift of ecological trope happened. The bare, gray branches of the laurel and oaks suddenly sprang forth brown, angular, sharp branches, and the skeletal canopy broke out into green needles. It was a singular wall, a portal from mountain deciduous hardwood, to valley conifers; and as soon as I left the gap, the transformation reversed. The sharp, bitter smell of fermenting needles left, and the familiar ground of pebble and leaf returned.At Plum Orchard Gap, I met White Noise and Bilbo at the front table. After a quick conversation, we all bedded down in the well-engineered three-tiered shelter. Another spat of rain is slowly making its way from the West, morphing the silent forest into a living superbeing full of creaks and whispers.","Hiawassee, Georgia

A fun, lovely group in their mid-20s were all traveling together, but their pace seems just too slow for me.I started quick, and got to the North Carolina boundary before the morning was over. I sat next to a gnarled tree and drank my celebratory Schlitz (so terrible it's amazing) while enjoying the heavenly, fay weather: 45 degrees, breezy, and sunny; and I let several of the group pass by.At Deep Gap, an extraordinary couple, Fieval and Littlefoot, who hiked the AT in 2014 were making veggie burgers for everybody along with chips, salad, and soda. I stayed for an hour, enjoying the food and community.I departed thinking I would stay at the Standing Indian Shelter, before the big climb, but missed the sign, and hiked to the top unexpectedly, all the while cursing myself for having such a slow pace. Despite being the highest point in the Trail so far, there was no view. It was rather disappointing.I continued hiking until I hit Beech Gap, where the group from last night was camping. I made a fire for them, talked a while, then had to get into my sleeping bag and tarp. The wind was growing as the sun set, turning itself into a roaring monster sprinting through the canopy.","Plum Orchard Gap Shelter

Fancy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526967,"(Again, with the gaps!) The morning was frigid, upper 20s at most, and besides a couple of tents still set up, I was the only one left at the site. My positron shifted throughout the night, until I was partially wedged under a moss-covered fallen tree.The first mile took me through a tunnel of eight-foot tall laurels in a deep valley, before lifting off towards the false peaks paying homage to Albert Mountain. Along the way up, two footbridges took me over and by a moss covered spring leaking the cleanest, tastiest water I've had, second only to the spring atop Mount LeConte. The atmosphere, the sound, the soft dripping dark green moss all played a part, I'm sure. The chill of the day lingered well into the afternoon, but by Betty Creek Gap, I could finally remove my fleece.The summit of Albert was 400 yards of a near vertical rock scramble--by far the most strenuous and beautiful climb so far. At the pinnacle was a watchtower with a locked house, but from the top of the stairs, one can overlook not only the recession of foothills to the south, but the craggy peaks of the Smokies. A late-middle-aged couple took a day hike for what seemed like one of their first dates. The woman was from Franklin, and the man from Detroit, having worked on cars since he was 14.The way down was much less steep, but just as beautiful as before. It took me rhododendron tunnels, across springs, and through the north face's deciduous forest pulsing with springtime anticipation. At Long Branch, the Trail not only followed the stream, but was superimposed on it, making me step from stone to stone for a while.The last three miles were the most bizarre so far. It followed the edge of the massif down, but curved around fifteen draws that looked EXACTLY alike. I would curve around the finger, only to see the same trees, the same rocks, the same blazes I saw 200 yards ago. After a little more than an hour of this spiritual torment, I start hearing conversation and laughter, and smell a campfire, signaling the approach to shelter.It was there I met Moose, an overweight trucker who took three weeks to get there. He was a gruff, hilarious retiree who I honestly wish hiked quicker. He would be really fun to have around for a while, as everything around him seemed ripe for a joke.Certainly, a unique day.","Beech Gap

Fancy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526979,"The night before, two guys in polos came to the shelter, offering a free shuttle into the town of Franklin (meanwhile advertising their hostel and hotel for a discounted price). I slept until thirty minutes before it arrived, and made it to the pick up point right on time.My first stop was a massive breakfast at Huddle House, followed by a walk across town to the Ingles, thinking it would be as the other one, with a café and Wi-Fi. Despite the lack of commodity, I found an outside plug and called Julie, and checked the news and weather for the next few days.In the same plaza as Ingles was a Goodwill with a decent fitting pair of shoes. The flip flops held well, but the arch support was breaking my feet, the right one especially. I felt immediate relief upon their wearing. As I said earlier, it's the thru-hike that's important, not the footwear.After a fast food lunch, and a shuttle back to the Trail, I pushed onward. At Silers Bald (the first of its name), a group of far-out, groovy, reefer-smokin' hippies dressed in mostly bandanas and aviators (Yosh the Oracle, and Vanilla among them) recommended I make the side-trail climb to the summit. They were right. It was a clear view better than Albert Mountain, with sight lines in every direction lasting as far as the atmosphere allowed. The Smokies made the northern horizon a few degrees too high, and the flatter ground of South Georgia disappeared after about a hundred miles. The bald itself was lined with scrubby juniper, moss, and grass save for a thicket of short trees down the far side.I kept hiking, passing on two shelters, until I finally arrive at Wayah Bald. A two-story stone tower sits atop the peak, with the most dramatic views in the evening overlooking Franklin: snakes of orange and yellow streetlights slithering through the valley.The wind is cold and strong, and I'm miles from the nearest person...living person.","Rock Gap Shelter

It took a great deal of mental fortitude to pull myself into the open air, put on my (semi-)new shoes and fleece, and pack up. The goal for the day was to get to the Nantahala Outdoor Center, the lowest point on the Trail in the southern section. It wouldn't be strenuous, but I'd be going downhill, WAY downhill for the majority of it.After a few miles, I hit Tellico Gal, where a set of power lines forced the majority of the saddle to be culled. In its stead, a ribbon of soft grass, dandelions, and violets stretched about. The Sun was warm, the ground was cool, so I stretched out...I feel asleep for about an hour. It was a beautiful, perfect nap. I pushed forth from there, and pushed, and pushed, stopping every hour to let my pained feet catch up to where my legs and mind wanted to be.I got into the N.O.C. around 7:15, starving, thirsty, strained, but the reason I pushed--the restaurant--closed at 7.

Remember, it's not the server's fault the food sucks.).While the Trail went upwards, my mood nosedived. After about 3400 feet of elevation gain, and about ten false peaks (where the top of the mountain moves down the path when you think you're there), I finally reach Swim Bald. Of course, the path immediately falls away, and comes back up the other side of a huge gap.Because the AT is flowing the most prominent ridgeline through the Nantahala National Forest, it tends to lack any sense as far as human travel goes. Is it scenic? Sure, the first for it five vistas one comes across. Is it difficult? Absolutely. Is it a path a normal person would take through the mountains. Hahaha. It's a meandering path properly hitting every high point, regardless of the direction.On top of the mental difficulties, my right foot starts flaring up in pain after only five miles, and has been steadily getting worse. I'm not sure if it's a muscular thing, or a skeletal thing. I just know I have to keep going, and the pains going to keep coming.The rain was approaching, with the most the most rain falling around midnight.

Afterwards, they hand out Ziploc bags full of Pop-Tarts, crackers, candy, and drink mixes. It's been awhile since I received any Trail Magic, and this came at a wonderful time.I push onwards, having gotten my backcountry permit for the Smokies from the Fontana Dam Visitor Center. It's a heavy climb up to Shuckstack Tower, an old fire watchtower that's nothing more than a box of rotting wood atop four flights of rickety stairs. The view was fantastic, with sightlines well into Central Tennessee, Fontana Lake and beyond, and a snowcapped Clingman's Dome.After a smuggled beer courtesy Fish-N-Chips, I make the last of the hike of to Mollies Ridge.

The trees were sparse enough to let mottled sunlight drench the grass and rocks, and few enough to let every angle have a view into the draws and valleys below. The wildlife was also much more active with deer and several species of squirrel and bird making a near-constant rustle through the leaf litter. The day was warm enough to keep the shivers away, but cool enough to enjoy the climbs without getting sopped in sweat.The grade of path through the Smokies has been fantastic. There haven't been too dramatic of climbs or descents, and when there's any, it's but a slight lilt. If it continues like this, I'll absolutely fly through this park.

The view from the top was directed at the upcoming behemoth: Clingman's Dome, the highest point on the AT. While the climb up was well-graded, either a sudden bout of altitude sickness (odd considering this isn't above 7000 feet, and that if it were, I would be acclimatized by now), or more likely a severe lack of nutrients struck hard. I wasn't exactly winded, but my legs didn't want to follow my brain's commands and I was quite light-headed. I shoved myself forward, enjoyed the view from the pinnacle's tower, and continued on to Newfound Gap.Along the way, I was hearing rumors of Trail Magic at the Gap, but was thoroughly disappointed.

I cooked a late lunch, watched a van pull up and hand out Powerades, but decided against begging (In hindsight, I think the guy wanted to give me one.)I knew it would be a late day, as I was intending on hiking as far as I did, but I didn't expect an evening as I had. The cloud cover thickened as the Sun went down, giving the already striking, vertigo-inducing views of the northern half an ominous atmosphere. The last ten miles rode a ridgeline with some spots having a steep dropoff within a few feet from either side of the slim pathway. Adding to the nightmarish effect, were extremely heavy winds, swaying the massive pines and firs, and nearly blowing me off the cliff several times.The last hour and a half found me in the pitch darkness save for the twinkling lights of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge to my left.

At the first one, I indulge myself on two packs of ramen with a healthy dose of olive oil mixed in (well...not really mixed in, more of floating atop). My energy slowly returned, and by the second shelter, I was in a good enough mood to crack jokes with the gathering of hikers.The last third saw the sun set on me an hour before I finished for the day. Before that happened, though, some movement caught my eye up the trail. At first, I thought it a fawn by its silence, until I truly focused on it. My next thought was a cub, which sent my parasympathetic nervous system crackling out commands to my fingertips, eyes, and ears. The color was far too light, though, more of a ruddy gray, and its feet far too fleet. It stopped and its turned its head to see what I was doing, showing its striped feline face and black tufted ears. The bobcat immediately restarted it trot up the trail, and despite my best efforts of pursuit, couldn't reclaim a view once it turned into the rhododendrons. The only evidence of its being there were three upturned leaves and a ghost of an imprint in a splotch of horsed up mud. I was originally let down that it was so skittish, but it's truly better for the animal. I'd rather it be hiding in the woods with its litter than as some trophy in some dung-canoe's den.At the shelter, a few embers were still burning despite everyone's slumber.

I explained my intention of hitching up to Hot Springs once I got to Cosby, but she insisted that I come eat something back at the gap, as she was providing Trail Magic until supplies run out. As an exchange for what I thought would be a ride into Cosby, I helped her and her photography club friend (They're from the Leconte Photography Society that focuses on the Smokies.) set up the tables of deli meats, fruits, oatmeal creme pies and coolers of soda. After a couple of hours talking to hikers that walked through, many of whom I had earlier passed, I helped tear everything down and load up the trash and leftovers.

His girlfriend, Macy, has a stake in a motel in Hot Springs, and with all appreciation for their generosity, they hooked me up with a room for a couple of nights. Friday rolls around and we spend the majority of it around town. The Spring Creek Tavern offers a small but excellent selection of local beers and delicious food, and most evenings offers live music from the local talent pool. The check-in process was extremely easy, and the motel manager, Melissa, a die-hard North Carolinian woman with close-cropped hair wearing a Confederate hoodie and Army BDU trousers, spent a good portion of her time getting our room DirecTV access.

The streets were crowded with pedestrians of the Asheville sort: hairy, young, happy, curious faces all. With the pedestrians came the street musicians playing Himalayan singing bowls, Dixieland ensembles, fiddlers, and a few less fortunate people singing heartfelt hymns from within the alleys. We shopped at some used bookstores and vintage shops, though it was painful to know that whatever I found I'd either have to carry on my back or force into Julie's care. At the end of the day I was stuffed with food and beer and spirit. And I still had another day to relax.Sunday was the day we finally visited the springs for which the town was named. It was an hour soak in a tub that fills with naturally heated water and enhanced with jets around the side. In the evening, we camped by the French Broad River in her tent that actually makes ergonomic and structural sense. The poles have an elastic band inside that doesn't feel stretched out, the zippers don't get caught on pointless flaps of fabric, and the corners actually stretch out into their proper shape and don't get pulled back in by the warped skeleton. We built a fire and drank beer into the night talking about possible futures. It was the perfect way to get ready for the upcoming trek across the Roan Highlands and Northeastern Tennessee.This whole weekend was one of the best I've ever had.

He fought in Vietnam with a regiment reinforced with New Zealand troops.I got back on the Trail mid-morning and begin a long, sometimes hard climb up the shoulder of the Bald Mountains massif. At Low Gap, once I crossed under I-26, a Tennessee native with a 90s model F-250 diesel was passing out water, tangelos, and apples. He was also passing news that another wildfire has been burning up the Roan Highlands and shuttles are taking hikers around the inferno. It was also confirmed as arson. Some idiot thought it would be funny to destroy some of America's most beautiful countryside.I continued the climb up to the triplet peaks, watching the fair weather cumulus and occasional lenticular slowly turn into cirrostratus and curious congestus; a front was fast approaching. I might not make this a night hike after all.At the top of Big Bald--aptly named--rolling hills of open grassland spread out before me. The Sun had dipped below the now-present horizon a few minutes before. The wind was bending the taller grass stalks down to the ground, and the few thickets of oak and hemlock in the crevices were roaring in protest. To the south, thick indigo clouds rolled about on top of a wall of rain. To the west, the last bit of red lighting up this part of the world was slowly fading. To the north, the lights of Erwin, Tennessee snaked through the valley, its residents cozy in their warm sheets and blankets. It was a beauty I've only experienced on the ridgeline between Mount Cammerer and Mount Guyot in Smokies: stark, ragged, dangerous beauty.I made it to the shelter before the storm, and with enough light left to set up my tent without a headlamp. I fell asleep to the sound of increasing rain and angry trees.","Hiker's Paradise

Fancy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529567,"I woke up a little later than I wished: I wanted to make it into Erwin by lunchtime. A guy with a thicker Georgia accent, Rooster, is at the table, and after talking a while we realize we have the same plan of hitching into Erwin.We separated for a while as I pulled ahead. The rain had picked back up, and at times came down hard enough to get through and beneath my rain coat. The Trail had turned into rocks, puddles, and mud, giving every step the hazard of taking one's feet away from where they should have been. About two miles from US-19W I encountered two freshly fallen trees across the path. The first was easy enough to get over, but the second was an old, girthy oak that sat nearly at chest height. There was no room to crawl under and with the loose earth and steep ground, going around it was impossible. I jumped as high as gravity allows, and attempted a full-body straddle. While I made it, one of the failing straps on my waist pouch finally ripped off. I threw it to the other side while I manoeuvred myself to the other side. I found what I thought was a stable spot for my left foot, planted it, and--slwooop! The ground and half the Trail gave way and took me on a five-foot ride down the mountain. I climbed hand-over-hand back to the path and continued on, now covered in mud.I arrived at the crossing with Rooster not too far behind. The lack of traffic was a little troubling, but I figured any traffic coming through here would be on their way to Erwin. Rooster took his pack off and took his phone out, hoping for reception. After thirty minutes and two vehicles heading west, I left my pack and walked up the road, hoping the other side of the gap would get me something. Of course, there was nothing for a T-Mobile customer.An hour later, two hikers show up and say a shuttle is on its way. They're heading to the Super 8 in Erwin. Like a deus ex machina, our salvation arrived.We split a room at the hotel, and go our own ways that evening. I end up not going to bed until the small hours of the next morning.","Bald Mountain Shelter

Fancy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529569,"Despite the late night, I got up early enough for a free breakfast of a bagel and a danish. I mulled about the room, wondering where I should go next. I had yet to do laundry, and wanted somewhere I could plug my phone in. A laundromat seemed like the appropriate choice.
I walked the three quarters of a mile, and noticed a lack of cars, hikers, or lights outside. It was closed. I had muddy clothes, filthy socks, and a phone that was almost dead. I was also presently wearing a fleece getting far too warm, and rain pants that prevented the sweat from breathing away. The afternoon was going to be interesting.
Downtown, everything closed an hour before I got to it. It seems that Saturdays were a day where tourist-driven profits weren't a high priority. The owner of the Steel Rails Café, however, was generous enough to get me a hot tea and show me a sound stage near his building with plugs. At least I could charge my phone and call everyone.
In my quest for food, Google directs me to Rendizvous [sic]. It's a local bar that serves pickled eggs, nachos, and domestic beers. I decide to give it a chance and sit down to a couple of Rolling Rocks. The strangers immediately were talking to me in thick East Tennessee accents, most of which were amplified by a smoker's husk, the bartender was a high-energy, goofy woman in her late thirties that smoked behind the counter. It was a bar scene straight from my imagination of what a warm mountain watering hole would be like. I spent a few hours there, to include a karaoke cover of ""Wagon Wheel"", enjoying a slice of Erwin night life.
Afterwards, I took the long walk back to Trail, and slept under the stars near an outfitter.","Erwin, Tennessee
