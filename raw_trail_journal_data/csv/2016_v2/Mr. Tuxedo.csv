Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540868,"Well it was kind of a disaster, but a disaster mitigated with some lessons learned at least. Kate and I planned a 3 night hike in the uwharrie national forest about an hour and a half west of raleigh. The goal was to test out our new hammocks and see how our pack weights felt (30 and 35 with 3L of water), break in the shoes a bit more etc. It was 90+ degrees and 100% humidity, so very swampy/soaked hiking and not exactly what we'll get in ME and NH which I take some comfort in. We also couldn't find a spot to leave the dog, so Marley came along with us and was generally a pain keeping an eye out for. Bless his heart, but I hate him right now and hope he enjoyed his last overnight backpacking trip ever. We hiked a couple miles in the first night and had a nice spot by a great creek. We're not exactly skilled hammock slingers yet, but we still got them up pretty quick and they were way more comfortable than tent sleeping. It was getting much lower than 70 at night so I didn't need the sleeping bag, air mattress or even a makeshift pillow for that matter. Biggest downside I see of hammocks is being separate from Kate every night, but all the rest are positive. We didn't get any torrential downpour, just a bit of rain, so that still remains to be seen how my tarp holds up. I got a Hennessy asymp zip that has a much smaller, but lighter, tarp compared to kate's warbonnet superfly contraption. It's basically a floating tent. Pretty cool just weighs a pound more and I'm going to wait until the first storm to see if I need a tarp upgrade too. There are mixed reviews online.2nd day was tough hiking in that heat. Just more soaking wet the whole time. We received several ""hot enough for ya?""'s from some folks we passed and Kate decided that hiking in the Amazon was not something she ever needs to do. After about 9 miles we stopped for lunch and had doubts about our 15 mile goal for the day. Then the water filter broke, followed by the squeeze bag. In the process some unfiltered water got in my water pouch and it was either drink that or roll the giardia dice even more and go straight from this barely non-stagnant stream (we think we're in the clear but might have another day or so to find out for sure =]) We each had about 2L at that point. The thought of running out of water in that heat was no bueno, so we were planning our bailout. Luckily i've got the mountain bike project app as well as the hiking project app on my phone and when we stopped for lunch right by one of the mountain bike fire roads, kate had the idea to check the mileage and it was a mile and half shorter than the uwharrie rec trail. That turned out to be key because we ran out of water around a mile and a half out and the dehydration was not fun. Lesson learned! We still like the sawyer straw for its light weight but we'll be carrying two of them with one in the bounce box from now on.",,gear test fail,"Jul 03, Sun",0
Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542760,"Gear is packed and I'm sitting at the cincinnati airport trying to get to bangor.  We still have a chance.  We were originally on united connecting in Chicago but the crew never showed up.  Since we were going to miss our connection, which, I mean, would've happened anyway at ohare, they booked us on an American flight going through DC instead.  After being aggressively friendly with several airline minions who hate their lives I finally got through to a ground guy with soul in tact and actually got to watch him take care of business and get our bags from United to american.  Thanks be to that dude!  Fingers crossed that round two pans out.  With anything having to do with flying, I just repeat my mantra ""there's no end to their depravity"" and deal.  As it stands we get to bangor at 5 instead of 11am, and our bus to millinocket leaves at 630.  
Ive currently got about 33000 calories of food in my pack, which weighs 44lbs without water!    After weighing my pack last night I got super depressed and scared at the thought of a 50 lb pack weight.  It's supposed to be one day of food for katahdin and ten days for the 100 mile wilderness.  I was going to add even MORE food to up the calories but I just can't bear it.  I might even shed some calories and just lose some weight in the first week.  We can probably get through the wilderness in 7 days anyway.   
As far as the rest of the gear so far i just need to buy fuel, toilet paper and i forgot my pack cover.  Luckily were staying at the AT Lodge in millinocket and it looks like they've got a good hiker supply store.
I think I figured out how to add a photo to the post. If it works there's the fam before shipping out our NC home. I only cried a little bit leaving marley in cbus but he's in great hands (thanks matt and jess!). I already miss the south and hope it's extra motivation to walk back down there. I mean, English muffins instead of biscuits and ""you guys"" instead of ""y'all"" to address my female wife and me?! C'mon.",,airline depravity,"Jul 19, Tue",0
Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544084,"That was an awesome hike.  Even a bit more epic than I had imagined.  The hunt trail up to katahdin starts off pretty tame, as I suppose everything must, but then once out of the treeline it's basically a series of V0 and V1 bouldering routes.  So not that bad except if you slip you might die, and throw in some 30 mph gusts for goid measure.  Lots of super skinny ridges with scree and lose rock.   I saw a girl carrying a chalk bag and got a bit jealous.  Besides the wind we really lucked out with the weather.  It was panoramic clear views of shear faced granite cliffs, woods, and ponds.  Definitely a good reason to go nobo.  I had a great time, but when kate and i took the pic at the top with thr iconic sign, we were marking trail mile 0.  Thr climb didnt count.  I can't imagine what it must be like to end the trail with that climb.  And that's the hardest, most technical climb of the AT!  Done.    we were a bit scared of the climb down because the wind was picking up to 40, but it ended up being much easier, probably because we knew what to expect and where the gnar-bar sections were.  
There's another infamous trail up there called knifes edge, rated as the most dangerous in the east or some such.  I was tempted to do it while we up there but was glad I didn't.  This other sobo kid Justin we'd started with in bangor did it and busted his knee.  He thinks it's game over.  Poor guy.
That night we took advantage of the firewood for sale at the campground and hung the hammocks by katahdin stream","airline depravity

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544089,"Much flatter trail today.  Still lots of roots, rocks and bog bridges but it was still pretty easy going.  Baxter is really beautiful.  Didn't really see many other people. Just a couple of nobos bout to finish and a trail steward.  We stopped at a beautiful waterfall for some snacks and it was pretty sweet to be all alone in miles if protected wilderness.  Made me feel pretty grateful to be out here.  I had some bug management issues later on but after talking with other hikers this is what mainers call ""zero bugs"" so I should count my blessings.  I'm deetin it up tomorrow tho for sure.  
About 10 miles in we came to the abol bridge store. The last stop before 100 mile wilderness, and they had beer!  Kate and I had a Baxter ipa and split some cheese sticks to celebrate day 2.  I realized I was dehydrated when I was halfway through the beer and was completely wasted.  So I hydrated, we took off and now we're in the 100 mile wilderness.  Hurdle two coming up!","katahdin stream campground
",Hurd brook lean to,"Jul 21, Thu",13.40
Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544093,"Currently hanging comfortably in my hammock at a stealth site near the pollywog stream.  Today was a long but good day.  Feeling really good about pulling close to a 15 mile day considering kate started out on the struggle bus.  We hung our hammocks without the tarp, which is great to see the trees and stars while falling asleep.  But around 5 or so there was a light drizzle which got us going pretty quick.  It gets light out here around then anyway so that's when we should be up regardless.  Just haven't fully adapted to hiker time yet.  Kate was kinda nauseous and tired from the start which had us both worried.  The first 4 miles we were clocking like 1.2 mph and we weren't sure how much farther we'd get.  Then it kinda just passed.  She got some food down finally, the weather cleared up a bit and we were off.  We climbed a little mountain and the peak was COVERED in blueberries.  There was a view of a cloud covered katahdin and it just seemed magical.
We were cooking from there until we crapped out by a stream for lunch.  At that point we were totally exhausted and planned to slog it out to the Hurd brook lean to about 4 miles away.  With the help of some caffeine pills we cruised there gabbing our heads off.  !Dame la cafeína! I've been too lazy to make tea in th he morning and it was sorely missed.  The lean two had a swimming hole and was another dose of magic.  Cleansing the stank and swamp ass all alone in bouldery cliff rapids was just the best.  We felt so good after that we ignored the rumbling thunder and left the group at the shelter to head for the current spot.  Thought we were in for a thorough drenching but we lucked out.  
Still got some kinks to work out with setting up camp efficiently and avoiding the nightly bug massacre but hell, we got time.  Tonight I  was so tired I after the chores I  didn't even play ny guitar.  And now it's like 1030 pm and I'm still awake writing this!  Way past hiker bedtime.","Hurd brook lean to
",pollywog stream,"Jul 22, Fri",14.40
Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544094,"Tonight we camped at tumbledown dick stream, not far from tumbledown dick falls.  
An otherwise pretty great day was tainted by an unusually massive onslaught of bugs in the last couple miles.  My number one regret of the trip so far is not applying permethrin to all my clothes beforehand.  Decicco left a whole bottle of it in my car that's just been sitting there for months and from reports I was hearing of a ""really good"" bug conditions I didn't use it.  We stopped for a break with a father and son, expendable and squirrel, who had a nice fire going and I picked up a bunch of black fly bites while they were totally unfazed with their treated clothes.  We both were kind of delirious and exhausted after that stressful break and stopped short of our 15 mile goal.  I bathed in 100% deet and put my rain hood on and just sweated through dinner.
The plus side is everything before that was good Ole majestic goodness.  We climbed nesuntabunt mtn and got enough cell signal to find out kate passed her boards!  The official end of a 9 year study binge.  Just wish we had champagne to celebrate.  I tried to give her the trail name dacvim but she grumped.  We skirted around beautiful foothill lakes after that, impressed by how fast the loons swim under water then pop up from out of nowhere.  Then we got our first bit of trail magic: some apples left before one of the last climbs if the day.  
It's now actually the morning after and we're getting another late start while kate and her GI tract are working through an argument they had this morning.  Today's the last flatish bit of the wilderness and we were hoping to do 17 to get to our food drop but it's probably not worth pushing that out at thus point.  Looking like it will take us 10 days to do the wilderness after all.  Which is really no big deal.  When you meet and leap frog with other sobos it's hard to not have a race mentality a bit, but it's a marathon not a sprint.  Actually like 100 marathons, so yeah....best to let your body decide the miles.","pollywog stream
",tumbledown dick stream,"Jul 23, Sat",12.60
Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544095,"We're hanging at a stealth site that I think is on cooper pond, but I can't be sure from awol's guide.  It's probably a good quarter mile down a blue blaze trail. :/  it's a good one tho and this far off the trail I can do tarp off pants off!  Met another sobo matt who's camped a bit further down, and he said this spot was on guthook's app.  Seems like a lot of water sources and other stealth sites ate on there but not awol, so we're thinking of shelling out the 60 bucks to get it when we get to monson.  If it works like the mtb or hiking project app that'd be pretty cool, just battery dependent.  
Kate felt a lot better after a nap this morning and we were off by 11am or so, so it was a pretty chill today.  There was a gorgeous sand beach on jo Mary lake and we got another great swim in.  Man, swimming is the best.  Just me and Kate in the middle of nowhere with a huge, beautiful lake all to ourselves.  Doesn't get much better.  Such a shot in the arm.  
I did much better at bug management today, with only one brief freakout during a bathroom break.  The trick is at around 430 or 5 I liberally apply deet and then make sure to start setting up camp by 530 or 6.  That way we avoid the bug rush hour when the sun sets.  We just need to get up and go to bed earlier in general. Once I get to camp I zip on my pant legs and get my rain jacket handy if necessary.  Although today I think we swatted like 2 mosquitos and a couple of poor friendly beetles by mistake at camp. 
Tomorrow morning we're going to try for a bigger mileage day.  And climb a little bit up from the base of white cap mtn, which looks like a lungbuster.   Get up early and go try to spot a moose in the pond while getting water, hike 9 miles or so to our food drop, and then start making our way OUT of the 100 mile wilderness.  We're both now on the longest backpacking trip we've ever been on.","tumbledown dick stream

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544096,"We're hanging at the Logan brook lean-to at around 2500' and it's a bit rainy and windy.  I'll take rain and wind over bugs any day.  Anything yo grt out of that damn bog.  This will be the first rain and wind test for my hammock.  I'm pretty snug and weighted the ends of my tarp down so am feeling confident.  I did leave a little breezeway do well see how I feel in the morning.  
The last climb was tough going but I'm really glad we pushed through.  That was nearly 17 miles, a record for us both.  Met a bunch of sobos at the shelter today that all seem like good people:  mcmuffin, thunder?, moose, and blonde bear.  It's weird to actually address people by the trail names.  Right now we're still just kate and rob and people look so confused wen we tell them real names.  I bet there are a lot of people who end up with names like ""just x"".  
Earlier today I had a nice swim at cooper brook falls shelter.  It's fun to swim in the rapids; kinda like an infinity pool.  I picked up a cute little leech friend too!  He hadn't attached to my wrist yet so I just scraped him off.  It was still worth the swim!  But Kate decided not to join me after that.  Met a nice couple there, Christina and preston.  We may actually see them again.  The other sobos we've met recently are all busting out 20+ miles a day.  It's always good to ask people's miles when you meet them, so you know if you need to remember their name or not.   That guy mike, aka beaver now apparenthly, we met last night I'd pulling 25 a day , so it's like, nice to meet you, see you again never!
Tomorrow we've got a big climb of white cap mountain taking us close to 4000 again followed by more ups and downs so well prob tone back the mileage a bit.  Only 40 miles and some change left to the wilderness.  Can't wait to gorge some town food and have a few beers.","cooper pond

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544097,"Today was a fun day of challenging climbs and beautiful views.  Kate got a big head start on me leaving the shelter, so after I was packed up I decided to eat my breakfast on the go while starting the climb up white cap.  I'd forgotten that we were already mid climb from the shelter, and trying to climb 2000 ft over 1.4 miles without using poles while eating pop tarts was not ideal.  Afterwards though, in full-go mode, it was an honest day's work and I enjoyed it.  We climbed White cap, hay, West Peak and Gulf hagas.  Kate was so tired she dry cried at lunch and we decided to call it a day at 7 miles.  Felt like 20 miles and I was happy to chill at the shelter and work on the same 2 classical guitar pieces I've been trying to learn for a decade (tarrega's recuerdos de la ahlambra and segovia's version of bach's prelude in something for cello, in case you didn't know).  We met a really nice couple, rangely and precip, and just hung out.  Rangely is finishing up a 4 year section hike and independently mentioned that she recently was so tired she cried.  Apparently that's a thing   
The privy there was another luxurious one that smelled of freshly cut pine.  Next to the toilet was the first privy graffiti that I actually enjoyed reading.  It said, ""oh beautiful privy, I am not worthy to receive you.  But only say the word and my rectum shall be relieved""","Logan brook lean to

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544100,"Today was a tough one for me.  I was sluggish and Kate was killing it.  The morning was nice and easy, but then we made the terrible mistake of not getting more water when we forded the west branch if the pleasant river.  We'd heard that the spring at chairback gap was dry, but not that EVERY water source on chairback mtn was dry.  That meant 6+miles of several steep climbs on the water I'd gotten 4 miles ago.  Even with water I was struggling on the first climb and just generally feeling poopy.  I choked down a salmon tortilla, then vowed to never eat that salmon again.  I then broke my Spork trying to swat a black fly a bnd next spilled salmon juice over my awol guide page.  Glad bears aren't a problem here!  A few miles later I went dry and stumbled delirious until finally getting to a running stream.  We crashed at a stealth site at the base of 4th mountain soon after that.","Carl a.

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544101,"Hiked up 4th mountain and cloud pond hill or whatever it's called.  Those were some more lung busters and reminders that I need water to survive.  I wish I didn't because cloud pond is a steep .4 miles off trail.  Beautiful but mileage don't count towards GA, GRR.  I got water with a frog friend at the pond and then kate and I got super lucky and waited out a torrential down pour in the shelter while feasting on some mac and cheese.  Later in the day, not so lucky.  We had heard from several nobos that there was some top notch trail magic (cookout, beer, liquor) up ahead and that got us salivating.  I've learned to not really trust anything from nobos, or hikers in general for that matter, because most spend a decent chunk of their day a bit delirious and you don't want to pin your hopes, dreams, or survival on mileage estimates from crazy people.  But we had two independent sources give the exact same coordinates for this magic!  Unfortunately the sky opened up again and we got our first taste if really soaking wet hiking.  Which must've also washed out the magic.  When we knew we had missed it and our hopes were dashed, it wasn't long before we crapped out for the day.  Oh well.  At least the rain cleared out and I had some nice dry clothes and a hammock to kick it in.","mt. 3.5

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544102,"We're out of the 100 mile wilderness!  Oh man it was good to see that sign.  Jyst knowing we were zeroing in on it left a shit eating grin on ny face.  The one for nobos you can actually read what it says.  Today was easier terrain than the last few. Which could be reality or just extra motor knowing we were getting beer and pizza tonight.  There have been a couple climbs that I've gotten myself up by chanting ""beer and pizza"" over and over again.  That usually morphs into that song by Bill Callahan called ""the sing"" where the chorus is ""the only two things I've said today are 'beer' and 'thank you'"".  Then he repeats.  Look it up! It's a good one.  The other good mountain climber is the tame impala tune called ""gotta be above it"" where that's repeated over and over.  Hey, whatever it takes.  But I digress.    Earlier in the day we came across a gaggle of quebecoise at a shelter and I got to practice my french a bit.  They were polite but clearly waiting for me to sod off, and I obliged.  It's cool seeing shelter log entries in french.  There  have been a few times I've almost gone to Montreal for a spell to really make a dent in that language and it still hasn't happened.  
 When we got to ME 15 we tried to hitch with no luck and then called shaws and got a room that includes shuttling.  That was a goid move.  Shaws people are awesome and before we even had our pack off they got us a PBR.  So good!  And theyve got a piano and classical guitar which wad really refreshing to play.  I miss my piano a lot.  
We met a fellow sobo, Flicker, who shares our garage bunk house and headed to the lakeshore for a glorious dinner.  Trail towns are cool because you're pretty much a temporary local while you're there. Ran into dan, aka macroman, and we ""closed"" the place down with 2 beers each.  Doesn't take much to get trashed when you're calorie deprived.  The stars are amazing here.  You can see the milky way spirals clear as a bell.","pre-wilson valley lean to

Met a lot of cool nobos about to finish and flip floppers starting their second leg.  Apparently it's pretty dry and hot in VA and as lot if nobos are switching to a flip flop.  And we also ran into Christina and preston!   They're debating a bail.  Apparently they weren't doing so hot in th ed wilderness and Christina made a deal with God that if he got them outta there she'd go to church on sunday.  Well they came across an MATC crew that gave them a ride back to monson, tomorrow's Sunday and she says she's goin!

I remembered to pick up some olive oil and hot sauce which I'm pretty excited about.  I really like these knorr meals with all the fixins.  You can get them up close to 1000 calories and the whole meal is like 2 bucks.  
The trail was really gentle today with no big climbs.  Just following the pisquo-something river all day.  That was fine by us because we both were nursing some aches and pains most of the day.  I think tomorrow I'm starting off with some preemptive drugs since we actually have to climb a mountain in the morning.","monson

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544457,"At another stealth site, mid climb of pleasant pond mountain.  We got a nice second wind today I think due to the availability of sour patch kids, swedish fish and caffeine pills.  I am all about the candy and candy bars right now, which I normally can't stand.  But if they have sour patch kids at the resupply tomorrow I might get a pound.  
Tomorrow we're gonna hit carratunk and grab some lunch or dinner, and some beers at this brewpub/outfitter.  The tricky part is that after town is the Kennebec river which is the longest water crossing of th ed whole trail and you're supposed to take a free ferry across.  It only runs 9-2 though and there's no camping allowed near the river shore.  Our plan is to not pay to camp or rent a room but we'll see how easy that is.  In the guide book there's talk of a hottub, which if real that might trump all else.  
Today was fun climbing bald mountain and it was nice to get some good views again.  My ankle area is still a little tender and swollen si I was a bit slow going, but steady at least.  We met another sobo today, Marty mcfly on the bald top.  He's another guy that doesn't filter water.  I wonder if you get lucky long enough if you're just immune to giardia.  That might even be worth it if there was a way to condition yourself.  Filtering water is such s time suck.  Speaking of which, all the water sources are still really low or non existent.  We haven't gone dryer anything but a lot if the streams are stagnant and the fords are just rock hops.

But it was broken and that was the last straw.  We bailed and hitched with some nobos back to the trailhead.  
Hiking today was an easy 10 miles with just a couple climbs, but my ankle/foot thing is still bothering me and it was slow going.  Really hope that gets better soon before hitting some if these bigger ME mountains.  I think it may just be a bruise but I'm gonna take it easy again tomorrow.  The first part of the trail someone else paddles my gimp ass along in a canoe anyway!","mid pleasant pond mtn

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544683,"We're hanging on the shore of West carry pond and it's great.  We went swimming, made dinner then watched the sun set over the lake and listened to the loons' calls echoing.  It was really cloudy and the lake was like an abstract mirror of the mountains and sky.  Just sitting on a tiny little dock watching everything go down and eating oreos.  We got a little rain shower earlier but I got my hammock tarp up in porch mode and got to eat my food staying dry.  The shelter's a ways up the hill without a view of the lake.  
This morning Paul made us a stellar breakfast.  I got up around 6, updated my journal and drank like 8 cups of coffee chatting with Paul and then the other sobos.  When it was all said and done, the bill for kate and I in a private double bed, both our resupply's, a milkshake and snacks, laundry, and ayce breakfast was 68 bucks.  Not frickin bad.  That dude and his place are wonderful.  
We got to the ferry by 9 and got to meet this really sweet ferry dog as we all waited for the canoe to bring over the first batch of nobos.  The hiking was super easy and my foot and ankle didn't hurt once!  i saw a lot more beaver dams, beaver bogs, anf beaver canals.  Beavers are pretty cool and are abundant up here.  A couple of times a beaver dam has actually been the AT.   Anyway, I'm cautiously optimistic that it was just a bruise from repeatedly smacking my right foot into the left that will be gone tomorrow too.  That'd be pretty convenient because tomorrow we start a slew of 4000 footers starting with the bigelows.  This is a lot if folks' favorite part of the trail and I'm pretty excited.  It's gonna be a workout thpugh.  Climbing nearly 3000 feet for starters tomorrow.","caratunk

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544684,"Today was an epic day with an epic finish.  It felt like climbing katahdin and when I looked it up we climbed nearly 5000 ft and descended 2 or 3 thousand.  I was feeling pretty ragged near the end of the climb of Avery peak, but then the sun was just over the Ridgeline as I climbed above treeline and started back lighting a lot of trail features just as the views turned 360.  That was pretty great.  We're in the bigelows and I had my sights set on getting to 4000 ft all day.  The best part about Avery peak was that we got to see it a lot beforehand and it looked like a monster.  From little Bigelow peak we saw the twin tips of Avery and big Bigelow 5 miles away or so and thought ok, we're camping in between those tonight!  The base if Avery peak had some  really cool boulders too.  Giant things that seemed to have their own weather patterns as you scrambled through them.    Oh and for fellow sobos, there's a lot of spring water up here too.  I wish I'd have known that because the maps made it seem like we'd be dry so I had 5L of water with me.  
I also thought the campsite would be empty because of that but we're in full audio range of a gaggle of prepubescent boys and their college age chaperons.  We couldn't stealth somewhere with our hammocks either because it's all fragile alpine environment and you have to stay on the trail or designated sites.  It's kind of annoying, especially hearing the guides bark out orders on the procedural steps the kids must follow in order to receive their chocolate and marshmallow tortilla, but it's pretty amusing too.   I thought Kates head was gonna explode at all the food talk.  Justin was strongly castigated for getting chips in the salsa.  In return he started lashing out a kid who took real offense and called him a goober.  Then HE was called inappropriate and he countered with, ""well YOU'RE inappropriately ugly!""  That's a pretty good one and I'll probably use it later when the time is right. At one point the whole gang left for a night hike leaving all the food unguarded.  I mulled over raiding it and making it look like a bear did it.  I didn't though.  
I'm in my cold weather gear in the hammock with the wind whipping and so far it's holding up pretty good.  I'm toasty and not really using my sleeping bag.  It's hard to tell when I'll need a warmer bag and/or underquilt for the hammock.  I know in the whites it can get down to 20 this time of year still and that might be pushing it with my current set up.  I should be OK if I just set my hammock up as a tent on the ground though.  If I can get through the whites with this gear I'd be set until late fall in the smokies most likely.","West carry pond lean to

We didn't want to shell out for a room in town so we started the climb out around 7 after resupplying and getting pizza in town. We were about to set up camp at a pretty crappy spot when I spotted this clearing across the trail. Must be a spot locals use because there's no path to it, it's a couple hundred feet aways and it's got room for 5 tents and a fire ring. It was a pretty slow going day descending from the bigelows. Some more pretty terrain. We had first lunch at a nice mountain pond near horns pond lean to with some other nice sobos, jd and lily, that we've been leapfrogging with.

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545174,"I misinterpreted the guidebook multiple times today, but the most recent screw up ended up as frickin great. We're in a heated lift operator box at the summit of sugarloaf mountain; I think about as high as well be until the whites at 4200 and some change. The mistake is that we're .6 mile climb OFF the trail. AWOL isn't exactly exhaustive on the water sources, and I passed up several thinking they weren't the ones referenced on the climb up the crockers. I was kinda tired and locking to call it a day. I just glanced at the guide and saw there was water and a view where the trail on sugarloaf plateaus a bit.   I didn't see that water was .2 and the view was .6 straight up to the sugarloaf peak. Being out of water and hearing from a couple nobos that the next water was 3 or 4 miles ahead, had to climb. Then did the same damn thing and ended up at the summit. Long story long, some kind soul leaves the lift box, which has a lock, unlocked. I'm sure it's technically trespassing (incidentally internet, all of this post is a lie for dramatic effect) but it seems there's an unspoken agreement that as long as you're out by 9 before a patrol sees you, and you cleanup and be respectful etc, that this is basically an AT shelter. It's so ridiculously nice. There's a toaster oven and power strip. I just melted cheese on toasted bagels and watched the sun set and moon rise over panoramic mountains, with the wind ripping outside and Kate and I on a plush reclinING chair. I played guitar on a picnic table in the SECOND room before going to bed. It's like a private free motel room. First time weve had d to sleep on the grouMD too so thankful were doing the cheaper option of thermarests in the hammock. Anyway I could obviously rave on. I'm sure other stuff happened today too. Of note, kate got stuck in a torrential down pour while negotiating a steep rock slide pile descent. She's unharmed but took away a bent pole badge of honor after a spill. I'm a pretty sure footed hiker and I was baby stepping down that section in perfect weather. I can't imagine.","stealth past stratton

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545175,It sucks when the first .6 miles of your day don't count. Still worth it to have stayed up there though. Kate even went .4 NORTH because she missed the admittedly crappy water sources on the way off sugarloaf then backtracked to a stream. But whatever it was a good hiking day. We had a nice lunch at Overton stream then climbed over Saddleback junior and decided to stop short of the horn.

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545178,"It was nice fast 8 miles into town and we're looking forward to our second zero, or less judgementally, donut day (thanks james) in rangeley. We shelled out for a nice room at the farmhouse and had a fancy meal with wine in town to finally celebrate kate passing her boards. There had been a bachelor party at the hostel recently and they had donated a ton if food and beer to the hiker box. So that more than made up for the extra expense. The place was full of nice sobos we hadnt met yet too. I only discriminate here because of late we've run across some snarky nobos, which thankfully are in the minority but we must've just been passing thru a rough patch of em. To the point, there was a nobo today, who I think goes by popper, who stopped just to give me a worthers candy while I was huffing up some climb. And he apparently makes a habit if doing that for climbing sobos. That was so nice it inspired me to do the same when I've got my sour patch kids handy. It's pretty easy to be the magic. Although one lady flatly refused and looked at me like an ax murderer when I offered (I suspect she's either a day hiker or completely mental), the next guy lit up like a birthday cake gave me the reverence of Santa. And all for the small price of a couple sour then sweet gummies. We made excellent time into rangeley due in no small part to kate's competitive side getting stoked but a couple of fast day hiking teens on our tail off of saddleback. Saddleback was one of my favorites too. We lucked out with the weather and it was a few great miles of above treeline, 360 views. A couple fun boulder scrambles too.","Redington stream campsite

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545917,"Zero day número 2!  It felt very choresy though since I had some lingering emails to respond to that I'd put off for months and was starting to hate myself for how much a slacker I'd been.  Got em done though.  Felt weird to do stats in a cute resort town library.  Surprise surprise there was no statistical software on the library computer so I had to use some extreme mental math, basically guessing.  I didn't bring my phone into town either so getting into my Gmail was actually herculean task.  There were five security options, only one not involving my phone.  One of the security questions was what month and year did I open my Gmail account.  That was like 12 years ago!, what month?!.  I kept answering it wrong and getting frustrated and somehow it eventually let me in.  So much for security questions.  
We had a great breakfast lox at moosely's that morning with mcfly and Anthony, then put zed around town for resupply and had a beer and watched some Olympics at a sports bar.  the town had our first big supermarket, an iga, and they had liquor!  I got a couple airplane bottles if bourbon.  Nothing like a nip or hot tea toddy n a cold night end of a long day.","rangely me

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545918,"We got a shuttle to the trail from the farm house at 730 sans town breakfast, which was a bummer.  I was jonesing for another lox bagel frome moosely's and had gotten up early to have time to hitch into town and back.  I was calling to place the order waiting for a hitch and there was no answer.  Luckily a farm house guy walked by and I mentioned they must be opening late and he told me oh yeah, they're closed wednesdays.  At least I didn't go all the way in to find that out.  Farmhouse was great but I'm not a big fan of out of town hiker hostels.  This was only like 1.5 miles out but it feels like you're a teenager without a license asking your folks if they can drive you around.  
Anyway, nothing special on the day.  Just relatively easy miles out of town.  I got a nice swim in at sabbath day pond and ran into our new rangely sobo friends, legs and shepherd with her awesome dog bela. ( I'm Mr. Tuxedo by the way.  Not sure i ever mentioned my trail name in here. ) Who apparently doesn't swim and can't stand clapping.  Pretty weird for such a smart, normal looking aussie/collie mix.  Shepherd smacked a bug on her arm and bela got up and went to the other side of the beach in protest, clearly pissed off.  
On the way down to the road to oquossoc we started passing some weird people.  One even tried to find out where kate was gonna be camping, so pretty freaky.  That made me even more wary of sleeping near a road but we knew there'd be a crowd of sobos there at least.  Rolling into the campsite we missed yet another awesome trail magic cookout.  The sign was still out but a nobo relished in telling us we just missed it.  To cap it all off, and I'm so mad at myself, I got impatient with a can of clams when my Leatherman didn't have a good can opener.  I was thinking to myself this is probably a bad idea as I was forcing it and I sliced open my thumb.  I'm so bad with blood and I knew it'd be a bad cut so it was great t have Dr kate to help.  She bandaged it up and gave it a 3/10 in severity which I didn't believe but gave me hope I'd play guitar again since she's usually a worst case scenario prognosticator.  It's on the left side of my right thumb so hopefully shouldn't give me issues with the poles tomorrow.  First trail injury!  And it's a bone head cooking flesh wound.  So upset with myself.","rangeley

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545920,"Another wet day only this time from rain.  I was actually praying for rain at the beginning I was so sick of the heat and humidity.  How quickly your body adjusts to the new normal.  I would not have even called this humidity back in NC.  Eventually though I was just wet and not particularly thrilled about.  We pushed on in the rain after lunch at least knowing we'd be having a town dinner.  
When we finally got to the road the hitching situation didn't look to promising.  There were a half dozen nobos who'd been waiting there an hour and had only seen 2 cars that didn't stop.  Then kate and I and one more nobo showed up.  There was zero cell service so I wasn't too hopeful as it was a barely paved side road.  Ended up not being an issue at all though.  Some dude in a suburu picked up the whole first group and shortly thereafter a truck swooped the remaining three of us.  He was a couple beers into a six pack of Sam adams oktoberfest and gave us each one, instinctively opening the bottles with his seat belt.  It was 5 o clock on a Friday and he seemed experienced so I wasn't too concerned.  It was pretty great trail magic. A little slice of Nola up in the north woods!  
We got into town and ate some terrible, undercooked fried everything at the general store.  The whole town was booked up because of the rain and we were kinda dreading having to hitch back and stealth camp when word got round that the little red hen was letting people camp out back for free.  They seem like great folks.  Besides the free tenting they gave a bunch a people low on funds free leftovers and even made them some pizza.  Anthony, I think noe OTB, was really nice to grab me a slice when I told him how terrible our dinner was.  We also met ninja something or other who is attempting to break the sobo unassisted time record.  It's craziness, she basically is hiking all day and night and has pulled a 50 mile day before!  I was just thinking how am I even talking and drinking a beer with you right now?  She's trying to start something like walk off the war for vets that I wish I could remember the website to.  It sounded nice so I'll have to post later.","Andover rd 1

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545922,"The mountain reminded me who's in charge today.  We were coming over east peak of baldpate mtn and had just come above the cloud line.  It was really beautiful and had a weird mystic look to everything.  While we were walking down to the little valley between east and west peak though we got hit with some cold and fast moving fog and were in white out conditions.  It was all exposed, wet granite and when we got to this one cairn we couldn't tell where the trail went.  I went down this one slope to look for a blaze and bit it hard after slipping on some black moss or something.  I landed pretty weirdly and hard on my right knee and was thinking the worst.  Thankfully all the moving parts still work and I just got a skinned up knee and what will probably be a pretty nice goose egg in the morning.  I knda braced myself with my hand with the clam can cut and was worried that might've torn open too but I lucked out again with that.  I took it real slow into the shelter after that!  Scored a chocolate chip peanut butter cookie from a father son that came out for the night at least.  
The day started and ended wet.  We got a great breakfast from the little red hen in Andover, plus pie, ice cream, muffins, and coffee.  It was tough to pack up and get moving though having been wet all yesterday and knowing we were gonna be wet again all day.  After hearing the pine Ellis was charging 12 bucks a person for a ride back to trail we went to go stand on the corner and hitch in the rain.  We weren't having much luck and almost went back in for lunch when a nice bear hunter picked us up.  That was an informative ride.  For starters, I'm glad I have my blaze orange bandana and yellow pack cover because this dude baits bears in some spots within a mile of the trail, and apparently it's close enough to hunting season already and you can kill as many bear as you want.  He likes to bait them with marshmallows and then bow hunt them.  And he doesn't like people that hunt them with dogs. On that we agree.  He gives the meat to elderly and charities in the area too, so I don't really have a problem with it I guess.  Just something I couldn't do.","Andover rd 2

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545925,"We just did 1.5 miles in about 3 hours and change.  That section is called the mahoosic arm and after lunch at speck pond we planned to do that, plus the mahoosic notch, plus a couple more miles to the full goose shelter.  But when we rolled up on this campsite and realized it was 7pm, that was that.  We probably went about that same speed coming down to speck pond off of old speck mountain too.  It was just treacherous.  Super foggy and misting on an already damp ground of mostly super steep and very wet granite that alternated between sharp and slippery and just super extra slippery.  The terrain and conditions today were harder than katahdin.  I picked up a few more scrapes and cuts and Kate took a few turtle falls but luckily we're functionally unharmed.  I've got pretty scant rations if we're doing two more full days before town so we're hoping to get up early tomorrow and pull a big day to make up some lost miles.  The prognosticators are saying the sun may finally show its face tomorrow for the first time in a while.  I'm really looking forward to the mahoosic notch first thing tomorrow with a fresh pair of legs.  It's supposed to be the hardest/most fun mile of the AT according to the guidebooks.  Just a giant boulder field scramble that's one big puzzle.  
The day started off with me waking to find my food bag with three freshly gnawed holes in it.  The little bastards ate two big holes in my bowl and stole some of my cheese.  That's the first and last time I'll ever hang my bag at or near a shelter.  Everyone else was doing it and I got lazy  and did too.  Oh well, lesson learned.  
It was a damp but not rainy start hiking and about 3 or 4 miles in we got some awesome trail magic from a beautiful family set up at the grafton park parking lot table.  They made us egg and cheese sandwiches on a toasted bagel, real coffee, ice cold soda water, zucchini bread and brownies.  Omg I love them. Emily and Dave thru hiked sobo  in 02 and then with their two adorable kids and dog nobo a couple years ago, when the kids were 7 and 9.  That's pretty impressive.  They were out there waiting to meet up with her parents who are thru hiking nobo right now, and were going to join them for a week.  So they've got thru hikers from 7 to 70s in the family, plus dogs.  Pretty amazing.  It was funny, as kate and I were wrapping up a nobo showed up and said he'd met her folks last night and had just passed them on the way down.  When the kids heard that they flipped out and started running down the trail with their two dogs while the dude tried to clarify that by ""just passed"" he meant like a mile or two ago, but they were going for it anyway.  We saw them again all together well into our climb out and gushed to the grandparents how much we loved their children.","baldpate lean to

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546933,"Lot of good people at this hut.  Croo, hikers, and guests.  Somehow I was one of the first ones up a little before 5 and I braved the walkway, which was now a river, from the dungeon to the kitchen where two nice ladies were getting started on breakfast.  They put out a coffee pitcher kind of for the guests and kind of for me, and I proceeded to drink the whole thing.  I was chilling at a table, the only one upright among a sea of work for stay nobos who were somehow still sleeping until 630 or so.  We dawdled around while the guests got breakfast and another hiker let me charge my phone on his pack since he was planning to hitch to town tomorrow.  That was pretty great because with the full service I was getting I had blown through like 60% of my remaining battery.  Other nobos were sharing all sorts of goodies too, then the croo let me have a bunch of breakfast leftovers and even more coffee.  We didn't get out of there until close to 10 after all the gluttonous revelry.  I was glad we were descending too and not going up to washington because it was cold, whiteout conditions and the winds were whipping.  Even still, as we went on they didn't get better with the lesser elevation and were probably steady at 40-60 mph all day.  Worse at the peaks and unrelenting until we got closer to treeline about 4 or 5 miles in.  We got to Mizpah hut for lunch and more awesome croo ladies gave us unlimited pancake leftovers with our soup and bread.  We feasted with Another sobo we've been hanging with, tracker/toothless, and a nice college kid hut hopping.  She wants to do the trail and her mom paid for her hut stays as a means to discourage her.  Since she's an actual hut guest, that's obviously not working.  7 or 800 wasted dollars right there.  
I had been saying since the morning that I thought we'd eventually walk down into some views, but the rainy misty total fog was showing no signs of stopping.  As the rest of the lunch table were down on their luck, I was agressively optimistic it'd still happen and renewed my beer bet offer with tracker that we would still walk out of the clouds and get some views.  He took it. And even a couple hours later the wind was no weaker and Kate started to give up hope.  And then glorious victory!  A flash of sun, a flash of valley below.  Then shadows, total clearing and we were eye level with the clouds looking out on beautiful, steep gulleys and mountains for miles.  Just in time for the Webster cliffs which awol mentions as great views.  The only downside was that it was a new kind of treacherous.  Super steep at times with big drop offs and the wind was the most intense we've experienced.  Before starting on the really steep stuff, it plain knocked kate off of her feet with a sudden gust.  Not good when you're scrambling down granite with a cliff on one side.  We took it super slow and ended up not being able to get to the notch where tracker was camped before dark.  At least it wasn't wet rocks somehow, maybe because of the wind?  We stealthed on a pretty steep pitch with some great views while we cooked.  It took us a few tries to find a good spot because there are a lot of big dead trees around, and in wind like this it's best not to hang near them.  It's nice to be stealth camping again.  The huts are nice, but weird.  And there are always loud snorers in groups and you don't really feel free in a hut.  It's good to be back in my hammock.","Lakes of the clouds hut

We went over to the only game in town and hoped if I sat there long enough looking at them through my qiasimodo eye they'd take pity and let me see the doctor.  They did, and a nice British man got my height, weight, pulse and said he thinks it's just a black fly bite whose itchy juices had no where else to go.  Weird since I'd been massacred by black flies previously with no reaction, but I guess nit in my eyelid.  That was great news because with some roids I'd be back to normal in no time, and we can use the hot tub at loon mtn!  The woodstock inn has some deal with them where you get access to their pool and spa, but not very nice to use the tub if I'm spreading ifectioys eye eating bacteria.  And bonus the real grocery store was on the way to pick up my roids so I got some tofu for the trail.  Gotta get that protein, and so delicious in ramen and on bagel cheese sandwiches.  We hung out around town a while t hen got a shuttle up to loon mountain hot tub, which confirmed the assessment of the town as a working class, Jewish vacation spot for mass and ca folk.  Place was crawling with kids but the hottub and setting were great.  We obviously didn't fit in and when word got out we were hiking the trail we suddenly had an audience and were blasted with questions.  They were all good folk and I shared my beer with them, since one beer and a hottub and I'm wasted anyway.  Apparently that's illegal in NH too, beer and pools or hottubs and a staff lady came by to point us to the many signs indicating that, but then she was cool and said Jyst don't make a habit of it and left with a smile.  I think if I hadn't have shared it it would've been confiscated, as is their right by law according to the signs.  But she would've had to clear the whole hottub and had a mini riot on her hands potentially (yanks and Canadian jews are a bit crass with the language ).  Again though, this is NH.  Everyone has a gun, fears the government yet it's illegal to bring beer to a hottub.  Live free or die yall!  C'mon now.  In fact one guy in the tub would not let it go how he ghought we were insane for not carrying at least a .45.  I was like, that's your small gun?  We fret over ounces, so 10 pounds of hardware and bullets not so much.  It was all well and good til the Canadian said thank god no one's talking politics, because yall are crazy americsns, and then started talking politics and the gun lover was more than happy to jump in and say it all goes back to the degradation of the family unit and poor people just don't understand the historical basis of the Constitution etc.  We took our leave at that point.  Got some food at the brewery then hit it.  My eyes looking better already so well hit the road tomorrow morning.","north woodstock

That was a great swimming lake and it was hot enough that we really wanted to, but we got such a late start we had to keep on keeping on if we wanted to get over the kinsman and close to moosilauke.  Met a nice nobo keg legs whose doing this whole stretch sobo and hiked with her off and  on all day.  Also ran into zappy tendrils, formerly beaver, who we hadnt seen since the wilderness like 5 days in.  Keg legs got a kick out of us reuniting because apparently that happens the whole trail long.  The descent off of South kinsman was a bit of a scramble but not too bad.  Tomorrow we're hoping the rain holds off until we're off of moosilauke.  That's our last epic mountain for a little bit I think.  Right  now we're hanging near the peak of mt wolf, which is just a mucky swamp for the  most part.  It was pretty gross mud bogs coming up here and finding just a halfway decent site to hang was kind of a challenge.  There were a bunch of these Indian pipe flowers with no chlorophyll that are somehow still plants at our site.

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548818,"Today felt much better for me due to an early start and taking some pain med for my feet.  It was over 16 miles with the side trails, and even with the slow burn elevation gain close to 5000 ft I felt like I could've done more.  It's nice to have the trail legs back after the string of zeros because the last couple days were similar miles and elevation but I was not a happy camper.  And I don't think the alleve was the biggest help either.  I think just getting up with the sun and taking a few feet massage breaks and I feel so much better.  We got up to try and catch the sunrise from the lookout but unfortunately it was all foggy.  It was still nice to have breakfast up there though.  Not a whole lot of good views today, but there was a pretty boardwalk up to thundering falls.   I had a good swim in kent pond too.  Hadnt done that in a while.  The inn at long trail is a cool spot too and has a goid Irish pub.  Ran into marmalade again with a couple nobos and he bought us a beer.  Long trail ale on the long trail at the inn at long trail.  I was 3 beers in and it was dark and drizzley out so we pansied out and got a room instead of setting up camp across the street.  Wasn't too bad.  70 bucks for the two of us for a private room and bath, breakfast included.  We were def gonna stop in for breakfast anyway which would've been 25 bucks on its own, and the whole inn is full of cool hiking, skiing and historical stuff.","lookout cabin

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548819,"We've got a sweet little campsite at the peak all to ourselves.  I can hear the wind whipping fast below but we're somehow protected from it.  We went up a steep little side trail just past the cooper lodge shelter and made it up just in time to see a great sunset.  The hiking was pretty uneventful except that we're now coincident with vt's long trail, which I think is even older than and an inspiration for the AT.  It's all LT/AT signs until Massachusetts now.  Another bit of history I would've liked to have known sooner, and was of course made plain to nobos in signage and in AWOL , is that the AT and LT were rerouted semi recently and the old trail is now called Sherburne pass.  That was the .5 blue blaze we took downhill to get to the inn at long trail.  I think I might've just taken that historic route all the way, instead of down then back up again to the current trail, then taking a few miles to circle back around to VT 4 and ending up about a half mile from where we started the side trail.  Apparently there's better views on the Sherburne too.  Oh well, we're still purists!  
Another awesome part of today was disc golf.  We got a free ride in the town bus the 2 miles down to base camp outfitters course, after breakfast and dilly dallying around the inn (they had great guitars, piano, and signs saying please ask for the banjo, but when I asked the lady pretended to not know where it was, which I suppose is reasonable since it was 7am)  the bus charges 2 bucks a person so we tried hitching over for like 20 minutes before it got there.  Close to a hundred cars passed and all we got was one honk.  I thought this was a hippie liberal state?!  Makes me nervous about hitching to rutland tomorrow.  The driver ended up not charging us anyway, and the one on the way back just a buck each.  Anyway the course was great and they rent discs too, which I'd never heard of but was very grateful for as I had none and the course was basically empty.  It did cost 10 bucks to play including the discs but I didn't mind.  Met two other sobos from raleigh out there and played a few holes with them before they had to bail to meet a friend.  I was pretty pleased I wasn't much worse than I've always been too.  No birdies, but  I wasted a bunch of birdie opportunities which is my usual style, and I'd like to think a sign that I'm on the verge of greatness.  We finally got to hiking around 2, so we'll have two short days since it's only about 12 in to rutland tomorrow.","inn at long trail

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548821,"We woke up to catch the sunrise near the gondola lodge at the peak.  It was a beaut.  And pretty great with the morning coffee.  On the way back to camp the nice lady from base camp outfitters was up there with her running group and she chatted with us for a bit.  Her and her friends do a lot of intense mountain runs.  That morning they came up all the way from the base to catch the sun as well, which I'm sure is a huffer if you're running the whole way.  
It was mostly descent all day.  We had brunch at the governor clements shelter.  It's pretty overused being close to a road, but had walls of stone and a fireplace, as well as historical tidbits in the log.  It's the second oldest shelter on the LT, built in 1929, and only a couple are older on the AT.   Kate got a head start out of there assuming I'd be faster, but I never caught her during the 7 odd miles to the hitching road.  oh yeah, and we passed the 500 mile mark!  1/4.4thish of the way done.  Theres one in a tree and before that the supposedly current one written out in stones on the ground, both facing towards nobos.  Since all the nobos are late now and theyve got two notices, i gleefully switched the stone one to face the oncoming sobos.  
Hitching was again a bit hard, this time with active aggression, including driving on the shoulder pretending to hit us and flipping us off.  We gave up and starting walking to try and catch a bus when a nice Massachusetts couple with a car filled to the brim with kayak gear passed us 3 times and stopped.  The lady had thru hiked in 03 and they were on their way for the guy to kayak the length of lake Champlain in like 2 days.  I guess they'd seen the trail unexpectedly, turned around to check it out, and then wanted to give us a ride in solidarity even with the whole back seat and hatchback overflowing.  It was so nice.  It took them 10 or 15 minutes to rearrange so kate and I could wedge ourselves in a half seat space on top of each other.  They dropped us off at the infamous yellow deli, a basically free hiker hostel with free Yerba mate and breakfast run by the twelve tribes spiritual community.  It's all WFS or donation.  Part hippie commune part cult that makes their own food, goods, and soap organically.  It was still their sabbath so we were invited to their circle dance and dinner too, but only made the latter.  We went to the brewery down the street instead, hopn moose.  They're a bit odd but very friendly and love hikers.  I suppose because we're wanderers and wonderers and good pickins for new recruits.  They want you to stay as long as you like and visit ALL their communities, on trail and off, and organic farms all over the world.  All the men have beards and tiny pony tails and Hebrew names.  They fed us delicious lentils, then we hit up a another bar downtown (no drinking or smoking at the deli)  and hit the hay.  Unfortunately it was 90 degrees or so in my bunk and I woke up 2 hours later in a sweat.  I went out to sleep on the deck for a little bit until it started raining and then I was up.  All in all I got maybe 3 hours of sleep, whichll make it easy to leave tomorrow at least.","Killington peak

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548822,"Not a zero!  I woke up kind of half asleep from my terrible nights rest around sunrise and tried to get some more rest before breakfast.  The yellow deli folk made us a great breakfast and I met some nice sobos at our table.  Not that I care of course , but it happened to be Sunday and the Bengals were playing their first game of the season.  So we'd planned on doing the chores in the morning, watching the game, then getting back on trail.  Luckily it was on broadcast TV so we could watch it back at the moose brewery with the delicious pizza.  Talked to a lot of really nice folks at the bar and working there and watched the Bengals squeak out a win.  We managed to escape the friendly yellow deli people and actually ship out afterwards.  I was pretty exhausted and full on delicious beer, pizza and nachos so was looking to just plop down anywhere on trail.  Pinky and the brain, a nobo couple, picked us up pretty quickly and gave us a ride back to the 103 trailhead.  They had to go home for a funeral a while back and then to save time and money are doing this really cool way of shuttling/slackpacking with one car to try and get to katahdin before October 15th.  They'd driven back to where they got off, then they pick a section and one person drives the other to one end, then goes to the other end and they hike in opposite directions and exchange the key.  So they can either camp together in the middle for one night or slack pack a day.  And we'll probably see at least one of them tomorrow too since the section we're on is up next.  
Just outside the parking lot is a really cool suspension bridge over Clarendon gorge, with rapids underneath.  I was ready to call it so we just hiked along the river, off trail unfortunately, until we stopped seeing no camping signs and strung up the hammocks.  It's a gorgeous spot right on the river and I'm very thankful it's chilly instead of sweltering in that bunk.  A little rock hop out to the middle there's a great sitting log where we ate snacks and watched ducks and hawks navegate.","rutland

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548825,"Im in my hammock and the moon is shining down directly on me like a spotlight.  This shelter is pretty great.  It's got a sweet view and a picnic table!  I don't think we've had a single meal out on the trail in such a civilized, comfortable  fashion.  I really don't like staying near shelters as exemplified by two nights ago when I hung my food perfectly, and a ways away from the actual shelter, and got a hole chewed through my food bag.  I think it must've been before I hung it actually, as while I was packing up my stuff after dinner with the bags on the ground I saw a mouse scamper away.  So tonight I kept the bags above ground in sight at all times, and hung them right next to my face.  (Bears aren't really an issue out here yet  )  anyways, I digress.  We stayed at this one because it's right at the 20 mile mark for the day and also the last water for a ways, and I'm glad we did.  We didn't really get a sunset per se, but there were layers of pink clouds and fast moving fluffy clouds in front of them.  It was quite a show and all while sitting at the picnic table eating dinner.  Guthook mentioned that there are great sunrises from here so hopefully we'll get a good one during breakfast.  That's a great excuse to get moving too.  We've got about another 14 miles into bennington where we're going to resupply and it'll be nice to get in early afternoon and grab some dinner.  We may or may not meet up with Julie and mark and kiddos (kate's sister and fam) on friday too since they're upstate and headed to boston, but I think either way we'll prob stay somewhere in bennington tomorrow night.  Our goal was to get to Dalton, MA by Sunday, where we sent our bounce box, and with our upped pace that seems pretty doable regardless.  
The big item on the elevation profile today was stratton mountain.  We woke up about 8 miles from the peak and word on the street was a storm was moving in early afternoon.  Word like that travels fast on the trail and people scurry about with wide eyed looks.  Having a statistical background I think helps me remain a bit more calm, since the only certainty is that at any given moment, it's either going to rain or it's not.  So a 70% chance it'll rain in 6 or 7 hours is something I'd be willing to bet against.  It'll almost surely be cloudy and windy, but we've held our plans up before for forecasts like that and wasted whole afternoons.  So it's best to just go.  I mean don't get me wrong.  Even after all that posturing I just spouted, we still hoofed it.  It ended up being a really easy climb and we got up there pretty quick.  The fire tower at the summit is supposed to have some great views but unfortunately it was all misty and foggy when we got up there.  As the story goes, that's the famed spot from which the long trail and appalachian trail were conceived.  
There weren't any signs of the ski resort up there, and Kate and I can't figure out if we've skied there or not.  We definitely skied at a place called stratton but could've sworn it was in NH.  TBD.  That was an impromptu trip when I was visiting her at tufts and I remember learning the hard way that button up jackets don't cut it when skiing.  
The rest of the day was pretty smooth sailing.  We passed by a lot of beaver lakes, beaver dams, beaver bogs, and beaver huts.  I miss those things from maine.  Those beavers sure know how to liven up a landscape.","before William b Douglas shelter

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548829,"This is the first town in vt that matches my idea of vt.  It's a quaint little town with 3 breweries, friendly people, cool scenery, etc.  I woke up around 530 and watched a great sunrise from the picnic table.  It must've been close to in the 30's so some hot coffee was glorious.  I love the pre sunrise colors where it's orange on black still.  The miles were pretty quick and there wasn't much in the way of waypoints.  I found out from a bartender later that it's the longest stretch of uninterrupted trail, I guess including woods and fire roads etc.  There was a cool fire tower about 4 miles in that had great views.  We got some cell service so facetimed with our parents for a bit who are actually together in the smokies.  Kates mom sent us a good pic of her on the appalachian trail.  She's only got like 300 miles to springer!  Forgot how close the smokies are to the end.  I came down a steepish rock hop to the river and hitching road and found dale unsuccessfully trying to hitch into town.  We were both going to the Catamount motel so we called them with the sliver of service and they were nice enough to come shuttle us.  Right after we called too a long trail hiker came out of the woods, also going there.  It was nice to have an instant ride in.  We got a shower and headed to Madison brewery in town.  Really cool spot and talked to a bunch of super friendly people.  Locals, at/LT hikers, bartenders, and a cyclist guy headed to a bluegrass festival in williamstown just down the road.  The trail goes right through the middle of there and a town called north adams.  Kate and I think we stopped in North adams on our way skiing once and remember it being really cool.  The kicker though is that this guy informed me that Williams college is in williamstown, so I actually lived there a couple months one summer abut 12 years ago!  I had it in my mind that Williams was in Williams and so must be somewhere else.  My girlfriend at the time was doing a math undergrad research thing there, and I stayed with her in the dorms.  I had a cushy research job too for this university of Delaware professor studying matrices for the Penn dept. Of infectious diseases.  A bad memory can be a fun thing sometimes.  Makes for good surprises.  Anyway this dude at the bar gave me his number and said we could crash at their place for the festival if we wanted.  That's going to be pretty tempting walking through town I kind of lived in with a loosely bluegrass thing going on.  We shall see, depends when we escape town tomorrow.  
After there we went to resupply and unfortunately the only walkable places were family dollar type stores.  Those places are soul sucking hellholes.  Halfway through shopping we realized were almost out if fuel and there's no place easy to get to to buy it, so we had to RE shop for no cooking, then ran into some hikers and before you know it we've been in there an hour and I'm hating life.  It was freezing out and I was in a t shirt so I was grumping all the way back to the hotel.  Luckily we passed an open door that looked like a cigar lounge and ended up being this really cool brewery called harvest.  Marmalade and horizon passed by right as we were debating going in so we all went in for some delicious beer.  The place was really cool.  Antique furniture, ping pong, wall full of records and the bartender would play anyone we wanted.  It was great to turn my mood back around.","kid gore shelter

We got back on the trail at 2 and a little ways in saw some cool bear prints in the mud.  Looked like a momma and cub and reminded me I need to buy new rope for food hanging and start actually hanging bear proof.  I've heard the bears in Massachusetts can be a nuissance, not just the critters.  
 Kate wasn't doing so hot after a few hours so we got a good stealth site near a brook.  She went straight to bed and will probably feel better tomorrow.  It was nice to make camp early.  I played guitar for a while and wrote a little music, which felt good to get back into.  I'm hoping tomorrow I get to play someone's banjo.  I've been missing that.

Kate was finally mostly ok today, pobrecita.  We braved the humid mosquitoy morning and made good time into dalton.  There were some cool marble cliffs overlooking cheshire on the way.  We spent a solid 3 hours in dalton.  Picked up some goods from our bounce box.  Yay Gatorade powder!  That shit is hard to find.  Walmart carries it but usually only in 10 pound quantities.  My dad sent us an anniversary and me a birthday box combined which got to the PO right as we were leaving, so pretty clutch timing.  Thanks dad!  There were some tasty cakes and candles for me to celebrate, and enough fancy hiker meals I didn't need to resupply hardly anything.  We got a great lunch at Jacob's place and dried out all of our gear on the side of the building.  They were a friendly bunch and the place was full of retirees shooting the breeze.  On the way back to trail kate went in a food mart to resupply and this guy Tom lavardi approached us to say hi.  He's got a place right on the trail and has been welcoming hikers for 30 years.  We'd heard about him from the lady at the pub when we were looking for a hiker box to leave some stuff in, so that was convenient to just hand it to him.  He insisted we stopped by for a Klondike bar on the way out though, so we did and chatted for a bit.  Nice guy.  He gave us the lodown on all our trail friends ahead of us, and the current state of trail affairs in general.  We still had 12 to go on the day though and it was getting close to 3 so we headed out soon.  There was one climb before super flat and I wanted to speed over it.  I was moving pretty quick and about an hour and a half in thought I'd be really close at 4 miles to this view.  The elevation just didn't match up though and I convinced myself I was in bad shape and delirious because that meant I was going under 2 miles an hour.  My feet were sore and my back started hurting when I finally got to a great view.  The sign was for the hill 1.6 past what I thought I was headed towards which made me feel a lot better.  The first view was just nonexistent.  I enjoyed a snickers to celebrate my sanity and could see mt greylock in the distance.  It was a really pretty fall view.  The field of ferns was all red and orange.  Kate caught up a few minutes later and we had a nice break.  We ended up having to twilight and night hike the last 4 miles or so but we made it to our goal for the day.

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549411,"That was a rough end to today's hike.  My feet have been frickin killing me for miles, and it was pitch black by the time we started the steepest and longest climb of the day.  We made it to some good water though and are hanging near the brook.  I just screwed up bigtime.  There was a dead tree near our hammock spot that was already wobbly.  I thought I might as well knock it down now so it doesn't kill us in our sleep.  I knocked it down, but it grazed Kates hammock and tore a hole in her bug netting.  It proved my point I guess, but I probably should've taken her hammock down first.  I patched it up with gorilla tape which has done a good job holding my dry bags together so she should be good, but I still feel terrible and stupid.  
Earlier we crossed the magnificent Massachusetts turnpike after ordering Chinese takeout!  There's this bershire lakeside lodge about .1 off trail that you can get food delivered too.  The lady there was so nice.  I never met her but caller her from beckett mtn and she said you can just walk in and buy soda and eat there if you want.  There are picnic tables right on the lake and I downed about 4 lbs of lo mein and 3 coca cola classics.","past October mountain shelter

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549412,"Man, felt much better today doing those miles.  I did use drugs though along with the frequent foot massages, which helped.  About 6 miles ago my feet and body had basically checked out for the day.  About the same time I ran out of water.  But along came kate with extra water and alleve.  I popped two of those, a caffeine pill, ate like 5 candy bars and applied some of my bikini anti chafing cream and bam!  I was ready to go and feeling great.  Water was a real issue today and thankfully some trail angels left two caches of water at key spots.  We filled up at the Housatonic River to be safe, but then passed a sign saying don't eat the fish because of pcbs.  Then I realized after some research that water filters don't do anything for pcbs.  Or viruses or chemicals in general.  We're gonna start carrying some purifier pills or something too in case were in a bind some time.  The pcb is prob not a big deal since it's much higher concentrations in fish meat, but we also were passing through a lot of farmland and it's likely also full if pesticides.  It's really a shame that's it's pretty much a given that any larger river near civilization is a complete chemical cocktail.  The use of pcbs was banned in the 70s even, along with lead in paint and the creation of the EPA.  It just sits there in the sediment forever along with countless other unregulated chemicals.  Still boggles my mind that so many people would love to get rid of the EPA.  Our air would be like china's and our rivers would be like they were in the 60s: flammable.  Anyways....  Luckily there was still water at the cache and we could dump our pesticide pcb water.  Just like yesterday we saved the biggest and longest climb for the final twilight hours and night hiking.  This one was a steep rocky one too, which my feet actually prefer when they're sore to flatter ground. I guess because of more variable weight distribution.  We caught some cool night views from jug end and mt bushnell.  And this shelter area is sweet!  I can't emphasize enough how much difference a picnic table makes.  And a bear box.  Not having to hang my food in the night is also great.  I haven't actually seen the shelter though, and the bear box says no one else is here.  I thought it'd be packed.  We ran into Marty mcfly today after not seeing him since rangeley and he's been camping with a few other sobos in the area.  I figured they'd all be here but don't mind not worry about waking people up.  We didn't roll in until  830.
  Massachusetts has cool trail.  A lot more hilly, rocky, ledgey, gulleyey etc than I thought.  It does seem to pointlessly meander a bit, but it's well blazed which has been great for our night hiking.  We swear were gonna turn the tables and get started before dawn tomorrow but we'll see.","East brook

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549413,"Water is becoming a bit of an issue.  Luckily the stream in front of the shelter had some pools from a recent run, but was no longer flowing.  We filled up at least but should've cameled up all the way because our lunch time spot at Riga shelter was dry, despite a full drop on awol.   We didn't have to think about in the morning though and climbed 3 mountains, all with good views and some even with steep, scramble sections.  Mt everett, mt race and bear mountain.  Bear mountain had some steeps and was actually the highest point in connecticut.  Oh yeah, we're in CT!  The sages ravine is a really cool cascading creek and ledges area right before that.  Deep swimming holes that we're great for feet soaks and would've been stellar for dips had it been warmer.  At the top of a stone tower on bear mountain was a geocache.  Apparently they're supposed to have something in them but this one just had a book of random acts of kindness people pledged.  The book was full but I'll throw one out there anyway.  
Lunch at Riga shelter was pleasant and featured a picnic table and a view.  But then we went dry for a few miles and only passed I think one other flowing stream before getting back to the Housatonic in falls village.  It was great to meet up with steph and Charles and their family.  Charles was a crazy good cook in college and has only gotten better.  He made us a paella like rice dish with peppers, shrimp and other goodies from the garden.  Crazy good, thanks charles!  Hanging with him, his mom, girlfriend Bethany and steph was a lot of fun.  It's so nice to see old friends out here.","Glen brook shelter

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549896,"Charles made a gourmet breakfast, lunch and dinner.  (We owe you a solid man).  After breakfast we chilled a bit and then....went on a hike!
Our first slack packing of the trail!  This was a planned zero day but the city folk wanted to hike.  We were afraid they might say that   but found a compromise since we could pick up a few extra miles around town.  The trail part we did was basically handicap accessible flats.  The 0.5 side trail we did however, the Mohawk trail, was STEEP.  Maybe as steep as CT has got.  I laughed a few times after the turn off while we scrambled over boulders.  The surprise was fun though and the whole novelty of hiking without a pack made us giddy.  I looked up the side trail we did and it actually extends another 20 miles or so to cornwall bridge, ct and used to be the AT until it was rerouted across the Housatonic in the 70s. After a great lunch steph had to get back to the city unfortunately. (  But maybe see you again soon steph! ) I think after hiking our couple AT miles she's blaze addicted already and will likely quit her job and walk to GA with us.  
After the dinner charles made I had stuffed myself silly and hit a wall.  I crapped out before touching the delicious plum pie tart that Bethany made, so it was serious wall.  All if the food they made centered around stuff from their garden too, and fruit trees.  So so good.","falls village ct

I woke up still stuffed.  I could barely finish the salmon masala cheese egg delight that charles made.  I did however eat half of that plum tart.  We all kind of lounged about all morning then started watching some football.  Charles' mom is into the Giants and we flipped between the games.  I forgot how nice it is to have the recording feature.  They took off back to the city around 2 and were nice enough to let us stay and finish watching the Bengals game.  We headed out around 5 and bushwhacked our way through their backyard toward the river, then down through some corn and hay fields towards where we left off yesterday.  The byshwhacking was a bit thorny but made a 1.5ish road walk into .4 or so.  The stream we had to cross looked like a giant river on satellite, but was just a little creek we rock hopped over today.  Water is still gonna be an issue for a while it looks like.  I brought 4L out tonight for camp and breakfast tomorrow.  Kind of a bummer. 
 I'm about to close my eyes just now when a dog came barking over the ridge sounding pissed.  It wasn't approaching us thank god but I just got up to get our hiking poles at the ready.  That's a new one.  It finally went away and we're back to just the usual woodland critters and geese flying south through the night.  It might frost tonight and those geese know it.","falls village ct

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549898,"Connecticut doesn't have big mountains, but it's sure got some steep rocky climbs.  It was a fun little scramble getting up to these ledges.  My stomach was an issue all day, just not quite right, but we wanted to get this climb out of the way before it rains tonight and everything's covered in wet leaves.  The preceding 5 or 6 miles was an upset stomach's dream: flat, riverside, luxury trail along the housatonic.  When I first got to that stretch by the river, it was beautiful.  I scared off a pair of great blue herons and there was a mama dear and two adolescent dear drinking in the middle of the river.  I got a photo that was grainy enough it looks like loch Ness monster.  When kate caught up we saw a pair of golden eagles and a fisherman.  Everyone fishing in their own way.  The only break in this nature bonanza was a pack of high school crosscountry boys that were a bit of a menace but mostly friendly.  Even in just their short shorts they all smelled like fresh laundry and shampoo.  
The morning part if the hike was a lot of ups and downs with water still an issue.  We've been getting 3L at a time when we need it, which is really annoying.  Pretty much only named brooks have a chance at flowing and even some of them are dry.  All other streams and springs we have to assume are dry.  There's a front moving in tonight that might help, but I think at best it'll get some more running for a day or two before they're dry again.  I hope that state affairs improves soon.  I don't mind walking in the rain for a week.  
I'm hoping my stomach gets better tomorrow because I'm definitely in a calorie hole for the day.  At least it wasn't so bad that it kept me from walking though.  I think it's recovering from the chicken feast charles made us on saturday.  It was so good, but I haven't had straight up meat off the bone in so long I think that might've done it.","past falls village

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549901,"I hate camping close to roads but it was getting dark and we found a good spot near some power lines, which offered a bit more crepuscular light.  It's windy and threatening to rain and I kind of half assed my tarp set up.  I'm too lazy to fix it and am really hoping that pays off.  
 We just passed nuclear lake, full of no camping signs.  With a name like that we of course obliged and wondered if maybe the soil was radioactive.  We've got cell service and so I looked it up.  It was!  United nuclear Corp had a lab there, and named the lake, doing nuclear research for the govt after wwii until a plutonium explosion in 1972.  They did a bunch of remediation and carted away the radioactive soil.  Apparently it's safe now, but why risk it.  
I got off to another slow start.  Still had stomach issues, although it's better.  We crossed into new york officially now.  No more CT.  There was no NY sign unfortunately.  The water was a little better this morning but still pretty dry overall.  We crossed the road into Pawling and were planning on walking .6 to a deli for lunch but luckily there was a food truck right there.  Next to that was a hiker friendly gardening store too that sells fuel, snacks and showers.  It's right on the metro north train line and I had no idea there was an actual appalachian trail stop, literally right on trail.  Those two spots saved us 1.2 miles of blue blazing today so I'm very grateful.","bulls bridge road

The previous part of the hike was really pretty too.  It was up on a Ridgeline with great panoramic views the whole time.  Although the reason for the great views was that it was the Palmerton superfund site.  They did a 100 years of zinc smelting there which they tried to clean up in the 80s.  There were some really young pockets of trees but it's mostly still deforested and all the springs through there have ""high"" metal content.  Before and after the site they have boot scrapers on the trail too.  When we first saw them we were like oh that's prob to prevent tracking a non native species in.  Then we realized oh, more likely to not spread contaminated soil outside the site.  Gross.","wind gap, pa

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550620,"Got another late start due to difficulty getting back to trail and weren't hiking until 10.  The climb out of Lehigh gap wasn't as bad as the numbers suggested.  The spring near the shelter was flowing well but had a strong suggestion saying to treat as well as filter so I just went with the water I had already, being so close to a super fund site and all.  In fact the zinc smelting plant that caused the superfund status on the ridge is still operating in the valley, so I erred on the side of caution.  Luvkily there were some trail angel water drops like before.  
It was a really flat day and we were only slowed up at times by a few larger rock scrambles and climbs.  We met some cool folks counting hawks and other birds at bake oven knob, which is a beautiful outlook.  They put up a giant owl on a stick over the ridge to get some of the other birds to attack it.  I learned what a sharp shinned hawk is and right after they explained that I saw one dive in. And try to slap the fake owl in the face.  They're cute, smaller hawks and if I were them I would not be messing with a great horned owl.  Apparently they hate them though.  I got to see a few others but they fly so high most of them were just specs.","Lehigh river

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550622,"We got an uber back to the trailhead instead of calling the very nice racist man who gave us a hitch yesterday.  Right after starting out and seeing the Schuylkill river (an old friend from Philly btw) the trail walks through port clinton, pa.  We were about to make the turn across the river when a guy starts whistling like crazy at us.  I was super skeptical about chatting with this guy buy he ended up being a lasher, long ass section hiker, and was telling us about the barber shop which had donuts, coffee, and a little jam going on.  Half the town was in there.  I was still in make miles mode since it was already 10, but glad we stopped.  A fella had brought a banjo and he was playing guitar while an older lady sang and yodeled.  Holy shoot could she yodel too.  I played banjo with them for almost an hour.  It was a lot of fun and only the second time I've touched a banjo since we started.  I will soon be famous too as there was a reporter and photographer there from the local paper doing some piece for Schuylkill living or some magazine they put out.  He's gonna email me the article when it comes out.  I'll keep you posted.  
Another hiker in there had a cute little dog named rooster which when he told me the dogs name I remembered seeing a lost dog poster not long ago for that same dog.  Poor guy had spent a day and a half looking for him.  He'd been hiking a lot with the lasher, walrus, and one morning walrus left the shelter early and the dog followed him out, but then got lost I guess trying to get back to the shelter.  Anyway, those two had left the barber shop a bit earlier than us but we caught up to them and hiked and chatted with them for a while.  Think rooster's owner is named ax.  The trail name things funny.  You get used to it but forget it's weird.  When the reporter asked my name for the photo credit I was like, mr. Tuxedo and he was all, uhh...do you have a real name?  
It rained for the first couple hours of the hike then cleared up.  We did pretty good for not actually starting until after 11.  We made our daily goal before dark.  I called amy and we set up a time to meet saturday.  Excited to hike with her and her new dude.","hamburg, pa

Man its still real hot out there and I was dripping sweat most of the day.  There were a couple cool rock mazes and the fall colors were great.  About 11 miles in we took a little side trail to a deli and got some fried food, milkshakes, and resupplied some items to make sure we didn't have to stop before harpers ferry.  Right afterwards we ran into cricket who got a late start too.  He hiked with us til nightfall but wasn't into night hiking.  He'll definitely catch us early tomorrow.  I has vowed to go 25 today to make up for laziness yesterday, then 20 when we didn't leave til 1130, then eventually crapped out at 9pm when we passed a really cool looking hostel called iron masters mansion and I realized that it was another 2 miles to get out of the park and off the road walk.  Kate was pissed.  But now she's eating pizza, watching the debate and drinking Bourbon with two women cursing at trump and she's happier than a pig in shit.  The dude at the inn was nice enough to fire up the oven for us late.  This place looks huge, cool, and old.  I'm eating pizza next to a walk in fireplace right now.","boiling springs, pa

 Finally we crossed into WV and harpers ferry.  Not what we were expecting.  Awol makes it sound like it's a hiker town, but it is packed full of tourists.  Everyone is foreign.  I was glad we got a room at all.  We passed a wax museum on the way to the hostel that depicts all the principals from John browns raid, which went down here.  That was the abolitionist raid on the federal armory in the hopes of inciting a slave uprising.  It was suppressed by none other than robert e lee.  Brown was caught and hanged for treason and the whole ordeal was a catalyst for the civil war.  That was when wv was still va, so I suppose I should say the war of northern aggression.  It's also a really pretty town at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers, so I'm not sure which makes this an international tourist hotspot.  Maybe just the wax museum.  The trail followed the Potomac in, and it's another beautiful mountain river kind of like the susquehanna.   In any case, the townies  weren't sure why so many people were here either.  The whole town had shut down by 6pm except one restaurant, and we were lucky to get some gourmet food and beer right next door.","pine knob shelter

Giant topographical 3d map of the trail laid out in a line.  It's great seeing where we've been and where were going like that.  Maine looks like a mountainous coastal swamp land.  One of the staff guys reminded us that the difference between the mountains coming up and the mountains we've done, is that they have dirt in the south.  Which I knew I guess, but didn't really get excited about it until he said it.  And he also confirmed what I'd been thinking lately that for sobos, PA doesn't seem rocky enough to merit a nickname about it.  For nobos thpugh, it feels like rock immersion plus it's super hot and dry when they come through.  
We weren't sufficiently fed and ready to leave until 4 or so out of town, and another short day tomorrow.  I felt a little guilty about it earlier but now am pretty excited.  There's a PATC/ATC run hostel in 16 miles that's got a sweet deal.  Bunk, pizza, soda, pint of Ben and Jerry's, laundry with loner clothes, and breakfast for 30 bucks.  Judging from the PATC shelters this place is prob nice too.

Most of the day was pretty uneventful, and slow going because of Kates poor toes.  Really hope they break in soon.  That's gotta be so frustrating.  We're both listening to this cute civil war podcast with like 200 episodes.  Inspired by the MD and WV historic sites we passed and the ones coming up.  We passed manassas gap two days ago.  There was harpers ferry and surrounding battles, and now we're in Shenandoah and I think we may get to shiloh soon.  We were looking up some of the first conflicts, especially first manassas, also known as battle of bull run, and the fort Sumner war opener, and what struck me about both of those was that there were enthusiastic spectators!  Charleston SC residents were out having cocktails on their verandas as they watched and cheered as SC bombarded fort sumner.  And at manassas I, northern senators and others came down in droves with their carriages to picnic while watching what they hoped would be a quick rout of the rebels.  Well it ended up being almost a rout of the feds, and the only thing keeping the rebels from decimating the union troops was that the roads were clogged with the picnickers, which allowed for a chaotic scramble back to DC. ","dicks dome shelter

We didn't do much to celebrate Halloween, though it wasn't goose egg.  This morning two ladies dressed as fairies passed us on the trail and we're handing out candy.  And Kate used some leaves, branches and acorn cap to get a deer costume together for a quick pic.  I got nothing.","Big meadows lodge

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551152,"Black Rock mountain had a gorgeous view from a landslide boulder field to end the day. Earlier we had run into another sobo wed met in NH, Nigel Thornberry, and met a flip flopper calamity Jane, now on her sobo flop.  And we were deciding whether to camp with them at Blackrock hut or press on a bit.  I had been hiking with nigel amd jane for the last couple hours and was leaning towards calling it and going to the hut.   When Kate caught up though she wanted to press on.  I checked the weather and it was supposed to be 10 percent followed quickly by 1 percent chance of rain all night.  Right after I switched my phone off though, it started raining!  So we were gonna head to the shelter.  When we got to the turn off though it'd cleared up and Kate's feet were good to go.  I reluctantly went along.  Nigel and Jane seemed like buena gente but I gotta admit I was also tempted by the chance to get in on some beer and food.  See their friend, who I also met and seems cool, is apparently the patron of their group some folks called the vacationers.  I gather he's sort of yellow blazing the trail and treating the rest of his buds to trips, booze, food, etc.  Super generous dude.  He had been slacking them for the day actually, and only met up with us about a mile outside the shelter.  But alas, it'll be good to get into town earlier tomorrow.  The shelter trail would've added 0.4 miles and partying past 8pm would've meant no getting up early.  So we're a couple miles closer and we'll get up a couple hours earlier.  I do hope we run into them again another night.  It'd be fun to have an on trail party.  They were one hut ahead of us last night and apparently had decorated it with lights, balloons, had real costumes and went all out for Halloween.  
The first half of the day we didn't see a soul.  It wasnt until we had lunch at this great babbling mountain brook did calamity jane catch up with us, followed by nigel and some section hikers all at once.  It was a bit of a roller coaster of ups and downs with lots of great views and colors.  There was this really weird peak too.  All the trees were charred and sparse and the underbrush was thickets of purple loose-leaf, I think.  It's got bright purple stalks and purple berries that hang like lanterns.  It had a weird smell to it and the whole scene was kinda willy Wonka.  Oh, and probably the highlight of the whole day was just an hour after I started hiking, I saw the biggest bear I've ever seen in the wild.    I was feeling a little groggy still and this woke me right up.  I heard a snap and then saw this guy sprint away.  Really glad he was scared of me!  It ran away parallel to the trail though so I sang real loud for a while to make sure I didn't startle him again.   
Well, time for sleep.  While the rain passed quickly, a thick fog rolled in right after and we've got a nice, dark, damp, zero headlamp visibility thing going on.  Hoping this all dries up over night.","Hightop hut

Today was our last in the Shenandoah and it was HOT.  Combined with a lot of young forest and fields and my face looks like I spent the day at the beach with no sunscreen.  The last 5 miles were actually the most strenuous of the whole park.  A small parting gift.  There was an actually, albeit short, steep climb followed by rocky slate and technical ground.  Compared to the last few days of dirt cushion, the struggle was real.  I even had to use my hands twice!  How quickly we get spoiled.  While waiting for Kate at the end of the day I like to go to sleep until morning.  
The hiker hostels were all closed for the season so we ended up at a B&B in town.  They had no laundry which was unfortunately a game changer.  I wanted to just skip laundry and go into the cutesy town center to get gourmet food, craft beer, and resupply at the Kroger where we could get graeters ice cream.  After the ensuing domestic squabble though, Kate of course won, and we went to the laundromat and the town's pit of despair.  I was hangry by then and desperately trying to climb out of my grump.  We ended up at a pizza Hut for dinner, and going to the Walmart .  I was feeling very entitled and put upon, but finally broke out of it and enjoyed myself getting drunk in 3 beers, a pint of ice cream watching the world series until like midnight.  Kind of embarrassing for the MLB that they're really trying to cut the game length down but the Marquee event takes 7 hours.  I made it to the bottom of the ninth.  It was entertaining though while I lasted","Past Blackrock hut

And then waffles, a few orange juices, and a cortadito.  The lady working gave us a mistake smoothie too.  It was taking a while to get the ride back to the trail so we decided to check out the cidery a little ways down the road and just hitch back.  Apparently theres a bunch of brewries in the area and mist if the folks at the cidery were doing brewery hopping tours.  Super nice place.  I still can't get into the ciders, no matter how dry and fancy.  But it was a good bit of fun.  The hitch back actually rook a while.  Finally a guy picked us up in his truck with a dashboard full of ammunition and a shiney rifle by his side.  He was wearing camo, in a truck, and it's the south.  So even with one hand on the wheel and one on the shotgun it didn't seem that odd to me.   Tealeaf and buckshot were I think a little weirded out.  I like talking to the local hunters.  It gives you a good sense of how vigilant you should be with the blaze orange.  He seemed excited for bear season next week.

Keys are in that black truck out there, take it wherever ya want.   So that was pretty great.  Little did I know it was a beat up, stick shift, quirky truck.  Even though Kate's the better stick driver, she's too scared to drive other people's cars.  Granted, the last one offered to us was on a hill, owned by a coked out coke head who'd been coking it up talking to himself all night.  But this one was still on me and I was hangry.  So I surprised myself and very smoothly got us to food.  I wasn't sure if 5th gear existed, so the guy riding my ass all the way in to town was gonna have to wait.  We got back early and in bed early.  It was great.","Thunder hill shelter

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551409,"The terrain must've been easier today because we didn't start until late and I had to double check that mileage a couple times.  My pack was dry this morning but still with a heavy eau de dog piss.  Luckily were in town again tomorrow early so I'll have time to do a nice vinegar and baking soda soak down.  To be honest, just like the hiker stench, I got used to it pretty quickly and it wasn't a big deal.  Although it's strong enough that Kaye can smell me coming with the right wind.  Also luckily was the hitch we got this morning was a truck and we got to throw the packs in the back.  Another really nice guy took us out of his way to the trailhead.  He'd been working with the motel owner on their diner renovation.  The owner saw me at the continental breakfast and told me to feel free to borrow his truck again this morning if we needed. If you're ever in Buchanan, wattstull Inn is the place to be.  I think it's the only place actually so you won't miss it.   Everyone's talking bucks.  I think it's the only thing I've overheard in all town conversations.  Deer season is like fresh pow days for these folks.  Hunters and hunting dogs everywhere.  I'm not excited about being out on hunting grounds but  I really got nothing against it,  except near the trail.  I found one bait bag just a few feet from the trail today that I took down.  I don't think you're supposed to bait the deer during season days anyway.  
Today was another beautiful fall day, and a lot warmer than before.  We're a good 1500 feet lower and less wind which helps a ton.  I had a lot of new music to listen to which was great.  Ryan adams and the Cardinals, cold roses.  So so good.  That was my jam year after college and haven't listened to it in almost as long.  And Neil Youngs rust never sleeps.  Some of my favorites.  My my, hey hey, thrasher and powder finger.  Those words to thrasher might be my favorite lyrics ever.  Lastly I had some leonard Cohen.  I'd seen the news he just died and thought I'd get a couple of his too.  
As usual I'm excited about the short mileage tomorrow.  There's a brewery on the way into town too and I think even with a pit stop well get in earliesh to do chores and pig out.","Buchanan va

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551410,"Never took a photo today so here's another from yesterday.
So in addition to the planned short day today we get an unexpected but very welcome donut day tomorrow!  (Thanks again James for the phrase).  This morning I realized it was Saturday and the post office closed at noon, so we have to wait til Monday to get our packages.  Also the outfitters closed Sunday too.  It feels kind of like a snow day.  Last night I got enough sleep but really didn't sleep much.  I watched the sunset, then the moon and constellations move across the sky, then the moon set and the sun rise.  It was a busy night.  All the while I had cell service so looked up all the daleville deets and realized our mistake.  It was a short, pretty hike through ravines and we got to the brewery road by 3 after a really late start,  which was also nice.  Abs as a bonus tealeaf and buckshot were only about 5 miles behind us so met us at the brewery. That was a lot of fun.  They had arepa truck there so I got to dust off my venezuelan and chatted it up with the two dudes.  One of them asked to play my guitar and he was really good, and nice.  He said he actually used to have a full sized cordoba and loved it.  I've only played the mini, but also love it and might be a lifetime brand convert.   He list his in Venezuela when he left it in his friends car which got towed.  Then the usual deal with the towing is they steal everything from the car and you never get that back but if you pay enough you might get the car back.  So that was it for his cordoba, although he now plays a 1960s Gibson dreadnought of some sort that his uncle just gave to him.  So that could be worse.  But man things have gotten so bad in Venezuela.  It's really sad.  I remember chavez' televised rants from 10 years ago and man do they sound a lot like Trump.  Scary.  But now it's even worse.  This guy's friend working the truck with him just got to the US and speaks zero English.  He was assaulted by some gang trying to steal his car and kill him, but fought back ending up slamming the guys hand in the door and hitting it with a hammer to get him to drop the gun.   So he barely escaped with his life but had to leave the country immediately or he'd definitely be killed by the gang.  He left his wife and daughters behind and his church is helping to hide and relocate them while they figure out what to do.  I really want to get back into working with undocumented immigrants and refugees because here's an example of one of those probably ""illegals"" that Trump has vowed to deport.  What I really don't get is that one of the Republican strategies in a lot of states is to eliminate income tax and replace it to some extent with expanded sales taxes, gasoline taxes, services taxes etc.  Aside from that just seeming super unfair to the poor in general, then they also want to do the impossible task of deporting all undocumented immigrants, who make a sizeable chunk of that tax base.  Obviously, I digress.  Later on those Venezuelan dudes provided some fantastic trail magic.  When I went back to the truck for seconds they had a bunch of arepas from an order never picked up, and just gave them to me.  Then gave me his card and said if I need a ride or place to stay or anything once I'm down in springer, his friends in Atlanta would hook it up.  So frickin nice.  Meanwhile we were having a grand ole time with tealeaf and buckshot just chewing the fat and telling trail stories.  They had a doozy from a couple nights ago.  Two hunters had set up their hammocks INSIDE the shelter, overturned the picnic table to serve as some sort of fire backdrop, then took the heated stones from the fire ring and put them all underneath the shelter.  They also made it clear they were super mean and stupid.  Man I'm glad we've had nothing but super nice run ins with hikers and hunters alike.  Ee got some more trail magic from some folks having a birthday party who gave us their leftover cake and then we closed the brewery down at 8pm and luckily got an Uber.  The road walk to the brewery in broad daylight was super scary on its own.   The owners were leaving and let us stay by the fire and let us lock up on our own.  I owe a lot of karma after tonight.  We all went back to our hotel room for a little mini sobo party with beer and ice cream.  We should've got a flying mouse growler but had to settle for yuengling instead.  It was a really great night.  What's gonna be awkward tomorrow though is that by playing it safe and taking the uber, we left about 1.2 miles of trail undone between the brewery and the hotel, and the trail is basically right through the hotel.  So we'll see how purist us and them end up.  I think we're anal enough that we won't skip that section, but maybe just slack it tomorrow so we can just get right on trail Monday and not back track.  Buckshot was sounding like he might even be purer and need to full pack that mile   well see how it shakes out.  The other lazy, dorky, purist issue is do we just walk out and back for a round trip of 2.4? Or cab it and only go the right way","Wilson creek shelter

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551651,"Technically not a donut day.  Today was the historic 2nd slack pack of the trip.  There's a really sweet gas station right on the trail and next to our hotel that we stopped at for some Gatorade.  They smoke meat outside all day long and have a bunch of handwritten signs that advertise all these deals where they throw in a lottery ticket.  Buy two sodas, get a lottery ticket.  Buy BBQ, lottery ticket included! We stopped there on the way to the trail and opted for the out and back trip to get that little section we missed yesterday.  Besides no pack, I didn't even have my poles and it felt so weird.  Afterwards we went to three lil pigs BBQ and that was a great place.  They gave us free delicious hush puppies and had good beer.  Surprisingly the non meat options were pretty good too.  The other things I loved about that place was they were playing good music (I heard Jose Gonzalez, Ryan adams, and bonnie raitt) and every table had pass the pigs.  Kate smoked me.  We hit up the Kroger for resupply and we're both super excited to get graeters ice cream.  For the res×et of the afternoon we just hung out, ate, and watched the steelers lose which is always fun.  The slope turtle really wanted to de-urinate my pack and I'm super grateful.  I think the dog piss smell is gone.  My guitar case is literally a sponge though and I'm thinking I might need to have a blow dryer session with it tomorrow.  That's my only complaint of the cordoba guitar/case is that that thing intensifies the moisture and the guitar usually ends up always having a little wetness somewhere.  Hasn't affected the action at all though.  We're two thirds of the way done and the only thing worse for wear are some rust on the tuners.  Love that thing.  I'm gonna end up writing one of those gushing positive letters to the company, I know it.  With the cold on the way in here I was seriously considering not carrying it anymore. It's tempting when it's getting to be so cold you can't really play it except midday or at hotels.  And not carrying it would be an instant 3 pound drop.   Bit after playing it today I felt ashamed of even thinking that.","Daleville, VA

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551652,"Town chores sucked us in again and we weren't in trail until 130.  This time was a bit more momentous and everything feels very weird, scary, and exciting.  We switched out our sleeping bags and air mattresses for the new under and over quilts that they just mailed us.  So happy birthday to me.  And thanks dad for forwarding.  We also dropped a chunk of change at the outfitters switching to full on winter gear.  I got a down coat upgrade plus an under armor base layer and full on mittens.  I also picked up the extra fleece and new socks from the bounce box.  I'm curious to see what the weight difference is.  The advertised difference for 30 degree quilts for 40 degree bag and mattress should save me a pound.  But old down for new, extra fleece and layer plus old gloves for new all added.  I could also get rid of a shirt now too I realized after the fact.  With luck maybe I stayed even.  Our options for resupply though we're 50 or 90 miles, and we went big with 90, so the pack was super heavy with food.  I'd guess over 40.  Also not helping was I brought two beers out.  A lot of firsts tonight.  I've never done that but we had a whole 6 pack we never touched so it seemed like a waste.  Plus we knew it'd be a short day.  I just had two beers with a fancy mountain house meal (so thats 2 pounds lighter already) and am now laying in the hammock with no pad.  It feels like I'm breaking the law or something.  Aside from the stress of the drastic gear change and running all about Town, it was a good day.  Started off with Bojangles!  I was so excited about that.  Then post office where we had five packages and had to bounce things, send stuff to cincy, and figure out food and gear resupply.  I screwed up and left some things at the hotel too, but at the coffee shop next to the outfitter Kate had met a thru hiker nobo alum from this year with his friend who's doing a sectiony thru.  They are doing a 5 day section together and offered to shuttle me around to hotel and post office to fix my mistake, which was great.  They're basically doing the same stretch as us the next few days so well probably see them again.  I hope so because the friend left her gingerbread and postcard she bought at the outfitters, and the store guy said I could take it since I'll have a shot at returning it to her.  It'd be nice to repay the favor.  It was also sobo thru hiker mini convention at the outfitters.  We briefly met ICE who we've seen in the logs forever, Determined who we've been leapfrogging lately and this guy Okie who I thought I was just meeting but he reminded me we actually met near Lincoln NH just before moosilauke.  That was when that nice old couple was doing their first trail magic and miss Janet showed up.  It's cool to think we met briefly like 1000 miles ago then somehow not again until today.  All those fellas seem like nice folks.  Looking forward to seeing them again and hearing their stories.","Daleville, VA

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551653,"Today was tough one.  That extra pack weight makes itself known.  After the morning we knew there'd be no good water sources for 23 miles so I had over 3L of water on top of the heavy food bags.  I was feeling tuckered by lunch.  A little before we got to mcafees knob, one of the most iconic trail Vistas.  We got the dangling legs photos and even had the place to ourselves for a little while.  From it you could see tinker cliffs across the valley that we'd climbed earlier.  Those were pretty cool in their own right with the trail skirting the edge a good portion.  I really liked this one view from there where you could see this Ridgeline that looked like a serpents tail that undulated off into the horizon.  On the way up to the knob i saw nigel, calamity jane and forprettiest. All headed to four pines which sounds great but was not to be for us sadly. Afterwards there was a few mile trail reroute while the while the ratc cut down some dead trees by the shelter. Kind of a bummer since it put us arlund two shelters we wefe planning on picnic table lunching at. We did see some folks bouldering which was cool. I cant eait to get back into that and actially go outside on rocks. We had lunch at the mcafee parkinh lot and chatted eith a nice dude from ratc who took our trash. We hiked on amd i had just barely convinced kate to go to four pines but we had no signal when ee hoy to the road and awol said .3 while guthook said .8.

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551654,"We made a point of getting up early this morning and did a pretty good job.  It ended up not equating to bigger miles but it was pretty nice having a chunk of daylight left at camp.  We had just barely enough water to make it the 7 miles to the first stream, so there was no coffee.  The trail leading up to dragons tooth was surprisingly hard too so I ended up exhausted from the get go.  It was a decent amount of scrambling over granite and slate rock faces.  The ridge had a lot of great views and I got a few good sunrise shots.   I ran into cupcake and mufasa going the other way slacking back to the four pines hostel so I got to give mufasa her cliff bar and postcard.  The whole rest of the day I was just sluggish and sore.  I never caught up to Kate who'd left lunch before me.  By the time I did I wasn't about doing 22 and she begrudgingly agreed.  It was nice though.  We had some hot toddies and I whopped her in backgammon.  Our packs should be normal post town food weight now so hopefully tomorrow I do a little better.","Near dragons tooth

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551655,"Today felt a lot better since the pack weight is finally normal range.  It was still exhausting but I was in a much better mood and my feet weren't as sore.  We slept in a bit which felt fantastic.   I'm sleeping so nice with the quilts.  I did wake up once last night to see a,cute little racoon couple scurrying about in the moonlight.  We had a bunch of ridgeline views in the morning and then we ran into tealeaf and buckshot under the 2nd biggest oak tree on the trail.  The keffer oak, over 300 years old.  I liked this one better than the biggest because it's not infested with wasps so you could actually hug it.  We had lunch with them and found we've been taking each other's food ideas.  Buckshot was nice enough to give me some mayo for my black bean burger, plus some Irish candy bars that were quite good.  A lion and a drifter I believe.  We all were planning on heading to this shelter which was nice.  I went out ahead trying to beat the last light but didn't quite make it and had to night hike a bit.  The last 6 miles were tough too.  It was a decently steep 1000 up followed by close to 2000 down.  That downhill was rough too.  All loose rocks and invisible rocks covered by slippery leaves.  I even lost the trail for a bit and had to backtrack to find the shelter.  We were all exhausted but had a fun dinner and crashed.  Stars are out again tonight.","Niday shelter

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551656,"I was last to leave the shelter this morning and not having seen anyone leave the correct way, I got lost.  Not terribly, but it took me a few tries to actually find the trail out.  I was having a nice time dilly dallying and wrote the beginnings of a song.  It was one of the few times I've thought of the lyrics first.   Later on in the morning I got lost again bringing up the rear.  I'd caught up to tealeaf and buckshot but then hung back to go check out a view.  The next road I came to I ended up on some fire road for probably a good half a mile before turning back.  Then about 7 miles in once the trail turned rocky I ran out if water, and it was toasty out.  We had a good climb to start off the morning, so I only got just what I needed to make it to one of the many Springs on the ridge.  That was a mistake because all I saw was one muddy spot.  I caught up to tealeaf and buckshot again which helped me not go overboard with the grump, then not long after we caught slope turtle chilling at the shelter.  We all had a lovely dry lunch, but then I booked it out of there to the next spring since I'd been fantasizing about guzzling Gatorade and Ramen.  Thankfully this one was gushing.  Tealeaf had seen mentioned that there was a zip line to some guys house in a few miles, so we met up there a few miles later to check it out.  I had seen that too but totally assumed it was just like a hand rail to ford the creek and then camp on his lawn if you wanted.   Thankfully she read it correctly because it was awesome!  This guy captain installed an actual zip line swing over this big creek onto his yard where he's got trash cans, two really friendly dogs, picnic tables, charging station, and best of all, free pop.  We all had some Dr. Thunders and played with his dogs.  I was then ready to basically call it a day but in hindsight, luckily the rest if the crew wanted to press on.  I'm glad we did because we got the big climb out of the way and now have just 15 or so miles to pearisburg.","War spur shelter

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551657,"The whole team got up early!  It was impressive.  We all struggle with it but done did it.  Coffee before dawn.  It was a little unnerving this morning too because the air had a faint but real smell of smoke.  With extremely dry conditions and much of the southern portion of the trail currently engulfed in flames, the thought crossed my mind we might need to make a run for it.  It subsided though and no sign of fire.  The morning went by quickly and we ended up a bit ahead of tealeaf and buckshot.  We were being followed by a young buck that was way too friendly and is probably dead now.  We had to scare him away a couple times but he kept racing back near us.  All the while with rifle fire in the background.  We caught up to him again later with his two doe harem and had to scare him again.  Then they all ran off in the direction of the gunshots.     we were deer magnets today.  While getting water from a pathetic muddy pool another doe came up and circled us impatiently.  She was thirsty too   and eventually went down a few yards from us to drink while we filtered.   It was threatening rain and the cold winds were picking up on the ridge so we tried to high tail it ourselves to the shelter a mile and a half away for lunch.  We were so close to being lucky, but alas, no luck.  Right when the cold rain hit we hit an open ridge that followed a power line for a while and then an open field.  I was cold from sitting to filter water so just made a run for it to warm up.  The trail was actually really nice dirt and grass so it was pleasant jaunt.  My new osprey pack cover actually keeps the water out too!  Unlike my previous one I've had the whole trip.  I passed slope turtle running and she said I looked like the dude from Braveheart.  So I got that music stuck in my head which was fun.  I got to the shelter just in time for the rain to stop.  It was still nice to get wind shelter though.  Tealeaf and buckshot caught up and we all had lunch with 8 miles down  around 11am.  It was an exciting novelty for us all.  It was super cold and windy after that and we hiked together into town.  Not exactly a great AT snapshot.  We passed a stinky landfill, then a creek of nasty running out of the landfill into the new River, then a super smelly chemical plant also right on the river followed by a giant highway.  Welcome to pearisburg.  This was where cricket was supposed to settle so if you're out there man hit us up!  We never got his real name or contact so if anyone knows it please send.  The people here are super nice.  We went to AYCE Chinese with tealeaf and vuckshor and our friend Jen got to town to visit.  She came bearing cincy beer and homemade cookies (so awesome) and we all hung out in our motel chilling.","Near Dickenson gap

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551947,"Today was the coldest hiking day of the trip.  It was below freezing with winds whipping strong.  Not ideal for Jens gentle introduction to AT hiking, but she was a trooper.  We kind of threw her into the deep end (sorry jen !) and started the day off with a 2000+ foot climb out of pearisburg.  After that huffer though it flattened out and we got some good views at angels rest rock and other cliffs.  We kind of underestimated the whole shebang and realized there was a chance of night hiking too.  In hindsight, we should've been a bit more conservative since the hike was basically a half marathon on a rocky ridge with elevation, plus brutal wind.  The whole slack packing thing really threw us off too.  Breaking with the routine just allows for mayhem.  Kate forgot to get water.  I didn't bring my wind breaker or pack cover.  I was taking a piss at one point.  Leaned my poles on a tree.  Put my snickers on the poles then when leaving grabbed the snickers and left the poles walking merrily down the trail for 20 minutes and attributing any sort of notion something was missing to oh yeah, I'm just slacking.  Took me a good bit to find them too.  Then when it became a possibility there might be night hiking we were short a headlamp.  So I went on ahead to get Jens car and at least shorten the side trail ending.  When I got to the hostel and asked if tealeaf and buckshot wanted to grab their beer out of the car I  found out it was a dry hostel .  So we took all took a ride to the trailhead and had a little dirt road happy hour.  Kate and Jen soon joined us well ahead of any night hiking and we continued the happy hour.  The hostel folks cooked us a banging dinner from their own garden and we talked a lot with  Neville about meditation practices she does and tealeaf does too coincidentally.  Also coincidentally, we're all taking a few day break from the trail tomorrow.  My folks were gonna come down a rent a place for thanksgiving but couldn't really find one.  With Jen going back to cincy tomorrow anywayand my grandma not doing so well, we decided to just go back with her, do thxgiving there and visit my gma.  Also we decided that'd be better and in lieu of coming back for Christmas since by then we'd be farther away and only have a week or so left on the trip anyway.   I hate leaving the trail for this long.  Feels like getting behind but I know that's illusion.

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551948,"""Home for the mf'ng holidays"".  This super nice guy sar-tech we met at Shaws liberally sprinkled his speech with mf-er's and for some reason that one stuck with us.  So here we are.  It was really great to hang with my sister tonight.  You forget how different and great it is being on the trail too until other non hiker trash people see you as different.  Apparently we're different =].  Although not in appearance.  Note to all hiker trash: no need to shave your beard or change clothes.  That's how people look in Cincinnati already.  Blaze orange sock hat over dirty hair, big scraggly beard, hiker wears.  That's the look.  
This morning left me with a decidedly mixed taste about woods hole hostel.  It's supposed to be this hiker oasis and in many ways delivers.  It's a gorgeous, pretty self sufficient log cabin with animals everywhere.  The rooms and food are great too, I just didn't feel welcome.  I think if the bunkhouse had been open it would've been different because inside there's no separation between their house and our hostel.  Michael had seemed nice on our shuttle ride to the trail yesterday, but when I got up first today there was no where I could go where I wasn't in the way with him sprinting and huffing about avoiding eye contact.  He had made coffee, so I grabbed a cup and then got scolded for it.  The bad vibes and tension between him and Neville were palpable, and for him that translated to him just being a dick all over the place.  She was super chill and welcoming but in hindsight threw her shots in too.  At dinner last night they give thanks before eating and you have to say one thing you're grateful for.  She said I'm grateful I know when Michael's lying to me and when it got to him he said I'm grateful that I never lie then stormed off. So yeah, tension.  And in our snapshot it's impossible to judge but hopefully they're going through a temporary rough patch.  One of their goats had some lesions that Kate and Jen were gonna look at for them.  So after breakfast she was like just go get ready while I clean up and then we'll go look at the goat.  Apparently he then flipped out in front of buckshot that we didn't help cleanup.  And this is a breakfast we pay for to by the way, and helped cooked and set up for.  And the zingers kept coming.  He just is clearly in a bad place right now and I hope that subsides for him soon.  In the meantime though, I'd avoid this place unless the bunkhouse is open.  On a positive note, they have an awesome history.  Her grandma ran it as a hostel for hikers since the 40s. And her typeset memoirs are great.  The way she describes hiker culture is exactly the same as now.  And her husband was a grad student studying now non existent elk there.  The locals sometimes saw that as highly unlikely and that he must be a German spy.  Anyway we eventually got out in Jens car and took tealeaf and buckshot with us.  That poor guy has been dealing with tunnel vision for a week and decided he better get his head checked at the clinic before their friend picks them up for thanksgiving.  Really hope that goes well.  Not least for if it does then we'll probably be back on trail around the same time and place and can meet up soon.  I mightve mentioned already we've decided that we are the sobo bubble. ","Woods hole hostel

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551953,"Back in the woods after a long stretch away.  We drove down last night with my sister and the folks at angels rest in pearisburg were super nice.  Super nice.  Especially compared to the dude at woods hole where we'd left off.  And macro man was waiting up for us when we got in.  Hadn't seem him since Hanover.  Pippa from the hostel had texted me few hours earlier to let me know he was there and making a frickin huge dinner too.  (Pippa btw in one of those people you can instantly be friends with and makes you feel right at home.  Highly recommend angels rest hostel if you're in pearisburg.  )   I didn't get it until I got there so we'd already eaten, but we all sat around and had some drinks catching up and eating his delicious guacamole.  This morning we got a great breakfast from friends and family diner which was super cute.  Set up like a cracker barrel.  Then we drove out to meet the shuttle at trents grocery.  Turns out we've been there before!  When driving back from Cincinnati to Raleigh one time we did a random day hike to dismal falls and back and had stopped at trents.  At the time that place had seemed like another world with its dead bear registry, taxodermied everything and grill/supplies, but now it seems so normal.  The w shuttle back was with Pippa and the natural, who wed actually met in Maine and last seen in Andover with his friend hash brown and cute dog, maple bacon pie.  Super nice guy.  He'd been the one who'd convinced Pippa to convert her trailer to a hostel this year.  Apparently he'd also convinced someone else to start a hostel this year too.  Anyway we finally got to the trailhead around 11 and Katie was super excited and nervous.  It was fun having her.  She's the first person to come stay the night on the trail with us.  It was cold but sunny and she got a good sampling of terrain.  Couple cliff views, a little scramble then rhododendron green tunnels on the downhill.  She was worried how she'd do with the pack but did great and we were at the shelter by 3.  We all bundled up and drank pbrs wed packed out while reading the whole log book.  That was fun and slope turtle and I had never really done that before.  Going all the way back for the deep cuts.  Our friend jess and her girlfriend had actually been here two nights before and left us a note which was cool.  We thought we'd run into them but alas they must've been faster than they thought.   A lot of entries referred to this place as the murder shack.  One said wapiti meant murder in Cherokee.  Others mentioned murdered hikers who now haunt the place.  So that's nice.  Wonder what's true. And  We got to chat with an annoyed owl which was fun.  Once we all got settled in for bed around 8pm people started night hiking into the shelter which freaked Katie out.  It's been kinda funny.  There were a couple of those and then anytime Kate or I rolled over or got up to piss she wakes up and asks if it's us.  She's sawing logs right now though so hopefully getting some good sleep.","Angels rest hostel pearisburg va

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551954,"It turned out to be tealeaf and buckshot that hiked in after dark last night.  They hadn't recognized our set up because of the tarps and extra tent for Katie, so tealeaf was pretty surprised to see me at the picnic table in the morning.  We all had a super leisurely breakfast and I was glad Katie got to meet them.  Apparently Katie had woken up with a blood curdling scream last night and saw someone's face in her dream/haunting and I totally slept through it.  It had woken up tealeaf and buckshot across the way even.  We later looked it up by the way and there really was murder at that shelter in 1981.  A guy from pearisburg killed two thru hikers, a couple.  And the description of the face Katie saw matches what the guy victim looked like.  So there's that.  Aside from the haunting we had another lovely day hiking.  We mostly hiked together and macroman caught up to us toward the end to make a nice literal southbound bubble.  We all took side trail to dismal falls and chilled for a while eating lunch at the spot where Kate and I had hiked to on our road trip a while back.  I wanted to hang more with Katie so since we had her car we went into Wytheville and got a hotel.  They even had a hottub and although the water was nasty and smelled like wet dog, the jets were amazing and totally worth it.  We got some balling Chinese food then hit up walmart to resupply.  It was some fun family time.","Wapiti shelter

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551955,"We all hit up the tasty continental breakfast and researched trail murders.  Pretty rare thankfully but man that was weird about wapiti.  Apparently the guy served 15 years for th he double murder them got out!  Later he tried to kill two more fisherman near the trail and they survived the shots and nearly killed him.   He died in prison a few days later.  Despite a lot of bold talk about getting up super early, we weren't headed out to the trail until 10 or so.  Luckily I remembered to check my quilt order, payed the fees then they sent it out while I still had service.  That would've been awful.  We stopped in the bland library to get Internet while Kate snuggled the local cats.  Katie then dropped us off at a cool suspension bridge and headed home.  She camped with us on literally the coldest night of the trip and the most haunted.  That was the only night my water partially froze while serving as a tarp weight.  It was still a lot of fun.  Kate and I didn't see a soul on the rest of the hike.  We had lunch at Jenny knob shelter and had to camel up at some pools since water looks to be scarce the next 15 or 20 miles.  It's supposed to rain a bunch tonight tomorrow morning so we're hunkering down.  Really hope it does too since some of the smokies are now on fire and the whole southern trail desperately needs rain.  There's some Virginia creeper in the photo","Trents grocery

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552299,"Well it finally rained, poured and gusted all night and morning.  Really hoping that helps with the fires and dryness.  The wind was whipping hard too and I got a wee bit of dampness creeping in the hammock but stayed dry myself.  We had breakfast under Kate's tarp which finally kept her dry and decided to nap a bit to wait for the rain to let up.  It ended up working out well and we only had to night hike a couple hours on an easy plateau with just a tiny bit of wet hiking in the morning.  Everything was pretty heavy with water weight but we got some great sunshine to dry everything out in a yard sale for lunch.  We passed a few garbage cans with really cute signs saying please don't leave deer carcasses there since the trash is maintained by a 70 and 78 year old couple.  Who leaves a deer carcass for someone to tske out with the trash?  Later when we got to the shelter tealeaf and buckshot were already there and said there actually was a deer carcass there that we somehow missed.  The hike itself was pretty and sparsely marked.  Never saw anyone else.  The morning when the rain and fog were lifting was especially cool.  One side of the ridgeline was clear and sunny while the other was all cloud and fog burning off through the pines.  A lot of the trail was steep hill hugging descending into rhododendron tunnels.  We got to see a really great sunset too.  It's supposed to rain again tonight and then all day tomorrow so I'm taking advantage of still having an air mattress and sleeping inside the shelter with tealeaf and buckshot","Past VA 611

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552300,"Well it rained all night and thank the lawd.  These fires need gotten out and these springs need run. There was a mystical window of 7am to 10am of no rain that tealeaf was trying to take advantage of so they were up early.  Luckily we all were a bit sluggish because we were still in the shelter at 8 when it opened up.  Not that it mattered much because eventually it would open up several times and it was a solid soaking wet hiking day.  I dawdled behind early to get some alone guitar time and actually had a pretty dry start.  It felt like fern gully with really cool and surprising boulders all in a thick mist with green moss ground cover.   It was a sustained climb so I ended up in shorts and a t-shirt but then a freezing rain and wind came without warning.  I don't think we've seen this kind of dumping since Maine.  When I heard it I went to get my rain jacket out of my pack and in the time it took me to take off my pack cover, open the zipper and put it all on again, I, my pack and guitar were soaked.  It was buckets of rain.  It lightened up a bit later but was a consistent rain the rest of the day.  I caught up to slope turtle right before chestnut knob shelter.  We got there early but it's a 4 walled old fire cabin and once inside and in dry clothes we decided the day was over.  We were planning on going another 10 to the next shelter but once we had the wet clothes off, the wind and rain was outside, and knowing tealeaf and buckshot were planning on staying here too, that wasn't happening.  The cabin had a picnic table inside and we had a good time hanging out not getting wet.  We couldn't see anything with the rain but apparently the view outside is of god's thumbprint and where the Vanderbilt family was originally going to put the Biltmore estate.    The roof was leaking a bit but I found a dry spot to sleep and Kate strung up her hammock from the posts over the table.","Jenkins shelter

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552301,"This morning was rough.  At first it was lovely (and we owe tealeaf and buckshot a solid for giving us water) and we all had hot mochas and coffee for breakfast.  But nothing had dried hardly at all and it was freezing.  I had left my guitar out to dry too and in the cold a string had snapped overnight.  Bummer but I've got a set in the bounce box in Marion at least.  The sun rose which provided a last ditch attempt to get some drying action but really to no avail.  Putting on wet socks in wet shoes and damp pants in the freezing cold was tough.  And the privy was 3 walled with black ice covered stairs which made for some unpleasant and treacherous morning business in the howling wind.  So I started off with zero water and feet that quickly became numb stumps for the first mile.  Luckily by the time we reached the spring about 2 miles in I'd heated up fairly well and was still damp but at least not cold and the body heat was starting to dry things out.  We'd gotten out ahead of tealeaf and buckshot and they never caught up but must've been close all day.  Had lunch at the knot maul branch shelter.  We got to the pre-planned spot that we'd talked about all camping at by a nice brook in this rhododendron cluster.  It was already night and I was ready to call it but slope turtle was really pushing to go further and she convinced me.  We got a nice adrenaline boost too because the hillsides and ridges beyond that were crawling with deer and several times I'd look up or to the side of the trail and see two glowing eyes or more staring back at me in my headlamp light.  In the darkness it's pretty tough to tell bear eyes from deer eyes too but after yelling and screaming at them we caught glimpses of the white tail as they finally scampered away.  We made it to the Davis path campsite which used to be a shelter and has a picnic table, privy, and stairs leading to nowhere.  You can see what happened since there's a giant tree remains where the shelter used to be.  It's funny too because initially I wasn't convinced by the amenities to push on to here, but had it been an all out shelter I think I would've been.  But even with shelters all I'd be excited about are the table and privy anyway.  I guess the logbook and option of sleeping in them or getting out of the rain is nice too.  Anyway I'm glad that slope turtle convinced me to push on because now we've only got a few miles to atkins and can get breakfast pretty soon after waking up and then get to marion at a decent hour too.  It's also freezing cold again and some hot diner food sounds fantastic right now","Chestnut knob shelter

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552302,"We woke up to frozen ground and dew and I was loving the thought of a quick hike to the barn in atkins for brunch.   When we got to the road walk we stumbled over a giant fancy purple dildo.   How that ends up on the side of the road leads to some interesting musings.  The barn was a wonderful diner and tealeaf and buckshot showed up not long after wed ordered.  It was so cheap and we all got peach cobbler with ice cream for breakfast dessert.  We passed an alpaca farm right out of town and I took advantage of the new phone juice from the diner and listened to music the whole way.  There was a settlers museum that was closed but an old school house they keep open.  We just barely made it to the Mt rogers visitors center, where the road to marion is, before dark.  We were having no luck getting a hitch and had zero signal so we were also getting worried.  I saw someone cleaning in the visitors center so went over and she told me there was actually a free phone around back with taxi numbers listed so I called a cab.  That ended up being a mistake because the lady said the cab would only be a few minutes and when I went back to the road, where we were freezing our burrs off, this hunter came back to his car and offered us a ride.  We declined which was a big mistake because the cab took another half hour or so and cost 16 bucks.  Oh well.  We had him drop us off at yummy yummy, a Japanese restaurant.  Tealeaf and buckshot had gotten an easy hitch and had been at the bar down the street for a while.  We joined them after and closed the place down.  It was a lot of fun and man were there some characters in there.  For starters was Pedro, a 300 lb local Mexican who was piss drunk and kept wanting to touch and sniff tealeaf.  And insisted that I should sniff her too.  We were clearly the only non locals and getting out of there without too much of a skirmish was probably lucky.  The hotel was a good mile and half away but the guy that'd given them a hitch had insisted that whenever they were done to please call him and he'd take them to the hotel.  He insisted it wouldn't put him out, he was super bored and wanted to help.  So at midnight they did, and he gave us all a ride over.  He was a very nice dude.  Skinny with a huge curly mustache and camo jacket and just seemed sincerely like a nice guy.  For some reason even though it was midnight when we got back to the hotel I watched the entire viggo mortenson Russian mob movie in Spanish until 3, then fell asleep.","Davis path campsite

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552303,"We got up a bit hungover and Kate was hungover enough to suggest a zero and I was not opposed.  We got a cab to Hardee's for breakfast then walked to the post office.  They had my quilts and the classical guitar book I'd ordered, but not the bounce box.  Before Thanksgiving I'd called pearisburg PO to have them forward to here, but when I checked the tracking it had somehow been all over the place and ended up in narrows, va, just outside of pearisburg.  They did indeed have it and forwarded it to damascus.  Also on the tracking history it had gone to Roanoke, then Charleston wv, then Richmond, then pearisburg again, then narrows.  Go figure.  We walked back to main street and on the way passed this tiny little storefront just jam packed with reptiles.  The  blue iguana.  It was really cool and had a lot of exotic species.  The dudes pet tortoise, some west African species the size of a dog was roaming around and scared Kate half to death when she almost tripped on it and it moved.  Then there was luther, a free roaming lizard the size of a cat who loved to be pet.  When I pet his belly he'd cock his head back and close his eyes in ecstasy.  They had snakes, albino frogs, chameleons, horny dragons you name it.  And scrambling mice and rats.  One lady in there had something crawling up her sleeve, and I'm like, is there a mouse up your arm? And she's like yeah, but it's a rat.  I just bought him to feed my snake but he's too cute and friendly so now he's my pet too and his name is peppermint.  That place was so random and fantastic.  When we left though I realized I'd forgotten to bring my sleeping bag to mail off and the post office was closing in minutes.  Tomorrow is Sunday so I'd have to carry it.  Huge mistake.  No ups or fedex either.  They did have a music shop so I got strings for my guitar and played banjo for a while.  So rusty but it was great to play.   We looked up the bus which was coming in an hour or so and went into the wooden pickle to wait.  We ended up staying longer and got a cab back to the Walmart to resupply.  Tealeaf and buckshot were there and we got to split some stuff.  They were more hardcore than us and on their way back to the trail.  We went back to the room, did laundry, and veged out ordering pizza later on.  I did a lazy restringing of the guitar and just replaced the broken one to play the xmas tunes.","Marion va

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552308,"We were totally ready to pass this one by and head for the next shelter 4 miles away, but right when we got to the turn off my stomach was feeling weird and it was drizzling so we stopped.  At lunch at the last shelter I had some serious hip muscle flare up too and I could barely sit down at the table.  Luckily a couple alleves made that a non issue for the afternoon hike but I'm a bit worried about that for tomorrow.  I'm currently in the shelter with snacks and dice, and unfortunately snacks is brown blazing back to marion tomorrow.  We just met dice a few days ago and Kate has met snacks before but this was the first meeting for me.  I've seen her in the logs and she always puts what food she's dreaming about which I assume is how she got her name.  This is the first night back out with the newly restuffed quilts and I'm in the shelter because it's supposed to rain all night and morning.  We had a nice cloudy hike today with no rain.  The highlight was a good size waterfall, comers creek falls and the Mt rogers visitor center which was open when we started today.  The lady there gave me a cup of coffee and we got to see a hellbender, this giant salamander that lives around here.  Tealeaf had been hearing and drawing about this in the logs.  They had one in an aquarium and while not big enough to ride, it was about a foot long.","Marion va

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552309,"Holy shit.  I think the hike into here takes the cake for the most scared I've been this whole trip.  It had been raining and misting all day and after lunch at the wise shelter we decided to just go another 5.2 to this one and call it a day.  We had 2 or 3 hours left of daylight and figured we'd get in just before dark.  Started off fine even though  it was still raining.  We saw some of the Grayson Highlands ponies and we're trudging along.  No views with the rain but it was really pretty.  Then it got rocky and slippery.   The trail was pretty much a flowing stream and before we knew it it was almost dark and we were still almost 2 miles away from the shelter.  This was all above 5000 feet at this point.  The rain and fog picked up and now we were soaked and could only see about 3 feet in front of us.  This was no big deal on the rocky passes or forest, but then we hit open balds with 30 or 40 mph winds.  We were in real danger of losing the trail now and had to go super slow and blaze to blaze to make sure we didn't.  At one point we came across another crew of ponies just standing there in the dark, rain, and fog. Their glowing eyes in the mist nearly made me soil myself.  The four ponies of the apocalypse.  I thought judgement was nigh.  I was already in adrenaline,  survival mode.   Thankfully we dipped back down into a forest after what seemed like eternity and at least if we got lost from then on we could back track to there and set up camp out of the wind.  When we finally caught sight of the shelter it was the best feeling ever.  We got into dry clothes, made hot toddies with what little water we had left and nipped on the fancy scotch I'd bought in Marion.  We're both out of water but there was no way we were going the 10 feet outside or whatever it was to get more.  We had a dry dinner with whiskey and it just feels good to not be dying of exposure right now.","Hurricane mountain shelter

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552685,"Today was a really tough start.  I was pretty warm in my hammock considering it was 10 degrees outside, but when I checked my phone I got the message my grandma had passed away.  At first I was relieved because she'd been in pain and on the decline for months.  But when I started hiking it hit me hard.  I was glad to be hiking.  I think it's as good a way to grieve as there is.  And it was so painfully cold this morning that I couldn't really process it until I was full stride and on my own.  Not being able to feel your toes is a good distraction.  It never got above freezing today and that's presented a whole new set of uncharted hiking territory.  I can't use the bladder hose because even if I tuck it in my shirt the part by my neck freezes.  The bladder itself is OK thankfully since it's rufht on my back.  To drink on the go I used my fleece and waste strap like a kangaroo pouch and put my water bottle wrapped in a wool sock down my shirt with my water filter.   I like that better anyway because any weight off the back feels like you're not carrying it at all.  We caught up with tealeaf and buckshot for lunch at the next shelter and these hunting dogs were howling up a storm on the way in.  I was scared at first because I could hear one of them closing in on me but when it got close just wagged it's tail, said hi and sprinted back to its friend when he howled back.  All 4 of them came to visit hoping to get some scraps or steal our food outright.  They were all nice hounds with a bunch of radio collars on.  Hunting dogs with no master in sight.   One of them came back by itself and had a really bad gash on its butt.  We called the number on the collar and it followed us like 2 steps behind all the way to the next road.  We got ahold of the owner and he said he'd been out bear hunting.  That just seems terrible.  Dogs getting mauled, bears getting mauled then once they tree it the hunter comes and shoots it.  Most people don't eat bear meat either.  I was kind of disgusted by it but the owner seemed nice and concerned for the dog, sure this happens often, and thanked us for bringing her back.  It was all I could do to keep Kate from stealing the dog.","Abingdon gap shelter

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552686,"What a difference 10 degrees makes.  It was probably a little under 20 this morning and never got above freezing all day, but 20 felt downright cozy after yesterday.  There were good views of Watauga lake from the ridgeline for most of the hike.  We had lunch at Vandeventer shelter which I remembered from the section hike with Ryan. It's got good views from a little rock outcropping out back.  It didn't occur to me during that hike, but the shelters in Tennessee don't have privies and a lot don't have picnic tables either.  Most just have a shovel as a courtesy shithole digger.  That's kind of annoying but I must say it's extremely satisfying digging with a real shovel after using my trekking pole the whole trip.  We got to Watauga dam which is really beautiful.  These huge exposed mountain sides jut out of the lake and you can see every layer of rock.  There was some confusion on where the Riggs were picking us up so that took a whole to sort out and we ended up backtracking a bit to meet them.  They'd agreed to take the 4 of us in for the night and were excited to see Kate.  They were some of her favorite clients too.  I'd only met them once before but they're really nice ladies.  And they took us all the way back to boone.  They have 5 dobermans and 2 birds so there were plenty of animals to play with.  The birds are so funny too.  We had a late dinner and some beers and it was great to be in a nice inside bed for the night.","Iron Mountain shelter

Most of them no.  The general store was closed, no where we could walk to, no one delivered food, no taxis, they wouldn't take us anywhere, no breakfast in the morning, the WiFi didn't work, etc.  I'm paying him 50 bucks for a shuttle to a rent a car place tomorrow morning and when he said no breakfast I was like we'll can we drive through somewhere and I got a "" I guess so"".  I asked if they had any food I could buy and he said no.  Luckily his wife walked in and offered some frozen pizzas for 7 bucks.  At least it was something.  The hostel itself is nice and we actually ended up with a full house.  Beside Kate, me and tealeaf and buckshot, horizon showed up and so did two other sobos wed never met before.  Tonic and I can't remember the girls name.  We all had some fun commiserating about the upcoming sub zero polar vortex coming and lack of amenities here.  The terrain coming up is supposedly a bit hairy, up at 5 and 6000 so most are gonna wait it out or slack a small section.","Moreland gap shelter

The guy manning it was really nice though. He talked of a dinner shuttle and where to find beer and walmart etc. When the time came though about an hour later they didn't feel like doing the shuttle anymore. He also spoke of a space heater and Netflix and vhs player with tapes. Also all no shows. It was nice enough though. They did have bikes you could use so I went to the gas station for beer and snacks while Kate ordered delivery. When I got there I realized I'd actually stayed at the hotel next door with Kelly and her friends when we went skiing at wolf mountain last year. That was kind of weird riding in and suddenly knowing where I was going.

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552710,"Man today we woke up in the rain, it rained all day, and it's still a misty rain right now.  But merry christmas!  We stayed in bed until about 8.  It's so hard to get out of the warm dry hammock and into the wet windy outside.  And even harder to break camp and get going.  The spring was flowing near camp but super slow.  So we weren't actually hiking until 11.  We had big dreams of a Christmas cocktail in hot springs tomorrow but I think those have been dashed.  We would've needed to push another 6 miles today, hiking til 10 or so and then pull 27 tomorrow.  It wasnt complete fantasy but the fog and mist never let up so once it was dark and foggy and I couldn't see 2 feet in front of my face I started having flashbacks to Grayson highlands and was done.  I don't know what got into Kate.  About an hour before dark our plan was to go to this shelter, then 4 miles away, and reassess the visibility to decide on following through with the hike.  She was leaning towards stopping already being wet and unhappy.  That was all well and good with me.  Then a mile in there ate signs for a new hostel basically right on trail.  So I start thinking, well if we end up just going to this shelter, that guarantees another day to get to hot springs, so what's 3 miles?  We might as well go get the pizza and ice cream inside.  When I catch up to her to float this thought, she's decided she wants to go another 16 miles, i.e. 8 more hours of night rain hiking through several rocky ridges and balds.  As she had clearly lost her mind I huffed off saying wed meet at the shelter and reassess.  On the way darkness sets in, the fog gets worse and it starts raining harder.  I'm a little pissed at having been so right but decide to zen it out, it being christmas and all.  When I get to the shelter there's a dude just standing in the dark watching me approach.  Kind of freaky but he seemed nice enough.  He's actually a nobo, and when I think about it, why not?  He goes through the same winter as we do and it's spring by the time he's north.  Might work.  I tell him about my predicament with possibly having to hike until the am, plus my concern that someone is living at the next shelter (tealeaf had relayed this intel)  turns out it was him!  He's got a big Ole tarp that he strings up and must've took over the last one.  Anyway Kate arrives and STILL wants to push on over the rocky balds on zero visibility.  I wasn't having it and I think she was just bluffing to make me be the pansy.  And fine.  I'll be the pansy.  I'm a smart pansy.  We had even read how there's a two mile, strenuous, rocky section that's exposed on a ridge and treacherous if slippery.  Anyway, I sound more bitter than I actually am.  We had some nice hot toddies and Mr. C's christmas candy.  It might be the worst christmas eve I've ever had in my life, but there were a few moments I enjoyed myself!  Of note were several visits by woodland creatures.  This morning while filling up my platypus, a beautiful salamander walked right onto it.  It's just a tiny pool under the spring and that's where he lives.  Later a possum stared me down in the middle of the trail.  I thought it must be rabid to be out at daytime and not running, but I clanked my poles and he ran off.  Well, slowly waddled off.  I guess they can't move fast as I was gaining on him with a brisk walk.  Then just outside this shelter a bunny came up to me and said hi.  I yelled merry Christmas and she ran for her life.","Low gap

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553071,"Well that was it for the smokies.  Thankfully we had a pretty clear day and got one final spectacular view at the Shuckstack tower.  That was pretty great.  It's this old rickety fire tower and I had the bright idea of taking my whole pack up to have lunch up there.  To its credit, most of the windows were intact which blocked the wind.  The downside was the floor wood was rotting, and there was broken glass and animal shit everywhere.  Not ideal lunching conditions.  And what animal climbed all the way up to the top to drop a deuce I have no idea.  Instead of lunch we had a brief safety meeting and  took in the view.  When it was my turn to climb down, lowering the pack down through the first stairs felt pretty similar to how it feels getting cliffed out while skiing.  Just this sinking feeling that man, it was pretty stupid to be in this position.  I just went super slow and deliberate and it was fine, with a small dose of adrenaline.  We had a lovely hot lunch at the bottom and carried on.  The dam was cool as always and I read all the informational plaques waiting on the crew.  I started reminding everyone who'd listen that my great grandpa built it, basically by himself.  Wish I got more details from my grandma too about living here as a little girl.  We stayed at fontana village whuch was not at all what I'd expected from her stories.  I talked to a bunch of folks that worked there about her and apparently she was a ""dam kid"".  They've got really cool historical photos all over the lodge and a couple group photos of kids in school.  She may even be one of them.  Pretty cool.  The lady at the desk let me see this book of memories they'd made of people who moved here like grandma did to build it with the TVA.  Woulda been sweet to get her memories in here.  It's a cool story too.  It's the biggest dam east of the Mississippi and was built in only 2 years from 42 to 44.  They needed massive amounts of electricity for the nuclear hoopla go I ng on at oak Ridge, so this was the answer.  Steel was in scarce supply during the war so it was apparently built with innovative use of concrete to make it strong enough.   It went from a backwater town with dirt roads to a thriving worker village overnight, turned vacation village mecca in the 50s and 60s.  For us though, it was a ghost town that luckily had a restaurant open for 3 hours, a laundromat, and a gas station that sells beer.  It's a dry County, apparently the only one in NC, but if you're a ""resort"" defined by having a tennis court and a pool or some such nonsense then you can sell beer.  We barely made it to the pit stop before they closed.  Super nice folks.  Then laundry ended up being fun.  We had the tiny little room to ourselves and we made it our personal bar with heat.","Mollies ridge shelter

Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553074,"Today was our first real snow day.  There was a solid 4 inch cover with drifts up to a foot in the gaps.  And it was cold.  Mustard seeds truck was reading 10 degrees where he dropped us off and that was the lowest elevation of the day.  I'd guess it was below zero with the wind chill.  Not sweating was not an option so my plan was just to take zero breaks and hope for the best at the NOC.  I was pretty comfortable everywhere except my right foot.  All I have are my trail runners, two pairs of wool socks wrapped in a hefty bag.  Normally that's fine in the cold once I get moving but for some reason my right toes were not OK.  Luckily I had some hand warmers that I gorilla taped to the bottom of my socks and that solved the problem.  They were a little bulky to walk on but the toes got nice and toasty in about a half hour.  Kate on the other hand was rocking it with the snow preparedness.  All her heavy gear payed off big time.  She's got the ""wateeproof"" boots, knee length gaiters and the badass micro spikes.  She left us in the dust at the morning climb.  I had my yak traks which I really like if only they wouldn't disintegrate.  By 5 miles in the functional one had caught up with the crappy one and both were basically on top of my shoe.  I think I can MacGyver them with some string ties underneath but that's pretty egregious it took two days of use to render them totally worthless.  Aside from that and the occasional slip, the hike and day were totally gorgeous.  It was a bluebird day and the snow above 4000 feet was dry fluffy pow pow.  Really wish I had some skis at that point because that would've been amazing.  It felt like skiing on the downhills anyway.  I even threw in a few jump turns to avoid some slips.  At one point my friend Kelly was gonna meet us at the NOC before the weather turned her around and I joked with buckshot, we'll half joked, that with all this pow she might end up taking us straight to the NC terrible ski areas.  He's never skied and wasn't about to try and I was like we'll if youre having fun today is basically a half marathon of the non-fun part of skiing with none of the fun part at the end.  I did actually have fun today eventually though.  Just in case my toes started freezing again u thought it'd be smart to just hoof it on ahead to the NOC.  once I got out ahead it was just glimmering, virgin pow with occasional animal tracks and gorgeous snowy views all around.  I've done this section several times too and it was cool to recognize spots in their snowy versions.  I got to the NOC around 4 and as I'd feared the restaurant had closed for weather and it was a ghost town.   I found a shuttle nu.ver on the message board and the dude was gonna charge me 100 bucks to go into bryson city.  I saw a couple cars roll up and luckily they worked there.  This dude was really excited there were still crazy sobos about and gave me a list of shuttles plus his nu.ber in case they didn't work out.  They had been fly fishing whuch im guessing is even colder than mountain hiking.  We'll 13 freezing phone calls later all I'd found was a 75 dollar shuttle.  Then as I was resigning to defeat another guy that worked at the restaurant showed up out of snowed in boredom and I joked I'd give him 50 bucks for a beer.  Kate showed up then and he let us in and gave us a craft beer of our choosing.  That was some fantastic magic.  I'd been running around trying to work out a shuttle and hadn't changed out if my wet layers.  Being inside in the heat with a bells two hearted was flicking fantastic.  Then for the icing he said he'd give us a ride into town for free, and that was before teashot had showed up.  They dud about a half hour later and we celebrated with mcdonalds at the nantahala brewing Co, thankfully still open.  It's supposed to be in the negative teens tomorrow then warm up so we decided not to risk it and just zero.  Sleeping in!","Robbinsville, nc

",Springer mountain,"Jan 19, Thu",7.40
Mr. Tuxedo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553747,"Im currently driving across the country to a new life in California, missing the trail terribly.  I got a lot of really nice comments from folks who'd been following our hike to help plan their own.  I did the same thing when prepping for mine, and I realized in terms of listing gear and general advice I did an inferior job of it compared to my favoritw/most helpful journal I found.  So if you haven't already, check out this guy Reese journal who hiked sobo in 2012 and left early August.  He took like 4 total zeros and had higher average mileage so finished in around 4 months, compared to our 6.  He also has detailed spreadsheets of gear and tech specs of everything.  I never did that except maybe in passing, so for this last entry I'll try to list the major gear and advice.  The big 3 are your pack, shelter, and sleeping bag/pad.  My pack was a Deuter 65+10L.  My shelter was a Hennessy ultralight hammock.  And my sleeps was initially a Nemo 40 degree spoon shape bag, with a neoair xtherm airmattress, which later on I switched out for an enlightened equipment 20 degree over quilt and underquilt.  I also hung on to my air mattress even though it was redundant with the quilts so I could sleep in shelters when I felt like it.  I highly recommend all of that gear except the Deuter pack.  It's around 4 lbs and if I had started fresh I would've got an ULA brand with around the same volume and weight max.  That would've saved a pound or two.  I never disliked my pack enough to just ditch it and buy an ULA though.  The thing about packs is you should get one as light as possible, but only as much as your load allows.  You can get an ultralight pack only if your base weight is ultralight.  I was far from ultralight, especially with the 3 lb guitar.  Speaking of which, I can't recommend the Cordoba mini nylon string guitar enough.  It's still in great shape after the trail.  Those Martin and other broomstick shaped travel guitars are twice as heavy and sound like crap.  Those were my big items for base weight.  Next most important gear item are hiking poles.  Black diamond seemed to be the consensus best.  They don't guarantee them, but often times they replaced for free if you tell them you're a thru hiker.  For water, we had a sawyer squeeze with a 2.5L platypus bag.  The sawyer squeeze filter is great, but their squeeze bags are terrible.  Platypus seemed to be what everyone ended up with.  Only issue with the water filter is it can't freeze or the filter won't work.  We were able to forestall the freezing by keeping it in a breast pocket while hiking and sleeping with it at night, but eventually we screwed up and had to ditch them for aquamira drops.  I really liked having a camelbak thing, the Deuter pack came with it, for drinking while hiking.  Lot of hikers go with just water bottles, but with the amount I sweat being able to continuously drink was huge.  Once it got really cold the hose froze, but I'd just fill my water bottle and keep that down the front of my shirt.  Now for the odds and ends.  I had 5 dry bags, a mix of sea to summit and outdoor research.   I had two food bags, one for clothes and one for my sleeping bag/ quilts.  And one small one for electronics, paper, wallet etc.   In general, for all gear from expensive to cheap, get a name brand!  Every time I got off brand anything I regretted it.  From batteries to dry bags to plastic bags (btw nothing comes close to Hefty plastic bags, not zip lock, not glad etc).  Anything that absolutely has to stay dry though, it's gotta be in a dry bag.  The hefty or garbage bag liner are fine for short term, like TP or maps, but if it keeps raining, that'll get wet.   Now for food I started with a spork/knife thing, which was pretty useless and quickly broke.  I highly recommend an extendable spoon, and that's it.  Nothing we ended up eating needed a fork or knife.  And a common thing to do was to buy a fancy freeze dried hiker meal, one that you add boiling water to and it cooks in the bag.  Then use that to cook the ramen or knorrs side.  That's where the extendable spoon came in handy. For cooking I had a Jet boil stove and canister fuel. In warm weather all fuel canisters were the same. In cold though, MSR brand was clearly the best. A water bottle that can withstand boiling water was also essential for coffee, tea etc, as well as gatorade mix, drinking civilized, and occasional scooping for poor water sources. I had a I had a Leatherman mult-tool with a knife, little scissors, pliers etc. An emergency blanket I never used. Other essentials I kept in my top lid were sunglasses, gorilla tape, bear bag rope, and in my dry bag: headlamp, gauze, auxiliary charger for cell phone, cushion tape, anti chafing cream, lighter. Lastly for clothing my bandana and paktowel were ways handy. Clothes I specifically recommend are Patagonia Capilene material, super quick drying, and darn tough socks which have a lifetime replacement guarantee which they'll do by mail or you can find a store that switches them directly. I had an extra pair of underwear and an extra pair of socks, but other than that I'd say don't bring extra anything. For footwear I had crocs for campshoes and fording and Vasque trail runners for hiking. Loved the Vasques. Seemed to last hundreds of miles longer than others. Remember to get at least a half size bigger than your normal size otherwise you'll get crazy blisters and your toenails will fall off. I got a full size bigger than normal and wore two pairs of socks and never got a single blister. Also remember don't bring anything cotton, only wool or synthetic. Cotton never dries and looses insulating properties when wet. Well, think that's it. Have fun! Oh yeah, and if it's feasible for you, switch to Verizon.
