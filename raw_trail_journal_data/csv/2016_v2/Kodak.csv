Kodak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521643,"Hello!My name is Ryan Brown, but I've been called ""The Wanderer"" by my closest friends since high school. Even then I had a tendency to wander, though I doubt my friends could have imagined I would become the gypsy I am today. At the time, I was an extremely shy youth afraid of the world. Anxiety and depression controlled my life and kept me from accomplishing my dreams. Then, one day I decided not be afraid anymore. I began facing every fear I had leaving no shadow in darkness. Adventuring became a natural extension of this fear-facing desire so when I left home for the first time on my first big adventure -- a weeklong 300 mile bike tour on the Great Allegheny Passage in 2012 -- I was instantly addicted. The people I met on that journey inspired me to quit my job and spend the next two months cycling to Bar Harbor, Maine. I had less than $100 in my pocket.I hate to use the phrase ""changed my life,"" but the Maine Lobster Mission (when people asked why I was riding a bicycle to Maine I would answer, ""For a lobster of course!!!) really did change my life. I returned with an inner confidence I had never before known. I also had a better understanding of who I am in a world that wasn't so big and scary anymore.The Maine Lobster Mission only fueled my desire to travel. And to travel further for longer. In 2013, I managed to cycle to Chicago while saving money for a trip from the Canada border to Panama. That journey began in 2014 but not before: a 70 mile thru-hike of the Laurel Highlands Trail; a bike tour with my younger brother along the Great Allegheny Passage and C&O Canal Towpath to Washington D.C.; and a float-trip down the Youghiogheny River with a close friend. I called it my “summer of adventure.”Canada to Panama became Canada to El Salvador when I flew home short of my goal. I have a list of excuses why I stopped when I did, not the least being a parasite, but that trip was never about the destination nor is it over. In the fall, after spending the summer thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail, I’ll fly to Argentina where I’ll ride my bicycle from the southern tip of the world — Tierra Del Fuego — to at least as far north as Colombia. I may even continue on to the El Salvador International Airport where I last left off.

Kodak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521660,"In two weeks, I board a bus to Atlanta, Georgia to begin my Appalachian Trail thru-hike. Hiking the AT is among my oldest dreams and one I hope I am able to complete. I feel prepared and ready to begin. I have a lot of experience bike touring which I feel will translate well to life on the trail. It will be different for sure but only in subtle ways. I do worry I will tire of walking. I think I'll be begging for my bike back after a week on the trail. The first week is always the worst! I also worry about my pack weight. I'll be carrying a computer and a heavy camera with two lenses. It will be worth the weight though. And if it isn't, I can always send it home. My hope is to capture the essence of the trail and share it with as many people as I can. I feel lucky to have the freedom to travel the way that I do and I hope to inspire others that would like to do the same.I also enjoy carrying my computer for another reason, it feels like home. There is nothing better on a cold, rainy day than curling up on a foreign couch and watching a movie to keep the blues at bay. The computer slows me down in more ways than added weight. It makes the journey more of a lifestyle as I stop and spend time in places to edit and upload photos along with writing for my blog and journals. Another thing: if I don't carry the computer, I'll have thousands of images to deal with when the trek is over. Not fun. I've made sacrifices to carry the extra weight of the computer, camera, and accessories. I will carry no extra clothing than what I absolutely need. This means one pair of pants and one shirt. Laundry day means I'll be wrapping myself in a sleeping bag liner as a kilt and wearing a rain jacket as a top. I'll make due. I have a feeling I'll be washing clothes in rivers, sinks, and showers more than washing machines anyway. At least this is how it went on my bike tours.Ok, so I guess I'm not making that many sacrifices. By sacrifice, I mean things I would normally carry while bike touring as this is how I'm used to living anyway. I'm practically a gypsy these days though my friends and coworkers call me a hippy. Am I a hippy? I don't wear deodorant and haven't for three or four years. I lived in a squat with a composting toilet for a year before the big bike tour. I lived in a tool trailer for a while after the tour. I've never had lice but, while common amongst communal hippies, certainly isn't a criteria for admission. I don't know. Don't really care either ;-) Anyway, I'm not carrying my little spatula. There's a sacrifice! What will I do on egg day?!! In reality, this will slow down the cleaning and scraping process of my pot, but will have little impact otherwise. Really am gonna miss it on egg days though. Oh well. I doubt my new pot will cook eggs well enough for a spatula anyway. That's about all I have to say on carrying a computer. A few will probably hate me for it. Some will benefit from a movie on a rainy day. Others will get photos out of it. Everyone following along at home gets to experience the trail with me.",,View Entry,"Feb 22, Mon",0
Kodak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521811,"Today I loaded my green and black backpack with the gear I’ll carry for the next six months. I added extra stuff to simulate the weight of food and water. It felt heavy as I slung it onto my shoulder and walked out the door but not terribly so. I needed to return a book to library. Why not test my gear and body in the process? Besides, I required fresh air. I’ve been feeling trapped lately with a lot of rainy days and computer work. I’ve been organizing and editing photos from previous trips. I also created an Instagram account, this trail journal, a 500px account, and have been busy updating my blog. Its all too easy to get lost in the cyber world especially in the photo heavy sites. There are a lot of beautiful photos out there! Anyway, I’m really looking forward to getting lost in the world of trails and trees as I live outside once again. Living outside really is the best. Being indoors these last few months, I find myself getting sinus infections from the stale air. My senses are also dull, my sense of smell most of all.Tomorrow morning, I take a train to New York City with my Great Aunt and Uncle. We’re visiting their son and his family who live in Manhattan. I look forward to seeing everyone. I have not seen my cousin since I was a kid and I don’t think I’ve ever met his family. I also want to stop in a huge camera store in the city, B&H Photo, to pick up a few last items for my hike. I hope I’m not boring anyone with this quick post. My main purpose here is a test of my journaling capabilities. I’ll be carrying a computer which I’ll use to transcribe my handwritten journal, among others things. I’ll send the text file to my smart phone and upload it to this trail journal from there. In a few minutes, I find out if this works.I’ll also be continuing my blog, Tales of Wandering. I’m not entirely sure yet about how this is all going to work. Right now, I’m thinking I’ll host my daily journal here at Trail Journals. I always keep a journal on my travels. I’ll just type it this time and post to the world. My blog will continue as a condensed version of the journal with only the highlights. The blog also uses photos to tell the story. I will use Instagram as well to post pictures as I go. Blog entries wait for towns, wifi, and coffee. Not that I won’t have coffee as I’m walking. I’m kind of addicted to the stuff. Just coffee in a cafe with tables and chairs and nice porcelain mugs. I’m longing for towns already! What am I getting myself into… Anyway, what do you think? Anyone have any tips / ideas / suggestions for how to organize my journal, blog, and photos?",,T-13 days: Testing Gear and Journal,"Feb 25, Thu",0
Kodak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522481,"It’s 1:30am in Glen Burnie, Md and I cannot sleep. In four more days, I board a bus to Georgia to begin my thru-hike on the Appalachian Trail. My bag is packed and ready. Everything else I own is gathering dust in my mother’s attic in Pittsburgh.Yesterday, I returned to my Aunt and Uncles house here in Glen Burnie after six days in New York City. I’ve never felt so out of place. Like a chestnut mustang amidst a herd of zebra. With the hike so close, all I cared to do was walk the city. I tried to take photos but was not very successful. I’m lost in big cities. I did find one subject that captivated my attention: a raccoon in central park eating bread under a tree. I watched it for nearly an hour taking more photos than of anything else.I am glad I went though. I saw family I have not seen in many years and met other family for the first time. I found a bag for my camera in the photography super center, B&H Photo. And I had an epiphany. Sitting in a crowded bar, a flamboyant man played a piano while an eccentric red-haired woman sang a sing-a-long song. When she came to the chorus, she stuck the microphone in the face of the woman sitting next to me. Well, this outgoing woman pulled the mic closer ecstatic for her 15 seconds of fame. I on the other hand, was appalled. I don’t want to sing in public! And public doesn’t want to hear me sing! I crossed my arms displaying my best “don’t even think about it” attitude. Then, I tilted my head back, closed my eyes, and visualized the peace and tranquility I’ll find on the trail.In that moment, I realized something important. I hate crowds. To think I managed to convince myself otherwise! Then again, I had no choice. It was the only way to overcome the social anxiety and panic attacks that plagued my life for years. But, that’s another story.I’m surprised at my inability to sleep. I’m not nervous. I’ve traveled a lot in the last few years including a ten month bike tour from the Canada border to El Salvador. That prepared me for anything. I know how to pack and my bag is ready — a first as I’m usually packing the night before. I know what to expect. I’ll experience new lows that rival the depths of hell and just when I think I can’t take anymore, a beam of light will will transport me Star Trek style to heavenly heights. So I guess it’s excitement and anticipation. I do feel trapped in purgatory. My brain compensates for the endless waiting by obsessing over things I’m not going to change anyway. Mainly gear. I’m a recovering gear junky at risk of falling off the wagon. Oh well. It’s four days. I survived that long being held by a family of narco trafficantes. I can certainly survive this. It is ironic though. I didn’t sleep much worse then and I thought they might kill me. Maybe I’m more nervous than I think...","

I'll continue updating my wordpress acount as well using it as a weekly summary and place to share my photos. Perhaps I'll even post a daily journal there as well.Suggestions are welcome! So please, leave any advice or comments in my register. Thanks and Happy Trails!!!!
By the way, this entry corrects my milage since I am beginning the journal in the middle of the trail. The milage also corrects for a 175 mile section that I must return and finish. I went home for a few weeks and skipped ahead to continue hiking with a friend.

Kodak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541713,"“Oh my god!” I exclaim, water dripping from my hair and running down my chest; mostly from the shower but some because I am already sweating. “That was the best shower I have ever had.” In hindsight, the shower was good. Not the best. I say that all the time. Out here, lost in the moment, it’s an easy expression to over use. When your deprived, everything feels like the “best thing ever.”We set our alarms last night for 6am. We still didn’t get up and going. The fact that we both set alarms, however, is a notable move in the right direction. We seem to be getting serious. And we have to if we’re to make it to Katahdin before the park closes for the winter.We overheard another couples plan. They worked out the numbers and found that, until the Whites, they have to average six 18 miles days per week with one zero. Through the Whites, they must do 11’s or 12’s still able to take one zero a week. I’m not sure if those numbers hold all the way to Katahdin though or if they must hike more after leaving the Whites. Their numbers also allow for ten random zereos. So we woke at 9am on our stealth campsite heading up the hill off the C&O Canal Towpath. We quickly packed and ate some snacks. We started hiking making slow progress. Firecracker wasn’t “in the zone.” She managed a slow, steady pace throughout the day but we took long breaks.By the time we arrived at this campsite, it was nearly 7pm. With free showers and flat ground to pitch a tent (in grass!), the opportunity was to good to pass up. By this point, my butt was chaffing pretty bad anyway. All the hurry up and stop really gets me. I sweat profusely in this heat then dry out when we stop for long periods. When I resume hiking, I’m sticky leading to chafing. The long days don’t help either.","~Weverton Cliffs
",Dahlgren Backpack Campground,"Jul 07, Thu",13
Kodak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541716,"Today was a long day, at least by our recent standards. We need to pick up our daily milage if we are to make it to Katahdin before they close Baxter state Park on October 15th. The date changes every year based on weather conditions, but the 15th is a good deadline. We also need to rush because we have a package waiting in Waynesboro. The Post Office closes at 11:30am.
We woke early today. Well, I woke early. I was up at 5am unable to go back to sleep because of a burning desire to write a book. It’s time for me to get serious out here. This trip was supposed to be more about fun and games. This was intended to be a working trip as well. That’s one of the main reasons I’m carrying a laptop.
Anyway, I woke up and wrote for a while before we packed up and left. I’m proud of us! We left at 8am, almost a record for us. We usually aren’t leaving until 10am and sometimes even later. We’re nearly always the last out of camp.
The miles disappeared behind us as we trudged along, sweat streaming down my shirtless torso. The day was hot, real hot. We stopped for water and lunch at Annapolis Rocks. AWOL has it listed as an outstanding overlook and, while it was a nice view, I would not classify it as outstanding. Not after everything else we’ve seen out here. 
Our lunch break went way too long nearly negating our early start. We started talking and and we’re very good at enabling each other both keeping busy since the other doesnt’ seem to be moving. It is interesting and challenging hiking with a partner. 
We left the rocks and came to the Washington Monument. Now here is a view! 360 degrees above the trees on a stone tower from the 1800’s. Too bad we weren’t here for sunrise or sunset. 
The Don shouted down from the top of the tower as we approached. We took some photos together and chatted for a while before heading out. The rest of the day was somewhat of a blur. I wasn’t eating enough and nearly bonked multiple times. I would notice the tell tale wooziness stopping to eat before it was too late. 
We intended to make it to the Raven Rock shelter tonight. We didn’t. At dark we came to this stream and I made the decision to camp here. It was too beautiful not too and a stealth site was already cleared. We are definitely not the first people to camp here. 
We filtered enough water for dinner then ate. I had mac n’ cheese with tuna. I found the meal, and many others, in a hiker box in Harpers Ferry. After we ate, we stripped down and jumped in the stream washing away the sweat and grime of a long days hike. What could be better! The gurgling of the stream while we sleep? Close.","Dahlgren Backpack Campground

Kodak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541717,"We woke early and tore the tent down before first light. We were camped next to a police shooting range and DID NOT want to be caught. We still hung around for two hours after packing away the tent. We were so tired from our late arrival and early morning that we were incapable of making ourselves move. As a result, I didn’t make it to the Post Office in time to transfer the package from my Mom. Oh well. I’ll call on Monday. Hopefully Kool-Aid mailed my headphones priority so I can have them shipped ahead as well.We passed by a blue-blaze loop trail to High Rock Overlook. Of course we took it. It is very rare for us to skip an overlook. It was certainly worth missing a few white blazes for. The rocks were crazy looking too, all covered in every color spray paint. The graffiti went all the way down the rock face as well. Sad, but different and kinda cool.We made it into Pen Mar State Park just before 11:30am when the Post Office was closing. I had to poop so bad though, that it was closed before my business was concluded. No big deal. Like I said, I’ll just call Monday morning. And older man approached us and asked if we wanted a ride into town. He told us to jump in the back of his old blue pickup. The bed was full of car parts and randomness. The driver side leaf spring (?) was broken so the truck sagged real bad to this side. We hopped in, barely fitting and trying not to cut ourselves on jagged steel, and hung on for the ride. It felt like a roller coaster! All rides in vehicles do after walking for so long but this one was different still. With the truck sagging as it was and with no suspension, every bend felt like we were going to be thrown out of the truck. Fun times though!We sat at the now closed Post Office (where he dropped us off afraid of going further with us in the back. It’s illegal in PA) going through our food bags and making a shopping list. Then, we walked to Walmart and purchased a little bit of food. We found a bunch of dinners in a shelter mailbox for the register so we didn’t need much. I was going to bounce the package from my mom for this reason. We hung out charging our phones and making calls.We walked to Goodwill after. We both bought running shorts and I bought a baby blanket. I mailed my sleeping bag home after Shenandoah, but nights have been a little cold still for just my sleeping bag liner. The blanket barely covers my torso but will suffice. Everything is a compromise between weight and comfort out here. Hitchhiking out of town was, once again, super easy. It helps having a cute girl with me. The woman who picked us up drove us to the top of High Rock, the overlook we passed earlier, where we sat talking and taking in the view. We spent nearly an hour up there with her. People are so wonderful.She told us the fourth of July fireworks show would be tonight. It was cancelled last week due to weather. We ate dinner watching the sunset from Pen Mar SP then watched the firework display. When everyone left, we walked onto the stage of the pavilion and cowboy camped.","Warner Gap Hollow, Stream

Kodak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541718,"We woke early on the stage of the pavilion and hiked out with only a quick snack. The number one rule of stealth camping is don’t get caught. We didn’t intend to. After a fast few tenths of a mile, we came to the state line. Six states down!!! Waahoooo!!!! Some people were camped here so we snapped a few photos and headed off to the water source where we ate a more substantial breakfast.The rest of the day was about making miles. We were exhausted from the late night and early morning. We figured the sooner we got to camp, the sooner we could go to sleep. It’s also a nice change, pushing a fast pace. It’s easier hiking in this weather too. It’s so dag gone hot that once I stop for a while, I don’t want to get going again.We ate lunch at the Antietam Shelter after bathing in the stream. Boy did it feel good! I laid down in the swift current allowing the cool, spring-fed water to wash away the sweat and stench of days of hiking. The shelter was built in 1940, an original from Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The shelter site was filthy with trash in the fire rings, broken glass everyday, and a ham-bone decomposing in the stream obiously pitched in there after someones dinner. The shelter overeer of the next shelter said it will soon be disassembled and placed somewhere else on the trail.We hiked for a while with The Don and kept bumping into Cruzer, Thumper, and Texas Hippy. Such good people. It was really nice hiking with The Don. It’s only been Firecracker and me for a while now. Different company and conversation was nice change of pace.The shorts I bought yesterday performed SOO well. Almost zero chaffing. I started to on one occasion but pulling them a little higher allowed the fabric of the legs to take the friction instead of my inner thighs. This may be too much information, but I wore them without under as they have a liner. Worked well.We sat and talked with The Don and 13-Sunrays before heading down into the shelter. Even after talking for a while, we were still here by 6pm. This is really great for us. I’m proud. Water was nowhere near the .5 that AWOL says and the shelters — there are two each sleeping four — are flawless. The site isn’t used much. The logbook dates back to November 2014. We were the only ones here until dark when another couple rolled in.","Pen Mar State Park

It feels good to be here, familiar in some weird way. The rest of the trail has this same sentiment. I rode a bicycle to Maine in 2012 passing through nearly all of the states I’m now about to walk through. It will be nice. On the bike, I saw the coastline. Walking, I’ll see the interior of these states.We did not go far today. We posted up at the shelter before rt. 30 last night then hitched into Chambersburg this morning. The screen protector on Firecrackers phone cracked so she needed to have it replaced. We intended to go into town early, but we got stuck in the shelter this morning. Me, writing and importing photos; Firecracker, sleeping in for a change. An older woman picked us up moments after sticking out our thumbs. She’s a hiker herself and knows these woods well. In November, her and her husband hiked rim-to-rim in the Grand Canyon and used a loop off the AT to train. She worked hard reducing the loop time from four hours to three. Nice work! She lives only a few minutes from the trail but was kind enough to drive out of her way to take us into Chambersburg. The Verizon store warrantied her screen protector. We bought hummus and pita chips for lunch at the Giant next door. Then, we plugged in our electronics at the coffee shop and I stepped into my mobile office.Hours past before we left the coffee shop. We had a 1.2 mile walk back to rt. 30 in under the scorching sun. Those shopping centers are deserts. This is really emphasized when the last four months of your life have been lived in the woods. My goodness are those treeless stretches of pavement hot. A Mcdonalds dollar cheeseburger called my name when we arrived at rt. 30. The golden arch did its job pulling me in. Normally, I avoid fast food. It doesn’t make me feel so good. But, when you’ve walked as far as we have, I think I’m entitled to a cheap burger form time to time. Get that fire hot enough and it’ll burn anything you put in there. Then again, on a bike tour I ate a footlong hotdog as thick as my wrist. I was sick to my stomach for the rest of the night.By the time we tried hitching out of town it was after 7pm. Cars kept wizzing past and Firecracker gave up hope. She called the hostel in Fayetteville to see if they would shuttle us to the trail. “Only if you spend the night at the hostel,” they said. But, it didn’t matter. Before anything was settled, a man stopping for full offered us a ride. “I’m not going that far but let me ask my brother.” They came out and their SUV whisked us away to the trail.I don’t know what or why, but I was super happy for the rest of the night. I had that bubbly, infectious happiness that can only be expressed in excited shouts. I’ll take it wherever it came from. It’s time for bed now. We have to be up at 6am if we intend to make it to the half gallon challenge before the store closes at 7pm.","Rocky Mountain Shelters

This morning we woke up and hiked our butts off to make it to the Pine Grove general store in time to eat half-a-gallon of ice-cream. Firecracker put it best just a second ago, “I can’t believe I hiked that hard just to hurt myself more.” She’s still not feeling so well. I’m not either, but not because of the ice-cream. Her farts are nauseating! I quite enjoyed myself. I even washed all that ice-cream down with a California Burger. Its special for having avocado.If eating all that ice-cream felt good, so did crossing the halfway point. Wahooo!!! Oh, we’re halfway there. Oh oh! Living on a prayer. Take my hand we’ll make it I swear. Funny thing is, it barely registered at the time. We were too focused on the ice-cream challenge. Now, sitting here in the tent, the milestone has sunk in. Over four months it has taken us to walk this far. We’re over the hump. The rest of the trail is going to fly by and, before we know it, will all be over. Firecracker will be back in Georgia with her family and friends. Me? I’m not so sure. I’ll go home for a little while; at least long enough to get my bicycle and see my own family and friends. For the most part though, Pittsburgh isn’t home anymore. The road is. My tent is. I didn’t mean for this post to dig so deep. This is all just coming out as I type. I have a lot to figure out. And at the same time, nothing at all. Life is weird and simple if we don’t complicate it too much.I can, and maybe should for my own sake, write an entire post on the pros and cons of the lifestyle I’ve chosen. So many sacrifices for adventure and experience. I don’t regret a minute of it though. Not now at least. I’ve been calling this the five year plan for three years now. Still calling it the five year plan too!Anyway, I met some really awesome people today. At the first shelter past Caledonia SP, Querry Gap Shelters, sitting at the table was Huckleberry and… damn! I forgot her name. Huckleberry was punching away at the keys of a computer. I’m not the only one! He’s filming a documentary on the trail. What’s the focus? He’s not sure yet. Just filming what interests him. We leapfrogged each other for a while before hiking together and talking. It was a pleasure meeting him and I hope to hike with him more. A bunch of people that we’ve been bumping into the last couple weeks were at the general store as well. Night watch and Snow White; Cruzer and Texas Hippie (who I’ve never actually talked to). I’m not sure where Thumper was. I hope he’s alright. I know he was having some issues with shin splints. I met Jefe for the first time here as well. He was not doing so well having eaten a gallon of ice-cream. That’s right. A half-gallon wasn’t challenging enough (it really isn’t :-) so he went big. Oh to be young and fool hardy! Haha. Some things just aren’t worth the pain. Then again, many people would say that about the AT or riding a bicycle across a continent. Bet none of you would though!Time for bed though. We have another early morning. No idea where we are headed only that a lake calls our name. It’s time for a real swim!!!P.S. Learned to double space returns in my writing program. Sorry about earlier formatting troubles.","Caledonia State Park

Kodak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542001,"Wednesday July 13th, 2016Pine Grove Furnace SP (1101.7)Pine Grove Furnace SP (1101.7)0 Miles —->Total AT Miles: 926.7I’m sitting at the Pine Grove Furnace SP General Store suppress the urge to eat another half gallon of ice-cream. I did eat a small amount of ice-cream after a burger and a bunch of french fries. I immediately regretted the decision. I should have just bought the 1.5 quart tub! I do love my ice-cream.Our day turned into a lazy one. We woke at 9am rewarding ourselves for our efforts yesterday by sleeping in. We walked to the lake where we ate breakfast and drank coffee. We swam some laps in the refreshingly cool lake tiring our limbs just as the rain began. We hid under the canopy of trees until the downpour passed then walked to the shower. After washing free the sand and sediment from the lake, we walked to the general store where we’ve been ever since. It was fun watching hikers come through and force down their halfway reward. There are so many fewer hikers now. The end of the bubble is near. Some young section hikers attempted the challenge as well. Some fared better than others with most stopping short in the first 1.5quart tub. A kid on a day trip with his family crushed the challenge and with an interesting technique: he squeezed the ice-cream from the tub chowing down without a spoon. It is after 7pm now. The general store is closed. Still, a few hikers remain. Two girls, section hiking on break from college, are walking on to complete a marathon hike (26 miles). Another hiker sits cooking mac n’ cheese with tuna for dinner. We will sit a while longer then walk to the campground to shower and sleep. Tomorrow, we plan to hike to Boiling Springs where we’ll camp just before town. I am waiting on a package from my mother. Happy Trails everybody!!! Kodak signing off.","Pine Grove State Park
