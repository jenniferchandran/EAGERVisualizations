Old Drum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534509,"It poured all night and we'll into the day. I tried to wait for the rain to stop, but I just wasted hiking time by staying in my tent for a break in the rain. I ended up taking down my tent in the rain. It was harder than yesterday with the rain and a ridge line of several miles called the Ledges. I slipped 3 times on wet rocks that were smooth, wet, and on 45 degree angles. Murf,Snickers and Elsa helped me. Two of the falls were easy, but the other really hurt my left hip. Also saw Echo, Forest, Sarah and David, and Alpaca who has bad shin splint.","House Ruins

Old Drum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534512,"This was a very painful day. The hip injury from Tuesday hurt all day. It especially hurt when I got up or down. Had lunch with Forest, Sarah and David. I did not take the side trip to Dragon's Tooth. This time I did make the trip. It is an awesome rock. The trail down from that area is nuts. It is so tricky without rain, but of course it rained this afternoon. I got great help from Murph, Doolittle, Snickers and Elsa.","Niday Shelter

Once I got cleaned up. I went to a clinic where I was x-rayed for a break. Good news is that there is no break. However, I have a deep purple bruise that is 8"" by 6"" solid. Told to take massive amounts of ibuprofen, ice the bruise and elevate the hip.","Campsite before VA 624

Old Drum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535739,"Today I was released to begin hiking. I was told to keep it from 5 to 10 miles. If things are OK, I can do more tomorrow. I was not allowed to stretch today and for the first time on any hike my calves hurt. The hike was so short that I took many long breaks and still quit early. I am camping alone near Wilson Creek. On this spot was once a charcoal factory. Met Ron Paul and his partner Smash. Saw the couple from Utah that I last saw on Blood Mountain. Also saw Bumpy, Sarah and David today.","Howard Johnson Motel

There were trash cans, picnic tables and car pullouts with great views. I got a phone signal and called Ivana Sherpa. She tells me that cars are not currently allowed on that part of the Parkway. The hip was OK on the hike and yesterday's calf issue is gone. I quit very early again, but was very tired.","Wilson Creek

Old Drum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535758,"Last night was really hard on me. I got very little sleep as the hip throbbed all night. I reached Cornelius Creek Shelter by 3 p.m. and quit really early. There was a young German couple there who had also quit for the day. The next shelter and the next campsite were banned from camping because of aggressive bears in the area. That meant that I would have to do over 20 miles on my still tender hip. Today was my second day in a row with no rain. Saw several interesting lizards today. Met Salami, a PCT 15 thru hiker. Also saw the Germans, Out Back and the two sisters, one who reminds me of Hallie Anderson.","Cove Mountain Shelter

I got ahead of him on the last of a climb. I waited at the Guietine to take his picture. Several other hikers passed and I took their photos. It is a fun formation. Jingles and Sweets, who I first met in the Smokies were at my final campsite along with ETA, and many other hikers. This is the only campsite for many miles because of closures of shelters and campsites because of bears. I got a text from Ivana Sherpa that she was on the way to pick me up at James River Bridge.","Cornelius Creek Shelter

Old Drum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535773,"Bumpy and I hiked together today. We got to the Foot Bridge before 10. Ivana was walking down the trail towards us. It was so good to see her. She had done some trail magic for hikers before I arrived. She did some for Jingles and Sweets plus several others before taking Bumpy to Glasgow for his resupply. We said goodbye to him and several other hikers at the town hiker shelter and then drove to Belmont, NC to see our oldest daughter's family.","Marble Spring

Old Drum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535781,"When I started, I thought I might thru hike the AT again. I learned the following. At 70, I have stronger legs for walking than I did at 60. I am still slow, but I can hike 12 hours a day. I have regained my 60 year old throwing arm. Last year on the 388 mile AT section hike with my wife, I could not get my food bag hung without help. This time I had help only twice and I think I could have done those with more time. I also learned that my sense of balance is not good enough. I spent the last winter working on my throwing arm and I got better. I will be working on balance now as well. Finally, I already knew that the biggest thing a thru hiker needs is a strong desire to go all the way. I tried, but I just never got the ""want to."" I also came to the realization that there are 3 passions in my life right now. They are hiking, wrestling and my wife, Ivana Sherpa or BJ. 6 months is more than I want to be away from her at the remaining years I have left. Before this hike 4 of my last 5 hikes had been with her. The only one without her, I quit because I was lonely. I told her that unless she was with me, all my remaining hikes will be confined to 500 miles. The hip is still bothering me, but just barely. There is a possible bike ride across Nebraska in early July. We will be celebrating 50 years of marriage this July in Wheeling, WV. Thank you for following my hike and for the nice notes of support. Many blessings for you. See you later Judy. Old Drum",,Home ,"May 28, Sat",0
