Fox Moon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539818,"Pilgrim and I caught the bus in Madison and journeyed to Union Station in Chicago where we boarded the Capital Limited Amtrak train to Harpers Ferry. There were some very nice views along the way, but the pictures I took seemed to be picking up all the light reflections they were capable of finding in the train windows. We splurged and shared a two berth roomette on the train as I always find it hard to get a good nights sleep in coach. For my trip back from Staunton in 18 days I figure that will not be a problem. The picture shows us in front of the Chazen Art Museum on the University of Wisconsin campus where we boarded the bus. We look so tidy and clean.",,Harpers Ferry,"May 17, Tue",0
Fox Moon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539822,"We arrive in Harpers Ferry around noon. After getting stove fuel and tortillas at Outfitters General Store we go in search of lunch. The Cannonball Deli suites our purpose, and then we trek the mile to the Econo Lodge, where we are staying tonight, to drop off our packs. We take another route to hike back into town, and explore the historic sites and take a few pictures. Ok, maybe more than a few. We stop by the AT offices to check it out and meet the through hiker Walnut who is waiting for family to arrive. It seems a little odd to essentially be on vacation and to have interesting AT merchandise in front of me, but also to realize that I can’t/won’t buy any of it because I already have all the clothing I will need on the trail and I certainly will not be adding any more weight to my pack.","Harpers Ferry

Fox Moon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539980,"We have breakfast at the motel and are out the door just after 7 AM. The busy Highway 340 bridge takes us across the Shenandoah river and to our first climb.   I take a few pictures. Low clouds and fog hide the tops of the hills in front of us. The trail climbs quickly and it doesn’t take us long before we start meeting thru-hikers on the trail. Viet Nam Vet is planning to catch the train in Harpers Ferry for some time off and to meet with his doctor. This first day was meant to be low-mileage to ease us into extended hiking, but we arrive at our destination, the David Lesser shelter, by 1 PM. It has a nice porch area, but water is a bit of a walk down the hill. We meet Top Knot who is doing the four state challenge. After eating lunch we decide to continue on to the Blackburn Trail Center. We arrive around 4 PM after a very challenging trail down to the Center and pitch our tents at the camp site. We are not sure how many hikers will be coming later so we initially see if we can fit both our tents on one pad. It will not work so we each take our own pad. We get our first experience with hanging our food on a bear pole and appreciate not having to mess with a rope and a tree. Later, I had enough energy to hike back up to the AT for better phone reception and to take some sunset pictures.","Harpers Ferry

Fox Moon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539985,"We are still fairly new to the whole trail packing thing, so It takes us a while to pull everything together. I had worried about setting an alarm to wake up by, but it turns out I have nothing to worry about. The birds are loud enough to wake me every morning by 5:30 or so. We eventually get on the trail and head south. Pilgrim and I find our own hiking rhythms. He tends to walk deliberately with few breaks. I will often go faster, especially on uphills, but I also like to take lots of pictures. This will often put me behind him before eventually catching up. It all seems to even out. We have great weather these first two days. We are hearing from several hikers on the trail that the previous two weeks have had some period of rain almost every day.I got pictures of several types of flowers this morning. My AT&T cell service seems to be doing better than Pilgrim’s Verizon service on this part of the trail. The weather forecast calls for rain tomorrow, so when we arrive at Bear’s Den hostel mid-afternoon we have already decided that we will be staying here and taking advantage of having a shower, laundry facilities, and a bed. We have only been hiking two days so a frozen pizza and pint of ice cream each seems a little over the top. Pilgrim and I split a pizza then each have our own pint of Ben & Jerry’s. There is a viewpoint close to Bear’s Den, but clouds have begun to move in already and there is no sunset picture.","Blackburn Trail Center

Fox Moon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539987,"A light rain is falling, but we get an early start after a breakfast of pancakes. My rain gear is getting its first test and it seems to be doing ok. Pilgrim is using a poncho that also covers his pack, which seems to work well enough, as long as it stays on straight and does not shift to one side or the other. The rain has caused the streams to fill and we came across our first “huh, how are we getting across that without falling” stream this morning. Pilgrim went first and I had my camera ready in case he fell in. As it turned out I was the one who fell today as I was walking the trail. I stepped on an angled wet rock and my left foot slipped inward while my planted hiking pole was ahead of my right foot. I did not go down hard, but having 40 extra pounds on your back makes scrambling back upright on wet ground a process. I scratched up my wrist a little, but otherwise came out of it with only some wounded pride. Around noon we caught up to a scout troop, also hiking south, at the Buzzard Hill view point. 
I am realizing that this is a great opportunity to do birding since I have a birding app on my phone and there are a variety of birds we are seeing that I am unfamiliar with. However, Pilgrim and I still have a certain anxiety about getting to each night’s campsite in a reasonable time, so we do not tarry too long in any once place. Our stop this evening after 9.8 wet miles is Rod Hollow Shelter. After a day of rain the last half-mile to the shelter has become a marsh. It is our first stay in a shelter and we are very grateful to not have to put up tents in the rain. The shelter has a main sleeping platform and an upper shelf, kind of like a balcony, that will sleep three people. I take the upper shelf and Pilgrim takes an end on the main floor space. I see a mouse in the rafters scurrying away as I put out my pad and sleeping bag. After we get settled Iris, Again, and Tag Along file into camp and also set up in the shelter. The scouts have taken over most of the cooking pavilion, but we find a corner to set up our stove and cook dinner. I find that my body seems to be accommodating to daily long hikes in odd ways. During the night I find I have to go to the bathroom several times.","Bear's Den Hostel

Fox Moon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539991,"It looks to be a rainy cool day, but at least we are starting out dry. I don’t think Pilgrim and I were in a hurry to hit the trail. We joked with Iris, Again, and Tag Along about which group would actually hit the trail first. Many thanks to Iris who told me about the ""Trail Journals"" web site and her own photos and journal on the site. 
The beginning of the day presented some nice “mist in the trees” photo ops, but by early afternoon it was raining steadily and I stopped taking pictures and kept my camera tucked inside my rain jacket out of the cold wet. At one point I spotted a salamander confidently slide-crawling and totally enjoying the total wetness on the trail. We reached Dick’s Dome shelter by 2 PM and there was only one person already there. While small, the shelter had a picturesque stream right outside the entrance, and it was dry. However, Pilgrim did not feel good about only doing 8.4 miles and stopping so early in the day, so we pushed on to Manassas Gap shelter. 
When we arrived at the shelter 3 hours later it was full and all the camp sites were taken. After looking around for potential non-official tent sites we decide to squeeze into a muddy area near two other tents. It’s raining and Pilgrim and I have exactly the same model of tent, so we decide to team up to pitch each of our tents quickly in sequence. Pilgrim goes for water while I try to see if I can set up some rocks in a semblance of something flat to put our cooking stove on. By the time he gets back I am shivering in the wet cold and he suggests I go in my tent and change into dry clothing. I take him up on the offer and also persuade him to heat up a couple cups of water for my folding sink, and I give myself a spit-bath in my tent before changing into dry clothes. To simplify things we each have a 2 serving Mountain House meal to ourselves and don’t mess with trying to split it up equally. We have the extra Mountain House and the cold and wet probably burned plenty of extra calories today anyway. I have the meal in my tent and have no problems finishing it. During the night I find that, again, I need to use the restroom several times. This is getting old in the rain.","Rod Hollow Shelter

Fox Moon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540118,"Sometime during the night it finally stopped raining, but it is still overcast and cool this morning. I had tucked my boots under cover last night, but the toes were exposed and I found I had to pour water out of my boots this morning. The dry socks on my feet stayed that way for only a few seconds after putting them in my boots. Even though we have no rain today the trail is very mucky from the last two days of rain. I brought sunglasses for this hike but I don’t think I have used them once. We are walking through a canopy of trees almost all the time. When we do come to a clearing or a viewpoint it merits a picture or two, or three. If you just looked at my pictures you would probably think we had meadows and long views half the time. As we hike this morning we discuss where we will stay tonight. The push to Manassas has put us ahead of schedule but at an awkward distance for a campsite this evening. I addition we have a lot of wet gear. Tom Floyd Wayside is the obvious candidate, but it has a tough climb at the end of the day, and it puts us vey close to the following day’s stop. We have a reservation and a resupply box waiting for us at the Front Royal Terrapin Station Hostel on the 24th. We decide to see if we can stay at the hostel for two nights starting this evening. I call Mike at the hostel and he has plenty of room this evening. He even offers to pick us up at the US 522 crossing. I politely decline as we are feeling good and do not want to impose on him. We have lunch at the Jim & Molly Denton shelter. We eat at the covered picnic area. The shelter looks very nice, but there is a hiker or camper and his dog who is drying out his tent and gear all over the deck and chairs. I take off my boots while I eat and notice my feet and the boots are steaming. The damp is really bringing out the centipedes and millipedes. The centipedes are a very colorful combination of black, yellow, and orange so I try to see if I can get a good close-up of one.   As we approach US 522 Pilgrim and I realize that we have a tough uphill before circling back down to the hostel. We decide to take Mike up on his offer and get a ride to the hostel. When we arrive there are a lot of tents and gear already on the clothes line outside. We are not the only hikers taking time to dry out equipment. We get a surprise in the evening when a small thunderstorm passes through and dumps some pea-sized hail on us for about 10 minutes. Staying at the hostel tonight is looking more and more like a very smart decision. Pilgrim takes advantage of the frozen food and snacks one can purchase at the hostel. I, however, am very aware that I still have food in my pack and I have a resupply box filled with 14 pounds of food that is waiting to go in my pack. I decide to eat from my supply.","Manassas Gap Shelter

Fox Moon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540122,"In the morning we go into town so that Pilgrim and I can pick up some grocery items and find a good breakfast. The tortillas have worked well for me and I would like to pick up a fresh supply. He has decided that single potion retorts of tuna work well on the trail. I packed some for myself along with individual mayo packets for each one. He looks for individual mayo packets but we can’t find any. Pilgrim has also found that flip flops are not ideal for him as camp shoes. My camp shoes are a variation on water shoes. They are not perfect but have been working pretty well. 
In the evening Mike drives Pilgrim, Shoe, and I into town so Pilgrim can buy camp shoes, and we can stuff ourselves at the Jalisco Mexican restaurant. It was very good. They must have a lot of hikers come because their portions are quite generous. At some point on the trail a hiker’s body starts craving calories and they become ravenous. It has definitely not hit me yet. I am barely able to finish what is on my plate.In the valley east of the AT the map shows that there are many wineries. For our rest/zero day I thought it might be interesting to check one out if feasible. Of course transportation is going to be an issue, but I see that one of the wineries with a tasting room is only a couple of miles down the road from the hostel. Unfortunately, when we drive by it on the way to Front Royal we see that it is only open on weekends. Oh well","Front Royal Terrapin Station Hostel

Fox Moon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540287,"We get an early start and arrive at Gravel Springs Hut in Shenandoah National Park (SNP) by early afternoon. For the time being we seem to have the camp site to ourselves. It is sunny and clear. I decide to test the feasibility of a couple things I have not tried yet on the trail. I have brought a foldable 2 liter sink with me, so I fill it with water from the stream and take it and a washcloth out to a semi-private area behind the privy. It feels good to wipe off the sweat from a day of hiking and put on clean clothes. This is definitely worth trying again if I can work out the privacy issue. The 13L dry sack I pack all my clothes in can also be used to wash clothes. It is called the Scrubba Wash Bag and has internal nubs that act as a washboard. It is pretty slick. I wash today’s hiking clothes and hang them to dry. What I find is that it is also very important to have a towel to roll your clothes in after washing to get most of the water out before hanging to dry. I did not do that and I had some items that did not dry completely by the end of the evening. I am beginning to realize I packed too much food for this hiking section. I packed as if for the next eight days I would only be eating from my pack. But we are in SNP with multiple opportunities to eat at a grill or restaurant, or shop at a camp store. People at camp made gentle fun of my red seemingly Santa bag-sized food bag. My 55L backpack is barely able to hold everything and it is heavy. My combined pack weight without food and water is about 30 pounds, so I was easily carrying 45 pounds today. I say combined pack weight because, in addition to my main pack, I also have a small two-chamber pack (Ribz pack) that clips together over my ribs. It holds 4-5 pounds of food and gear. I keep my camera and stuff I want close at hand and easy to get to in this pack. I have also found that I can tuck the lens end of my camera in between by breastbone and the pack so it does not swing free on my neck cord, and is easy to grab with one hand to quickly take a picture.We had our first bear sighting today. A bear kept circling the camp site this evening looking for food. It was very persistent despite our yelling and even throwing a few stones towards it. I walked back uphill towards Skyline drive to get cell reception and call Gayle. While there I saw a deer and fawn crossing the road. By the end of the evening there are a lot of people at the shelter. The shelter and picnic table is the social hub of the whole campsite. A large number of hikers know each other from the trail and it feels like Pilgrim and I have stepped into a well-formed community of people. We meet lots of neat people including: Veggie Stew (or possibly Stu) is a young English teacher from Birmingham England. El Tejano (The Texan) is about my age. His Trail Journal is definitely worth looking up. He has posted a lot of pictures and many stories of his journey thus far. It was amazing to me that he could write so much information while he was on the trail, but then I read in one of his posts that he dictates his journal. He then sends it electronically to his wife at home who transcribes it and posts it to the Trail Journal web site. That explains how he does but it is still quite impressive to me.","Front Royal Terrapin Station Hostel

Fox Moon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540353,"I saw several bears this morning on the trail, but I do not have any good pictures of them. They tend to run away quickly in the brush. I thought I had one good picture when the bear I startled went up a tree, but I depended on the autofocus on my camera and it focused on the trees in front of the bear. SNP has more view areas than the first part of our journey. I took several pictures at various view points. We stopped at the Elkwallow Wayside for lunch, bathrooms, and to recharge our phones. I brought a external battery with me on this hike but have not had to use it thus far. The Grill at the wayside was not working but we each had blackberry ice cream. Tonight we slept in the shelter at Pass Mountain Hut. I notice I the beginnings of blisters on the front pads of both my feet. I apply moleskin to get my feet prepared for tomorrow. I think all the downhill hiking with extra weight is beginning to take its toll. I stubbed the front pad of my left foot on a sharp rock going to the spring behind the shelter. Right on the blistered area. I was a little surprised it did not bleed. I will definitely need the Ibuprofen tonight. We found another use for my foldable sink today. The small pool at the spring was fairly shallow and made using the pump filter difficult without sucking up mud. So we used the sink to collect water as it came out of the pipe and then filtered from the sink. There are a fair number of section hikers like us at the shelter this evening. We also met the thru-hiker Spoon. He has a chopped-down serving spoon to use as his everyday spoon, and makes generous use of oatmeal and coconut oil as a food mainstay.","Gravel Springs Hut

Fox Moon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540355,"Some very nice views and some rocky steep inclines today. We had lunch in the shelter at Pinnacle Picnic Grounds. I took the opportunity to take off my boots and let my feet air out a bit. Based upon our daily progress it seems reasonable to camp near Skyland Lodge tonight. Unfortunately, there are no campsites near Skyland Lodge. I suggest staying at Skyland Lodge and call several times to inquire about availability and making a reservation. However, it is Memorial Day Weekend. There is no room at the inn. We arrive at Skyland and rest and rehydrate in the air-conditioned lobby hoping that something might open up last minute. Nothing does and thunderstorms are building in the west and coming this way. Our options are to find a place to dry camp and hang bear bags, or push on to Rock Spring Hut. We decide to push on but realize it would be best to eat a semblance of dinner now before we start out. Pilgrim gets a sandwich at the snack bar and I, aware of how much food I am carrying, dip into my overgenerous supply of trail snacks.We head out and make good time, but I begin to notice hot spots on both my little toes. I do not want to take the time to stop and take care of them. When we got to the shelter I have blisters on both toes. We grab a couple spots in the shelter and I break out the moleskin. The shelter and campsites quickly fill up with hikers. We are really seeing the full extent of the bubble of thru-hikers traveling north. The thunderstorms do not materialize but we do get a rain shower in the evening.We find out that mice are really bad in this shelter. I was asked to not sweep the upper shelf where I will be sleeping because it would create airborne mouse dust. As I prepare for bed I watch as several mice scurry around the rafters and investigate packs. As I am sleeping during the night I have an arm resting upon the edge of the top sleeping platform. I feel a mouse run across my arm which startles me awake. I fling my arm away from me and the mouse falls to the floor below. Not a good nights sleep between the mice and lots of people moving around making noise.","Pass Mountain Hut

Fox Moon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541073,"We needed a reboot after the last couple of days. Pilgrim has a plan so we strike out quickly without cooking breakfast or getting more water. We make good time at the beginning, but I run out of water and my pace begins to slow. We finally come to a stream and I get to use my Sawyer water bottle and filter for the first time. It works well but is really meant for sipping directly from the bottle and not transferring filtered water to another container like the bladder in my pack. I do not have a good place to keep the bottle within easy reach. After 3.5 miles we get to Big Meadows campground. We start our laundry and then take turns at the pay showers. Now suitable clean and pressed we walk to the Big Meadows Lodge and have a wonderful late breakfast. I think the hunger is beginning to kick in. I have no problem finishing off the breakfast and the side of pancakes I added to the order.I realize I have held some preconceived notions of who we would be meeting on the trail. There are more hikers my age, there are more women, and there are more dogs as hiking companions than I thought there would be. I also did not anticipate the number of foreigners we have met. It is a very diverse community on the trail.I have seen a handful of people hiking while listening to earphones. I guess the constant stream of trees day after day after day could get old if one is thru-hiking, but the thought of plugging in while hiking has not entered my mind. I had downloaded some podcasts before I left home, but have only listened to them a couple of times in the evening while in my tent. Of course, not plugging music into my ears on the trail has not prevented the occasional endless song from playing in my head. On this day it has been (Hey Baby) Que Paso by the Texas Tornados.After our mouse experience last night I think we are through with shelters for a while. When we get to Bear Fence Mountain Hut we quickly find a couple of sites for our tents and set them up. The ones we find that look good are a fair distance from the social hub of the shelter, but that is ok. There is also a large flat stump near my tent that is perfect for cooking on. After dinner a deer casually walked through the camp site.","Rock Spring Hut

Fox Moon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541075,"A deer also walked through camp this morning. The side trail we took yesterday to get to the campsite takes an “L” down from the AT. This morning I see a couple of hikers taking a short cut from the camp site back up to the AT by going up a dry creek bed behind our tents. Early in our hike this morning we walk by Lewis Mountain campground. There is no reason to stop as there is no Grill or camp store here. Flowers catch my attention today. There are lots of Spiderwort along the trail. I experiment with some shots using them as an in-focus foreground element with Pilgrim walking away in background. One comes out pretty well.Shenandoah has a number of cabins in the park that people can rent far in advance. We ran into a couple of birders this morning who I think may have been staying at one of the cabins. They told us that a tropical depression had come ashore on the coast and was bringing rain later today. By the time we got to Swift Run Gap where Highway 33 cuts through the SNP the rain is beginning to fall. We saw another hiker we had met earlier on the trail hitching a ride on Skyline Drive. Pilgrim looked in his guidebook and saw there was a motel (Country View Lodging Motel) just three miles down the road. The guidebook also mentioned the motel could provide transportation from the gap. However, when we called the motel no one was answering the phone, so we started walking down Highway 33 trying to hitch a ride. The road quickly lost its shoulder and it would have been unsafe for someone to stop for us. We hiked the full distance to the motel and got a room for the night. The motel has a washer and dryer for guests to use, so we were also able to do our laundry. I had a Mountain House two-serving beef stew from my oversupply of food, and Pilgrim had a chicken pot pie from the supply of frozen entrees sold in the motel lobby. There was a steady drizzle all evening.","Bear Fence Mountain Hut

Fox Moon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541078,"In the morning the rain had stopped and the motel owner gave us a ride back to Swift Run Gap for a very modest fee of five dollars for the both of us. He charges for the trip not per hiker. The clouds dissipated and we had a nice sunny day for hiking. I got a number of photos of flowers as well as shots of the surrounding valley from viewpoints on the trail. For lunch we took a side trail to the Simmons Gap Ranger Station. We were able to eat at a picnic table and get water from a faucet nearby. Sidenote:I mentioned earlier that I purchased tortillas for the trail. They seem to be a backpacker staple. They pack flat, are fairly easy to find in large and small stores, and keep for several days. For filling I cycled through three options to provide variety: Peanut butter and bacon bits; single serve tuna pouches; and a mixture of dried refried beans, instant rice, and powdered cheese. For the bean-rice dry mix I would add non-heated water to the plastic bag just before getting on the trail in the morning and it would be rehydrated and ready for me whenever I had lunch. YumButter is probably a regional brand, but they have a 7 oz squeeze Go Pack of peanut butter and almond butter that I brought and used on the trail. Its modest size, small screw cap, and the fact that it was a squeeze packet made it very packable and convenient. Tuna by itself can be dry, so I packed individual mayo packets to mix in. I also experimented with using pilot crackers on this trip. They worked ok, they are less fragile than regular crackers, but I still had to treat them very carefully in my pack. They have a very slight sweetness to them, so I found that they also worked very well with Nutella. I packed a few individual serving size packets of Nutella I had found at World Market. World Market also has a variety of small packaged sausages.It was only another couple of miles to Pinefield Hut, so we got there mid-afternoon. The side trail from the hut to the tent sites was steep and took us out of view of the hut. It was fairly private so I filled my folding sink from the nearby spring and did a quick “sponge” bath behind my tent.","Country View Lodging Motel

Fox Moon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544766,We got an early start this morning and got on the trail by 6:30. I got a picture of a bright orange lizard or salamander that I had heard other hikers talking about. After looking it up later I found that the specimen I photographed is a Red-spotted Newt in its terrestrial juvenile stage. There were wildfires in SNP in April. They had to close down a portion of the AT for a while. We walked through some of the burned area this morning. Plants are already springing back to life out of the ashes. As we dipped down into a valley we walked along a very picturesque stream. I took a few pictures at the point where we crossed it. When we got back up to the ridge we could look across the valley and see that the burned areas were not solid. It looked a bit like a patchwork quilt on the opposite hillside. For lunch we stopped at the Loft Mountain Campground store for tortillas and Gatorade. It is a new very nice store with a breezeway where we set up to eat lunch. I briefly thought about a shower but ended up with washing my face and neck at the sink. Further down the trail we stopped at the Dundo picnic area for a bathroom break and a quick rest. Mid-afternoon we arrived at Blackrock Hut and found a couple of tent sites away from shelter and near a stream. As I was doing chores by my tent a bear surprised me and fellow hiker as it came crashing through the underbrush. She yelled at it and it stood up and then quickly high-tailed away from us. I don’t think it knew we were there until she yelled. During the night a Whip-poor-will and an accomplice kept calling loudly to each other with great regularity. I know this because I did not sleep all that well while they were calling.,"Pinefield Hut
