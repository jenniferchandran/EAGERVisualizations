At first it’s alluring and exciting and you spend a lot of time talking about it however the newness wears off and reality finally sets in and you may or may not like your previous decision. When this occurs you may come to your senses and decide doesn’t work as expected or that you may not have really needed all the bells and whistles that you spent your hard earned money on. Just like many of us I have purchased gear and then ultimately deciding against using it for one reason or another. I haven’t decided whether this addiction to buying gear is only a newbie phenomenon or whether everyone continually experiences the desire to purchase that perfect piece of equipment. Getting ready for a thru hike on the AT has been an interesting process. From past hiking and camping experience I know that there is no perfect rain gear and that sooner of later you will be wet either from the outside or inside. That being said I was looking for rain gear that would be adequate to the task. I first purchased a rain jacket and chaps from Sierra Designs I was thinking with the type of jacket material and the extra ventilation that would help to keep me drier inside when I did have to use rain gear. The jacket was extra long so that it covered the chaps which did help keep my lower body cooler and drier. The only draw back was that the jacket was easily penetrated by rain and you ended up get a very fine wetness coating the inside of the jacket and ultimately got you wet. The wetness was not from sweating on the inside but from leakage on the outside. So strike one with the first attempt at getting rain gear. Next I decided to use rain pants that I already owned but were just a little bit heavier. In turn however I needed to purchase a jacket and after much deliberation I decided on a Marmot rain jacket. The Marmot jacket worked well however I wish it was lighter and was more packable. As usual with gear folks I am currently considering purchasing a Z-packs rain jacket which is considerable lighter and packs smaller than the Marmot I currently own. The Z-packs rain jacket would also work well with my rain chaps since it is a longer jacket and cover the exposed area not covered by the Marmot jacket. While hiking I noticed a number of people with rain skirts and I think that would be a wonderful replacement for rain pants in the summer. As with all gear heads there are decisions, decisions, decisions. Fortunately the gear that I decide or not decide to use is not the critical factor on my reaching Katahdin.",,The Allure of Researching and Selecting Your Gear,"Mar 04, Fri",0
 ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522489,"Tweet?                ??????                 ?Self Doubt is a nagging mind cancer.I am normally a very positive and upbeat kind of person however recently I have struggled with self-doubt so real and that at times it is like a clanging gong between my ears that I can’t ignore. There will be days that I can shake it off however doubt returns and my brain keeps whispering to me you can’t do this.I want to hike the AT and I have wanted this for a long time I just don’t understand why I constantly keep trying to convince myself that I can’t do it. It seems like my nerves are just playing games with me to see if I am mentally strong enough for this trip. I know that a part of completing the AT is obviously physical and according to Vince Lombardi “lack of conditioning will make cowards of us all” so the better the physical shape I am in the more likely that I am to be successful. The frustrating part of getting in shape is that for every two steps forward I take it seems like I then fall back three steps. This past summer after walking to get in shape I decided to add weight to my pack and on a simple hike in the woods I ended up pulling a muscle in my calf. This stupid injury set me back over a month and it stays in my mind that this injury could reoccur at any time and interfere with my dream. Right now I have a heel spur that is driving me nuts to the point that I haven’t been able to do much walking let alone hike. I tried to be positive with both of these set backs because I still have plenty of time to overcome them and get ready. I know overcoming obstacles is a huge part of completing the AT however I am not even on the trail yet. I have wonderful wife who I can talk to about anything and yet it is hard feeling like you can’t talk to her or anyone else about the hike (Besides other Hikers). I am sure that I have worn her down about my constant AT hike talk. My wife is super encouraging and supportive so fortunately that is one doubt I don’t have to deal with at all. To help deal with this self doubt I look for information or examples of positive mental preparation. Zach Davis, who thru hiked the AT, wrote “Appalachian Trials: The Psychological and Emotional Guide to Successfully Thru-Hiking The Appalachian Trail” and it is a very helpful book. Zach listed a number of ways to assist in the mental preparation necessary to complete the trail and his book is very useful. Zach also has a blog at www.appalachiantrials.comFor those of you reading this post I am asking for your help. I am looking for positive quotes, positive songs or other examples things that have kept you going when times are tough. I am going to use this information to help me through the rough times that come with any challenge.",,Self Doubt and Dealing with that Confidence Killer,"Mar 04, Fri",0
 ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522601,"In November of 2015 I attended Warren Doyle's Appalachian Trail Institute near Damascus, Va. This class was well worth the time and expense. At the class I found out that at least 75-80% of the people who start their Appalachian Trail thru-hike fail to accomplish their goal. Warren spent a lot of time trying to get us articulate why we wanted to hike the AT. If you don't truly know why you want to hike the trail then when you utimately end up facing mental and physical adversity you are more than likely going to give up. Most hikers who quit don't do so because they ran out of money, got seriously ill or injured. All the books I read said hikers quit because they were not realistically prepared for several challenges that are inherent in any long distance journey. Warren stressed that year after year, many hikers who stop prematurely had not truly prepared themselves mentally and emotionally for the psychological demands of the trail. During the ATI class I met other like minded people who were preparing to hike the AT. Already two people from that fall class have started hiking from Springer Mt. and having been with them during the class I know that they have what it takes to complete the trail.",,Appalachian Trial Institute ,"Mar 05, Sat",0
 ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522574,"It is getting close to the start time for my north bound Flip-Flop from Harpers Ferry and I want to do a short section hike which I will count as part of my thru hike. On March 24 I plan to hike from Front Royal to Harpers Ferry, which is approximately 54 miles, to see if my final preparations will work on my AT Thru hike. I plan on going home after the shake down hike and make any changes to gear and procedures prior to starting leaving Harpers Ferry April 18. I anticipate very few changes however I would rather do this shake down hike first so that once I start hiking I will hopefully minimize disruption. At this point I think that I have everything planned out for my hike however like most plans they fail and disappear when faced with the light of reality.","Front Royal

 ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523427,"March 22 I plan to drive to Franklin, N.C, which is over 7 hours from where I live to get fitted for trail runners. This may sound crazy to drive that far however I had been plagued by plantar fasciitis from Nov until Feb and I want good fitting shoes and inserts. I believe I have the issue under control since I have been going to physical therapy and doing stretches which seems to have fixed the problem. However I know good fitting shoes can make a difference while hiking and although I am happy with my Solomon trail runners I want to get a proper shoe fitting and I have heard that Outdoor 76 does a great job.    Starting March 24 I am going to do a shakedown hike from Front Royal to Harpers Ferry which is about 54 miles. Like many people I have checked my gear selection over and over again in an attempt to get my pack weight as low as comfortable. Right now with equipment, food and water my total pack weight is 34 pounds. I am doing this shakedown hike as a means to make any final adjustments before I do my flip-flop starting from Harpers Ferry April 17. I am hoping for a mixture of good and bad weather on my shakedown hike so I know how everything works under a variety of weather conditions. Counting down the days.","

 ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523630,"To correct a problem with plantar fasciitis I have been going to physical therapy for about 3 weeks and it has made a significant improvement. Along with physical therapy I have being doing stretches, icing the area, as well as getting a new shoe insert change. During one of the sessions the physical therapist made me a support out of leukotape and it worked for a while however after wearing it for about 5 days my foot got red and started itching. Today when I went to physical therapy I took my sock off and noticed that large areas of my foot callous were sloughing off. Funny things is my plantar fasciitis has improved and now the bottom of my foot is cracking open. One step forward. Two steps back..",,One step forward. Two steps backward.,"Mar 15, Tue",0
 ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525337,"Short AT shakedown hikeI had been planning for weeks to do a shakedown hike from Front Royal, Va. to Harpers Ferry which was roughly 54 miles by foot. My goal for the hike was to find out if what I carried in my pack was appropriate/adequate and to find out if I could physical deal with extended days of hiking. I started hiking from the Mountain Home Cabbin hostel Thursday on a beautiful sunny morning. The climb up from the hostel was roughly 825 ft over 3 miles and was very gentle. Last year when I was in shape the climb would not have been an issue however I was like a slug hiking up the hill. I found that I got winded easily, which was definitely annoying. While hiking I did on a number of occasions come across some very rocky uneven terrain that didn’t cause me any issue with my plantar fasciitis but did bother the left lateral side of left foot. The first thru hiker I met was a young man whose trail name was “Einstein” and had started from Springer Mt. Ga. in January. Later while stopping at a creek to get water I meet a another young man who was not only carrying his pack but also an additional pack on front of him. He said that he had gotten a trail name from Einstein and it was “THC”. He went on to explain that his trail name did not have anything to do with marijuana and that it related to his carrying two packs and the initials THC stood for Two Hump Camel. The reason that he was carrying two packs was that his girlfriend had injured her knee and he was helping her by carrying her pack. I confirmed something that I already knew which was that going up hill was hard on my stamina however going downhill was worse since it was hard on my knees and I was worried about having an injury. I stayed that night at the Jim and Molly Denton Shelter and I have come to realize that if a shelter was named after someone it was probably way better than average. When I arrived I was the only one there for quite a long time. The shelter was an exceptionally place and had a large porch with two Adirondack chairs, solar shower, piped spring water, privy, bear pole, cooking shelter with fire pit, tenting spaces as well as a horseshoe pit. I had the shelter to myself for a short period of time when another young couple showed up. His thru hike trail name was “Tinman” and his female friend who had no trail name yet and was only section hiking during her spring break. After I had set up my hammock and tarp as well as having cooked my dinner a group of boy scouts arrived which was both nice and annoying. I slept well that night and broke camp early to hike to the next shelter. Unfortunately the discomfort on the left lateral side of my foot got worse and when I crossed over a county ride which lead to Linden, Va. I decided to get off the trail. I had only hiked a total of 8 miles since Thursday which definitely was frustrating. My goal was to learn from my experience and I can honestly say that I learned enough to make it a worthwhile trip. I will list some of the things that I learned later and I do plan on going back to my jumping off point and finishing my section hike to Harpers Ferry.","Front Royal, Va

 ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525148,"Outdoor 76 has great customer service.I have been wanting to hike the AT for a long time and I have put a good bit of time and effort attempting to get ready to accomplish my goal. Last year I hiked and walked over 550 miles over the summer and into the fall. However in November I hit a brick wall when I developed plantar fasciitis in my left foot and could not even put any weight on my left foot. From November till February it was gradually getting better however in the back of my mind I kept worrying that the issue would rear its ugly head again. I made significant improvement when I started doing stretches everyday and going to physical therapy at Mountain River (great place for physical therapy) and working with Melissa. I still was concerned about the fasciitis returning and read an article on Appalachian Trials about the great shoe fitting service offered by Outdoor 76, an outfitter in Frankin, NC. I know that most people will think I am nuts however I drove almost 8 hours to Franklin NC to a proper shoe fitting and it was well worth the drive. When I arrived I spent about 2 hours with Rob (one of the owners) discussing my issues, the biomechanics of my feet, trying on shoes and finally getting fitted with a shoe and insert. Outdoor 76 has been in business if I remember correctly for over 6 years and in the process of developing their business they got advice from a retired pediatrist on how to fit shoes. My previous shoe experience has been you pick the shoe you like and then your are given the shoe in your size to try on however that is not what is done at Outdoor 76. Rob explained that shoes were made to fit the average persons feet and that not everyone had that average foot and I sure didn't. After spending about 2 hours and trying on shoes Rob asked if he could make adjustments to my current shoe which is a Solomon. This particularly shoe has a unique speed lace which was nice if you were wanting to put your shoe on quickly. The problem for me was that when I tightened the shoe to keep my heel in place the shoe string squeezed my toes making it uncomfortable. Rob finally changed out the shoe strings and restrung the shoe after making additional holes in the shoe to run the shoe strings thru. Rob also explained the advantage of getting the proper insole and when he was finished and tried on the shoe it felt wonderful with no issues. Rob had spent all that time and was ending up selling me shoe strings and an insoles. I did decide to buy another pair of Solomon like the ones I currently own however without the Gortex. I know I am rambling on about shoes however what I am really trying to say is that if you have feet issues and hike you really should take the time to drive to Franklin NC Outdoor 76 outfitters. Outdoor76.com As an added advantage they also sell craft beers in the store which unfortunately I didn't try any.",,Outdoor 76 has great customer service.,"Mar 28, Mon",0
