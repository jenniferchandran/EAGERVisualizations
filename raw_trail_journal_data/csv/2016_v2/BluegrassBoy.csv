BluegrassBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514026,"I've set a date and have started hiking to break down and build up my body. I'm a self confessed couch potato trying to get my life back. I have been reading books, magazines, websites and journals trying to get some knowledge for this adventure. I look forward to chatting with some of you soon.","

BluegrassBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514979,"I thought it was funny, that some people thought it was funny, that a short, fat, middle aged guy would want to hike the AT. Then I went shopping for some new hiking duds. Evidently hiking clothing manufacturers think its funny as well.I wear a 3X shirt and have a 48 inch waist. I can't find anything. I'm sure I'll lose some weight before I hit the AT but come on. Any one else have this issue??? I guess its jeans and cotton t shirts until then.",,working it out,"Oct 01, Thu",0
BluegrassBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515079,First I just wanted to say thanks to hoozurmama for the warm welcome and advice. Not sure how or if I can respond to guestroom entries directly. I'll look into that. So it's about 4:30 am and I'm sitting in my car outside of REI Cincinnati. They open at 8 am today for the members yard sale.I'm not first in line because I didn't stay put last night at 9 when the store closing. I've heard this sale is like black Friday on steroids. Hoping for some great deals on gear.,"

BluegrassBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515545,"so last week I went to the REI members only yardsale. It was my first experience at this so I'm sure I made some rookie mistakes. I did pick up a Osprey Atmos 65 pack. it said it was returned because the person didn't like the way it felt on his back. Score for me, pretty much a brand new pack for $100 off. Also got some Salomon & Oboz hiking shoes that were returned after being worn twice. Less than $20 each so no complaints there. Went out today & hiked about 6.5 miles with a small pack with water, snacks, & an extra pair of hiking shoes in the pack. Pretty flat ground and finished in about 2.5 hours. I'll get there, one step at a time.",,picked up a few things,"Oct 10, Sat",0
BluegrassBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517130,"Went out today to Red River Gorge in Eastern Kentucky. Hiked 2 trails. The first was Eye of the Needle stairway at Natural bridge state park. it was actually three trails that skept splitting up but lots of stairs. Stone stairs & wooden stairs to get to the top of Natural Bridge. The second was a 2 miles out and 2 miles back, out to Courthouse Rock. All I can say is it got my blood pumping. What a terrific day. I carried a small pack with about 10 pounds of photo gear and my tripod. Hope everyone is moving along with their plans. Just one foot in front of the other.","

BluegrassBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517495,I just got the news I need shoulder surgery. yay! I'll be having surgery next month to repair a tear where my bicep connects to the shoulder. Should be in a sling about 4-6 weeks then start rehab. hopefully I'll be able to get back to hiking around Feb - March. Better to get it fixed now than to have it screwed up on the trail. Keep on keepin' on.,"

BluegrassBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521840,"Well my shoulder surgery went well. I've gotten about 85% of my range of motion back at the 2 month mark. About another 3 weeks and I can start strength rehab. I'm hoping to get the clearance to start hiking with a small pack soon. Starting to shop for some of the large items I'll need. Things I've gotten so far are Black Diamond hiking poles, Jet Boil cooking system, Osprey Atmos 65 pack, Darn tough socks, sock liners, GSI pinnacle dualist cookset, and a few pairs of boots/shoes that I'm trying out. Just ready to get back out on some trails. Good luck and safe travels to everyone hitting the AT soon. I can't wait to follow along with your blogs!","Surgery

BluegrassBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522558,"I have decided to get back out on a trail tomorrow. Just a short 7 miler but don't want to put too much stress on my shoulder yet. Just taking water and a couple bars. Have to remind myself if I fall to twist to the right and stay away from my left shoulder.In other news, I think I have found my tent. The Big Agnes Rattlesnake 2 person. Most reviews are solid as far as the tent goes. Only dislikes I've seen have been about the Mountain glow system not charging phones well, etc. Anyone have experience with this one? I'm going to order it soon so any advice helps.Bluegrassboy","

BluegrassBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523844,I have an appointment with my doc on Tuesday to see if its ok to start putting weight on my shoulder. I'm hoping for the ok so I can get back to hiking with a pack. I really need to get back out on the trails. Less than a year to start time and I'm so anxious to go. Anyone else getting the fever?,"

BluegrassBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525005,Howdy everyone. My doctor gave me approval to get out hiking. I have to be careful with my left shoulder so slow and easy it is. Did a few miles at yahoo falls at Big South Fork. It felt real good and even after some steep steps I felt good enough to get out today for another 3.5 miles. A little sore but great otherwise.Question: I've read that Verizon is the way to for phone service. I've also heard Straight Talk uses Verizon towers. Has anyone used or heard of anyone using straight talk on the trail. Hate to get I to a 2 year contract for 6 months.Hope everyone is doing fine. Anyone as anxious as me?,"

BluegrassBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525538,Well I've gotten out again. I did 6.4 miles today around a local lake. It seemed like I was taking it easy but finished in 3 hours. I felt pretty good overall. Had some shoulder pain and got a small blister on a toe but no big deal. Looking forward to continuing this trend and adding to the mileage as I go. I hope everone is doing well. Won't be long now. I've got a feeling this next 11 months is going to fly by. At least I hope so. See y'all soon!,"

BluegrassBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537525,"Wow it has been awhile since I posted. Its been a busy few months since I've posted. in a nutshell fiances graduation trip, a sudden illness that lasted a couple weeks, and her family in town due to a health scare with her father. So for now, all clear. A few weeks ago I did a tough 7.5 miler with some good hills with 200-300ft ascents and 300-500 ft descents. its less than an hour away so nice place to go. Monday and today I did 7.5 on a local trail but no hills so I'm trying to work back into it. Just gotta keep on keepin' on. In other news I have gotten my tent, Big Agnes Rattlesnake SL2 and can't wait to try it out. I just ordered my Spot Gen 3 gps device. If you don't know what it is google it and check it out. Also through the 19th if you buy it from bass pro shop and activate it by the 30th you get a $75 mail in rebate. That's half off. I hope everyone else is doing well. Only about 8 months left. Looks like I'm shooting for February 25 or 26 start date. Anyone else? I'm also thinking about starting a vlog on youtube. If anyone is interested I can let you know when it is up and running. Goodnight my fellow future Thru Hikers!","home

BluegrassBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538989,"So I've upped my mileage a little to 8.5 today. I felt pretty good but tired when I was finished. I think it was more the 90+ heat index and high humidity more than the miles. I've been experimenting with stopping for 45 minutes at the halfway point and taking off my boots and socks to air out/dry out before starting back. So far I am liking the results. Feet are still a little sore but it is keeping the blisters from forming.After getting home I took a long shower, ate some dinner and just relaxed. I got to thinking and it popped in my head that on the trail there will be no long showers at the end of the day, there will not be a lot of relaxing because gear needs to be unpacked, tent set up, water gathered, etc. It occurred to me that the little things that we take for granted may be some of the biggest things we'll miss while on the trail.I can't wait for my week long trip and then month long trip in the coming months. How's everyone else doing??","Trails

BluegrassBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539280,"Well I pushed myself today. I hit my 4 mile mark at an hour and a half and decided to crank out another to hit 5 before I turned around. It seemed like a good idea at the time. Then the clouds and breeze moved out and sunshine and humidity moved in. My pace slowed down a bit and I ended up doing 10.27 in a little over 4 hours with three short breaks. I'm a little more sore than normal and I'm also starting to smell my pack. its not pretty. Any advice on cleaning packs? How often, what to use, etc. I know I should probably get used to it but if I have the opportunity to get some practice, why not?Hope everone is doing well and moving along.","

BluegrassBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541880,"So, I've decided on my dates for a 2 week prep hike for September. Ive had several places in mind but decided on heading to Amicalola Falls. I'm going to hike 12-14 days NOBO on the A.T. Seems like as good of a place as any. So now I'm 2 months away from actually hitting Springer Mountain. I'll see how I handle things taking it easy (I think) doing 6-8 miles a day. maybe a little more if I'm feeling good. I don't know if its a good idea or not but just feel the need to do it. When I get back I should know where I stand, with about 5 months to go. Anyone else thought about doing this?","

BluegrassBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549967,"I didn't have much time or signal to update so here is a quick rundown. I went down to Amicalola Falls on Sept 21st with a high school friend as a shakedown and then some. We skipped the approach trail due to water issues along the trail. So on Sept 22nd, late in the afternoon, we started our hike up Springer Mountain. On the way up we ran into Cee Bee, Willow, and their husbands. We chatted a bit and continued up Springer. At the top, I was just so happy to finally be there. The white blaze, the plaques, I was there.Sunshine and myself took some photos and started our hike back down and on to Stover Creek Shelter. It didn't seem like too bad of a hike but it did tire me out. I did have a hard time getting to sleep the first couple nights but it worked itself out.Over a couple days we leap frogged with quite a few hikers and met some really great people. Stayed at Gooch Mt shelter, Hawk Mt Shelter, Lance Creek campsite and an unmarked camp area after one extremely long day. Spent a couple nights at the Hiker Hostel and I can't say enough how great of a place that is. The hiking was strenuous. I always hear about Blood mountain being rough. It was, but Sassafras and Justus will beat you up as well. Other than one really persistent blister, I didn't have many issues. I would like to get my pack weight down. With 3 liters of water and 5 days of food it was at 44 pounds. Ended up at Unicoi Gap and was taking a night off in Helen when I got a call from my girlfriend that her father passed away. Packed it up and headed home the next morning. Hoping to get back and finish Georgia soon. I hope everyone is doing well and hope to see y'all on the trail.","Springer Mountain

BluegrassBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550366,"Tomorrow I will be heading back to Georgia, back to the trail. I have been home for almost 2 weeks and I am anxious. I feel a need to get back. Back to the mountains and all that comes with them. The rocks, the trees, the air, the pain, all of it. There is a deep seated desire within me now. Knowing every night when you lie down that you've earned every bit of sleep your body gets. The whole experience is life changing and other people don't understand, can't understand. Unless you've been there, experienced it, its just a hiking trip. Some excuse for you to escape life for awhile, a a way to run away from things. But no, I am not running away from things. I am running to them.","Hiker Hostel

BluegrassBoy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554667,"Wow,, it seems like forever since I've written. However, that is about to change. Finally I will be heading back to the trail. Picking up where I left off in Georgia in September, Unicoi Gap. I am anxious and I've been trying to sleep without my CPAP machine these last few nights. It really hasn't worked out to well. Having panic attacks because it feels like I'm choking. I know it isn't as bad as it feels but damn it freaks me out. Once I'm pushing miles up mountains I'll be so tired it should work itself out. I guess that's a good thing. I hope everyone is doing well and hope to see some of you on the trail.The biggest things I learned from my miles in Georgia in September and the Smokies in October are as follows; Uphill sucks, Don't store food in a box (mail drops) or a bag (pack) with laundry detergent ( it smells good but tastes like shit), oh speaking of shit  when using a chemical toilet near a trailhead give a little look inside first to check the depth speaking from firsthand experience splash back sucks. Snoring and farting happens in shelters and it sounds like a weird version of the Lone Ranger theme. The biggest thing is folks, crazy shit  is going to happen. The important thing is, I can do this.Good luck Class of 2017!!",,Almost time,"Feb 16, Thu",0
