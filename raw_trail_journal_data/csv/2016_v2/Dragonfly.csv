Dragonfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523827,"How I got my trail name and what it means about me:I have been asked, ""why the trail name Dragonfly?"" Well, I have had some time to write it all down, and I am going to share it with you all. A woman named Virginia, who is staff at Amicalola Falls Lodge, started talking to me and asked me why I was hiking the AT. I told her my entire story, and she listened very carefully. The next day, I walked in the lobby of lodge, and she called me into the gift shop. She handed me an envelope and said, ""Thank you for your service and for the reason you are hiking."" In the envelope a Dragonfly Trinket and a description of the Dragonfly, which seemingly fit for me.The Dragonfly symbolizes change and change in the perspective of self-realization; mental and emotional maturity and the understanding the deeper meaning of life. It accomplishes its objectives with utmost simplicity and effectiveness. Dragonfly exhibits iridescence both on its wings as well as its body. Different colors depending on the angle and polarization reflect from its body which almost create illusions and clear vision into the realities of its life which are symbolic of a sense of self-realization. The Dragonfly exhibits power, agility, and victory which is not useful unless you have happiness, speed, and purity. The Dragonfly’s iridescence shines with prosperity, harmony, and is considered a “good luck charm.” I am a Dragonfly, I have changed overtime and continued to change as I grow and discover my self-worth. I take on all types of challenges good, bad or indifferent and challenge myself to make change in people, places, and things. I envision a life of happiness, strength, solidity, and inspiration; not only within myself but for everything around me. My power is in my heart, soul, and mind; my agility is in my body; my victory is the accomplishment of change that I create. I want to make change by using the harmony in my voice and through my spirit and bring prosperity and good luck to everyone I continue to impact.","Approach

Dragonfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523829,I wish I would have just started at Springer Mountain in the first place! By the time I reached Springer I was beat! I knew I wanted to push on so I grabbed a bite to eat (a full bag of gummy worms and a full size Snickers bar mmmmmm) I treked on! I made walked almost 4 miles past Springer Shelter and found a beautiful spot next to a creek. The sounds were simply relaxing and with the rain hitting my tent made sleeping just as nice!,"Approach Trail

Dragonfly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523831,"Not much happened this day, I hiked and hiked and hiked. I was thinking to myself just keep hiking. I felt amazing and that I could just keep going. I really wanted a shower this night. I arrived at Gooch Gap just before sundown and called for a shuttle but no shuttles were available. (I didn't know about the 24 hour shuttles). 2 guys walked up to me on seperate occasions and said come on over have a beer. They were all awstruck when they saw I had on a kilt. I downed my gear and walked over by the camp fire. The only name I can remember from the group was a dude from Germany his trail name is Spike. Funny thing about Spike when he told us his last name it sounded like Boogie Board, so we all unanimously gave him a new trail name ""Boogie Board."" Had some great laughs and good conversation. They invited me to a St. Patricks Day party, but I need the rest have school work to complete. I will have many more days to have fun and enjoy the trail though!","Stream (Mile 3.4)
