I reached a little far today to get a burger in my gullet, and landed up staying in a cabin here at the resort. Camping nearby is not permitted, and once I stopped hiking, my feet were not going to start again. Oh, compliments of my new shoes, blisters. I haven't had a blister in 15 years.

I just want into hiking today. I started late, after 2 cackle berries sunnyside up, grits, bacon, and rye toast, but just couldn't get into high gear.
I'm meeting alot of NOBO hikers who I otherwise might not have met. I think that is the greatest benefit to this flip I'm doing. These introductions do take up some time, but there are some good folks out here I would like to hike with for a little while.
Stopped at another wayside for burgers. (Maybe this is why I couldn't find overdrive) I dined with Thor, who is from Ohio and now resides in Latvia. He and I met headed up to Mt Rogers. Good dude, sad that he is leaving the trail, but happy to know he is going to try and come back. Thanks for the brew, Thor!

So, into my camp last night walks a man at 9pm. He's loud and clamoring about. I call out, but no response. I don my shoes, climb out of the hammock, and make my way to his ""nesting area"" to inquire if he needs help. Really I just want him to be quiet. My ire is up, and all I can think is that this loud kid is being quite disrespectful. Well, it was an older fellow, who was clearly listening to his music too loud to be bothered by sleeping hikers. Age is no excuse for this behavior, but it's late and I'm tired. I tell him to use my bear bag line for his food, and I climb back in.
Morning comes, I awake early to an alarm as I want to get moving and put some real estate behind me before the afternoon heat slows me down. The old man was cowboy camping and is awake while I'm doing my thing. I'm still miffed, but am obliged to pass on the SNP closure area. As I begin to speak with him, he glances my way and smiles.
""Sir, please, do you understand there is a huge fire in the Shenandoah, the southern section is closed, and you must make your way into Waynesboro to learn of the routing/shuttling around it?""
""Oh yes, I hear Waynesboro is quite nice. Would you look at this sunrise!""
""No sir, I'm going to look at the sunrise. Do you understand about the fire and such?""
""I'm glad you agree, it's a beautiful thing these sunrises. Appreciate them, it means you've lived to see another day.""
What the shit!? Is this guy going to hike into a forest fire? I approach a little closer, so I can get a better assessment of his state.
""Sir, is everything ok, did you sleep well last night?""
""Oh, last night! Very sorry about that. Heck of a day yesterday, what with my hearing aid batteries going dim. I'm going into Waynesboro today, do you think the outfitter will have batteries?""
Knowing that the outfitter is somewhat coordinating the shuttles, and is the focal point for hikers looking for information on the fire on the park, I look at him, smile and nod yes.

I am running into more NOBOs whom I've hiked with weeks back. It's nice to see familiar faces, and they've all been quite encouraging. Urging me to catch them by Vermont. I'm not sure if it's in the cards, but it's always nice to know there are people ahead who will camp with me.

This climb is incredible. Huge boulders to surmount, it's quite remniscent of my southbound ascent to Dragon's Tooth. Plus, due to the decades of poisoning by the mill, there aren't any trees to obstruct my view. Well, to be clear, the mountain is no longer barren, it's designation as a Superfund site has led to a very long term reclamation and reforestation project. So, there are many trees, but none of them are taller than 12-15 feet. 
There is big upside to this. The famed American Chestnut has been reintroduced in this area, and because of the lack of forest choking out sunlight, these young trees are producing chestnuts. You're asking me, ""What about the blight!?"", and that's a very intelligent question. Apparently the trees do not become victims of the blight until they are late in their teens, in ""tree years"" that must be early adolescence. So we'll before they get a driver's license. Also, a group of arborists here in this srea is working with Penn St to grow and mature chestnut trees with some Chinese Chestnut DNA spliced in. The expectation is Sino-American hybrid will be impervious to the blight (which originated in China and was delivered to North America a century ago), and possibly bring our two countries closer together than ""ping pong diplomacy"" did. I'm hoping for both, expecting the former. So, if all works out, Bing's famed Christmas song will be en vogue again - in 200 years.
Weather drove me into the town of Wind Gap. I had a 16"" pizza, 4 beers, and 3 fountain cokes (no ice). Yet, I'm losing weight.

They don't have a grill, which is a slightly less bummer than their midday opening time. To top it off, the hotdog guy doesn't serve until 11:00. I'm on a mission now, so I'm going to walk the 2 miles to the nearest town. I'll be able to get a ride back up the hill, no problem.
Christ! The two taxi providers in this one horse town can't decide which one of them gets the horse for the day. They are both afraid of money, which is the most absurd business model I've seen. It's 85 degrees out, and I've a 2 mile road walk uphill. Trail by 1pm?
I'm at the top, drenched in sweat. The hotdogs stand is open, at least that's breaking my way. Three dogs, 2 Pepsi-Colas, and a bag of chips. Oh, and one of the fellas sitting at the only table (it's shaded by an umbrella) says to me, ""sorry bud, if I'd known you were coming up here I would've have stopped to give you a lift."" Judging by his lack of perspiration, he had probably only been there about 20 minutes. Which would have been about 4/5ths of a mile. Not quite enough for me to smash my pepsi on his forehead.
