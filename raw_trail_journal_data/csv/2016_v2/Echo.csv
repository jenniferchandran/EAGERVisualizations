Echo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520393,"This is my first entry and I'm writing it while I'm sitting at work literally watching the time tick away on my countdown tracker. I have 66 days 00 hours 31 minutes and 06 seconds left until I leave for Springer Mountain.I've been thinking about this thru-hike attempt since September 2014 and seriously planning it since December 2014. All the major planning and logistics are pretty much complete and now I'm just waiting for the time to pass and the smaller things to get finished. Adding entries to the journal is the first really public step I've taken to declare the hike. Of course I've told family and close friends, but now it's out there. It's unofficially official!Here's to time flying",,View Entry,"Jan 29, Fri",0
Echo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521941,"I've had several people tell me that the hardest part of a thru-hike is getting to the start. I'd have to say, even as someone that enjoys endurance events, that I'm finding this to be true. Logistically, this is probably the most difficult thing I've had to plan for. But I'm accustomed to the preparation, planning and training that always comes with big events, so I feel very comfortable with where things are and how they have gone for the last 1.5 years. 
Probably one of the most common questions I get asked, is how can I leave my family and go do this hike. I have three children, ages 9, 7 and 4....and I'm in my late 30s. My answer: my children are at an in between stage of life. They are not completely dependent on me any longer and they haven't gotten into school/athletic activities which require a 24 hour taxi service. Nor are they at a point where they need constant adult guidance to navigate that pre-teen and teen experience. That being said, it doesn't make it any easier. Fortunately, they will be able to stay with their dad for the time I'm on trail and my parents live locally and will be able to help.
I've been planning the hike for over 1.5 years and I've tried to keep the kids involved in that process. They have helped pick out gear, meal plan, gone on family hikes/camping trips, talks about different trails and what it means to thru-hike and even picked out trail names for themselves (Game Master, Burrito and Bunny). They have each made a personal replica ""flat stanley"" for me to take on the hike and we even have a calendar that we've been crossing days off till we all leave for Georgia.
They all have different opinions as to what thru-hiking means and what they think about me doing it but they are all excited about it. That's not to say that there hasn't been a few tears over me leaving but the excitement has outweighed the later thankfully. Burrito will be joining me for the approach trail and everyone will be at the top of Springer Mountain. At various points, each of them will get to visit me on the trail, at Harpers Ferry and then hopefully at Katahdin.
Most people have been very encouraging, very inquisitive and supportive. A few have seemed skeptical and even mentioned this as being a selfish act, and I completely agree. Making a decision like this, at my age, under my circumstances is a bit selfish. But what I hope to gain from this experience is not only fulfilling a personal goal but teaching my kids something. I'd like for them to know that it's okay for people to have big dreams. And big dreams and goals can be achieved at any point with desire, determination, dedication, planning and of course sacrifice. 
Do I think my approach is right? For my family, it's working. Do I understand how fortunate I am to have friends and family that will support me in my endeavor? Absolutely! And that's how I know that I won't be taking any of this opportunity for granted.
I'm ready for April",,View Entry,"Feb 20, Sat",0
Echo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522110,"It feels sometimes like I'm being tested on how badly I want to go on this hike, the last month has been one crazy thing after another! Between house, work, family and personal issues, I've only come to the conclusion that this hike is exactly where I need to be. If I could leave tomorrow, I would! I'm reading of everyone headed out on the Facebook groups and I'm so excited for everyone and equal parts excited and anxious for my departure coming in a few short weeks. Happy and safe travels everyone, see you all soon!",,View Entry,"Feb 29, Mon",0
