I have now accumulated enough socks to hike the AT several times over. The ping pong table has been re-purposed to stage my resupply ""stuff"".

Hershey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520600,"Exactly three weeks from the start date of the hike. Reservations for the train to Gainesville and the Hiker Hostel have been made. Some are resupply food has been packed. Mostly stuff to add some variety (spices) to what typically can be some very boring and repetitive foods. So while much of it may remain ramen noodles and mac-n-cheese, there will be some flavor variety along the way. I will likely be the only person on the AT eagerly awaiting has shipment of fufu. Fufu is a starch (plantain based). Water added to the fufu powder is kneaded into a dough and then dropped into boiling broth for very heavy dumplings. First experienced on a business trip to Ghana. Typically eaten with the fingers and typically not chewed. That's were I am breaking from tradition with a spoon and some chewing. These are like starchy sinkers that go into your gut for a sustained appetite suppression. May not be hungry for two days, but probably not.",,Food Variety - Any takers for fufu?,"Jan 31, Sun",0
Hershey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520855,"Preparations continue. It is surprising how much work goes into preparing for this endeavor. Modified an excel spreadsheet (AWOL's?) to look at 12 and 15 miles per day schedules. Starting Feb. 21, the 15 mpd hits Springer in mid to late July assuming NO zeros. The 15 mpd may be a push for me. The 12 mpd also assuming no zeros hits Springer in late August. That gets close to our daughter's wedding in September. Only rough estimates. Also understand the need to be flexible. May skip PA or more and complete later in the season. May flip flop in order to be able to complete the closer to home sections later. We'll see.The other issue this task revealed was the spacing of the mail drops. The original plan was based on getting new ATC guidebooks and maps. Most were about 150 miles apart. There were a couple that were much longer so added a couple more in case a re-supply is needed. Since also bought AWOL's maps 2016 just issued!) based some suggestions from folks below.Also want to thank some folks for sharing there wisdom and advice from their thru or long hikes. Sarah H.aka ""Waiting"", Amy's friends Jeremy and Chris. Also Bob Daniels. Thanks for your time and suggestions, They are much appreciated. What has struck me is the twist. Hollywood so often portrays to older sage giving advice to the younger upstart. NOT the case here. Here we have the older guy eagerly and seriously seeking wisdom from these experienced sages who are a generation younger. Thank you.   ","

Hershey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521411,"Despite weeks of planning, the last several days have been extremely busy pulling everything together. Finally, finally got the drop boxes all set up for Karen to ship at the appropriate time. Back and replacement gear is organized to some degree on the ping pong table. At 1:30 am made some waterproof (???) over-mitts from some Tyvek and seam sealed the stitching. I hope I never need them because that would mean very cold and wet conditions. The other water proof over-mitt option was just to use plastic grocery bags over the mitts with some rubber bands to hold them on. So these homemade Tyvek over-mitt are little step up from grocery bags but not much. One of the thing that got pushed back is writing these updates. The train leave Harrisburg for Philly at noon today Friday. Then from Philly arriving in Gainesville, Georgia at about 7:00 am Sat. Then the nice folks from the Hiker Hostel will take me to their place for the night, breakfast in the morning and a shuttle to almost the terminus of the AT on Springer Mountain.

Hershey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521425,"The gear adds up to about 33 pounds not including food and water. Two quarts of water is another four pounds and several days of food is several more pounds. It is more than I was hoping. Part of it is winter gear. Part of it is not knowing what I want to do without. Likely sending that ""stuff"" home soon. Hope to get that weight to less than 25 as the weather warms. Change out the pack, sleeping bag/quilt and winter coat.  The good news is the 15 pound weight loss since retiring. And there is plenty to spare in the coming months.",,Weigh In,"Feb 19, Fri",0
Hershey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521497,The train ride was good. The train was supposed to leave Philly at 3:55 and when I looked at my watch it was 3:55. Thought to myself this is impressive and I recalled all times the trains in Germany left at the scheduled minute. Well that schedule did not last too long. It was an hour late arriving in Gainesville GA. There Duffy picked me up and took me the Hiker Hostel. A very cool place that caters to hikers. In addition to the log lodge Josh has converted two shipping containers into places to stay. Very nice and used recycled materials like pallet to finish the interior. My two daughters arrived safely from TN and Pittsburgh and are staying in one of the shipping containers. Tyler our youngest daughters boyfriend is here and staying in one of guest rooms.

And I could tell that they thought that was a feeble answer to their question. Upon introductions In the bunk house at the Hiker Hostel I reconnected with someone I met last summer. Soarin' (sp?) Soarin' and his dog were hiking on the Horseshoe Trail in front of our house last summer while I was doing yard work. His dog's paw was sore, Soarin' had left his bandana about a quarter mile back and asked if I was retrieve it for him. He said he would be thru hiking the AT I'm 2016. I told him my plan was to hike it in 2017. The early retirement allowed the hike a year earlier. So what a surprise to meet each other again.

Hershey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521607,So it begins. Both daughters and ones boyfriend were able to meet at the Hiker Hostel on Sat. night. We shared two nice meals. Some good BBQ and some good German. On Sunday morning they followed the van to near the top of Springer.They successfully navigated 13 miles of winding and muddy dirt road in a 2002 Buick Century. That in itself was an accomplishment. The four of us hiked the 0.9 miles to the top where the famous plaque stands. We all then backtracked and said our goodbyes in the parking lot. My hike continued to just past Hawk Mnt Shelter. I chose to hammock rather than squeeze into the shelter. While it did rain much of the night I was comfortable and slept well. My decision to hammock appears to be a wise one. I met a couple folks who stayed in the shelter. The first was Chainsaw. Apparently he was given that name during an earlier Thru Hike attempt due to his snoring. The others in the shelter confirm (regretfully) that he still snores very loudly.,"Day 1

The tarp flapped much of the night and the wind rocked me awake. Awoke however to a beautiful sunrise. The highlight was some trees at the top of the mountain, perfectly white against a pure blue sky.

Then after groceries while waiting for the shuttle to take me back to the trail, two gentlemen approached me. They did not appear to be too well off. But the one gentleman seeing me and perhaps thinking I was homeless set a nickel on my knee. I politely declined his offer. Three things to consider. a) God bless this guy who did not appear to have much to give. There are great people in this world. b) How important appearances are and how easily I forgot what I looked like between the outfitter and the grocery store. c) How absolutely scruffy I look!","

For many years I have had this fascination with the thru hiking culture. For the short amount of time I was able to experience the Trail, it met and exceeded my expectations. The support network that immediately surrounds he trail is amazing. A young college student turning her truck around to pick up a scruffy hitch hiker. Kind hostel owners accommodating hikers needs. Trail angels dispensing hot coffee, orange juice, fruit and cookies at a road crossing. The hiker community that is this incredible cross section of individuals from very diverse backgrounds; a coal miner, retired military, high school and college students, a retired air traffic controller all with this common interest in thru hiking the AT. All collectively supporting each other with words and advice. And to those who send me encouraging notes; ""thank you"".

He was under care for melanoma. My hope was this loss of balance was the result of medications and not a symptom of the disease.

But that is a hike that I very much prefer NOT to repeat. And while it does not look like it on the map, I was just shy of 10% (210 mile) when I got off the Trail. I really do not want to give up those miles, so a new and more complicated hike is planned. Tomorrow, taking a train to NYC and then to the AT around Pawling NY near the Connecticut border and hike to Kathadin. Then a flip flop back to Pawling and hiking south ending in mid November.","

My attitude is not what it had been three months ago. Then there are dozens of other differences. There is so much more wildlife. Sarah and I were thrilled to see a toad. In the past six days I've seen more toads, garter snakes and chipmunk than my previous 59 years combined. Stepped on one garter snake or at least, it move right before my boot hit the ground (I did not see it early enough to avoid it). While my boot was on the ground it did not move but as soon as I lifted my boot it quickly continued on its way. The birds are out. Saw a scarlet tanager. Beautiful. Countless songs fill the air in the mornings and through the day as well. There are also the woodpeckers pounding on the most audio resonating wood they can find at 5:30 in the morning. They're not looking for food. They're intent on making loud noise. It is interesting to hear the different tones that are available for them to play. The weather has been warm with no rain yet as opposed to the cold, rain and some snow of the first part of the hike. Consuming huge quantities of water.

Now it is how I get into towns. So I picked a town for a resupply because it had two taxi services. Don't want to or need to hitch hike. Right? Call the first number and ask for a ride intotown and the guy says ""Everybody just hitch hikes into town from the Trail."" I want to give the guy some business and nothing. The other number is disconnected. So run across the road thinking ""I'm going to give this 15 min. and then I'll just call the taxi guy back and ask again. I waited less than one minute.

I've since managed by threading the belt webbing through a buckle. It takes a little longer but still secures the pack on my hips. Well that left the belt really long and hanging around my knee. So I shortened the belt. Simple!!! Unfortunately I cut the belt too short not leaving enough length to thread it through the buckle without a bit of struggling. Solution???

Hershey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542213,"My attempt to thru hike the AT in one season has concluded at 626 of the 2189 miles. There are a variety of reasons. My left knee is injured. While I believe that several days rest is all that is needs to recover, a serious knee brace was purchased to get me through the Presidential Range of the White Mountains. My time window was rapidly closing and I needed to average more miles per day than I had been averaging recently. The remaining Whites of southern Maine were going to slow me down for a number of days. I feel satisfied that I was able to experience what it is like to thru hike the AT.  The AT thru hiking community is like no other, a micro society or culture in some ways. In many respects it is a tight community. They are not day hikers. They are not weekend hiker. They are not section hikers. They are thru hikers and are rightfully very proud of that fact. They possess both the physical and mental strength to persevere through months of continual challenges. I liken it is some ways to professional athletes requiring both physical and mental stamina to endure hiking 10 to 25 miles daily in all weather and under all kinds of trail conditions. Tight also because thru hiker are able to keep track of where their fellow thru hikers are on the Trail and they look after each other.  Yet it is a loose community. Groups of hikers change and morph as they progress along the way. Partners can come and go as so many things about the Trail change. On my last day on the Trail I was with two guys (Hootie and Big O) who I first met in NC. Hikers who you have not seen for days or weeks reappear and acquaintances are renewed. Even in Grand Central Station in NYC I was shocked when Polar Bear who I first met in Georgia came up to me and we both were headed back to the Trail. And then sometimes paths never cross again. You can never tell.  And then there is the trail magic. Out of the pure goodness of peoples hearts they go out of their way to help other people and seemingly always at their own expense. From leaving water and sodas at the most needed locations. (One day I would have had to attempt to filter absolute swamp water if it had not been for some perfectly located trail magic.) To Carl setting up tables with great spreads of food and drinks. To those willing to pick up smelly sweaty hikers along the road and drop them off at their destination. To Ibex providing food, drink and clothes. Tears well up in my eyes as I consider all the wonderful people who silently support the AT hiking community. May God bless you all. Thanks go to my wife for her understanding and respecting my dream of an AT thru hike. She understood how important it was to me and granted me this opportunity (even missing our 30 wedding anniversary!). Thanks to my friends and family who have supported me through this effort in words of support, interest and in prayer. And thanks to the thru hikers who allowed me to enter into their world for a period of time, share in a bit of their experience. Prior to this hike I was in awe and viewed thru hikers with considerable admiration. After my attempt, my respect and admiration has greatly increased. My sincerest congratulations to all the single season thru hikers for 2016!",,Conclusion,"Jul 13, Wed",0
