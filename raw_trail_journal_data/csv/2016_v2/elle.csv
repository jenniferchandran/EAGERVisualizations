elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503958,"For as long as I can remember, I've been fascinated by the Appalachian Trail. I learned the basics of hiking and camping while I was growing up in New England and each time I'd hit the trails I'd wonder what it would be like to be in the woods for five or six months, carrying my life on my back. As a kid, I grabbed every opportunity possible to string multiple backpacking days together - it didn't matter if it was through church camp, girl scouts, or tagging along with my friends' families or my brother's boy scout troop. I just wanted to be outside. I'd even build ramshackle shelters in the woods behind our house and sleep under pine boughs in a bulky three season sleeping bag every time my mom would allow me to stay out all night (provided that I promised to take ample food with me and not eat any poisonous plants). Those nights made me anxious to grow up and finally be old enough to backpack long distances on my own and let me tell you, I couldn't wait!Of course, life doesn't always turn out the way you think it will when you're ten years old in the forests of New Hampshire. I did grow up, but I went to college for engineering and got a good, steady job instead of becoming a hiker bum with a sprinter van. I ended up with three televisions and a big house far away from any mountains or forests. I slowly forgot about my dreams and I committed myself to my new, fancy, comfortable life.And then, everything changed (and I mean EVERYTHING).So here I am, feeling as if I'm poised on the brink of an enormous chance to change my life and go off to chase dreams and goals and happiness. And so it's time to absolutely, publicly, irrevocably declare that I'm going to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail. It's going to take me five (ish) months. It's going to be hard. It's going to hurt, and be cold and wet and tiring. I'm going to be doing it alone, because I don't have any friends who are in similar circumstances who have the ability to just pick up and leave and start something crazy. And, honestly, I don't know anyone who has this same scary-powerful urge to take on an enormous challenge and make a statement - draw a metaphorical line in the sand with that first step off Springer mountain - saying ""This is my moment to start over. This is the new me. This is my new life.""What better way to walk away from an unhealthy past than to literally walk the 2,200+ miles of the Appalachian Trail? And concurrently, I'll be achieving a lifelong dream. I know it's crazy, but I'm certain that it's what I need to do. so here we go!! Time to plan and shop for gear and figure out how I'm going to make this awesome goal a reality.",,I might be crazy...,"Jul 03, Fri",0
elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503970,"I'm an engineer by education and profession. I like to have all the data before making a big decision. I've been trained to be level-headed and careful in all aspects of my life and I'm usually fairly cautious when it comes to determining which option is the best.That being said, I totally bought two different cooking setups yesterday because I'm quite seriously OBSESSED with little lightweight adorable thru-hike cookware options. I can't deal with how freaking cute the tiny, efficient water-boiling stoves are, and have you SEEN the little 100g fuel canisters!?!?? Come on now. I couldn't resist.To be fair, I did a huge amount of research before my sorta-splurge buying spree. I looked at alcohol stoves, canister, hyper-efficient water boiling, solid fuel, homemade, etc etc etc. And I decided on canister because I like that the litter canisters are self-contained and the systems (Jetboil, MSR, Snow Peak) met my weight vs. convenience/comfort standards. I bought both an MSR Pocket Rocket with Titan kettle (.83L capacity) and a Jetboil Minimo (1L capacity). The Minimo was really the 'splurge' purchase since I only intended to get the Pocket Rocket to allow me to simulate cooking camp dinners to test recipes and flavors. But, I couldn't resist the dang purple plaid Minimo cozy available on Amazon (for cheaper than retail!), and I knew I'd use it on short hikes even if it ended up to be too heavy for the AT itself.So that's the story of how I ended up with both a Pocket Rocket and a Minimo. I'm definitely lucky to have the financial durability to buy two whole cooksets just to test out and find my favorite!! I have the MSR here at home already and the Minimo is on its way from Amazon. I plan to start cooking up dinners with Knorr's sides and trying out different meats (I got some SPAM already!!) to see what I'm comfortable eating on a regular basis and to get myself used to the canister cooking times and methods. I'll do this for all of my gear... eventually camping out in the yard during the work week with my full gear set to try to get an idea of how my daily camp routines will go, and then taking everything out hiking on the weekends to test shoes, clothes, pack weight, etc. See? Told you I'm an engineer at heart!",,I heart cooking setups,"Jul 04, Sat",0
elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503961,"I was pretty nervous about telling my parents about my crazy plan to hike the AT sometime in the next two years. It could have ended up being a big fight trying to convince them that it's something I need to do for myself, even though it sounds unusual and dangerous. I had everything ready... I would explain about all the research that I've done already, that I planned to hike northbound to ensure that I stayed near group of people in case of danger on the trail, whether from nature or ill-intentioned people, and that I had calculated that the costs would be easily withstood by my bank account even if I needed to quit my job to guarantee the ability to finish.And it went so much better than I expected!!! My parents are totally on board with the plan and I'm even more excited now that I have my two biggest supporters and best friends behind me as I plan this undertaking. Hooray for awesome family!",,Telling my parents,"Jul 05, Sun",0
elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503971,"So I tried to cook my first dinner over an MSR Pocket Rocket in a Titan kettle today.I failed (sorta).Here's what happened....1. I unpacked the Pocket Rocket and screwed it into the Snow Peak 100g fuel canister. It scared me pretty bad with the whoooooooshshhhhh noise that it makes when you are stupid and leave the valve open while screwing the Pocket Rocket onto the canister. I got all nervous and took it apart until I realized that I just needed to turn the little handle to 'off"" position before putting the parts together. It didn't scare me after that!2. I tried to look up different recipes online to figure out exactly how much water to add. I don't have a pot cozy yet (it's just a Titan kettle at this point) so I figured I'd need to boil/simmer for a while longer in order to actually cook the food. More on this later..3. I chose to put in about a cup and a quarter (1.25C) of water into the pot. Then I assembled the stove (no jump scares!) and lit it. HOLY MOSES IT'S LOUD! I was surprised by how loud the flame was inside my kitchen. I guess I'd read a few comments mentioning how people chose alcohol stoves or Esbit stoves for the volume difference, but I'd never realized that it would be such high volume. Oh well! I don't mind if it's only for a few minutes a day. 4. The water boiled pretty fast - I swear it was less than two minutes - and I dumped in my chosen side (the Knorr creamy garlic shells). Everything looked like it was going great until the pasta started boiling again and the water got all frothy and bubbled and starting POURING OVER THE SIDE OF THE POT. It went all over my countertop, on the Pocket Rocket, on the canister... everywhere. I'm lucky it didn't burn me or get on my computer! I lost quite a bit of moisture/flavored water but I decided to forge ahead and cover the pot and let it sit for a few minutes in the hopes that it was still hot enough and had enough water to cook the pasta.5. Long story short - wrong decision. I had to add more water and bring the pot back up to simmer (this time I turned the Pocket Rocket down so it wouldn't boil over)6. I let it ""simmer"" for about two minutes, then turned the stove off and allowed the pasta to sit and cool down slightly (uncovered). I chopped up some spam into chunks and added it to the pasta to warm up. I was inspired by the ""creamy chicken blt skillet"" recipe on the back of the Knorr packet. 7. I got too excited and tried to eat the pasta before it was cooled down enough. I burned my mouth. ouch.8. I finally was able to eat the pasta/spam combination. It was salty. And actually pretty good.Final Review: I am terrible at cooking over the Pocket Rocket. I know it was my very first time cooking with such a small stove setup but it was a little bit disheartening. I made a huge mess and had to re-boil/re-heat the whole dish after my mishap, but I think the 1.25C of water was the right choice and would have worked perfectly if I had stopped it from boiling over. The portion was pretty hefty and I liked the spam in it for protein and flavor. I think once I get the hang of cooking it will be a good dish.",,My first attempt at lightweight cooking,"Jul 06, Mon",0
elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/504320,"I've been thinking a lot lately about what to do with my job/career when I go off to hike the AT. I'm fortunate enough to be in a place where the financial aspect of taking unpaid time off for five months isn't really a problem, but I do worry a little bit about how this hike will affect my career. My whole life was dedicated to doing extremely well in school, getting a good STEM degree from a highly-ranked university, and then getting into a career that paid good money at a stable company. I managed to achieve all of those things!! But now this big awesome life goal of mine has me thinking... do I want to stay at this company? It's really, really huge. Like, the biggest consumer goods company there is. I like my job well enough, but I really don't like where I live and due to some previous things in my life, I really don't trust a lot of the people I work with. I'll never feel like I'm part of the work 'family' - and it makes me think that it would be a great idea to just quit and start over somewhere new. I'd LOVE to live in Colorado or Wyoming!! My work history and skills/background would definitely make it easy to find a position at another company, so I got that going for me, which is nice My real concern was that I recently transferred locations with my company and I was worried that if I left my job before working a year in this location that I'd have to pay back all the financial relocation help that they'd given me. Yikes! It's not a small amount of money!! Butttt.... today I found out that there's no ""time requirement"" or anything of the sort that would tie me to this job for 'x' months or years!!! Of course, I don't want to be a terrible employee and quit just after they pay a ton of cash to get me to a new location (to be fair, I didn't WANT to move, but it's a long story and became necessary) and I do care about the company and my current projects, so at the very least I'll work up until I leave to do final preparations for my hike. Whether I fully quit or just take a sabbatical is up in the air, but it'll probably depend on a few things, like whether I start to really enjoy my job here, whether I get a different job with a different company that would let me start in October next year, or if I just get fed up with the whole thing and 'run away to the woods' for five months and leave my life after the AT up in the air. I wonder what other hikers do with their careers/jobs?",,Figuring out my work/career stuff,"Jul 07, Tue",0
elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/504625,"I've read a lot of trail journals and am following a few hikers going through this year and almost all of them say something at some point about how exciting it is when they get guestbook entries and I have to say - I GET IT NOW! A few wonderful souls have written in mine already and my heart is so full just seeing that I'm making connections with people who share this AT experience, even so many months out from my start date. It's so exciting to think about starting this hike and meeting real people along the way who I can actually get to know! I love everyone already Back to trail planning: my original start date (April 10th) is starting to seem a little bit too late. I know it's quite a bit colder and the weather is worse when you start in March, but if I can hike even half the days between March 16th and April 10th (based on weather, etc) then I'll have given myself a very decent head start and it will make me less anxious about taking zero or nero days later in the hike. I wonder if anyone has done an analysis about the average finish date for people starting in April vs. people starting in March? Do the April-ers always finish earlier? Or do they both finish around the same time because of zero days or short hike days due to weather, or something? I'd love to see a chart of that stuff. Yikes, I think my data-nerdiness is showing! I guess in the end it doesn't make too much difference - I just want to make sure to start when there will be other hikers around if I want them to be. As stupid as it might sound, I'm a little concerned about hiking solo and being female on the trail. I know it's dumb and ""bad stuff"" happening on the AT is super duper rare, but it's something that I'll probably worry about until I actually get out there on the trail and see for myself that everything is fine. Lots of ladies successfully thru-hike solo and I'm just going to add my name to the list!! Gosh, I'm already dreaming about Katahdin!I've hiked enough in my life to know what's what - lots of New Hampshire and Maine hiking, which I hear is some of the most difficult on the trail - so I'm really excited to see how my body handles the new geography of the southern end of the AT. I'm absolutely not making any hiking goals that revolve around speed or distance but it would be pretty neat if I feel comfortable with long days early in my trek!!To my new journal friends: how much did weather factor into your start date decisions? Any opinions on March 16th vs April 10th?",,Trail friendliness is real! + start date concerns,"Jul 10, Fri",0
elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505258,"I sleep cold. It's a fact. I don't know if it's a result of me being female, being of fairly lanky build, or because my body hates me and refuses to properly regulate temperature, but I sleep cold. I can have my house set at 72F and I'll still wrap up in a sheet and down comforter and full pajamas. sometimes I wake up a little bit sweaty but more often than not I still feel chilly if a foot accidentally pokes out of the covers.I'm sure you all know how this relates to my newest concern - staying warm while sleeping on the trail! I've read SO MANY THINGS about sleeping. I've researched tents vs. hammocks, down vs. synthetic, quilts vs. bags. I'm not scared of the cold, but I want to makes sure I'm properly prepared. For me, that probably means a 20deg down bag (I'm thinking Feathered Friends Egret Nano, in 5'9"" - it's only 31oz!) with a silk liner (I hear the 6oz Sea-to-Summit one is pretty good?). I'll wear lots of my clothes and a balaclava and sleep on a pad (Thermorest Prolite Plus, in small?). I'll make sure to dry out as much as possible and try to get into the bag before it gets very dark and the temps start to drop, and I'll be careful to keep a good air pocket around me to hold the heat close.But IN WHAT TYPE OF SHELTER DO I PUT ALL THIS STUFF? Do I go with what I ""know"" and get a backpacking tent like the Big Agnes Fly Creek UL1 or UL2? Do I go for the ultralight/ultraminimalist TarpTent? or do I try out hammock camping? I've never slept in a hammock in my life... i've slept in many tents. some were pitched in very poor spots but I slept alright, some were pitched well and I slept awfully. I've never been cold in a tent because I try very hard to surround myself with very warm things, but I'm really, really worried that I'd be cold in a hammock. All that cold air below my butt, just making my back/side cold? People bring underquilts, I know, but by the time you add up that weight why wouldn't you just bring a tent? Not to mention, I'm afraid of not finding good places to tie a hammock when I want to sleep, and I'm not familiar with tarp pitching - so a tent rain fly would be a LOT easier based on what I know.I think I'd be more comfortable long-term in a hammock (maybe) but I know for a fact that I can sleep well on floors/ground without a problem as that's all I've ever done while out backpacking. Recently, I finished reading Certain's journal entries and to be honest, her enthusiastic endorsement of hammocking really does make me want to investigate it (along with my concern that there will be SO MANY PEOPLE EVERYWHERE that I will want to just go into the woods and hide from them in the trees). I wish I had more real-life backpacking friends so I could test out different gear before committing to something. First world problems I guess, right!?",,Comfortable sleeping,"Jul 14, Tue",0
elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507401,"So I went to the west side of Mexico for work last week and wasn't really able to update on my journal at all. It was hot. As in, ""102 deg by 11am"", hot. I spent the days working ridiculously hard on some validations, spent the evenings eating the biggest and most delicious steaks I've ever had, and the nights working on my gear spreadsheet while lounging on my hotel bed. It was exhausting but pretty awesome, plus it was a work trip so all my food was free! I love it when I don't have to pay grocery bills because I get free food. I bet I'll be even more excited on the trail when I get free things to munch on!Speaking of the trail, I ordered my sleeping bag!! I picked the Egret Ultralight 20deg down-filled one from Feathered Friends - it's only 28oz! That's a teeny tiny 1.8lbs! I did pay a bit more to get the one that is a few ounces lighter (the Egret Nano is the very-slightly-heavier version). Also, the Egret Nano/UL is the 'women's style' version of their super popular Hummingbird Nano/UL style. It has more room in the hips/torso area and I'm a side sleeper, so I need that extra width for my arms to spread out and brace my weight against the ground. I did think about just getting a Hummingbird but the lengths are kind of awkward for my height - I'm about 5'7"" and I wanted a bag that was closer to my normal height than a man's 6' bag. I hope that I'm not cutting it too close by getting a 5'9"" bag!! Has anyone ever slept in a bag that almost perfectly matched their height? Do you feel comfortable or do you wish you had more room to stretch out? This is concerning me way too much, I think.I'm so excited for it to get here and to be able to test it out. I did a lot of research about which kind to get and all the reviews for Feathered Friends bags mentioned how awesome the company is and how wonderfully durable the bags are. I hope I get the same experience! (link to bags: http://featheredfriends.com/down-sleeping-bags.html)Other than that, I'm working on making a decision on tent vs hammock (and subsequently, which to get). I'd really like to get an Osprey Exos 58 pack (I'm a small, so it's only 40oz/2.5lbs) but I want to make sure that I have my 'big gear' together first so I can take it all to REI and test out packs with the real weight and my real gear volume. I'm extremely (unreasonably?) concerned that the Exos 58 won't fit all my gear and will break because I stuff too much into it. Then again, that must be a silly worry because most of my gear is very light (if not UL) and I'm purposely choosing items with small volume and tiny weight. I just want to be able to have my real tent, sleeping bag, cooking setup, and some of my clothes to be in my possession so I can simulate packing it when I test it out. And SHOES. Ahhhhh I'm so nervous about shoes. I wear New Balance shoes in 'real life' and have never had a problem with them causing blisters, so maybe New Balance trail runners would be the best choice? Or should I test out Merrells? And what about camp shoes!? Crocs are so heavy (and I don't even own a pair anyway) but I don't like wearing sandals. Maybe super-ultralight running shoes will be the right choice, like those Saucony Hattori Minimalist ones that have such cute colors! But the websites that sell the Saucony shoes all say they run really small and nobody seems to be carrying large enough sizes that could fit me.

I'm a secret member of the spelling police (a.k.a the pedant club).And I get irrationally irritated when people write that they are experiencing ""chaffing"", are ""chaffed"", or that hiking+sweat makes them ""chaff"".Dear fellow hikers who also sometimes get raw, uncomfortable patches of skin caused by excess moisture and friction - this is called chafing.  It has only one f (""chay-fing""). Not chaffing, with two f's (that'd be ""chaff-ing"")To be fair, chaff actually IS a word. It refers to husks of corn or seeds, chopped hay/straw, or worthless trash-type things. It does not mean awfully painful skin irritation, though.

elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507780,"It seems like I've now entered into a stage of research where I stumble upon a 'bad' story of a lost, injured, or otherwise unfortunate hiker every time I google around for gear reviews or thru-hiker blogs. Today, I learned about Gerry 'Inchworm' Largay and the confusing (and unimaginably sad) circumstances surrounding her disappearance on the Maine portion of the trail two years ago. Strangely enough, I was reading an article about the events when a friend of mine called to say that he was watching a television documentary about the same thing, at the exact same time. Spooky!Honestly, I was only mildly upset with what I read - she was hiking at non-peak time (I get the impression that she was a flip-flopper), her husband didn't seem too concerned about looking for her when she didn't show up at the pre-appointed time (... strange. I'd be very nervous, especially as it was raining and they had consistently met at almost every road crossing as she hiked from Harper's Ferry - she was hiking with heavy help from him), and nothing was ever found in the massive search for her (no body, no gear, no scrap of evidence of any kind. that's so improbable that it's basically impossible)I ended up personally concluding that she was either abducted or purposely left the trail and stayed under the radar. Side note and October update: her remains seem to have been found and indicate that she got lost offtrail and perished.My crazy theories are hogwash. Rest in peace, Inchworm.. Having also watched far too many episodes of 'Murder She Wrote', 'Columbo', and 'Perry Mason', I additionally concluded that her husband was responsible or knows where she is. Mystery solved!!...My friend, on the other hand, is not-so-quietly panicking about my safety and asking me to promise that I won't randomly disappear. I'm really so grateful to have people in my life who are wonderful enough to care about my wellbeing and to voice their concerns about my plans for a solo hike while being a fairly young female person. I'm also incredibly grateful that none of these concerned people have tried to stop me from actually doing the hike, including my panicky friend. It's the best feeling in the world to know that I have people surrounding me who care about me and are willing to support me on this adventure even when they think it's crazy and don't understand why I need to do it so badly. I'm a lucky person and I know it! I'll just have to make sure that I follow through on my promise to update an online journal for everyone at home to follow and to check in through phone calls and messages at every town possible. I hope cell service isn't too spotty and that I can continue to reassure everyone that I'm alive and still walking. I wonder if it's worth the weight to invest in a gps messenger?Anyway, the moral of my big rambling post is that i think i'll be just fine, safety-wise, on this hike. especially considering that there will be epic amount of people out hiking the season after 'A Walk in the Woods' comes out in theaters.

elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508453,"I went out of state all weekend to ride four-wheelers and get muddy at a huge dirt park a few hours away. We brought a bunch of campers and big pickup trucks and huge coolers of food and beverages and trailers full of loud, fast machines. It was awesome and hilarious fun.My friends and I call this ""camping"".But, I couldn't help but think that it's nowhere close to what I think of when I hear ""camping"". I think of single-person tents and backpacks stuffed with essentials and little lightweight stoves and trekking poles and absolutely no motorized vehicles. I've mentioned to a few people that i'm going to be backpacking for 5-6 months next year and the response is overwhelmingly ""You're going to live in the woods for half a year!? Where will you sleep? What will you eat!?"" I get the sense that most people think of camping in terms of fifth wheel trailers and coolers and big, cleared out spaces in the woods. I tried to explain that I'd be sleeping in a sleeping bag in a tent - yes, one that I pitch myself every day and carry from place to place. I tried to explain that I'd be carrying the type of food to which you only need to add hot water in order to eat - no, I won't be carrying a charcoal grill. Some people are really concerned about my safety, trying to convince me to get concealed carry permits for each area of the AT and lug around a pistol and ammunition. I try to appease those friends by saying I'm considering taking a small can of bear spray with me (but really, I doubt I'd even take that along). And I know they are just asking because they've never been backpacking and most have never heard of the AT and thru-hiking and they are worried about me - so I am patient and I try to answer everyone's questions. But really, I get asked ""Why!?"" more than anything. People want to know why I'd choose to do this crazy thing. And for most people, I can't really articulate a satisfying answer. I want to do it because I've always wanted to do it. It's a stupid, circular answer. Hiking those 2,200+ miles is this big, huge, difficult, time-consuming thing, and it will change everything. I've always known that, which is why I never attempted it before now. I was too busy working on my life - in school, then working on my career, then settling everything and making plans so I'd be comfortable... and it was never the right time to just get up and live in the woods for a while. But it's the right time, finally! I guess a better answer is ""I want to do it because I've always wanted to do it, and I have the perfect opportunity now"" Does anyone else have a better reason for hiking?In OTHER, VERY EXCITING NEWS: my sleeping bag arrived!! I shook it out and put it on my bed and snuggled into it immediately! And it's super comfy! And it has so much ROOM! And it's so, so, so warm... kinda too warm for my 73 degree house and my leggings and sweatshirt that I was wearing at the time. but I'm so happy with it - that it's not purple or pink, that it's the right size for me, that it arrived already and that it's all fluffy and new and begging me to haul it from Georgia to Maine.

elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508885,"There's a single REI within any sort of reasonable (less than 2 hours) driving distance from my house. I love going there. I touch the sleeping bags, I caress the cooksets, I fawn over Patagonia nano-puff hoodies, I crawl inside the pitched tents, and I load and wear different packs around the store and act like it's all normal. I'm often still in my work clothes, so that means a dress, or a skirt, or fancy business pants and blouses. I get asked, ""Do you need help?"" once every 1.256 minutes (not necessarily a bad thing - yay helpful REI people!). Usually I get flustered and startled because I was lost in thought about the merits and demerits of adjustable trekking poles, or something equally obscure. While in a dress and heels.

Might as well get 10% back and enjoy the great customer service from REI before and during my hike! Hooray for good companies.With my shiny new member card in hand, I bought a tent and a sleeping pad. I haven't quite decided between hammocking and tenting as a long term shelter solution, but I know that I'll start with a tent in March. If I choose to switch to a hammock when it warms up, that'll be awesome, but my first few weeks will be tenting (and, I assume, my last few weeks in NH/ME). I'm really worried about being cold! And I love the 'home space' that tents create. In any case, I settled on a Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2 (for the space) and a small Thermorest Prolite Plus (I'm almost shorter than the regular anyway). I'm very happy with both! I did wear a loaded Osprey Exos 58 (small) around the store for about an hour and a half but I didn't pull the trigger. I have a really short torso. almost comically short. I'm tall for a woman - between 5'7"" and 5'8"" - but my torso is on the cusp of extra small in packs.

I'm happy to be so much closer to my office (a 2hr commute is the worst, let me tell you!), but I'm sad to leave my house and my friends, and moving just sucks in general. Most of my boxes are unpacked and lots of the big stuff is put away, and my pet tarantula is happily settled and nesting again, but the apartment is still soooo messy and I feel like I don't have room to breathe, let alone spread out my growing gear pile and prep for a hike. So, in an effort to continue to make progress on my planning while simultaneously hiding from my explosion of moving detritus, I've been researching health insurance options. I'm too old to be on my parents' insurance, I don't have a spouse or significant other who can cover me with theirs, and I won't get any employment benefits since I'll be a jobless hobo. I know there are some companies that provide individual health insurance but I have NO idea how to go about choosing one. Some of the ones that pop up in Google searches look... shady. Then there is COBRA coverage, and other disaster-type stuff, but it's hundreds of dollars per month!! I read this, too, http://www.whiteblaze.net/forum/showthread.php/18278-Health-Insurance-while-Thru-hiking but I can't tell if it's still applicable since it's from 2008. Are other hikers on government health insurance? Medicaid? Does that apply to people who quit their cushy consumer goods tech jobs on purpose and aren't disabled or otherwise disadvantaged? Should I put out a Craigslist ad asking for someone with sweet benefits to marry me for 6 months so I can leech coverage from them? (please remember that last part is a joke. I'm no Craigslist-order bride). Sounds like more research is in order on the healthcare front....",,(F)unemployment - 190ish days and counting,"Aug 24, Mon",0
elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512122,"A hiker named Red Panda (www.trailjournals.com/dtb) summited Katahdin over the weekend. I've been following her journal for ages and reading her summit post made me a little bit sad that I won't have her hiking stories to read every few days. She and I are close in age and I feel like her experiences on the trail are probably similar to what I'll be going through next year. I'm a lot taller than she is, though, so hopefully I'll have a far easier time climbing on rocks and fording rivers!! (she complains a lot about her short legs  )Another thing that stuck out to me while reading Red Panda's journal (and others) is that this hiking season seemed very WET. Red Panda and the Aussie Legs (https://aussielegs.wordpress.com/) talk about being soaked constantly. I guess I did notice that it rained a lot this summer but for some reason it never hit me that it would be raining just that much on the trail, too. I don't usually mind rain or being wet in general, but the thought of 5 months of damp socks and dripping shoes isn't exactly pleasant. I'll probably be heading over to REI after work today to check out some poles and I think I'll try on some jackets and rain gear while i'm out there. Maybe it would make sense to do a wet shakedown hike in the next few weeks while it's still hiking season weather. I really wish that I lived close to the actual AT so I could hike on the trail itself to test gear, but I guess I'll have to make do with the few small parks out here. I tend to read women's trail journals rather than those written by men, both because women are usually more detailed in their descriptions of the days, and because female-specific challenges are just more interesting to me (duh). I love that Red Panda openly talks about her self-consciousness about weight gain and how she looks on the trail. She's obviously much more concerned with the actual hike but it's nice to know that I won't be the only hiker lady who will sometimes wish that I looked good while I hike. I'm a little bit frustrated with my less-than-ideal diet lately and my serious lack of regular exercise. My muscle tone is suffering from it and I feel unattractive in my own skin  I went swimming in a friend's pond a little while ago with my hilarious crew of guy friends... they don't care about stripping to swimsuits and jumping in, but I definitely paused and had to work up my courage to get in my bikini and join the party. I'm sure that they don't judge me based on ten measly extra pounds but it did make me wonder about all the activities on the trail when someone might see me in skivvies (bathing, changing, wringing out wet clothes, etc?) and how I can be better prepared and less self-conscious about my body. I hate that we, as women, are so critical and uncomfortable about how we look, but knowing that it's stupid doesn't make me any less awkward about being in the equivalent of a bathing suit in public. Obviously it would be a great idea to get back in my workout routine and proper nutrition - good for my body image and good for my physical hike prep - and it will make me feel so much better to lose the stress weight from the past few months. I suppose I should be grateful that it's only ten stupid pounds!! Maybe I should look in the mirror every morning and tell myself that I'm an amazing smart strong hiking goddess who don't need to meet no ridiculous expectations of physical beauty to be happy? but I'm a bad liar, so I don't think I'll be saying that :PSO! I'm hoping my REI trip is fruitful and that I get some of my clothing chosen and added to my gear pile. My apartment is almost clean and there is plenty of room to spread out now - hooray for throwing away 30 trash bags of useless stuff! It felt so good. I still don't have a pack so I really want to bear down and make a decision soon.. got to take it out for some shakedown hikes before it gets too chilly, right!?I'm so proud of all the 2015 thru-hikers who are finishing now and I'm so excited for all of my fellow 2016 hikers and our prep stories so far.

elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512251,"I visited REI yesterday. I tried on my beloved Exos 58 again... and once again, it just didn't fit right. I think that I adore the IDEA of that pack. I love that it's only 2lb 10oz. I love that it comes in a black/green color scheme. I love that it has a 58 liter capacity. I love that it's popular for thru-hikers.But the Exos 58 is not the pack for me. It's uncomfortable on my frame and I can't get the straps cinched in a way that distributes the load properly. I'm sad to acknowledge that the 'ideal' pack isn't actually my ideal pack. I had to let it go. I slowly set it down and started trying on Gregory packs to try to find one that fit better. Like I've said before, I'm a size small (almost extra small) but I'm not a small person in general, so I want a sturdy pack that gives me adequate room while still fitting well to my short torso. Eventually I tried on the Gregory Deva, a (GASP!) WOMEN'S PACK!!. And it fit better than any of the unisex/men's packs I'd been testing.before I go any further, I have to say - I usually can't stand the idea of 'women's style' things. It always seems so disingenuous and patronizing.- ""Oh, you like to shoot trap? This gun is for women, see how it's PINK CAMO? So cute, right?""- ""A girl who rides a motorcycle? You need this purple helmet, it's for women, see, it totally different because it's purple!!""- ""Snowmobiling gear? We have some for women!! Our female-specific gear isn't as warm as the men's styles, and we don't have any in normal dark colors, but look how good your butt looks! And it comes with free pink shoelaces!""Those three things have seriously happened to me. There's no reason for a pink camo gun to be the ONLY CHOICE in the 'women's section' of a pro shop, or for a salesperson to try to tell me I need the purple helmet because it's for women (same damn helmet as the less-expensive black men's one!) and don't even get me started on the guy at the motorsports gear place who, despite me telling him the heat retention specs that I'm looking for in a new set of gear, brought out the 'slim fit ladies flare shell pants' that had NO INSULATION AT ALL. Because I'm slender and he decided that the appearance of my rear end would be more important to me than NOT GETTING FROSTBITE.Frustrating.So you can see why I might have been a little bit hesitant about trying on women's style packs. From what I could see, they just looked like the same packs as the men's, but in dumber colors (I do not want a pack that screams 'girl'. I do not know why I'm like this. Probably left over from my extreme tomboy phase). But I tried to be open minded after my sad failure with the Exos 58. And, I have to admit, I tried a few girl-packs on. And oh my gosh they are so comfortable! The Osprey Aura 65 felt like I was carrying nothing at all, even though I loaded it with 30lbs and walked around the store for ages. The Gregory Deva felt nice, but not quite as good as the Aura. The Osprey Ariel felt bulky and heavier, and I didn't think to try on anything from the REI brand.So now I'm trying to decide between the Osprey Aura 65 AG - which I tried on at the store and it felt great, or the Osprey Aura 50 AG - which is only available online and I'm slightly concerned will not have enough volume for a thru-hike. My gear is really compressible and small, because I'm trying to cross over to ultralight (or, kinda-ultralight. I love that Minimo), so I think I could fit everything in 50 liters... but do I want to be constantly working against my pack to cram everything inside? Is it better to get the 65 and maybe have some extra room sometimes? It's a half pound difference for those 15 liters of room. Is it worth it?At least I feel a bit closer to making a decision on my pack. I'd really like to get out there and start my trial hikes next week, so maybe it's time to bite the bullet and order the dang thing already. I have my cooking setup, tent, sleeping bag, and sleeping pad already and I could probably mimic my hiker clothing from what I already own. 181 days until my (f)unemployment begins!",,Packs!

elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512350,"I'm sure that there will be a lot of events between March and September next year that I won't be able to attend because I'll be out on the trail. I haven't really thought much about that aspect of the hike and I'm sure I'll have a lot to say about the topic when/if I start to feel sad about missing out on fun with my friends or family.But that isn't today! Lately I've been thinking a lot about the little everyday comforts and routines that I'll miss while ""homeless"" in the woods - and I thought I'd share why I'll miss some of the more unusual things.#1: Nail polish!I keep my nails (toes and fingers) painted nearly constantly. I have a bajillion discrete shades of polish and I love the routine of taking off a chipped manicure, choosing a new color, and carefully applying new coats for the next week. Plus it makes me feel put-together and is almost the only feminine/appearance thing that I do on a regular basis. I will miss my little bottles! My fingers will be so naked!#2: My loofah!Of course, everyone misses readily available hot showers and being clean every day. I know that I'll miss it too. But I think I'll especially miss my cheap plastic loofah when I get those infrequent and revered hiker showers - I feel so much cleaner when I can make a ton of soap suds and wash myself with that weird spongy ball of plastic curls. I'm getting the impression from other thru-hiker accounts that even just warm running water is heavenly, regardless of washcloth or even soap availability, so I'm sure I'll be okay... but dang, I like that little loofah.#3: My hair.This one is still up for debate - and may possibly end up as journal post topic of its own - but I am currently leaning toward rocking very short hair for my hike. I used to keep it in a short bob/pixie style but I grew it out over the past few years and today it's halfway down my back. While long, it's SO easy to throw it up in a ponytail and it's well-behaved enough that even when I wear it down I rarely blowdry or straighten it at all. I never use product. But long hair, especially mine, gets really, really greasy and kinda gross after more than two days without showering. I can tie it up and throw a bandanna on but it's still dirty and I think it would be very hard to keep clean while this long. If I cut my hair into a pixie I think it will be more manageable, But I will certainly miss the length!!#4: Internet! (or general connectivity)I'm not talking about Facebook (I'm not on it, anyway...) or other social media sites because I'm actually looking forward to being disconnected from all that noise, and of course I know that I'll miss be able to contact my friends whether it's text, mail, Snapchat, or phone calls. I'm talking about general internet availability to be able to update this journal, tell people that I'm still safe and moving forward, or to look up information about the next portion of the trail. I'm sure I'll be fine with my physical A.T. guide book, but sometimes I worry about being out in the woods with no way to contact anyone. Worst case scenarios get stuck in my head all the time!!#5: Normal feetI have slender feet, no problems, no corns or bunions or blisters or unusual calluses, cute toenail polish (see #1!), and I'm comfortable in shoes. They work great for walking and running and wearing high heels. I'm unreasonably frustrated that they'll be sacrificed over the course of this hike. What if they get wider and I have to buy new shoes!? I already have a ton of cute shoes! I don't want to get a new collection! but I will... if I have to... because the AT is more important than keeping my feet exactly the way they are. See? I'm so reasonable (ha ha ha.)And, of course, I'll miss all the normal stuff like burgers and fresh veggies and mattresses and blankets and driving 5 minutes to see friends and drinks that aren't water and I might even miss having a job, but that's all expected.

elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514663,"I'm down to 153 days of potential work time. One hundred and fifty three. There was a guy who ate Chipotle every day for 153 days (he's from Los Angeles... maybe people there really love chipotle?). There was a French lady who was held hostage in Yemen for 153 days, too. Other than those two things, 153 days seems like an arbitrary number in the world lately.But for me, today, 153 days is my max estimate until I'm free! It's the day that my apartment lease ends, and it's the last day that I would agree to work. It's February 29th (appropriate, right?) and since I have 3 weeks of vacation per calendar year at my job, I may not even work most of that January and February time. It would be so great to have a long weekend every weekend and go up north to ride snowmobiles!! That would be my ideal winter.My ""to-get"" gear list is shrinking by the day. I have my bag and pad, my tent, my pack (potentially!! I need to load it with food and water to make sure it's big enough), my puff jacket, and I chose my poles. I think I might buy a pair of Merrells and try them out this fall at various dirt parks, trails, and outdoor activities to see how they hold up to normal wear and tear. I currently wear New Balance shoes as 'everyday sneakers' - but they tend to fall apart more easily than I think the Merrells would. But I need to test! I better get my butt moving on gathering my remaining big items that need testing because the weather is getting colder and colder and winter is coming! (I don't watch Game of Thrones, but I did read ASOIF). I adore winter. It's my favorite season by far. Spring is wet and chilly, summer is hot and sweaty, fall is beautiful but always so busy with work and people crowding outside to cling to the last bits of 'outdoor weather' and complain about the falling temperatures, but winter... winter is snowy and quiet. Winter keeps many people inside but it's ideal for folks like me - those of us who love snowshoeing and snowmobiles and waking up to the world covered in white. We're people who like wearing warm layers and drinking hot chocolate and snuggling into blankets. We make snow angels and drive 6 hours every weekend to find the best sled trails and the most remote fresh powder. Winter is my jam. It's also the reason that I can't live in a southern state. I don't even want to live as far south as I am right now, and I think I'm technically still in 'the north'.After I finish the hike next year, I'm guessing that I'll be in a good place to start a new job in a state that I love. I think I've said this before, but I don't really have a 'home state' anymore - moving a few times as an adult made it difficult to get a sense of home from any one place. Colorado is my front-runner option, for the mountains and weather and technical industry. then maybe Wyoming as a second choice, since it's pretty similar. third might be Vermont/New Hampshire (though I guess I'd prefer NH since I grew up there). If I had to choose a fourth, it'd probably be Michigan or Wisconsin area - northern half, maybe even upper peninsula - depending on job availability. No matter where I end up, I know that it will be someplace with snow. And hopefully mountains. And even more hopefully, an awesome job. 153 days of 'real life' left.

I know the days are passing (my hike countdown app says I have only 131 days until my apartment lease runs out!) but i barely feel a change day-to-day. November is only a week and a half away but honestly I wouldn't bat an eye if I woke up tomorrow and my calendar assured me that it was still only July. To be fair, these weird lingering 70-degree temperatures do make it hard to believe that it's autumn already, but I think my sense of time is skewed because of more than just the weather. Everything feels like it's going so fast, but so slow at the same time. I have no idea how to explain it! I'm continually looking forward to February/March and the start of my adventure, but I'm also clinging to the remaining time I have left with friends here before I leave. I don't know where I'll be living in a year (hopefully the trail will help me decide where to go and what to do!) so it seems extra important to savor friendships and time with people now. I felt a bit like this between graduation from high school and the beginning of college - I wanted to spend every minute with my friends just enjoying New Hampshire before I left for a new state and a new college life and possibly never seeing them again. As it turns out, we all stayed great friends and I see them all the time, even ten years later and spread out across the country, but that summer in limbo felt similar to this pre-hike time. Does anyone else feel like that?To get back into active hike preparation I decided to plan a 'practice hike' during the second week of November. Because I live in a state with no mountains (well, it has hills that locals call ""mountains"", but this New England girl doesn't buy it for a second!) it won't be a true hike. Call it more of a... gear test? Basically, I'll go wander in the woods for a while and set up a campsite and check out sleeping bag warmth, cooking gear, pack weight, water purification, etc - all from the safety of a patch of trees near a friend's house. I hope it gets cold enough to really test my layering and gear choices. I do plan to try a few nights camping in snow cover so I know what to expect in terms of preventing damp gear and staying warm through below-freezing nights, but there won't be snow in my area until late December at the earliest.In other news, I have allergies. Every morning I wake up to plugged nostrils and annoying sniffling. I take the equivalent of Zyrtec when it gets too bad but it doesn't seem to be helping much lately. I wouldn't make a big deal about it except that I worry a bit about allergy attacks while out on the trail. It's easy enough to just blow my nose when I'm at home but there's no way that I want to be wasting precious toilet paper on boogers. Maybe i'll carry a bandanna specifically for clearing my nose and haul around allergy pills for when it's bad. The weird thing is, I don't tend to sneeze when I'm outside - only inside - so maybe it'll be a moot point. I suppose I could just be allergic to dust or perfumes that people use (I know I'm sensitive to scented stuff like detergent and candles). That would be the best case!

Short story even shorter, I like beer.So what does my affinity for beer have to do with meeting TrailJournalers in person? Well, let me explain!! (no, there is too much, let me sum up.) A few weeks ago I went to the annual Oktoberfest celebration in a small town near where I live and I ended up watching the parade and dancing to polka music like any good German girl would. However, just as the local lawnmower drill team was passing by (push mowers, not ride-on… I live in a weird place), I noticed a man wearing a screenprinted t-shirt with a photo on the back. A photo of group of people surrounding the famous Katahdin sign. I did a double-take and looked again and noticed an “AT” symbol above the photo. My brain started yelling at me that he MUST be a hiker!! I screwed up my courage and gave myself a pep talk and… silently followed him around for about 20 minutes before working up the chutzpah to ask him if his shirt was in honor of a thru-hike. And maybe, was it HIS thru-hike?? And then I apologized about 600 times for “being weird”. I know… I’m super awkward.AND IT WAS ROCKETMAN! of Rocketman and Princess fame! He had a TrailJournal that I kept up with this year! It’s here: www.trailjournals.com/Rocketman2015. He writes so well!! And he's done two thru-hikes! And he was so nice to deal with my fangirling and (probably stupid) questions and awkward conversation because I was so blown away that I actually met someone that I read about here! He gave me some great tips about pack weight and his experience with Lyme and water purification options and we talked about the virtues of slackpacking and he offered some advice about using your phone to track position relative to the trail. It was AMAZING and I told him that I’d comment on his journal so we could stay in contact but I’ve been too shy to actually do it yet. So Rocketman, if you’re reading this, you’re awesome and I’m so excited that we met!!!I'm sure that I'll meet many more internet-famous hikers in person at different places on and off-trail next year but I highly doubt that I'll ever get used to it.

Between my family, my friends, and the awesome hiker community, there's no way that I could ever feel unloved or unencouraged. Every person that I've shared my thru-hike dream with has been excited and positive about it (well, there's always a little bit of worrying there too, but that's just another bit of love). I'm super thankful to be so lucky and have the best 'home team' of all time.

And my home team set me up to be hiking in style!! I can't take anything heavy or bulky into the woods but I absolutely can take these adorable tokens that were given to me!!



This is a St. Christopher medallion (saint of travelers) and an engraved charm with a quote from Aristotle (""in all things of nature there is something of the marvelous"") from my Midwest group.



And from my mom and grandmother, a sewn-on flamingo charm that I will see every time I open my pack, to remind me that I'm loved and supported . We have a family bond around flamingos - trust me, it's awesome.


I'm so excited to be hiking with these bits of love attached to my pack and for all the other ""mementos"" inside. I leave for Georgia in the morning and I'm just a bundle of excited energy right now. I might have to go for an afternoon swim to burn some of this off... Or another practice ""hike/walk"" around the neighborhood with my loaded pack. The neighbors definitely thought I was odd for walking around like a pack mule yesterday! One guy asked if I was in the army and practicing for boot camp - my forest green pack DOES give off a military vibe, I suppose!

I don't think I stopped smiling (nervously) for hours.I mean, look at this excitement for my first day!Still excited, this time for strenuous trail conditions!Okay, time for some real talk. The Approach Trail was so hard, you guys. I was very glad when I finally reached the Springer summit after four and a half hours with a very full pack. I took a few mediocre pictures and headed down to the Springer Mountain Shelter, where I pitched my tent and cooked up some dinner. Then the best thing happened!! I heard my dad calling my name! He had driven around Springer to the north side parking area and hiked up for one last goodbye. It was awesome and I was so glad for the opportunity to see him one more time and show him my pitched tent and bits of gear all organized inside.And I'm so glad that I practiced pitching that tent so many times over the past few months, because my first night on the trail was WET!! It stormed from sundown through the morning, which meant I worried about splash-up all night and had to wrangle a soaked and muddy tent in the morning. I threw on my rain gear and tried to get everything packed as fast as possible (again, glad for all the practice!!) and headed down Springer. Thankfully the weather tapered off around midmorning and my boots were barely muddy. I only planned to head to the Hawk Mountain Shelter area since I want to keep my miles fairly low in the beginning. I'm concerned about blisters and injuries from pushing too hard, so 8 miles felt like enough for Day 1. And of course, I took a picture of my first white blaze of MANY. Keep 'em coming!Hawk Mountain campsite area is really nice and since there is a another chance of rain I'm planning to sleep in the shelter. Lots of awesome people here and lots of prospective thru-hikers! The legendary camraderie is already apparent and I love it.

My first trail magic!! And it's only Day 2 of my AT hike! ""Sticks"", a former thru hiker, was making hot dogs and had water and a trash bin! Let me tell you, that hot dog was magical on this damp, chilly day.

I don't know if I was just physically tired, intimidated by the huge climb ahead of me, or just plain hungry, but I felt like crud. However, since you can't camp between Jarrad Gap and Neels Gap in March without a bear canister, and it's March 15th, I'm between those sites, and I have no canister, I had no choice.
I made it over that damn mountain. And the views were so worth it.

Looking at that view, I could only think about how lucky I am to be experiencing this adventure. My sore muscles and heavy pack and tired feet will all get stronger, lighter, and more durable, but views like that will never get old. Georgia is HARD but it's a challenge in the best way. 
Plus, my amazing reward for booking it up and over Blood Mountain was a hot shower and fresh food from Mountain Crossings Outfitter at Neels Gap! I wolfed down an egg salad sandwich, a can of lemonade, and a can of fruit punch... and still went back for a cold meat sandwich and a Mountain Dew.

After six hours in this random field, the awesome fire crew offered to escort us through the fire zone and around the active burn area to get back on the AT and make it to the hostels that many of us had reserved for the night.Turns out, 'escorting around the active burn area' actually means 'run through fire in full backpacking gear'. See, by the time we had climbed to the ridge above the AT (intending to reconnect with the trail on the north side) the fire line had advanced and was right in our path!!

ARGHHI cheered up a minute when I realized I was at the top and would be going downhill for a while. Hooray easy!

It was the kind of hiking where you throw your poles ten feet below and then climb hand-over-hand (or slide/jump/scoot) down to them. Rinse and repeat. For hours.I did get to pass the 700 mark. It gave my spirits a small bump.Sidenote: lots of fellow hikers said they missed the marker. Sad!There was also very little water to be found today.

Early bedtime hit for most of us since we were exhausted and had a long way to hike tomorrow. However, good sleep wasn't in our future... Around 1:30am a group of two guys and a girl rolled in to the shelter and started talking ridiculously loudly with headlamps on full brightness and many beers in tow. Never a good sign... They continued to yell/talk for a while until those of us trying to sleep started to ask that they quiet down a bit... Which made one of them very angry (he was the drunkest). Drunk Jerk decided to talk even louder and insult all of us and brag about his ""36 mile day"" - I wholeheartedly believe that this man did not hike anywhere close to 36 miles. No way.

It doesn't explain what The General is, or where, or why it's in the guide. I assumed it was a special rock. It always is.I was unusually curious about this side trail (to a rock, probably) and the guys agreed to follow it and solve the mystery of The General. We walked for 15 minutes, which is half a mile in hiker time, which is FOREVER, and didn't see anything resembling a General. We didn't even see any big rocks!! Eventually we gave up and headed back to the trail to finish the day... defeated by the blue blazes and the mysterious General. It was sad.I'm not sure if I should spoil the mystery of what The General actually is - because I did find out the truth later from two hikers that have the ATC guide and managed to locate it - or if I should keep it a weird AT secret. I'll just tell you that it ISN'T a big rock, for once! And if you go searching for it down the blue blaze trail, take the left fork, not the right one. The day ended with TWO ticks. One on my thigh, possibly attached, and very small. I carefully extracted it with tweezers. The other was chillin' like a villain on my camp shoe and was a 'normal' sized one.

After a quick fuel-up, elle and I followed Conductor back on the trail. The plan was to go until I fell over and had to be choppered out. I figured about 2 miles. The day started out beautifully. Gently rolling hills and perfectly groomed trails passed over babbling brooks. I upped my estimate to 5 miles.

Babble-babble-babble
Around noon, we saw Conductor’s treble clef etched into the dirt just before we passed into Connecticut. A little further along, a huge tree (an oak, I think) some feet in diameter had fallen across the path. It was suspended about chin-high (I’m 6’6”). Of course I was stooped over and my head was down. The tree won the battle without even noticing me. Fortunately, it was just my head, so the chopper wasn't requested. The only lingering pain was due to elle’s laughing question, “How could you not see that gigantic tree?”. She’s always mean to me.

Apparently it’s one of the top ten AT privies, maybe top three. Somebody should let FoB W. PoT know about it, due to his expertise in those matters.

This sign means “Excellent Privy Ahead”. That text was once where the sign rotted away.
At this point, the AT realized a buffoon was on the trail (me), and ratcheted up the fun. As elle effortlessly scrambled up a seemingly endless pile of rocks, I muttered curses to myself and tried to emulate her. To the surprise of nobody, she opened a big lead on me. Each time I came to a fork in the trail, elle was there sitting on a rock. “I’ve only been here for a minute”, she lied. She assumed I would take the wrong fork, and walk into another oak if she wasn’t there to direct me.
After a particularly heinous descent, I cried to the trail that it had won. I wanted to dig a Water Buffalo sized cat-hole and climb in, since I felt exactly like that which true AT hikers deposit in cat-holes. I sat on a rock and told myself that my tiny baby daughter was kicking my butt. OK, I forgot the giant cat-hole and continued stumbling forward.

Some nice views down to the Housatonic River, though!
At one of those (not so much) devious forks, elle gave me some ibuprofen and energy chews. I felt like a new man, or at least less like an old slug. I came to a spot where I wasn’t sure which direction the trail went. One way was straight up some rocks, so I assumed that must be correct. No surprise, it was. At the top, I came across two resting day-hikers (smell like soap, elle tells me). They mentioned elle was watching to see if I made it up. I muttered that I wasn’t sure I did. Then I saw the descent rock scramble. Ugh. I managed to make it, and the day-hikers commented that I looked like I knew what I was doing. Whaaaaaat? I feared for the day-hikers' welfare.
A little while later, I found elle sitting by a stream. She was only there for a minute. Honest. She had good news and bad news; good - only 1.5 miles left; bad – still 1.5 miles left. I told her to never talk to me again. She laughed. She’s so mean to me. Somehow, in 1.5 miles, she got about a half hour ahead of me. I finally caught her, standing in the trail, chatting with Shoe. I kept going, but she flew past me anyway. Suddenly, I could see the halo of the Angel Flamingo illuminating the trail! Of course there was one last stupid rock scramble between me and freedom. Thank you, AT. You are nearly as mean to me as elle.

The plan was for elle to hike the five miles up and down Fuller Mt. and Caleb's Peak to River Road, where Water Buffalo would join her for the easy, flat river walk. Then we would say our goodbyes and head home.
Paraphrasing Burns, the best-laid plans of mice and men go oft awry. After some Keystone Kops Konfusion regarding the meeting location, we met elle on River Road. She was clearly in pain, and her face was wet, although not with sweat. Her foot had gotten caught in some rocks during the descent from Caleb's Peak, when she slipped and wrenched her knee. We suggested taking at least one more zero at home, and possibly obtain a medical opinion. elle thought she might be able to loosen up on the flat Housatonic River walk with Water Buffalo. We went with the experienced hiker's plan.

I hurt my knee on 7/4 as I descended from Caleb's Peak (those rocks are awfully steep and I got my foot stuck and slipped. It hurt so bad. I cried.). Luckily my parents were meeting me at the foot of the mountain so my Dad could hike another day with me - unfortunately my knee was so jacked up that I could barely handle the easy riverwalk miles.

I also wanted to let the morning sun dry my tent a bit since it rained lightly last night. Saving those ounces!The only other northbounder thrus at Seth Warner last night were a retired couple that I met quite a while ago (at Darlington Shelter, just before Duncannon, PA) and who I like very much. They are consistently strong hikers and this is actually their second thru hike attempt - I guess the first ended with an injury a few years ago. They're awesome!

I leapfrogged with my thruhiker friends for a while, then they blew me away on the descent into town.

My original mileage plan had me staying here tonight and heading into town on Saturday morning to meet up with Water Buffalo, but I did a few bigger mile days than I had planned and am ahead of schedule. I'm very happy that I didn't stay in this shelter or in the camping area. It's a pigsty!! Congdon is probably the dirtiest shelter that I've seen so far! I guess it's due to the fact that it's the second northbound shelter on the Long Trail and also only 4 miles south of a major road? In any case, there was trash and bits of discarded gear everywhere, holes in every part of the shelter floor, it hadn't been swept in ages (and I couldn't find a broom), and a very bold chipmunk was obviously living inside the shelter. It makes me sad to see campsites/shelters in poor condition. I ate my lunch snack and stretched my feet and continued on to VT 9. I had heard that it was a busy road and popular parking lot so we shouldn't have trouble getting a hitch into town. Well... it wasn't so easy. I stood out on the road, thumb on display, for about half an hour with no luck. I guess Vermont folks are busy getting places! No hard feelings here. Just as the three of us were about to give up and wait for the rumored free bus, a man approached us from the parking lot and asked if we were LT or AT hikers. Turns out, he hiked the LT and was willing to give us a ride if we could cram into his vehicle alongside his family! We happily made it work and all three of us got into town safely. The hotel that I had booked for Water Buffalo and I was SO FAR AWAY. I'd have never made it if I had to walk. Yikes.I'm lucky that those folks gave me a ride because immediately after I had showered and was getting ready to walk over to Hannaford to do resupply, it started pouring rain. I decided to wait for Water Buffalo to get here with a vehicle and do resupply then. I'm so glad that my dad is here! With my leg acting up and my motivation at a less-than-stellar level it feels great to be able to see some of my support team. He's going to slackpack me for the weekend to see if that helps my leg at all. Yes, I've decided to slackpack. No, I don't think it's cheating. My personal challenge is to hike the whole trail, not to hike it with a certain amount of weight on my back. I know there's a lot of debate about this issue in the hiker community but my opinion is simply HYOH. I have crazy amounts of respect for the folks who carry 30+lbs every day, but there are hikers who have 9lb base weight packs - that's ALL THEIR GEAR - and they don't count as slackpackers. So where's the line? My engineering brain decided that the line is completely personal... and mine includes slackpacking as 'legal'. Hooray!Ok, enough of the thru-hike purity debate crud.

After a night at home, I dropped elle on NH 25, where I met her yesterday, at the end of her hiking day. The plan was for me to drive around to the trailhead on High Street, while she did the short hike to meet me, and then hike together up Mount Moosilauke (pronounced Moose-ill-awk). People say the name is from the Algonquian words “moosi” (bald) and “auke” (place), since the summit is above the tree line.

We Granite Staters get right to the point. Manners are optional, I guess.
She zipped though the relatively flat 1.4 miles and almost beat me to the meeting point. I greased up with Deet (avoiding my eyes!), and we headed onward and upward. Naturally, elle gradually increased the distance between us. I thought the trail was pretty steep. I was wrong. Steep came later.

elle, moving just a bit faster than Water Buffalo (not steep yet?)
About a third of the way up the mountain, I heard elle say “Ow.” Then “OW!” Then “OW! OW! OW! #$^&%!!!” When I caught up to her, she said she thought a bee stung her foot. Due to my complete lack of medical training, I assumed she pulled a muscle, but it felt to her like a bee sting. We were at a small stream with a couple of pieces of lumber serving as a bridge. She sat down on the bridge and removed her shoe and sock. Yep, bee sting. Yep, directly on her Achilles tendon. We believe the bee's name was Paris.

Paris (the bee) wounded (elle's) Achilles with a poisoned arrow, all for the beauty of Helen (me???).
She soaked the spot on her Achilles in the cold stream for a few minutes. We looked in her sock to see if a stinger remained, but found nothing. I told her to put her foot back in the water for a few minutes, but she said, “No. Let’s get going.” “Up?” I wondered. “Yes, Dad. Up.” she confirmed. “Yay,” I pretended.
With elle hobbled by the vicious bee attack, and the steeper, rougher terrain, you’d think I would have no problem keeping up with her, right? You’d be wrong. She did stop every once in a while to make sure I hadn’t rolled back down to the bottom.

Hellllooooooo down there! (Note the ""groomed"" trail)
I lost sight of her, but I did get a bit of a bonus when I got to the steepest and rockiest parts. With the beautiful weather, there were some pretty views toward the southeast. I managed to avoid falling off of a boulder while I snapped a few pictures.

Starting to be worth the climb!
When I hit the flat part before the true summit, I found elle taking a siesta, sunning herself like a lizard on a flat rock. She awoke and served me lunch; a weird tuna and something or other, wrapped in a soft taco, and a Clif bar. I mean it seemed weird, but tasted good. Hiker food. Who knew?

I took so long to catch her, she fell asleep while waiting.
At this point, we saw small children and somewhat less than hiking-fit individuals headed for the summit. We realized there is access to the peak on the gravel Carriage Road coming up from the Moosilauke Ravine Lodge. Maybe it should have made the climb up the mountain seem cheaper, but it didn’t. It was, however a lot more populated than you might have expected.

Decidedly NOT thru-hikers. They told me they are in jail.
We finally got to the part of the trail where my true skills became paramount. That would be Dad skills. A sick, apparently somewhat demented adolescent moose was standing in the trail. Thru-hikers had been hearing about this “obstacle” for about two weeks, and elle had great trepidation regarding seeing this poor suffering creature. She got behind me, closed her eyes and held my hand before we got to the moose. The sides of the trail were lined with thick alpine brush, so bushwacking was not high on the list of options. When we got to it, the moose helpfully moved to the left side of the narrow trail, so we walked by, close enough to touch it. When elle was about at the moose’s head, it let out a mild moose-grunt. When she asked me later why the moose grunted, I speculated the moose was saying, “elle! I read your journal. How’s your face? Say hi to your mother for me.” That elicited a slight smile.
Moose update: Sadly, but mercifully, wildlife officers euthanized the poor moose two days after we passed by.

Post-moose, the path to the north summit was a nice walk. The weather was perfect, if slightly windy. There were dozens of sight-seers of all ages enjoying the wonderful vistas at the summit. We were happy to rejoin elle’s thru-hiking friends, Mishap and Blacksmith, and we met thru-hiker Flash52. Mishap, Blacksmith, and elle intended to continue north, down a treacherous descent, while Flash52, like many other NOBOs was doing Moosilauke in reverse.

I think I can see my house from here!
At this point, I departed from elle and her friends. I descended to the car the way I came up, while they continued northeast. On the steep, rock-strewn descent, I felt I was making excellent time, until a young man literally sprinted past me, flying down the mountain as if he had rockets strapped to his feet! I couldn’t have done anything like that 40 years ago, let alone today.

I caught Blacksmith and Mishap and we've decided to hike the Whites together, at least. So happy to be with my trail BBFLs!

Well, we got to the shelter at 2:30 with a 4 miles hike to the next shelter (over Kinsman!). At first, I didn't want to push on, but 2:30 is so early and I got bored quickly.

She hadn't been there more than five minutes when we (myself and my friends with a nearby camp, Tom and Terry) drove up. She and I unloaded much of our gear into Tom's truck and set out for South Arm Road. 8 miles!But first, let's take a selfieThe trail started off fairly flat with a soft, wide trail and eventually had some steep parts but I felt really good. I think I impressed Elle with how well I kept up with her. I even got mistaken for a thru-hiker (ha!!!) Overall it was not a terribly challenging mountain - just the right size to start with. In the blink of an eye (1.3 miles) we were at Hall Mountain Shelter for an early lunch, complete with an overly friendly chipmunk. Next was the descent into Sawyer Notch. I very quickly learned why REAL hikers like going up better than down. I'm not very good at going down. Terrible, actually, and I slipped on a moving rock (rocks aren't supposed to move!!) and fell pretty hard. I caught myself on a fairly pointed rock with my right knee. Minimal blood, but likely a nice purple bruise will ensue. That just validated my fear of climbing down rocks! Next up: Moody Mountain. We were warned with signs and by other southbound hikers, I mean SoBos (I’m slowly getting all the terminology) that Moody Mountain was very steep. It looked pretty steep in the guidebook too. I was nervous. Alas, when you keep your head down to keep from falling over all the trip hazards, you don't notice exactly how big it is! In fact, Moody was very manageable for this first time backpacker. I kept up with Elle (or at least she slowed down enough to let me think that) and made it to the top! We had a nice break and headed down to South Arm Road where my car was gloriously parked and waiting! Happy hiker ladies!Successful first day after 6.5 hours of hiking. We finished the day with Diesel and Cold Snap and I dropped them off at Glen Ellis Hostel in Andover before heading up to camp for wine, beer, dinner, a jump into lower Richardson Lake and a sunset boat ride with Tom and Clem the dog.

It was definitely longer than the (not so) Moody Mountain. But... definitely manageable. Helpful or annoying? You decide.2.8 miles later we hit the summit and had a snack break while soaking up the views. The next few hours were up/down/flat and really enjoyable hiking across the ridge to Bemis Mountain. However, it seemed like we kept hiking, and hiking, and hiking, and FINALLY started the ascent to Bemis. The trail was so pleasant (a.k.a. EASY) so I wasn't complaining. We did make it eventually and it seemed like a cakewalk compared to Old Blue. Then it was down-down-down (boo). Elle didn't appreciate when I started singing The Ring of Fire. I guess she has no sense of humor when it's ""serious hiking"" time. 
Down, down, down leads to water!
We did have a bit more up (yayy!) to Bemis Second Peak (... Okay, who does that??) and our next trail marker was Bemis Mountain Lean-to. “The plan” (I'm quickly learning that plans are always flexible on trail) was to stop at the Lean-to and assess weather and motivation. Then, after a break, we would decide if we could push on the 3.4 miles to Bemis Stream camping area. It was 4:30pm when we got to the lean-to. Another hiker (with two dogs) was there and we knew if we pushed on tonight we would only have a single measly mile left in the morning, so we didn't even stop. It wasn't raining (yet) but we knew it was coming so we booked it down to Bemis Stream through some beautiful rock slabs (though strangely zig-zagged) blueberry bushes and (my not so favorite) steep down-hill rock scrambles. At 2 miles out, it started a light sprinkle and we picked up the pace into “beat the rain” mode. No matter how far we hiked I continued to use the mantra “only 2 more miles” right up until we saw the tenting spots where we again met up with Diesel and Cold Snap.

But we made it to the GORGEOUS Height of Land where, again, my car was gloriously waiting.And this is where I leave Elle to continue her final miles to Katahdin!! 

After this short adventure with Elle I have come to two conclusions. 
1.) I have no desire to thru-hike the AT. 
2.) Elle is freaking amazing. Hiking the AT is like this: Get up. Strap 30+ lbs on your back. Do a triathlon in the morning. Lunch. Do a 2nd triathlon in the afternoon.

Being so close to the end somehow makes annoying trail even more annoying. Also thought by now that I'd be so happy to be almost finished that nothing would bother me, but yeah, not so much. Pointless hills are still really frustrating.I rocked the canoe ferry, though!But first, let me take a selfieCutest ferry ever.Then it was time for some yummy house-brewed beers at Northern Outdoors. A very sweet couple who were spending the day enjoying the river and trails nearby offered to drive us to the restaurant/resort and I loved spending time talking with them.

elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551551,"JETBOIL MINIMO Gear Review!Weight: 14.6oz (excludes stabilizer legs and fuel)Jetboil Minimo. I had the one with a purple plaid cozyI actually bought two canister cook systems before my hike. Canister systems use small metal canisters (duh) of fuel that you can buy at any outdoors shop and nearly any hostel/hiker place along the trail. Anyway, I bought an MSR Pocket Rocket and a Jetboil Minimo. They are two significantly different systems (minimalist vs. convenient, lightweight vs. fairly heavy, etc) and I wanted to try both and get familiar with using them before choosing one and heading to Springer. In the end, the convenience of the Minimo won out and I took that with me.First meal!!Pros:- Excellent available volume. It contains all water and food for any Knorr pasta/rice side or instant mashed potatoes package. One full package of pasta side or potatoes or dehydrated meal (like Mountain House or Good to Go) usually took about 2 cups of water and serves one hiker. The Minimo easily holds the water and pasta (it can hold a full liter) so it's very convenient. Maybe not great for multiple people but it was perfect for me. - Fast boil time It only took a bit more than a minute to heat water up to near-boiling, where I needed it for pasta, and less time if I had it on full blast and was just heating up water for potatoes. It has a very neat simmer control so you can heat up the water, add pasta, and lower the flame to simmer - this stops the pasta from boiling over and getting everything gross and messy. I mostly abandoned pasta by my third week on the trail in favor of easier instant mashed potatoes but not because of difficulty with the Jetboil Minimo. I just liked potatoes better and didn't want to spend a lot of time cooking.- ADORABLE and EASY I loved how cute my Minimo was. The purple plaid cozy! The easy cleanup! The one-click built-in starter! The wide mouth of the pot that allows you to eat easily from the pot! The all-in-one packing system that holds the fuel canister inside the pot and allows you to keep everything together! I just liked it all around.- Fuel efficiency My hiker friends and I had a small celebration on the day I ran out of fuel in my first canister. The Minimo was just crazily efficient and since I only used it once per day to get water hot enough to rehydrate potatoes or rice/pasta/noodles, one little 100g canister lasted FOREVER.Cons:- Weight... There's no way around it - the Minimo is heavier than other options. Yes, it comes with a cozy and a stand and is basically idiot-proof (important for me...) but all that convenience comes at a price. That price is weight. I saw many other stove options from alcohol (SUPER LIGHT) to Pocket Rockets (too unstable for me) but many, many other successful hikers carried Jetboils too. This isn't the choice for you if you are pinching ounces. - Hot weather use So, I sent my entire cook system home when summer hit. I only used it once per day for dinner and the last thing I wanted was warm food at the end of the hiking day when I was exhausted and sweaty and gross. I wanted popsicles or margaritas full of ice or cold soda, not piping hot pasta sides. I also don't mind eating Idahoan potato packages rehydrated with cold water. Adding all that together with the fact that I was cutting weight wherever possible in order to give my injured hip and knee the best chance of making it to Katahdin meant that my cook system was the weakest link. I absolutely loved having hot food to look forward to at the start of my hike when it was cold/snowy/constantly rainy (I hate you Virginia!!) and if I was to hike again I would still start with my Jetboil. It was just too much weight for too little return during summertime temperatures.Do I recommend this gear? YES. I loved it. It was a great choice for me for the convenience. I had no problems getting fuel whenever necessary (I usually carried one full backup canister anyway because I'm a Nervous Nellie) and the fact that it packs down into a self-contained and protected bundle was a huge plus for someone like me who packs very, very densely.Any questions!?

elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551641,"BIG AGNES FLY CREEK UL2 Gear Review!Weight: 35.4oz (includes all stakes)My Fly Creek pitched on Uncle Johnny's Nolichucky Hostel lawn in TNI think Big Agnes was probably the most popular type of tent on the trail. I saw ten year old models still perfectly fine and in use (Conductor has one!) and many of the 2014 and 2015 styles. In fact, at Overmountain Shelter - the giant barn with the beautiful view - there were eight Big Agnes tents pitched in a row on the hill. Hurrah for ""Team Big Agnes""!Pros:- Weight/Volume Ratio. The Fly Creek UL2 is marketed as a two person lightweight tent, hence the UltraLight2. I'd call it more of a ""one and a half""... or ""two if you really like each other"". Regardless, it's a tight fit for two hikers and their gear (I would know from experience!) but a perfect fit for one thru hiker and a pack. I could sit up inside it and move around with ease, and my pack fit perfectly at my feet sideways in the foot of the tent. I'm 5'8"" and honestly I thought the volume was more than enough. I would not have been as comfortable in a smaller ""coffin"" style one person tent. I liked being able to sit up and spread my gear around in the evenings. Plus, the whole tent is VERY light, even lighter if you ditch the 'emergency pole repair' thingie and two of the stakes, like I did.- Ease of Setup. The pole system is one Y-shaped piece and entirely collapsible. The tent itself has clips that are SO easy to snap onto the poles. It took me maybe ten minutes to set everything up every day once I got the hang of pitching the tent out taut to eliminate any sagging once it was pitched up. Some people did mention that they thought it was difficult to get the floor of the tent perfectly square but I found that staking out the corners of the limp tent before adding the poles (vs. putting in the poles first and attempting to square the bottom of a three dimensional structure) was much easier and gave me a consistently even pitch. Also, don't forget to tie out your fly! It takes a little while to get a feel for the perfect tension but it's definitely necessary for wind/snow/rain/etc. Practice!!Just look at that pitch!- Pitch Anywhere. This tent is (mostly) free-standing. I didn't think that a free-standing tent would be such a benefit until I ran into situations where the ground was hard/rocky or when my only good option was to pitch on top of a tent platform. It was a serious bonus to be able to throw my tent up and use my shoes or rocks to pitch out the front of my fly and not worry about staking the sides out because it already stood freely. Of course, the corners of the footbox need to be staked or tied out to get maximum volume but I just put my pack down there to push it out and had plenty of room. Stake-free setup isn't a good idea in rain though, because the fly isn't taut, so don't rely on it in inclement weather.Shoe and I with our matching tents, squeezed onto a single tent padCons:- 2015-Style Door Profile. This is a very specific complaint to the 2015 model of the Fly Creek UL2. The profile of the rain fly door is not ideal. Even when the tent and fly are both pitched out perfectly taut and everything is tied down and looks good, the fly door is weirdly tensioned and the seam pulls in a very awkward way. In fact, my rain fly seam seal started to separate a bit after about 4 months of use and would leak when it rained heavily. I went to REI to get it repaired and they simply exchanged it for the 2016 Fly Creek HV UL2 model! Bonus! HV is ""high volume"". I didn't notice a different in volume but the fly door profile is much improved and I didn't see any seam separation in the HV UL2. This seam seal leaking thing was the only downside I experienced and the tent held up EXCELLENTLY in rain, even heavy storms in exposed areas. I would not consider this minor leak 'problem' big enough of an issue to rule out this tent and I would have continued to happily use my Fly Creek UL2 if REI didn't repair or replace it.Do I recommend this gear? YES! A THOUSAND TIMES YES! It was perfect for me. I was happy every time I was set up and making dinner while those with tents requiring using their trekking poles as support or complicated maneuvers to get everything taut were still fussing with their gear. It was super light and wonderfully large and packed down into a small volume. I also never used a ground cloth (a piece of tarp-like material that goes underneath your tent for protection) and had no problems with punctures or wetness after rain. I was careful to choose sites with minimal rocks and roots and stayed out of depressions that could collect water so I don't know if the tent is extra-durable or if I was extra-vigilant  Many hikers used ground cloths but I saw it simply as extra weight. Be careful!Last picture of my cute tent, in the Hundred Mile Wilderness. This is the HV UL2, my replacement tent. It's pretty much the same thing as the other one.Any questions!?

elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551658,"THERM-A-REST PROLITE PLUS Gear Review!Weight: 16.0oz (I had size small)This is what the Prolite Plus looks like. It's a typical padOkay. So. Sleeping pads. You need them for comfort and warmth. But, of all of the gear that you will bring on the trail, your sleeping pad is the one piece that interacts most with other hikers. ""But elle, what could you possibly mean?"" you may be saying to yourself. Well, let me explain... not all sleeping pads are created equal. Some pads are squeaky, some are creaky, some take up lots of space in shelters, some need to be inflated again in the middle of the night because they lose air, and some are super loud when they deflate in the mornings. They make NOISE and noise is awful when other hikers are trying to sleep. Now I totally understand that cheaper ""plastic pool float"" style pads are the only solution for some hikers and I would never be rude to someone just because their style of sleeping pad is loud as hell, but I am very very glad that I chose a silent and appropriately-sized one and never woke anyone up.Pros:- It is SILENT. I think I explained this benefit pretty well in the introduction but I'm serious, you guys - loud, squeaky sleeping pads can be heard across campsites and through tent walls. I wore earplugs every night on the trail and I still avoided crowded camping areas because of the proliferation of creaky, plastic, pool floaty sleeping pads owned by people who never stay still while they sleep. THIS IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE THRU-HIKER SLEEPING PAD  (source)- Durable. I had the Prolite Plus. It's supposed to be more durable than the normal Prolite and all I can say is I slept on that thing every night, on all sorts of surfaces, and never had a problem. It's still in perfect shape and doesn't even smell bad.- Convenient. It inflates and deflates SUPER FAST! I know it says that it's self-inflating but I blew it up each night with a few breaths (remember, I had the small size) and I easily deflated it quietly in the mornings by rolling it up and compressing even further it once it was rolled up. Additionally, it rolls up and folds in half pretty easily (not as easily as the pool floaty pads, though! The Prolite walls are thick) so there's no need to carry it on the outside of your pack like the Z-Lite style that can only fold or roll up loosely.This is a Z-Lite- Comfortable. SO COMFY. I slept like a baby on my pad. It's squishy and soft and even though it looks thin, I never felt the ground underneath me. I didn't inflate it to the maximum because I liked it to have a little bit of ""squishy give"" to mimic a mattress (can't do that with a Z-Lite). Plus, I was very warm in the cold seasons because it gave me an excellent heat trapping air-filled barrier between my butt and the earth. I tried out some other peoples' pads and never found one that I liked more than my own. Plus, uh, did I mention that it's silent?Cons:- Short? (I did this on purpose, though.) I'm 5'8"". I bought the SMALL Prolite Plus to save weight. It's only 47 inches long so (if you do the math) that means that it is significantly shorter than me. I slept on my side, usually with my knees bent and legs pulled up, and I slept with my head on a small inflatable pillow or on my clothing bag. With my pack at the bottom of my tent (I used it as a foot rest/elevator) and my pillow at the top, I didn't want or need any more sleeping pad length. If I had brought a full length Prolite or a longer style of pad it may not have fit as perfectly inside my tent. Of course, if you are taller or require more padding underneath your head or feet then this is not an option for you. - Can only use for sleeping. Some people with Z-Lite style foam closed-cell mattresses ended up cutting off one portion and using it for a seat during meals or break times. Others just put their pads on the ground and sat on them. The Prolite Plus can't be put in the dirt or on rocks/roots/etc unless you want a dirty and probably punctured sleeping pad. It's hard to clean if it gets dirty (no simple wipedown like the plastic or foam styles) and stays damp for a long time if it gets wet, but I thought it was easy to avoid both of those things. - Weight. It's twice as heavy as the NeoAir (Therm-A-Rest's pool-floaty-style offering) and a few ounces heavier than the previously mentioned Z-Lite. It's not an ultralite option.Do I recommend this gear? Yes, but only if you sleep like me. I don't like noise when I sleep. I don't need a full length pad and I'm not super tall to begin with. I needed extra heat-trapping ability because I ""sleep cold"" (I don't make a lot of my own heat and I get cold easily). I wanted it to be durable and I didn't care about having a portable 'seat' or being able to sleep on literal dirt piles. I don't think that this is the perfect gear choice for everyone but it worked very well for me and I'd choose it again.

I changed from the 65L to the 50-liter size at that point because my 65L was too large for me and my gear was sliding around in the extra volume. I wasn't using the vertical front pockets or a lot of the top space in the pack itself. To be totally honest, I had shed enough gear and learned to pack so densely that I didn't even need fifty liters, but I was nervous (AS USUAL) that I would need the extra volume in an emergency. GIANT overfilled 65L pack on my first day in GA!VERY reasonable 50L pack on my final day in MaineI've been doing pro and con lists for each item so far but I want to say something very important before I start the more 'technical' portion of this entry: packs are incredibly, INCREDIBLY personal items of gear.. Your pack is the #1 thing, other than possibly shoes, that will affect how you feel almost every moment of the day. Your pack should be comfortable, durable, appropriately sized, a reasonable weight, and make carrying it as easy as possible. You'll be shoving 20% of your body weight into a sack on your back and carrying it up and down mountains for many months... it's never going to be easy but the right pack can make it more bearable. I chose to carry the Osprey Atmos - a men's style pack - because after trying on many styles and sizes it was the one that fit me best and felt the ""lightest"" when weighted with sand bags in REI. The weight should carry mostly your hips (I liked about 90% on my hips, 10% on my shoulders) and you should be able to twist and move with it on without it sliding around or pinching you anywhere. Also, of course, you need to be able to fit ALL of your gear in the pack, not strapped to the outside. Trust me, it seems like a good idea to clip stuff on the outside but when it rains heavily or is extremely windy or you are going through Mahoosuc Notch, I wanted everything INSIDE that pack, safe and dry and contained.I took great pride in being able to pack so densely that my pack was small and contained. All of my gear is in there!!Pros:-Durable. Osprey knows how to make packs. They are the most popular type of pack on the trail by FAR and it's for good reason - they stand up to everything the trail throws at you. My original 65L looks almost new (after I washed it...) and I carried it for 3.5 months straight. The ONLY thing that was damaged was one mesh side pocket after I fell against a tree and got it caught on a branch. My 50L that I carried through CT, MA, VT, NH, and ME is in perfect condition. I treated my packs very well and was careful (as I was with all my gear) but I never heard a bad word about the durability of the Osprey Atmos/Aura line.-Adjustable. Lots of straps and clips on these packs. The height (the length between your hips and shoulders) is adjustable within reason, so if you are between standard sizes you can make it a Tall-Small or a Short-Medium, or whatever. I liked this feature a lot because I needed a small hipbelt but closer to a medium height, so I could adjust the Small to have a longer backplate. The top pouch, or 'brain', of the pack is also removable and there is a flap underneath that you can use as the top. Both options can clip into adjustable straps and are convenient for cinching down the pack to be more dense. I sent my 'brain' home while carrying both packs to lose weight and because I was barely using it. If you look again at the pictures above you can see the brain still on my green Atmos 65L and gone from my orange Atmos 50L.-Top and bottom loading options. The Atmos packs (and Aura line, the ladies' version) are top-loading, meaning that they have a drawstring at the top, under the brain/top flap, which opens to allow access to the entire pack all at once. They also have a SUPER convenient zipper flap on the bottom that you can open and access the bottom of the pack. I loved this because I could open it to pull out a heavy thing that I might need unexpectedly, like my food bag, without needing to empty the entire pack to get to the bottom. -The ""AG"" thing. The newer Atmos models sport ""Anti-Gravity"" back support. It's basically a heavy duty mesh that sits against your back while a neat engineering feature holds the actual pack an inch or two away from your body. This allows air to flow between you and your pack and really cuts down on sweating and chafing. I thought at first that the ""AG"" was a stupid gimmick, but it was the most comfortable feature of any pack that I've ever carried.The AG part is the gray mesh along the center. There's a gap between the mesh and the pack and it's AWESOMECons:-Expensive. This is not a cheap pack. I don't think mine will ever wear out if I continue to treat it properly but hey, quality is expensive. -Not ultralight. I'm not a very muscular human being or one with good cushion-y fat deposits. I was very worried that my pack would be uncomfortable and chafe in all kinds of places, so I chose to get one that has a good amount of padding. I tried to make myself fall in love with the Osprey Exos 58, which is a very light pack for the size because it has minimal padding, but it was SO uncomfortable on my shoulders and hips that I knew I would hate hiking with it. Like I said, packs are super personal items, and they NEED to be comfortable for you. Ultralight just wasn't in the cards for me.Do I recommend this gear? Yes, based on durability and convenience. As far as fit and comfort, I'll just say that I saw three people switch to Osprey Atmos/Aura packs from other brands during my hike and I don't think I'll ever buy a non-Osprey pack again. I also recommend that you try to buy the smallest volume pack possible for your gear - don't buy a larger pack just because you are nervous about 'emergencies' - it makes no sense and it was wrong for me to get a 65L at the beginning for basically no reason. Also - practice packing!! You'll be doing it at least once per day and probably more than once, so get good before you leave and have a consistent method of packing so that you always know where everything is and can reach it without fussing around, even in the dark or bad weather.Any questions!?

elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553929,"WARM WEATHER TOP (LUCY WORKOUT TEE) Gear Review!Weight: no idea. My shirt choice wasn't something that I overthought. I didn't search out the most lightweight option, or the best moisture wicking, or the one with the highest durability. I didn't care about color. I barely cared about fit. After spending beaucoup bucks on a tent, and pack, and sleeping setup, and water purification, and stove, and everything else, I honestly just walked into a Dick's Sporting Goods, tried on a few shirts and picked the one that was the cheapest and fit alright. I bought two - one black and one turquoise. I didn't think they'd last even a month each.I was wrong. One damn shirt went nearly the entire wayIn the middle of the Smoky Mountains I switched from the black top to the turquoise one. There wasn't really any reason except that I thought the black one might start to show stains from the salt in my sweat more than a lighter color. I wore the turquoise top from North Carolina to Katahdin! It didn't fall apart, it didn't itch, it didn't smell, it didn't stretch, and though it lost some color, it didn't get gross or turn brown or anything. I had no idea that this brand, ""Lucy"", actually made quality stuff. I wanted a shirt that was long in the back so it would cover my butt a bit more than a regular t-shirt and I didn't want a tank top because I was afraid that my pack would chafe my shoulders without a layer of protection. That's the entire thought process that went into my choice, ha!Pros:-Durable and Easy. It did exactly what I wanted it to, and it didn't look terrible. It was easy to wash (on warm, on hot, on cold, on whatever - it was fine) and easy to dry and when it got wet from sweat or rain it dried reasonably quickly on my body.Back view. You can see how it's a bit discolored after 5 months of sweat and wear but it's still in excellent shape-Fit. Okay, not that this was a HUGE deal, but it's a pretty cute shirt and I felt pretty cute wearing it, even sweaty and nasty. It's long in the back so it covered my butt and didn't ride up while I was hiking, which was GREAT. LIke I said, not a huge deal for my gear to be ""adorable"" but it was nice to be confident about taking pictures, at least with my pack off.Cons:-None.Do I recommend this gear? Yup.

elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553930,"LONG SHIRT AND LEGGINGS - CUDDL DUDS Gear Review!Weight: no idea...! Not muchLike my shirt choice, I didn't really think much about my long layers. I knew I wanted a tight fitting long sleeved shirt and a pair of leggings. I already owned a bunch of sets of the VERY basic ""Cuddl Duds"" stretchy, spandexy, from-WalMart-for-ten-bucks options and knew that they kept me warm and comfy while snowmobiling. I figured that I wouldn't be in temperatures colder than Michigan in January and that I'd be working out and sweating so I'd probably not get cold during the day. I had already bought a VERY warm sleeping bag and puff jacket so I just needed and extra layer to help a bit at night and for when it was a in-between temperature day. I picked up a purple long sleeved shirt and a pair of black leggings like I've been wearing around the house and through the winter for years - I'm telling you they were 9.96 at Wal-Mart and I probably even got them on sale. That SAME top and pair of leggings were with me on Springer Mountain and Mt. Katahdin. They both lasted 2,189 miles and I STILL WEAR THEM WEEKLY. Seriously. Who knew Wal-Mart could be a gear supplier??Day 1 - purple top and black leggingsOf course, after summertime hit in the Shenandoahs and the temperatures shot up during the day I very rarely wore my long sleeves while hiking. I still occasionally would wear my leggings during the day - if it rained, I wanted the leggings to be a barrier between my skin and my clingy rain pants, and if it was cold or I was doing lots of hand-over-hand climbing, I was more comfortable in leggings.Same leggings and long sleeves underneath my jacket on Mt. Washington in NHLeggings and previously-reviewed Lucy top in MainePros:-Durable and Easy. Same as the Lucy top from the last entry, both items did exactly what I wanted them to and didn't look terrible. They're also easy to wash (on warm, on hot, on cold, on whatever - totally fine) and easy to dry and when anything got wet from sweat or rain it dried reasonably quickly on my body.-Fit. Um, they're some kind of lightweight nylon spandex material and sorta just fit tight to your body. The leggings got a bit stretched out by the end of Maine but it wasn't a deal breaker. Cons:-Not a cold layer by themselves. If it was VERY cold, like it was in NC and TN, I needed to wear my Cuddl Duds layer and my puff jacket and rain pants over top. They aren't lined and they are relatively thin. I would not have chosen them as my base layer if I didn't already know that they worked for me in very cold weather (while snowmobiling). Full disclosure: I did wear Under Armour fleece-lined leggings to climb Katahdin but only because I was worried about the temperature and didn't want to have to carry my rain pants as a backup warmth layer.Do I recommend this gear? Yup. Literally still wear the same leggings and shirt weekly. I recommend them for lounging and for hardcore thru-hiking, but PLEASE TEST FIRST. I don't want to be responsible for you freezing to death because they don't work for you.Any questions!? Think I should add more info somewhere?

elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553939,"This might be a very lady-oriented post. I mean, if any of you guys out there want recommendations on which bikini underpants fit my booty the best or just really neeeeed to know why I loved my sports bras so much, go ahead and keep reading, I'll try not to judge. Just be warned: there are no pictures (that would be weird.) and I'm going to talk about lady fit issues.Okay. I'm going to start with underpants and then talk about my brassiere and socks after. Super personal stuff but I couldn't find much information on it when I was researching so I want to give all you hiker ladies my personal take on it. I recommend everything I used, so this won't be a pro/con type of update UNDERPANTS: ExOfficio Sport Mesh Bikini BriefFull disclosure: I started with no underwear. BAD DECISION, for me at least. I knew within a week that I was going to run into chafing and general cleanliness issues unless I got myself some damn underpants. These ExOfficio sport mesh underpants are awesome and I started carrying two pairs. They have some anti-microbial schtick that keeps them from getting extra disgusting. My recommendation is: DON'T WEAR COTTON unless you carry lots of pairs. My normal routine at the end of the hiking day was to bird-bathe in my tent (a.k.a. wash my whole body with a bandanna and some clean water mixed with peppermint Dr. Bronner's) and rinse out the ""active hiking pair"" that I wore that day. I'd wear my other set, my ""sleeping pair"" to bed that night. The next morning I'd put on the pair that I washed the night before and hike all day, repeating everything again that night. If I was going to be unable to shower or do laundry for more than 4 days, I'd switch the ""sleeping pair"" to active hiking duty around day 4 (depending on how sweaty or dirty the days were) and either not wear anything to bed or really wash the heck out of the first set and wear those. It's not a good idea to wear dirty clothes that close to your body - that's how chafing starts! Also, the best thing you can do to combat chafe is to wipe/rinse/wash the salty dried sweat and grime off your body before bed every night. It definitely helps keep your sleeping bag cleaner and less smelly, too. BRA: Panache Underwire Sports BraI'm a chesty lady. Can't help it. I need underwire and full coverage, 100% of the time. Lots of other hiker women wore stretchy built-in style sports bras (or nothing at all!) and were totally fine. I would not have been. If you are also a chesty lady and require round-the-clock support, these bras are FANTASTIC and I have worn them for many years. I did have to change sizes in Connecticut because I lost weight, but I've never been ""slender"" enough to be able to go braless. The Panache sports bras are pretty expensive but they are extremely comfortable and have a durable underwire and three-hook clasp that makes it impossible to accidentally unclip. My favorite feature is a hook-and-ring setup on the straps that can be used to turn it into a halter-style bra (like, the straps go from being parallel to being connected in an X). I would use the halter feature during the day and then unhook it at night. I wear support continuously, so I packed two bras. One was for hiking, the other was only for sleeping after bird-bathing or when my laundry was in the washing machine in town. PLEASE keep in mind that Panache uses ""UK"" sizing, so you need to measure yourself according to their specs or go to a fancy shop that carries them and try them on there. It's not the same as Victoria's Secret. SOCKS: Darn Tough Socks Of course.By Massachusetts, I knew NOBODY who wore anything other than Darn Tough wool socks. They're simply the best and Darn Tough has the best lifetime guarantee of any sock manufacturer out there. Plus, they're adorable and I love them. I had one of the Boot Socks Cushion (a heavier weight) for cold weather and for sleeping, and two of the Micro Crew Cushion (medium weight) for hiking. I carried three pairs because wearing salty, grimy, crusty, stiff, disgusting socks are AWFUL for your feet, and if there's anything you want to keep in tip-top shape while on a thru hike, it's your feet. I'd change out socks about every 3 days and if I needed to go longer I'd wash them thoroughly in a mix of clean water and Dr. Bronner's by sticking everything in a plastic bag and shaking it (like a hiker washing machine!) until the water turned brown and nasty.You think I'm joking, but this was my water after washing one pair of socks. YUCK.In conclusion, bring enough undergarments so you can change them out often enough to support your personal comfort. Some people carried far more pairs of underwear or socks than I did, and some carried far fewer. It's personal preference, but this is what worked for me. I tried to go in to a town for a shower and laundry about once every 7-10 days, so keep that in mind. I wasn't the type of hiker to go weeks without shower or laundry - I wouldn't have been able to stand the smell of myself and my clothes would have gotten too grimy to be hygienic.Any questions!?

elle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554472,"STERIPEN ULTRA Gear Review!Weight: 4.96oz (0.31 lbs)Image copyright SteriPEN/Hydro-PhotonThere are three main ways to clean your water on the trail. #1 - Physical Filter (such as the Sawyer)#2 - UV Sterilization (such as the SteriPEN)#3 - Chemicals (such as Aquamira) I chose #2, the UV sterilization, because I didn't feel that a third of a pound would be breaking my back and because it felt much more reliable than a filter. I had read reviews of leaky seals on Sawyer filters, broken filters, and problems with cleaning it. You need to ""backflush"" filters with clean water to prevent yucky stuff from forming and to get the accumulated gunk out or else your filter will work VERY slowly. That sounded complicated. I also didn't want to pump water every time I needed some - it takes so much time - and I wanted to carry Nalgene bottles. The SteriPEN is perfect for using with Nalgenes and that made me feel good. I have an affinity for Nalgenes. I carry one with me everywhere and they're basically unbreakable. I use a Camelbak when I hike short distances, though - it's a brand of hydration pack. There's a soft pouch that you carry on your back and there's a hose with a mouthpiece that hangs over your shoulder that you drink through. It's convenient but I did not want to fuss with the pouch and hose and filling it and everything. Some people carried them. I did not.This is how I carried my water. I liked having big 1 Liter Nalgenes because it felt super solid (though this shows one Nalgene and one Powerade bottle, because I somehow lost a Nalgene in Vermont. Oops)Pros:-SO FAST AND EASY. It took some other hikers HALF AN HOUR to filter one liter with a Sawyer. Aquamira takes something like 5 minutes to mix then another 30 minutes to work before you can drink the water. My SteriPEN takes 90 seconds to sterilize an entire liter of water. It takes only 45 seconds for a half liter. All you have to do is collect the water and stick the SteriPEN in it, and swirl it around for about a minute. SO FAST. SO EASY.-Rechargeable. I carried the SteriPEN Ultra. It's a pretty small version that is rechargeable with a microUSB cord. Since I also use an Android phone I was already carrying a microUSB and my brother had generously bought me a very powerful portable battery that I could use to recharge it rather than bringing extra batteries with me everywhere. I liked that it was rechargeable and it felt so much easier than carrying extra batteries or whatever.-Simple. A filter has multiple parts and the chemicals are caustic and require mixing and pouring. I carried one thing. It was simple. I like Nalgenes. I don't like SmartWater bottles (lots of people with filters used SmartWater bottles because they are one liter and have a screw top that fits with the filter). Also, the Nalgenes fit well in my Osprey Atmos pack pouches and were easily accessible. It may be worth checking to see what water system works best with your pack - some side pockets just aren't the right size for Nalgenes or are hard to get to. You want to be able to access your water, fill your system, clean your system, and put it pack in place without needing any help. Independence! Woo!Cons:-Maybe fragile? The part that you stick in the water (the part with the light) is glass. It comes with a protective plastic cover that snaps on securely as well as a neoprene pouch to store the whole thing. I didn't have any problems at all with fragility but I guess it was a little bit more susceptible to drops than a filter would be. Bear in mind that I heard stories of Aquamira bottles breaking and burning chemical holes in packs and of filter parts bursting (especially those squeeze bags)... but I thought I'd mention that part of the SteriPEN is glass.-Not a physical filter. Here's the main con of not having a filter: you can't filter out the silt and dirt. Sometimes my water was a little bit gritty. I could pour my water through my spare bandanna to filter out some of the grit but it was never as good as using a real micron filter. I didn't really mind because almost all of the water sources on the trail (like, 98%) were beautifully pure and I didn't notice any grit at all. Mountain streams and springs are CLEAN! The remaining 2% I either sucked it up and drank slightly sandy water or I asked a hiker friend to filter for me (in return I would SteriPEN their water the next time). There were 3 times that the water was yucky enough that all of us got together and SteriPENned/Sawyered/AND Aquamira-ed everything to feel safe.Do I recommend this gear? Yup. You guys. SteriPENs aren't very popular anymore. I saw mostly filters on the trail - mostly the Sawyer and Sawyer Mini - and they worked just fine. I'm just here to say that I loved my little SteriPEN and I loved the little happy face that showed up whenever I cleaned my water. LOOK AT THE CUTE HAPPY FACE!Any questions!?
