Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529422,"We are Spider and ET (Energizer Turtle). We are hiking the AT in ~500 mile sections. We have been called LASHers by the thru-hikers we have met on the trail (Long Ass Section Hikers!!). We have completed 3 sections starting in 2012 in Georgia. We had to skip our hike last year due to one elderly parent falling and breaking her hip and another one's death.So we are anxious to get back to our hiking. We will start in southern New York state and finish in New Hampshire, if everything goes as planned. We will be heading for the trail in mid-June.More to come!!",,Home,"Apr 23, Sat",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529645,"We began to ""dust off"" last year's plans. Spider laid out a detailed plan for miles/day, food drops, town stops etc. last year. We are now applying these plans to this year's hike. We have to refresh the food and test the equipment, but it should be easier than starting fresh. Spider usually walks the trail vicariously as he prepares the detail of the hike, so he is going to need refresh his memory of the trail again.",,Home,"Apr 24, Sun",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531197,Took down all our hiking gear from the attic yesterday. Also printed out my packing list that I have developed over the years (so I don't forget anything!!). Amped up the exercise a little at the gym today too. Will get my pack packed over the next couple of days and add in some hiking with pack and trekking poles as part of the exercise program.I've contacted friends we have made along the AT in previous years to see if we can reconnect. Unfortunately most have plans that will prohibit us from reconnecting this year...maybe next year!!,,Home,"May 03, Tue",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533922,"We have made a first pass on our gear. With having to cancel our hike at the last minute last year, everything is pretty much still ready to go. Refreshing some of the food means a trip to Costco, Trader Joe's etc. We have upped our exercise program by including a 5 mile hike around one of our local reservoirs. Spider packed his pack (see picture) to make it more realistic. Without water and food, the pack is just under 30 lbs. We both are on diets trying to lose more weight to take pressure off our knees, but with a wedding, a vacation in Mazatlan and a get-together with old friends...it's going to be a challenge!!",,Home,"May 07, Sat",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533924,"We are home from a week in Mazatlan. Spider gained 4 lbs that he now has to re-lose!! We both hit the fitness center at the resort so hopefully didn't lose any muscle..we just need to get rid of the fat!! Spider is working on the detail of our hike like he does every year... camping and water sources, trail condition and Zero Day accommodations. He's about half-way through the hike. ET is accumulating the food. She is about done, so we will begin boxing everything up in about a week. Only 27 days to go before we climb on a plane to Newark!!",,Home,"May 18, Wed",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536156,"Less than 2 weeks to go. We have collected all our food and will start packing our boxes to be shipped out...starting next week. Before then, we will be marrying off our youngest son this weekend. Talk about packing our life!! The training and weight-loss programs are becoming hit-and-miss. We may have to let the trail be our training/diet plan.I've been confirming the details of our hike and our transportation to the AT. Since we can't fly with stove fuel, I'm planning on making a quick trip to an outfitter to pick up fuel in New York City as we wait for our bus to Greenwood Lake. We are planning on hitting the trail the same day we arrive at Newark. Dinner will be at Bud Whitt's Hot Dog Plus stand on NY 17A and dessert at the Creamery down the road. Looking forward to getting back on the AT....current weather forecast looks okay for our first day...Hope it holds.",,Home,"Jun 01, Wed",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537045,"With a little over a week to go we are watching the weather forecast for the day we hit the trail, June 15. Each morning we take a look at it and each day it has changed...so we have no idea whether it will be raining or not, hot or not, humid or not. Guess we need to get into the ""trail"" frame of mind...What will be, will be.ET and I both have our long to-do lists put together of things that need to get done before leaving. Each day we knock off a few...unfortunately a few are also added each day. I have about 40 items on my list so may have to sacrifice some days of golf to get everything done...Oh No!!I stopped by Walmart today and picked up some Permithrin spray. We sprayed our hiking clothes with it when we hiked our last section of the AT in 2014 and had very little tick problems. So will do it again this year.The first two week's trail food is sorted out and Week 2 is boxed up and ready to be sent out tomorrow. We will ship one more box the day we leave next week, then ET's sister, Sally, will mail one each week we are gone.",,Home,"Jun 06, Mon",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537674,"Only 5 days left to get everything ready for a 6 week hike. We are getting the clothes by spraying with Permithrin insecticide. It supposedly harmless to humans but deadly to ticks...which is why we do it. It seemed to work in 2014 when we did the same thing...only had a couple of ticks on us. Given the prevalence of Lyme Disease in the East, we want to do everything we can to prevent the little ""critters"" invading our bodies. We also put a waterproofing on our boots. It works for the ""casual"" wetness from dew and drizzle, but when it really gets wet, especially when the trail is flooded, no amount of waterproof will keep your feet dry.I checked with the Countryside Motel in Cold Springs, NY today and confirmed our box of food for week 2 has arrived...Now all we have to do is get there!!",,Home,"Jun 10, Fri",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537975,"Our living room is full of boxes being filled with freeze dried food, jerky, M&Ms, Tang and so on. We will mail our next box on Tuesday before we head for the airport. Spider still has 28 items on his to-do list and ET has an equivalent amount...may be some late nights coming up!! We are actually looking forward to getting on the trail. In many ways, life is easier...all you have to do is to get from Point A to Point B..the complications are weather and terrain.We took a day off of hike preparation to attend the celebration of Spider's graduation from High School 50 years ago!! He couldn't understand where all those old people came from!! We are now back to working on our to-do lists.",,Home,"Jun 12, Sun",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538249,"Day 0: We finished what we needed to get done for the hike by about 5pm. Since we have a midnight flight, we had the whole day to work on the last to-dos...even had time to do a little weeding and trimming in the yard, so we won't come back to a jungle. We finished packing our boxes of food and got Box 2 to the Post Office.ET's sister, Sally, is house sitting for us while we are on the AT. She will ship the remaining boxes about 2 weeks before we reach each destination. She also gave us a ride to our rapid transit system, BART, rather than us having to take a bus.BART efficiently whisked us to SFO. We checked our packs, but are carrying a few things: books, jacket, etc., in paper bags as carry-ons. It's interesting to travel knowing that whatever we bring will have to be carried on the trail for 6 weeks. Thus the paper bags...they are easily disposed of before we hit the trail.We arrived at the airport around 7:30pm...plenty of cushion...This is ET's preference. We ate dinner in an airport sports bar while watching a SF Giants game. Now we wait...that is why we also brought books to read and crossword puzzles in our paper bags. The attached picture is of ET, patiently waiting at the airport.We hope to get some sleep on our cross-country flight...Otherwise tomorrow is going to be a long day!","Home

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538451,"Day 1 - Well we made it back to the AT, only not as expeditiously as planned. Things started falling apart when our plane was delayed an hour because of a mechanical problem. They made up about half an hour flying cross country from SFO to Newark. Now sleeping on a red-eye in economy is no fun especially for 6 foot 3 inch Spider!! As you might expect we primarily dozed intermittently.Once we landed we got our packs at baggage claim. It took us a little while to figure out where the shuttle bus was that would take us to the Port Authority building in downtown New York City. From there we will catch a New Jersey Transit bus to Greenwood Lake, NY...a town near the AT. We were trying to catch the 11:30am bus to Greenwood Lake. So when we got on the 9:40 shuttle, we figured the 30 minute ride advertised on their website would still give us plenty of time. 2 hours later we arrived at the Port Authority!! The traffic backup at the Lincoln Tunnel was horrendous.So now we wait for the 1:30pm bus to Greenwood Lake, We better make this one because the next one isn't until 7:30pm!! However before we can get on the bus to Greenwood Lake we need to get fuel for our backpacking stove. Airlines won't let you carry it on the plane. Spider had done his research and found that a couple short subway rides away was an REI in Lower Manhattan. So ET guarded our packs at a Starbucks in the Port Authority (with a big cup of coffee in hand!!) while Spider made the trip to REI. An hour later we had 4 fuel canisters.The bus ride to Greenwood Lake was uneventful and we arrived at 3:30pm. We bought a couple things at a local market, then headed to the beginning of the Vista Trail...a side trail that runs from Greenwood Lake to the AT. It is 0.9 miles long and climbs 700 feet. There is a baseball field near the beginning where we took advantage of the benches to change our packs from airplane mode to trail mode. We finally started up the Vista Trail at 4:18pm. 40 minutes later we were back on the AT...Wahoo!! ???The AT was in pretty good shape so we made good time to the crossing of NY 17A highway. Here we left the trail to walk to a local ice cream place 0.3 miles up the road. We passed by a hot dog stand where we had originally planned an early dinner but it closed at 3pm..not sure we could have made it even if we had caught the earlier bus.After a dinner of a double scoop of freshly made ice cream each, we hiked back to the AT. After about a mile on a mildly rock trail we came to our first rock scramble of the day, Eastern Pinnacles. The attached picture shows Spider on his way up. A \'rock scramble\'? is where the trail goes almost vertical and we are scrambling up trying to find toe and finger holds. Often our trekking poles are useless because we need to use our hands...so they just dangle by their straps. After about 100 yards of scrambling we were back on a regular trail?...for a while!! Soon we had another rock scramble over Cat Rocks...sure is tough scrambling when we are \'city soft\', end of the day and on very little sleep!!We finally reach our destination for the day, Wildcat Shelter, at 8:05pm. The shelter looked full and there appeared to be 8-10 tents already set up. We said our hellos then quickly set up our tent...it was getting dark!We moved into our tent as the last of the sunlight disappeared. Sure feels good to get horizontal!! I am typing this well passed Hiker\'s Midnight (9pm) as ET sleeps soundly.Animal sighting: turtle and chipmunk?","SFO

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538532,"Day 2 - I do believe this was the toughest day of hiking I have ever experienced!! It took us over 12 hours to go 11.6 miles... less than one mile per hour.Things started out normal. After our long day yesterday, we slept in later than normal, so we didn't hit the trail until 8:10 am. It had rained overnight but was only sprinkling when we got up. The trail followed a ridge until turning right and dropping into a nearby valley. After crossing the valley we climbed to Fitzgerald Falls where the attached picture was taken. It was a relatively easy climb to the top of the falls where we had breakfast. Then the fun began!! The map showed a series of ups and downs of about 500ft. What it didn't show was that these where hand-over-hand vertical rock climbs and descents. Every time we finished one, another was around the corner. These ups and downs used up lots of energy and slowed us down significantly. We were beginning to wonder if we were going to make it to our planned destination… then it started to rain!! Now all the rocks got slippery and we had to slow down even more!! Even with that, Spider slipped and fell once… nothing broken but a skinned elbow and an injured pride.Our last mile to Island Pond was a fairly steep trail...at least it wasn't hand-over-hand and it had stopped raining!! We trudged that last mile with our last bit of energy. We arrived at 8:20pm just as the sun was setting. ET started putting up the tent while Spider went for water from the pond. It took him forever to get the water and as it got darker and darker ET started to get worried. However when she called out he immediately answered because he was already headed back. The problem was the new filter we are carrying. It works on gravity and is painfully slow.As the time was already passed 9pm, we decided to eat a couple of Cliff Bars we had instead of firing up the stove. Finally to bed at 10pm... It had been a long day!!Animal Sightings: Rabbit and BeaverPlant Sightings: Poison Ivy and Wild Rose","Wildcat

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538833,"Day 3 - We awoke at 5:45am. It had been a fairly noisy night with all the beaver activity and Bullfrog serenade, but we were so tired we slept though most of it. We hit the trail at 6:30am. We hoped we wouldn't face the same challenges as yesterday because the plan was to go about the same distance... not sure our bodies could survive another 'onslaught' like that again!!Within a mile we had to negotiate the “Lemon Squeezer”...the attached picture shows ET going through it, after which, we had to climb a wall of rocks… Uh Oh!! Fortunately is was mostly trails after that with only a few short rock climbs… nothing like yesterday. However there were plenty of ups and downs...and we definitely could feel the effect of yesterday...no power in the legs going uphill!! We took one side trip to a park that had water fountains… where we stocked up on water and vending machines that we each got an ice cream from..Mmmm!!We knew our destination shelter didn't have any water, so we filled up at a stream just before the shelter. Unfortunately it was a steep climb to the shelter and being loaded down with water made it a real slog. On top of that, it was a 0.5 mile side trail walk to the shelter. We finally arrived at 6:45pm… another 12 hours plus day to go 11plus miles… we need to get our 'trail legs'!!There were quite a few hikers at the shelter even with the long walk in. The attraction is that you have great view, including the New York City skyline.We ate dinner and talked to some of the other hikers. To bed by 9pm… much more civilized day of hiking.Animal Sightings: DeerPlant Sightings: Huckleberries (we think!!)?","Island Pond

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538918,"Day 4 - Woke up at 5am and we're elated to see the first sunrays reflecting off the buildings in downtown Manhattan way off in the distance!! We knew we had a longer miles today than the previous days, so we hit the trail at 6am.Interesting that the 0.5 miles walk back to the AT didn't seem near as far this morning. Once on the AT we followed a ridge with periodic views down into the valley below.One thing we have been wondering about ever since getting on the trail was what major construction excavation project was going on with a lot dynamiting.? Throughout each day we would hear periodic ""booms"", often one right after the other. Today we figured it out, it wasn't Dynamite, it was cannon fire!! No World War III has not started. We were only a few dozen miles from West Point and as we hiked closer today we could also hear small arms fire...not something we expect to hear hiking in the wilderness!!Soon after leaving the ridge we came to Bear Mountain. It was a 700 foot climb to the top and fairly steep. But the unique thing was, there were steps made of granite blocks built into the mountain. Engineered gravel paths connected each set of stairs...it was like climbing the stairs in a 100 story building. Good workout for the thigh muscles!Once at the top, we viewed the Perkins Tower, grabbed a couple of cold drinks from the vending machines and headed down the mountain. Construction of the engineered trail on this side of the mountain is not completed, so the first part was our old friend of steep, slow, rocky? descent. However when we hit the engineered portion we had steps and gravel trail. This side of the mountain, we also found hordes of people. This being a Saturday, lots of people were taking advantage of the Bear Mountain Recreation Area.At the bottom of the mountain is a lake, inn, BBQ areas etc... also a concession stand. That's where we had lunch. A cheese burger and fries is much better than jerky and dried fruit. We also filled up our water bottles from the bathroom taps?. All in all it was a 1.5 hour stop.Next we walked through a small zoo associated with the Recreation Area and with the hordes of people. Yes the AT goes through a zoo! Nothing was of any particular interest except the black bear exhibit. The black bears are bigger here vs the West Coast. We loved that the exhibit had a hammock which the bear crawled into.Somewhere in meandering through the zoo we passed the lowest point on the AT...124 feet?. After leaving the zoo, we hiked up on Bear Mountain Bridge and crossed the Hudson River...which is where the attached picture was taken.The problem with being at the lowest point is that everything is now up! So soon after crossing the Hudson River, we started to climb...steeply. The problem was that this particular stretch of the AT is also the way to Anthony's? Nose...a popular rock outcropping above the Hudson. So every 10 feet we sloggers had to step aside to let the gazelles without backpacks pass by. Needless to say, this slowed us down. We were happy to find out that when we reached the top, the people going to Anthony's Nose turned right but the AT went left. It was nice to leave the ""zoo"" in a couple of ways!!After several more ups and downs we arrived at the Appalachian Market. This is a convenience store extraordinaire with burgers, specialty sandwiches, made to order etc. We stopped here for dinner. This is the way we save weight in our pack… eat out when we can!!After dinner we had about a mile hike to the Graymoor Seminary, arriving at 7:25pm. They allow hikers to stay on their ball field where there are porta-potties, water, cold showers and, best of all, power outlets to recharge cellphones!!We talked to the other hikers then went to bed. This was our highest mileage so far for this hike.Major milestone: we passed the 1400 miles hike on the AT today.","West Mountain Shelter

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539422,"Day 5 - A very different hiking day today... the only people we saw today were other hikers in the woods...no picnickers, no crying babies in strollers and no bears in hammocks!!We hit the trail at 6:30am...we were first out of Camp. We immediately climbed to a ridge and followed it for several miles. As is our usual pattern, we stopped after 1.5 hours for breakfast. We find that we are not usually hungry when we first wake up, but we are after an hour or so we are ready to eat...this also gets us out of camp earlier. We try to stop for breakfast in a place with a view, if possible. We have had breakfast at some wonderful 'venues'!!After breakfast we descended to what would be the first of multiple road crossings for the day. Of course the problem with road (and river) crossings is that it means we have to climb up afterwards!! For this day, the descents and subsequent climbs were fairly steep.Three days ago it rained so the humidity was 100% and the temperatures were in the 70's. Every day after that has been mostly clear but temperatures have been rising. Today it was 90 degrees with about 60% humidity. Either way, rain or shine, we sweat whenever we start exerting ourselves!!We continued the pattern of waking the forest on a ridge then dropping to a road only to climb back to the ridge. Most of the descents and climbs were fairly steep. At the second to last road we found trail magic for the second time on this hike. ""Trail Magic"" is a service or a gift to a hiker by a stranger… this can take the form of a ride from or to the trail, water caches on dry stretches or snack left beside the trail...we have even seen a guy in Tennessee set up a BBQ at a road crossing and serve burgers to passing hikers!! The people who do this are called ""Trail Angels"". They do this to support the hiker community, usually at no cost to the hikers. For this trip, trail angels left water caches at several road crossings on Day 2 when there was very little natural water and today with an ice chest with cold beer. ET doesn't usually drink beer and Spider decided not to risk being further dehydrated by drinking alcohol...but it sure looked good!! Instead we took some of the ice to cool down our bottles of water...Thanks Trail Angels!!After crossing our last road we had a climb that included a short hand over hand portion. After climbing 300 feet, we dropped down to, what appeared to be, an old narrow gauge railroad bed. It was flat and smooth so we were able to increase our pace. We covered the last mile of our hike in the same time it took to cover the previous 0.5 milesWe arrived at Highway 301 at 5:15pm. Spider had been trying for the last couple of days to connect with a trail angel to transport us to a nearby motel, but had been unable to connect with her. So we went to Plan B...call a taxi!! The taxi arrived at 5:45pm and whisked us the Countryside Motel. We checked in and found that our resupply box of food for next week was waiting for us...Wahoo!! After checking in our first order of business was… you guessed it, a shower?!! After making ourselves less odiferous, we put on our only clean set of clothes and walked 0.3 miles down the road to an Italian restaurant. Our attire didn't exactly fit in, but they seated us then stood back and watched us down a bunch of food!!When we checked in at the motel, we found out that the deli across the road had closed. Since the Italian restaurant is closed on Mondays, we ordered a second set of dinners to-go so we would have something for tomorrow night. On the way back to the motel, we stopped at a nearby liquor store and bought a bottle of Chianti...dinner is set for tomorrow!!Once back in our room the effects of a long day, a full stomach and a bottle of wine over dinner took effect. ET made it through 2 paragraphs of her book before falling asleep and Spider fought sleep long enough to see the Warriors lose in the NBA Finals...Boo Hoo!!Major milestone: we passed 50 miles on this year's hike...only about 450 miles to go!!","Graymoor Spiritual Center

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539425,"Day 6 - Zero in terms of AT miles, but not in terms of feet miles. With no food options nearby, we walked 2 miles down the highway to a delicatessen for breakfast. It's what a hiker does on their day off!!The short hike without a pack felt good - loosened up our tight muscles. The made-to-order breakfast sandwiches were delicious. We bought sandwiches for lunch too, which set us up for the day. (Lasagna ordered the previous night was already stored in our room.)On the way to breakfast we dropped off our dirty clothes for washing, at the front desk. They charged us $10, which we were happy to pay. No trudging to a laundromat, and they had to deal with quite a stink!! Everything came back smelling so nice, we are concerned that bears might come sniffing by.Most of our day off was spent relaxing in our room, catching up with family by phone, reserving our taxi for the next day, studying maps for next week's hike, reading, eating and repacking our packs.Spider usually assesses our health and wellness at each break in our hike. We made it with no injuries...a big plus. Both of us had knees that were talking to us on Day 5, but felt fine on our day off. ET is babying the 4 blisters she got on that first long, full day of hiking rock walls. She doesn't usually get blisters, so this was a surprise. Fortunately, they aren't bothering her much and that is typical. Spider also has a couple of blisters and they are bothering him...which is also typical. No ticks. Few mosquito bites. All is good so far!!The attached photo shows our motel. Its city is Cold Spring, where a lot of people stay, if they are visiting West Point directly across the Hudson. The motel is actually inland a bit, in a light industry area, with a dearth of conveniences, like restaurants. The motel offers a ""hiker rate"", but expects hikers to drive for coffee in the morning! (No coffee makers in the room.) They seem to take a minimalist approach to other things too like no shampoo and not much toilet paper. If we had it to do over we would go into a hotel in the town of Cold Spring and pay the higher price for the convenience of stores, restaurants etc.Well we got done what we needed to and got some rest...so it's back to the trail tomorrow.","Countryside Motel, Cold Spring, NY

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539427,"Day 7 - Yes today, the longest day of the year, is known as 'Hike Naked Day' on all the long trails like the PCT and the AT. However when Spider asks ET each year if we were going to participate, all he gets a 'No way'!! We got up at 5:30 am and took showers (the last ones for a while!!), we finished packing our packs and went out to meet our taxi at 6:30am...and guess what, it was raining. Rain was forecast for overnight, but it was supposed to be done by now!! Oh well, on with pack rain covers.20 minutes later we hit the trail at 6:50am. Fortunately the rain was so light most of it was being trapped by the tree so very little was getting to the trail. We started out on a rocky trail with short ups and downs. It worked it's way around Canopus Lake then climbed to a view point where we took the attached picture. By this time the rain had stopped. Most of the time we are in a 'green tunnel’ of trees, so it's nice to come to a view point periodically.After some rockier climbing we began following a dirt trail with very few rocks...it was nice to stride out for a change!! In fact today was the first time that the majority of the day we were on dirt trails vs rocky trails.Interestingly we only saw 2 hikers today, one northbound (the direction we are going) and one starting going southbound...and they were both clothed!! Before we got off the trail for our Zero Day, we were hiking with about a half dozen other hikers and see others at our camp spot each evening. Such is the idiosyncrasies of the AT.After starting out rainy, everything cleared out leaving us with blue sky. Consequently, the temperature ros to 85 degrees but the wind was blowing fairly hard so it felt cooler.We arrived at our destination, NY 52 at 4:30pm...not bad, over 12 miles in a little more than 9.5 hours. That's what a good trail will do for us!! We actually considered continuing on for about 4 miles to the next shelter but decided to stick to our schedule of a slow buildup of miles...to slowly strengthen muscles and toughen feet.So we walked 0.4 miles down to the Mountain Top Deli. They offer water and a tent spot for hikers.We bought a couple of cold drinks and sat outside the Deli and quickly downed them. Then we headed to a grassy field where we set up our tent. We actually had time to relax after a day's hike...a first for this trip so far!!At 6:30pm Spider walked back to the Deli for some sandwiches and drinks. When he returned, we sat next to our tent and ate dinner...including the brownie that somehow found its way into our dinner bag. As I write this, we are still the only ones here!","Countryside Motel, Cold Spring, NY

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539430,"Day 8 - We awoke at 5:45am. It turned out that we were the only hikers who stayed in the grassy field. We packed up and, at 6:45am, headed to the deli. There we met another hiker who had slept behind the deli building. His Trail-name was Shrink because in ""real"" life he is a therapist.? We bought some breakfast at the deli and while we ate it, talked to Shrink. We finally pulled ourselves away and hit the trail at 7:30am.We hiked back up the road to the AT and began our first climb for the day. It was a nice trail for a while but eventually turned rocky. In fact it was very similar to yesterday's mix of ups vs downs and smooth vs rocky trail.One of the interesting things we walked by was a body of water called ""Nuclear Lake"". The story is that in the 1960s there was a nuclear fuels research center at the lake. They had an ""accident"" and were closed down in 1972. The area was remediated and declared safe, so the AT was routed by the lake. As we hiked by we were looking for any strange glow in the water or any abnormal birds or fish, but saw none...Whew!!We arrived at our destination at 4:45pm. To our surprise the water source, a small stream, was dry...Uh Oh!! While ET looked to see if there were places to set up our tent, Spider went down to the stream to see how bad it really was. When we got back together, the news wasn't good: no flat spots for tents and only small pools of standing water. Our dilemma was that there was a chance of rain so staying in the shelter had its advantages...but with no water, we had a problem. On top of that ET felt she didn't have the energy to make it 3 more miles to the next place to camp with water. So we decided to stay in the shelter and ration what water we had left. Our first time staying in a shelter for this trip! Spider decided to head further upstream to see if there was water there. After about 20 minutes of exploring he found a small pool of cold, clear water that had water flowing in and out...Whew!!We had the shelter to ourselves. Most hikers probably bypassed it because of no water. The attached shows us setting up in it.This shelter gets its name? from the local chapter of the Association of Telephone Pioneers who built it in 1988. They had the material flown in by a Sikosky Skycrane.Once again we saw few hikers today… only 4. We have found that, over time, thru-hikers (those hiking the entire AT in one season) get spread out but end up in groups or bubbles on the trail. I think we are between bubbles right nowAnimal sighting: small racer snake, frogs and Canadian Geese","Mountaintop Deli, NY Route 52

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539431,"Day 9 - We slept OK in the shelter, though the wood floor was much harder than lawn we slept on the previous night. And the mosquitos were annoying. Fortunately, we neither saw nor heard any mice that are often ""residents"".We heard many trains during the night and ET twice heard what she thought was a pack of coyotes yipping, not howling, but yipping.It was nice having the place to ourselves. We awoke at 5:00 and were out at 6:07, without having to worry about keeping quiet for late sleepers.When we got down the hill from the shelter we came upon a huge oak tree, which you see ET standing next to in the photo. The AT guidebook says it's the largest oak tree (Dover Oak) on the AT, 20.4 feet in girth and estimated to be over 300 years old.Then for a complete change, we walked several miles along the edges of fields, climbing 3 stiles (imagine 2 wooden ladders propped against each other) over electric fences. This reminded us of our hiking in Pennsylvania two years ago. In between one set of fields, we walked on a raised boardwalk over a huge swampy area. We also stopped at a Native Plant Landscape business to get water and were invited inside to use a kitchen sink. Ah...true luxury.Back to the forest of trees and, fortunately, minimal rocks, we made good progress, averaging 1.5 miles per hour while hiking. We came upon another shelter just in time for second lunch. The shelter featured improvements such as tenting platforms made out of wood (great for rain), hand pump over a spring (for consistent water availability) and a lending library box!And next came the Connecticut state line. We are now hiking in our 10th state! It looks the same, except...trail angels have returned. We stopped at 2 ice chest stashes, one with water and apples and the second with soft drinks, chips and packaged pastries. Yummmm! We had just been talking about how, except for a couple water caches, we had not seen much in the way of Trail Magic in New York. Now Connecticut is looking good!!We decided to tent instead of shelter at the next shelter, because there was a specifically designated tenting area. Turns out it was right on the river, flat and beautiful. We arrived at 4:30pm. ET set up the tent (her usual chore) and Spider got water (his usual chore). He chose to walk back to the shelter and get water from the spring using the hand pump provided, rather than take water from the river. Then we took turns soaking our feet in the river. It was revitalizing!!We only saw 1 hiker heading our way today and it was someone we had met in our first shelter, Wildcat Shelter, his trail name is Manatee. He had taken a couple days off to visit family and this was his first day back on the trail.Major milestone: Finished hiking 9th state out of 14","Telephone Pioneer Shelter

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540221,"Day 10 - We attempted our biggest miles so far on this trip and made it...but it took us 13.5 hours. We started at a campsite next to the Housatonic River and ended at a campsite on the Housatonic, but in between we climbed up over 1000 feet.We got up at 5am and hit the trail at 6am?. At first it was a fairly easy forest and road walk, but then we started to climb Schaghicoke Mountain and things got ugly, steep and lots of granite steps and boulder hopping. We climbed 1000 feet then contoured the side of a ridge for several miles. But this was not an easy contour because it included many little ups and downs over boulders. The last major climb was to Caleb's Peak. That is where today's photo was taken. From a view point on Caleb's Peak we could see Schaghicoke Mountain and the route we had come.?Soon after Caleb's Peak Came St. John's Ledges. This was a nearly vertical drop from the mountain to the Housatonic River...and we get down it! The AT engineer found a rock fall and added a few steps in places and that became the AT! One of the most vertical descents we have made so far. ET slide down rocks on her butt many times. Once down, we breathed a sigh of relief and had a nice flat walk along the Housatonic to our campsite. We arrived at 7:30pm...Maybe we should have picked a different terrain to do 15+ miles!! Ironically we thought we had arrived late. Over the next hour 4 thru-hikers wandered into camp. A hardy group, these thru-hikers!Major Milestone: We passed 100 miles today… only 400 to go!!","Ten Mile Lean-to Tent Area

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540222,"Day 11 - We awoke at 5:10 am and were on the trail by 6:20am. We continued our level walk along the Housatonic River and made very good time...then we started our first climb of the day. We had lots of ups and downs today...700 feet up, 300 feet down, then 400 feet up and so on. Most of the climbs we rocky, but the climb up some no-name became a scramble and soon we were going through a slot akin to the Lemon Squeezer we went through on Day 3..as you can see in the attached picture. After that, more ups and downs!!As you might imagine, even though we were the first out of camp this morning, we were quickly passed by the 4 thru-hikers that had tented with us... Ah youth!! However a young couple out for a weekend backpacking trip, started yo-yo-ing with us, i.e. passing us when we took a break, then we would pass them when they took a break. So there is somebody our speed. At one of our passings we struck up a conversation and found out they were going to the same campsite we were. However they said that, even though all maps and books say there is water at the site, it has dried up. Apparently they are having an unusually dry year and many of the streams have dried up, which we have noticed in New York and now in Connecticut. So now what? Do we 1) stop at an earlier shelter that has water and make tomorrow a 15+mile day...or 2) do we water up at the previous shelter and haul it about 2.5 miles to our planned destination ...or 3) do we make this a 15+ mile day and hike on to the next shelter and hope it's water source is not dried up. We decided on option #2.We arrived at Sharon Mountain Campsite at 5pm, with the young couple arriving a few minutes later. Spider explored further up the dry creek bed with hopes of finding running water like at Telephone Pioneers Shelter, but no luck. By the time he returned, the campsite area was mostly full. Hikers had been pouring in. You can always tell when it's a weekend.","Stewart Hallow Brook Shelter

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540223,"Day 12 - We awoke at our usual 5am and tried to quietly pack up, since we were surrounded by other hiker tents. However, ""quiet"" meaning ""silent"" is not possible, when ?we pack most of our stuff in plastic bags to keep them dry in wet weather. I'm sure we woke up a couple of people.?We hit the trail at 6am with one thought in mind...water! We had about 3 pints left and the next supposed water source was 2.8 miles away. We sure hoped this one wasn't dry like the last few had been. Fortunately, we were hiking in the cool (60 degrees) of the morning and tend to drink less water then. After a few short ups and downs we made our 700 foot? descent back down to the Housatonic River Valley. Just before we reached the valley floor, we saw a sign ""Water"" at a side trail off the AT. A short distance down the side trail, we came to a spring that was bubbling cold clear water...Whew!!So a little about the water situation. Since we have? been hiking, we've noticed that it's very dry. Most creeks are dry and many of the shelters' water sources are dry. Other hikers have told us that there hasn't been much rain. We definitely prefer hiking in no rain, but it's affecting our hike plan! Out hiking plan was built on the assumption that making it to a shelter meant water...but now we know that is not true.So now we are being careful to take advantage of water sources close to shelters (when they exist!) that we might otherwise have skipped (thus carrying a lot of extra weight of water, in the last mile or so). Or, we're thinking, ""what if no water"" and preparing our minds (and poor feet) for the possibility of more miles or dry camps. Back to the hike...Once we reached the river, we followed it along periodically walking along its edge. Eventually we came to a road and left the AT to walk 0.5 miles to the town of Falls Village, where we'd planned a nice lunch at the Toymakers Cafe. (It has a reputation for being hiker-friendly.) Upon reaching the cafe, we learned that the wait for food would be 1.5 hours, as they were serving a huge motorcycle crowd. (They were part of ""Make a Wish"" and we're giving a ride to a very old woman who wanted to ride in a side car.) We were told that soup, chili, and waffles could be prepared faster, so we opted for the lunch of champions...chili and waffles. Weird lunch!!Back again on the trail, we climbed up to the falls of the Housatonic River, for which the village was named. The falls are pictured in the attached photo. At this point we left the Housatonic River for the last time...in Connecticut!! The trail continued on up and along a ridge on easy forest tread, with occasional great views of the farmland below. We've learned that if one side of a ridge is easy, the other side won't be...and it wasn't. The drop down was near-vertical, with a steep, rocky, narrow path, switch-backing tightly. At one point, the drop in the path was so great, we had to go down a ladder. When we reached the bottom, we continued to the highway, and walked roads on into Salisbury, our planned stop for a zero day. We arrived at Vanessa's house, in the middle of town, at 6:00PM. She showed us to our room and told us that the White Hart Inn was a good place to go for dinner. We showered and followed her advice. We enjoyed our dinner, headed back to Vanessa's, and hit the sack.","Sharon Mountain Campsite

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540224,"Day 13 - ET took advantage of the Zero Day and slept in until 7:45am... Spider was up earlier enjoying a change to read. Once up and dressed, the first order of business was to find a place for breakfast!! It turns out there was Bistro across the street that served a great breakfast, in our wandering to the Bistro we found the nearby Post Office, grocery store and General Store. Unlike our last Zero Day where we had to walk a mile or 2 for anything, everything we need is a block or 2 away!!After breakfast, we went to the Post Office and our box of food for the next week was there, Wahoo!! Also there was a package with a second battery for Spider\\'s phone. This will allow him to have enough power for the upcoming 8 days of hiking to continue to Journal.Then back to our room to make phone calls to friends and family and to relax. ET went and bought a shirt to be her 'clean' town shirt. By then it was time to eat again... so off to the Bistro we went!!After lunch we hit the grocery store and bought a few items to supplement our meals. For this next section...then back to our room. Pretty exciting day, Huh? But that is what we like to do after being on our feet over 10 hours each day for the last week.We relaxed some more, catching up on email and a few more phone calls. Then it was dinner time so we walked to White Hart hotel for another wonderful meal. On our walk there we spotted a couple hikers that are also staying at Vanessa's. Today they did the hike we plan on doing tomorrow. We quizzed them on quality of the trail and availability of water...this? is what the hiker community is all about.After dinner, we returned to our room and began to prepare for 8 days of hiking… Ugh!!Health and Wellness evaluation: Our original blisters seem to be healing, but Spider has a new on on his right foot.

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540821,"Day 14 - What's a ""Slackpack""? It's a hike with a pack that is slack because it is nearly empty. All it usually has in it is food and water. In hiker terms it's when you leave your gear somewhere?, then hike a section with just food and water. The key is having a way back to your gear!! Most use a shuttle service to do that. It turns out Vanessa, our hostess, runs a shuttle service...so we're slackpacking today!!We awoke at 5am and hit the trail at 5:20am. We walked the 0.7 miles back to the trail and soon were starting our first climb. It had rained last night (we were happy to be indoors not in our tent!!) and everything wa?s still wet. The branches we brushed against were drippy, the dirt on the trail was muddy and the rocks were slippery. Our first objective was to climb Bear Mountain, the highest point in Connecticut. The trail was in pretty good shape and made an approach that was only moderately steep until the very end where we had to walk up solid granite slabs. Only then did we realize how treacherous wet rocks can be. After slipping and almost doing a face-plant, we slowed way down and started looking for ways to avoid walking on rocks.We finally reached the top and we're able to see...Nothing! The clouds that had brought the previous night's rain were still around and we were in them. All we saw was grey! Oh well. So we started down. We found it was all slab granite and almost vertical!! So we inched our way down, holding to every tree, bush and rock.With much effort we made ?it down the mountain to a place where the AT became a normal trail again...Whew! Maybe this wasn't the best day to try to hike 18 miles!!Next we entered an area called Sage's Gulch. Unlike all the dry creekbeds we had crossed so far today, Sage's Gulch had a nicely running stream. What made this area so unique was the creek had formed grottos alon?g it's course with great swimming holes. If we weren't already behind schedule, we would have taken a dip!!The other thing that happened in Sage's Gulch was we left Connecticut and entered Massachusetts...another state completed!!When we left Sage's Gulch we began our climb of Race Mountain. As with Bear Mountain, the trail soon turned to a climb up granite slabs, but most were now dry so it made it a little easier. Near the top we had some views since the clouds had lifted a little. Unfortunately the slabs were still wet on our descent so we had to take it slow. Even with that, ET slipped and fell on one of the slabs. Fortunately nothing was damaged but her pride?!We finally made it to the bottom and started our climb of our third peak, Mt. Everett (no not Mt. Everest!). Once again a normal trail turned into a rock slab climb, but no drama because the rocks were mostly dry. Just a tough slog on tired legs. The descent was actually easy compared to the other 2 mountains.The last thing to tackle was Jug End. It was a 2 mile long ridge that abruptly ended. The AT followed the ridge and its undulations, many of short, steep hand over hand climbs or descents. What energy we had was pretty much used up on this stretch. Then we got to the end. The descent to the valley floor was near vertical!!Finally reaching the bottom, we had a mile walk to Highway 41. We arrived at 6:45pm...about a 13.5 hour day. We called Vanessa and she sent her son to pick us up. We arrived back at Vanessa's at about 7:45pm..Boy did that shower feel good!We went to the White Hart for dinner again and toasted our accomplishment.Major Milestones:1) Passed the 1500 mile mark of the AT (See the sign in the photo.)2) Longest miles hiked in a day at 18.23) Completed 10th state the AT goes through..only 4 to go!!","Home of Vanessa Breton, Salisbury, CT

It had rained overnight and we were happy to not be packing a wet tent. We'd arranged with Vanessa for a 6:00 AM shuttle back to Mass. 41 (road where we completed the hike from the day before). She dropped us off to begin our day's hike at 6:30.With our newly restocked and thus heavy packs, we enjoyed several miles of walking along fields and up and down small sections of forest lands. We also walked through many boggy sections on wooden planks, batting away mosquitos. Eventually we reached the Housatonic River again. (Its origin is Massachusetts.)After two hours, we began looking for a good breakfast stop. The corridors along the edges of the fields were too buggy, so we trudged along until we got to our bridge over the Housatonic. At its base was a perfect picnic spot, free of bugs. (No mosquitos in a flowing river.) It was sad to see a sign warning people/fisherman not to eat the fish, as they were loaded with PCB's.After almost 5 miles of near-flat striding, we finally had to begin our first climb for the day. We had left the Taconic Range yesterday when we descended Jug End (we had been in them through all of Connecticut) we are in the Berkshires now and generally higher in elevation. We've noticed more pine trees in the mix, plus more ferns and birches.The trail continued to include some rocky and rock-face challenges, but less often. We enjoyed the abundance of forest tread. The photo for the day shows a huge rock wall that we passed. Like some of the others we noticed in the last couple of days, it seemed incredibly fractured. We passed another set of ledges and very fractured rocks marked on the map, presumably for climbers.Our goal for the day was a shelter with a tenting area and spring. We arrived at 6:45PM and found most of the tenting area filled with a group of dads and young boys, maybe 10-12 years old. They made a lot of noise, but did quiet down at hiker's midnight - 9PM. On our zero day, Spider had put out a query on ""WhiteBlaze"" (online hiker forum to which he belongs). He asked about water at this shelter and was assured that it was still running. It was...a spring, hidden in some rocks. He used a scooper to get the water and his handkerchief to filter the water into our water bag. We treated it with iodine as usual.We set up camp and cooked dinner while more and more hikers came in. The shelter (which was actually two shelters with a privy between), also had a bear box, which was completely filled with everyone's food bags by the end of the evening.

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540823,"Day 16 - We allowed ourselves the luxury of sleeping in, with a planned 12 mile day. (Two weeks ago, that seemed tough. But after 18 then 15 mile days, it seemed short!).Up at 6:30 and out at 7:45, which included breakfast in camp. We were the last thru/section hikers out, but ahead of the boys and dads taking up most of the camp.The trail started out steeply, continuing the climb from the day before. After that, we enjoyed an easy walk with the extra pleasure of walking along a beaver-dammed pond shown in the attached photo.Eventually, we descended on long, sweeping switchbacks, on forest duff tread. What a treat! A thru-hiker-type jogged right on by.Interestingly, we came to a special area called the Tyringham Cobble Reserve. It had special rules posted that included no camping and no entering after dark. We wondered how many thru-hikers obey the rules. Who stops to read such long lists of rules anyway, besides ET?As we hiked along a valley, we encountered endless boggy areas with thick, wooden, raised planks for navigating. When we had to cross the valley, the planks turned into a long boardwalk, winding, rising, lowering, all quite high above the swamp. Mosquitos were a constant nuisance. Out came the Deet at our next break. We have been surprised by the amount of boggy areas we have encountered since entering Massachusetts.At end the day, we climbed a steep trail up to the top of the next ridge. (The trail so far in MA has undulated mostly between 1500-2000 feet in elevation.) We had planned to continue for another mile or so, seeking a spring that Spider had read about in his research. But after a half mile, we came across a running stream with a beautiful campsite nearby. We couldn't resist, even if it meant adding a mile to the next day's hike. We were going to stealth camp anyway.","Mt. Wilcox South Shelter

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540824,"Day 17 - We awoke at 5am but didn't get out until 6:30am because it was laundry morning. Since we are out for 7 days, we don't carry enough? things like socks and underwear for that many days… it would be too heavy. So we carry several pair and rinse them out along the way. You can always tell a long distant hiker by the laundry hanging from their packs to dry. That was Spider today!We started on a fairly rocky trail with short ups and downs. Spider felt something wasn't right with his pack, but toughed out for 2 hours until our first break. When he had a chance to closely examine his pack, he found the aluminum stays of the internal frame were coming loose allowing the pack to sag on Spider's shoulders. Now what?Being a former Boy Scout leader, Spider was prepared! He pulled out the small repair kit and used some wire to repair his pack. So what else is in the repair kit besides wire: Superglue, duct tape (of course) and large safety pins. Unfortunately, the repair lost us an hour, so now we needed to hustle. One of the interesting things we did today was cross over I-90 on a bridge specially built for the AT to cross the Interstate. The attached picture is of ET on the bridge.This freeway is like an old friend, much like I-80 was when last year when we crossed it at Delaware Water Gap, because both have a connection to the West Coast. We remember crossing I-90 at Snoqualamie Pass in Washington when we were hiking the PCT.Today's trail was a lot of small ups and downs, rocky or boggy. The more important thing was the skies, they were clouding up. The weather report 3 days ago was for rain tomorrow, but as the skies continued to darken, we suspected the forecast had changed. We made it to our destination shelter at 5:30pm. According to the other hikers already in the shelter, big rains were due overnight, so we opted to sleep in the shelter. At 6pm it started to rain.

Since we were sleeping in the loft, the noise was very close to us!! The rain was accompanied with rolls of thunder. Boy am I glad we decided to stay in the shelter!!?We awoke at 5:30am to a partly cloudy sky and temperatures in the high 50's, the coldest morning we have experienced so far. We tried to quietly move our gear to an area away from the shelter to not disturb the other occupants. We hit the trail at 6:30am.As with our previous outing after a rain, the rocks and roots were slippery. Fortunately we weren't going up or down mountains this time, but stayed fairly flat. However we still had to watch our step to keep from falling. In addition, a lot of the first part of the day was spent negotiating wooden planks over muddy, boggy area.After about 10 miles of bogs, we finally descended into the town of Dalton, MA. The plan was to eat a ""real"" lunch in town and pick up a few supplies and then continue on to our planned destination campsite. 1 hour and 45 minutes later we finally left Dalton! It was so nice to sit in an air conditioned pub and enjoy our eats and drinks! Spider has always called towns vortexes. They suck you in and it's hard to leave all that they offer.Once finally out of town, we started a 1000 foot climb to our campsite, on full stomachs!! Along the way we spotted the garter snake you see in the attached picture. Spider had seen several of these before. This one posed for his picture.We finally arrived at our campsite at 6:15pm...less than 12 hours to hike over 16 miles. We're getting better!!One of the people in camp was a Ridge Runner. These are people, hired by the state to travel in the back country, to monitor the trails and shelters. Massachusetts has 2 ridge runners. They are great information providers, so Spider was quizzing him on the water situation at the upcoming shelters we will be staying at.It stayed cool and blustery all day, so tonight may be our first cold night.Major Milestone: We passed 200 miles today, only 300 miles to go to finish this section","October Mountain Shelter

The previous evening we heard fireworks going off until 10pm so we were up a little later than ""hikers midnight"". Guess they celebrate the 4th of July for more than one day around here!It was a cold morning again and still windy, making it feel even colder. We had a slight climb to start the day that warmed us up a little, but after that it was all downhill. We made it to the town of Cheshire, MA by 8:45am and headed to the Dunkin' Donuts for breakfast. An hour later we waddled out and started our big climb for the day...2500 feet to the top of Mt. Greylock... our biggest single climb so far. This is ""training"" us for what is to come later in Vermont and New Hampshire! Fortunately there were only a few steep climbs. The rest were gradual ups.  Even so, it took us? about 6 hours to make the 8 miles to the top of Mt. Greylock. We noticed that as we climbed, we saw more and more pines and less of the deciduous hardwoods. By the time we reached the top, it was all pines. Mt Greylock is the highest point in Massachusetts. At the top is a huge tower as a war memorial. Next to it is Bascom Lodge, a lodge built by the CCC in the 1930's similar to the Timberline Lodge we stayed in on our PCT hike through Oregon. Spider had phoned yesterday and got us 2 bunks reserved in the ""bunkroom"" for tonight (unfortunately, no private rooms were available, holiday weekend and all). So we checked in at about 4pm and immediately hit the showers. As usual it felt sooo Good!? Afterwards we walked around outside and took the attached picture...This is what a clean hiker looks like: wearing his only clean shirt and his rain-pants!At 5pm sharp it was Happy Hour at the Lodge and guess who was first in line?  We then found a couple of rocking chairs in the lobby and enjoyed our drinks. Soon a guitar and fiddle duo started tuning up and began playing Irish, Canadian and New England tunes...not our usual night on the trail!!At 7pm sharp, the music ended and those ?of us with reservations moved to the dining room for a wonderful 3-course meal. We sat with 4 people who had driven up for just the dinner. We had great conversation over dinner. The dining room window gave a panoramic view to the valley below.

No one but us was up at 5:00AM. We hauled all of our gear downstairs and out to the picnic tables in front of the lodge and repacked everything for a new day.We took a few minutes to look at all the info plaques about the Lodge and the huge war memorial at the summit of Mt. Greylock, built in 1932. The memorial is being refurbished, as you can see from the photo. It's actually shaped like a pawn on a chess board.We got our earliest start to date...5:45AM. The trail leaving Mt. Greylock was hard on our knees and toes...3000 feet down. The last section coming down to the town at the bottom of the descent was newly rebuilt with switchbacks...a pleasant surprise! Then we immediately started a 2000 foot climb to get up onto the next ridge in line. This combo was a physical challenge! We took extra rest breaks, just stopping for a few minutesAlong the way, we chatted several times with a Ridge Runner volunteer who worked the holiday weekend at a popular shelter, educating new hikers. He said he had to tell one dad that a whole bottle of kitchen dish soap was inappropriate!We crossed the MA-VT line today. That point is also the southern terminus of the Long Trail. That trail goes straight north to Canada. It coincides with the AT until the AT turns east toward New Hampshire on about 100 miles. We met a number of hikers doing the Long Trail, including one very young man...maybe 14 years old...whose parents walked him in and sent him off. They told us that they would be meeting and re-supplying him along the way. We were impressed that they were letting him go all by himself.We arrived at our destination shelter at 5:15. It's 7 miles into Vermont and was packed full with tenters. Some looked more like Fourth of July celebrants. We heard ATV's and gun shots for several hours.

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541022,"Day 21 - We awoke at 5:20am and hit the trail at 6:15am. We were the first out of the masses of people staying at the shelter. We started our first climb almost immediately. We are finding that there was no change in the trail (yet!!) from what we had in Massachusetts...rocky, rooty and boggy. An example is shown in the attached picture. The problem is you have to watch every step and that slows us down.One group of young thru-hikers passed us by like we were standing still, but other than them there aren't many thru-hikers around. After passing by several boggy ponds we began a steep 1000 ft drop to Vermont Highway 9. Our plan was to call a taxi to get into Bennington VT where we had a motel reservation. However, we'd been having problems getting cell service recently so as we began to descend, we started checking our phones for cell coverage...there was none!! So then what? We could hike the 5+ miles to town or we could try hitchhiking to town or we could ""yogi"" a ride to town. ""Yogi"" is a term we learned on the PCT. It basically means to get something we need without asking for it. The genesis of the term is uncertain but is most likely comes either from Yogi Bear conning picnicers out of their food baskets or from a thru-hiker whose trailname was ""Yogi"" who was particularly talented in getting what she needed from perfect strangers without asking.We started to yogi midway through our steep 1000 foot descent when we met 2 day-hikers coming up. The descent was on narrow steps of random granite blocks set into the mountain side. It was so narrow that when we met the day-hikers one of us had to step aside to let the others pass. In doing so, we exchanged pleasantries and got the inevitable question ""Are you thru-hiking the AT?"". Spider gave the usual description of our 500 mile section hike but added to the end that we were getting off the trail in Bennington for a day of rest but were having problems getting cell service to call a taxi. What would most people do in this situation? Offer us a ride... and they did. They said if were still in the trail-head parking lot when they returned from their short hike, they would take us to Bennington. Notice we never asked, so it comes across as their idea...that's a ""Yogi""When we got to the trailhead parking lot at 2:45pm, the young thru-hikers who had passed us were all there enjoying some Trail Magic in the form of soft drinks and cookies left by a Trail Angel. Also a lady stepped out of a motor-home and handed Spider a Klondike ice cream bar. Wow!As we rested eating our treats, the Trail Angel showed up to retrieve his ice chest. Of course we talked about our hike and Spider happened to mention our cell phone dilemma. The Trail Angel offered to give us a ride to town… a double Yogi day!!On our drive to and through Bennington, our Trail Angel, Steve, pointed out various eating spots. We also discovered that we had meet a thru-hiker several years ago, trailname Don's Brother, who was a friend of Steve's...small world!!Steve dropped us off at our motel at about 3:30pm. As ET showered, Spider walked 5 blocks to the Post Office and picked up our resupply box. Thanks Sally! Upon his return, Spider had his shower then we relaxed in our air conditioned, bug-free room… Ahhhh!!Dinner was at a local microbrew pub… sure tasted better than freeze-dried!!Major Milestone: We passed the 1600 mile mark in our hike of the AT","Seth Warner Shelter

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541853,"Day 22 - ?We slept well last night, after a long week of hiking and going to bed, looking forward to our day off. Of course breakfast was .75 miles away in a diner, highly recommended by our Trail Angel driver, the day before. It was The Blue Benn, a real diner car, built in the 1940's. Every table had a selection devise which, for a quarter got you two songs from the 1950's, played on the big juke box. Someone at a neighboring table put it to use. The attached photo shows how it looks inside. The food was excellent too.We spent the day doing our usual chores...getting laundry done, repacking our packs from our re-supply box, shopping for other needed replacements, re-spraying our clothes with Permethrin (tick repellent) which we sent to ourselves in our re-supply box, catching up with family by phone, etc. Spider spent time further repairing his pack, to ensure that it lasts another 250 miles. He also called a taxi to get a 6:00AM pick-up tomorrow, to get us back to the trail (5 miles out of town).For dinner, we walked back into town to eat at Ramunto's Pizza Pub. We'd heard it was popular with hikers, but our experience was that it was popular with families. We enjoyed our dinners...really carbed up for the next week of hiking!Now that we are in Vermont, we're in the Green Mountains, still part of the Appalachians. We've noticed from the maps that we are moving into greater elevations, and bigger climbs and descents. We've also noticed from the maps that there is a whole lot less of anything else like roads and towns. Lastly, we've noticed a lot less AT&T cell reception. Our journal entries may be bunched a bit more, than before, as we send multiple entries from a mountain top where we finally get cell service.So the physical assessment is similar to the last Zero Day. We both have healing blisters on our feet. ET has new blister under her right big toe that appeared 2 days ago. Her hope is that the Zero Day will let it heal some. Spider has been nursing a burst blister all week. It happened on our 18 mile day last week. We got some New Skin Liquid Bandage today that he hopes will do the trick for the upcoming week's hike. This is the first year we have had blisters this late into our hike. Our knees seem to be holding up okay, but long and or very steep downhills are not their friends! Overall we feel much stronger, particularly going uphill. Hopefully another week of ""training"" will have us ready for the higher, steeper mountains of northern Vermont and New Hampshire.","Catamount Motel, Bennington VT

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541854,"Day 23 - We awoke at 5:15am and were ready to go at 6am when the taxi arrived. It was a quick run up to the pass where we had left the AT 2 days ago. We hit the trail a 6:15am and, as usual, we had a climb out of the pass. Fortunately it wasn't as steep as the steps/trail we had come down to get to the pass. We had a fairly quick 1200 foot climb then it was a series of ups and down but with a gradual increase in elevation. In the attached picture, you can see the view from a viewpoint...looking out on the thick forest. By our third break we had done most our climbing for the day and reached Goddard Shelter.A little about how we use breaks during hiking. When we start out a long distance hike, we usually take a break every hour for about 20 minutes. We take our boots off to let our socks dry and eat a little something. After about 2 weeks we move the breaks to every 1.5 hours and by week 4 we are to every 2 hours. Usually when it's time for a break, we find a convenient rock or tree to lean up against near the trail.So for our third break today, it was unusual to be taking a break at a shelter. However, it turned out to be fortuitous because half-way through our lunch a rain squall came through and the skies opened up for about 30 minutes. Once it passed, we hit the trail again, but by then it was flooded in many areas and the rocks and roots were slippery.We completed our 2400 foot climb and began our 4 mile descent to our destination tent site, arriving at 5:30pm. Even there was a forecast for a chance of thunderstorms, we decided to roll the dice and stay in our tent instead of the nearby shelter. Well, we lost...as I am typing this, it is pouring rain outside with lots of thunder and lightning. Oh Well!!Today was hump day in a couple of ways: 1) We passed the 250 mile mark of our 500 hike and 2) We have hiked 19 days before this day and we have planned 19 days of hiking after today to finish this hike.Major Milestone: We've hiked 250 miles… only 250 to go!!","Catamount Motel, Bennington VT

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541856,"Day 24 - We awoke at 5:15am. A little water from the previous night's thunderstorms had leaked under the tent but nothing was very wet… a testament to our 3-season tent. We packed up the wet tent and hit the trail at 6:30am. We started our first climb of the day immediately.As usual after a rain, we had to talk it slow because of the wet rocks and roots...only now there were also standing water in the middle of the trail where there used to be soil. If you step in these you find the soil has liquefied and the mud comes half-way up your boot...so we try to walk around these mini-bogs.Once the first climb was over, it was a fairly level trail. Ever since the Long Trail began, we have been seeing a lot more hikers on the trail and in the shelters/tent areas. Watching them reminds us of the people at the beginning of the AT...big packs, blisters and learning their gear.Just before our last climb of the day, Trail Magic!! The same guy that was at the trailhead near Bennington giving out Klondike bars, was at a trailhead before Stratton Mountain giving out ice cream sandwiches...gotta' love this guy!!The climb up Stratton Mountain was long 1800 foot climb, but our egos were helped when we passed a couple of Long Trail hikers!! Once finally at the top, we found the fire tower in the attached picture. The views were supposed to be great from the top, but we were trying to get to the shelter before the predicted rainstorms...so down we went!!We arrived at the shelter at 5:45pm. With the predicted rain, we decided to stay in the shelter. This shelter is one of the few, so far, where there is a caretaker and he charges $5/person to stay in the shelter. Not sure what we got for this fee...Nothing was different from any of the ""free"" shelters we have stayed at!!","Kaughnawaga Tent Site

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541859,"Day 25 - Good thing we sheltered last night! The skies opened up and it poured from midnight to 6am. When we woke at 5am and heard the rain, we thought ""Oh no!!"" This is the kind of day where we would prefer to be in our easy chairs with a cup of coffee and a good book watching the rain… but that is not the lot of a hiker We got a later start, as usual in a shelter...left at 6:50am. Fortunately our procrastination paid off because it had stopped raining. We were dressed for rain with rain jackets and pack covers. Fortunately, the rain held off until we were just about done with breakfast for our first hiking break...about 9:15am.Right after we started down the trail, we saw Stratton Pond, for which that shelter was named. It was beautiful in the morning with mist rising from the water. That's our photo for the day.The trail was an easy one today, with few serious ups and downs. Instead, we were challenged by flooded trails with gushy, muddy sections and deeper streams, due to the previous two nights of rain and the steady rain that started up again around noon.We were glad to find bunk space at our next destination shelter. We even gave up an opportunity to walk down a highway we crossed, for real food in a restaurant. Spider had discovered its availability in his pre-hike research and we were carrying one less lunch because of it. But we were determined to get to the shelter as early as possible to ensure our spots. (We agreed to make up that missing lunch on our last hiking day of this week, when we have a short hike to our next rest/zero day location and can eat a great lunch in town.)So what happens when we arrive at a shelter dripping wet? First, we determine where we'll bunk. Usually, it's the loft, as we're often late arrivers. (Most hikers prefer the bunks on the main floor.) Then we unpack our packs to the side and find a peg or nail from which to hang our wet packs. Spider usually strings a clothesline, for hanging our dripping clothes after we've changed into dry clothes. We use our tent ground cloth to keep our sleeping pads, sleeping bags and blow-up pillows off the loft floor. Lastly, we take our stove, cups and spoons, water bottles and food in our Ursacks (bear-proof) bags down to the cooking table (usually under the front overhang of the shelter), for dinner later.Spider usually fills our big water bag at the shelter's water source (spring or creek nearby). We treat the water with Iodine and then use the water for dinner that night and for filling our water bottles for the next day's hike. Today, Spider got soaked getting water.   The thunder was booming and the rain pouring as he rushed back from filling the water bag!The rain today is from a front moving in, as compared to thundershowers that we'd previously experienced. With it has come much colder temperatures. We're finally getting to use some of the cold weather clothing we've been lugging with us all this time. We hardly sweat at all today!","Stratton Pond Shelter

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541860,"Day 26 - We awoke at 5:15am to rain… Darn!! It had rained all night. (It's easy to tell, when we are sleeping under a metal roof!) So on with the rain gear. We hit the trail at 6:40am and started to climb up the 700 feet of Bromley Peak. At the very top, what do we find? The ski lift in the attached picture. We hadn't realized that the open trail we were walking up was a ski run.?After Bromley Peak came Styles Peak, Peru Peak and Baker Peak… a 4 peak day in the rain… because it rained on and off all day. All the peaks were normal climbs except Baker. It was a solid rock scramble in the pouring rain. Every step was a potential slip. We were glad when that was over. The trail was full of water/mud holes...some of them over 3 inches deep. So it was more of a dance? down the trail than a hike. In some particularly boggy areas, trail maintenance folk had nailed long 2X8 boards onto cross beams to make a board walkway above the mud. The problem is that these boards are like ice when wet… just another challenge!!One thing about hiking in the rain is that it's not easy to plop down next to the trail for a break. For our breakfast break today we tied up our tent ground cloth (a waterproof sheet that goes under the tent to prevent ground moisture seeping up into the tent) to 4 trees as a canopy to sit under. Another break was at a shelter we were passing by. But in general we minimize the number of breaks on rainy days. Today we only took 3 breaks where on a sunny day it would have been 4 or 5.We arrived at our destination shelter at 5:25pm. With all the hikers that had passed us during the day, we figured there was a good chance the shelter would be full by the time we got there, but as luck would have there was only one person there. The forecast is for clearing weather tonight...we sure hope so!! ?We are falling asleep to the thunder of water rushing down Ten Kilns Brook as it drains the mountains just outside our shelter. ""Brook"" implies a little 3 feet wide trickle of water… This ""brook"" is 30 feet wide and a roaring torrent.","Bromley Shelter

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541986,"Day 27 - I'm happy to report that there was no more rain last night and we awoke to clear skies!! We hit the trail at 6:25am and start our steady climb of 1100 feet to White Rocks Peak. The trail was very wet and muddy. In some cases a stream was running down the trail. It was cool morning… just right for hiking.For a change we didn't ? have to immediately climb a mountain! Instead, we had slight ups and downs. We had our breakfast break at beautiful Little Rock Pond. We followed the outflow to the Pond, along the way we passed 2 defunct beaver ponds.Soon we started our first climb of the day, 800 feet up White Rocks Mountain. With a name like that we expected a rock scramble somewhere along the way...but nothing materialized.After getting off White Rocks Mountain, we immediately began the 1200 foot climb of Bear Mountain. It think this is third ""Bear Mountain"" we have climbed this trip. Every state seems to have one.After Bear Mountain we followed a ridge where at one point we came to an outlook and had a panoramic view of the countryside, including a view of the Rutland, VT airport.After dropping off the ridge we crossed the Mill River on suspension bridge. This is what created Claredon Gorge..?. which is today's picture and the photo on the map we're using!After the Gorge we were feeling pretty good. We only had 1 mile to our destination shelter and it was only 6pm... on the largest mileage day we have had on this trip. The map showed a steady climb to the shelter. Unfortunately what had was an almost vertical climb up a 500 foot climb up a rock fall. Not what you want to see at the end of a long day!It took us 1.5 hours to go the last mile. We finally drug ourselves into the shelter tenting area at 7:30pm completely bushed. But camp duties had to be done! So as ET set up the tent, Spider got water for the next day.

And today we climbed Killington Peak...about a 2500 foot climb.It felt great to sleep in our tent last night. The ""bed"" was more comfortable...our pads on leaves instead of the wood boards of shelters for the last three nights. It was dark and quiet and we both slept well. The tent also got aired out and dried after being stowed wet in the tent sack for several days.We started the day with a steep, 500 foot climb. That seems to be the norm...every shelter where we sleep-in or tent-by seems to be down from some high point and below the next high point. Then we roller-coasted awhile, before starting the 7-mile ascent of Killington. Parts of the trail were nice forest paths and others, rocky, rooty, hands-and-feet climbs...another norm. Thank goodness for the easy sections where we get close to 2 miles per hour of hiking. The steep ones are more like 1 mph.We seldom take any side trails to vista points, but one exception ET made was to go just 100 yards off the trail to capture a photo of Killington Peak. The photo was taken around 10am and we reached almost to the peak on the trail at 4pm. (Another side trail, which we ignored, took you to the peak - a ski area concessions area.)We got in at 6:30 pm... 12 hours from when we started, with 4 half-hour breaks. The shelter where we finished for the day is old, small and has only one campsite. About 6 other tenters, including us are squeezing in somewhere. We created our own campsite in a totally new area on fresh, though wet leaves.","Claredon Shelter

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542660,"Day 29 - We awoke at 5:20am. Knowing this was going to be a short day made us a little slow and lazy. On the other hand we wanted to get some things done in town...so we got going!! Finally hit the trail at 6:40am. The trail had several short ups and downs. One down was into a small valley where there were lots of downed trees. We finally realized the trees were all laying the same direction. We were in an avalanche zone!!We finally descended to highway crossing. That's a difference in the AT vs PCT… the AT has lots of road crossings that are major roads. There are no special accommodations made for these crossings except a hiker crossing sign on the highway warning drivers...except I swear it means ""accelerate"" to them!! So we stand on the side of the road moving our heads like an observer in a tennis match, then when a gap in traffic appears it's ""Run Forest, Run"" to get across!!After crossing the highway, we had a short climb to Willard Gap and Maine Junction. This where the Long Trail leaves the AT and heads north to the Canadian border. That is where today's picture was taken. We chose to make this our breakfast break. As we sat there, several of the Long Trail hikers we had met and shared shelters with this last week, came up the trail. We said our good-byes as they made the turn north.After breakfast we had a short climb then descent to VT100. This is where we left the AT and headed up the road for a quarter mile to a condo complex. It turns out a friend of Spider's in the retired men's group he belongs to had a daughter and son-in-law that own a condo in this complex and had offer it to us for our Zero Day..we accepted...Thanks Larry and Leigh!!We arrived at the condo at 11:30am where we left boots outside (they really smell!!) and tiptoed inside and took a shower...Boy did we need that!! Then we rummaged through our packs to find a set of clothes that were clean enough and presentable enough to be seen in public. Then off to run our errands in town… which is about 0.5 miles away.First order of business is to eat!! We did a brief cross-country walk through the forest out the back door of the condo to nearby Kent Pond where we returned to the AT. We followed it for a quarter of a mile to Meadow Lodge to have lunch. Unfortunately they weren't serving lunch… so Plan B… the nearby deli!!However on the way was the outfitter. As has been mentioned in several of our Journal entries, Spider has been doing repairs on his pack at various points along the way over the last week. It turns out the entire internal support structure of his pack had failed. The result had been that the last couple of days have been difficult for Spider...a lot of pack weight on his shoulders because the hipbelt can only carry a small portion of the weight and an unbalanced pack whose weight easily cause added stress to his back. ET took on carrying the tent to take some of the weight off Spider's shoulders. So it was time for a new pack!!Fortunately, the outfitter had a pack that seemed to fit Spider and was willing to send the old pack back to our home in California (So on our return home, Spider can deal with REI about their pack!!). Unfortunately the outfitter could not help in the repair of Spider's trekking pole hand straps. Spider will need to figure out something for those on his own. The AT is taking its toll on Spider's gear!!While Spider was getting fitted for a pack, ET went next door to the Visitor's Center to find out what dining options were around the area. She found that there was a local bus that could get us around the area for $2 apiece.Finally we made it to the deli at 2:30pm and got lunch. It turned out that the shop was a deli, grocery store and liquor store… nirvana!! Since we had all the comforts of home at our disposal, we decided to make tomorrow a true ""Veg"" day by purchasing the food we needed for most our stay. We had the convenience of a new backpack to carry it all back to the condo!!While we waited for our deli sandwiches, ET went next door to Post Office and picked up our resupply box... Thanks Sally!! The box also went into the new backpack… Now the true test. Spider put on the backpack that probably weighed 50-60 pounds, then walk 0.25 miles to the condo. The pack worked great!!We cooked frozen pizza, downed it with wine and beer and finished it off with Ben and Jerry's ice cream. Life is good!!Major Milestone: We passed 1700 miles on the AT today. Ironically, someone had laid out a bed of green leaves on a flat stone on the trail and used sticks to form ""1700"". So all the thru-hikers knew they had passed the 1700 mile mark!!","Churchill Scott Shelter

However it was great to enjoy our coffee, pastries and OJ in the comfort of easy chairs. As I have said before, that's what hiking does for us: makes us appreciate the things we could easily take for granted.Spider has been having more trouble with his knees this last week. Some of it was probably caused by his old pack, but some of it is an ongoing issue. So Spider decided to take the local bus into nearby Rutland, VT to upgrade his knee braces. After a relaxing couple of hours, Spider took off for the bus. The bus arrived on time and Spider discovered that seniors ride for 1 dollar… you gotta' love it!! 30 minutes later Spider was in downtown Rutland. He visited 4 pharmacies before finding what he wanted. Meanwhile, ET packed up a few things we've decided to send back home and took them to the Post Office. She also stopped by the deli and picked up more food!!The afternoon was spent relaxing, talking to family and Spider catching up on golf on TV. ? The attached picture is of the condo. We really liked the way it was set up.While watching the weather forecast, we saw that heavy-duty thunderstorms are predicted for late afternoon/early evening. That, coupled with the amount of food we still have left (hungry people should not shop for food!!) we decided to not go out for dinner. Good thing, because at about 5pm the skies opened up. Glad we're not on the trail. Fortunately the forecast looks better for the next couple of days, as we get back on the trail.Our physical condition is good in some ways and worse in others. ET is feeling much stronger and her knees only complain ever so often. She has one new blister but all the others have healed. She has a skinned up shin from a fall but it is healing. As mentioned, Spider is having knee problems especially his weak right. His plan is to use the new knee braces and Advil to make it through the remaining 2 weeks. We'll see!! Spider tweaked his back because of the problems with his old pack. The new pack seems to support his back much better, so hopefully it can heal.

We finally hit the trail at 6:30am.We cut down through the forest to the AT that was only 100 feet away. It was a fairly level trail, albeit rocky, until we dropped down to Thundering Falls, today's picture. We then followed a boardwalk through a marsh to a road and parking lot. Apparently, this was all set up for wheel access to the falls.Right after that we began our 1300 foot climb of Quimby Mountain. Later, we had 800, 500, 600 and 300 foot climbs...a big up and down day. At one point we took a short side trail to a no-longer-used shelter (because there is no water!). On top of the shelter was a platform with a ladder to it. From the platform you could see forever!We saw a lot more thru-hikers. At least 8-10 passed us today. So a ""bubble"" of hikers must have caught up to us. We are also starting to see more thru-hikers who started in Maine and are hiking south on the AT...they are called ""South-bounders"".Spider loves his new pack. He hardly knows it's there...and best yet it doesn't aggravate the back muscles he strained trying to live with the old pack. Unfortunately, the new leg braces have only marginally helped Spider's knee issues. His right knee hurts on the downhills and his left knee gives him shooting pains if tries to step up more than 3-4 inches high on the uphills. The only time he is pain free in on level trail...and the AT trail planners haven't included much of that!!

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542663,"Day 32: The shelter and tent camping area were packed last night. As we said in the last entry, the thru-hiking bubble has caught up with us!! We felt bad about making the first early noises, though not so bad when we were the 4th and 5th people leaving, at 6:40am.The trail started out with a short climb before it made a roller coaster descent. 4 climbs of significance today ranging from 400 to 700 feet.What was nice and different, was all the farms we saw and all the grass hay fields we walked along the edges. Today's photo shows one of them. We even topped some hills, covered in weeds, instead of forest and got fantastic views.In one case, we could see back to tall, conical Killington Peak, which we climbed to near the top, several days ago. It still amazes us how far we go in a day just hiking.A special treat for us later in the afternoon was ice cream and root beer! At one of the road crossings was a sign inviting hikers to walk up .2 mile to Cloudland Farm market/restaurant. Three other hikers were there when we got there. We bought our treats and sat out on the porch, enjoying the chairs and sunshine.We finally arrived at our destination shelter at 6:35pm. It is not as crowded as last nights.Spider did okay today but still issues with his knees left him struggling to keep up with ET. Resituating braces on his left knee allowed him to go reasonably pain-free as long as he didn't raise the foot higher than 3 inches. Fortunately today's trail didn't require that. However no adjusting of braces could solve the downhill issues with the right knee. While typing this, it aches and is slightly swollen. It may need a doctor's attention.","Wintturi Shelter

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542664,"Day 33: Spider finally cried ""Uncle"" and we have ended our hike for this year. His right knee is progressively hurting more and he doesn't want to do any permanent damage (presuming he hasn't already!!). Also looking ahead on the trail, there are some steep ups and downs coming up in the next couple of days: 1200 feet Holts Ledges, 2400 feet Smarts Mountain and 3700 feet Mt. Moosilauke. Neither knee would probably do well based on their current condition. The other advantage of stopping now is that the AT in traversing a major urban area with the associated transportation services that can get us to an airport so we can fly home. Hanover, NH is just across the Connecticut River from where we are now and is the home to Dartmouth College....so lots of services around.Back to the trail...Our beautiful nighttime was interrupted by rumblings of thunder from a thunderstorm that rolled in at 1:00am and lasted until 6:00am. That meant both of us jumping up and out of the tent to finish setting up the rain fly. We normally prefer to sleep in the tent without the rain fly. Our tent has ""windows"" (just netting, rather than tent material) on four sides. It offers great views, in all directions. But, because rain is a constant concern, we usually put the rain fly on top neatly arranged for quick completion. We just hook it to the frame on top, stake it down at the head end and leave the stakes handy. So last night, we put just-in-case into practice: pulled the rain fly over and staked out the four sides, so that the rain, rolled off and away from the tent. We finished the faintly set up and jumped back inside just before the first squall hit. The only consequences of rain in the morning is we have to pack our bags in the tent vestibules (tight quarters) and have to pack and carry a wet tent.Our trail to start was mostly downhill for a change, to the White River. We started hiking at 6:50am and enjoyed our usual breakfast on the trail to blue skies. Along the way, we hiked through and topped hills of open meadows, like we have the last few days. We noticed lots more wildflowers blooming, like the huge patch of Black-eyed Susan's, shown in our photo for today.Once we made it down, then of course we had to hike up and over another mountain (1000 ft. climb and descent) to the Connecticut River. We told ourselves that if we made it to the Happy Hill Shelter at mile 8.8 by 3:00pm, then we would call for a hotel room reservation and continue to Norwich. (Spider was hiking at 3/4 speed!) We made it by 1:45, so on we went.We arrived at the Norwich Inn at 5:15pm. It was just .25 mile off the AT and .9 miles to the Connecticut River, which forms the boundary between Vermont and New Hampshire. We plan to walk that .9 miles tomorrow, so we can finish our fourth state in this year's section hike, about 375 miles and 3/4 of our planned hike.We will spend the next day or so figuring out how to get home and make the appropriate reservations.

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542926,"Day 34: We awoke at 5am (habits die hard!!). Having Wifi, we explored the various options for getting home. We also tried to figure out what to do about the 2 boxes for resupply that were sent ahead that we will now not use. The second box actually has clothes in it for our flight home...Hmmm!! We finally decided to rent a car and drive to Pinkhams Notch, our planned ending point before ""knee-agedon"", and retrieve our box. Then drive to Newark airport. Why all the way to Newark, NJ?...We wanted to use frequent flyer miles on United and saw Newark had a lot more options than any other airports. So with the decisions made, we made car reservations for pickup tomorrow, hotel reservations at Newark airport and plane reservations for Wednesday.Next we hit the continental breakfast at the hotel, then walked next door to a place called Dan and Whits. It's a grocery, hardware, gift store and more kind of place. I'm sure if I looked hard enough I would have found a kitchen sink!! Our AT book said the place had fuel canisters so we wanted to check it out in preparation for our return to AT next year (how's that for positive thinking?).Next we checked out the local bus stop where a schedule and route of the free local bus to plan our day. Then to the Post Office to explore our options for the remaining box sitting at the North Woodstock Post Office. Turns out all we have to do is give them a call and ask that the box be returned to sender, which we later did.We were finally ready to accomplish our goal for the day...finish our hike of Vermont. With no packs and Spider wearing a brace on his right knee, we headed back to the AT. The AT stayed on the city streets of Norwich, VT down to a bridge across the Connecticut River, where half-way across we entered a New Hampshire marker. We continued on another 0.6 miles to downtown Hanover, NH. We figured out the location of the Enterprise Car Rental office where we would pick up our car tomorrow. Then off to eat lunch at a local bistro. We still have ""hiker hunger"", but need to start dialing back the calorie intake to enjoy the benefits of our ""AT Diet Plan""!!We sat next to the window in the restaurant and watch the high activity of a college town walk by outside as we ate lunch. (Hanover is home to Dartmouth.) We then walked a block and caught the free bus back to Norwich. We will use this same bus system next year to return to Hanover, to continue our AT hike.Back at the Norwich Inn it was time to relax and enjoy our ""Nero"" (Nearly Zero miles hiked on the AT) day. The Norwich Inn is an interesting place. It is old stage coach stop built in 1797. It's been added to over the years. We are staying in one of the newer buildings. In the original building is a pub and restaurant where we ate dinner last night. They also have a brewery on site.Spider got his golf fix by watching the replay of the British Open. Then we both sorted through our packs, throwing away the things we don't need to haul home, then repacked our packs for an airplane flight. At 6:30pm we headed to the Inn's pub for dinner and libations.Tomorrow the getting home adventure begins!!","Norwich Inn, Norwich, VT

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542928,"Day 34+1 - ?We finally got moving at 6am. We finished the last of our packing...amazing how much we spread out in a hotel room if we spend a couple of days there!! Today's picture is of the Norwich Inn. We went to the Inn's continental breakfast when it opened at 7am. Then back to the room to grab a couple of things and out to the bus stop to catch the 8:07am free bus back to Hanover, NH.We picked up our rental car in Hanover, returned to the Inn, packed the car, checked out and hit the road by 8:45am. We headed north on I-91 with partly sunny skies. Our hope was to get a look at the mountains we would be hiking next year as we drove northeast, but clouds hung low covering the mountain tops. As we made the final turn about 2 hours later and headed up into the mountains toward our destination of Pinkhams Notch, the weather transitioned from mostly sunny to light rain. Nearby Mt. Washington truly generates its own weather.We went to the Visitor Center and picked up the box we had sent with our clean traveling-home clothes. So now we had officially ""unwound"" ourselves from this hike...time to head home!!So back on the road heading south. We retraced our route driving by Norwich, VT where we had started 4.5 hours earlier. Our strategy in getting to Newark Airport was to head south until we started hitting the major populated areas, then head west far enough so that we could approach Newark from the west and be counter-commute (since we would hit this area during commute hours). The plan worked pretty well...until we hit stopped traffic on I-87 about 90 miles from Newark. It turned out that a crane had collapsed on the Tappan Zee Bridge where I-87 crosses the Hudson River and blocked ALL lanes going east. The result was a traffic jam of colossal ?magnitude...and we were in it!! Ironically we only had about 5 miles to go before we exited I-87 for another freeway, but it took us 1.5 hours to travel that 5 miles.The result was that we didn't get to our hotel until 8:30pm...a long day!!...and we still needed to drop off the rental car!!? So, we unpacked the car and Spider headed out to drop off the car at the nearby airport. Through a combination of a maze of highways with poor signage, closed gas stations, confusing signage, Spider's unfamiliarity with Newark Airport and slow hotel shuttle service, Spider did not get back to the hotel until 10pm. With the hotel's restaurant getting ready to shut down, ET order burgers as take-out.So finished our day with a romantic dinner of burgers and fries in our room at 10:30pm...then to bed. Tomorrow we fly home!!","Norwich Inn, Norwich, VT

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543149,"Day 34+2 - We awoke at 6am, packed up and headed to the lobby to catch the 7am shuttle to the airport. There were about 20 people waiting for the shuttle..and the shuttle only handles about 12 people!!. Fortunately part of the group was a large Indian family who elected to wait for the next shuttle...so we got on.Arrived at the airport about 15 minutes later. We used our United miles to book business class seats, since that is what is available and this also gives Spider more leg room to stretch out the beat up knees. Of course this also made check-in much faster, as there were no lines. By 8am we were at our gate.After some coffee and a pastry, we settled in for the wait for our plane. It arrived on time and we got to board early. It turned out that his was a plane set up for international flights, since it was continuing on to New Zealand after its stop in San Francisco. So our seats were small pods with individual TV screens, upgraded headsets and fully reclining seats. Spider loved the leg room and the power foot rests that supported his knees.Our flight left on time and was uneventful. We both took advantage of the free libations by starting with mimosas!! The lunch meal was outstanding (particularly when compared to freeze-dried meals!!) and we both had a chance watch a movie we had been hearing about. We landed at SFO at about 1:20pm.Our packs were one of the first items off the conveyor belt, so we got jump on the crowd and headed to BART. We were picked up at our local BART station by our daughter-in-law...Thanks, Kate!!...and we arrived home at 3:30pm. It's nice to be home!!","Howard Johnsons, Newark, NJ

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543797,"Day 34+7 – We have been home for 6 days and have started to fill our calendar. We have also reflected on our AT hike and find it a mixture of joy and pain. It was certainly much harder than we had expected, based on the sections from Georgia we have already hiked….and we haven’t even tackled New Hampshire yet. We will have to take that into consideration as we plan next year’s hike. We loved the people we met, the trail magic and the views (when we had them!!). We also enjoyed the physical shape we worked ourselves into. We didn’t like the rain, the steep, slippery rocks and roots, or the mud.We arrived home to find the ET had lost 8.5 lbs and Spider had lost 14 lbs….the AT Diet Plan worked!! We kept track of how many times we fell…a slip down to one knee doesn’t count, but a fall landing on your butt or back does. ET won this one, falling only 4 times in 4.5 weeks, where Spider fell 5 times.We evaluated what we took along and will probably make some changes. We brought a tarp that we sent home after 3 weeks. We had some clothing that we decided we could do without…the continued quest to reduce the weight of our packs!! We never had a chance to test our colder weather gear selections, so probably won’t make any changes there.Spider went to the doctor the day after we got home. The results of X-rays show that he has mild arthritis in both knees and suffers from bursitis and inflammation due to overuse…no permanent damage. So he is now on mega-doses of Ibuprofen to knock the inflammation down. The left knee is already pretty much back to normal. The pain still persists in his right knee.So that’s it for this year. The plan is to be back next year and hike 200-250 miles of the AT, focusing on shorter miles each day to save the knees and ENJOY the challenge!!",,Home,"Jul 25, Mon",0
