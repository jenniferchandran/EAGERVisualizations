I don't have an eye for white blazes just yet.Skinny hiker with fast-packer kit and a selfie gadget on his pole hurried by me going the other direction; then I passed some sightseers as I dieseled up the hill. This should be an interesting highway of nature and humanity.Peaceful rock with a million dollar view at Blood Mountain. Several others are quietly eating their lunch or speaking in hush tones. The shelter is beautifully rustic, clean, and oddly inviting for a 2 room shelter with open windows.One hiking pole allows me quick movement, but already a few stumbling moments on the down hill.",,Blood Mountain Out/In,"Sep 02, Wed",4.20

The top is peaceful, sitting up on the Brasstown Bald summit complex and munching. Descent to the Brasstown Bald parking lot was steep and paved, fairly easy on the knees and I just rolled back onto the trail for home. 5 hours (ascent-lunch-descent).

But you have to work for it...Brasstown Bald summit complex is a comfortable stop, as I sit down to refuel. A group of other hikers have come by way of Arkaquah Trail and will be heading down to Young Harris. The social aspects of trekking are apparent with this group -- but as the stragglers merrily join the others and break out their snacks and magic potions, I'm content with a more quiet event.Two poles are now part of my rolling kit. They saved me from a slip and fall and hopefully anymore ankle twists that always seem to be part of the AT downhill sections. Perhaps I'm becoming more trail savvy as well as I do feel more secure with every step. ~15 miles: 5 hours 30 minutes (ascent-lunch-descent) starting at the Church parking lot.
