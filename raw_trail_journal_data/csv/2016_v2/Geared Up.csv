As we are front runners, we find where there is and isnt water. 5 liters coming out of town! Soooooo heavy. Finally we left the desert wastelands. Scrub tree forest and mountains. Definitely more my style. We met a cyclist doing here own long distance course. Fantastic. A quick trip around an abandon mine. Always fun, no treasure to be had though.

Turns out road walking. Half the day atleast. The miles do go fast that way. We met a local man named Glen. Topped off our water and expressed how he wants to do the trail. I wish him the best of luck. After our roads ran out , we found a new kind of landscape. Pines, mountains, shade, and some elevation gain. The views up top of the red orange rock outcroppings glowing in the sun. Magnificent! This is what you want. Conversation was light today. Mainly huffing and puffing with the occasional over here. My mind counting down till lunch or break or dinner. Anything! Cowgirl is a machine! No breaks. Onwards and upwards. I made us Taco Pie for the next couple of days. My taste buds going wild in anticipation! The last part of the day is a climb, big climb. Goes slower than expected and we stop short of thw summit. We find a nice clearing and set camp.

Basically we have to ford the river for the next 12 miles. Slowwwww progress. We managed to cross deep and swift currents without either one of us taking a plunge! Success! We find a nice sunny spot a couple hours before sundown and set up camp. Really our stuff will only stay dry for a few minutes tomorrow. Feels good for now though.

No hypothermia for us. Lets continue the rest of the day splashing across the river. All said we had 52 river crossings over two days. Goodbye dry feet. Ohh I am sure i broke physics. The amount of sand and gravel in my shoes is amazing! This must be simular too weighted dive boots. Someone is going to have some sculpted legs. We make our way out of the canyon to the highway. Rolling in to Doc Campbells and there is Sparky! Cool drinks, chow, and resupply. Front door service, this man is top notch. We use the ol internet updating everything, charge our electronics and hit the trail. A few more miles and our first bit of night hiking.

The Guthook app is lacking when an alternate is selected. No notes, profile is incorrect, miles to markers is not reflected. So there was a couple ups and downs that werent expected. Trail was busy today. Ran in to 5 people! Most backpackers, but a couple had a string of ponies. We chatted them up, me hoping for a cool beverage, but to no avail.

A fight for every step forward. Almost as bad as walking up the river. Finally we come down to a drive up camping area. There's a few vehicles, but no people around. We cruise on down hill and hit the road. We follow it for a handful of miles before it takes back to the mountains. ""Follow a stream bed"" says thw guide.

Joe, a shed hunter heading home, stops and asks if we need anything. Drinks and snacks are always welcome! Always. He opens his camper and loads up with crackers, oat bars, peanut butter, and Cowgirls favorite, Dr. Pepper. Thanks Joe!! Lack of water. We end the road walk and head back into the mountains.

The rest of the place is private ranches with all kinds of keep out and piss off signs. With the notable exception at mile 15 is a Trail Angel that offers water and camping. Back to walking. Miles are flying and we are holding a good pace. Theres a dozen or so cars pass us. All doing about 55mph and never slowing. Thanks you inconsiderate hillbillies. Just before town we run into the owners from the pie place. They stop and say hello. Very nice people. Then we see Sparky! Back to base camp. Showers, beer, Ham Dinner!! Life is good out here.

The raging river threatening to pull them both down. I make my approach only to find it is breaking away 20 feet before i can get to them. Precious time ticking away as they slowly fight their way to stable ice. Finally they emerge. Now we are racing the clock to fight off hypothermia. Cowgirl still wants to push for the summit. The entire river is impassable. I pull up the map and make a route adjustment. Cross country we go. Snow drifts, side hill walk, and finally the top! Most dangerous day yet!

Almost no cars are out here yet. Snow covered mountains as far as the eye can see. I get into high speed and move downhill. Cruising. A few good pics taken. Some deer playing in the road....smart fellas. Finally i roll into town. I head to the P.O. but its closed for lunch. I hang around and wait and pick it up. Then i brake for some tacos. Good call. Some weather passes through. Looks like its head for CG. Hope she is doing alright. Back to the road...forward progress to be made! Just outside of town Jose Chavez ""Shorty"" stops me and we chat. Great guy. Time to go! My feet are killing me. The new shoes i picked up are wrong in about every way possible. Forward i trudge on, slightly limping. Only an hour till Sparky picks me up. I make just past the ranger station. Thank goodness, i am sore. Back at the trailer warm, showered, and fed.","HWY 64
