Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/347253,"A little more than 2 weeks until I hop a train for Harpers Ferry, WVA. (Doing a flip flop thru starting NB and flipping back for the SB leg.)It will take almost 21 hours to get to HF from Atlanta including a 6 hour lay over in Washington DC. Should be an exciting start to my journey, if I can be patient and manage my anticipation. I've ridden trains in Europe but this will be my first Amtrak experience. Sue, my loving wife of 33 years, offered to drive me to HF, but with the price of gas nearing $4 it is more economical to go by train ($132).So...it's back to finalizing my 30 pounds of equipment, food, and clothes and making logistical plans. Departure date is June 2nd. I will post my equipment list when it is final. 
Currently we are dehydrating fresh strawberries, blueberries, veggies, burger, and jerky. Yum Yum. I will supplement commercial trail food with home prepared goodies periodically throughout the hike. Thank goodness for the home-based support team...Sue.

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/349270,"It is Tuesday and in 2 days I will begin the journey. Spent the weekend in New York near Albany celebrating my nephews graduation from RPI. Sue stayed in Atlanta and attended Tanner & Marisa's wedding. Obviously I did nothing to prepare for the trip. Also, in the past week, the sun porch HVAC unit pooped out, the jet ski was damanged (no one was injured thank God), and the ice maker quit in the refrigerator. Just more to do before I go. NO WHINING! So, I have listed my equipment, manufacturer, and weight (in ounces) below. The total is called base weight as it does not include any water or food as they are variable. I wanted to be at 20 pounds. Overall I am pleased with the result.

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/350803,"It is Thursday and time to head for the Amtrak station to begin the journey. Sue is driving me to the station and the trailn leaves at 8:45. It was tough watching Sue leave and I am sure she was a little upset by the fact that we won't see each other for over a month. I had mixed emotions. Sure wish she was up to hiking with me, but when a Weaver makes up their mind it is a very difficult thing to change.The conductor called for boarding and I was on the way to Washington DC. I had an isle seat next to a gentlemen from ATL going to New York for a new job. He had a whole case of videos and spent most of the night watching movies. I managed to sleep more than I had anticipated and finally was up and about around 5:30. Went to the club car for some Joe and met Vince. Now this fine gentleman liked to talk. He was a hair dresser turned investment advisor, turned gambling pro on his way to Los Vegas to particiapte in the world series of poker. You can't make this stuff up. It was very entertaining and the next several hours just flew by. At last we arrived in DC.I hoped to meet Gary Warncke, my college buddy, in DC. I walked around the terminal but did not see Gary. I checked my bag and made one last run thru the terminal. No Gary, so off to the Smithsonian Museum of American History. I believe every high school student in Washington had a field trip on the 5th because they were everywhere. Good times.Back to the station, had a couple tacos from the Bell and on off I went to Harpers Ferry. Two stops and we were on the platform. I say we because there was another guy with a pack standing next to me. He introduced himself as Mr. Cold Ears (trail name) and I thought I heard Cold Beers and followed him up the road. He stayed at one inn in town and I walked 1.5 miles to a hostel for the night. The Teagarden was very nice and I had the opportunity to meet some thru hikers staying for the night. I met Turnaround, (he headed the wrong way at Springer Mt. and everyone yelled TURNAROUND!...it stuck), Art Gypsy (a free-lance female photograper), Mike (no trail name) from Florida, Tippy Toes (a tall lady from Albany). They had great stories to tell and I sat there like a sponge soaking them in. Up at 7:00 only because I did not want to awake anyone in the hostel before quiet hours expired. I ate a couple pop tarts and headed out the door. I am now on my way at last.NOTE: Trail names are given to peaple as they hike the trail and are usually awarded early on the trail. I was given a name the 3rd day out. Most times you never learn the hikers given name.","Equipment List

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/350804,"Left the hostel and headed for the ATC (Appalachian Trail Conservancy). Needed to pick up denatured alchohol for my camp stove. Mr. Cold Ears was there and after a quick walk through the museum we headed out of town across the Potomic and in to Maryland. Hiked along the C&O canal path for several miles. Mr Cold Ears is from Cape May, NJ. He has done several sectins of the trail already as his vacation from Manager in a Super Market will allow. He is heade out for a two week stretch from Harpers Ferry to PA 501 some 180 miles. The hike was fairly easy and we encountered quite a few day hikers. The view back up the Potomic from Weverton Cliffs was really nice. You could visually see why Harpers Fery was such a strategic site during the Civil War. He who held the town controlled the river and easy access to DC.Spent the night in the shelter rather than pitching a tent. We were the only two in the shelter as most thru hikers are dong 20 to 25 miles a day. Had a great meal of dried spaghetti from Mountain House. It is actually very tasty.Hit the rack around 9:00 and slept OK for the first night out.","Harpers Ferry WVA

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/350806,"What a day. Had a shower along the trail in a State provided bath house that was literally 10 yards off the trail. Washed my clothes in the sink and wore them out wet. It was a very hot day with temps in the 90's. We stopped often and did all we could to stay hydrated. I am filtering my water through a MSR filter Sue and I purchased 10 years ago. It works great. So far we have had water sources (springs) with an abundance of water. Good news given the temps. We spent a good deal of time at Washington Monument Park near Boonesboro, MD. Went thru a museum on civil war relics and Ears sow a rifle that matched one his grandfather had found nearly 100 years ago. First time he has seen another one like his. The Washington monument was the first erected to George in 1827. Stone structure with a gorgeous view across the valley.   Met three ladies from Columbus, OH at the Pine Knob Shelter. I am guessing they are north of 60 years old and doing a 5 day hike south to Harpers Ferry. They were a hoot. They try to do a section of the trail every year and they said each year their group shrinks in size. The remaining 3 are die-hard hikers. Each of them are carrying 40+ pounds of gear. (My gear is 29 pounds)Also met two guys that we did not feel comfortable with (Big Country and ??). Decided to set up the tent (hammock for ears) and skip the shelter. The new tent worked great. had dried lazagna Sue made. It was quite tasty. Lunches have been peanut butter sandwiches, GORP (good old raisins and peanuts), and beef jerky.   ","Crampton Gap Shelter, Maryland

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/350807,"Up at 5:45 and made coffee and oatmeal. Yummy with the dried strawberries Sue and I did the past month. Met Half Tongue at the Ensign Cowall Shelter while having lunch. He was shaken up by a sighting at POGO camp. He saw a man in the rocks watching him. As he approached the guy turned and disappeared. Well, the POGO camp is named for a guy who was active in the local hiking club and met a tradgic death. Half Tongue thought he saw the ghost of POGO. Entertaning lunch.Another very hot day on the trail. We were crossing a road when a big yellow school bus stopped in front of us. The door opened the cute little old lady said, ""you boys look like you could use a cold coke"" and she handed each of us an ice cold beverage. My first trail magic. ( a random act of kindness shown by people toward hikers along the trail) Met two 60+ gentlemen from Indiana doing a southbound section hike. They were runners / cyclists and had much the same interests as me. We yapped like long lost friends. It is amazing the people you met. Also met Chopper and Greenman. Chopper is from Louisiana and just graduated from engineering school and Louisiana Tech. Greenman is Greeville, SC and got a 6 month leave of absence from his job to do the trail. They both are thru hikers starting from Georgia in late March. Slept in the shelder. Now the shelters in Maryland are really well maintained and inclde bunks and everything. Some have hardwood floors that rival mine at home. Nice digs. We had a little rain during the night but not enough to make any problems hiking (mud). Up early for a cup of Joe, Oatmeal, and off we went at 7:45 AM. Headed for our first State line crossing, and the Mason Dixon line.","Pine Knob Shelter

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/350817,"Got an 8:00 start after chowing on Mountain House dehydrated eggs and coffee (Starbucks of corse). Stopped at High Rock overlook witch is a hang gluiding launch site. Nice looking view across the valley. Still, not tempted to jump off the cliff with a kite strapped to my back. Continued on to Pen Mar park on the state border. Met up with Chopper and Greenman. They had been thinking about a trail name for me. They decided on Brew Ha. We had talked about brewing beer and how he could get started making beer when he was done. Brew Ha is what they holler in cajun country when they want another beer. So from now on I am Brew Ha. Hey, it could be worse.We met Chopper and Greenman at the Unique Bar and Grill for burger and beer in Blue Ridge Summit, PA. The owner of the tavern maintains the trail as part of the local hiking club. We had the biggest hamburger and french fry dinner I have ever seen. He served Sam Adams on tap so how could I resist. Had a few sprinkles while eating.Back on the trail with a full belly. Didn't take long to work up a lather at 90 degrees and we trudged on toward Tumbling Run Shelter. Met Long Time (56 year old Kodak veteran laid off) and his daughter Click (free-lance photographer). They were having lunch on the side of the trail. Pushed on to the shelter. It was the nicest shelter yet. The Privy had TP and hand clenser. As we started preparing dinner the shelter keeper arrived with a cooler of cold sodas. He and his wife mentioned a competition amongst the shelter keepers to maintain the nicest shelter. Nothing like a little competition to improve the status of the shelter.Turnaround, Long Time, and Click arrived shortly after we got to the shelter. Long Time has wanted to hike the trail for a ""long time"" and he convinced his daughter to join him. She will be married in October. They are a hoot to talk with. Turnaround is very quiet and keeps to himself. At first I thought he was looking down on us because we didn't start in Georgia. Alot of people think unless you start at Springer in the cold, wet spring you are cheating the trail. Not so with Turnaround...he is just quiet.Great day in paradise.      ","Raven Rocks Shelter

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/350818,"HOT day. Did not drink enough liquids and paid the price. Just did not have access to enough water. Pure and simple. Made it to Quary Gap just the same.Did my first resupply at Fayetteville. Bought cheese (colby jack), Pop Tarts, Ramon Noodles, and the biggest sub you can imagine. Again, started talking to the deli guy and he just kepy on piling on the meat and cheese. I had the biggest Italian Sub for $4.99. Packed that monster in the pack for dinner and off we went. Swilled two 2-liter sport drinks as well. Starting to feel the impact of daily mileage. Blisters, and soar Achiles Tendon in my right leg. Not enough to stop, but discomfort with each step. The Quary Gap Shelter was the nicest yet. Rhodies and Mountain Laurel suround the shelter. The Laurel are in full bloom. Called Sue this evening. Great to hear her voice. What can I say about a wife who lets her husband chase a dream for 6 months leaving her at home to deal with life. She is doing volunteer work to fill time while I am gone and of course working in the Operating Room through the week. Just wish she were here to experience this with me.   ","Tumbling Run Shelter

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/350821,"On the trail at 7:45 after enjoying Pop Tarts and Joe. Saw blueberries along the trail and had to pick as many as I could. Still a little early but you could find a few here and there.We were going to stay in a shelter but felt good, it was early, so we decided to press on to the hostel at Pine Furnace State Park. The hostel was built in 1820 as part of a iron ore plant. They built arms for the Northern troops during the Civil War. Also, there was an underground room used as part of the underground railroad. Very cool. They had a bunk, shower,dinner and breakfast for $25. Well, good deal right? Lets just say we do some pretty stupid things when challenged. This is at about the half way point for those starting in GA. The local general store has a challenge. It is the 1/2 gallon challenge. Eat Half a gallon of ice cream and win a prize. I am a sucker for this kind of thing. So...I finished off my half gallon in 48 minutes. Pretty quick, huh? Well the record is 9 minutes. I am bush league, but my name is in some notebook as a challenge winner and I got prize (a wooden spoon with half gallon challenge written in magic marker). What can I say. This took place at 4:30. Needless to say I was not up to eating at 6:00 when the hostel served spaghetti. Met Overload, (a squirrel of guy who arrived at the trail with over 65 pounds of gear), Buckeye Flash from Kent, Conversation, Pele, Check List, and Spike. All in the early 20's. Check List is from Maine. He arrived in Georgia with 25 military MRE's (meals ready to eat) that weighed a ton. He said he has 50 cases more at home he planned to eat along the way. Needless to say he wised up and selectd more pack-friendly food. Every one has a story.We passed the official half way point. It was marked with a really nice sign and even though we are clearly just beginning, we stopped to take pictures.Went to bed with a gut full of Vanilla ice cream.","Quary Gap

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/350824,"Woke up at 5:45 with a belly still full of vanilla ice cream. Had a couple Pop Tarts and a cup of coffee. Felt sluggish all morning. Just did not have any pep. Another hot (90 degree) day. Stopped at Green Mountain general store for lunch. Got a couple bottles of Gator Aid, Slim Jims, and a fruit pie. Ate PB and cheese along with the other treats. Still felt sluggish. About 8 miles into the day I had an urgent call for a cat hole. (A cat hole is a small hole you dig when there is no outhouse around) Should have dug a deeper hole. But, I sure felt better.Met Humpty Dumpty, Zack, Red Tag, and Soup at the shelter. Long Time and Click were also there. Made me think of what we were doing a year ago. My daughter Erin and Stephan Shirk were about to be married and we were busy in preparation. Hard to believe she will be celebrating one year on June 26th.","Pine Grove Furnace

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/350825,"Got out of Alec Kennedy at around 7:15. Filled up two bottles of water and headed north. Walked 4 miles to Boiling Springs, Pa. Picked up a mail drop sent by my bride and re-stocked the food cache. Bought denatured alchohol for the stove and got out of town. Very flat as we crossed Cumberland Valley. Can't wait to get to the hotel tonight. I stink like a homeless person and everything I have is dirty and damp from a week on the trail. Today's hike went along farms in the valley and we were treated with an abundance of mulberries. I don't know that I ever had a mulberry before. They are quite tasty. Ate some jerky and GORP to get me through. Arrived at the hotel at around 3:45. Did laundry and jumped in the pool. Went next door and had a prime rib dinner and a couple Sam Adams Summer ales.Spoke with my Dad, son Byron, and Sue this evening. Great to catch up on activities outside the trail.","Alec Kennedy Shelter

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/351493,"Motel living is very nice and as a result we got a late start out in the morning, around 9:00. Of course we took full advantage of the continental breakfast offered, who wouldn't. I must say, cereal, doughnuts, and bagels (yes plural on each) sure tasted fine. A couple bagels to go and we headed out the door for the trail. The day's hike was quite different in that we hiked half the day in open farm fields. Unfortunately we did not have the mulberries to keep us energized and had to rely on the packed provisions. Lunch was at the Darlington Shelter and consisted of PB and one of the carry-out bagels from the C Breakfast at Motel 8. After lunch we got caught in the rain. Now, keep in mind we just did laundry and were quite proud of our frest scent. Now everything is wet and clammy. So much for refined living.We arrived at the Cove Mountain Shelter at about 3:30 and my wet toes were ready for a break. As I sat rubbing the poor fellows, Cold Ears headed for the spring for water. He came a yelping up the trail and I thought for sure he spotted his first bear. As he got closer I understood the yells were those of joy not fear. And then I saw the bullet. Dog gone if he didn't find a Coors Light in the spring left as trail magic. Now most of you know Coors Light is not my beer of choice, but when he offer me half a can of beer, I felt obligated to accept. NICE! Still not my beer of choice by the way.As we sipped the treasured nector, we noticed the wood of the shelter had been eaten away in places. Upon further investigation, we saw a sign warning of Porcupines invading the shelter seeking salt from where sweating hikers sat or slept. Given the heat and the fact that I sweat like a pig, I was sure that critter would find me a delight. I slept that night with rocks by my side just in case we caught the fancy of the Porcupine. All for not. He knew better than to test the arm of Brew Ha!","Route 11 Carlisle, PA

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/351500,"Remember that heat? The rain took that away and left us with a 45 degree evening. I was warm enough in my 45 degree bag, but was happy I had thought to put on socks. Last night the shelter had filled up with about 10 people. A guy named Zack had a home backed fruit bread that he only offered once. He was a section hiker and I don't think he quit understood the thru hiker mentality. That is, if food is offered, take it before it is gone. We were up and on the trail by 8:00 after some tasty pop tarts and a cup of Joe. After an quick 5 miles we came to Hawk Rock which provided a beautiful view across the valley into the town of Duncanon. The plan was to find the library, update the journal, get lunch, and then move on. We stopped at the local convenience store and bought gator aide and advil. Then off to the library. Sorry Charlie...the Duncanon library is open Wednesdays and Saturdays only. BOO! OK, off to the Doyle Hotel for lunch. Sorry, the Doyal opens at 11:30. It was 10:30. Decision time. Cold Ears is way ahead of his schedule. He is hanging in town. If I spend 2 or 3 hours waiting for lunch I will not be able to make my next stop. Unfortunately it was time for us to part. He was a great find when I got off the train in Harpers Ferry. We certainly entertained one another. We exchanged email addresses and and he headed for the Doyal. I for the hills.A word about the Doyal. It owns a lot of trail legend. It is a fact that Anheuser Busch built the hotel in the 1800's as a company hotel. Beyond that, the stories may or may not be true. One of the stories tells how a thru hiker stayed there recently and kept smelling something foul from next door. He finally got the desk man to check it out. Here there was a guy who had passed away several days earlier in the room just sitting in the chair staring at the street putting out the stink. The rooms are not exactly plush, in fact you share a community bath that one woman refused to shower in because of the mildew. Now mind you, a hiker smells worse than any mildew you might encounter so you know it must have been bad. The good news is they have cold, cheap beer and great chili. Or so the legend goes, for I will never know.Stopped a Subway on my way ot of town and the $5 sub deal. Ate half and put the other in my pack for later. Got to Clarks Ferry Shelter and joined Long Time for lunch #2. We headed out together for Peters Mountain. He was maybe 50 yards in front of me. The trail had a lot of rocks and you had to watch closely so as not to turn an ankle. I came around the corner and he was just getting himself up off the ground. He was focused so much on the rocks that he ran head on into a log that crossed the path. He got a 1 inch gash on his head which produced a significant mount of blood. I looked it over and could see it was not deep and the bleeding was not too bad. We cleaned it, put his hat back on his head and made for the shelter. Song Bird would later clean and dress the wound later that night.Another cool night in the 40's. Had a full shelter including Drum Solo from State College (who knew Ohio State was cheating for years), All In, Turnaround, and Byker. Byker is from Canton, OH and started at Harpers Ferry as did I. He has increased his daily mileage from 2 to 8 while losing over 40 pounds on the trail. He still is a big boy.Talked to the boss tonight. Sure was good to hear her voice. All is well in the home land. Cabbage are about to be harvested. Sounds great.         ","Cove Mountain Shelter

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/351508,"On the trail today by 8:00. Hiking by myself is nice. I can spend a lot of time thinking. Kind of like when I used to paint the wall in the back yard by hand. The sprayer was faster, but sometimes its nice just to think. On the otherhand, there is strength in numbers and today it would have been nice to have a wing man. I saw 3 snakes. One was black with yellow stripes, one was all black and about 5 feet long, and the third was a rattle snake. Now I have seen rattlers before, just not out of their caged environment at the zoo. I really don't think he cared much for me either. He rattled his tail and I shook my hiking pole and neither one backed down. Finally we compromised, I went down on the rocks and he slithered up the hill. About Pennsylvania. The trail name for the state is Rocksylvania and I am beginning to understand and concur. There are big rocks to climb over, little pointed rocks that reach up and grab your boot as you walk, and of course the rocker rocks that sway when you step on them. I am just plain tired (no Whining) of dealing with rocks. Had the last carry out bagel with PB for lunch. Then made my way to the Rausch Shelter. Met On Time, Loner Bohner, and Chirpa. On Time is from Iowa and we pretty much followed one another all day. He is a recent retiree and has some interesting ideas he shared with me. None of which I will repeat as they are a little out there. Anyway he is harmless. Loner Bohner (his name is Lee Bohner) is from southern Indiana. He is 70 years young and making his second thru hike. The first was interupted in 2007 by a broken leg in Vermont. He had to be rescued off the mountain in one of those cage stretchers you see on TV. Took 14 rescue personell to haul him down the Mountain. Half way down, he had to take a leak. The leader asked the ladies to turn their back while they turned the cage on its side and let him pee over the cliff. Loner said he got his money's worth and darn near flooded the valley. Chirpa is also doing his second thru, his first was at 60years of age. He is raising money through a radio station in Lansing Michigan. He calls in 3 times a week and gives updates on his progress.Temps in the 70's, nice breeze and the longest mileage yet.","Peters Montain Shelter

Thats a story for a later day.Beautiful hike today. Lots of vistas looking out over PA farmland. My feet continue to bother me. I stop about every 90 minutes and rest the poor old dogs. They do get to barking. These rocks don't help matters. (no Whining)Now Cold ears told me about the 501 shelter. IT is an old pottery shop complete with a skylight and solar shower. But...the best thing is you can order pizza and have it delivered to the shelter. I will take one large Hawaian Pizza and one chef salad and 2 liters of Pepsi please. That will be charge, thank you. Twenty five minutes later I was showered (forget the solar bit, it was cold as ice, but refreshing) and sitting at the picnic table making history of the salad and more than half the pizza. I finished the rest for breakfast in the morning. YUM!The shelter was full.

Got to the shelter with wet everything, again. The rain stopped and I was able to set my shoes and socks out to dry (somewhat). Then it started raining again and the 6 man shelter filled to overflowing. It pays to get there early, otherwise you don't get a space. I was not a big fan of shelter sleeping until Cold Ears convinced me to give it a try. It really is much easier than setting up and taking down the tent. You also get to know people along the trail. Most of the shelters are three sided lean-to style dwellings. Some are very nice, others, not so nice. The 501 shelter was completely enclosed and we each had a bunk made out of wood. The Eagles Nest Shelter was more of a lean-to, but they each have a Privy (out house) and a spring near by. Hopefully the Privy is downhill of the spring. Each Shelter has a trail journal that people check in and report what is happening. For example, you might read that the springs are dry for the next 5 miles so be sure to water up before leaving. Or you might read that someone jumped off the trail for a few days and will be returning. That way you don't watch for them and know they are alright. IT was from the journal that I learned Lebron will have to wait again for the NBA ring. Made my day!Had peas, carrots and hamburger that Sue and I dehydrated at home. Added them to instant mashed taters (not home made Byron) and had a very tasty dinner last night. Home made is always best, but it does take more clean up. I will take that anytime.

Felt and looked very much like a homeless person. Loner Bohner and I hitched a ride into the small town of Hamburg today after hikeing the 9.3 miles in wet slippery, ROCKY, trail conditions. No rain, but it is threatening. We dropped over 1,000 feet into the town down a very steep, ROCKY, slippery trail. Guess we will be climbing in the morning.Staying at the American Hotel in downtown Hamburg. The hotel was built in the 1800's and was recently renovated. Nice. They have a fine dining restaurant, but the prices are a bit steep for me.   If the bride were with me we would surely enjoy this place. Did laundry and made it here to the library in time to update the journal. It is tough remembering details, even though I do write notes every day. So, half of what you are reading is probably a product of my imagination. What can I say.I am off to the grocery and then off to find some vast volume of low priced food to eat.

We(Loner Bohner and I) were at the bus stop waiting patiently for the bus that never came. We double checked the schedule and sure enough even on Saturdays they are scheduled to run. Finally a local town hero came by and said they don't stop any more on the weekends. Great, we have 2.5 miles of country road to walk. Not the end of the world. We started walking and happened on a convenience store. I needed stove fuel so I went in to buy some ""heat"" in a yellow bottle. (This is the chemical used to dry out water in your cars gas tank.) Got the goods and asked the cashier if he knew anyone who might give us a ride to the trail head. He simply replied, no. Outside I went with a bit of a attitude toward the store clerk. As I looked up a guy who looked just like Popeye said with a studder ""I-I-I will take ya"". The guy was great but a little scary. He drove 15 miles per hour and chain smoked two cigs in the 2.5 miles we traveled. We thanked him and were finally on our way.The hike was straight up for the first 1.5 miles until we reached 1200 feet. We leveled out and then climbed again to Windsor Furnace Park. The park was a nature presreve and had a shelter I stopped at for water. Then back up I climbed to Pulpit Rock and finally Pinnacle. Because it was Saturday there were a lot of day hikers out and they all were very friendly and wanted to know about my hike. As we approached Pinnacle Rock a group of Boy Scouts wanted to show me snakes. I was not expecting much, but sure enough there were 3 large snakes (copperheads and rattler) down in a rock crack not more than 18 inches. They were enjoying all the spectators I guess cause they just sat there looking at us. After lunch, I proceeded on my way. Got to the shelter around 2:30 and decided to stop for the day. Eckville Shelter is a bunkhouse with a solar shower, flush toilet, and solar lighting. Had dinner (Spam and rice mixture) with a couple from Atlanta. Cheeta and Poncho are in their late 40's I would guess. He got fed up with his job and gave them 6 months notice and quit. She is the hiker, he is along for the trip. They were fun to be with. The shelter had a field for tents and about 25 boy scouts spent the night there. The shelter keeper was not happy with the number of people staying the night. He was most concerned about his septic system. Lighten up dude!","Hamburg

Saw two large Rattlesnakes in the rocks and they did not appreciate me being there. So I left as quick as I arrived. It is Father's Day and I got messages from both Byron and Erin. I tried to call my dad but was only able to leave a message. (He is on a cruise) The hike took us along several rock edges called knife edges. Lots of opportunity for spraining an ankle. The idea is to leap from rock to rock along this edge. Thank goodness it was not raining. Sat at a lookout and watched a hawk flying for about 20 minutes. He was looking for lunch I am sure. Had two supplies of trail magic. HO Ho's, brownines, pretzels, and little debbie cakes. Always a thrill to find these treasures. Met 2 trail maintainers from CT. They were finishing PA and would then have 3/4 of the trail done. They were very critical of the trail maintenance done in PA.","Eckville Shelter

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/352676,"Up and on the trail by 7:30 after after a hot bowl of oatmeal. This was a day to remember. First, I hiked nearly 24 miles, not by choice, but due to lack of water. I was completely dry by the time I got to the shelter. Then I learned the spring was an additional half mile down a steep trail. NO WHINING!The hike was through the Lehigh Valley. Climbing out of the valley was intense. First it was a steep climb that ended with a rock scramble over boulders. One slip and it was Bye Bye. The hike then passed through an old Zinc mining area that left the landscape bare of any vegetation. It was hot, steep and I was low on water. Not a good combination. Throw in ticks which were thick as I have ever seen and you get an idea of the day. The bright side was the abundance of blueberries along the trail. I ate a lot of blueberries.The wrap on PA is that there are so many rocks. Well I must agree that the PA rock fields are a real pain. Every once in a while there is a clear section and you can hear your feet sigh in relief. The foot pain from walking on the rocks is continuous. Oh the joy of hiking in PA. Got to the shelter around 7:00 in the evening. Met a hiker from Italy who has hiked all over the world. He speaks broken English but is fun to communicate with. He really struggles with our slang. Had a Mountain House lasagna dinner and crashed.","Bake Oven Knob

Had a major descent into Wind Gap that was made even tougher by the blasted rocks. I hitched a ride with a young college girl (still got that charm) into the town of Wind Gap and ate at a Burger King as the rain started to drop. I ate two double cheese burgers, a chicken sandwich, fries, and a large coke. Trail hunger has set in. Love that fat. I had to get back to the trail head and deal with the rain. So out I went. Got to the first light and a retired couple asked if I needed a ride. I could not disappoint them, so off we went. Turns out the guy is a retired International Paper guy and he knew Keith Cochran. Small world. They gave me $15 to enjoy a lobster roll in Maine. There was no refusing the kind offer. TRAIL MAGIC is great.The rest of the day was, you guessed it, Rocky and hilly and lots of fun in the rain. Got to the shelter around 4:00 and made a fine Raman Noodle dinner. Then ""Recon"" came by and offered us a Klondike Bar. Got to love that. It was probably the best tasting ice cream I ever ate.I saw a 5 foot black snake today and one deer.

Also, Rhodies were in bloom as I made the descent into the Delaware Water Gap. Saw my first bear as I was walking down a jeep trail. He looked at me and just kept walking. Unfortunately I walk faster than he does and was closing ground fast. Finally he had enough of me and heading into the woods. I arrived around 10:00 and got a shower and picked a bunk. There is no Laundramat in town so I did wash by hand and tried to get it to dry in the overcast, rainy weather. Never did get completely dry. Around 4:00 we had a major thunderstorm. Glad to be inside. I picked up my postal shipment from home, thanks Sue. I got some very special treats including rice crispy treats, and carmel corn. She made some great dehydrated meals that really hit the spot on the trail, including porage, pasta with ham and peas, and pasta with chese. Yummy.I ate at a local bakery. They had chicken pot pies and many baked goodies. I had a chicken pie and a peach pie. The peach pie was chucked full of fruit. It was sooooooo goooooood. Later I hit happy hour and enjoyed a couple cold Sams. Oh, and I will take the rib special too please. Unfortunately, the ribs were special and maybe out of date. I spent the night fighting severe stomach cramps and stomache ache. Don't care to eat another rib for a while. This too shall PASS, I hope.   ","Kirkridge Shelter

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/352695,"Walked the highway for the first 2 miles. Crossed the Delaware River and I was finally in New Jersey. Maybe the rocks will stop. Rumor has it the first 20 miles are still rocky then it gets back to normal. We shall see.Climbed 1,000 feet in 2 miles in a fairly steady ascent. As soon as I crested the hill, the thunder got louder and the rain began. I felt like Forrest Gump in Viet Nam. The trail became a river of water and everything was soaked. I planned to go 18 miles today. but given the weather, I decided to hole up at the Mohican Outdoor Center. It is a nature camp for church groups, schools, etc and they lease out bunks, if they are available, to thru hikers. I will take 1 bunk with shower please. Out of the weather at last. Tried to dry out the stuff. Got most of it to damp status at least. Spent the afternoon reading and relaxing. Had a spam burito for dinner. One of the hikers I met, Chirpa, is leaving the trail due to an injury to his foot. He is 70 years old and was raising money for a childrens center in Michigan. He had been calling the radio station at regular intervals to advertise his fund raising campaign. He was very emotional about having to stop his hike as you might imagine. Good luck my friend.So far New Jersey is not such a great state. It seems there are a lot of vistas and maybe the views are great, but I would not know. Happy trails.","Delaware Water Gap

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/352696,"Up and on the trail at 7:00. I spent the day walking in a cloud. It rained, misted, and was generally wet. The trail was very wet and muddy. And oh yea, still rocky. My feet have been wet now for 2 straight days and they are taking a beating. New Jersey added something new, swarms of mosquitos. These are the biggest, hungriest, meanest mosquitos I have ever seen. Oh fun.I was smelling industrial chemical odor for most of the afternoon. I realized quickly, I was the source. Remember the ""heet"" I purchased in Hamburg? Well, the bottle sprung a leak and was dripping out the bottom of my pack. Now remember, it is raining, everything is wet and mixed in with the water is ""heet"" fuel. Yuk!I got the bottle out and headed for the closest shelter to clean out my stuff. The Brink Shelter has water, but is located in a swamp. Guess what New Jersey creatures love swamps? Right, mosquitos. So I applied bug juice and tried to clean up heet soaked tent, clothes, etc. Just when I got everything out, it started to pour rain again. I set up my tent in the shelter (mosquito netting) and sat in there reading and passing time. Several other hikers have arrived and the shelter is full of wet smelly hikers. Finally we got a break in the rain and several went out and set up tents. No sooner did they get them up and the sky opened up again. Called Byron. He just took his first wine expert test and apparently it was very difficult. His meetings went well and the golf was great. It was good to hear his voice. Can't call anyone else, my battery is almost dead.Maybe we will see the sun in the morning. Weather forcast is not so promising.

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/352698,"Up and out of the swamp at 6:45. Good hiking today. Not so many rocks and it did not rain. The ground is muddy and the weeds are wet, but it is not raining. Not sunny, but it is not raining. The vistas offered nice views and made me wonder just what I missed the last couple days. Maybe I will re-hike this sometime in the future. New Jersey is supposed to have more bears than any other state along the trail. I have not seen one of these Jersey bears yet. Apparently they don't come out in the rain. Or maybe it is the chemical smell that still spews from the pack. At a cross road (US 206) there was a little coffee shop. I stopped in and had a breakfast sandwhich of eggs, sausage, and cheese on a bagel. Cup of coffee and a ginger ale. There was a bicycle race going on in a park just down the road and there must have been 200 or more cyclists warming up along the road. I would have liked to stay and watch, but...I didn't.Got to the shelter at 2:00 and decided to put stuff out to dry. Had some sun, but mostly clouds. Did my best to move wet things to the sunny places. Made a dinner from the dehydrated mix Sue made and enjoyed a good meal. (Noodles, peas, ham and parmesian cheese) Some mosquitos, but not as bad as it had been. Guess what? About 5:30 we had another thunderstorm. This time most of my stuff was high and dry. Finally ahead of the game.The trail is not quite as rocky, but everything is muddy. I am told the rest of New Jersey will be swamp and mud. Oh Boy. Hike on friends.","Brink Road Shelter

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/352699,"Started my day at 7:00 after porage and hot chocolate. Interesting day. Within 3 miles we were at the highest point in New Jersey. High Point Park has a monument marking this point at 1,803 feet. Did some climbing and rock hopping but not too steep. Then we dropped and then we climbed and then we dropped and then we climbed. Roller Coaster-like. We began to see swamps and mud as promised. Best of all, there were black raspberries all along the trail. I ate an enormous amount of berries. It was a nice day. Sunny and temps in the low 80's. The trail crosses many swamps. The trail uses planks and bridges to cross these swamps. At one point, we walked 2 miles around a bog that had bugs, mosquitos and heavens knows what all. Then we crossed a swamp on a mile-long plank bridge. All this, and I was again running low on water. Just before the shelter, there was a house with a spicket available to thru hikers. I filled every bottle I had and drank a liter at the spicket. Up the hill I went. Steep and about 1 mile long to the shelter. I was carrying 2.5 liters in bottles and an extra liter in my gut. It was a long mile.I am learning that New Jersey and New York have limited water available. I also learned today that my water bottle has a leak. Time to get a new bottle and carry more than the 2 liters I typically carry. More weight but given the swamps we are going through and the temps, more water is mandatory.The shelter did not have water, but it sure had skeeters.

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/352700,"Up and out at 7:00 after finishing my PopTarts. The trail was very muddy and swamppy. Seeing a trend here? We crossed Pochuck Creek footbridge that was a mile long boardwalk over a wetland. A very nice hike and because it was early in the morning, not too hot. More black raspberries along the way. When I arrived at NJ route 94 I hitched a ride to the hostel. Arrived at 9:45. Did laundry, took a shower and ate greasy burgers at Burger King. The hostel is at ST. Thomas Episcapal Church. The providers are very generous. They ask for a $10 donation for the use of the facilities. Including the use of the PC I am using to update this page. I will go to the local grocery and re-stock supplies for the next 4 or 5 days. New term. When you take a day off the term is ""taking a zero day"". I hiked a little over 6 miles before arriving at the hostel. I am taking a ""nero day"", or nearly zero. I will be up and out first thing in the morning.
My Italian buddy arrived at the hostel mid afternoon. He needed to have his camera repaired. So we headed for the grocery to re-stock and the camera store. The gentleman at the camera store was very thorough in his explanation that the camera was broken due to a mechanism in the lense that was bent or mis-aligned. The Italian fellow looked at him with a blank stare...he understood nothing the guy was saying. Finally I explained the situation the best I could. He finally smiled and said ""Oh, it is f--ked up?"" Both the camera store salesman and I broke up. Clearly he understood the situation.
We had about 8 guys in the hostel overnight. The washing machine and shower got a good work out. Lots of blisters and aching feet. Everyone enjoyed the break from nature for one night.","Pochuck Mt Shelter
",Vernon Hostel ,"Jun 27, Mon",6.50
Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/353536,"I got up early and crept around the hostel so as not to arouse my fellow hikers. I made a hot breakfast of porage and coffee in the kitchen provided by the hostel. I was leaving the church at 6:30. As I climbed the steps out of the church I saw 5 turkeys on the lawn at the back of the church. Is this a good omen? After all, Ben Franklin suggested the turkey as our national bird. It was a cool, sunny morning and I had a belly full of breakfast so bring it on.I did not want to walk on the busy highway back to the trailhead. So I took my chances hitching a ride (even though it is illegal to do so in New Jersey). The third car that passed me stopped and gave me a lift. The guy was on his way to work. He said he stops every morning when he sees a hitcher because he appreciates thru hikers dedication and the money they spend in his home town. Hey, what ever buddy, I just appreciate the ride out of town.The trail climbed about 1,000 feet in the first couple miles. I know it sounds like everytime I start a day out by climbing. There is a reason for this. Roads tend to run through valleys, not along mountain sides. The price paid for an evening in a trail town is the hike out of the valley the next morning. Of course I was weighed down with water and food so my pack weighed about 32 pounds. I worked up a lather quickly. Speaking of water. New Jersey and New York are known as states with limited water sites for hikers. This is due to the lack of fresh water springs. The NJ swamp water, (or wetlands as they like to say), is very acidic due to the trees and other vegetation living in the lowlands. Most agree it is smart to obtain water from parks or other public sources rather than filter water from the streams or springs as we did in Maryland and PA. The downside is that I must now carry 3 to 4 liters of water (at 2.2 pounds per liter). NO WHINING!The hike continued to be a roller coaster with rocky out croppings on top and muddy hiking in the valleys. Crossed into New York on a beautiful rock ridge with views into the Hudson Valley. As soon as we hit New York we seemed to stay higher in the hills and the muddy wetlands were left in New Jersey. The rocky ridges demanded some fairly technical climbing similar to the Lehigh Valley in PA. It was really a fun day of climbing and there were plenty of views to keep me entertained. At New York 17A the thru hiker companion book identified a creamery with homemade icecream just .2 miles east of the intersection. So off I went in search of a dairy delight. ""I'll take a double scoop of the daily special please."" I can't tell you how good that little treat tasted. As I arrived there were two hikers already enjoying the sugar buzz and three others arrived as I was there. I filled the water bottles (don't miss any opportunity to get water) and headed back to the trail with Vegan. Vegan is a 32 year old, recently divorced, sole-searching guy from upper New York. He had spent the last couple of years teaching English in Germany. Made enough money to fly home and hike the trail he said. He is thinking seriously of putting his Computer Science degree to work this winter as a snowboard instructor in Colorado. Sounds good to me Vegan. Good luck.Got to the shelter about 4:00 and it was full of happy campers. Pitched the tent and went about making dinner. New York and New Jersey have much in common. One common attribute is mosquitos. I was in the tent itching the little bites by 7:00 and asleep by 8:00. Did I mention the thunder? Had a storm about 1:00 AM. Oh the life.       ","Vernon Hostel

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/353538,"Thought I would get up early and beat the mosquitos. Wrong. Every thing was wet from the overnight storm and the little buggers were obviously hungry. The Wildcat shelter has a spring. As I filtered water into the bottles the skeeters enjoyed my blood for breakfast. Decided not to cook breakfast. Opted for Rice Krispy treats, jerky, and a Snickers bar instead. Breakfast of champions. Began hiking at 6:45.The hike was through boulder fields and along pink granite edges for most of the day. Up and down the boulder fields. On a clear day one is supposed to be able to view the New York City skyline from the top of Mombasha Ridge. It was pretty clear, but I did not see the Big Apple. We passed Fitgerald Falls and of course climbed the rocks up the 200 foot cliff. Fun hike but brutal on the feet. I saw two turkeys and one deer today.At 9.9 miles I crossed highway 17. It was here that ""operation firecracker"" was put into motion. First, I must come clean. I suffer from Morton's Neuroma. This condition is described as the thickening of the nerve due to pressure behind the toes. In layman's terms my feet are aching. Advil has become my new best friend. I decided just prior to Vernon that my thru hike was going to be cut short. Although my journey was going as planned, I was suffering from foot pain that was getting worse by the day. So...I decided to surprise Sue by showing up at the 4th of July gathering at our lake house in Blairsville, GA unannounced. Thus ""operation firecracker"" was hatched.First, I called and swore Karen to secrecy. My sister lives in New Paltz, NY which is about 30 miles from the Rt.17 / AT intersection. Of course she would be thrilled to pick me up and get me to the airport on Thursday morning, who wouldn't? The smell? Don't worry, I am a hockey mom and you can't gross me out with body odor...been there. See you at noon then. Sure enough, I was hitting asphalt on Rt 17 when the timex was striking noon and Karen was just a couple miles away sitting in a parking lot. Off to New Paltz, a shower, laundry, good food and a real bed. Up, breakfast feast, board the plane and into the friendly skies. Step one complete. Next a call to Byron and again a sworn oath of secrecy. My son is planning to attend the 4th of July bash in Blairsville and of course he can pick me up at the Charlotte airport Thursday evening and put me up for the night. He will now have company on the 3+ hour drive to the lake. The flight arrives, By picks me up as promised and off to the bachelor pad for the night. Wings and beer will be perfect, good idea Byron. We depart Charlotte for B-ville at 1:00 and the operation is full speed ahead. Now to say that Sue was 100% in favor of my journey would be a stretch. She was supportive, but not thrilled. So when I appeared out of nowhere she was certainly surprised and even a little elated. To show her ""appreciation"", she handed me a list of honey-dos accumulated over the past month. It feels good to be home again. And what was the first thing I did when I got to the lakehouse? I shaved the 4-week growth of a beard and started planning my next AT adventure. Don't tell Sue. Happy 4th!          ","Wildcat Shelter
