RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508277,"Well there is no backing out now. I have officially announced to my family, friends and followers on Facebook that I intend to hike the Appalachian Trail. This has been bouncing around in my mind since 1975 when I was stationed in North Carolina as a young Marine and first heard about the trail. Later I read about the Pacific Crest Trail in National Geographic and that was added to my bucket list of things to do. Relationships, kids, jobs and obligations managed to make the years pass way too quickly and before I knew it I was 58 years old. Where did all that time go? I remember when I thought that my 30 year old Staff Sergeant was over the hill! You wake up one day and there is a grey haired guy looking back at you in the bathroom mirror. How the heck did that happen?I finally decided to quit dreaming about making a change and start doing something to get it started. So here I am making my first official entry in my very own journal. I look forward to sharing this journey and direction change in life with you!",,Decision Made! ,"Jul 28, Tue",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508280,"Since I have been reading journals and web advice from other hikers for quite a while, I am slowly narrowing down my gear list. I am amazed at the advances in gear since I was a Marine. That was pre-Alice pack and we humped a canvas rucksack without a frame stuffed with 4 boxes of C-rations. I still have a scar in the middle of my back from the old snap that used to hook into our cartridge belts and grind away on your spine. I plan on going as ultra-light as possible because of a bad left ankle and knees. Luckily there is some awesome gear out there to choose from. I welcome any feedback and/or advice anyone wants to give me. So many choices!",,Gear Selection,"Aug 01, Sat",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508283,"Well the reality of what I am getting myself into is starting to sink in. I managed to roll out of bed this morning at dawn and start my training for the hike. Since I have a left ankle that has been pretty much destroyed over the years and two bad knees, I know I need to start training and getting into shape now. Luckily I live on a 9000 acre ranch here in West Texas and have plenty of room to train in. The terrain varies from flat desert to rocky trails over hills and a mountain right smack in the middle of the ranch. The hardest part was getting my butt out of the bed this morning and hitting the trail. It is amazing how your mind can come up with all kinds of alternatives and reasons for not doing it today! I hiked 3 miles round trip up to the base of the mountain and back. For the month of August this will me my morning routine before heading to work rain, snow or shine. Not that there is much chance of rain or snow this time of year out here. Just shine and more shine. While reading the book ""Balancing On Blue"" by Keith ""Fozzie"" Foskett, I saw that he mentioned changing the way he walked to help take the load off of joints and even repair some damage such as shin splints. He called it Chi Walking. I did a bit of research and found the video by the guy who wrote the book about it. I have modified my walking posture and gait and darned if it has not helped me a ton. In the past, if I even mentioned the word ""hike"" my ankle would start swelling and throbbing. It did twinge a bit this morning but held up well. Of course I did not say the word ""hike"" out loud and that might have been the key. My ankle was probably wondering why the @#$%^%$ I parked the car 3 miles away though.",,Training Day 1,"Aug 02, Sun",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508775,"My body is slowly adapting to my new routine of getting up every morning and hitting the training trail before dawn.

I can't wait!",,The Reward!,"Aug 04, Tue",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508776,"As I hike my training route each morning, I pass a Native American burnt rock Midden. Local tribes used to pile up rocks then build fires to get the rocks hot. After the fire burned down they would lay yucca and the roots of other local plants on the rocks then cover them up and let them cook for hours and sometimes days. It was the only way to make them edible. This particular Midden sits on a plateau just below the mesa I climb to each morning. From it you can see the entire valley below and anyone trying to approach for miles before they get to you. Every time I see it I wonder how many fires had been built there over hundreds of years. In the quiet of the morning you can almost hear the whisper of the trail cooks of the past there.",,Trail Cooks of the Past,"Aug 05, Wed",0

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/509772,Finally ordered the first of my gear today. I have to keep things light and that is expensive I am finding out. I went with Vargo for my stove and cooking setup. I listed it in the gear section for anyone interested. I was tempted to just go with my standard gear that I use on my canoe trips but I know that my body will appreciate every bit of weight I can cut and that increases the chances of a successful trip. My training hikes are going well and I can feel my ankle getting stronger with each passing day. I have started wearing an Aircast brace on my ankle and it is definitely helping. The combination of support and light compression on the ankle really makes a difference. The brace does not interfere with my shoe at all and is comfortable to wear while hiking. I have worn high top hiking shoes for years for the support but I think I may wear the brace and low top shoes for the hike. Thanks to everyone that signed my guest book and offered words of encouragement.,,First Gear Ordered,"Aug 11, Tue",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/510006,"Like most of us that set out to hike the AT, I have been asked why on earth I would want to walk 2180 miles and spend 5 months camping in the woods. I was thinking about that this morning on my training hike and the best I can come up with is that I feel the need to challenge myself from time to time. Something in me makes me want to shake things up when I feel myself settling into a comfortable rut. I have done so multiple times in the past and it is time to do it again. Also I do not see my self going quietly into the grey dusk of old age. There is so much world out there to see and I do not feel like following the ""normal"" model of working until I am the required age for retirement and then settling into a recliner waiting to die. There are too many friends I have not met yet and to much more to experience before I call it quits! I am so looking forward to stepping off on the trail with others like me that are not considered ""normal"" because we choose to push past our comfort zone in search of new horizons.

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/510082,"I had a bit of trail magic happen this morning on my training hike up the mountain that I do every day before heading to the office. Not the surprise of finding food and drinks along the trail kind of magic, but it was magical none the less. I was hiking along this morning and I saw a wild Jackrabbit hopping towards me along the trail. I stopped and leaned on my trekking poles to watch it for a bit and it kept hopping towards me. It stopped about 5 feet from me and looked me over. It then hopped up to my leg and gave me a sniff then hopped on past on it's merry way. It never showed any fear and acted like I was just a normal part of the landscape. I was amazed because these guys are extremely fast and always run away at the slightest thing out of the ordinary. I continued on and after a bit I realized that my ankle was not hurting at all. I cannot remember the last time it did not hurt at least a little. What kind of magical Jackrabbit was that anyway? As I got to the plateau just below the mountain that is my turnaround point, I saw a Mule Deer doe walking and grazing about 50 feet away. She just raised up her head and looked at me and, like the rabbit, carried on with her business of walking down the mountain and grazing. Like the Jackrabbit, these deer are usually very cautious and bolt at the very hint of danger. Again it is as if she thought I was just another creature that belonged and I posed no threat. Maybe it is the fact that I wear the same hiking clothes every day and have lost my scent. Maybe my poles make me look like just another 4 legged creature. I like to think that my spirit is slowly calming down with each day and slowly starting to match the rhythm of nature. For a brief moment I felt like I belonged there also and was doing exactly what I was supposed to be doing at that point in time. For a brief moment I felt the peaceful, calm, artistic, thinking side of me surface and I could feel the man I hope to find on my hike emerging. RavenWhale! Then my cell phone went off and it was a client wanting to meet with me later today. RavenWhale disappeared like the morning mist under the rising sun and Dennis the business man was back in the saddle. I have not found RavenWhale yet but I did get a glimpse of him this morning. He is out there waiting for me somewhere along the trail. I am sure of it!""That ain't no hill for a stepper""",,A Glimpse of RavenWhale,"Aug 14, Fri",0

I am slowly increasing it over time to let my ankle and joints adjust to the change. Part of the extra weight I added was a thermos of hot coffee. I have a designated ""coffee"" rock now on the ridge where I hike every morning. This is the way to start a day off! Sipping coffee while looking out over the valley below.

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511362,"My training is going well. I get up each morning before first light, eat a breakfast bar, strap on my 20 pound pack, grab my poles and head up the mountain for my training hike. I hike between 3 and 5 miles each morning before heading to work. It is amazing how my body is taking the routine in stride and has gotten used to the pack. I usually take a different route each day to check on water troughs and the horses. We take in rescue horses that have been neglected and/or abused by their owners. Our throw away society does not only use and discard things when they tire of them. Animals and even people fall victim to this mindset also. Currently we have 12 horses and two donkeys on the ranch and it does the heart good to seem them running around pretending they are wild horses. I was hiking a limestone ridge today and found the fossil in the picture. We find a lot of marine fossils out here. I have come across fossilized oyster beds, shells and even a fish in a big limestone boulder. It is hard to believe that I am walking on the bottom of what once was a vast ocean filled with marine life. It makes me realize that our short lives are just tiny little flashes on this planet's timeline. I am glad that I made the decision to include hiking the Appalachian Trail in my ""tiny little flash"" and I am looking forward to March! ""That ain't no hill for a stepper"".

My ankle has gotten stronger and now gives me very little problems. I don't know if it is the 12 pounds I have lost, my daily hikes, the ankle brace or the kiss on the leg from the magic jackrabbit, but whatever the reason my ankle no longer hurts!At the urging of my wife, I picked up a small video camera for the hike. I ended up buying a Sony Action Cam HDR-AZ1. I think she is as excited about the hike as I am. Her bad knee will not let her make the trip but she is my biggest supporter. I plan to start ordering the rest of my gear next month. I am headed to British Columbian for a couple of weeks and hope to get some hiking while I am there.

Hard to believe that if everything goes right, I will have completed my thru-hike by this time next year. Of course I realize that a lot can happen between that first step in Georgia and the last step in Maine. We can make plans, figure out schedules, calculate weights and estimate walking time until the cows come home but in the end, we are at the mercy of the universe and it often laughs at our puny attempts to manage it. One step at a time, one day at a time, living each to the fullest is my plan. I know there will be down days as well as beautiful uplifting days. That is pretty much life in general no matter where you are. In the Marines we have a saying, ""Embrace the suck"". When you are knee deep in mud and it is pissing down your neck, you have two choices. Bitch, moan and give up which only compounds your misery or just say screw it and accept that things are as they are and keep moving. Even though you are muddy and wet, if you keep pushing then you will come out of it.

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512622,"My wife and I are spending a couple of weeks in British Columbia where she is originally from. Got some great photos on the trip up from Seattle. We took Highway 20 over the Cascade range and crossed over the Pacific Crest Trail. The photo is taken near where it crosses the highway and I felt it calling to me as I looked down the trail. Maybe after the Appalachian Trail. We have had nothing but beautiful cool weather each day we have been here. I have spent a couple of days doing some work around her mother's home and tomorrow I am heading to Kamloops to do some hiking with my step son. He is excited about my upcoming hike and plans to meet me somewhere along the trail for a week or so. Each time we come up here it is harder to head back to West Texas. I was raised there but the mountains always feel like home to me. It will be good to do some hiking again. I have been missing my morning training hikes. Hopefully I will get some good photos.

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512997,"My step son and I did a 12 kilometer round trip hike into Spectrum Lake in the Manashee Mountains in British Columbia with a short side trip to Rainbow Falls thrown in the same day. It was a great trail for training. It had steep climbs and descents, pine needle cushioned trails turning into rocks turning into mud. Rain then sun then rain again. We had a great time and I wanted to just keep on hiking. In addition to the picture attached to this journal entry, I have uploaded several more that can be seen in my photos section. This country is like looking at a post card and it hardly seems real it is so beautiful. My wife and I have to make a decision soon whether or not to move here permanently. We have been offered her mothers home on 10 acres at a great price and are seriously considering it. The trail head to the lake in the pictures is only about 30 minutes from where we would be living. Maybe moving here is just another step in the transition that I hope to achieve on the trail starting next March. Life is definitely slower and closer to nature here and that sounds like the direction I need to head. Decisions, decisions. We are heading back to Texas on Saturday so my hiking here is done for now. I will be back to my daily West Texas training regime in a few days.

Start walking and keep walking until you no longer know the road like the palm of your hand, because we walk the same roads day in and day out, to the bus and back home and we cease to see.

Don’t try to get anything out of it, because you won’t. Don’t try to make use of it, because you can’t. And that’s the point. Just walk, see, sit down if you like. And be.

We are actually getting some rain here finally. It was nice and warm so I didn't bother putting on my poncho. I don't mind being wet and my training pack only has a poncho and 30 lbs of weights in it right now so no harm in it getting soggy. I didn't melt away so I guess I am not made of sugar. I did get a feeling of floating so that may mean I am akin to things that normally float. My new hammock, sleeps system, tarp, backpack and a few other things are ordered.

I train every day by hiking between 4 and 6 miles with a 30 pound pack before heading to the office. One of the advantages of being self employed is having more flexibility in scheduling your work day. I have been practicing with my little Sony cam and I think I have gotten the hang of it now. I am still not comfortable with talking to the camera yet and don't know if I ever will be. Some people make it look so easy. When I play the video back, I always seem to sound like a hillbilly from West Texas .... of course I am a hillbilly from West Texas and that may be part of the problem. Maybe I should start practicing using some kind of accent for narrating my videos. It seems like every documentary I see these days has a narrator with an English accent. On second thought that might not be such a good idea. Mixing a West Texas twang with my version of an English accent would probably sound like a completely new language.

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515528,"This morning's training hike was foggy and everything was covered in dew. It is amazing how quiet things get when the fog blankets the land. I came across the spider web in the picture and it started me thinking about Native dreamcatchers. Though it is said that dreamcatchers originated with the Objibwe people, one of my favorite stories about dreamcatchers comes from the Lakota. Here it is:~ Long ago when the world was young, an old Lakota spiritual leader was on a high mountain and had a vision. In his vision, Iktomi, the great trickster and teacher of wisdom, appeared in the form of a spider. Iktomi spoke to him in a sacred language that only the spiritual leaders of the Lakota could understand. As he spoke Iktomi, the spider, took the elder's willow hoop which had feathers, horse hair, beads and offerings on it and began to spin a web. He spoke to the elder about the cycles of life ... and how we begin our lives as infants and we move on to childhood, and then to adulthood. Finally, we go to old age where we must be taken care of as infants, completing the cycle. ""But,"" Iktomi said as he continued to spin his web, ""in each time of life there are many forces -- some good and some bad. If you listen to the good forces, they will steer you in the right direction. But if you listen to the bad forces, they will hurt you and steer you in the wrong direction."" He continued, ""There are many forces and different directions that can help or interfere with the harmony of nature, and also with the great spirit and-all of his wonderful teachings."" All the while the spider spoke, he continued to weave his web starting from the outside and working toward the center. When Iktomi finished speaking, he gave the Lakota elder the web and said...""See, the web is a perfect circle but there is a hole in the center of the circle."" He said, ""Use the web to help yourself and your people to reach your goals and make good use of your people's ideas, dreams and visions. ""If you believe in the great spirit, the web will catch your good ideas -- and the bad ones will go through the hole."" The Lakota elder passed on his vision to his people and now the Sioux Indians use the dream catcher as the web of their life. It is hung above their beds or in their home to sift their dreams and visions. The good in their dreams are captured in the web of life and carried with them...but the evil in their dreams escapes through the hole in the center of the web and are no longer a part of them. They believe that the dream catcher holds the destiny of their future. ~I look forward to meeting others who have managed to capture our shared dream .... hiking the Appalachian Trail!",,Natures Dream Catcher,"Oct 10, Sat",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516075,"Preparations and training continues. Not much new to report in that department. I post things from time to time that some might think have nothing to do with hiking and they are probably right. I always enjoy reading the journals of others and I figure every post is a way of getting to know that person and I enjoy whatever they are willing to share with us. Hopefully those of you who are following my posts will enjoy what I share with you also. In that vain here is a story and painting I did for my wife as a Christmas present. She grew up with a horse named Stranger that lived to be 46 years old. This present was to honor her and her friend Stranger. The painting is the one you see on this page and here is the story I wrote for her:""The Story of Ka and Ta-ba-bone By RavenWhale""Ka jerked awake and the furs and blankets that covered her fell aside as she suddenly sat up in her bedding. Listening intently, every fiber in her body straining to take in her surroundings, she tried to hear again the sound that had pulled her from her sleep. “It was only a dream” she thought as she tossed a small piece of wood on the glowing embers of the fire that warmed her small lodge. The cold wind howled outside and she could see the glow of the full moon as she looked up at the open flap in the roof where the smoke from her small fire found its way out of the lodge. “What a silly woman I am” she thought as she pulled a blanket across her shoulders and gazed at the fire. The dream had seemed so real and Ka longed to be able to closer her eyes and find her way back into it, but her body had other ideas.She was wide awake as she remembered that in the dream she had once again been a young girl and her father had just given her a young mustang that he had traded for. Her father had named her Ka, which means Raven, as soon as he saw her dark black hair when she was born. Her father had not been the chief of their Shoshone tribe but he was a highly regarded elder, and often sought after for his wisdom and knowledge of the many animals that lived in the forests. Her father had given her the young horse as a birthday present and from that moment on Ka and the young horse became bonded for life. She didn’t name the young mustang that day. She decided to wait for a name to come to her instead. Every day she would ride the horse and together they would explore the woods around their village. As the days went by she noticed that the young horse did not like other members of the tribe and would come to no one but her. She also noted that it chose to stand apart from the herd of other horses owned by her father and the members of the tribe. That is when the name came to her. From that day on, her horse would be called Ta-ba-bone! As the days turned to months, and the months turned to years, Ka and Ta-ba-bone traveled into adulthood together. Though the years, Ka loved and cared for her horse and Ta-ba-bone was always there for her when she needed his companionship and more than once he had protected her if he had thought she was in danger. In time Ka became Ka-Wa’ip, Raven Woman, and married a young warrior. As the seasons passed and the years began to add up, Ta-ba-bone was getting older and slower but the bond between the woman and horse remained strong. Ka and her husband had built their summer lodge next to the large lake a short distance away from the village. They both preferred the sounds of the animals to the sounds of the people of the village. At night Ta-ba-bone stayed in a corral they had built for him near their lodge and would whinny to Ka to come outside if she was late getting up in the morning. As winter approached the people of their tribe usually moved down to the lower valleys where it was warmer and the hunting was better. Ta-ba-bone had grown feeble and Ka knew he could not make the journey this fall. Her husband knew how much she loved the horse and agreed to stay in their lodge next to the lake until the old horse had made his journey to the Land of the Spirits. When the village people moved, the three of them were left alone and as the weather became colder, Ka’s husband hunted for meat to see them through the winter. The game was scarce on their side of the lake so her husband decided to take their canoe and paddle across to the other side to look for moose. A few days after she had sadly watched her husband paddled away across the lake, she had found Ta-ba-bone lying on his side in the corral. He was still breathing but unable to stand. She knew his time had come and their journey together in this world would soon end. She spread her blankets next to the dying horse and spent the rest of the day and night stroking his neck and singing softly to him. Just before sunrise, Ta-ba-bone made his way to the Land of the Spirits and Ka was alone.Though the ground was not yet frozen, it had still taken a full day to bury her old friend in the corral in which he had breathed his last breath. That had been over two weeks ago. Her husband was still gone and she was very worried because a heavy snow had came the night before and tonight it was so cold that the edge of the lake was beginning to freeze. If he did not come back across the lake soon, he would be trapped on the other side until the lake froze completely. She was almost out of food herself. Her stomach had been empty when she had gone to sleep. “Maybe that is what made me dream” she thought to herself. In her dream, Ta-ba-bone was once again a young mustang running across the meadow and calling to her. That is what had awakened her! She had thought she had heard his whinny on the wind. Just as she was going to chide herself again for being a weak woman and imagining things, she heard it again. She could have sworn that it was the voice of Ta-ba-bone on the wind.She quickly pulled her blanket around her shoulders and rushed outside expecting to see the old horse standing in his usual spot. She looked in the direction of the corral but saw that it was empty and her old friend’s grave was covered in snow. The wind’s icy fingers grabbed at her dress and blew her hair across her eyes. Even though the wind was blowing hard, the night was still crystal clear and she could see the light of the moon and stars reflected in the waters of the lake in front of her. Sadly she turned to go back into the warmth of her lodge but once again she heard Ta-ba-bone’s whinny on the wind. Turning she looked up at the sky and before her eyes it seemed the stars formed a pattern. She could not believe it. She could see her old friend Ta-ba-bone running across the sky. Tears came to her eyes and her heart filled with gladness as she realized that her lifelong companion was still with her and everything would be ok. Ta-ba-bone, the Shoshone word for Stranger, might have been his name but he had never been or would ever be a stranger to her. At that moment another sound found its way to her ears over the howl of the wind. She could just make out the voice of her husband calling to her from out of the mist across the lake. Tears of joy filled her eyes and she smiled as she looked up at the night sky and gave thanks. ""Aishenda'ga peaittempeh hainji"". ""Thank you old friend"". Ta-ba-bone had led him back home to her. Even though her old friend had passed over to the Land of the Spirits, he was, as he always had been, close by when she needed him.",,The Story Of Ka and Ta-ba-bone,"Oct 20, Tue",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516166,"I have added the climb to the top of the mesa that is part of our ranch to my daily training route. I never tire of the view from the top. The climb up is a washed out trail covered in loose rock. I figure it is just another element that will help me get ready for the upcoming trip. Most of my gear is in but I am still waiting for my pack and tarp from Z-Pack. I am looking forward to some shakedown hikes with the new gear this winter. I have been using a couple of apps as part of my training and thought I would mention them here in case anyone is interested. I use MapMyHike to track the mileage and time on training hikes. It is free and works well on my Note 2 phone. I was carrying some excess weight so I started tracking what I ate and the calories I consume using MyFitnessPal. It is also a free app that works well with my android based phone. There are a lot of calorie counters out there but I like this one because it has just about every food and brand you can eat already loaded into the app. Both these are great tools. I have dropped 22 pounds without really dieting. Just my daily training routine and stopping eating when I hit my calorie goal when MyFitnessPal says I have hit it based on my age and height. The reaction people have to my upcoming hike has ranged between ""Wow, I would love to do that"" to ""Do you take medication for those impulses"". One of the advantages of becoming a member of the Old Fart Club is that you tend to not give a crap what people think about you one way or the other. On a final note, I am a grandfather once again. This makes number six for me. When my daughter and her husband were trying to decide on a name, I lobbied hard for Geronimo. Seemed like a fine upstanding name to me but I was overruled. They settled on Landon which is not bad I must say. It doesn't evoke the same image of a West Texas kid named Geronimo on the warpath but that might be a good thing. Oh well, when he starts traipsing around with me, he will be known as Geronimo. RavenWhale and Geronimo. Now that does have a nice ring to it!",,Addition to the Daily Training,"Oct 22, Thu",0

She would love to hike at least part of the trail with me but her bad knee and her needing to spend more time with her mom due to health issues will not allow it.

I have been a blogger for a while on different subjects and at different sites. I will still be posting to my journal here regularly but wanted to have a dedicated site and blog also. I will be posting to both from the trail using my Samsung Note IV phone and portable keyboard. I have been working the bugs out of the process and it is working well. This will give me a place to post additional photos, videos and longer postings. I have also included some of my more popular written pieces as well as artwork there. As part of my hike, I will be raising funds for the nonprofit Semper Fi Fund which helps returning wounded veterans from all branches of the military. I love this charity for several reasons. First of all being a former Marine myself, I want to help my fellow veterans as much as possible. The second reason is that this group spends almost every dollar that is donated to them on the veterans. You probably have never heard of them because they do not waste money on advertising campaigns. They have one of the highest ratings of any group doing this type of work. The last reason is that they help where ""the rubber meets the road"" so to speak. For example they remodel homes to make them accessible by injured vets. They modify vehicles to make them drivable by veterans with mobility problems. They help in a ton of other ways too. The biggest challenge faced by returning vets with permanent injuries is trying to get back to some semblance of a regular life with their families. This group helps make this happen.

It is known as a Horse Crippler cactus for the obvious reasons and it could be a hiker crippler if you stepped on it. I get quite a few questions about the plants here in West Texas from visitors so I thought I would try to share information about the local plants when I can for those of you who have an interest.This particular cactus is officially known as Echinocactus texensis. They can get up to 12"" in diameter and you have to watch for them because they grow very close to the ground. The fruits are edible but you have to burn off tiny barbs before eating them. Like a lot of stuff out here, they may be edible but not necessarily tasty. Most cactus fruits are ok tasting but will never take the place of a peach or apple.Thanks for those of you that have checked out my blog, signed my guest book and sent words of encouragement and tip.

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517593,"I went to hook up my gooseneck trailer a few days ago at the ranch and found a nest with two baby Thrashers in the tongue. Needless to say I will not be using my trailer for a while now. Here in West Texas, places for birds to nest are few and far between. We have very few large trees so birds have to do the best that they can with whatever they can find. In this case the tongue of my trailer provided a bit of protection from the elements and weather, so they decided to call it home. What more does a living thing really need than that?Same for us on the trail. All we really need is a place to pitch a tent or hang a hammock and tarp to get a bit of protection from the elements, some food and drink to fuel our bodies and the company of people who share our dream from time to time. Author Betty Smith put it like this:""People always think that happiness is a faraway thing, something complicated and hard to get. Yet, what little things can make it up; a place of shelter when it rains - a cup of strong hot coffee when your blue; a book to read when your alone - just to be with someone you love. Those things make happiness.""I think one lesson that the trail will remind me of again is that in reality we don't need much in this life to be happy. Once we have the basics to meet our needs, we have to be very careful that the additional material things that we seek to own do not end up owning us in the end.

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517651,"I had some companions on my training hike this morning. Three of the rescue donkeys that call our ranch home decided they wanted to walk along and keep me company. They are good company and we seem to have a lot in common. We are all getting grey around the muzzle, all tend to be hard headed at times and we have all been called an ass more than once in our lives. Birds of a feather, or asses in this case, flock together apparently. These guys were used as guard donkeys by ranchers here in West Texas to protect their livestock from predators. They will bond to the group of animals they live with and protect them as if they were family against coyotes, cats and other predators. When the drought hit the area hard during the past couple of years, the ranchers sold their livestock and just dumped these guys out to starve. Luckily the rescue group I am associated with found them and now they live on the ranch along with another 17 horses. I cannot understand the mindset of someone who would let an animal just starve to death in the name of saving a buck. I guess it is an indicator of the ""throwaway"" society we live in these days. The rescue group picked up one horse that had been so starved it could hardly stand on it's own. The vet found a tattoo inside of it's lip during his examination. He knew that race horses are often tattooed and are in a database so he did some research. That horse had won over $250,000 for it's owner. When he had a couple of bad races they sold him. The new owner lost interest and just quit feeding him. I can't help but think that the further we remove ourselves from the natural world and the creatures that dwell there, the more desensitized and callous we become. I am beginning to wonder if this so called progress of mankind is actually a step back rather than a step forward. What is the real human price we are paying in the end? This is just another reason I am looking forward to the hike. My career has steadily moved me further and further away from the natural world that I grew up in and it is time I rediscovered it.Ok my rant is over.

Z-pack said they would be shipping my pack and the last of my gear at the end of the week. All that remains is a bit of shakedown after I receive it to work out the bugs and I will be ready. My training hikes continue and this old beat up body of mine is as ready as it is ever going to be I believe. We had a beautiful moon rise the other night and I hung out for a while in the corrals with the horses and watched it rise. Horses are always great company and rescue horses even more so. They seem so grateful and appreciative of everything you do for them. Some of them have a few quirks due to the abuse they suffered but once you get to know them and they trust you, a mutual bonding takes place. They soon become part of your everyday life and you can barely remember what it was like without them around.

Multiple times I have stepped out and done some things that people have called crazy and illogical. Each and every time it has worked out for me in the end. I have found that if you are bold enough to take the first step, the universe will give way and mold itself to accommodate your new direction. I always envision a bucket of water as the universe. When you insert your hand into the bucket the water moves aside and makes way for your hand. It molds itself around you and accepts you as part of it. It becomes the new ""normal"".

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517990,"As I was hiking on the trail and enjoying the cooler weather and sunshine this morning, I met the fellow hiker in the picture. It is unusual for tarantulas to be out this time of year but I guess he was out enjoying the sunshine also. I followed him for a bit and watched as he navigated the trail and obstacles he encountered on it. He went over rocks where he could and if something was too big he just went around it however he could. I even laid down and got a ""spider's eye view"" of the trail as he saw it and shot the picture above. It occurred to me that our experiences on the trail and whether they are good or bad is a matter of perspective and how we deal with the challenges we encounter. Whenever my buddy, Mr. Spider, came to something blocking his way he would stop, assess the situation, come up with a plan of action and move forward. Although he was slowed a bit by things he encountered, he always kept moving in the direction he was headed. He was ""Hiking His Own Hike"" and the fact that I was able to move faster or step over things that challenged him had no affect on his pace at all. He was headed somewhere and he was determined to get there. Not a bad lesson to learn from a vertically challenged, hairy little guy. I am reminded of a saying by a guy named Bob Bitchin.

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518195,"""In Praise of Walking"" by Thomas A. ClarkEarly one morning, any morning, we can set out, with the leastpossible baggage, and discover the world.It is quite possible to refuse all the coercion, violence, property,triviality, to simply walk away.That something exists outside ourselves and our preoccupations,so near, so readily available, is our greatest blessing.Walking is the human way of getting about.Always, everywhere, people have walked, veining the earth with paths, visible and invisible, symmetrical and meandering.There are walks in which we tread in the footsteps of others,walks on which we strike out entirely for ourselves.A journey implies a destination, so many miles to be consumed,while a walk is its own measure, complete at every point alongthe way.There are things we will never see, unless we walk to them.Walking is a mobile form of waiting.What I take with me, what I leave behind, are of less importancethan what I discover along the way.To be completely lost is a good thing on a walk.The most distant places seem most accessible once one is on the road.Convictions, directions, opinions, are of less importance than sensible shoes.In the course of a walk, we usually find out something about ourcompanion, and this is true even when we travel alone.When I spend a day talking I feel exhausted, when I spend it walking I am pleasantly tired.The pace of the walk will determine the number and variety of things to be encountered, from the broad outlines of a mountain range to a tit’s nest among the lichen, and the quality of attention that will be brought to bear upon them.A rock outcrop, a hedge, a fallen tree, anything that turns us outof our way, is an excellent thing on a walk. Wrong turnings, doubling back, pauses and digressions, all contributeto the dislocation of a persistent self-interest.Everything we meet is equally important or unimportant.The most lonely places are the most lovely.Walking is egalitarian and democratic; we do not become expertsat walking and one side of the road is as good as another.Walking is not so much romantic as reasonable.The line of a walk is articulate in itself, a kind of statement.Pools, walls, solitary trees, are natural halting places.We lose the flavor of walking if it becomes too rare or tooextraordinary, if it turns into an expedition; rather it should bequite ordinary, unexceptional, just what we do.Daily walking, in all weathers, in every season, becomes a sort ofground or continuum upon which the least emphatic occurrencesare registered clearly.A stick of ash or blackthorn, through long use, will adjust itselfto the palm.Of the many ways through a landscape, we can choose, on eachoccasion, only one, and the project of a walk will be to remainresponsive, adequate, to the consequences of the choice we havemade, to confirm the chosen way rather than refuse the others.One continues on a long walk not through effort of will but throughfidelity.Storm clouds, rain, hail, when we have survived these we seemto have taken on some of the solidity of rocks and trees.A day, from dawn to dusk, is the natural span of a walk.A dull walk is not without value.To walk for hours on a clear night is the largest experiencewe can have.For the right understanding of a landscape, informationmust come to the intelligence from all the senses.Looking, singing, resting, breathing are all complementaryto walking.Climbing uphill, the horizon grows wider, descending, the hillsgather round.We can take a walk which is a sampling of different airs: theinvigorating air of the heights; the filtered air of a pine forest;the rich air over ploughed earth.We can walk between two places, and in so doing establish a linkbetween them, bring them into a warmth of contact, likeintroducing two friends.There are walks on which I lose myself, walks which return me tomyself again.Is there anything better than to be out, walking, in theclear air?",,In Praise Of Walking,"Dec 07, Mon",0

Do you know its moods and changes? Then listen to the Wild -- it's calling you.Have you known the Great White Silence, not a snow-gemmed twig aquiver? (Eternal truths that shame our soothing lies.)Have you broken trail on snowshoes? mushed your huskies up the river, Dared the unknown, led the way, and clutched the prize?Have you marked the map's void spaces, mingled with the mongrel races, Felt the savage strength of brute in every thew?And though grim as hell the worst is, can you round it off with curses? Then hearken to the Wild -- it's wanting you.Have you suffered, starved and triumphed, groveled down, yet grasped at glory, Grown bigger in the bigness of the whole?""Done things"" just for the doing, letting babblers tell the story, Seeing through the nice veneer the naked soul?Have you seen God in His splendors, heard the text that nature renders? (You'll never hear it in the family pew.) The simple things, the true things, the silent men who do things -- Then listen to the Wild -- it's calling you.They have cradled you in custom, they have primed you with their preaching, They have soaked you in convention through and through;They have put you in a showcase; you're a credit to their teaching -- But can't you hear the Wild? -- it's calling you.Let us probe the silent places, let us seek what luck betide us; Let us journey to a lonely land I know.There's a whisper on the night-wind, there's a star agleam to guide us, And the Wild is calling, calling .  let us go.",,The Call,"Dec 16, Wed",0

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518629,"At the center of our ranch sits a high mesa that covers about 600 acres or so. This mesa is actually the tallest in the area and I love sitting at the top of it and looking out over the valley below. Many think West Texas is flat and featureless but that is not really the case. In our area it is made up of flat wide valleys broken up by mesas and hills. Further south, deep ravines have been formed by thousands of years of rain finding its way to the Rio Grande and Pecos rivers. This was the country that outlaws loved to disappear into when they were being pursued by a posse. Once in the maze of canyons and ravines it becomes very difficult to find them. It could be argued that it is still happening today. I have added the climb to the top of the mesa to my training to toughen up my aging knees and hopefully prevent problems on the trail. The scramble up is over loose rock and pretty steep but good practice for what is to come. You can’t beat the view from the rock ledges on top!I have all my gear now and I love my new ultra-light stuff. Gear has come a long way since the days I was a young Marine humping an old canvas ruck sack stuffed with “C” rations and ammo. MRE’s were available then but only to the long range recon guys. I know that many are not fortunate enough to be able to afford the latest ultra-light gear and I am thankful that I have worked myself into a position where I can. My advice to fellow hikers on a budget is to buy the best quality that you can afford then get going. I also sail and this is the same advice that is given to would be cruisers. If you wait until you can afford the perfect boat or the best of the best gear then you will never go. Just gear up the best you can, plan as much as is possible, then step off and get going. When you run into a problem, adapt and overcome. Hey it has worked for me! I will post a list of my gear as soon as I get the chance for anyone that is interested. There are tons of resources out there concerning gear but maybe there is someone that can benefit from my list also. I am still planning on a February 25th start. The prediction is for a wet and cold spring due to El Nino. I guess we will see in a couple of months. There are so many details to attend to between now and then. As always thanks for the kind comments in my guest book and email. The guestbook format doesn’t really lend itself to responding back but know that I appreciate everyone’s input. I think I will leave you with a quote by an author named Philip Connors. I think it pretty much sums up what I hope to gain from my little 2200 mile walk in the mountains. This is what he has to say about it:“The greatest gift of life on the mountain is time. Time to think or not think, read or not read, scribble or not scribble -- to sleep and cook and walk in the woods, to sit and stare at the shapes of the hills. I produce nothing but words; I consumer nothing but food, a little propane, a little firewood. By being utterly useless in the calculations of the culture at large I become useful, at last, to myself.”Take care and I will see everyone down the trail.",,Mountain Time,"Dec 22, Tue",0

It seems at times that there are no solutions for the problems that plague our country and I worry about what kind of future my kids and grandkids will have. My mind conjures up all kinds of scenarios that could happen while I am hiking and away from my family. I have even considered putting off my hike until ""things get better"". It is easy to fall into the trap of wishing for the ""good old days"" before things are as they are. Then I realize that we are actually in our very own ""good old days"" right now even though it might not seem like it. The truth is that this country and the people in it have always faced challenges and I am sure that each generation felt the same feelings that we do about what they were dealing with in their own time. The American people are a good hearted, resourceful and tough bunch. We have always faced challenges head on and overcome them. This generation will be no different. There have always been conflicts, crooked politicians and bad people doing bad things. Unfortunately, this has always been, and probably will always be, true. What is also just as true, and much more important, is that there have always been good people that work to overcome the bad and in the end prevail! This will be no different in our time!I am looking forward to stepping off next year and joining my fellow members of the Class of 2016 in creating our very own ""good old days"" on the Appalachian Trail!

Take care all and I will see you down the trail.""The Peace of Wild Things""When despair for the world grows in me and I wake in the night at the least sound in fear of what my life and my children’s lives may be, I go and lie down where the wood drake rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds. I come into the peace of wild things who do not tax their lives with forethought of grief. I come into the presence of still water. And I feel above me the day-blind stars waiting with their light. For a time I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.",,Merry Christmas Everyone!,"Dec 24, Thu",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518847,It snowed all day on Saturday here in West Texas. I actually went out hiking in it to get some practice and check to make sure the water troughs were ice free for the horses. The day before my wife and I had breakfast on the front porch in 60 degree weather. Out here if you don't like the weather then wait 30 minutes for it to change. Actually setup my hammock and tarp and finished rigging them up to allow for fast pitching. Snow is predicted for Saturday again so I intend to pitch them and spend the night outside in the storm to further work out any bugs. This post is actually being done using my Samsung Note IV phone and portable foldup Jorno keyboard. I love this little tri-fold keyboard and it will be going with me on the trip. I will be maintaining my blog and trail journal daily from the trail as cell service allows. Thanks for all of the holiday wishes from everyone. I wish everyone a Happy New Year. 2016 is just around the corner gang and our stepping off day will be here before we know it. This is our year! Take care and I will see you down the trail.,,West Texas Blizzard,"Dec 30, Wed",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518864,"Long distance hiking, and the people who are part of that culture, have their own slang and sayings. One of those is the acronym ""HYOH"" which stands for Hike Your Own Hike! The meaning behind this phrase is that everyone has to complete their own journey, at their own speed, in their own way. Some hikers move really fast and others are very slow. Some like to hike directly from point A to point B as quickly as possible while others are the ""stop and smell the roses"" types who take every side trail and enjoy every view along the way. Some start at the south end of the trail and head north (NOBOs) and some start up north and head south (SOBOs). Then you have the Flip Floppers who walk the trail from one end to the middle then ""flip flop"" and start again from the other end to complete the trail by meeting where they left off before they switched directions. They do this for various reasons such as to take advantage of the weather in different regions at different times of the year or to alleviate scheduling conflicts. Some people are Section Hikers that hike a portion of the trail each year during their time off from work. Others are Through Hikers that attempt to complete the whole trail in a year or less. Every journey and method of completing it is entirely up to the individual hiker. The point is that everyone is different and their journey on the trail is as unique as they are. There is no right and wrong way to complete the trip because you define success for yourself. You are not supposed to feel bad because someone else is faster or slower than you. Even if you start out as part of a group, it is acceptable, and very common, for everyone to drift apart as their personal journeys dictate. Later on if fate brings you together again, you enjoy each other for a period and then carry on with your journey. Occasionally hiker's gaits and habits compliment each other and they end up hiking together for long periods of time, then drift apart for various reasons. Sometimes they will meet up again down the trail and sometimes they never see each other again. That is the nature of the trail and each hiker's personal journey.It seems to me that long distance hiking is actually a metaphor for life itself. We all are traveling our own paths through life, in our own ways, and doing our best to get to the end in one piece. Along the way we meet people and are able to enjoy their company for a time. Often, as on the trail, their journey eventually takes them away from us. Sometimes for a short period of time and sometimes forever. That is the nature of the tail and of life itself. If you are really lucky, you meet someone on a similar path as you, with the same vision, and their ""life gait"" matches yours. If that happens, then you have found a potential hiking partner for this crazy journey called life. I am definitely one of the lucky ones! Fate brought an awesome woman my way that could not have been a better match for me if I had designed her myself and placed an order. We made the commitment to be hiking partners for life exactly 15 years ago, tonight at midnight. That's right! We were married at the stroke of midnight, as the clock ushered in a new year and a new millennium, in the year 2000. Here we are 15 years later and we still enjoy each and every day we spend together and are looking down the trail to many more. So that brings us back to the title of this post .... ""HYOH"". Hike Your Own Hike on the trail and in life! Don't feel bad that your way of doing it is different than anyone else's. It is your journey and you determine how you make your way down the trail of life. The definition of what constitutes success is also up to you. What I consider success is completely different than what you do. What I consider a ""Win"" is not going to match up with what you think winning is. That's ok! If we meet up on the path of life at some point, we will enjoy each other's companionship for a bit, then step back off on our own paths and continue our individual journeys. That is the nature of the trail and that is the nature of life!So here we are on the cusp of another year. At the stroke of midnight tonight, take that first step on your journey, as you define it, and HYOH!Take care and I will see you down the trail next year!",,Hike Your Own Hike (HYOH),"Dec 31, Thu",0

My start date is just around the corner and everything is coming together. Part of my hike is to raise funds in support of the non profit ""Semper Fi Fund"" which helps our returning wounded veterans. The admins of this site have graciously given me permission to post a link to the site where anyone can make a pledge of so much per mile to support this great cause. You can pledge a penny per mile on up. After I complete the hike then it is up to you to send it to the Semper Fi Fund. Paul Mitchell, a fellow through hiker, built a site that allows hikers like us to register to hike for the charity of our choice. He makes nothing on the site and it is up to the sponsors to turn their pledges into donations and send them directly to the charity when the hiker completes their trip. I urge anyone that is interested in hiking for a cause to check out his site at www.hikefor.comIf you are interested in joining my ""Mission Possible"" to help out the Semper Fi Fund then please go to http://www.hikefor.com/RavenWhale/AT/2016 and make a pledge.

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519425,"I don’t post a lot about gear because there are a lot of people out there that are much better qualified to talk about the subject than I am. My system for choosing gear is not very scientific but it works for me. I use my past experience as a starting point, then, add lots of research to that. Then I factor in my physical problems and preferences to cull the offerings down to a handful of choices. Once I have a narrowed down list of items in each category, I run it through the financial filter. For example is that Cubin Fiber tarp you see above worth the extra cost to save weight and if so can I afford it? As you can see by the picture showing the tarp pitched over my hammock in my front yard the answer was yes. I feel that choice is the right one for me at this point in time. Now 20 years ago it would not have been. I was younger, stronger and poorer so I would probably have “made do” with something cheaper and heavier. That would have been the right choice, for me, at that point in time. The main thing is not to let yourself fall into the trap of thinking that if you cannot afford the “perfect” gear as defined by all of the “experts” then your adventure will be less than you want it to be. I have known sailors who dreamed of going cruising “someday”. They owned great boats but never set sail because they didn’t own the “perfect” boat and gear. They spend their lives working to save up for it and then wake up one day to find out they are too old to go. Or worse, don’t wake up at all one day!Don’t get me wrong! Everyone needs adequate gear for the adventure that they are setting out on. If you are ill equipped you are a liability to yourself and others. But adequate does not necessarily mean the latest and greatest. If you are young and strong but have limited funds, then you will have no problem using a heavier and cheaper tarp. Use your strengths to offset your weak areas. Figure out what you need, acquire it and then step off on your adventure. Actor, sailor and author Sterling Hayden summed it up when he said “What does a man need - really need? A few pounds of food each day, heat and shelter, six feet to lie down in - and some form of working activity that will yield a sense of accomplishment.” That is pretty much it in a nutshell. Once you have the necessities covered, everything beyond that is cream.The most important asset that you need to embark on any adventure is what is already inside of you! In the military I have seen guys that looked as if they were in perfect condition. They could have been models on the cover of the fitness magazines that we all see next to the checkout counters. You think to yourself that they are going to kill it when it comes to the physical stuff. Often though, they are the first to fall short when the going gets tough. When they hit the “wall” physically they are done and just quit. It is often the ones that don’t appear to fit society’s image of the perfect man or woman that push through and end up succeeding. The difference is what is inside of them and the knowledge that it is there when they needed it.There is a saying in the military that when you think you are done physically and think you can’t go on, then you are only 40% done. That is your mind telling you that you can’t go any further and you must quit. Your body still has 60% left! You just need to override your mind and tap into the 60% that is left. I believe that all of us have that in us, we just have to know it is there and be able to reach deep down inside and pull it out when we need it.So on that miserable day when the rain is pissing down your neck and your mind is telling you that you are done, just tell it to “Shut the hell up”, reach down and tap into that 60% that you know is sitting there in reserve. Know that if you keep moving forward you will come out on the other end and on that beautiful sunny day further down the trail you will be glad you did.Take care and I will see you down the trail.",,"The ""Perfect"" Gear","Jan 09, Sat",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519720,"My daughter sent me a pair of wool long underwear for Christmas and that pretty much completed my gear for the hike. A year ago I would not have even considered wool as something I would put on my body. Having grown up in West Texas, wool was something that we raised and sold to make money but very few of us ever actually wore it. I was first exposed to wool in the Marines when I did a short temporary operation in Korea with the ROK Marines one winter. I was issued the standard heavy parka and cold weather pants that felt like they weighed about 20 pounds each. I was also issued wool long johns, wool hood/hat and some Mikey Mouse boots. At least they said it was wool. Against my skin it felt more like a cross between heavy grit sand paper and a briar patch. If I hadn’t known better I would have sworn that the prior occupant of the pants left a prickly pear cactus in the crotch. I itched and was rubbed raw everywhere by the end of the operation. I don’t know what kind of wool it was but if it came from a sheep, he must have been really pissed off when they sheared him. That was pretty much my one and only interaction with wool and swore I would never wear anything made of it again. It is funny how we get things fixed in our minds and believe, beyond a doubt, that they are true no matter what anyone else says. My wife has been telling me how soft and warm wool is for years. Being Canadian and raised in the bush, she grew up wearing it and I just figured that she was used to the feeling of it against her skin. No matter how much she told me otherwise, I was convinced that all wool was alike and wanted no part of it. Well last year I finally broke down and tried a pair of Merino wool socks just to see how they felt. Surprise, surprise! They were soft and warm and wonderful! I added wool t-shirts and long johns to my gear. I have to admit that my wife was right and I was wrong. I have been converted from a wool hater to a dyed-in-the-wool lover of wool. Apparently the government had a contract with raisers of mean ass, pokey wool sheep herders. The wool I am wearing now definitely came from happy sheep! It just goes to show you that maybe we need to challenge our long held beliefs from time to time. Things change and so do we over the years. It would be a shame if a deeply ingrained belief or bias prevented us from experiencing something that would add joy and pleasure to our life.I guess I should go out and apologize to my pet sheep Ryder for talking trash about his kind for so long. The picture is of him after the snow storm. He is actually a black sheep. The white is snow and ice on his coat. Apparently he likes wearing wool too!Only 42 days till I hit the trail. And yes I will be wearing my woolies. Take care and I will see you down the trail.",,Dyed-In-The-Wool,"Jan 15, Fri",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520281,"Well the final countdown has started. Right now I am T - minus 30 days until I take my first step on the Appalachian Trail headed north. I grew up during the time of NASA's Apollo program and followed each launch. That was exciting stuff for kid raised on a ranch in West Texas. Getting ready for this trip has been a lot like the river trips I take from time to time. The planning and preparations is a lot like when you first launch your canoe on a slow moving river. You meander along enjoying the ride and time seems to pass slowly by like the banks on a lazy river. Every once in a while you stroke your paddle to keep the canoe headed in the right direction but you let the current slowly take you downstream at its own speed. The same goes for the preparations for a long hike. You do a bit of research and pick up another piece of gear but the pace seems very slow and you feel like you have plenty of time to get everything done. Things meander along at their own pace and it seems like your planned start date is so far off.On most rivers, as you move downstream, the speed of the current keeps increasing and you realize that you just can’t lay back and float along any longer. You have to actually put some effort into keeping your craft headed downstream and avoid the rocks along the way. The same type of feeling sets in as your hiking start date gets closer and closer. That “I have plenty of time” feeling is replaced with “I had better pay attention and get busy”. The days seem to start passing faster and faster and unforeseen obstacles start appearing that you have to deal with on an almost daily basis. A low level panic feeling starts to set in and you begin to worry that you will not get everything done before it is time to go.At some point on most river trips, the water gets squeezed between canyon walls and the water flow increases to a point that you feel like you are on the verge of being out of control. All you can do is paddle like mad, try to keep your canoe between the rocks and trust that you will squirt out the other end upright and in one piece. That is pretty much where I am at the moment. The tasks to be done before my planned start date seem endless and overwhelming. New challenges show up daily to add to the list and some days seem to be beyond my control no matter how hard I try to keep a handle on things. I imagine that is how things are for most of us. Never enough time it seems to get everything done and as we get closer to our stepping off date things keep accelerating. The only way I know to handle that panicky feeling is to do as I do on my river trips. Keep your eyes fixed firmly on the goal downstream, paddle as fast as you can, do your best to avoid the rocks and try to keep yourself upright. The current will push you through the rapids either way. It is just a matter of what kind of shape you are in when you shoot out the other side. You, your boat and everything you started with will definitely end up downstream one way or the other.Each of our start dates are definitely going to arrive and most of us will feel like we are not quite ready. All we can do is what we can do. We will just have to trust that the current of life will move the rest along for us.

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520347,"A few nights ago while I was out feeding the horses, I watched a full moon rise over the ridge above our home. It occurred to me that I only have one more full moon before I leave my home and hit the trail. Today’s society is governed by the clock and we measure our lives by the passing of minutes and hours. In the past, time was measured by the phases of the moon and the passing of the seasons. The Native Americans kept track of the seasons by giving distinctive names to each recurring full moon. The name of each new full moon was applied to the entire month in which it occurred. What I was watching was the rise of the Wolf Moon. That means this month is the month of the Wolf. Next month’s moon will be the Snow Moon so February is the month of the Snow Moon.This way of measuring the passing of time sure seems more appropriate for the time we will be spending on the trail. What difference does a few more or less minutes, hours or days really make once we are hiking and living outdoors? Our lives will be dictated by the terrain, the seasons and the moon, not the clock. I am definitely looking forward to not having my daily life dictated by some cheap piece of manmade junk that emits an annoying noise regularly to remind us that we are running late for yet another meeting that really means nothing in the grand scheme of things. For anyone that is interested here is a list of the full moons for 2016 and the Native American names for each one:Jan. 23 - Wolf Moon Feb. 22 - Snow MoonMar. 23 - Worm MoonApr. 22 - Pink MoonMay 21 - Flower MoonJune 20 - Strawberry MoonJuly 19 - Buck MoonAug. 18 - Sturgeon MoonSept. 16 - Harvest MoonOct. 16 - Hunter's MoonNov. 14 - Beaver MoonDec. 13 - Cold MoonI will be starting my journey in the month of the Snow Moon. Maybe we will be able to watch one of the rising moons on the list together at a campsite sometime this year. One thing that is for sure is that no matter where we are, either on the trail or back home, when we watch the moon rise we are sharing it even if we are miles apart. That same moon is shining down on all of us no matter where we are at the time.Take care and maybe I will see you in the moonlight somewhere down the trail.",,The Month of the Wolf Moon,"Jan 28, Thu",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520458,"This morning during my training hike I was trying to remember the exact moment that I made the decision to attempt a through hike of the Appalachian Trail. Thoughts of the trail have been lingering in the shadows of my mind every since I became aware of it's existence back in 1975. After talking about it with the love of my life and getting her enthusiastic support, I made my declaration to family and friends during the Christmas holidays. I am sure that moment will end up being another of several pivotal moments in my life. I believe that when we look back at our lives, each of us can identify points in time that ended up being milestones or turning points in the direction our lives were heading.The Marine Corps places a lot of value on marching skills because it requires discipline and precision. Any of us that are part of the Marine brotherhood have spent countless hours practicing, drilling and learning the precise movements that you see whenever you watch a drill team do their stuff. Whenever a column of Marines need to make a left or right turn they don’t just ease around in a lazy curve to get it done. Once the command is given, each Marine places their foot on the exact turning point, pivots on the ball of their foot, then steps off at a 90 degree angle from the direction they were headed. That is what I envision when I think of a pivotal moment.Often circumstances in our lives cause us to deviate from our paths but I don’t believe that is what I would call a pivotal moment. That is more like a swerve to avoid a collision. Sometimes those life swerves save us from crashing and burning. Sometime a swerve ends up sending us into greener pastures. But often the swerves are a result of bad decisions on our part and send us off in a direction that we come to regret later. As I look back I can identify several moments that drastically changed my life and the direction it was taking. Some were definitely swerves but several were consciously executed pivot points that headed me toward better things. I know that my upcoming hike is definitely a pivotal moment. I knew it was time I changed my routine of working endless hours cleaning up my clients messes and start spending more time with my wife and family. I also wanted time to pursue my writing and my art. I knew that I had to make it happen! So being the old Marine that I am, I planted my foot firmly in front of me and pivoted 90 degrees out of my rut and onto the Appalachian Trail headed north.The hardest part is making the decision to make a major life change. We may hate the way things are. We may know that things are slowly robbing us of our joy. But a routine is comfortable even if it is an unhealthy one. The inertia of the known and familiar is strong and it takes courage to head off in a new direction on purpose. But I have found that once you do then the universe will mold itself to your new direction and you wonder why you didn’t make the change earlier.I guess this posting isn’t so much about hiking but I hope it rings true for someone reading it. These are just some thoughts that came to me this morning during my training hike and it felt right to share them here. If your decision to hike the trail this year represents a pivot point in your life also, then I am glad that our new directions will allow us to share the same path for a while. Take care and I will see you down the trail.",,A Pivot Point,"Jan 30, Sat",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520652,"I come from a long line of walkers. My aunts have compiled our family tree and apparently I have a relative that fought for the south in the Civil War even though he was living in what is now known as Texas at the time. A lot of people living here did not get involved in what they thought was not their concern at the time but he did. Eventually he was captured and placed in a prison camp in Virginia I think. Due to not wanting to pay to house prisoners, the Union decided to release some of them if they would sign a document swearing to not pick up arms against the North again. My ancestor gave his word to not reenter the fight, was released, then proceeded to walk back home to Texas. Unarmed, without provisions other than what he could procure along the way, he made it back home where he resumed his pre-war life. My grandfather and his brother were trappers in their twenties and trapped along the Rio Grande and Pecos Rivers in West Texas. This was in the early 1900’s so there were very few automobiles around, especially in our part of the West. As a matter of fact my grandfather told me about the first time that he and his brother encountered their first automobile while riding their horses. Apparently it turned into quite the rodeo. My grandfather and his brother traipsed around the canyons of West Texas while running their trap lines. Walking was the only way to get around because the country was too rough even for horses. They trapped for months at a time then built a raft and floated their furs out to the nearest town. Even later on when we had horses on the ranch, my grandfather still preferred walking to check fences and keep an eye on our livestock. So walking is in my blood! I may even cross the path that my ancestor took on his way back to Texas from the prisoner of war camp in the East at some point on my hike. When people hear about my plans to hike from Georgia to Maine, one of the first questions they ask, right after “Why would you want to do something like that?” is “How far will you walk each day?” I try to explain that there are a lot of variables that can affect the distance a hiker can cover in a day such as terrain, weather and physical stamina but that I am going to try to average 15 miles a day. They are shocked and can hardly imagine walking that far in a week, much less in a day. I guess most of us are that way if we really think about it. The car, or in my case the pickup, has become such a part of our lives that the thought of going anywhere on foot at less than 70 mph borders on craziness. I grew up on a ranch in West Texas and the closest two towns had a total combined population of maybe 800 people. In fact our school was spread across the two towns with grades 1 through 8 in one town and the high school in the other. I remember when my whole known world was pretty much the ranch and those two towns with a big trip being the 40 mile drive to haul livestock to the auction occasionally. These days we think that a 40 mile commute back and forth to work is reasonable and driving twice that far to go shopping or to catch a show is no big deal. Walking anywhere other than maybe for a few minutes in a park is not even considered.I have to think that even with our advances in technology and all the modern conveniences that we enjoy, we have managed to lose something important along the way. Shifting our focus from small communities and the friends and family that live there, to inviting the whole world into our lives through social media comes at a price. Exchanging driving down the highway at high speeds for traveling across the land by foot at the speed of smell, causes a lot of what we pass through to go unnoticed. Don’t get me wrong, I love technology and the advances that make possible the lives we lead. I just don’t want to lose the important stuff along the way. 
Looks like my fingers got long winded this morning with this post. Hopefully it doesn’t come off as rambling and incoherent. I think I will end this post with a quote from a Native American named Walking Buffalo. “Hills are always more beautiful than stone buildings. Living in a cityis an artificial existence. Lots of people hardly ever feel real soil undertheir feet, see plants grow except in flower pots, or get far enoughbeyond the street light to catch the enchantment of a night sky studdedwith stars. When people live far from scenes of the Great Spirit'smaking, it's easy for them to forget his laws.”~ Walking Buffalo ~",,A Walking Legacy,"Feb 03, Wed",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520893,"I am down to 16 days before I take my first step on the Appalachian trail. The different reactions of people when they hear about my upcoming through hike are interesting. My wife is my biggest supporter and I would not have even considered doing it if she had been against it. Other family members and friends seem pretty much ambivalent about it. They have a passing interest in the novelty of the idea but that seems to be the extent of it. I think I fall somewhere in between a carnival side show and ""The Thing"" you see advertised on billboards for hundreds of miles along Interstate 10 between Texas and California. Their nterest in my trip is definitely not in competition with Duck Dynasty or The Housewives of (pick a city). That's ok with me. It is my journey and my quest.What is surprising is the excitement and support I get from people I have never met before. As word spreads about my hike, people I hadn't previously known tell me how awesome the idea of hiking 2200 miles across the country is and often share how they wished they could do something like it. A few have told me that they have always wanted to hike the trail but due to various reasons they never could. They love talking about it and are curious about everything having to do with the hike.This happened again a couple of days ago. I met a young lady while having some new tires installed on my truck. She knew all about the Appalachian Trail and loved the idea of hiking it. Her excitement was contagious and when I left the shop I was as pumped up as she was about the adventure I was about to embark on. Any doubts I may have had faded away. She was not aware of the gift of encouragement that she had given me that day.I have come to realize that in addition to all the gear, food and water we have to carry in our packs, we are also carrying the dreams of others. For each one of us that manage to realize our dream of a thru hike, there are many more that have to enjoy the adventure vicariously through our journals, verbal accounts and books. Luckily the dreams of those that are unable to join us on the hike do not weigh heavily in our packs. To the contrary, I find that they actually help to lighten the load and wash away any worries and doubts the start of a new adventure often brings. We are hiking not only for ourselves, but also for those who, for whatever reason, are unable to turn their dream into reality.So when we are loading up to head for the trail, let's all save a bit of room in our packs and in our hearts to tuck away the dreams of those that want to share our adventure. When we are hiking our hike, we are also hiking the hike of others.Take care and I will see you down the trail soon!",,Carrying the Dreams of Others,"Feb 09, Tue",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520992,"Just for fun I thought I would post this:This is a story of long ago in the time after Raven pried open the giant clam shell and allowed The People to emerge into the world. It was in the time after Raven hung the Sun, the Moon and all of the stars in the heavens so The People would have light in their dark world. Raven loved The People and watched them go about their lives as she soared high above them in the sky. Through many seasons Raven flew in the four directions as far as she could and explored the lands of the world. Though Raven loved The People, she longed for another that she could share her life and adventures with. One day as she sat in the top of a tall pine tree and looked out over the ocean, she wondered what was on the other side of the water. Even though she had flown over all of the land, she had never tried to fly over the water to see what was on the other side. “It is time” she thought to herself. So Raven spread her giant black wings and soared out over the ocean to see what she could find. She flew for days and grew very tired because she could find no place to land and rest. With each passing day she grew weaker and weary. Finally she saw something far below her. It was not land but it looked like a log floating in the water. She had to rest so she swooped down and landed on the large black log among the waves of the ocean. She was so tired that she started to doze in the hot sun. Suddenly she heard a voice that seemed to come from the log. “Who are you?” asked the booming voice. “I am Raven” she said. “I am the one The People call The Bringer of the Light”. “Who is talking” she asked loudly! Just then she saw a huge eye open in the log and look at her.“I am Whale” said the log. “I am called The Traveler by The People. I swim in all of the waters of the world and pass by the lodges of The People every season while hunting”.“You must see many wondrous things as you dive under the waters” Raven said. “As do you as you fly over the land” Whale replied. “Why are you on my back”?“I longed to see what was on the other side of the water” Raven answered. “I grew so tired and was afraid I would not make it until I saw you and stopped to rest for a while”.“I have always wondered what there was to see upon the land beyond the shore” said Whale.So Raven and Whale stayed together for days sharing with each other all of the wonders they had both seen. Soon a storm appeared with ferocious winds that washed huge waves over the back of Whale. Raven struggled to stay on his back but was almost washed off many times.“If you stay on top of my back you will die” Whale said. “I will open my mouth and you can fly inside of my belly and be safe from the storm.” So that is exactly what Raven did! She flew inside of Whale and snuggled up to his enormous heart and was safe and warm. Days turned to weeks and weeks turned into years as Raven and Whale explored the world together. With each passing day they became closer and closer and grew to love each other very much. They traveled over the waters and lands of the world. They grew so close that Raven could see the beautiful sights under the oceans through Whale’s eyes and Whale could feel and see what Raven felt and saw as she soared over the land. Time passed and the two grew so close that The People came to think of them as one. They started to tell stories about how Raven and Whale bonded together and became RavenWhale. They made carvings and paintings showing Whale with Raven tucked safely inside his belly next to his heart.That is the story of how love bound together two completely different beings and the result was the creation of something even more beautiful and wondrous. Some believe that RavenWhale is still exploring the world even today.",,The Legend of RavenWhale,"Feb 11, Thu",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521258,"Things are coming down to the wire now. Of course the things that need to be done before I climb on the plane to Atlanta seem to keep piling up. I keep feeling that I need to push my start date forward so I can get everything done before I leave. I discussed this with my wife and she told me that even if I changed the start date that when it got close again the same thing would happen. There will always be something or someone else to take care of. She is right! I am so grateful I married a wise woman who just also happens to be my best friend. So my start date stays at February 25th, come hell or high water. It seems the problems are multiplying the closer I get to my start date. We received word yesterday that a cousin of mine took his own life. It is such a sad thing when a person gets it in their mind that the only option they have in life is to end it. It is especially so when they are a young adult with kids. It is beyond my understanding how someone can get to that point. My personal belief system does not even allow that as an option. Even though I am buried in last minute preparations for my hike, for some reason I feel the need to hammer out a post about this. I learned long ago that usually the reason I feel strongly to write about something is that it will speak to someone that needs to hear it. So please bear with me as I deviate from the subject of hiking for a bit.Life is tough and we all pick up battle scars along the way. I love to sail and I often think that life is like sailing a boat in the ocean. In a sailboat you never just head from point A to point B. You may have a good idea where you want to go but, just as in life, a lot can happen between your starting point and when you pull into your final port. Some days are sunny with nice light breezes and you think they will last forever. Just as you are getting comfortable and feeling at ease, a storm will appear on the horizon. You have no choice but to suck it up, batten down the hatches and deal with it until you come out into the sunshine again. As all sailors know, no matter how heavy the seas, you know that if you can keep sailing, you will eventually get through it. You just know, without a doubt, that there is a warm beach somewhere on the other side of the mess you are in the middle of.Rough times are just part of this crazy thing we call life. I have definitely weathered my share of life’s storms and a few times I have almost lost my way. I have had failed relationships, hard financial times and the loss of a child. At some point all of us will get kicked in the stomach by life! At that point we have a choice. We can lay there in our misery or we can struggle to get back up, even though everything within us is telling us to give up. Speaking from experience, I have found that if you can get back on your feet and stay in the fight, things will get better. You may not FEEL like you have won but you will have survived to fight another day. You just have to KNOW that if you can just hang on and keep going, you will get to fair weather again.One thing I know for sure! When you are in the middle of a storm, whether sailing or in life, if you give up and punch a hole in your boat, you will never make it to that warm sunny beach on the other side of the heavy seas you are dealing with. You may not be able to see the blue skies through the dark storm clouds and pouring rain, but they are there. Just keep sailing! I did and I came out the other side into the sunshine and warmth. For everyone that is fighting a battle, feeling weary and wondering if it is worth it to keep going, I am proof that there is something better waiting for you if you will just hang in there. Here I am married to a fantastic woman and about to live my dream of hiking the Appalachian Trail! Things I could not even begin to think of as a possibility not that long ago. I am sure most people that know me would tell you that I survived because I am hard headed and stubborn. I will take that. Hey it worked for me! The main thing is to put your head down and keep moving forward! Ignore the impulses to quit and lay down. Get mad and bull your way on through to something better!Just do your best to keep your boat upright and moving forward, no matter how slowly you feel you are moving, and you will get through it. One day you will come out of the other side of your own personal storm and feel the warmth of sunshine on your face. Looking back on it, you will know that it was worth it to keep going. So get mad, give whatever you are going through the finger and push on through! The weather is great on this side of the storm. Who knows, maybe our ships or trails will cross at some point down life’s trail. If so I look forward to seeing you and we can compare scars.Take care and I will see you down the trail very soon!",,Keep On Sailing!,"Feb 16, Tue",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521955,"Unfortunately I had to delay my start by one week. I underestimated how much work it would be to shut down and move the office I have been in for eleven years. I also had to wrap up some business dealings before I left. My wife and I were working deep into the night every night trying to get everything done. The stress was leaching the joy right out of the whole adventure. The final straw was when I was carrying yet more boxes from my office to my truck and lightening suddenly lit up the sky and rain started pouring down. It finally dawned on me that I was the one that picked my start date so I had the power to change it if I wanted to. Duh! I had been so focused on February 25th that I never considered any other options. I was going to fly out on the 24th no matter how hard it was on me, my wife or anyone else. I stepped back into my office and called the Hiker Hostel. They graciously changed my reservations and promised to hold onto my gear until I got there. I went online and changed my flight to March 1st. The whole process took about 15 minutes. All of the stress that was weighing me down suddenly dissolved and the joy was back. It turned out that my original flight ended up being canceled due to bad weather anyway. The line of storms that swept through West Texas and caused my flight to be canceled, also went across the rest of the south and did a lot of damage. I guess the trail is teaching me lessons even before I take my first step on it. Lesson #1: When your body is telling you that the pressure is getting to be too much and you need to do something about it, LISTEN! Lesson #2: When God and Mother Nature are sending you signs and warnings, PAY ATTENTION! Lesson #3: Don't be so focused on something that you end up with tunnel vision and never consider any other ideas or options.And the final lesson was that if the path you are on is robbing you of your joy, CHANGE COURSE! Or in my case, change the date.So that is my current status and why you have not seen me post from the trail yet. I have completed my business dealings and am getting to enjoy spending a few extra days with my wife before heading to Georgia. Amazing how something as simple as moving a date forward by a week changed everything!I want to send out a big Thank You to everyone that has been posting in my guest book and sending me emails. I appreciate all of your kind words about my blog and journal. Take care and I will see you down the trail soon.... with my joy once again firmly in place.",,Launch Delay,"Feb 27, Sat",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522597,Unfortunately I have to announce that my hike has been interrupted by an injury to my ankle while on the trail. I was making my way from the Hawk Mountain Shelter and headed to Gooch Mountain. On the climb up Sassafras Mountain it began to snow and the wind began to blow. By the time I was on the ridge it was a full blown blizzard with wet snow and wind. I rolled my ankle a couple of times on rocks under the snow and took a fall on some icy rocks. When I fell I twisted my ankle badly and my old injuries resurfaced. It was snowing so hard that I had about made the decision to rig up my tarp and shelter up to wait out the storm. A young man came along on the trail with very little gear and was soaking wet so we decided to make our way down to Coopers Gap and call for a shuttle. Hikers were trying to get to safety everywhere and on the ride to town there were numerous cars blocking the roads and in the ditches. I spent two days in a motel in town and was hoping my ankle would mend so I could get back on the trail. That didn't happen and the swelling got worse. I have made the decision to fly back to Texas and get it checked and let it mend. Hopefully I will be able to hit the trail later even though it would mean doing a flip flop. The people I met on the trail were great and the hiking is fantastic. I appreciate everyone that follows my journal and I will keep you posted on what happens with my ankle. Take care and hopefully I will see you down the trail later.,"Launch Delay

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523020,"I just wanted to bring everyone up to date and clarify what happened to me on the trail. To say that things did not go as planned is an understatement. I flew into Atlanta on schedule and caught the MARTA train to the North Springs Station. Leigh from Hiker Hostel picked me up along with two other hikers and hauled us back to the hostel. Leigh and Josh have a great place to stay and they go out of their way to serve hikers.The next morning after feeding us all breakfast, they hauled us out to our respective start points. For me it was the Springer Mountain parking lot. I hiked up to the start point then headed back across the parking lot to Hawk Mountain shelter. We had a cold and windy night at the shelter but my gear all performed well. I was as snug as a bug in a rug in my tarp, hammock and quilts. The next morning I headed out with Gooch Mountain shelter as my planned stopping point for the night. The forecast called for light rain in the afternoon and some of the fast hikers set out very early in an attempt to make the shelter before the rain hit. I was headed up Sassafras Mountain when it started to snow. By the time I was up on the ridge, it was coming down hard and the trail was buried in white stuff. The temperature began to drop and things got slick. I slipped on some rocks that I did not see under the snow and fell. I cranked my ankle pretty good but didn't think I was hurt too badly. The snow showed no signs of slowing down so I had made the decision to hang my tarp and hammock to get out of the wind and snow. I figured I would just shelter up and ride it out. About that time a young man came along and since he had very little gear we decided to make our way down to Cumberland Gap and call in for a pickup. He was wearing a cotton hoody with no gloves and no hat. By the time we got off the mountain my ankle was throbbing. Josh from the Hiker Hostel picked us up and we drove around picking up other hikers that were seeking shelter from the storm also. I checked into the Days Inn in town and spent a couple of days soaking and icing my ankle. I hoped it would get better and I could get back on the trail. The swelling actually increased so I figured I would catch a flight back to Texas and get it checked. So that is exactly what I did. It took me a couple of days to get in to see the doctor. The doctor checked my ankle out yesterday and told me that I had a Ganglion Cyst from prior damage to the tendons that ballooned up when I hurt it. I also had a bad sprain which accounted for another bulge behind my ankle bone. My main concern was how long before I could head back to the trail. When I asked him this he told me that it was a crazy idea and that he would not even guess when or if I would be able to hike long distances again. My plan now is to work on getting healed up and start doing some rehab on my ankle. I have a target date of April 15 to try to get back on the trail again. Between now and then I plan to do everything I can to strengthen my ankle and stack the odds in my favor. I figure that since I am restarting in April, I can dump some of my cold weather gear to get my pack weight down. I also plan to cut my body weight as much as possible and that will be easier on my joints as well. I am finding it hard to face the fact that the days are over when I could just push past a little pain and discomfort and will my body to do what it is told. Physical limitations are a hard thing to accept. So since I can't just bull my way through injuries like I have in the past I will try to use my head and try to accommodate it to get moving again. I appreciate all of the well wishes and words of encouragement from everyone. Even though things are not going according to my plan, I think they may be going according to THE PLAN and will work out in the end. I will be following everyone else that is on the trail and starting soon. I will continue to post in my journal as things come to me. Let me know if I can be of help to anyone while I am recuperating. Take care, happy hiking and be safe!","

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523714,"I passed the tree in the photo between Springer Mountain and Hawk Mountain. It inspired this poem that I started on the trail and finished today while sitting here at home letting my ankle heal. Thanks to everyone that sent me well wishes in my guest book and email. I am still on track to get back on the trail on April 15th. See you down the trail soon.“I Met An Elder Today”By RavenWhaleI met an Elder today as I walked along the trail,I lingered a while in his presence, hoping he would tell me a tale;Just to the side he stood, silent, stoic and strong.I hoped for a bit of wisdom before I had to move along.Proud as an old Chief he stood, young tribal members all around,Impatiently, I waited to be enlightened, but he uttered not a sound. I could see the scars of battles past upon his ancient face,Then I shouldered my pack and chided myself, for the time I did waste.As I made to go and resume my journey, along the North bound path, I paused and looked again at the Elder’s scar, created by natures wrath.Amongst the sounds of wind and rustling leaves, I thought I heard someone speak.I heard him quietly whisper, “Come closer. I have the knowledge that you seek.”“Daily battles and challenges are a part of this life” I felt him say,“But the score doesn’t really matter at the end of the day.“It matters not that some battles you lose and some you win,As long as you are still standing, proud and true, in the end”.“Injuries from battles lost are temporary, they will heal with each passing season,To morn the past or what could have been, is fruitless and without reason,And with each scar and wrinkle that appears, a bit of wisdom is yours to gain.For knowledge and wisdom is treasure earned, and is always worth the pain.I thanked the Old One and turned to go, stumbling in my haste,“Don’t be in such a hurry friend! We all are headed to the same place!And as I walked away I heard him whisper once again in the wind,“Because all living things end up as dust, and become part of each other in the end.”","

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524333,"“John Steinbeck once wrote: “A journey is like a marriage. The certain way to be wrong is to think you control it.” This is a tough lesson that I have been learning these past couple of weeks with my foot propped up. I had my hike all planned out including the number of miles I intended to hike and a time table of where I planned to be at the end of the each day. Silly me! I thought I was in control of everything. A freak snow storm and falling and spraining my ankle were definitely not part of the plan. Neither was having to fly back home to let my injury heal. I was extremely frustrated the first few days back home. Having to abort my hike only a couple of days into it is a hard pill to swallow. After getting over my initial disappointment, I have come to realize that the fall and injury are also part of the journey. At least they are part of MY journey. Everyone must travel their own path and live their own experiences along the way. We can all walk down the exact same path but it will be different for each of us.I had worked like a dog right up to the morning I caught the flight to Atlanta. I left feeling stressed out and worrying that I had forgotten to take care of some things before I left. Since I have had to take the time and let my ankle recover, I have been able to make sure everything is in good shape before I leave again. By the time I get back on the trail my mindset will be completely different. It took me a couple of days, but I figured out that being pissed over the situation accomplished nothing. After I relaxed and loosened my grip on things I was able to stand back and see the good also.If I had not had to come back to recover from my injury, I would have missed the extra time I got to spend with my awesome wife. I would have also missed the visit from our two friends from British Columbia and the fun we had. I was so focused on the details of the hike and making it to Maine that I had forgotten to enjoy the journey itself and to embrace whatever the journey brings along the way. I am not saying that I am glad that my fall happened, but I can appreciate the good that came from it. So my goal now is to continue to heal so I can get back on the trail soon. But even more important is my intent to enjoy the journey however it unfolds.I remember years ago when my daughter was just a toddler. I handed her a baby bunny to hold and she loved it. Soon I realized that she was holding it way too tight and if I had not taken it from her the bunny would have probably died. She loved it so much she was squeezing the life out of it. Dreams are a lot like that baby bunny. If we hold them too tight we can end up squeezing the life out of them. And if we try to control every aspect of a journey we end up squeezing the joy out of it also. What we end up with is but a shell of what we wanted. It might resemble what we wanted but a lot of the good stuff is missed and falls to the wayside.I feel that life is just like the Appalachian Trail. There is joy and a sense of accomplishment in reaching the end of the trail, but if we focus solely on the end, we miss all the beauty we walk through to get there. So I plan to enjoy this journey for however long it lasts and wherever it takes me. I hope you can do the same. Savor every moment and glean every bit of joy you can out of each day no matter what journey you are on.Take care and I will see you down the trail.","Healing Up.

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535555,"Well I had hoped to be back on the Appalachian Trail by now. My ankle has pretty much recovered except for a lump on the side which the doc says will not be going away without surgery. I still get twinges of pain if I twist it a certain way but nothing that stops me from hiking. I had planned on heading back in April, then pushed it back to May but as is often the case, life happened. A combination of personal, business and financial issues came up that required my attention and if I had not already been off the trail I would probably have had to leave it anyway to deal with things.I have decided to put my plan to through hike the trail this year on hold and have another go at it next spring. By then I am hoping to have all the issues that have come up taken care of and I can step off in 2017 without having to worry about obligations at home while tackling the challenge of a through hike attempt. So it is with great disappointment and a heavy heart that I am leaving the class of 2016 and joining the class of 2017 through hikers. Thanks to everyone that has sent me words of encouragement and asked how things are going. I plan to keep my journal going under the Appalachian Trail 2017 section and I am encouraged by the positive comments I have received about my journal. To everyone still on the trail this year, take care and I will be following your journals. To those of you that, like me, had to leave the trail this year, don’t despair. The trail will be there when you are ready again. We are all hiking our own hike no matter how long or short it is or where it takes us. Who knows? Maybe your trail will cross mine next spring!","
