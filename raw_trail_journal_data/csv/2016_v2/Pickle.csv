Pickle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480434,"2 pages. For the past 13 or so years I have concentrated too much my life around 2 pages. Making them the best two pages I can. Not the best in my mind, but the best in my perception of what I believe others are looking for. Too many times I have seen things for how they can improve my two pages, and not how they can improve my life. One cannot simply explain themselves in two pages. Human beings are more than anything that can be summarized in two simple pages. We are complex and varied. We are not our past, we are who we are. We cannot do justice to ourselves in simply 2 pages. We owe it to ourselves, to our friends and family, to be more than 2 pages. My obsession with building my resume has come at the expense of my own happiness. It's time to change that.",,2 pages,"Jan 22, Thu",0
Pickle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481105,"Lauren and I embarked on a journey to make a down quilt. While researching a new sleeping bag I went down the rabbit hole from synthetic to down, bag to quilt, quilt to holy crap those are expensive! So we spoke about it and she agreed to help me by basically doing all the hard work, the sewing. I did some research and ended up with a shipment of 850 down and nylon for about $180. I decided to go with 2.5"" baffles to make an estimated 20* quilt. It took 10 hours over the course of a few days. We probably wasted 3 ours the first day just laying it out, a few times before actually cutting the first half of the shell. It turned out great! She did an awesome job sewing it and dealing with me watching. I can't wait to test it out!",,"DIY Quilt, Check!","Feb 06, Fri",0
Pickle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481671,"I have given the down quilt some use over the past few days, although strictly indoors. It is definitely more than I hope to ever need in regards to warmth. I typically end up half in and half out of from under it. I think it will definitely do the trick this coming spring. I also started looking into hammock set ups. With my current tent (BA Copper Spur 2 UL) coming in at 50 oz without a footprint, I'm second guessing its usefulness on a thru hike. I am entertaining testing out a hammock this spring and summer. I preordered the ENO Sub7 from REI, and also a suspension set up from Arrowhead Equipment. One of my concerns with hammock camping is rain and keeping dry at night. I don't like the idea of being stuck huddling under a small tarp to cook eat and relax. I also wonder if I should keep my Thermarest xLite for use in shelters or switch to a UQ for the hammock. Spring cannot come soon enough!",,Sanity,"Feb 16, Mon",0
Pickle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481810,"My decision to ""exit stage right"" from my job has been relatively easy. Decisions are easy, the follow through is the hard part. I plan to thru hike the At starting in the spring of 2016. About 14 months from now. For the next 14 month I am saving as much money as possible to finance my hike as well as give me enough cushion post hike to find a new path in life. I like what I do most days; I like the people I work with. I just have no drive anymore. I have become a corporate zombie whore. 5 years ago I filled out a silly Fakebook(see what I did there?) survey/facts about my life. One fact was ""I hate my job most days and talk about quitting or a career change daily, I don't think I'll quit in the next 5 years."" It's funny to look back at that post now after a friend reminded me what it said and think what the hell have I been waiting for? I have switched jobs twice since then, both for excellent companies. I am living in my 3rd state since that post, back close to my family which is nice. But I know this path I am on isn't for me. I need to do something I love and forget about the resume, and forget about the pay checks. I read a post titled Miles vs Smiles here (http://appalachiantrials.com/milesvssmiles/) and it's a great article. It reminded me that we can get the best of both worlds; we just need to be willing to do what it takes to get it. For me itâ€™s going to be getting out of my corporate slave hood and getting back to happiness.",,Sanity,"Feb 17, Tue",0
