Bambi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523816,"Woke up early to get a jump on the day. early means 5:30, when people start wrestling around getting their stuff together have their coffee and on the road by 7 o'clock. The goal was Unico Gap just under 10 miles away with several tough up hills in one big downhill at the end. The end of the hike was where Highway cross the trail and a parking lot was located for day hikers. We found Trail magic a local Baptist Church set up grills and provided burgers and chips and drinks for free sent you a picture of that already. Got a shuttle into town and decided like many others to have a 0 Day on Sunday. Good day to choose because it seem to rain a lot on and off all day and I was able to catch up on a lot of sleep. The plan for tomorrow is to get an early start on the day take the shuttle up to where we left off and start the long uphill ending about 13 miles down the trail. This will be my single longest hike to date. I was able to dictate this because I'm still under the hotel Wi-Fi so excuse the typos.","
