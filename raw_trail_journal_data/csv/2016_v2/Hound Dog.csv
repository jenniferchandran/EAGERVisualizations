Hound Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482041,"So I've decided to hike the A.T. in it's entirety.
Why? Well it's a bucket list thing for one thing and there's a few others but we'll get to those later
Gear
I'm debating in whether or not to go with the BioLite stove. I like the convenient feeling that I can charge my phone, GPS or kindle when I want and not be dependent on when the next town is and is there a place that I can charge it. I ordered the North Face cats meow bag which is great excluding one thing. I don't fit in it. I'm a large mammal and this fart sack just isn't wide enough in the shoulders. So a trip to REI is in order not only to exchange the bag but to fit some boots. I have a ways to go as far as equipment. 
Water filtration is another concern. I have the katadyn hiker filter but I'm not sure if that's gonna be enough. I've thought about the steri pen but worry if there's a lot if sediment then I have to worry about giardia and what not . Ugh. I know I'm gonna keep some iodine tabs for emergency but I worry about weight. I saw the other chlorine type tabs and they seem to be an option but I worry about being able to find them on the trail.
Clothes is another thing. I have a limited idea of what I should pack and how much. How many base layers, how many pants, shirts, what kind? I'm hoping the folks at REI will be able to get this figured without me having to leave an arm and a leg, my first born and my soul. I understand decent gear ain't cheap but I'm looking for a happy medium. I am seriously considering hiking in a kilt .
Bounce boxes is another concern. Should I use them ? Where do I get the address for these places and what if I forgot to stop at a place? I don't think I'm gonna use them except for places where a town is far away .
This Monday I start training and attempting to lose weight . I have so much I have to do. 
Well I suppose this will do for now and I guess my trail name is locked in .","at home

Hound Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482373,"Loaded everything in my pack and weighed it. Right now with two quarts of water and about 4 days of food I'm weighing in around 33 pounds but I'm pretty sure I can get that down to around 30 by go time. That's pretty good but while weighing my pack I also weighed me. 
I need to lose shed some pounds before I hit the trail. 
Ilose weight fast but I imagine less chunk means less wear and tear on the joints and easier miles. Although I'm physically active with Jitsu and Judo I have not just done any straight cardio and it's showing. 
So what to do about it?
Well today I started eating healthier and said goodbye to my beloved mountain dew lol
I'm going to hit the YMCA again here soon and as soon as this arctic freeze is up I'm going to be doing a few day hikes throughout the week and gradually increase my range as I get stronger
(and thinner ) I may also haul the treadmill out of the mothballs and get my big ass on that as well. 
It's my intention to do everything I can do to insure I finish my thru hike.","NOBO AT HIKE

Hound Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482554,"So today I had the riveting experience of ordering sock liners (something a few experience hikers are highly suggesting) and hiking socks. My god is decent gear pricey. IDE decided to try and she'd some more weight by switching to chemical water purification. That will help me shed at least a few more pounds. I'm hoping to hit REI some time in the next couple weeks to get a sleeping bag, pack and boots. This will be a challenge because I have giant feet, I'm to wide for most hiking bags (found this out when I tried to squeez into my cats meow bag) and I'm picky about my packs. I am however really looking forward to trying my gear out come this spring would should be in a few weeks but looking out the window it appears to be another hundred years if arctic terror. 
I remain stoically hopeful
I am also wondering about finding a hiking partner. I imagine there will be people met along the way but maybe this is just the chickenshit in me. I also bought the 2015 AWOL Hiking Guide. This is probably a futile attempt to familiarize my forgetful ass with terrains, possible food drops and other nomenclature of the trail. I think some if it will stick.","home

Hound Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482751,Well this ol ' Hound dog is officially now a Grandfather !!!The little pup weighed in at 8 pounds 10 ounces and was 21 inches long. He is gorgeous !!! I'm proud and a little stunned . It's been awhile since I've had a youngster in my life. So now that the boy is here we can head down to REI to find a fart sack that fits and a new pack !!! I love gear and although I'm not a gram weenie I am trying to keep my weight down. Still undecided about doing the bounce boxes,"crazy

Hound Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483132,"So I didn't make it to REI for a sleeping bag fitting it was a long weekend with minimal sleep and when I get the REI I'd like to be able to spend some time there and get my chunky mammalian mass fitted with some boots, new bag, rain gear (that's another post ""there's no such thing as bad weather just Inappropriate clothing"") and base layers. Anywho I'd like to be able to enjoy myself there so I'm putting it off till next week.
I got my sock liners, socks, and this years AWOL Guide Book. I got the latter so I could familiarize myself with it and get some address's for possible mail drops. BTW WHAT A FOUNTAIN OF USEFUL INFO !!!! i been worrying about being able to navigate to towns for resupply and find my way around off the trail, be able to see what resources are close by and yada yada yada (you get the picture) So I been toying with the idea of getting a fancy GPS with all the fixings but I'm reading it's better to just save money for the trail. Anywho after familiarizing my ignorant arse with AWOLS masterpiece I got to fingering out I already have a fancy GPS !!! My dang IPhone. The phone is constantly attatched to the net so uploads are as recent as it gets. I tested to see if I could search out the Gap names of where the trail leaves and if it would load directions to the listed names of hostels that the guide book lists and it does !!! Between what my phone has and an app I had purchased earlier this year (ALLTRAILS) AWOLS book and a compass I imagine I'm gonna be golden. The app is kinda spotty and a touch glitchy but when it still is pretty dang handy. So navigation wise I imagine I'm good.
To my any folks who read this and post a question or have previously I still ain't fingered out how to reply to the guest book and my apologizes but I was tickled pink to find a few was reading and following and I been following almost all of us 2016 folk. 
I got so much to do and I know I got an entire year but I'd like most of my shtuff because I'm hoping to gear test everything on the NCT this summer in the fall, summer and spring and my God am I aching for things to thaw out. Been a long hard bitter winter in NWPA this year. 
I reckon that's about all I got for today. I'm feeling chatty and could probably post something a mile long today but I got stuff to do and things to figure.","crazy

Hound Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483343,"So I started getting ready for next years hike. I loaded up a 30 pound pack and set out for a short 4 mile hike. He hike went well but learned a few things quickly, firstly and foremost need to ""grease up"" oh my !!! Thank God for my tub. I'd feel pretty sorry for the hiker that gets monkey butt on the trail. Also I still need to loose some serious weight. The hike went great and I felt like I coulda kept going for another 4 but I got jitsu practice tonight so I'll be hurting tonight . Vitamin I is for dinner. I also was curious to see how little clothes I needed at 40 degrees. Also want to see how long it takes those clothes to dry. I'm hoping by the time I hot the trail I can do at least 12 miles a day. I know 4 ain't much but not gonna start out like a dinkus and end up with shin splints and a stress fracture and further delay any training or my start date.Planning on another 4 miles tomorrow. Next week it 'll be 4.5 then stay there for about two weeks then try 6 and stay there for about 3 weeks.Got my pack organized today !!! Decided to skip the water filtration and just go with the chemical stuff to save weight but I worry about it killing all my good gut bacteria. Anywho my goal is a. 35 pound pack with food and my biolite. Beleive it or not I'm not far off. Anywho I may get a new marmot bag. Something just a tad bigger. Still ain't got my shoes yet and want to do that and be sure they're the brand I want then I'll buy 3 pair of them and get them broke in. Thinking sandals for in camp. As for what I'm gonna wear it's going to be a mishmash of swimwear and light weight base layers with some frog togs and a light weight coat. I'll pick the guys at REI 's brains and hopefully get some help from them","Lord Knows

Hound Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483433,"I did 5 today with a 40 pound pack and it's pretty easy. I may jump up to 8 next week and see how it feels. I'm loading canned goods in my pack to get the weight up. I want to train with a pack that's actually heavier than what I'm gonna carry. I'm hoping to work up to a 45 or 50 pound pack and be doing 8 to 10 miles a day and maybe every three days do a 12. I'm not sure gotta listen to my body.
Still need a few things for the trip and gotta get those funds built up. I want no excuses for quitting. I've also been experimenting with foot care. Today I tried to use silicone on my feet let that get tacky then molesking over top. Sounds good but didn't work. I have been using sock liners and they work well but when these blisters show up I want to be prepared. I'm gonna look on youtube and see what I come up with.
Feeling strong but having some chaffing issues by my bumper. Gonna switch my undies or go commando. I hate to do the latter though, I like the idea of there being a safety net and not freckling the back of my under armor everytime I let one roar. 
Anywho I'll take take some pics of me and my pup next time we head out.","the AT eventually

I am so glad I decided to be in shape before the trail because I imagine those who don't have got to have a much higher percentage rate for dropping out. I mean I would trudge on but I can't imagine what misery that'd be. Definitely gonna keep training","hoping to do some gear testing in the NCT THIS AP

She was born with severe a severe heart defect she is fighting for her life and if (and when) she survives tomorrow's surgery she will have a long road to recovery. Hiker folks I'm just asking for prayers, positive thoughts or good vibes. The baby's name is Amelia 
On a bit of a different note I'm in Pittsburgh so after I leave I'll be heading to REI to exchange my bag and pick up a few things. Got a lot on my mind and ain't gonna enjoy this as much as I should. 
Trout camp is just around the corner and it's only a hundred yards from the NCT so I'm gonna do a big piece of hiking (probably about 16 miles worth) then spend a few days alongside the creek casting for some brookies and rainbows. All this depending on what goes on here with my niece and my sister.","magee's childrens hospital

One sick dog
Got my stamp for when I sign in on trail logs !!! I'll post a pic, it's awesome.
I am debating on if I could take one of my dogs. As I train this summer and do a few 3 and 4 day trips it will help me decide.
UPDATE ON MY NIECE
*She has survived her first open heart surgery. I guess there's two more to go. We remain hopeful*
I worry that some of my journal may read like a Facebook account and all I have to say is this is my journey and for about the next year my ""journey"" is family life, financial prep, training, learning and gear gathering. But I guess the hike your own hike falls to pre hike and journals as well.
Planning a big NCT hike soon. I'll keep ya updated","home

The Ol"" Lady (a term of endearment between us) has found she has a significant illness that will follow her for the rest of her days. We are currently working to get this under control and are making headway but damn if I could make a list of the things we've been through in the last two years y'all wouldn't believe it. I ain't putting this down here because I'm some ""woe is me drama queen sissy boy"" This truly has been and is what I'm dealing with in my life and this is part of my path to. . . .ahhhhhhhh. . . . . . . To the path. LoLRegardless I'm undaunted and remain resolute in my decision to be a thru hiker in 2016 and my girl is supportive. Got the tent set up and I'm trying to embrace what a one person hiking tent is in size and comfort. Lord help me. As soon as the weather turns warm lI'll switch to a hammock. I'm still undecided on my stove, I got a biolite and yes I know they're heavy but I don't have to worry about running out of fuel and I can charge my stuff. If I lose the biolite it will save 4 pounds and I will end up taking my trangia alcohol stove. I also still need to decide on a mat, right now I have a walmart foam pad with a layer of refecttex glued to it for insulation and a layer of cushion. It works great and is light as a feather but I keep hearing about these other fancier pads. I'll check them out and see.","Lord Knows
