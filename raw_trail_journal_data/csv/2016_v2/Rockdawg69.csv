Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535586,"Always a tough time on first few days. No different this trip. Re-started trail at Pallisades Pkwy at 0830, finished at 1700. High temps (90s) and high humidity made for a tough day.Mega crowds on Bear Mountain and surrounding trails. Cramps on this first day several times despite drinking 4 quarts of water, with some Gatorade mix. Met a few thru hikers, Newton, Spidee, and 2 young ladies hiking with him. A few section folks out also. Got a few pics with vista from West Mtn Toward Bear Mtn. 
Saw a series of rock buttresses along the old road section of SW side of Bear Mountain approach. See Photos. Probably constructed by the CCC is my best guess. Really fine rock construction methods. Not sure they were needed as the rock ledge they support seems to be a massive chunk of the mountain that is not sliding. Dip of rock was into the mountain, meaning it would have to fracture to slide.
As a side issue, that bird that followed(?) me on my other trips from GA to VA is back. Beginning to think it is a ""spirit bird"" that has decided to accompany me as I travel the trail. I'll take that anytime as a good omen.
Not much else to report.","West Point, NY

Not much out here but hills and dales - that be "" ups and downs"" for all you flatlander folks. Hard on an old dawg. Just keep chugging along as best you can.Heard a turkey hen clucking to her chicks just ahead of me about 1000. She just kept moving them along until she got them behind a big rock off the trail. Never got to see them. About 1/2 mile from Dennytown site, I came across a copperhead lying directing on the trail. About 18-inches long and perfectly still. Glad I was watching my footing.

Stopped at Stormville, NY for lunch at Toni's deli. Big turkey sub and Gatorade. Added an extra mile(not counted as trail mile) today but it was well worth the effort.Stopped at Morgan Stewart shelter around 1400 for a rest and snacks. Can not set around all afternoon doing nothing so moved on another 7.5 miles to Telephone Pioneers Shelter. Stopped at Nuclear lake and ate the rest of the sub sandwich. Lots of Canada geese and goslings on the lake along with ducks. Decided I did not need to go to Pawling NY for resupply.Got in at 1915 and met crew already there - Wiskers, Sprout, Bubbles, Karma, and Montain Man. Last 2 are couple from Switzerland on an around the world trip.This was a long mileage day but it put me back on my planned schedule. Hope I don't do this again. Also, one of the most acoustically bad days ever due to Taconic State Pkwy and I-84 sandwiching in Hosner Mtn travel. Vehicle noise most of the day.","RPH Shelter

The result of a long day yesterday and not eating an evening meal. Bad judgment. Lesson learned - again.Passed the ""famous"" Dover Oak (see photos). Supposed to be the 2nd largest tree along the trail. I estimate it to be about 15-feet in diameter at breast height (DBH). Pecan on our farm is 18.5 feet at DBH.Good Karma at Ten Mile. Trail Angel John was there with cold beer. Yeah! Then the bad karma hit. I had left my hammock straps back at last nights shelter(TPH).

Lots of PUUDS - perfectly useless ups and downs. Got to shelter ar 1400. Beat down but happy. Plenty of time to chill and get stuff straighten out for a change.Picking up package in Kent, CT early tomorrow morning and doing laundry.

Yes they make noise even if no one is around!Got into Salisbury at 1000. A little shopping for odds and ends, lunch at deli, and the bank. Went to Maria Macabe's at 1230. Already there for 2nd night are Sprout, Bubbles, and Wiskers. Great afternoon talking with Maria and this crew. Better after shower and shave. Went with Bubbles to do mine and some of Maria's laundry. Got 2 large pizzas and had dinner under the trees in backyard
Highlight of afternoon - Maria has a chipmunk that comes and eats from her hand. Bubbles got to do same. Video taken of both.
Evening to rest in bed, charge stuff and get a good rest before tackling Bear Mtn, CT tomorrow. Hoping for no rain after thunderstorm and hail at 1800 today.

Wiskers, Bubbles, and Sprout caught me just before Lion's Head vista. Pics taken. Geology lesson given on nice red, pyrope garnets in the schist outcrops. Could not break one free. Rock tower on top of Bear Mtn was windy, cold and drizzling.
Decided to sack in at Sages Ravine as it looked like bad storms again. Staying dry tonight.Met caretaker and trail crew of 3 heading back up Bear Mtn to check trail.
Set hammock in sprinkle at 1400. Long afternoon and evening doing nothing but resting.
Temp at bedtime was 57 and dropping. Wind was building to gale levels. Trees swaying and cracking. Cool night. Moved down under quilt outside hammock at 2100. More comfortable in that location. Heat staying inside.","Salisbury, CT, Maria's House

Mt Race crest reached at 0830. Not bad climbing for 2 miles in 2 hours for old dawg. Especially since the last 1/2 mile is walking a razor edge of rock on eastern side, with 200 foot cliff within a foot to 3 feet from the edge at times. Winds still blowing like a banshee. Moved down to valley and began ascent of Mt Everett. Met Paul and Tom, brothers, out for a 3 day hike. Turns out Tom is a geologist like me. Similar backgrounds. So now we start the geology discussion about this part of the trail and compare life experiences. Caught up with Paul at crest of Mt Everett. Took some pics an exchanged email stuff.Descent through steep rock cliffs and piles was not fun. After this 4th rough descent of bad rock slopes, I'm beat down.Moved on down to The Hemlocks shelter for ""brunch"". Decided to call this the end for now.

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537568,"After much thought yesterday afternoon, I decided it was time to call off this trip. Sometimes listening to your heart is better than listening to your head. I was not fully prepared mentally to deal with the rugged terrain in these New England mountains. These are much different than the southern trail mountains. Much more rock and the descents are inherently more dangerous such than I am not willing to continue pushing forward at risk of limb and/or life. After several slips and falls that could have had serious consequences, I need to re-evaluate my goals for the AT. There was not much ""fun"" in this trip. Just hard and ""careful"" work to safely navigate the ""matrix"". Once every step has to be carefully evaluated on descents, a better perspective of goals becomes clearer.Despite the back surgery in Jan this year and popping a lower joint in my back out of place on Day 2, I had little pain in my back. I suffered no blisters, but the soles of my feet became extremely sore. The Oboz shoes held up well, but I think they may not have been the best choice for the amount of rock travel experienced here. Re-thinking now, I probably should have gone with the Bean leather hiking boots in my closet. TOO LATE on that thought. 
So the plan is go home, rest, prepare for birth of our first grandchild at end of July and then look forward to working on sections of AT in northern VA, MD, and, PA. Maybe in Sept I'll be ready for another shot at some other ""hills"".
Thanks to all who followed my travels and all the encouragement given to me.

Notably, Little Rocky Row, Big Rocky Row, and Bluff Mtn. Slow and steady on old,out-of-shape legs and lungs. As usual for me, leg cramps were the order for the day.
Beautiful weather for the day but hotter than I needed - mid-70's. I only had 2 qts of water to make it to Punchbowl and there was none in between the 2 shelter sites. Met no one else all day. But I did stir up a Ruffed Grouse on Bluff Mtn near the crest. Nothing like a grouse taking off near your feet to get your heart racing.","Johns Hollow Shelter

However, between the sweating, mist, clouds, and fog in the heights I was soaking wet by quitting time. Passed a few SOBOs today. Beautiful hiking around the edges of the Lynchburg reservoir- lots of contouring.
Arrived along Brown Mtn Creek and traced upstream to the shelter. Was beginning to wear out by the time I arrived. A few more days until I can walk like I've actually been training for this - Ha!
Spent the night in the shelter with one other SOBO. Biggest thunderstorm I've seen this year hits at 2000. Poured all night off and on. Brown Mtn Creek goes from a wimper to roaring by midnight. Tomorrow will be a wet day.","Punchbowl Shelter

Climbing was not as hard as I expected but was covered in sweat by 1000, plus fog and mists of the mountains. No views today, just do the ups and downs. Skipped Cow Camp Shelter as I did not want to do a 1 mile round trip down and back off trail. Trail magic of bottled water at Hog Camp Gap. Took a pint to get me to Seely. Left this gap at 1400 to finish the last 7.7 miles to Seely. A few apples found past Hog Camp Gap but most trees were barren. Some good trails over the last few ridges and gaps. Dropped into Seely at 1800 to find Craig from JMU already in and resting. Others came and went but the next set of storms arrived around 1930-2000 and did not leave until the morning of Oct 1.Worn out but happy to be in the shelter. One set of dry clothes was a blessing.

No phone signals on this section, even on top of The Priest.Bumped along making good time along many contouring trail sections. Passed old road to Fish Hatchery and decided I did not want to skip The Priest and have to come back up to do it later. Passed about 5 or 6 SOBOs, 2 of whom said they passed a bear on the trail a ""ways back"". Should have asked what that meant specifically, as in 15 minutes, 1 mile, around the next corner, etc. As it happened I did not see one. Guess they scared Yogi into the mountains. Got over the Priest at 1215 and headed down one of the more treacherous sections I've seen in a while - as in steep and full of rocks. 1300 - Reached a viewing outcrop about a mile and a half down from the crest. Finally got a signal and called home to request info about Hurricane Matthew. Wife and I decided I should go for Waynesboro on Sunday to meet my mail drop. Made reservations at Montebello Camping Resort for the night. Headed down and ran into several small groups of ""students"" dragging miscellaneous gear to the ""campground"" on top????? No such place on The Priest that I saw. Someone might need to go find them Sunday morning because they were ""helter-skelter"" as far as being experienced hikers, i.e., NOT!Made Tye River crossing and VA Hwy 56 at 1500. Hitching was sketchy for a while. 1545 VA Game Warden pulls over and I think I'm headed to the room with bars for hitching. Too my surprise he offers ride and says they pick up hikers whenever they find them vs letting them hike the road. Since my math on reading the distance to Montebello was off by 6 MILES - I was saved the embarassment of ignorance on map reading. However, the AT Guide needs a serious re-write to clarify distances from the At crossing at this location.Home at last in Montebello at 1600. Showers, clothes washing, dry, peaceful dinner.

As it turns out, Hurricane Matthew did not turn out into the Atlantic as predicted, but hugged the coasts of GA, SC, and NC. At 0200 on Oct 8th, the western edge of the eye wall was brushing Tybee Island, GA and Hilton Head Island, SC. We had evacuated to my mother's farm, about 50 miles from the coast Friday morning Oct 7th. We had somewhere between 10 and 12 inches of rain after 1700 hours until 0500 next morning with winds around 50 to 60 mph. Thankfully there was no damage to any of our homes or farm structures ( in Beaufort, SC, Rincon, GA, and the farm). However, we did not escape wind damage to the timber on the farm. We probably have 15 to 25 loads of large pine ( 20 to 28 inch diameter, 120 feet tall) and really large hardwood on the ground like Pick- Up - Sticks. Too much rain followed by the wind, just laid them down. Now comes attempt to salvage what can be saved. Hopefully, no more rain for a few weeks so the ""world"" down here can dry out.","home
