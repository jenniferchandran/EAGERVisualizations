ChrisMek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517568,"I'm not one for keeping a journal, but what the heck, I'll give this a go I suppose. My decision to Thru-Hike the AT came to me a long time ago. When I found out there was a hiking trail that was continuous from Georgia to Maine, I knew that I wanted to hike the whole length. I always thought I would have time and now that I am in my mid-40's, married with two teenage kids, who knows if I will ever have the opportunity to actually do it. I still plan on it though!So comes my decision to begin section hiking it. There seems no other way for me to hike the whole trail, aside from being retired or getting fired from my job!So... Where to begin section hiking? I figure, since I live about a mile and a half from the AT where it crosses the road in NJ after Waywayanda State Park, about 2.5 miles from the state line with NY, I should hike all of NJ first. It's 72 miles and I live so close to one end, I could either start at the NY/NJ State line and go to PA or Vice Versa. I am leaning toward starting in PA and coming north, just because I think it would be easier to have my wife drop me off on the PA/NJ Border and I would just hike home from there.Now, to start gathering gear. I already have access to an MSR Pocket Rocket or a Whisperlite stove. So check that off the list.Things I will need: • Hiking shoes • Tent • Sleeping bag • A better Pack than I have (maybe) • Cooking gearCrap! As I write this list, I realize I don't have ANYTHING! Except a P.O.S. backpack and a stove. I guess I have a lot to consider. Maybe I don't need too much stuff to start a small section like NJ. I am off next week, so I think I may take a ride to REI and just do some browsing. It's exciting to look at gear!",,Pre-Prep (If that makes any sense),"Nov 19, Thu",0
ChrisMek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517672,"So today I visited REI. I'm on vacation so I decided to stop there and just nose around the store and get an idea of what stuff costs. I looked at sleeping bags, tents, backpacks, shoes and I also looked at stoves and cooking gear. And holy cow! Im more confused now than I ever was, at least in the way of backpacks tents and sleeping bags, mostly backpack though.I'm thinking a pair of Merrell. I like the idea of the high ankles for the support. I wear New Balance sneakers as everyday shoes and have been for a long time. They are always comfortable out of the box and I have never gotten any blisters wearing them. I thought maybe REI had some New Balance but didn't see any. They have Solomon which are lighter, but I don't feel like I can get the same support as with The Merrell boots... I think I will likely get me a pair of Merrell.I looked at the tents, they have this pretty cool tent with lighting built right into it made by Big Agnes. Pretty cool idea, but just something else to break. When it comes to tents, I like the Big Agnes Copper Spur UL2. I like the idea of a 2 person tent. I think the extra room would make it a whole lot more comfortable. I'm 6' 2"" tall and not he slimmest of people either! So if I go tent, that's on the top of the list. I looked at hammocks too, or at least tries to, they don't really have a way of really checking them out. The other assistant Scoutmaster in the troop we are in stays in a hammock whenever we go camping. He swears by it but I'm not too sure I can do it, I toss and turn a lot while I sleep. I switch from laying on my back to my side to my stomach and so on. Something to consider T least.I got in front of the sleeping bag display and was overwhelmed, i didn't look at anything in depth enough to develop any kind of opinion. So I need to make anoth trip to REI!!I do t know what to look for in a backpack. I assume the size of the pack is an important factor. I would assume that a big pack would be better for longer trips. I tried on a couple different Osprey brand packs but need to spend more time there and ask a lot of questions. I really liked the way the Osprey Atmos 50 AG felt on my back, but, is it big to carry everything I need? Need to spend more time researching. While I was there I looked at the stoves. My scouts have an MSR pocket rocket. That's what I will use. While I was in that area, I looked at the dehydrated foods. They look really great, but they are really expensive, AND they are all like 2 servings so more than I need. But for a week long trip, maybe they will work. I may start stocking up on these. Seems like the easy way to eat. Well there you go. Nothing purchased but I am a little more educated!",,REI Visit,"Nov 23, Mon",0
ChrisMek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517713,"I was out running errands today. I went to the Barnes & Noble looking for some books about planning an AT trek. There were none. They had a couple about the history of the trail but that really wasn't what I was looking for. The B&N I was at was really close to the Campmor store so I stopped in to nose around a bit. I spent some time talking to some scout parents. They were buying a Pocket Rocket for their son. Campmor hasa a huge selection of trail food and the prices are pretty good. I think that's where I will be getting my food for my NJ AT trip. Looking at packs, I stumbled across the Osprey Aether 70. I think the size may be more than I need for a 4-5 day trip but in the long run, it will get good use. So I'm thinking that is the size I will go for.That's about all I looked at today. But I just realized how cool it is to live so close to Campmor! Happy Thanksgiving everyone!",,Campmor Visit,"Nov 25, Wed",0
ChrisMek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517717,So today I got my A.T. Guide that I forgot I ordered from Amazon... Some really great info in it! I really wish I was headed to Springer Mountain next year!,,A.T. Guide,"Nov 25, Wed",0
ChrisMek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517866,"I was volunteering at the church with my scouts the other day. I mentioned to the other Assistant Scoutmaster, Peter, that I am planning to hike thru NJ on the AT and asked him if he was interested. I asked him if he was interested in doing it with me. He just kind of shook is head a little and said ""Hmmm."" I figured that was the end of that and he didn't really want to, then the next day i got a whole lot of questions about doing it. Long story short, if our schedules can line up, we will be doing this trip together!That's exciting for me. I really wanted to do this with someone else, just because sometimes I like to bounce ideas off someone else. I like Peter. We get along together well. We are about the same age and are both about the same with regards to how in shape we are, or rather, Out of shape!! It will be fun to egg each other about how we are preparing for the trek!I am getting more excited each day!",,Partner?,"Nov 30, Mon",0
ChrisMek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518242,"Going back a few years, I used to have an online radio show. I did it for a friend. He had a website (tonytradio.com) that he used as an excuse to get bands to come play in his studio. It was a lot of fun and I got to meet a lot of great musicians. I needed a name for my show and just went with ChrisMek Radio. So for now, I think I am just going to go with ChrisMek. I've been known as ChrisMek by so many people, for so many other reason, for so long, it just makes sense for me. Unless someone comes up with something else, that's what I am going with. In other news: I ordered the Appalachian Trail Thru-Hike Planner. I got it for the fun of it. I know it will be years and years before I will actually do a Thru-Hike. It's nice to dream. In terms off my NJ Thru hike, Peter is 100% on board. He is as excited as I am. He popped in at my daughter's sweet 16 party with a friend to pick up his son. We got talking to his friend Sean and we may have a third person! Sean's concern seemed to be: ""How will we carry all our Beer?"" I wonder if that will be the deciding factor on whether he comes or not. Anyway, Christmas is coming so we'll see if I can somehow manage to convince people that I need backpacking gear!",,Trail Name,"Dec 09, Wed",0
ChrisMek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518462,"I've been reading a lot of Journals and watching a lot of YouTube videos about hiking the A.T. Just about everyone lists the reason they are hiking the trail. I said in a previous journal entry that I wanted to do it when I found out that there was a trail that was 2200 miles long. I knew then that I wanted do it. Does that answer the question of “Why?” Not really sure, but it got me thinking about why I like to hike in general and what I expect when I do get out there and hike and then eventually get around to a thru hike.So when I hike with my scouts, we are working on rank advancements and scout requirements so I don’t get to enjoy the hikes the way I do when I hike alone. What I really enjoy when I hike for my own pleasure is the quiet solitude being out in the woods. I enjoy stopping and admiring the views and I really enjoy seeing the wildlife. I’ve always considered myself a bit of a loner. I just really enjoy my alone time. I’m not saying I don’t enjoy some company at times; it’s just that I like to be alone with my thoughts often.In terms of some day thru hiking the AT: I think that I just like the idea of the challenge of doing it. The thought of living as a minimalist for 6 months appeals to me in some strange way. I don’t really have any other reason besides that I want to do it for myself. I don’t think my wife thinks I am serious about it. I’ve mentioned to her in the past that I want to do some serious backpacking. Of course there was always a reason that I couldn’t do it so never did. This summer I am doing some!Now I know that doing a NOBO Thru Hike starting in the Spring time is popular and attracts crowds and whenever I get around to an A.T. thru hike that is what I’ve always thought I would do. The crowds stress me a little. I assume that the crowds disperse the farther north you go. But while watching the YouTube videos, I came across this one particular older guy whose videos pretty much were all interviewing the hikers by just asking them all what their trailnames are. It seemed to me that they were always partying. Every once in a while he would talk about a “Safety Meeting”. Now, I’m not so innocent that I don’t understand what he was talking about. There are all sorts of codes for smoking pot. I’m not against smoking weed or partying at all. But I hope someone can please tell me that the A.T. isn’t 2200 miles of pot smoking and partying the whole way. Anyone have some insight on this? I just feel like this guy’s video is leaving a bad impression on me. Every shelter seemed like a bunch pot smokers and partyers. Is it going to be a loud party at every shelter all night long? Probably not but this still stresses me out. On to another topic:I am an Amateur Radio Operator, or Ham Radio Operator. I’ve brought a small portable radio on campouts with me. I wonder if would enjoy operating my radio after hiking all day and would the extra weight be worth it. The radio I would think to get weighs about 2.2 lbs. That’s not including the antenna that I would have to pack too. I figure a wire antenna wouldn’t really weight that much, an additional pound, maybe. But in the grand scheme, an extra 3.2 pounds makes a huge difference! Maybe the big radio is just a bit too much, I have a small “Walkie-Talkie” Style radio that would do just fine for what I am thinking. I just recently got to thinking that I need to start setting aside some money for hiking gear if I am going to section hike NJ this summer. Most importantly right now is footwear. I have two pairs of worn out hiking boots that both leak through the soles and don’t keep my feet dry. I think that is a priority. I can get by with the pack I have. I will need a tent and probably a sleeping bag to. I have a sleeping bag, but it is way too heavy for a backpacking trip. In a pinch, I have something I can use though it’s not very comfortable. But I really need to figure out what to do about a tent. I don’t plan on lugging my 4-person Coleman with me.",,AT = PartyTime?,"Dec 17, Thu",0
ChrisMek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519052,"I had some time off from December 23 through January 3. I didn’t do a whole lot of anything, but I was able to get a cooking pot. I was wandering around Walmart doing some Christmas shopping and as usual ended up in the hiking/camping/hunting/fishing department. I came across a “Stanley Adventure Series Camp Cook Set” which is a 24 ounce stainless steel pot with a lid and two 10 ounce plastic cups. I figured this would be a good pot to use for a backpacking trip so I tossed it into the cart and gave it to myself for Christmas and it was only about $15! While I was at it, I grabbed a plastic fork, knife and spoon. These were only 57 cents each. My only concern with them is that I hope they don’t melt.I also got some cash for Christmas. One of my biggest concerns taking a multi-day backpacking trip is wearing good hiking shoes. I figure I could probably go on the cheap with some of the other gear, but I want decent hiking shoes. So I think with my Christmas cash, I will be picking up some good shoes. There is a Sports Authority next to the Walmart so I browsed around there looking at hiking boots. They have a decent selection, but I don’t know what makes one boot better than the other. I think I know what I want in a hiking boot, I want some ankle support, I want them to be waterproof, I want them to be comfortable and most of all, I don’t them to give me blisters. I think that proper breaking in will help that. They carry a wide variety and just like all the other things that I research; I get overwhelmed with making the decision. I like the Merrell Energis, The North Face Storm and the Columbia Redmond. They are all between $100 and $110. I noticed that Hi-Tec makes a few boots that look similar to the three I listed for about half the price. Why so much cheaper? I guess in the end, I need to try on all these and make a decision. Whichever one fits and feels the best, that’s what I will get.I also got a GoPro Hero Camera for Christmas. It’s the entry level camera but it’s really cool! When I opened it, my first thought was “I am going to bring this on my backpacking trip!” It only comes with 2 stick on mounts so I wasn’t sure how I was going to use it while hiking. While I was nosing around at Sports Authority, I found a bicycle handle bar mount and bought it to mount on my shotgun, (which really worked out great on a pheasant hunt)… So on another Walmart trip, I picked up a cheap set of trekking poles. I don’t see how more expensive trekking poles make that much of a difference so I grabbed them for trekking and also to mount my GoPro onto, which should work out great! I figure I usually don’t hike with trekking poles, so $20 isn’t that much to spend to mount my camera to and if I decide that I should use them as trekking poles, I have them.At the family Christmas party, I was talking to my wife’s cousin about backpacking. Turns out, a few years ago he hiked from the Delaware Water Gap to Waywayanda State Park, which is opposite of what we are planning to do. Anyway, he offered to let me borrow some of his gear. I will definitely be asking to borrow his tent and maybe his water filter too.I was fooling around on the internet and found videos of people making alcohol stoves using soda cans. Of course, I had to try it. I went and put together a couple stoves and tried them out. I was able to boil a cup of water, in just under 4 minutes, using the Stanley cook pot. It definitely needs a pot stand for it to work properly. I don’t think I will be using this as my primary stove, but with how lightweight it is, I may bring it just for kicks. I will be using an MSR stove.Now that the holidays are behind me, I am already anxious to get planning. I know it’s only a week long trip, but I’m super stoked. I’ve been wanting to do a multiple day backpacking trip for a really long time. I just hope that Peter’s schedule lines up with mine and we are able to do this together.I think next for me is to get boots, socks, rain gear, and clothes; then start planning food. Will I buy all dehydrated food? dehydrate my own stuff? How many times will I be eating out?Getting Psyched!",,Over the holidays,"Jan 04, Mon",0
ChrisMek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520546,"So Peter and I finally got together and compared our calendars. We were both expecting to do this some time in the summer. May, June, July and August didn't work out. I thought, why not April? Peter wasn't too excited about it. So, September 9 through 14 is what we chose. That's 6 days to cover 72 miles. Average of 12 mile per day. If we need more time, I know that I can take a couple extra days off without any trouble, just not sure about him.I have acquired a backpack. And by acquired, I mean someone gave it to me. It's brand new, never been used. It's a Boy Scout Pack. Officially, its is a ""BSA Technical Venturing 50L Backpack"". It's a pretty decent pack. It's got lots of adjustment so that as a scout grows, you can adjust it to fit his size. So being 6'2"" tall, the first this I did was adjust it to the ""Tall Guy"" size and it seems to fit really well. It's got all the standard bells and whistles you could ask for in a pack. And when I say whistle, I mean it. There is a whistle built into the chest strap. Pretty cool. It didn't come with a bladder so i picked one up and it fit perfectly where it is supposed to go. I still haven't gotten my boots. I just haven't had the chance yet. Got a little insight on my guest book regarding waterproof boots. (Thanks Mustang!) The thought being waterproof boots are meant to keep water out. But if water gets IN, it works the same in reverse, they keep water IN. I understand this. And being I am not thru hiking with these boots, I will likely just go ahead with waterproof. My plan is to Day hike with these before and after my NJ section hike. When I finally do a thru hike, I will likely go lighter weight. So for out NJ section hike, we have decided to start at the NY/NJ State line and go south to Delaware Water Gap. Peter wanted to start at my house near Waywayanda State Park, but I want to do the entire 72 mile length. So there we go! I just wish I could be on a flight or train to Georgia! My time will eventually come.Just to get a gear list in writing. This is what I still need to get, off the top of my head:Rain GearBootsSocksFirst Aid KitPermethrinAnti-Chafe stuffHeadlampSleeping bagPara-cordwater filter (Borrowing)Tent (Borrowing)Aquamira New Nalgene water bottleSo I think that's about it. This of course doesn't include food.Anything else anyone can suggest for a multi-day section hike, I am open to suggestions.",,Date Set!,"Feb 01, Mon",0
ChrisMek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522162,"I stopped at Sports Authority to get boots last week and left empty handed. They had a pair of Merells I liked but they didn't have my size. There was another pair that I did try on but they were too tight. So today after work I went to Campmor and picked up a pair of Keen Durand. They are pretty comfortable out of the box but after wearing them around the house for an hour, they definitely need some breaking in. I also grabbed a pair of Darn Tough socks. I got a message from Peter with a link to ""just add water"" recipes. This tells me that he is prepping! Or at least thinking about it! So I wonder if I should just get mountain house meals or make our own as he seems to be suggesting. For a week I think buying would be fine, but it would be cool to make them myself. I may try both!So Ive also been thinking g about other hikers. Being that I live close to the trail, I would love to be able to help out some thru hikers once they get to my area of NJ. But how do I know when they will be passing through? I figure that by NJ the crowds have thinned out considerably and they are spaced out a lot more, so setting up trail magic on a random day doesn't seem like it would get a lot of action. I would be willing to give rides for resupply or to REI or Campmor or something along those lines, as long as I'm not at work or out of town. So I guess get in touch with me and let me know when you will be around the Waywayanda area and tell me how I might be able to help you out. We'll see what we can work out.",,Boots & Pants & Boots & Pants ...,"Feb 29, Mon",0
ChrisMek,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546828,"My section hike of NJ starts on September 9 at the Stateline trail by Greenwood Lake Marina a short distance up to the AT at the NY/NJ stateline and ending at the Delaware Water Gap. A Total of about 73 mile.I have just about everything I need. I still need to buy food. That's the easy stuff. I need to make a trip to Campmor. I want to grab a pair of convertible pants and shirt that isn't cotton. A few other things I am thinking of grabbing is some first aid stuff. Neo-Sporin-I'm not sure if that's something to bring or not. I would think its part of a standard first aid kit. And maybe benedryl and antacid too. Besides that, I think I am good to go!Can't wait!",,2 Weeks out!,"Aug 25, Thu",0
