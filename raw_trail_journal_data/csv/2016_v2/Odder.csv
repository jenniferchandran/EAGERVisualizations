Odder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542307,"Stayed at the AT Hiker Hostel with Mark and Tina Hopper in Monson last night. Got a shuttle to the half way point of the 100 mile wilderness. Heading north to Mount Katahdin in Baxter State Park. Hiked a relatively flat 10 miles to a campsite a few hundred yards off the trail. Mark was setting up his tent when he realized he had no poles. He managed to set it up, sort of, by tying ropes to strategic points. Shortly after this creative endeavor the poles were found lying on the ground nearby. Go figure.","Jo Mary Road - Cooper Brook

Soaked up some solar energy and enjoyed the view. Hiked to the peak of Carter Dome then descended Carter Notch and stopped in at the Hut. Scored some cold pancakes and oatmeal. A steep climb out of the notch brought me to the peak of Wildcat Mountain. Followed the ridgeline to the top of the Wildcat ski area. The gondola was running and I spent 10 minutes debating on taking the gondola to the bottom or hiking down Pinkham Notch. I decided to hike. It is a 2000 ft elevation drop over a relatively short distance. I got to the point where the trail seemed to go over a cliff, with a very iffy route down. I tossed my poles to the bottom of the 25 ft. drop and began to descend. I got about 5 ft. down when my spider senses told me that this could not possibly be the trail. I was able to climb back up and then noticed a small ledge at the top of the cliff. I followed this ledge to a much safer route down. (A well placed white blaze would have saved me a lot of anguish!!) Now to rescue my poles, which I was able to do successfully. A lot more down, followed by a one mile hike parallel to Highway 16 brought me to the Pinkham Notch Visitors Centre. I had insufficient cell signal so I could not call for a shuttle back to Gorham.

Odder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552455,"Started hiking around 8:00 a.m. This section of the trail was previously closed due to forest fires. Much of the trail ran through burned forest today. At one point I saw where a fire break had been cut through the bush. One side was burned and the other not, so it appeared that the break did its job. Not as many fallen trees blocked the trail today so the hiking speed was not impacted like yesterday. The fire must have been very intense at the top of Wayah Bald. The roof of the stone observation tower was completely burned away and the interpretive signs were melted. Night hiked the last 2 hours and finished at 7:45 p.m. The trail south of here is still closed up to Dick's Creek Gap. Tomorrow I will head back to Fontana Dam and head NOBO through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. I will jump ahead to Dick's Creek Gap when I finish the Smokies.","Tellico Gap

Odder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552456,I decided to hike the Smokies northbound since I was already south of the park. After slack packing for more than three weeks my pack is fully loaded. Back to sleeping in shelters for a few nights. Started walking across the Fontana Dam at 8:30 a.m. 3000 ft. of elevation gain today with a full pack meant a little more work than I was used to. Foggy and drizzly so no views and no pictures. Stopped for a snack at the Shuckstack tower but didn't go up. Met Zappy Tendrils there. Cool to meet another SOBO whose name I had seen the shelter registers so many times. Also crossed paths with Sleeping Beauty today. Arrived at the shelter after dark and shared it with 3 weekend hikers from Florida.,"Fontana Dam

Odder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552457,"Waited for the rain to slow down this morning, so I got a late start going NOBO again. Discovered a group of 5 wild turkey toms on the summit of Rocky Top. They let me get very close. Crossed paths with Pancake, Journey and Duke (Captain Cook), some of my SOBO friends. Rain and fog so no views today. Shared the shelter with Nine Bears and Add Coffee, 2 more SOBOs. A bit of a southbound bubble coming through as the Great Smoky Mountains National Park had very recently reopened after being closed due to forest fire.","Spence Field Shelter

Odder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552458,Headed NOBO again. Rain and ice slowed me down today. Lots of fog gave very limited visibility. Climbed the ramp to the top of the tower on Clingman's summit and got a great view of fog and raindrops. The trail was very icy near the summit. Met Agent and Shakespeare as they were hiking south. They will finish a few days after me. It was good to see them one more time before we finish. Arrived at Newfound Gap at 4:00 p.m. I was supposed to meet Sheryl for lunch there and continue another 10 miles. Instead of hiking further I rode back to the motel. I was able to dry out my gear and fill my belly with a 12 inch sub from Subway.,"Double Spring Gap

Odder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552459,"Watched the sun rise with my wife at Newfound Gap. The trees were coated with frost/ice. On the trail going NOBO by 7:45 a.m. Someone had decorated part of the trail for Christmas. That was kind of strange. Saw what I think was a peregrine falcon at Charlie's Bunion. I was above the clouds all day making for some mystical views. Much of the trail was along ridge tops with steep slopes on either side. The forecast was for a very cold night. I had intended to stay at Cosby Knob shelter but decided to push through the dark to cover the extra 10 miles to the road where I could get picked up. I met Sheryl at the car at 1:00 am. after hiking 32 miles. My longest distance in one day. Had a warm, comfortable sleep at Travelowe's Motel in Maggie Valley North Carolina.","Newfound Gap

Odder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552599,"Slept in after the 32 mile hike yesterday. Left the Travelowes motel at 11:00 a.m. and drove to Neels Gap. Entered the final state, Georgia. Almost done. Found a section that was the right length for the amount of time available to hike and went NOBO today. The hike is much more flexible when you have a car and driver available. Stayed at the Budget Inn in Hiawassee and had AYCE supper at Daniel's Steakhouse.","Neels Gap

Odder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552601,First full day in Georgia. Headed NOBO today. Trail was relatively flat and smooth. Didn't see any other hikers. Will likely see more on the weekend (Friday today). Made good time arriving 1/2 hour earlier than expected. I had to wait in the Dick's Creek Gap parking lot for 15 minutes for Sheryl to show up with the car.,"Unicoa Gap

Odder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552602,Too wet to take pictures today. Made great time in the rain and had less distance to cover since I hiked the next 6.9 mile section (Hogpen Gap to Neels Gap) two days ago. Crossed paths with 7 weekend hikers and 3 dogs. Finished at 2:45 pm. and headed to the Hiker Hostel. A hot shower felt good after being cold and wet on the trail.,"Unicoa Gap

Odder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552603,"Got an early start. Was on trail just after first light. Headed NOBO today. Took a break from the drizzle at Gooch Mountain Shelter. Half Fool showed up and we had a good chat as we ate some snacks. He will finish the trail today and get picked up by family at Amicalola Falls State Park tomorrow. Pushed on through the fog and rain. Summited Blood Mountain and checked out the Blood Mountain Shelter. Sure didn't look like a comfortable place to stay. A lot of rain had blown in through the window and door openings onto the uneven concrete floor. My only views of the day were here, I could see only the tops of the clouds and the very tips of the mountains. Arrived at Neels Gap before dark","Cooper Gap

Odder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552604,"Had breakfast at the Hiker Hostel, then headed out for my last day on the trail. Met numerous day hikers. Trail was well worn with lots of campsites. I tried to imagine the Northbound bubble of thru-hiker wannabes that will be on this part of the trail in 3 short months. I was stopped by a former thru-hiker and congratulated on finishing. He had been talking to Sheryl (my wife) earlier at the Springer Mountain parking lot. I met up with Sheryl at 4:00 pm and we hiked the last mile, to the peak of Springer Mountain together. I posed for some pictures and then we headed back down the trail to the car. The hike is now complete. Time to head home.","Cooper Gap
