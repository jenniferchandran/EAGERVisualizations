Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505528,"One of my favorite locations just off the AT in the Great Smoky Mtns. - Mt. Cammerer fire tower.   Built by the CCC back in 1937. They built things to last in those days! The work crew used nearby rock and timber for materials. In a really rugged setting. Path to it is strewn with boulders. The fire tower was manned until the mid-1960s, then abandoned. Refurbished in 1996. Bit of a walk thru time to come upon it. Have been there twice. Hope to get there again during the last week of my month-long trek on the AT. After bidding adieu to my daughter Becca and nephew Ben at end of week 3, willswing down to Great Smoky Mtns Nat'l Park. Want to do the whole stretch of the AT along the spine of those Mtns.",,Mt. Cammerer,"Jul 15, Wed",0
Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505550,"Thought I'd introduce my hiking partners - my youngest daughter and my nephew, Becca and Ben.   Long time buddies themselves! Will be spending the better part of a week with them on AT. Of course, they won't look quite so well groomed. And they'll look a bit older. Both are kicking age 30 in the butt this year. Should be a fun outing with them!",,Hiking Partners,"Jul 15, Wed",0
Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/506334,"Life at Calf Mtn hut. Got there about 2:30 pm after starting at Waynesboro. Two women thru-hikers already there, Lil Bean (pictured) and Gaget Girl. Get used to it, everyone uses a trail name in lieu of their real one on the AT. 
Anyway, Lil Bean and Gaget Girl had started out at Springer Mtn, GA, in mid-April. Planning to flip at Harpers Ferry. Will get off trail and travel to Kathadin in Maine, then finish in Maryland. Avoid the colder and more variable Fall weather in northeast that way.The young man pictured (aka Native) humbled us all. He started at Springer in mid-May after finishing his CPA exam. That means he covered almost 1,000 miles in just over 60 days. He was planning a 26 mile hike the next day (ouch!). Great stories from them all about life on the trail.Got to go. Am covering 13 miles today myself. Just stopped for break and had 2 bars on my phone!","Hiking Partners

Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/506737,"Got a nice early start on the trail Monday morning. The only one to beat me out of camp was Native. He spoke of hiking 26 miles today. The two young hikers who blew into camp late Sunday (Wheels and Unusual) were still asleep as I left. Gadget Girl felt ill, delaying her start with Lil' Bean. Quiet forest as I hiked along - punctuated at intervals by one beautiful songbird. I had no idea of the variety, but who cares? Sun rays penetrated at odd angles thru the trees. Almost surreal image of trail and surroundings as result. Had the trail to myself for a few hours.Had to hike a full 13 miles to the next shelter, Blackrock Hut. No water source along the way, so I had to carry a full supply, plus a little extra. You see, it was supposed to be another hot one with high humidity. Same as Sunday when I started. The humidity made the air thick. The photo was taken by day hiker in late morning. My clothes were already soaked thru with sweat. And I mean soaked! Glad I brought electrolyte tablets. Also glad that all section and thru hikers stink - because I sure did. But that is part of the experience!Got to Blackrock Hut in late afternoon after arduous climb. Did I mention that Blackrock Hut is a half mile shy of the Blackrock Mtn summit? Steep climb. Had the hut to myself until almost 8:00 in the evening. Then Lil' Bean and the 2 young guys, Wheels and Unusual blew in. Put on headlamps and made their dinners after setting up their own tents. I preferred the shelter (hut), even though a previous hiker had found a copperhead around his shoes in the shelter just a couple of weeks before. No one since had complained of that in the hut's log book.....","Call of the Trail
",Blackrock Hut,"Jul 20, Mon",13
Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507048,"Started out early from Blackrock Hut with Lil' Bean, a thru-hiker. Trail north from this hut goes straight up steeply to summit of Blackrock Mtn. Lil' Bean is a full head shorter than me, and a woman and carrying a pack weighing as much as mine. I figured this would be a good test of my hiking abilities. She'd been out on the AT going north since mid-April.At the main trail I bent over to tighten my shoelaces. When I looked up again Lil' Bean was gone. And I mean gone! Figured I'd catch up with her, or at least catch sight of her. The trail up to Blackrock summit goes straight up - no switchbacks. Wrong! A humbling experience as I chugged along the trail.Blackrock summit was awesome! Rocky crest and 270 degree view. Hard to capture that in a photo. And I can only post one photo per journal entry, so I posted one from another overlook.Was headed to Loft Mtn Campground and wayside (read - short order grill) for lunch. The trail along the way got fairly overgrown in parts. The trail maintenance workers hadn't been there in a while. I came upon a plump deer munching the foliage. Darn thing didn't move as I approached. Got within 10 feet of the deer and it finally stepped off the trail - just barely. Then it stared at me as I went past it. Seems deer in this nat'l park are pretty tame. We'll see about the bears.Came to The edge of Loft Mtn Campground and there sat Lil' Bean taking a break at an overlook. While we were chatting, another woman backpacker came up the trail. She started to choke, then cry and feel to the ground sobbing. Of course we went to assist.Seems this other young woman (whom I won't name) had been stung by a wasp on the AT near Waynesboro. Went into anaphylactic shock and was rushed to ER. Was her second day on trail after recovering from that ordeal. Going thru the high grass brought on a panic attack - thinking a wasp would attack her. And she was no hiking novice afraid of her shadow - she was a thru-hiker who had started in GA.We talked her thru it and got her calm. Then we all went to the roadside grill for lunch - hamburgers, fries and a blackberry milkshake. The young lady was still nervous about returning to the trail immediately, so Lil' Bean and I talked her into walking a few miles down Skyline Drive to an intersection with the AT.Did you know that the original AT thru Shennandoah Nat'l Pk was expropriated for Skyline Dr? The current AT is an alternate route that was developed. So it wasn't like we really weren't on the AT when walking on the Drive. While we walked along I took the photo pictured. Caption says all.At the intersection of the AT with the drive, the young woman was prepared to carry on. She and Lil' Bean took the lead. They were out of sight shortly and I resumed my solo hike to Pinefield Hut.","Blackrock Hut
",Pinefield Hut,"Jul 21, Tue",13
Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507206,"Last Wednesday, I was heading north on the AT in Shenandoah NP, going downhill just before Powell Gap. Had left Pinefield Hut early that morning. Came upon a small rocky outcrop with fantastic view of hollow and valley beyond. Startled an older bearded guy sitting on the rocks just getting ready to bite off a chew of ""tabbacy.""I apologized for the start, then sat next to him to savor the view and have a trail snack and some water. Nice to get that heavy pack off my back, too. Another hot day on the trail.We exchanged pleasantries. He wore a shirt indicating he was an AT trail maintenance worker. Talked a bit about his work. From his accent, I knew the man was a local.I made mention of the beautiful view of the valley below us. ""Bacon Holler,"" he said while pointing that way. Then he leaned over and said in a gravelly voice, ""Want'a hear a story?""Of course I said yes. He told me the point had been a popular place to camp. He gestured towards some small level clearings on the other side of the trail opposite the rock outcrop. The old man went on to say a couple of years earlier a hiker had come up to this point and found a dead man stretched out on the rock outcrop. The dead man was clutching a flashlight. His eyes and mouth were both still wide open. The corpse had both hands on the flashlight pointing it towards Bacon Holler - uh, Hollow.The spooked hiker had fled back down the trail to find a Ranger. The NP service brought in an expert to investigate (or ""vestigate"" as the old man would say) this strange death.Seems the dead man had been camping at the same point during a moonless night (new moon). He was a young man, age 32, and not from the area. The young man had no history of major medical problems. Yet, the autopsy revealed he had died of a massive heart attack.During questioning, the locals in ""Bacon Holler"" below the rocky point had some interesting observations. Some claimed to have seen a small flashing light up on the point the night of the young man's death. One man, the trail worker's father, claimed the light flashed at different speeds - some short and some long.The ""vestigator,"" said the old man, never could determine what caused the young man's heart attack. So the case was closed.Later that same year, someone secretly came and erected a kind of memorial in the vicinity of the old campsite near that rock outcrop. They cleared an area, then set heavy flat stones on the ground, forming a crude circle. Then they arranged heavy rocks atop the flat stones in the design of a pentacle. The rangers at first wanted to remove the stone design, but were overruled by orders from Washington, DC. No one ever found out who gave the order. The Rangers did, however, let the memorial area overgrow with forest brush.Naive campers who went to that beautiful spot to camp were known to change plans and leave abruptly just as night came. They would scurry down the rugged, rock strewn path using whatever light source they could- often leaving their belongings behind. Those campers would later complain of growling, howling and groaning noises unlike any they'd heard before in the forest. Some complained that their flashlight would start to blink on and off by itself and not stop.The old fellow looked me right in the eye. Then he said the people in ""Bacon Holler"" see a light flashing from that rock outcrop whenever there is a new moon. Happens well after dark. And that started right after the young man's death. No one from Bacon Holler has had the will to go up and investigate during the nighttime when its occurring. As the old man said, ""those happenin's best left 'lone.""There was a pause after he said that to me. Then I boldly asked, ""Is all of that really true, or just a load of bull? I mean, flashing lights from this point every new moon? A pentacle on government land?""The old man turned and spat a large volume of ""tabbacy"" juice on the rocks in front of us.   Then he wiped his chin with his hand, turned back to me and with a stern look on his face said, ""Jez y'all go ask any dem good folks in Bacon Holler - they'll tell ya' true."" He pointed to the few houses far below us.I thanked him for the story, got up, shouldered my heavy backpack and bid him adieu. I had to complete a 12 mile solo trek on the AT that hot summer day. And a lot of it was still in front of me.","Pinefield Hut
",Swift Run Gap,"Jul 22, Wed",12
Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507913,"Stayed the night in small motel near Elkton, VA. Had arranged mail drop of food. Too many deserts in my inventory though. Gave away a few to a local in Elkton. She was thrilled.Paid another local for a ride to the trailhead and started my journey. Not a very long hike today to Bearfence Mtn Hut - only 9 miles. Few water stops were again available along this part of the AT. In fact, my map showed only one - a picnic area just off the trail about 3 miles ahead. It was another hot day, so I planned to carry full water bottles from the picnic area forward. A full load of water combined with all the new food provisions made for a heavy pack. I would notice that load towards the end of my journey.I had a couple of 800 ft climbs along the way to Bearfence Mtn Hut. One would think with all that climbing there would be at least one decent overlook on the AT. There were none to be had. The only benefit of the trail today was that thick canopy of trees overhead. It managed to block out most direct sunlight and make the heat a little more bearable.Don't be fooled by the photo. It was taken yesterday along the AT. I'd run into a small family day hiking to some fine overlooks. The backdrop of the photo was one of them. The dad agreed to snap the photo of me. Can you tell it was hot yesterday too?I arrived at the hut early. Two hikers were just finishing their lunch as I arrived around 1:30 pm. Husband and wife from FL on an extended vacation. Nice people. After they left I was alone with my thoughts. I realized why the thru-hikers put in so many miles every day. Not much to do at a hut or campsite in mid-afternoon - especially when you are alone.But ""alone"" didn't last long. A troop of young adults descended on the hut and campsite. Four guys and one gal arrived about 4:00 pm. Seems they all worked for the same adventure ride company in NC. The outing was part of a self-imposed team bonding exercise. That included sharing the excitement of seeing a copperhead on the trail and getting some ugly blisters. I shared a couple of blister pads with those having the worst ones, along with advice on how to treat them.Later, two more individuals would join us, Woody and Stoner, a father/son duo. The son earned his trail name, Stoner, from his propensity to trip over rocks on the trail. The duo set up hammocks at a nearby tent site. Note that there are typically a few to many tent sites in vicinity of a hut (called ""shelter"" outside the Nat'l Pk).This would be the first time I would share room in the shelter with someone else. All six young adults opted for that accommodation. They were reasonable about their bedtimes. Long miles on the trail with heavy packs will have that effect. Only I snored that night. Didn't bother me since I wore earplugs.","Swift Run Gap
",Bearfence Mtn Hut,"Jul 23, Thu",9
Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508176,"Forgive me for not posting these journal entries earlier. Cell strength in the Nat'l Pk was poor to non-existent. Improved once I'd left the park, but now I'm behind. So, I'm working to catch up!Last Thursday I awakened at Bearfence Hut to the presence of visitors. Three deer were in camp, ostensibly to look for a handout. It was obvious from their behavior that other hikers had offered them food. I hoped that none of those hikers offered the same handout to bears in the area....... Recall there was a large group in our camp. Most of them young adults with little hiking or camping experience. As a couple brandished painful looking blisters to one another, I offered some friendly advice - and a couple of blister pads. It was well received.I was out of camp and on the trail towards Bearfence Mtn summit and scramble. Uphill again. The scramble is about a half mile loop on boulders and rocks around the summit. Offered fine views, but also the possibility of a broken ankle. Not something a solo hiker should risk - so I passed on the loop. I did take a peak at the view (pictured). Note the trail went straight up those boulders (blue blaze trail marker). A little scrambling was required to go on.My destination was Rock Springs Hut, about 11.5 miles hence. While walking thru the morning forest, I again marveled at the lack of bids singing. With no wind, if you stopped hiking the woods were dead still. Robert Service described that stillness as ""a silence you most could hear."" But he was referring to the silence in a wintertime environment.I brought up that issue (no birds) with other hikers along the way or in camp. All acknowledged it was strange upon reflection. All but one could provide no explanation. That will come later.I met three hikers that morning. Two were a British couple doing a thru-hike of the AT. The were heading south having just flip-flopped. They'd started in PA and gone north to Maine, then traveled back to where they'd started and headed south for Springer Mtn in GA. And they were wearing Teva Sandals with no toe covering! Shades of Jesus and Moses on the AT. When they mentioned going south, I mentioned ""The Priest."" I hiked 8 miles in the mountains that morning and early afternoon before arriving at Big Meadows. This is a Nat'l Pk Lodge and campground. It also has a wayside and store a little off the AT. A cheeseburger with all the trimmings and a blackberry milkshake beaconed! As I made my way to the front of the wayside grill, two backpacks were stacked on an outside picnic bench. I knew I'd be welcomed by my fellow travelers to share the table for lunch, so I threw my heavy pack next to them on the bench. Then out of the grill came Woody and his son, Stoner, both of whom had camped at Bearfence Hut the night before. It was a pleasant reunion, with all of us happy to see one another.During our feast at the picnic table I told my compatriots that I needed to go to the main lodge to access their WFi (which didn't work properly!). A couple at a nearby table offered a ride to the lodge and I accepted. Both people seemed very well educated from our conversation in the car. I brought up the lack of birds and singing. The man indicated the Nat'l Pk was a migratory way-station and that accounted for the lack of many birds. He also indicated it was past mating season so the few birds there had no reason to call to attract a mate or defend territory. Sounded plausible to me. Besides, what do I know - I'm a city boy.After my brig visit to the lodge, I hit the trail again. It was 3.5 more arduous miles to the Rock Springs Hut - mostly uphill. When I arrived, there was Woody and Stoner. They'd set up camp within eyeshot of the Hut (or shelter). We were joined by a young college student named Pack Mule.That evening I gave the fellows a stirring rendition of ""The Shooting of Dan McGrew."" None of them had ever heard or read that lengthy poem set in the Yukon gold rush days. I know I did well because I had gone over and over that poem in my head while hiking those long miles. I had needed a break from my other mental repetitions of the song Wagon Wheel by Darius what's-his-name.Not long after that ""hiker midnight"" was upon us - 9:00 pm. That is a standard in the trail. So we all turned in. I was alone in the hut as the others had chosen to tent or hammock camp. In the morning, both Woody and Stoner told me of a frightening story. The previous night both men were awakened by a large bear walking right thru their campsite - right between their two hammocks! Woody said he knew it was a large bear because he could feel the vibrations from each footfall of the bear. I said, ""You mean like in Jurassic Park?"" Woody said, ""Exactly!"" Pack mule had been camped some distance away, but confirmed hearing the bear rummaging around. They all looked at me and asked if I'd heard the bear. Heck, I had been closer to Woody and Stoner's site than Pack Mule. ""Nope,"" I said. ""I wear earplugs. Besides, I was dead tired and sound asleep. That bear could have crawled into the hut and kissed me and I'd have never known.""","Bearfence Mtn Hut
",Rock Springs Hut,"Jul 24, Fri",11.50
Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508728,"Big day today. Would hike my first 14 miler. OK, I'd hiked 13 miles a couple of other days earlier in the trip, so 14 miles shouldn't have seemed so much. But it was. Any time you add an extra mile over a rock strewn path with sharp inclines and declines, you feel that last extra mile. And along my route today I would climb to the top of the highest peak in the park - The Pinnacle.But I had a few aces in the hole for the trip. The first was a stop at Skyland Lodge for lunch. No wayside grill there, but there were plenty of goodies to be had in their store. That would beat another lunch of chunky peanut butter on a tortilla washed down with water. The second ace was my destination, Thornton Gap. Route 211 went thru that gap and I planned to hitch a ride to a town called Luray. My sore feet called out for a ""zero"" day on Sunday. Plus my clothes and body smelled so bad I needed to soak both in warm, soapy water. Some supplies were needed, too. The third ace was the prospect of magnificent overlooks. Ever since leaving Big Meadows Lodge there were more frequent and grand overlooks. My map suggested I was in for a treat!The hike to Skyland proved relatively easy. I arrived about an hour before noon to music. At first I thought someone was blaring their radio, but I was wrong. There was live music being played on the grounds by a Celtic band. Lively tunes that blended in well with the surroundings. I found the shop and discovered a snack bar complete with fresh sandwiches, chips, Gatorade, etc. Needless to say I bought a load of goodies. Then I found a shady spot and table on the outside terrace to sit, eat and listen to great music. After lunch and a refill of my water bottles, I hit the trail again. The trail soon converged into rocky ledges with grand overlooks. Folks, they were the type of overlooks that just can't be captured by a photo. I tried, but only got little pieces of their majesty in my photos.Hiking along these cliffs I came upon rock climbers just completing an ascent. I have great respect for rock climbers. Tried it once with my youngest daughter, Becca, when she was in college. It was then I decided I was a terra firma type: give me two feet on solid ground anytime.While taking a few photos of the climbers, a solo female hiker came down the trail going in the other direction. We exchanged greetings on this cloudless, sunny and hot day, She stopped to chat and I soon learned her trail name - Groceries. Great name! Knew immediately who did the food shopping in her household. Groceries was married and her husband was to join her on the trail soon. As a southbound we, she had already completed the fabled ""Roller Coaster"" just beyond the national park and before Harpers Ferry (my ultimate destination for this leg of the trip). Groceries said it was hard - made worse by the high temp and humidity. Sounded like a challenge!Sometime later in the afternoon I took a side trail to a picnic area. Needed fresh water and an energy bar. Sitting at the table I'd chosen I spied two people I knew - Woody and his son Stoner! Those were the fellows that invited a bear into their campsite for a late night prowl. We greeted each other warmly as fellow travelers with a common purpose. After our break, we continued on hiking together. We made our way to the top of The Pinnacle together and took photos of one another. Then we parted ways after reaching the Byrd's Nest Hut, their destination. I still had another three miles to go to my destination, so I bid Woody and Stoner adieu. They would be ending their trip the next day.I hiked on to Thornton Gap and the road. I knew once reaching the road that I'd have to hitchhike into Luray. It was 8 miles from the trailhead. Just before I arrived at the road, I was startled by a bear running across my path into the shoulder of the trail. He/she was a smallish bear and would not move further off the trail with my urging. I spoke to the bear calmly an walked by it, snapping a couple of photos while doing so. Cute bear....I got to Thornton Gap and stuck out my thumb for a ride to Luray. Fifteen minutes passed before someone stopped. It was a guy in an old beat-up pickup truck. Wow, I got a ride! I opened the door and old clothes, McDonalds food wrappers and other assorted garbage littered the passengers seat and floor. I pushed the junk aside, sat down in something very wet and said thanks. The driver looked at me and said he was on his way to the liquor store. He grabbed the green iridescent skull on the top of his gear shifter, pushed the lever into gear and away we went. Hey, it was a ride.....","Rock Springs Hut
",Thornton Gap,"Jul 25, Sat",14
Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/510292,"I took a zero day in Luray on Sunday. That gave me the time to shop for resupplies, launder my trail clothes, see something of the town, eat real meals, and generally rest my weary body.After that zero day on Sunday, I was blessed with a trail angel on Monday morning! The president of the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club, Dick Hostelley, agreed to give me a ride from my motel in Luray to the AT trailhead at Thornton Gap. Many towns along the AT have lists of volunteers willing to give hikers a ride to or from the trailhead near their town.   The local Outfitter in Luray had given me this list when shopping there on Sunday. And I lucked out on the first call! Donations to the trail angels were optional, and I did take advantage of that option. Hey, he agreed to drive me 8 miles to the trailhead.Dick wanted to get an early start in the morning to which I agreed. I was at the trailhead setting the length of my trekking poles just before 8:00 am.My destination on the AT that Monday was Gravel Springs Hut, a little over 14 miles ahead. There would be no stream or other reliable water for the first 8 miles of the journey. That meant carrying a full supply of water with me, along with new food supplies from Luray. Water is one of the heaviest components of a backpack - a full load of food being first on that list. Bottom line: a heavier pack for this first leg of the trip. And that first leg would be uphill, but only for a couple of miles.Of course the first few miles of the trail were a steep uphill. It was a humid day and the temperature rose quickly. Sweat poured forth as result. Those nicely laundered hiking clothes were quickly sodden with perspiration.I did have an interim objective, however. The Elkwallow Wayside was about 9 miles ahead. It was a camp store and grill. This meant a hot lunch, plus the last chance for a blackberry milkshake! My short-term motivation was high.I should tell you that I subscribe to the ""take 5"" rule every 60 to 90 minutes. That is, stop, take the pack off and sit down for 5 min every hour. Of course, the availability of a suitable rock or clearing on the trail determined exactly when I would stop for said break. Those brief breaks help immensely with muscle fatigue. Gives the body a chance to rejuvenate. Quaffing down an energy bar every 2nd or 3rd break also brings my performance level up noticeably. One burns a tremendous amount of calories slogging up and down mountains with a heavy pack.It was just after a ""take 5"" break that day that I saw them. I hadn't gone more than a city block after the break when a mama bear and two cubs popped out onto the trail not 50 feet in front of me. Stopped me cold in my tracks. Mama saw me immediately and looked worried. The two cubs were as cute as any store-bought teddies. I chose not to scream to try and frighten them. Instead I spoke firmly and asked mama to move off the trail with her babies. They all turned tail and quickly waddled away from me up the trail. Again, very cute. And boy was I relieved!I got to Elkwallow Wayside about 1:00 pm. Two miles per hour is about average for me on mountain terrain. I got a hot sandwich, my Blackberry milkshake and some other incidentals in the camp store. Thunder was rumbling in the distance. Elkwallow wayside has the disadvantage of not having any cover over any picnic tables - all are exposed. I chose a spot near the johns that provided some cover, ate my lunch and watched the brief rainfall.After lunch I headed out onto the trail north towards Gravel Springs Hut (shelters are called ""huts"" in the national park). There was a 1,000 ft climb over two miles immediately ahead of me. Not huge by the standards of thru-hikers, but a challenge for this section hiker. I'd need the energy provided by that nice lunch and rest to tackle it.Just as I hit the AT from the ""blue blaze"" side trail to Elkwallow I ran into Lil' Bean again (thru-hiker). What a nice surprise! She was headed in the same direction. It would be nice to have some company on the trail - provided I could keep up with her. Chatting with Lil' Bean on that uphill would take my mind off the pain (somewhat). I tactfully suggested she take the lead to set the pace.So we hiked and chatted - or should I say Lil' Bean chatted and I mostly listened. Since getting separated from her hiking companion, Gadget Girl, Lil' Bean had been hiking alone. She likes to talk and I'm sure she appreciated the company as much as I did. As we hiked uphill, Lil' Bean continued to talk as I struggled to keep up. On occasion I was able to get a word in edgewise. Then it happened. She was hiking almost effortlessly in front of me when she started to twirl both trekking poles like batons. Like batons! I was digging in my poles and pulling for all I was worth to help propel me uphill as my tired legs pushed. And she was twirling her hiking poles!I reached a new speed in my uphill hiking that day. I only hoped she didn't slow herself down too much for my sake. Lil' Bean had also stopped in Luray for supplies and was carrying a heavier pack than normal (remember, it was still about the same weight as my backpack). That may have been to my advantage and allowed me to keep up.We caught a nice downhill to Gravel Springs Hut and arrived a couple of hours later. There we met Tarzan, another thru-hiker. After a brief rest, Lil' Bean and Tarzan decided to hit the trail again and hike another 8-9 miles to the next shelter. Lil' Bean was anxious to try and catch up to her traveling companion, Gadget Girl, who'd left a message for Lil' Bean in the Gravel Springs Hut log. So, off they went at about 4:00 pm.Every shelter or hut has a log book. Campers or those just passing thru (like Gadget Girl) typically put entries into the log. Sometime it's a note for another hiker. More often it's information about their personal hike and/or their stay at the shelter or surrounding campsites (there are typically many level campsites near each shelter for those who wish to tent camp). This log book warned of a copperhead snake that lived under or near the hut. Just a few days earlier, an overnight hiker found the snake wrapped around his shoes at the hut. I decided to keep my shoes in the hut on the floor that night rather than on the dirt in front of the hut. Worked.I thought I was going to be all alone that night in the hut area. After eating my dinner (freeze-dried something rehydrated and eaten from a glorified zip-lock bag), three other young hikers blew into camp. From their equipment and supplies it looked like they were pretty inexperienced. They brought a big black pot and a huge bag of bloody steaks for their first night on the trail. We spoke briefly about bears. Fortunately, they chose to cook their steaks far away from the picnic table that sits in front of each shelter. They were kind enough to offer me some, but I declined having eaten my gourmet dish. Besides, I didn't want that smell on my body. Bears have an olfactory capability 7 times greater than a bloodhound.The 3 young hikers elected to tent camp that evening, so I had the hut to myself. I had already spread out my bivy sack (pictured)on the deck of the shelter, inflated my air mattress (put inside the bivy) and put my sleeping bag in the bivy. It is a very light bivy weighing only 7 ounces, and it has a bug net over the face area. An elastic string can be tied to a nail or other support above the bivy and keeps the bug net off my face. The whole idea for using the bivy is to keep the ever present mice from running over me during sleep, along with keeping spiders and other insects at bay during the night. It basically acts as a small tent inside the shelter.So, at hiker midnight (9:00 pm), I turned off my headlamp crawled into the bivy and got another great night's rest. That Neo-Air mattress made all the difference. Oh - and I kept my shoes inside the shelter too.....","Thornton Gap

Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/510321,"Up at sunrise in Gravel Springs Hut. No copperhead in or on my shoes (Hooray!). Learning to eat and pack quickly. Taking off my dry camp clothes and putting on my still sweat-soaked hiking clothes from yesterday is the biggest challenge. Hey, leaving on the dry clothes would only result in two sweaty sets at the end of the day. The high canopy of trees in this forest allows only dappled sun to get to the ground. The trees are 100 to 120 feet high. The ground stays moist as result - with the only exception being areas at high elevation where the rock overlay prevents many trees from growing. Hanging up wet clothes on a line in camp in the late afternoon does little to get them dry. Have another 14 miler today. Going to bypass the next shelter and go on to Front Royal, the northern terminus of the Shenandoah Nat'l Park. I could cut a few miles off by stopping at a shelter (hut) instead. But I plan to stop at a newer hiker hostel called Mountain Home. It's just a few steps off the trail, but a few miles further down the trail than the shelter/hut. The promise of a real dinner, laundered clothes and a decent bed provides the motivation for this trek.Of course the first part of my hike today will be uphill. That's fine, it's when I am the freshest. There will be more down than up after that, so the trip will be a little easier. However, in the back of my mind I was thinking - what goes down must eventually go back up in the mountains. Tomorrow could be a bear.While hiking along I chanced upon a buck feeding on ferns beside the trail. Because this was still in the Nat'l Park he was quite docile and hung around while I took photos. If you enlarge the photo to the left, you'll see that his antlers are still in velvet. Eventually they will grow to full length and the velvet will start to shed. The buck will help rid itself of the old velvet by rubbing his antlers on a tree limb or trunk. The antlers will then be a bone white or ivory color. Then he'll be ready for the rut. Handsome as can be.I got to Mountain Home about 4:30 pm. I knew exactly how to get there from the trail because I was able to get a call in to Lisa, one of the owners of Mountain Home. The photo of Mountain Home on their Facebook site is of a huge plantation mansion. Lisa kept telling me to go to the cabbin (yes, two ""b's"") over the phone. When I arrived, I naturally started towards the large imposing structure. Lisa popped her head out the door of the much, much smaller cabbin and said, ""Over here!"" I was a little taken aback. The cabbin was quite small - no bigger than 20' X 20'. It had two floors. The upstairs had three single beds and the only bathroom. I had to bend my head at the toilet to do my manly thing as the ceiling was angled at that point in the bathroom. Didn't favor tall dudes.The first floor had three rooms - two small rooms with beds and a small kitchen. Lisa and her husband slept in one of those first floor bedrooms. You get the picture - this place was small. But it was cosy.Lisa explained that she and her husband were in the process of renovating the old plantation mansion. It is of the classic variety with huge pillars on the front porch. And it is old! One section was built in the 1840s, with a second section added in the late 1860s. Yes, the original owner had slaves on the property. The cabbin was used for some of them.There were two other hikers using the cabbin that night, Bama and her gentleman companion(forgot his trail name!). Bama was a mature hiker from, of all places, Alabama. She and her companion had covered large sections of the AT over the years. Her partner had hiked the whole thing, coupling it with the Florida trail as well. That gave him real bragging rights. He'd hiked from the Florida Keys all the way up to Mt. Katahdin in Maine!Lisa drove me in to Front Royal so I could get cash (for payment), KFC for dinner, and to launder my clothes. She came to pick me up when I was through as well.Part of the offering at Mountain Home is a tour of the old mansion. She and her husband were working towards making it a B&B upon completion of renovations. At Lisa's beckoning, we donned our headlamps late in the evening and headed out to the plantation home. It was a wonderful tour. Lisa knew the intricate history of the plantation and its original owner. We were treated to a look at every nook and cranny of the old home. Many substantial renovations had already been completed. Lisa explained that she and her husband were trying to get tax credits through the Nat'l Park Service by keeping the renovations true to character. Of course, that added a layer of red tape that slowed progress.After the tour I managed to eek out a text to my wife, JoAnn. I gave her the overview of the mansion. I also promised to take her to the mansion once it has been completed. Shows promise of being a real gem! As I suspected, JoAnn didn't object to the proposal.In the morning, Lisa treated the 3 of us hikers to a fine breakfast. After that, I was off on a trek to Manassas Gap Shelter. It would only be an 11 mile hike. But I recalled my thought from the previous day on that hike mostly downhill; what goes down must eventually go up on any trail inn the mountains. I was about to find out there was some truth to that idea......","Gravel Springs Hut

Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/510578,"The day started early. I found myself awake in the hiker hostel's bed just at dawn. It wasn't daylight that caused me to stir, but the quiet packing of the other two, more experienced hikers. They were already dressed and starting the chore of repacking their backpacks.I quickly dressed and made my way downstairs. Seemed odd at first to have slept in the same room with two strangers - one of them being a woman. But that's the informality of the trail. Same thing happened in the trail shelters. Modesty at camp was stepping to the side of the shelter just out of eyesight of others to change a critical piece of clothing. True for men and women alike. Others respected your need for a brief moment of privacy.The breakfast at Mountain Home Hostel was great. Eggs, toast, a variety of jams and jellies, grits, plus a ton of coffee and a lot of fun conversation. I was polite and didn't ask for seconds. I still didn't realize it, but I was not eating enough. My caloric intake was still way below what I was burning on a daily basis. I was hiking over 12 miles per day on average - and that average was rising as I added more 14 mile days. With a 35 lb backpack on mountain terrain I was burning between 3,000 and 4,000 calories per day. What I was carrying in my food pack, including energy bars, didn't equal more than 2,500 calories per day. When I reached Bears Den Hostel a few days later, I stepped on a scale and was stunned to find I'd lost 10 lbs in just under 2 weeks on the trail.I quickly packed up after breakfast. Then like the old Woody Guthrie song, I bade my new friends a ""so long it's been good to know you......."" That's the unique thing about hiking the trail. You meet people, share stories and develop a common bond, connect with them at their level, then move on in the morning and never see them again. The anonymity of trail names ensures it.Well, I was going to bring down my average daily mileage today. Only planned a 10 mile hike to Manassas Gap Shelter. Recall I was now out of the Nat'l Park. And also remember, a lot of the trail was downhill yesterday. And what goes down in the mountains, must go back up. And so it did on this day's trip.The day was humid at the start. It became hotter as the day progressed - perhaps one of the hottest since I'd started the trail. Lowland temps were to be in the mid-90s. Even a cooler temp of the upper 80s in the mountains coupled with that humidity made the day a real killer. My first climb out of the gap was 1,000 ft.I planned on stopping at the Jim and Molly Denton Shelter about 4-5 miles up the trail. That would allow me to resupply with water. Besides, I wanted to see that particular shelter (see photo). It is one of the newest in Virginia and had a few nice amenities. One of them was a solar heated shower. Seemed that every woman I met on the trail wanted to overnight at that particular shelter. So I wanted to see this ""Hilton"" of the AT.I made it to the Denton shelter without much trouble. After inspecting the premises, resting on that fine Adirondack bench on the deck, eating my energy bar and slaking my thirst with fresh spring water, I again hit the trail. The heat kept rising.It was on that next uphill, the one just before Manassas Gap Shelter, that it happened. I bonked. I hit the wall. Scientifically, the glycogen stores in my liver and muscles were depleted. I had no fuel left in the old boiler. It was a struggle to make that last 900 ft climb. I stopped many times - something I had not done on any previous day. But I made it. No sweeter sight ever was that sign for the turnoff to the Manassas Gap Shelter. Sweat was steadily dripping off my arms and legs. Every clothing item I was wearing was soaked, including my hat. Boy was I glad that was over. I decided then I needed to carry more food - especially more trail food. But I would not have that opportunity to stock up until Bears Den Hostel. They advertised light re-supply.During my hike I had heard the voices of young people behind me. Amazing how loud kids can be in a place of quiet beauty like this forest - and how far the sound travels. But it had helped with the motivation to complete the hike before they were upon me. No dignity in having young teens see an older guy struggling along. Shortly after I'd set up my sleeping arrangement in one of the ugliest shelters on the AT at Manassas Gap, the young people arrived in camp. Fortunately, they were shepherded by counselors from the school program whence they'd come. And they chose a large campsite some distance from the shelter where I was ensconced. Nonetheless they had to come by the shelter to access the trail to the privy. I playfully gave each of them a hard time when one would ask directions to the outhouse. I'd point the way, and add, ""But it's out of order."" This seemed to cause special consternation on the part of the girls. It was just like teasing my daughters when they were younger......As I was about to start boiling water to add to my freeze-dried delight that evening, the last hiker arrived close to 6:00 pm. She was a heavyset older woman with a noticeable New York accent. I would characterize her as the classic Jewish grandmother (whether she was Jewish or not!). She chose a campsite not far down the trail from my ugly shelter, then joined me at the (only) picnic table that graced the front of every shelter. I introduced myself as Blazer. She introduced herself as ""More-to-Go."" Like me, More-to-Go was a section hiker. She had already completed many different sections of the AT. Living in Syracuse, NY, she had ready access to the trail. More-to-Go was a southbounder, while I was headed northbound. Starting at Bears Den Hostel, she had hiked the lion's share of the fabled Roller Coaster section of the AT in northern Virginaia - 10 miles of it to be exact. That was just two days earlier. She announced her trip was through early however. It was the heat. Just proved too much discomfort for her. More-to-Go was hiking on south to Front Royal the next day, then had arranged for her husband to pick her up for a ride home. She mentioned staying at a new hostel, Mountain Home. I gave it a very good reference.More-to-Go informed me that she had good information from a knowledgeable source that the shelter I was camped out in had a resident copperhead living in it. I laughed. Every shelter, I said, had snakes living underneath them. I would, however, keep my hiking shoes on the platform in the shelter that night, rather than on the ground in front of the shelter.She did give me a good tip about how to hike the Roller Coaster. That section of trail is marked by continuous steep up and down hills with very rocky terrain. She said on the downhill side in the hollow (or holler), there was always water. The trick was to guzzle water and empty your water bottles before tackling any uphill section of the Roller Coaster. Take empty water bottles uphill (lighter pack), then refill in the hollows, guzzle water and empty the bottles, then take on the next uphill. I thought it sounded like a good idea. Since More-to-Go had just been thru the Roller Coaster, there was still likely to be water in those hollows. I thanked her for the strategy.The night went by quietly. No copperhead joined me in the shelter or was found wrapped around my hiking shoes in the morning. Even though I was sure of that outcome before nodding off to sleep the night before, I did elect to keep a long trekking pole within short reach of my sleeping bag. You figure out why.....","Front Royal

Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511149,"I'll be narrowing the gap to Harper's Ferry today. There's less than 40 miles from Manassas Gap Shelter to that destination town. But within those 40 miles lay a few obstacles. One of the biggest was the Roller Coaster, a 13 mile stretch of rock-strewn straight ups and straight downs. My objective today wasn't to traverse that section of the AT. Rather, it was to get smack up against it by landing at Rod Hollow Shelter some 13 miles ahead.Rain had been forecast for today based on a report obtained in Front Royal 24 hours earlier. Normally that would be cause for some concern, but given the hot, humid weather of the previous week, a nice rainy day was welcomed. Might just cool things off.My first objective on the trail was Dick's Dome Shelter some 4.5 miles ahead. There I expected to find Crooked Run, a nice gushing creek I front of the shelter. I'd resupply my partially filled water bottles at that creek.I had a little bit of ""up"" on the trail today, with a lot more horizontal and ""down."" This would be the quiet before the storm - a relatively easy day of hiking before hitting the Roller Coaster tomorrow.When I arrived at Dick's Dome Shelter a couple of hours later I found a woman walking the campground. She explained that she was looking for her son - a young man with a disability. She lived with her son and husband just a mile or two away from the shelter over a ridge. Her son often came down to the shelter area on walks.We chatted about the very old shelter and the campground area. She pointed out that a new shelter was being built in the general area of Dick's Dome, but a 100 to 200 yards away. She added that a new privy was also being built. It was then that I smelled the old one. She pointed to it on a hill not to far from the old shelter and the creek. She told me a wet streak was visible on the rocks leading from the privy towards the creek below it. I mentioned it didn't seem a good idea to draw water from the creek since the privy was upstream of the shelter and obviously leaking into it. She agreed. The woman informed me of a spring that was two miles ahead and would be a better water source. I thanked her, donned my backpack and grabbed my trekking poles, then started hiking on to that spring. My water bottles were very low.When I arrived at the spring, it was barely dribbling water from the rocks. A small pool had collected in front of the spring's head. I was lucky. I had a Sawyer mini-filter that required me to fill a small bag with water, then push it thru the filter. Collecting water in a bag from a pool of water is not easy. In fact, it's downright impossible to get much of anything in a bag with a small opening unless the bottom of the bag is below the opening. That can't be done in a pool of water. I pulled out one of the most helpful tools I'd brought in my pack. It was half of a small plastic water bottle, the kind you buy at a gas station already filled with water. I'd cut any empty one in two with a sharp knife before the trip, keeping the funnel end (side with the cap). Made it easy to dip it into the water, fill the funnel (cap still on), then pour the spring water into the water bag. End result, plenty of water for my supply.I arrived at Rod Hollow Shelter about 4:00 pm. Had a canopy cover for the picnic table about 30 ft from the actual shelter. Would be real convenient on a rainy day (which, by the way, didn't happen today). No one else was camped out in or near the shelter. As the evening progressed, no one else hiked in to join me either. I would be solo at this campground this evening.I took my food sack from my backpack and hung it on the bear pole provided at the shelter. A heavy steel pole with a ""U"" welded to the top was in it's holder on the side of the bear pole. The idea was to put the ""U"" on the top of the pole thru a loop on the food bag, then lift it up to a hook at the top of the bear pole and put it in place (see photo). With enough colorful food packs up on the bear pole, it started to resemble an Xmas tree of sorts.With my sleeping gear set up in the shelter, water from the campground spring in my water bottles, food in my belly from my freeze-dried dinner, I waited for ""hiker midnight"" before settling into my sleeping bag. Much harder to stay awake until 9:00 pm after a long day's hike (even though it wasn't a particularly strenuous day) when there is no one else around for company. But, I managed to make it. Going to bed too early just means waking up in the dark at 4:00 or 5:00 am in the morning, then laying there until first light. So, I forced myself to stay up.When the appointed hour did arrive, I gratefully slid into my sleeping bag. And with my food pack hung, I had minimized the possibility of having an uninvited guest prowling around my shelter area during the night - or so I hoped....","Manassas Gap Shelter

Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511526,"Today is the day! The Roller Coaster awaits! Thirteen miles of steep ups and downs, with very little respite in between. As pictured, those straight ups and downs were over lots of rock (and that trail does go straight up in that photo). That type of footing alone guaranteed it would take longer to traverse the trail. Lots of huffing, puffing and sweat went into hiking this trail. Eyes would be glued to that trail as well - very little time to enjoy the scenery.But there was a light at the end of the tunnel. Bears Den! A hiker hostel some 10 miles hence that boasted some of the best accommodations on the AT. For $30 bucks a hiker would get a bunk, a shower and towel, a chance to do laundry, plus pizza for dinner and a pint of Ben & Jerry's ice cream. Wow!! That would really hit the spot after today's hike. And for breakfast there would be pancakes with syrup. Did I mention that?I was fortunate. I had planned my food provisions to be fairly light by this point in the trip. I would only need one and a half day's supply of food in my pack from this point forward to Harpers Ferry. I could reach Harpers Ferry within one day after Bears Den, assuming I felt like hiking 20 miles. Not likely though. There would still be 3 more miles of the Roller Coaster to traverse after leaving Bears Den. I was in much better hiking shape after almost two weeks on the trail, but still not at a tough 20 mile/day level. I'd need to stay out one more night after Bears Den before reaching Harpers Ferry.Aside from the light food supply in my backpack (oh, that trusty backpack!), I also planned to use the strategy told to me by More-to-Go back at the Manassas Gap Shelter. That was to rely on water being available in all the hollows of the Roller Coaster. I would guzzle water at Rod Hollow Shelter and empty my water bottles to lessen weight. Then I would hike to the first hollow, purify some of the stream or brook water there, guzzle it, then take the next uphill towards the next hollow with empty water bottles. Would do the same thing at the next hollow and available water supply. Carrying water is heavy. My water bottles would weigh 4lbs when both filled. So carrying empty bottles made sense when the water supply from streams or brooks was plentiful.OK, it was a tough trek. My distance averaged a paltry 1.6 miles/hr. Dancing on rocks as pictured slows a hiker down considerably - especially when it's uphill, or downhill for that matter. There are no great views on the Roller Coaster either. Nothing to break the monotony. The only mental high was getting sight of the light thru the trees towards the top of each uphill. Now that lifted the spirits!I would later meet thru-hikers who scoffed at the Roller Coaster. They said there were other sections of the AT that were just as tough, and maybe tougher. I couldn't argue with them not having hiked those other parts of the AT. But my body told me that day that I'd put it through a real test of endurance. Perhaps one of the toughest endurance tests this section hiker had experienced in a long, long time - if ever.I saw no other hiker on the Roller Coaster that day - at least until a mile or two from Bears Den. That hiker hostel was accessible by car. It had a nice view of the valley below it from a rock outcropping along the AT in front of it. So there were people that drove up there to park and day hike. Besides, the grounds of Bears Den and the building itself were beautiful (as you will see in my next post). So that was an attraction for sightseers as well.That was the longest 10 mile hike I'd ever taken. And when the end came and the sign for the Bears Den side trail was visible - oh, was I happy! And what a sight it was when I turned that last corner of the side trail and the hostel became visible. But more of that in tomorrow's entry.....","Rod Hollow Shelter

Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511827,"Bear's Den had been a great respite! I arrived a little early the day before at 4:00 pm. That's an hour before the Bear's Den Hostel opens for hikers. Sign said hikers entered thru rear of the building. I chanced going to the door and hoped I might get in early. It had been an exhausting hike through the Roller Coaster. Fortunately a workman was out back splitting logs with a log splitter. Boom! It sounded just like a gun going off. I'd heard it some miles away while still hiking and thought it was just that - someone taking shooting practice with a rifle. I made that comment to the workman, a very friendly fellow. He told me I could go into the hostel early and gave me the combination to the door lock.Wow, I was in! And the first to arrive. That meant I had the choice of bunk beds (10 altogether) and I could be the first one in the bathroom shower. My clothes had sweat through (again) during the hot, humid day's hike. I peeled them off. My hat was pretty wet, too. Believe me, that hot shower felt awesome! I lingered, hoping no other hiker would arrive and want a shower right away, too. There weren't any. In fact, there weren't any other hikers in the hostel that whole night. I had it to myself - at least in the bunk area.I stepped on the scale after my shower. Yep, I had lost 10lbs in just under two weeks. Confirmed what I already knew. I needed lots more calories for fuel during the day while hiking. If I didn't pick up some more trail food and snacks I would start to loose muscle mass as my body started to scavenge protein for calories. Bear's Den sold that type of light re-supply.After my shower, the door between the hostel bunk area and the main building was unlocked just about 5:00 pm as advertised. I could go upstairs and formally check in. The manager lived on-site. He was a great guy and introduced me to the particulars. I was shown the freezer where stacks of huge Tombstone pizzas were located. All the different varieties of toppings made my mouth water. Below the pizzas were pints of Ben & Jerry's ice cream in different flavors. I got both for the price of admission to the hostel. Tonight would be a feast. And after having stepped on that scale, it would be guiltless!Cooking at Bear's Den is do-it-yourself. The large kitchen allowed more than a few people to be in it at the same time. Both the workman (who also lived on site) and the manager were starting to prepare their evening meal. The manager was a self-taught chef who loved to prepare foods. He was in the middle of preparing a huge fresh salad with many items from the garden out back - including fresh picked tomatoes. He generously asked if I wanted some of his salad. I said something like, ""does a bear sh.. in the woods?""I slipped my pizza into the stove, then went downstairs to put my clothes in the laundry. I'd lugged breathable rain pants along in my pack without using them the whole trip. Now I knew why. That and my fleece vest were the two items I wore along with sandals while laundering every other stinking clothing item I had, including my hat.After my feast, I sat in the comfortable living room pictured to read a bit. Both of staff later came in to join me for conversation. I found out that Bear's Den was built by a physician and his wife in the 1930s. They modeled it after villas in Europe. It served as their summer home. After both original owners passed, it sat empty for 20 years. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy ultimately bought it after the AT was re-routed near it. Great resource for backpackers!As I talked to the two staff, my eyelids became heavy. I told them it was time for me to turn in. They laughed. It was just before 9:00 pm. They both chimed in to say, ""Hiker Midnight!""The next morning I prepared my own pancakes, then packed my gear and started northbound up the AT. I was headed for the David Lesser Memorial Shelter some 12 miles away. Between Bear's Den and that shelter lie 3 more miles of the Roller Coaster. That did limit my speed on the trail. Was I glad to reach the end of the Roller Coaster to see the sign for southbounders announcing its start. The trail did improve some after that landmark. I recalled log entries of other hikers at Bear's Den. Through hikers labeled the Roller Coaster ""horrible,"" ""tougher than I thought,"" and so on. Agreed.I was passed on the trail by two hearty looking fellows carrying light packs and ropes. Climbers, I thought. Must have come in from a side trail. Another few miles up the trail confirmed that thought. I came upon a rock outcropping and cliffs. There were the two guys roped up, with one ready to rappel down the cliff. I took a couple of photos at a distance and waited. Nothing happened after many minutes. I walked up to them and asked if I could take their pictures and they cheerfully said yes. Nothing happened. Finally the one hanging over the cliff looked at me and said that they were both pretty new to rock climbing, so they were taking their time to make sure everything was done just right. I decided to move on. Didn't want to hang around and hear the thud.Along the way to the shelter was the Blackburn Trail Center. I decided to take the side trail to see it, even though I was not going to stay there. It consisted of a stately old summer home that had been built by someone very well-to-do in years past. It had a full, wrap-around and screened in veranda. Unlike Bear's Den, hikers could not stay inside the nicely appointed Blackburn Center building. There was a small cabin with 4 bunk beds some yards from the main building for hikers. No food was available at the Blackburn Center either. I couldn't understand the concept. A caretaker got to live in this posh building and the hikers were restricted to the veranda and the small cabin or campsites. The caretaker ate steak at night inside that mansion, while the hikers dined on freeze-dried mush prepared outside on a camp stove. They won't get a donation from me for that Trail Center.Along the way to the Lesser shelter, I happened upon a hiker traveling south. He announced he'd traveled the Lake Superior Trail and was now headed south on the AT from Harper's Ferry. He intended to make it all the way through to Springer Mtn in Georgia (a little over 1,000 miles), then go on and complete the 1,400 mile Florida Trail. Heavy-set guy with a beard. I figured he'd lighten up considerably in this heat with all those miles ahead of him. Before we parted, he made comment about the humidity in this section of the country (remember, we were in northern Virginia). I said nothing - just smiled and thought of all those miles he planned to hike further south, including those in Florida.The rest of the hike to the shelter was pleasant and uneventful. When I reached the Lesser Shelter, I found myself alone. Very nice shelter. Relatively new with a broad deck and railing in front of it, plus an Adirondack bench to sit in. There was a nice canopy covered picnic table 100 ft away from the shelter, too. And, oh yes, a snake in the rafters of the shelter. Looked like a rat snake. The rafters were 15 ft above the sleeping deck of the shelter, so I was not deterred. I set up my bivy and sleeping bag in the shelter. I figured I wouldn't be bothered by many mice with that rat snake hanging around. I was correct.Small world. Later that day a couple of hikers came in to camp. Was a Dad and his adult daughter. He lived in Indianapolis, while she lived in Washington, D.C. Daughter worked as a legislative aide for Sen. Donnelly from Indiana. I had just visited D.C. a month or two earlier to do some lobbying and had met with one on Sen. Donnelly's aides. We shared stories. Nice father/daughter combo. I knew I was getting close to real civilization when that happened. Other than environmental issues, politics is not discussed much on the trail. Usually invites too many conflicts. Not this time.Tomorrow - on to Harper's Ferry, West Virginia......","Bears Den

Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512001,"Short hike today - only 8.5 miles to Harpers Ferry and a motel room. I was going to meet my youngest daughter and my nephew there late today. Would share the day with them in that historic town tomorrow, and take a rafting trip with them. After that, Ben (nephew) and I would head south to hike the AT along the Grayson Highlands State Park. Had a reputation for being beautiful. And I'd heard that from more than one through-hiker who had traversed the area. Lots of down hill today. That would make it fairly easy. Plus it was a short hike compared to those I'd just hiked the past week or so. I'd heard from other hikers that I would be impressed with the last leg into Harpers Ferry. There was the added benefit of having the main office of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy in that town. Made sense since Harpers Ferry is the official halfway point between both ends of the AT - Springer Mtn in Georgis and Mt Katadhin in Maine. Thought I might stop there and get some info about other sections of the trail, plus compliment them on the fine job the ATC performs maintain the trail. All done with volunteers.Even though I was only halfway through my month-long trip, it was somewhat bitter-sweet heading into Harpers Ferry. Ended the first leg of a very memorable adventure. I could only hope the next two weeks of my trip would be as great as the first two. But spirits rose when I thought of seeing my daughter, Becca, and nephew, Ben. How wonderful to see family in the middle of the trip and spend time with them. Even better to know that I would be spending time with Ben for the coming week on the trail. Backpacking was new to him, but Ben was in great shape and I knew he'd love the challenge.There was another milestone on the trail today. I would be leaving Virginia and going into West Virginia. Must remember that my destination was Harpers Ferry, WV.The hike was a breeze today. Light backpack as my food supply was down to emergency provisions only. That and the downhill made for a fast pace. Along the way I started to run into many other people - especially as I got to within a few miles of Harpers Ferry. Many day hikers out on what was a beautiful day. The closer I got to the town, the more it started to resemble a walk in a big city or county park. The last downhill section was a treat. The views of the Shenandoah River were awesome. The AT actually goes over a main bridge into the town. That's where I took the photo on this page.When I got to the other side of the bridge over the Shenandoah, I happened upon a couple of young women backpackers going the opposite way. I stopped briefly to chat. They were just starting out on their hike with intentions of putting on a 100 miles or so. Their backpacks were almost as big as they were. I took pity knowing what they faced just 17 or 18 miles ahead - the Roller Coaster.   I told them the hostel at Bears Den was worth the stop and the few shekels. I also shared the insight provided me by More-to-Go back at Manassas Gap Shelter just before I hit the Roller Coaster. I told the girls there was water in all the hollows between the peaks of the Roller Coaster, and that they could lighten their load by guzzling water at the water holes and going on with empty water bottles up and over to the next water hole. They seemed appreciative.As I rounded the corner on the road leading to the bridge, I say my destination. The Econolodge lay just a block from the trail. My wife, JoAnn, had made the reservation there for us. What a great coordinator! Couldn't have done better myself.For anyone who hasn't already visited Harpers Ferry, it is worth the effort to go there. Beautiful town.

Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542972,"Getting the last few details wrapped up before I start my trip on the Vermont Long Trail this Sunday. Will be flying out to Boston on Saturday, then taking a bus back to the western side of MA. Will overnight in a small village called Williamstown. Sunday morning I'll hike to the edge of town and pick up the Appalachian Trail (AT), taking it north. In just under 4 miles I'll be in Vermont!At the VT/MA border, the Long Trail begins. It coincides with the AT going north along the ridge of the Green Mtns for the next 105 miles. When the trails reach Killington, VT, the AT veers due east towards New Hampshire and its terminus in Maine. The Long Trail, however, continues north thru Vermont along those same Green Mountains all the way to Canada - another 165 miles or so.I'll be trekking north on the Long Trail from the MA border for 163 miles to a dip in the mountain ridge called Appalachian Gap. There I'll leave the trail and meet my wife, JoAnn, at a small inn in the Mtns. No, I'm not hiking the last 110 miles of that trail all the way to Canada. Decided it would be better to spend that last week with my honey. She'll fly into Burlington, VT, rent a car and meet me at the inn near Waitsfield, VT. Sounds downright romantic, right? Fresh, exuberant woman meets smelly bedragged man stumbling out of Mtns. I think I get the better part of this deal......Jo and I will spend our week exploring New Hampshire's White Mtns and Portsmouth. The latter is an old whaling and fishing town on the coast of the Atlantic. Then we'll head to Boston for the flight home. I'll keep you posted of my exploits along the trail, and of my time exploring with JoAnn. That is if there's a decent cell signal up there.....Blazer",,Getting Started,"Jul 20, Wed",0
Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543510,"Stepped onto the Appalachian Trail (AT) just outside Willamstown, MA. BTW, Williamstown looks like a real nice place to visit. Williams College started there in 1772. Every building in the town has that old colonial look - even the banks. OK - back to the trail. Remember, the Vermont Long Trail (LT) and the AT are one and the same for the first 105 miles going north along the Green Mtns in Vermont. Must take AT to get to the Long Trail at the VT/MA border. That's why the photo!First Trekker I met in the AT that day was Rainbow - so named for the multi-color bandana on his head. Rainbow was a thru-hiker. Started from Springer Mtn in GA last year. Blew his knee out in PA. Pointed to a long scar on his right knee as proof. Now he was determined to complete the trek this year. We talked of our hiking experiences together. A kindred spirit developed.We moved thru the lower part of the trail together, talking. The trail grew sharply steeper, the physical demands of the hike took over making our conversation more infrequent. Soon that practiced athlete began to separate from me. Then he was gone. Like so many other souls I've met on this trail, I never ran into him again. Weather this first day was outstanding! Sunny and in 70s with cool breeze. After 6.8 miles I reached the first shelter at 12:30.   It was ugly. The nearby stream had dried up and wasn't flowing. Their was a pool of standing water between the rocks. Ugh! Dry season in VT. I held my nose and purified the water. After lunch and a rest I decided to press on for the next shelter. Heck, it was only 7 more miles and the day was young!About 5 miles into that trek I began to sense my legs were starting to object. There is a big difference between being in shape on flat land and mountain hiking shape. Oh well, I only had two more miles to go.Had been hiking with a nice family I met along the trail - two pre-teen boys, mom and dad. The boys were out front while I trudged along 20 feet behind. The boys climbed over a downed tree to follow a path that widened to a rough road. I followed. (Big mistake!) So did mom and dad. About a half mile later I realized I'd not seen any white blazes (AT trail marker) on the trees. I stopped to check my special app on my phone - the one that places me on the trail using GPS and an arrow. You guessed it, we were heading directly away from the AT and nowhere near it. That downfall we had all climbed over was to prevent hikers from taking the wrong route.So we turned around and headed back to find the correct trail. And find it we did, just the other side of that deadfall. Little side trip added another mile to our journey. Got to Congdon Shelter about 6:30 pm, dog tired and hungry. Lots of people camping in the area, including a Brit and a woman wearing an NRA cap. She went by the trail name of Fox Fire. I did not mess with that woman! Not that I was intending to. The evening ended with a young woman and her dog coming into camp at 7:30 pm. She and her dog, Princess, had just covered the same route I'd taken (less side trip) in 2 hrs less time. Like I said, there's flat lander's shape and mountain shape. She hailed from the mountains.","AT in Massesechusets

Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543948,"One word: Ouch! Not the same spring in my step today after doing 15 miles yesterday. But, I only had 4 miles to hike today to Bennington. I had a food drop at a motel in that town.The first 3 miles out proved uneventful. Stopped at a real pretty spot overlooking the town. There was a lovely large shade tree there. I sat with my back against it, gazing out over that serene view and resting my aching legs.Then I heard it. Noise was coming from somewhere further down the trail. It kept getting louder. Then it defended directly upon me at my spot. Twenty pre-teen kids and their summer camp counsellors burst on the scene! And I'm not exaggerating - they burst in. There was no stopping that train - or quieting them. So I collected myself and quickly left.The last mile proved particularly arduous. The steepness of the descent was ridiculous. Picture one of those Hobbit movies with stairs at an angle that makes you wince just to look at them. Well, the director of those movies got his inspiration from this section of the AT. But I made it to the bottom and parking lot without injury. At the bottom of the trail I tried to call the motel for a ride into town (4 or 5 miles). No luck - only one bar. So I decided to hitchhike. Walked out to the road and stuck my thumb out. First vehicle coming out of the parking lot was a real old fashioned Hippie van - complete with psychedelic scrawls on the side panels. Guy driving looked at me, smiled and said, ""Want a ride?"" He had a strange gleam in his eye. I thought about the offer for a split second, but it was hot, I was tired and sore, so I said, ""Sure!"" And I hopped in. The inside of the old van was as highly decorated as the outside. The driver waived his arm behind us to the back of his van. ""I live I this thing man. What do you think?"" ""Nice,"" I said. ""Looks a lot better than where I slept last night.""I survived the ride. Heard all about the Rainbow gathering recently held in the area, plus some other ramblings about trying to save the earth, etc. He was a nice enough guy, just a bum with some style. When we got to the motel I threw him $10 and said thanks. He took the cash, held it up and said, ""This is going for gas, man - for gas. ""Right,"" I thought and jumped out of the van.Next time I walk to the motel or take a taxi.","Congdon Shelter

Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543963,"Got a ride to the AT trailhead from the son of the hotel mgr. Young guy. He was East Indian, like so many other small motel owners nowadays. Told me his family had just bought that motel just two months ago. Since running a motel is such a big endeavor, he had offered to help his parents with its operation. I thought that laudable.""So where did you move from,"" I asked? Atlanta was the reply. Having seen a bit of the community the day before, I remarked, ""Pretty small community, Bennington - and awfully white."" That really opened him up. Went on to tell me there were only two other Indians in the town, and virtually no other people of color. Talked about all the amenities in Atlanta, plus its large Indian community (translated - there were more women he could chose from). Didn't sound like a guy who would put down roots in Bennington.Hit the trail at 8:45 am. Only 10.1 miles to go today, but it was all up. A nice steep rise of 1,300 feet in the first 2.5 miles, followed by downs and ups (mostly ups) for another 1,000 ft. elevation gain to the Goddard Shelter. It sat just below the summit of Glastenberry Mtn. Believe me, the cumulative rise of all those ups and downs was much more than an additional 1,000 ft. I completely sweat thru my clothes in the first 60 minutes (1.5 miles) of the climb. Dripping with sweat. This would have been a hard climb even without a 30 lb. backpack. Boulders and rocks littered the trail (see photo on 1st day of my hike for example).When you loose so much moisture thru sweat, you loose a lot of salt. That has to be replaced - water alone won't do it. If you don't then you get dizzy and light headed, plus water alone never seems to slake your thirst. I was so glad to have those electrolyte tablets. I dropped them into the water bottles freely - even though they made the water taste terrible.OK - I made it to the shelter alive by 3:00 pm. There eating his post hike snack was Peter (he refused to use a trail name). Peter was a bit younger than me and doing the same thing - section hiking. I had met so many thru-hikers (I.e., GA to Maine) that I thought we section hikers might be in the minority.Peter turned out to be a retired actuary. Had been on the AT for 17 days. We chatted a while and found common ground on many issues. Hey, he brought up politics and economics - I didn't.We were soon joined by a slew of thru-hikers and 4 other section hikers. Most of the thru- hikers stopped briefly for a snack, then shouldered their packs to add more miles. As Copper Kettle put it, ""If I don't do the miles today, I'll just have to do them tomorrow."" Buy this time in a thru-hike (about 1,600 miles out of 2,100 total on the AT) the daily hiking starts to become more like a job - a daily grind. Only one thing keeps them going - Katahdin, Katahdin, Katahdin..... They sense the end is at hand.Some still have a sense of fun and adventure about them. Such was the case with LC and his female companion, Snickers. I think she made LC laugh. And he bore the heavier load on his back for her (told me his pack weighed 40 lbs). Better to go on a long trip with someone you care about rather than alone - just like in life. Anyway, they went to the top of Glastenberry Mtn to camp. There is a fire tower on top of that Mtn giving exceptional views, especially of the sunset.We had two campers right next to our shelter that evening. A young couple from Vermont who had just married. They were spending their honeymoon hiking The Long Trail. Hearty Vermont stock! And very nice people, too.Peter and I shared the shelter with Joda that night. He was another solo thru- hiker that came in late. Too dark to travel on, so he stayed. Both Peter and I turned in at hiker midnight - 9:00 pm for anyone else. Joda was still cooking his evening meal in the gloam of the evening as I slowly nodded off to sleep......","Bennington, VT

Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543974,"Got up and hit the trail early. Bade farewell to Peter and Joda. Had 12.5 miles ahead of me. Needed to camp at a location called, Kelley Stand Rd. Guidebook said there was a clearing with campsites next to a river on the AT just north of the road. More important to me was that location put me smack at the base of Stratton Mtn. The next day I would have to hike up that beast - the highest Mtn in southern Vermont.Stopped at the top of Glastenberry Mtn to take in the view atop the old fire tower. That structure was built in the 1920s. Made to last I guess. LC and Snickers were in their tent sleeping near the tower. Joda passed me on the trail shortly after the tower.The AT is definitely rougher here in VT than it was last year in Virginia. Very rocky trails. Constant ups and downs climbing over or in-between those rocks. And very, very few views in the high elevations. Where there were some, I wouldn't bother to pull out my camera. It was truly a ""green tunnel"" as some have described this part of the AT.But I made good time. Nine miles into my hike I stopped at a shelter for lunch, only to find Joda. Told me he had laid down and slept for an hour before I arrived. Gives you an idea of just how much faster an experienced thru-hiker travels on the AT compared to us normal folks.As I was munching lunch in came LC and snickers. They had gotten up, broken camp, packed and caught up with me. I felt like a snail. Peter showed up just as I was leaving, too. He was done with hiking. Looking to get out at Manchester Center. Said he might join me at Kelley Stand Rd or camp short of that mark because he was pretty tired. Off I went. Only 3.5 more miles to go. About a mile from Kelley Stand I came upon a beautiful camping spot. It was at the side of a wonderful waterway called Black Brook. I was really tempted to stay, but I pressed on for Kelly Stand. You see, I had to do a total of 14+ miles hiking the next day, which included climbing Stratton Mtn. I just didn't want to add another mile to that total the next day.As I neared my final destination I stepped aside for 3 hikers going the other way. One of them said, ""Trail Magic at the road ahead."" My spirits lifted immediately. Trail magic means someone was handing out free food! This handout is typically meant for thru-hikers. I decided a white lie was in order in this situation if necessary (or should I say my stomach made the decision)! Freeze dried gets real old real fast.As I turned to hike towards the magic, LC and Snickers blew past me. The breeze from their passing almost knocked me down. ""Trail Magic"" was all I heard from them as they went by. I tried to keep pace with them, but they quickly outpaced me and were gone.When I got to the road and parking area it was a beautiful site. Screened tent with two wonderful people waiving me inside (see photo). Inside were LC, Snickers and Joda - all smiling and holding beverages or plates of food. I was offered a chair and choice of beer or Gatorade (chose the later), choice of bun, meats, tomato, butter, potato chips, macaroni salad and more. And I didn't have to lie to get it! It was quite a feast.Afterwards I thanked the couple profusely, then rolled a 100 yards into the woods and found a nice campsite. As I was setting up for the evening, LC and Snickers trotted past. They were going to do that darn mountain - 6 miles to the other side and a campground. That means they will have done 18+ miles that day, including Stratton Mtn.Around 7:30 pm, 3 more hikers arrived and asked if they could share the campsite. ""Sure"" was my reply. They were 3 brothers from New Hampshire - all men with families at home. They were hiking The Long Trail from north to south. Had just completed a 21 mile hike that day - including that mountain at the end. They make real men out there in New Hampshire!When they finished setting up, we sat around the fire pit to chat. They ate mountains of freeze dried food. Homemade freeze dried food. High calorie count meals are a must when you hike that much and burn so much energy. They were great guys to spend the evening with. Just about hiker midnight (9:00 pm), we all peeled off and turned in for the night. There were more miles to hike tomorrow for everybody.","Goddard Shelter

Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544025,"I rose at first light, 5:30 am. I thought I might best the 3 brothers camping near me by rising first. I crawled out from my bivy, shimmied thru the opening in my tarp tent and found I was wrong. The 3 brothers from New Hampshire were up, dressed and starting to break down their camp. When you plan to hike 20 miles or more thru the mountains, you have to get started early. We all went about our business in silence. When they were packed and walking out of camp, the youngest brother offered a simple hiker's refrain, ""Good hike."" We shook hands and they were gone.I managed to get myself underway at a respectable 7:30 am. I had 14 miles to hike myself today. So I started up Stratton Mtn. It was 3.4 miles to the top.I was alone for most of that first 3.4 miles. Then towards the top of the mountain the path really steepened. I struggled up over the rocks with my pack load. Then I heard a rustling behind me. I turned and saw another hiker slowly overtaking me. I hiked on, but soon had to step aside an let the other hiker pass.Darned if it wasn't a woman who passed me up! And a pretty skinny little woman at that - carrying a pack as big as mine. I knew she had to be a thru-hiker. Still hurt my manly pride for just a moment, but only a moment. There are a lot of women out there on the AT. And I've been buzzed by more than one in my time on that trail. No way a section hiker like me can keep up with anyone who's hiked over 1,600 miles in the past few months.I stopped at the top of the mountain just after she did. There was a fire tower atop the mtn, built in the 1930s by the CCC. She had gone up for the view and I joined her. We chatted - or should I say she chatted. Said her trail name was Task Master and her given name was Sara. She had started the trail in GA with her father. He was forced to drop out after 600 miles with painful shin splints. Task Master shared more details of her hike, family and friends for a while. I just listened.Loneliness is another reality of a solo hike on the AT. Yes, there are friendships made along the way with other hikers. But those friendships are more often transitory. Hikers get separated for various reasons - a need for resupply at a town or medical attention, a family matter, or one hiker just wants to move on a few more miles while there's daylight, or stop to take a nap at a shelter. Loneliness is a reason some thru-hikers just give up, too. They get to thinking about a loved one and can't abide the separation any longer. So they just quit the trail.After our brief exchange, Task Master and I parted ways. She was a nice person. With a waive and a ""Have a good hike"" we went back to the challenge of the trail. In a flash she was way beyond me.I made good time after coming down off that mountain. Trail was much more reasonable in general. Water was becoming an issue. Very dry. Springs were just barley a trickle. Had to get water from one hole that may not have been moving. Took my chance and purified it, then moved on. The trick is to carry only enough water to get you to the next water hole. Water = weight, and less weight on your back is preferred.Got in to Manchester Center at a respectable 4:15 pm. Not bad with regular stops for rest, water and food. Checked into my motel, only to find my food package had not arrived. After some investigation by JoAnn, she found it at the post office in Manchester Center. Would have to pick it up the next day during business hours. Used that problem and my sore legs to declare the next day a zero (miles on trail) day. So, I booked an extra night, cleaned up and went out for a fine dinner up the road. Sure beat freeze dried...","Kelley Stand Rd

Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544630,"I had really hoped to take a day off from hiking, but my hiking clothes were really stinking and the laundromat was a couple of miles from the motel. In addition, I had to retrieve my food drop package at the Post Office. That was near the laundromat. So I walked.Met another thru-hiker at the laundromat - Bigfoot. Claimed it was given him because of his large stride. I looked at the size of his feet and initially thought otherwise. He had covered the 1,600 miles from Georgia to Vermont in just three months. That's fast. So I guessed that long stride must be true.Bigfoot told me he was a recovering alcoholic. Had started the trek on the AT as part of his recovery process. Bigfoot's 12 step meeting sponsor wanted to go along and started with him in Georgia. Problem was the sponsor was older and in no condition for the rigors of an extended mountain backpacking trip. He had to drop out during the first week. The Georgia Mtns are considered second only in difficulty to the Whites in New Hampshire and the rugged terrain of Maine. After experiencing the difficulty of southern Vermont's mountainous section of the AT, it made me wonder how I would fair in those more challenging environments.I did learn from a local that I was lucky to have gotten a motel room. Manchester Center is home to an annual equestrian event involving 1,600 horses over many weeks. And I had landed in town smack in the middle of it.I did rest the remainder of the day. My sore legs demanded it. Because of this unscheduled stop and zero day, I changed the ultimate course of my trip. Decided to forgo going north on the Long Trail at the AT/Long Trail junction at Killington, VT. Instead I decided to continue on the AT as it made a right turn and headed east towards Hanover, NH. That new route would be somewhat less mileage (154 miles total) requiring fewer days to travel. I communicated with JoAnn so she could arrange to meet me in Hanover.","Manchester Center

Blazer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544631,"First, let's go over some nomenclature. NOBO is a north bound thru hiker. They start in Georgia or someplace south on the AT and are headed for Katahdin in Maine. SOBO is a south bound thru hiker. They have started at Katahdin in Maine and are headed south to Springer Mtn in Georgia. SOBOs must start much later in the year than NOBOs. Baxter State Park in Maine doesn't open Katahdin until late May or early June due to the snow. SOBOs typically start in June as result. They take on the toughest part of the trail with beginner's legs. Ouch!Those that start somewhere between Springer Mtn in GA and Maine heading north are called flip-floppers. Once they reach their goal in Maine they will catch a ride back to where they started and head south, finishing their thru-hike in Georgia in late fall. Back to my trip. I left Manchester Center with the intention of slowing down and doing a max of 10 miles/day. I had to climb Bromley Mtn from the get-go upon leaving Manchester Center, drop to Md Tom Notch, then promptly climb Styles Peak. And that would cover the first 8 miles. I would stay at Peru Peak Shelter just a couple of miles further up the trail. But plans change. I got to Peru Peak Shelter about 3:00 pm. Was a beautiful day with lots of time left. I ate a snack, purified and drank some water, then decided I could easily make the next shelter. It was just under 5 miles away. So off I went.Along the way I had to scramble up the rock face of Baker Peak. Bit of a challenge. At the top I turned around and was awestruck. I had a 160 degree view of the Taconic Mtn range, with the tallest, Dorset Peak, directly in front of me. A thru-hiker I'd met earlier was nearby. We both looked at one another and said a photo wouldn't do justice to the grand view. Then we promptly took out our smartphones and started taking pictures.Made it to Lost Pond Shelter about 5:30 pm. Hiked 14.7 miles that day. Was only three other hikers there when I arrived. All were thru-hikers, with one being SOBO. Over the next 2 hours or so a dozen more hikers converged on that shelter area. Most camped in the area surrounding the shelter.As they gathered around the fire pit to sit and talk it was clear that 12 of the 15 hiker there were thru-hikers. Seven were NOBOs and 5 were SOBOs. We had a bubble! They shared stories and asked questions. The NOBOs wanted to know about the Whites in NH. The SOBOs told them about the extremely variable weather in the Whites and confirmed the difficulty of the climbs up those mtns.As the light dimmed in the evening, the hikers began to peal away from the group to retire. And I did so too. Tomorrow would be another long day on the trail. And the prospect of rain loomed in the forecast.","Manchester Center
