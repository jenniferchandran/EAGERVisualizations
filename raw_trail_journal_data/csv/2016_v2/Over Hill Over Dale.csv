Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543400,"This will be my fourth summer to hike a section of the AT. I will start at the Partnership Shelter and the Mt Rogers visitor center near Marion VA. I started a blog for my fall hike, but I never posted it. There are two significant things about where I ended my fall hike. 1) It has a shower. I think it even has a water heater that burns wood. I thought it would be a kind gesture if I showered while waiting for my wife to pick me up. The shower worked, but not the water heater. It was a brisk October shower.2) The city of Marion VA runs a city shuttle to the trail and Marion is a stop on Greyhound routes. I can take a bus from Louisville to the trail! I got dropped off on Sunday night at the Louisville Greyhound Station. The bus ride was from 7:50 at night until 10:50 the next morning. It would be kind of a long bus ride, but I figured I could get some sleep on the bus.It was a great plan … now for the reality. The first leg of the bus ride was from Louisville to Nashville, TN. It was an express route so there were no stops. All of the bus passengers were African-American except for me and a young man from India. That didn’t bother me, it is just an observation. It actually made me think about our society’s inequality that so many African-Americans are traveling by bus while white folks are flying or driving cars to get around the country. I also noticed that the black bus riders seemed to know how the system worked and the Indian and I were clueless. I ended up sitting with the Indian and I learned that he had only been in this country for a week. He completed medical school in India and was looking for a place to do his residency. We talked most of the way to Nashville; he had many questions about how things worked in the U.S. and what our culture was like. I could help him with most of it except how riding Greyhound worked.My plan to sleep on the bus was not very realistic. We got to Nashville at midnight and didn’t leave until 1:50. During that time everyone had to exit the bus. You can’t sleep in the bus station unless you can sleep sitting up on metal benches with metal arms between seats. I decided to go across the street to a convenience store and get something to eat to pass the time. Of course I had my backpack on my back which was a little tricky in the crowded aisles of the convenience store. I got an individual size pizza and sat on a bench outside the bus station to eat it. The bus station was definitely in the black part of Nashville. It was after midnight, but there was plenty of activity on the street. As I sat eating my pizza, a young black man came walked by and said, “There is a cockroach getting into your pizza.” I looked down and saw a cockroach heading across one side of the cardboard box – straight for my pizza. “Thanks,” I said. He replied, “When you’re raised in poverty you spot those things a mile away.” One reason I sat outside in the sweltering heat to eat my pizza was that there was a lady with a crying baby in the terminal. Of course I kept hoping that she was waiting for a different bus, and of course she was not. We loaded the bus and headed towards Knoxville. About 15 minutes before the Knoxville station the baby finally stopped crying and fell asleep. We pulled into the station, they turned on all of the interior lights, and announced that everyone had to exit the bus for an hour and a half. By this time I felt sorry for the mother. She and the baby were both sound asleep and they made them wake up and exit the bus.About 5:30 A.M. we got back on the bus. This time, as we headed to Northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia we stopped at every little town along the way, until we finally reached Marion, VA and my section hike was about to begin.","Columbus, IN

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543370,"The bus dropped me off at the Greyhound bus station at 10:45. I was the only passenger that got off. The driver pulled my pack out from the storage bin under the bus, handed it to me and said, ""Have a good hike."" After raining the whole bus ride, right now there were gray skies and no rain. I took that as a good omen. There is a city shuttle that goes right to the trail, but it didn't run until 2:30. I decided it was worth the $18 for a taxi. But first I stopped at the Food City next to the bus station to buy three apples to go with my almond butter for lunches. Apples are pretty heavy for pack food, but I thought three of them sounded reasonable.I called the taxi company and before I had the apples packed away into my food bag, they were there to pick me up. He drove me to the Mount Rogers visitor center, the spot where I got off the trail last October. Less than a tenth of a mile south on the trail is the Partnersip Shelter. I didn't stay there, but it is one of the very few shelters on the AT with a shower. It looked like there was the capability to heat the water by burning wood, but on that cool October day at the end of my hike lady fall, I took a brisk shower in all cold water. I have learned that when I am about to get picked up after backpacking, a shower, no matter what the condition of the shower or the temperature of the water, is a good thing. It at least begins to wash away some of the backpacker smell ... although the pack itself smells pretty bad, and I can't take it into the shower.I filled my water bottles at the visitor center and headed north on the trail. I hadn't planned to hike far the first day because I thought I might be a bit sleep deprived from the all-night bus ride. It was 11 miles to the next road crossing and there was a $35/night hotel there. With rain predicted that seemed like a good idea. The taxi driver also told me about a great restaurant where the trail comes out to that road. It's called the Barn. I shouldn't be thinking about food on my first day out, but he made the Barn sound like an experience not to be missed. About 3 miles from the road and the Barn Restaurant I met two hikers heading south to the Partnership Shelter. They told me they had stopped at the Barn for lunch, but it was closed for the 4th of July. I shouldn't have spent so much if my hiking time thinking about what I would eat for supper. When I got to the road, I checked in at the little hotel, got out my jetboil stove and fixed a supper of trail food outside my room. After supper I went to the gas station next door to treat myself to some ice cream. I met two other hikers and their dog. They had just come from Partnership Shelter and were checking into the same motel and paying $10 extra for their dog. I should say they came from Partnership Shelter today. Last year they started at the southern end of Shenandoah and went 1000 miles north. This year they started in Georgia and were hiking to the Shenandoah.","Mt Rogers Visitor Center/ Partnership Shelter

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543372,"The next morning I didn't see Elisa and Kolby, the couple with the dog. I did have two interesting conversations at breakfast. The Barn restaurant was open so I had a big breakfast before hitting the trail. There were only two customers, me and a truck driver. He asked me about the trail and he told me truck driving stories. He drives a route for Walmart between Tennessee and Virginia. He asked me about bears on the trail and I told him I have never seen one on the AT. I told him about the time we saw one on the road after my wife picked me up from my hike from Georgia to the Smokies. Two weeks in the forest and no bears, ten minutes on the road and we have to stop so a bear could cross in front of us. He said he sees them on the interstate often. Recently he saw one in the median that seemed confused about how to escape his predicament. He also said he ran over one once that had already been hit. He wished me well on my hike and I wished him well on his drive.I filled up both of my water bottles with filtered water from the restaurant and headed out as another hiker was headed in. His trail name is Wring Way. He is doing a ""flip-flop"" thru-hike, going from Georgia to Harper's Ferry, West Virginia, and then starting in Maine and hiking south. He said he had until Thanksgiving to finish. Hiking through Pennsylvania in November sounded like it might be cold. I would have done the northern have in the summer, but everyone does their own hike. I thought maybe I'd be hiking with him, but he was taking a zero day because of the expected rain. As tempting as that sounded, I couldn't take a zero day on my 2nd day out. Besides I had new Gortex socks to keep my feet dry. We wished each other well and I headed out to the trail, across a highway, past the gas station, under an interstate, and finally into the wilderness, it had already rained the night before and everything was wet. It wasn't long before I was wet. Then the rain came. I was hiking with a light-weight umbrella which seemed to work great. Any rain gear I have tried leaves me soaked on the inside from sweat, so wet that I can't tell if it is keeping out the rain or not. The umbrella at least kept the rain off of my head, my upper body, and kept my glasses dry. It also meant I could enjoy the cooler air brought in by the rain. The only down side was that I had to put away one hiking pole to hold the umbrella. That's not s problem in flat terrain, but there is very little flat terrain on the AT.By mid-afternoon the rain had stopped. I hiked through another pasture with some cattle. They watched me, I watched them, and we all went about our business. The big news of the day was that my new Gortex socks didn't keep my feet dry. I don't know if it was walking in wet grass in the morning, or rain running down my legs, or sweat coming from the inside, but by lunch time, I could ring water out of the socks from both sides of the Gortex lining. And that had produced blisters on two ties on each foot. I put blister pads on them at lunchtime hoping it would help. I don't know if they got worse or not, but they didn't get any better. I hated getting blisters on my second day out.Early in the day I ran to a sign on a tree that said I was 1/4 of the way fro Georgia to Maine. I think it was supposed to be encouraging, but I found it to be a bit depressing. This is my fourth year of hiking and I have 3/4 of the trail to go. Later I talked to a man who finished section hiking the AT in 2014, thirty-three years after he started. That means I could finish when I am 92 years old. Hmmm.I came to a nice camp site, but I decided to sleep in a shelter because it was supposed to rain again that night. The next shelter, Knot Maul Branch Shelter, also had nice tent sites and I always sleep better in a tent, but I hate packing up a wet tent and the weather did not make it Simons like I could spread the tent out tomorrow to let it dry. I opted for sleeping in the shelter. It turned out I was the only one in this shelter that night. I am always a bit relieved when no one is around when I hang my food bag. I out a rock in a dirty sick, tie it to the rope and throw it over a horizontal branch for the one rope method, or over a fork in the tree fit the two rips method. It her way it is embarrassing how many throws it takes for not get the rope over the right branch.There were either no mice in the shelter or I was so tired and slept so hard I never heard them. Either way, it was a good night ... and it didn't rain.","Atkins, VA

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543572,"Knot Maul Branch Shelter to Chestnut Knob Shelter10 milesToday's plan was to hike up to Chestnut Knob for lunch and then hike on from there before stopping for the night, Chestnut Knob was the first place with a view, so I thought it would make a nice lunch spot. I figured it would be about four hours. I thought about that as I started to hike up the mountain. In a way it is like planning to drive from my home in Columbus, IN up to Lake Michigan and the Indiana Dunes for lunch with a good view. It's about a four our drive. If you are going that far for lunch, you'd better enjoy the journey.I did enjoy most of the journey up the mountain. Actually I went up and down a small mountain first, Lynn Camp Mountain. Then before heading up the larger Chestnut Knob, I came to a gravel road and found some ""trail magic."" Someone had left a cooler of apples and bananas. So I had one of each and started up the mountain. I passed several huge expanses of ferns. It rained hard for a while and then slacked off to a steady drizzle. As usually happens in the forest, it is hard to tell when the rain is replaced by water dripping from the trees. I put away my umbrella, got out my second hiking pole, and then the rain started to fall again. Was it rain, or was it the wind blowing water out of the trees? Either way, I decided I was already so wet it didn't matter. About halfway up the mountain the trail followed a narrow clearing in the forest. It wasn't wide enough to see a view into the distance, but it was wide enough to see a blue sky with white clouds. At the top the forest opened up completely so I could see the farms in the valley below. The Chestnut Knob Shelter was unusual. It was made of stone, it had four walls and a door, it had windows, and it had a table inside. It was 3:00 by the time I got there and I knew I wasn't going to make it to the next shelter before nightfall. And I knew the next shelter couldn't be this nice. So I decided to stay for the night. I spread my clothes out on a rock to try to dry them out.   While I was spreading out my clothes an Amish family came by. They were here from Lancaster County, PA. They said the whole family came to Virginia by bus to visit one of their brothers who owned one of the farms we could see down in the valley. They had hiked up from there, a two-mile hike up the mountain. Soon after the Amish family, Ellsa and Kolby, the couple I had met two nights ago at the road crossing in Atkins, arrived at the shelter. They decided to stay in their hammocks. Soon after they got their hammocks up and hung their clothes on a line in the sun between two trees at the edge of the forest, it clouded up and started to rain. We all snatched our clothes as quickly as possible so they wouldn't end up even wetter. It didn't rain long, and afterward there was beautiful rainbow that looked as if it was coming right up out of the valley. It all made me glad I had decided to stop there for the day instead of hiking on. I went to bed about 9:00 after watching the sunset, and then I got up about 11:00 and went back outside to look at the sky decked out with thousands if stars. I enjoyed the mountain top view for a few minutes and then went back to bed.","Knot Maul Branch Shelter
",Chestnut Knob Shelter,"Jul 06, Wed",10
Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543593,"Chestnut knob shelter to Laurel creek campsite15 milesI packed up and left the shelter fairly early, about 8:00. After hiking down hill for about 45 minutes I realized that I didn't have the ankle brace I had gotten from my podiatrist. It wa to relieve some of the pain from the plantar fasciitis. I had set it on a rock to dry yesterday afternoon and in the rush to bring in my clothes, I must have forgotten it. Going back for it would cost me at least 90 minutes, and it was uphill all the way back. I decided the blisters I got from hiking in wet socks were much more painful than the plantar fasciitis at this point so I hiked on.It rained intermittently, sometimes hard. On my way down to a road crossing and Laurel Creek I met two ladies hiking up the mountain. They said there was a great campsite by the creek with a picnic table. A campsite with a picnic table is like a 4-star hotel in terms of AT camping. The idea of a great campsite motivated me to keep heading down the mountain. I was tempted to stop at a campsite near a road crossing because I heard thunder and figured another downpour was coming soon, but I hiked on to Laurel Creek. I found the campsite. Most of the areas flat enough for a tent looked like pooling places for rain water. I spent quite a while looking for a flat spot on relatively high ground. It was right next to a creek, so there was no actual high ground. I set up my tent and although it was only 5:00, but I washed up in the creek and got inside to read and nap because he rain was starting up again. After the rain several day hikers came by and woke me up. I was relaxing in my tent when another backpacker stopped by. He asked if he could share my campsite and I said ""Absolutely."" He set up his tent and I crawled out of mine to be a bit more social. He had started in Harper's Ferry. WV and was hiking south. His trail name was Rolly (pronounced with s long ""O"" sound) because he rolls his own cigarettes. When he told me that, I was trying to figure out how a smoker could go up and down these mountains with s pack on his back and not get totally winded.We had a great conversation. He said he hiked slow because he always stopped to take pictures - mostly of plants. That is weird because I also do that and most people don't even seem to notice the plants. So we compared pictures of wild flowers and colorful mushrooms. He also had a short video of a recent encounter with s wild boar. We both made use of the rain soaked picnic table to fix and eat our supper. He discovered that he had lost his only spoon. He was several days away from a town or a store, so I gave him my spare plastic spoon. He offered to pay me for it, but his could I charge him when k had received so much ""trail magic"" from others while hiking the AT. After supper, I had a cup of tea, he had a cigarette, and we both went into our tents to go to sleep while being serenaded by a nearby owl.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

When I got up, I put on wet clothes and packed up a wet rainfly. Everything except the shorts I sleep in was wet. Rolly and I were heading in opposite directions. I was ready to hit the trail before him because he sat at the picnic table and rolled his daily supply of cigarettes. He told me about a gas station in Bland, VA, the next town north that had a diner in the back with great food. I thought about heading into Bland and drying my clothes, even though I knew it was a temporary endeavor. It was 9 miles to the road and then three miles into town. Once I hiked up from the creek side campsite, it was fairly level hiking. I had two trail companions. One was a deer who didn't seem to mind that I was hiking on the trail about ten yards away. She did stop eating and watched me pass by. Later I passed a large skunk. I don't think it ever noticed me. I stopped to get a picture. I decided it was an optimization problem. I wanted to minimize my distance while taking the picture, but maximize the likelihood of my escaping without smelling any worse than I already did. I knew my chances of hitching a ride into town would be greatly diminished if I got sprayed by a skunk. So I kept a safe distance and snapped a photo.
As I got closer to the road crossing I heard lots of traffic. It is always a bit strange to hear the sounds of civilization invade the wilderness of the trail. But I thought, ""With that much traffic, I'll have no trouble finding a ride."" Then I reached the road crossing. It was a narrow, quiet, country road. The traffic noise was from the adjacent interstate that had an overpass, but no exit onto the country road. There were two hikers at the road crossing. They had just gotten dropped off to start a section hike going north. ""Too bad you weren't here 5 minutes ago,"" one of the said. ""You could have gotten a ride into town."" I thought that sometimes it is better to just not know information like that.
I didn't want to walk 3.6 miles to town, so I had to hitch hike. There was a curve in the road and a large gravel parking area at the trailhead. That would make it easy for someone to pull off and pick me up. If I started walking down the narrow, winding road, drivers might be afraid to stop. It seemed that the best plan was to hitch at that location. After standing and waiting for a ride for 30 minutes I began rethinking my plan. I needed to either continue on the trail or start walking to town. With a wet tent and all wet clothes I decided I needed to get to town. As I walked down the long and winding road, several cars passed but did not stop. I did get noticed by a dog as I walked past a house. I had to move to the other side of the road. That didn't stop his barking or his interest in me, but he never came closer than about 6 feet. People always talk about bears on the trail. So far my biggest fears have been (1) running out of water, (2) rattle snakes, and (3) dogs.
Several cars went past without stopping or even slowing down. I always look for patterns - it's one of the curses of being a math teacher. In my hitch hiking experience I have noticed the pattern that rides seldom come from new shiny cars, they come from older cars that are existing beyond their expected useful life. When an old truck came sputtering down the road, I had hope for a ride. Sure enough, he slowed down and offered me a ride. I threw my pack in the back, cleared enough stuff off the seat to make room for myself, and climbed in. I thanked him for the ride and he said he always picks up hitch hikers because he has needed rides before. There's a pattern that makes sense...if you knows what it's like to need a ride, you offer rides to others in need. I think there is s bigger life lesson there somewhere.
So I made it to the gas station/diner in Bland, VA and had the best hamburger I had in ages. In truth, I usually get a veggie burger at restaurants, but this wasn't the kind of place that had veggie burgers on the menu.
There was no laundromat in town but there was a hotel. I decided to spend the night and do my laundry there. I asked about the laundry and the hotel clerk took me around to the back of the hotel and showed me two tubs, a hose, and a clothes line. ""I'm afraid this is the laundry."" ""I guess that will work,"" I said. I put on the shirts I sleep in and put the rest of my clothes in the tub of cold water and added some of my camp soap. I washed them and rinsed them, wrung out as much water as I could, and hung them on the line. I also hung up my tent and rain fly to dry them out. Within five minutes a big black cloud came over the mountain and it started to rain. I quickly took down all my laundry, took it into my room, and spent the rest of the evening turning the heating/cooling unit from heat to cool and back to keep the blower going until the clothes were dry. It took the whole evening, but I was ready to hit the trail in the morning with a dry tent and all dry clothes.","Laurel Creek campsite

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543893,"he goal for today was to get to Trent's Grocery. Seems like an unusual goal for a hiker, but it is an unusual grocery. First of all they accept mail drops, so I had sent myself a box of food and supplies there from home - at least I thought I had. Also, they offer camping, a shower and laundry for $6. I didn't really need any laundry done, accept of course the clothes I was wearing would be soaked in rain or sweat or both by the end of the day, but a campsite and a shower was always a good plan.I got a ride back to the trail from a guy named Bubba. I had 19 miles to hike to get to Trent's Grocery, but there were no major ascents. One of the convenient things about hiking the AT is that, for the most part, when you have to pee, you just turn to the side and make sure you are aiming downhill. There is no chance of someone coming by at that time - well almost no chance. Just when I stopped and turned to the side another hiker came around the corner behind me. I let him pass and didn't chat much. Several miles later I met him again at the next shelter where he was eating lunch and I was planning to eat lunch. He was eating Ramen noodles - uncooked. He said people think it is strange and he can't figure out why. I asked what he did with the flavor packet, and he said he didn't use it. Hmmm ... Uncooked Ramen noodles with no flavor packet ... It would be sort of like eating the box. I can understand not wanting to get out a stove and cook lunch, but I wouldn't want too many lunches of uncooked, unflavored noodles. He was an interesting young man. His trail name was Chives; I don't know the story behind it. He was hiking from Damascus, VA to Pennsylvania where he lives. His arms were covered with tattoos, mostly of classic video game characters like Link and Mario brothers. He used to be totally wrapped up in video games, so much so that they permanently resided up and down his arms. In order to fund his hike, he sold all of his games for several thousand dollars. He finished his crispy noodle lunch and hiked on as I started my lunch. I rested at the shelter for a bit after lunch and then hiked on.I made the 19 miles to the road by about 4:30. Then I had to hike a half mile along the road to Trent's Grocery. Hiking along the road always seems to stretch out the distance, especially when it is a road with traffic and no shoulder. I was pretty disappointed when I got to Trent's Grocery. It was right across the road from a lumber mill. There were piles and piles of unmilled logs everywhere. The grocery itself was not exactly a grocery. It was a combination gas station, grocery, bait shop, ammunition shop, farm supply store, and lunch counter/grill. Chives was there and Elisa and Kolby were also there. I asked the clerk about my mail drop. It took her a while to check on it in the back room, because she was manning the store alone - if it is proper to say that a woman was manning the store. Every time the phone rang, or someone got gas, or wanted fish bait or a hamburger, she had to come out of the back room and help them. Finally she said there was no package for me. I couldn't figure out how that could be. I asked what time the mail came the next day and she sad about 10:30. I had hoped to be on the trail way before then. I asked about the camping, and she said she'd show me where it was when she got a break in helping customers.While waiting I talked to an interesting local resident. He owned about a hundred acres and harvested trees sustainably. He started talking about tree species that have been destroyed over the years. He remembered the American chestnut trees. When he was a boy area farmers sent their pigs up into the forest each fall to fatten them up on chestnuts. We talked about the new species they are creating by mixing Chinese and American chestnut trees. I said I think it is about only 5% Chinese chestnut. He corrected me that it is 1/16 Chinese chestnut. Of course it had to be a power of 1/2 ... It was a good thing he didn't know I was a math teacher. Now he is losing his hemlock trees. It is amazing how the other trees fill the gap, but it is sad that major tree species can't withstand the onslaught of invasive species that we bring in whether they are brought in intentionally or not.After we had talked for a while the store clerk came and pointed me to the camping area. It was away from the road, between a creek and a horse pasture. It was a nice grassy area with a large tree in the center, a shower house, and a few RV's that looked like they hadn't been moved in years. All in all it was't a bad campsite for $6 including a shower, and we could lock our food bags in the shower house so we didn't need to hang them from a tree.","Bland, VA

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543976,"I got up, loaded my pack and headed to the grocery store for a breakfast of eggs and bacon. I had debated with myself about waiting for the mail to arrive at 10:30. It didn't make sense to me that it hadn't arrived yet. I checked the notes in my iPhone and realized I hadn't sent the mail drop to the grocery store; I had sent it to Wood's Hole Hostel, my destination for today. I guess that explains why the clerk at Trent's Grocery couldn't find my package. In fact, I remembered why I had sent my mail drop to the hostel; they specialize in sustainable gardening and offer a gourmet, organic meal to hikers for a reasonable fee with lots of great food! I planned to stay there, sleep in a real bed, and have a great meal - oh, and pick up a mail drop. Chives and I hit the trail first. It wasn't long before he got ahead of me and I was hiking alone. I had blisters on both feet which impacted my hiking speed a bit. Of course the day started by hiking up away from the road crossing. A short connection to Dismal Falls came in the first mile or so. The falls weren't dismal at all, they were on Dismal Creek. In fact, with all the rain lately, the falls were going strong. There were also several stream crossings back on the main trail and one small elevation gain, about 1500 feet, with a great view from a rock outcropping near the top. By late afternoon, Elisa and Kolby had caught up to me. They had a later start from Trent's Grocery. I asked if they were stopping at Wood's Hole Hostel. Elisa said they were going to stop there, but when they called, they found out that the owners were on vacation. The temporary caretakers were not doing the meals. By that time in the afternoon, I had been thinking about that meal for about 5 hours! Well, meal or no meal, I needed to go there for my mail drop. We hiked together until the forest road that led to Wood's Hole Hostel. They were going on a few more miles. I was calling it quits at 15 miles - plus the half mile down the road to the hostel. At one point the trail wound among some large boulders. If I hadn't been close behind Elisa and Kolby, I wouldn't have noticed that the trail went over a large rock and dropped down about four feet between two boulders. It would have been a great spot for a couple white blazes, but I didn't see any. When I got to the hostel, there were three other guys staying there. Merlin (trail name) had hiked from Springer Mountain, GA. He was hiking until he was ready to stop, recently retired, no obligations of commitments. Gandalf (obviously a trail name) was a young, deaf man who had also hiked from Georgia and was ending his hike to go talk about hiking at a camp for deaf teenagers. The third guy was not a backpacker, he drove to the hostel. He was from New Zealand. He had two weeks to see the U.S. before heading to Colorado for a conference. He decided to spend the two weeks learning about Appalachia.   He is driving from hostel to campsite, doing day hikes, visiting small mountain towns, and talking with the proper. I was so impressed that someone would have two weeks in the U.S. and was spending it somewhere besides Disney World or New York. Plus he had just driven to the grocery store and he shared some fresh vegetables with me. A journalist from the Roanoke Times and his wife, a special ed teacher and reading specialist, were the temporary caretakers. They brought us some roasted vegetables and quiche. - for free! It was definitely worth the half-Mike walk to the hostel! And I got mail drop.","Trent's Grocery

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544139,"I got a ride back up the road to the trail. My feet were in such bad shape that I decided I better go into Pearisburg, the next town along the trail, to get something for the blisters. The trail had a lot of small ups and downs for most of the day, until the very end when there was a 2000 foot descent into Pearisburg. Right before the descent there were a couple great views, a knob and a rock outcropping, called Angels Rest, that stood above the trees. It was a great place for humans to rest before starting the steep descent down to the valley below. On my w at down I passed quite a few day hikers on their way up to the Angels rest. It was only 2 miles to the top from the Pearisburg side, much shorter than the 9 miles I came fro. Woods Hole, but it was also much steeper. When I was within a quarter mile of the trail head on the Pearisburg urge side, there was a group of fourteen age girls just starting up the mountain, mostly wearing flip flops. They asked me if there was anything to see at the top. I explained to them the view from the top and then asked if they new how to get to Pearisburg from the road. They said they have lived here their whole loves and that I just turned right at the road. First of all, I thought,""How could you have lived here your whole lives and you have never been up to the topic the mountain,and how could you think you can climb a mountain in flip flops. But I didn't say any of that. I said, ""Do you know how far it is I to town along that road."" One of the girls said it was 9 miles. My heart sank. That would mean I would have to try to hitch into town. The trail book made it sound like town was very close. The one of the girls said, ""There is a sign down by he road."" I hiked the last quarter mile to the road and there was a sign with an arrow that said Pearisburg 0.9 miles. I wanted to hike back up and explain place-value to the girls but I turned right and walked into town.I met two middle school age boys on the road heading toward the trail. They wear walking single file, and the boy in front was carrying a large American flag. I said, "" You look like a very short parade."" They said they were gearing up to the top of the mountain to place the flag at Angel's Rest. I wasn't sure how they were going to plant it into the rocky surface or how long the National Forest Service would leave it there, but they were definitely on a mission. I asked if they could recommend. a good place to eat in town. I don't know why I thought it would be a good idea to ask middle school boys about restaurants, but I did. I was I in the mood for some down-home cooking. They said there us Chinese, Mexican, Dairy Queen and Hardee's, and they recommended Dairy Queen ... Which didn't surprise me as the choice of two middle school boys. None of them sounded like the down-home cooking I had in mind. I also asked if they new where the post office was. I had a few things I decided to mail home to lighten my lack a bit. They said it's right next to the Andrew Johnson house and museum in Main Street. ""That's cool,"" I thought. ""I will have time to tour the museum museum before I check into the the motel."" I didn't even know Andrew Johnson was from Virginia.When I got into town, there were two motels, both right out of the 1950's, right next to each other. I chose the one with a pool. I dropped off my jack and went to the post office. On the way I passed the Andrew Johnston House and Museum. It was Andrew Johnston, not Andrew Johnson. While I was thinking of Lincoln's vice-president; this Andrew Johnston was known for being an early settler in Giles County, VA. The museum is only open three days a week, and wasn't open today. I went on to the post office and back to the motel.I have fairly low standards on acceptable motels, especially when I am hiking the trail. In the world of AT shelters, having a cold water shower is an amazing luxury, and mice are to be expected. So, while the bar for motels isn't very high, this hotel didn't make the cut. The drapes were broken and didn't close all the way. The carpet was in need of cleaning - possibly for the last several years. But there was a laundry room, so I washed out my wet clothes in the sink and dried them in the laundry room. I put on the shorts I sleep in and went into the pool, which was in the center of the parking lot. Before going into the pool I had to sign a form in the office freeing the motel of any liability for my safety in the pool. I really just wanted to start soaking my feet.For supper I chose the Chinese restaurant because it was next to a Goodwill and a Food City, and I was hoping to find a dishpan and Epsom salts for soaking my feet. I bought Epsom salts at Food City and found a pan for changing car oil for 99 cents at Goodwill. I took the oil pan and the Epsom salts into the restaurant and had an all you can eat Chinese restaurant. Then I headed back to the room to soak my feet as much as I could before going to bed.","Wood's Hole Hostel

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544152,"I decided it was time to take a ""zero day"" and take care of my feet, but I was not going to do another night in that motel. I had run into Merlin in the grocery store last night and he told me about a new hostel where he and Gandolf were staying. After breakfast at Hardee's, I tried to find the hostel, walking a mile and a half or two miles, with no hostel in sight. I went to the other motel in town, asked to see a room, and decided this was a much better option. I couldn't get the room until later, but I was able to leave my pack. I went to Andrew Johnston House and Museum. It was closed, but the yard offered a nice place to sit in the shade and read my book on my iPhone. The heat was almost bearable in the shade of the large tree, but I noticed dark clouds rolling in over the mountains.It was close to lunch time so I checked the Internet for other eating options. I found Nagel's Downtown Grille a few blocks away. It had great reviews. It seemed like the perfect place to eat lunch and wait out the storm. I got there and discovered that it was closed down. As I stood reading the fabulous menu that I couldn't order from, there was a large clap of thunder and it started to rain, a torrential rain. The doorway to the former restaurant was on the corner of the two main streets in town and was tucked into the building to offer just enough space to get out of the rain. I huddled back against the door and watched the rain for 30 minutes, thinking how great it would be if I were inside the restaurant eating a barbecue sandwich while I watched the rain. Since Pearisburg is a mountain town, the street was at a fairly steep angle. It soon looked like a mountain stream and then a river as the rainwater ran down hill. Cars driving by threw a wall of water over the sidewalk towards the covered steps where I was standing. I had to press myself against the door to stay dry.The rain let up, so I decided to head back to the hotel and wait out the storm there. I had my trail umbrella, but I was hoping to keep my hiking shoes dry, or at least close to dry. The street was still a river if rainwater. Every time a car or truck came by I had to press myself against the buildings to avoid getting splashed. I had gone one block closer to getting hotel when it started to pour again. I found another doorway to huddle in. This time it was a closed bakery. The downtown blocks of Pearisburg had the potential of being a picturesque mountain town. When you stood on the Main Street and looked either direction, there was a mountain rising up at he end of the street. The street was lined on both sides with old brick buildings. On the corner across from the closed restaurant was the county courthouse with nice landscaped grounds and a large statue dedicated to their confederate war heroes. But most of the stores were closed. The local theater was converted to a gun store. And there was no place to eat. After another 30 minutes of waiting for the rain to stop, I decided to head towards the motel. I actually went a block past the motel to Dairy Queen and had lunch there. Then I went back to the hotel, set my sport shoes on the air conditioner (which was tricky because it was a unit hanging high on the wall) and soaked my feet for a while. There was a nice overhang with chairs outside each room, south sat outside my room, read my book, and watched the storm with a view of the shopping center across the street and the mountains in the background.Before supper time, the storm passed and the sun came out. I found a place at the edge of the parking lot to set my hiking shoes in the sun to dry, put on my camp shoes, and headed across the way to the Mexican Restaurant. They had a patio out back with a great mountain view. While it wasn't the down-home, country diner I was hoping for, it turned out to be a nice place to eat. It was a good thing I was sitting on the patio, because I could see the dark clouds rolling in again. I told my waiter, I needs to go across the street to my hotel and move my shoes in so they wouldn't get rained on and then I would return. I didn't want him to think I was running out on the bill. I came back, and finished my meal on the patio but under the roof of the building. I walked back to the hotel to put my camp shoes on the air conditioner to dry and soaked my feet again. I guess when you hike about 12 miles per day you think about your feet a lot, but I knew I was leaving Pearisburg and heading back out to the trail. In my day and a half in Pearisburg I had eaten at all four of the restaurants, and shuffled in the doorway of the closed downtown grille and bakery. It was definitely time to move on.","Pearisburg, VA

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544195,"I got up and stuffed everything into my backpack in preparation for heading out. Before I put on my dry hiking shoes I examined my feet. It was amazing how much better they looked and felt with one day off from the trail. Of course they spent a good part of that time soaking in an oil pan filed with water and Epsom salt. I left the pan in the room and checked to make sure that was the only thing I left. Well, I also left two bags of microwave popcorn. I had treated myself to some popcorn and it was only sold as a three-pack, so I left the two I popped bags for housekeeping. Chives might have taken the to eat unpopped popcorn for lunch along with his uncooked Ramen, but neither sounded appetizing to me.I did plan to eat breakfast before hiking back to the trail. I had two choices; Dairy Queen or Hardee's. Somehow, a,though they did have a breakfast menu, Dairy Queen didn't feel like a breakfast spot to me. Maybe I didn't trust myself to order a breakfast that did not include ice cream in some form. So I opted for Hardee's. In Pearisburg, Hardee's is the hangout for retired men. There must have been 16 men eating breakfast, drinking coffee, and catching up on local news. There were no women, and at 62, I was easily the youngest patron in the restaurant by about ten years. The big topic of discussion was the drowning that had taken place at a local waterfall called the Cascades. The volume of water coming over the falls was greatly increased by all of the rain. People often swam in the pool below the falls, but the increased volume of water created a dangerous current that pulled a boy under. The boy's father went down to save him and lost his own life in the process. The son survived. After breakfast I had to hike about a mile down the road to the trailhead. I am not one to asked directions, but sometimes it is easy to overlook where the trail goes into the woods from a road, and a young man was pulling into a small commercial parking lot as I walked past. He got out of his car about 15 feet from where I was walking on the road so I asked if he knew where the AT headed. Roth near here. He pointed to a stop sign about half a block away. ""It is directly across the road from that stop sign."" I didn't see a trailhead at all, but I walked to the stop sign and went directly across the road. There was a blue bandana tied to a low hanging tree branch. I looked beyond the branch and buried in the tall grass was a small wooden bridge over the ditch. I went over the bridge and sure enough, there was a trail going up the hill. It was in terrible shape and in drastic need of trail maintenance. I never would have even notice the trail if he hadn't pointed it out. The trail was overgrown with tall grass and briars, both wet with morning dew. After about 20 minutes of scratching my way threw, I decided this couldn't be the trail, and I hadn't seen any white blazes, so I decided to turn around and head back to the road. Just when I turned around, I saw a white blaze on a tree near the trail. I guess it was just in bad need of trail maintenance, so I kept going. Then I remembered reading an article about this section of the trail being re routed in 2014 to get more of it off of private land. In fact my trail book from 2014 said the description of the trail in this area and distances might not be accurate because the trail was moving. I knew immediately that I was hiking on the old trail. I turned around and fought my way through the briars back to the road.   I turned right at the road, hiked for another half mile along the road, and there was a clearly marked trail head with a well-maintained trail. That is why I will probably. It ask directions again for a while. It was nice to be back in the woods again, but after going up and over a small hill, the trail came out to a major highway and a bridge over the New River. It did not look like it does in West Virginia where it is fast moving with white water rapids. It was broad and slow and brown. The bridge was a major road with a walking lane marked off on one side. On the far side of the bridge was a large factory spewing smoke and steam into the morning air. I had learned earlier that it was a factory that made cigarette filters. I had no idea that there were factories just for cigarette filters. And it was huge, with a huge parking lot full of cars. After hiking last the factory, the trail went up and over another small hill. Then the trail crossed a very strange looking stream. The water was somewhere between silver and. milky white. There were signs posted saying that it was not potable water. I remembered reading in the trail book that filtering this water would not remove the toxins that were in it. I am glad they put the signs up, but it seemed glaringly obvious that the water was not safe to drink. I also remembered reading in the description of the new section of trail that this stream was coming from a landfill. I was surprised that EPA regulations allowed this kind of pollution from a land fill. I also thought that this stream is flowing somewhere and at some point these toxins are flowing into the New River. After that, other than multiple power line crossings, the trail became more scenic. About mid morning I saw another hiker coming up from behind me, also hiking North. I slowed down so he would catch up, although the truth is he probably would have caught up anyway. His name was Jeremy, he had just started the trail at Bland, VA, and he is a math teacher from Ohio. We hiked together the rest of the day. I asked him if he had a new trail map because mine was from 2014 and this section of the trail was not accurately described in the book. He said his was from 2013 and now he understood why nothing seemed to be fitting the descriptions from the book since he started this morning. So we hiked on together just following the white blazes. Not long after that, we were hiking parallel to a ridge and we saw a descent sized bear up hill from us. He stopped and turned his head to watch us. He didn't run away, which made us boy a bit nervous. I should ha e taken a picture, but I was focusing more on maintaining a steady pace and moving forward. This was my second bear sighting this trip. I had seen one the day before Pearisburg. I had crossed a powering, where the forest is cleared in a straight line going up and down the mountains. Then I came to another line of cleared forest. I decided it must be a gas ,one, because there were no power lines. As I walked into the clearing, a small bear took off down the hill. When I got to the part of the trail where the bear had been, I saw why he had Ben there - black raspberries. I had been seeing a lot of black berries on the trail, which are a nice treat, but these were black raspberries, which are much sweeter and much tastier. The bear had excellent taste in wild fruit, and he had left some for me, so I stopped and had a snack. This time the bear did not. I've on, so we did.Eventually we came to Rice Field Shelter. The caretaker back at Woods Hole Hostel had told me I had to stay at that shelter. It was a shelter with a view, which is fairly unusual for a shelter. The problem was it was only noon. I didn't usually stop for the day at noon, but Jeremy had checked the weather and there was a storm coming soon and it was 12 miles to the next shelter. There was another hiker already eating lunch at the shelter. She was an English teacher from New York City, and, of course, her trail name was Walden. She decided to try to head to the next shelter. Soon after Walden left, Elisa and Kolby showed up. I though they would be much further up the trail, but they also took a day off in Pearisburg. They decided to hike on about another mile and a half to a campsite. About 29 minutes after they left, the rain started and it rained hard. I am sure they didn't have time to get to the campsite and set up their hammocks set up before the rain. I decided to call it a day and spend some time reading my mystery and writing my journal. The shelter was situated at the edge of the forest facing an open file at the top of a mountain so the views were great. In the center of the field was a sign that showed it was the state line between Virginia and West Virginia. That meant, while instill had hundreds of miles to hike in Virginia, tomorrow, for a short time, I would be hiking in a new state on the AT - West Virginia. At dusk a doe and her phone came up the mountain into the clearing from the West Virginia side. They were unaware of our presence, although we were only about 20 yards away. We watched the for quite a while until they wandered over the mountain down the Virginia side. That was our evening entertainment so we crawled into our sleeping bags and went to sleep at about 9:00.","Pearisburg, VA

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544413,"Jeremy said he likes to head out early. He wasn't kidding. He was up before 6:00 and on the trail before 7:00. I enjoy lying on my sleeping bag listening to the birds for a while before getting up. I rarely hit the trail earlier than 8:30, but I was hoping to to the next shelter, 12 miles away, by lunchtime to avoid the afternoon rain, and then hike on to the next shelter after the rain. It seemed like a great plan. I ate, packed up, and hit the trail by 7:45.The beginning of the day was along the Virginia/West Virginia state line. It started out in a grassy area with no trees. After a mile and a half I hiked into the woods where I saw Elisa's and Kolbe's hammocks hanging between trees. They were not yet up, but it seemed they liked getting up late and hiking later.There was a water source on the opposite side of the trail from their hammocks. I filtered water and filled up both water bottles and headed back to the trail. After about another mile or so the trail exited the forest and entered another grassy field. It was a long, straight descent with an amazing view of two mountains straight ahead. While enjoying the view, I wasn't concentrating on the trail. I hit a patch of wet clay and found myself looking at the view from the ground. My right leg twisted so that my right foot was under me. My first thought was that this would not be a good place to sprain an angle, I took my time getting up. My hand, side, and leg were all muddy. I walked around, checking my ankle and I seemed to be okay so I hiked on down watching the view and the trail.About half an hour later I stopped for a drink of water. I reached around for the pocket of my pack that holds one of the Nalgene bottles, but there was I bottle. I double checked, thinking maybe t slipped further back in the pack. It finally dawned on me that it must have popped out of its pocket when I slipped and fell. I seriously thought about going back for it, even though it was at least 30 minutes up hill. No water was labeled on the map for 12 miles from where I had filtered water earlier. That meant I had one liter of water to last me for about 9 or 10 miles. On the other hand, if I went back, there was a good chance it slipped off onto the grass and I wouldn't find it anyway. I also thought if it was lying on the trail where I fell, Elisa or Kolbe might see it and pick it up. I decided to keep hiking north and ration my water carefully.The trail continued to descend, first in a grassy field and later back in the forest. Then it headed up another mountain and near the top I hiked along a rocky ridge with many rocky outcroppings. The forest dropped away sharply on each side of the trail.Finally I began descending again, heading to the next available water source and the shelter where I planned to eat lunch. I also started to hear thunder in the distance. The closer I got to the water source, the closer the thunder sounded. It stated to sprinkle just as I got to the stream. I knew I had to stop for water, but I was also fairly certain that by the time I finished filtering water, the storm would be here. I filled my one and only Nalgene bottle with water and headed on. The rain grew stronger. The trail paralleled the creek for a while. Soon there were two creeks, the second one was the trail. I hiked from side to side trying to keep my feet dry, but soon decided that was a waste of time and energy. I did have my umbrella to keep my upper body sort of dry, but maneuvering an umbrella through low hanging rhododendrons, also known as ""laurel hells,"" was not an easy task. I made it to the shelter. If I had been 15 minutes sooner, I would have made it to the shelter dry.I sat in the shelter and ate lunch. The rain stopped. The sun came out. There was a bit of clearing right above the shelter; enough so that the picnic table in front of the shelter was in the sun. I took off my hiking shoes and set them on the table in the sun to dry out. It worked. At least they were ""drier."" I took a short bro while my shoes were drying out. I put on a dry pair of socks and almost dry shoes and headed on to the next shelter. I got there about 4:00. Jeremy was already at he shelter. He said he saw three bears early in the morning. I thanked him for clearing them out for me, and decided waiting to head out in the morning might be a good idea. They always say the first person out of camp clears the spiderwebs for everyone else, but maybe there is more to it than that.The shelter was near a wonderful stream, so I washed up and filled my water bottle. When I got back to the shelter, Elisa and Kolbe were just arriving and starting to hang their hammocks. I asked them if they happened to see a green Nalgene bottle. Elisa said they saw one as they were coming down the first mountain. I asked if they picked it up and Kolbe said no because they weren't sure whose it was. I decided I could get by with one water bottle if I planned for it. I ate set up my tent, ate supper, and crawled into bed before 9:00.","Rice Field Shelter

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544645,"We hit the trail in the same order as yesterday. Jeremy hit the trail early, I headed out about 45 minutes later, and Elisa and Kolbe left sometime later. The plan as to go just 14 miles today. My wife was planing to meet me tomorrow so I had to end at a road tomorrow. I was about to enter a trail section with no road crossings for a couple days.As I started out the trail was very rocky. In the book it liked like a fairly easy 14 miles, but when the whole trail is covered with various size rocks it makes for slow hiking. The rocks finally ended and I thought bow glad I was that it ended...but then they would start up again. I passed some great campsites and came to a lookout/outcropping called Wind Rock.The highlight of the day was when I reached the next shelter for lunch. There was a hiker already at the table eating his lunch. He is a 72-year old section hiker from Florida. This is his third or fourth summer of hiking. He waits until school is out because he watches his grandson's dog while his grandson us at school. He then heads to the trail for about 3 or 4 weeks. He takes his time and does about 8 miles a day, but I'll be thrilled if I can hike 8 miles per day for three weeks when I am 72 years old. We sat and talked for about an hour. I got up and headed out and left him slitting there, although he planned to hike another couple miles to a campsite. I think a two-hour lunch break is part of his 8 miles per day plan.I e pelted to see Jeremy when I got to the next shelter. Instead I found a note in the trail book in the shelter. He wished me luck and said he decided to press on to the next shelter. I had told him about a great all-you-can-eat country restaurant coming up, and we saw that it was closed on Monday, so he was going to out in big miles to get there by Sunday. This was going to be my last night on the trail for his section because my wife is picking me up at the next road crossing tomorrow. I located a good tent site near the shelter and cleaned up in Laurel Creek. As I started my supper, Elisa and Kolbe showed up. I met them on my first night of this trip and we had camped near each other at least half the nights. I ate supper and crawled into my tent to read my book while being serenaded by a nearby owl.","Bailey Gap Shelter

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552376,"The weather has been unusually warm, I had meetings in Alexandria, VA, and I skipped 50 miles of the AT between Newport and Daleville, VA, so it only made sense to drive to my meetings in DC and stop for a short November hike on the AT. By the time I drove from Alexandria to Daleville and got a shuttle to Newport Where I ended my hike last summer, the temperature had dropped by 40 degrees, the winds had increased by 30 mph, and it has started to snow. I had packed warm gear, a sleeping bag liner for extra warmth, and I was ready to do this! I only had about two hours of daylight left, so I immediately thought about when and where to stop for the night. I was tempted to stop at the first flat spot and pitch my tent, but surely I could get a few miles in. I hiked through a grassy field, passed Keffer Oak, the second largest oak tree on the AT. It was large, but we had one in our backyard when I was growing up in Indiana that was almost as large – and we never thought about naming it. We just called it the oak tree, but I guess that doesn't work on the AT. It had a great tenting site ext to it, but it was only a mile in. It was cold and windy and there were snow flurries. Part of me felt great to be back on the trail, but in a way it felt a bit unfamiliar with cold gray skies and the feel of winter. About 4:30 I began to wonder if I should have set up camp back by Keffer Oak. There was no flat ground near the trail. Finally I came to a spot where two wooded ridge lines came together and the land flattened out a bit. It also formed a wind tunnel where the 30 mph wind converged to a narrow point and seemed like a nonstop gale force wind. I didn't think I could set up the tent, and I knew I wouldn't get much sleep. The trail crossed over to the other side of the ridge and the mountain blocked the wind. I could still hear it and the tops of the trees swayed frantically, but at ground level there was no wind.I had to go off to the side of the trail about 20 yards to reach level ground. I also had to move a lot of sticks and pull up some small brushy plants before setting up my tent. It took me over thirty minutes to set up my tent, unpack my bag, and hang my food bag between two trees. By that time it was dark. I had brought plenty of hot meals to cook, but I decided to eat a protein bar and climb into a warm sleeping bag. It was 6:00 pm. I woke up many times in the night, sometimes from the howling wind, sometimes from the sound of snow or sleet pelting my tent, and sometimes because I had to get up and pee – not as simple an endeavor as it is in the summer. I wore a couple layers of clothes, I had a liner bag to make my sleeping bag warmer, and I completely zipped up the mummy bag. I had a small opening to breath. I stayed warm except my feet, even with wool socks. I finally put my gloves on my feet and that brought feeling back to my toes so I could comfortably sleep.","VA Rd 42, Newport, VA
",Campsite along the AT,"Nov 19, Sat",4
Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552377,"In the morning, my thermometer said it was 20 degrees, and the wind was still howling. I actually got out of my sleeping bag, changed out of my night clothes to my hiking clothes (a very quick change), and put my gloves on my hands instead of my feet. I had to take off my gloves to untie the food bag and to take down e tent. My fingers and my toes felt numb. I decided to carry a protein bar to eat later and start hiking right away to start warming up. Feeling returned to my fingers and toes as I started tout some miles between me and the campsite. I son passed the turn off to he shelter I had hoped to hike to the first night. It turned out the shelter was 3/10’s of a mile off the trail; that is seldom a good idea. The wind kept up all day. There were great views. Because the trees up on the mountains were completely leafless, but I didn't stop and take in the views much because of the the gray skies and the wind. The wind provided the day’s biggest challenge. It was relentless. Periodically the trail would lead me to a more protected side of the mountain, but for most of the day the wind blew strong.About 1:00 I came to the second shelter. It was right on the trail. There was a nice tenting area near the shelter. There was actually a rather large tent set up near the shelter with no sign of a hiker. The only thing I could think of is that it was set up for a trail maintenance crew who wasn't there yet.    I had seen that once before at a different spot on the trail. I took off my pack, laid it on the picnic table, and headed to the privy. As I sat in the privy the wind continued to howl. I heard the unmistakable sound of a tree coming down in the woods. It sounded very close. The thought flashed through my mind, “What if I die sitting on the toilet in the middle of this forest?” I guess there are worse ways to die, but I wasn't ready to go yet, and how long would it be before someone found me? I heard the tree come crashing down with a roar, and I was still Live on the toilet. I opened the door to see where it fell. The wind caught the door and banged it against the side of the privy. Now I was sitting in the toilet with the door wide open and I couldn't reach it to pull it closed without getting up off of the toilet. It didn't seem to matter since I was alone in the woods so first I looked for the tree. It was downhill about fifty feet from the privy. I could see that my pack was still safe on the picnic table. I finished my task and explored the area around the shelter. I decided, although there were about three hours of hiking light left, I would spend the afternoon here, enjoy the nice surroundings, and just make it a seven mile day. I walked around a bit and located a great tenting spot on a soft bed of moss. It was about 20 feet from the deserted tent. It would be a great spot to spend the night. I went back to the picnic table and read the shelter log while I ate lunch. I also kept trying to reposition myself to minimize the impact of the wind. The most recent entry was dated today, from a SOBO (southbound hiker). It seemed very strange, because I was hiking north and I hadn't met another hiker all morning. As I ate, I realized that staying here in the wind would not make for a very relaxing afternoon, so I might as well keep hiking. I finished my lunch of cheese and flatbread, packed up my stuff and headed back up the trail. As I walk passed the deserted tent again, heading back to the trail, a dog started barking from inside the tent. His human companion calmed him down, stuck his head out the doorway, and said, “How's it going?” The entire time I had been wandering passed the tent, eating my lunch, and observing a tree come crashing down about 50 feet away there was no noise or movement from the tent. Maybe they are both really heavy sleepers. Maybe they were huddled into the tent to stay out of the wind.I checked out the weather forecast on the weather app from the top of a mountain where I got enough cell signal to use my phone. I was curious how cold it was supposed to get and when the wind would stop. It said the low would be 25 degrees. That is down the mountain in the nearest little town. And it said the wind advisory was in effect until 7:00 pm. About 4:00 I began watching for a good tent site. By 4:30 I found a nice spot with a cleared, flat tent site and a nearby area with a fire ring formed by loose stones in a circle with a nearby rock for a seat. It was like a 4-star campsite on the AT scale. It was wooded but open with no undergrowth. That meant the wind was whipping through at about 30-35 mph. I decided to set up camp before dark, crawl into my sleeping bag and then get up at 7:30 to cook supper after the wind had died down. I hung my food bag away from the tent area and then tried to set up my tent. The challenge was laying down the ground cloth and setting up the tent without having it blow away. I pointed the narrow end of the tent into the wind. That helped a bit, but it was like raising a sail during a hurricane…well, I have never raised a sail, and I have never been in a hurricane, but it was a significant challenge, and one that had to be completed with bare hands to get all of the pole tips into the grommets. I finally got the tent set up, with the rainfall and crawled into my cold sleeping bag, which soon be came toasty warm from my body heat. By 7:30 the wind was as strong as ever. In fact it blew all night long. I was warm in the tent, but the wind woke me up over and over again. It sounded like trying to sleep along an airport runway. The leaves were all gone from the trees, but the wind still created an enormous sound and it blue the leaves along the ground, smacking them into the walls of my tent. Again I had thoughts of being found crushed under a fallen tree. I thought I really should get out my pen and tablet and write a last note to my loved ones and to whoever would find my crushed body, but there was no way I was taking my hands out of the warm sleeping bag into the bitter cold air. So I went back to sleep. This time I wrapped my feet in my down jacket, so even they stayed warm all night.","

Over Hill Over Dale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552378,"My thermometer said 17 degrees. During the night I dreamt about getting up and fixing a hot cocoa and having my hot supper that I missed last night. Black beans and rice makes for a strange breakfast, but it would warm me up inside. When the reality of the morning hit, I knew it was too cold to sit around eating a meal. And my water was frozen solid, making it useless for cooking…or drinking. As I packed up, the cold numbed my toes and fingers. I grabbed a protein bar and an apple out of my food bag and hit the trail. The apple provided me with my only water until I came to a stream. It was very crispy because it was semi-frozen. As I hiked, my toes thawed out and soon I needed to stop to take off some layers because I was too warm. Following the trail became a major challenge because it was often buried under 1 or 2 feet of leaves. Sometimes on the trail I hike for a quarter mile or more without seeing a white blaze, but in this section the blazes seemed to be about 30 yards apart. I appreciated there frequency because it was often the only way to see where the trail headed. I spent a good part of the day wandering in the woods heading from one white blaze to another not knowing if I was actually walking on the trail or not. When hiking the trail you send a good part of your time and attention looking down to watch for rocks and roots. With the trail under a pile of leaves, all of those rocks and roots were hidden from sight. I shuffled through the leaves feeling for obstructions with my feet. Whenever I headed downhill, slipping on the leaves was became an issue. I fell several times. The one consolation was that when I fell, the piles of leaves made for a soft landing. Soon after stopping for a food break, I turned to follow what I thought was the trail, but was actually a small dry creek bed.   I shuffled through the leaves and found a cold pool of water under the leaves. I first noticed it when I felt the cold water coming into my shoe. I knew I needed to do something soon or I was in danger of frostbite. I stopped and took off my wet shoe and sock. The warmth quickly left my toes. I dug a dry sock out of my pack, but my shoe was also wet. I usually carry old, light weight running shoes to use as “camp shoes.” I had thought about not varying them this time because I knew with the short days I wasn't going to spend a lot of time hanging around camp. As it turned out, the extra shoes were a life saver. I put on a dry sock and a dry shoe. My shoes didn't match, but my feet were dry, so I strapped the wet shoe to my pack, put the wet sock in a side pocket of my pack, and hiked on. Later I pulled it out of the pocket, and the wet sock was frozen solid. I was very glad it was no longer on my foot.The high point of the day in altitude and scenery was the dragon’s tooth. It provided great views from a rocky precipice. It must be a popular day hike destination. Prior to reaching the Dragon’s Tooth I met enough hikers to count on one hand over the last two days. Coming down from the Dragon’s Tooth there were many hikers in small groups and not-so-small groups heading up and down the mountain. The trail was as challenging as any part I had been on the AT. Some of it required climbing along a rock ledge using hands and feet. Some parts had steel rods driven into the rocks to provide steps for climbing up or down the rocks. I was about twenty-four miles along the trail from my car – two days of hiking. Between the cold, my pain from the plantar fasciitis,, and needing to get back to Indiana, I made the decision to look for a ride back to my car and head back to Indiana. I would save the next 24 miles, including McAfee Knob for another day, hopefully a warmer day. On the way down from the Dragon’s tooth I hiked with a retired Presbyterian minister from Lynchburg, VA. We had a great conversation and when we got to the parking lot, he and his wife offered to give me a ride back to my car. It turned out to be only nine miles by road and was on their way back to Lynchburg. So what would have taken me two days by the trail, took us about 15 minutes by car. Another AT adventure had come to an end. It was the first time my hiking focused on survival. I wouldn't say it was a “fun” hike, but it was exhilarating. I think the cold by itself wouldn't have been bad, but temperatures in the teens with 30 or more mile per hour winds definitely turned a hike in the woods into a lesson on survival. Would I do it again? You bet! I might bring some warmer socks for sleeping in, and I might think about Gortex hiking shoes, but, while my wet sock stayed frozen, my light-weight, non-Gortex shoes dried out.People often ask me if I hike alone when I do a section hike of the AT. I am never quite sure how to answer. Yes, I hike alone, but I could never do it on my own. I usually get a ride to or from the trail. I get encouragement and other kinds of hep from other hikers. This time I got a ride back to my car from people I had never met, and it saved me two days of hiking. I have had to hitchhike into a town on several occasions, and while we are always warned not to pick up hitchhikers, someone always ignores those safety warnings and picks me up. Also, in terms of support, I wouldn’t be hiking the AT at all without the support of my wife, who lets us plan vacations around getting to and from the AT. So I think my answer to the question, “Do you hike alone?” is “I hike solo with lots of supports from my family, from my old friends, and from new friends.” In fact, that is just another way gat hiking the AT is like life away from the trail. Most worthwhile things that we accomplish in life require a lot of hard work on out part, but we still couldn't accomplish it without the help of those who went before us and those who walk along side of us offering help and encouragement.","
