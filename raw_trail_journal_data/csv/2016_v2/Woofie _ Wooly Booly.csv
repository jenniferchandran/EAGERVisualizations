Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521090,"It’s been eight months since we finished our hike last year in Erwin, TN. So that’s where we’re starting this year on our continued northward trek. We’re aiming to start around April 20. Starting about a month earlier than last year should give us a couple months on the trail before it gets too hot for us.And we’re trying something different this year. We’re adding a new piece of gear: our car. Each time we stop at a town or hostel, we plan to drive it a few days’ hike north to the next stopping point and get shuttled back south again. So, we’ll always be hiking back to our car. The reason: we’re taking our whole hike’s worth of trail food and gear with us in the car. So by keeping our surplus gear and supplies in the car, we won’t have to carry town clothes on the trail, rely on mail drops for supplies, or mail any gear home as we transition from cold-weather to warm-weather gear. And not having to rent a car to get from home to the trail and back again will save a lot of money, too.We had a terrific hike last year, and we hope this year is even better.",,New Year - New Plan,"Feb 13, Sat",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521302,"Over the winter months I’ve been walking at least two miles every morning before breakfast, usually in weather much colder than I expect during my hike. But I’ve been wearing just the items that I plan to have with me on the hike, and I’m pleased to report with confidence that I will not be too cold in them.One item I added for very cold or wet conditions was a pair of gaiters. They protect my calves and ankles, acting as a wind breaker in cold windy weather and a rain guard in wet weather. I found that my shoes (and feet) stay warm and dry because no water can run down my legs into my socks, when walking through wet places. I did find, however, that my pant legs above my knees and below my rain jacket get wet in the rain. So I made myself a water-proof kilt to keep that part of my legs dry. Getting wet while hiking is pretty much unavoidable at times, but staying as dry as possible in cold weather is necessary to avoid hypothermia.I got the idea from the Trail Journals hiker Jan Liteshoe, class of ’03, who used a plastic trash bag as a rain skirt during one of the wettest hiking seasons on record. I used a heavy-duty trash bag and reinforced all the edges with duct tape. Then I just wrap it around my waist and fasten it with a couple document binder clips at the waist. It covers just my upper legs, keeping my pants or shorts dry, but still providing good ventilation and freedom of movement. I made one for Woofie, too.",,Adding New Equipment,"Feb 17, Wed",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521833,"The Appalachian Trail is a special place, a place where every year a new group of people begin their hike as strangers and become a community of friends. Woofie & I have met and made lots of friends along the way. Most of them disappear into the woods forever after only two or three chance encounters. Tiptoe, Sandy of PA, Iris & Again were some of those. But we still think of them often and hope they’re doing fine. Others became our trail angels, and we’ve stayed in contact with them.Becky (Surefoot ’92) contacted us during our first hike in 2014 through Trail Journals. She shuttled us around and joined us for meals in Franklin, NC and the NOC. And we’ve stayed in touch since then, hoping to hike back into range of her current employment location. If we get far enough north into VA, she might join us again.Then last year we were hiking the approach to New Found Gap, wondering how we could get to Gatlinburg, when we met Keith (Buckshot ’16) doing a training hike in preparation for his thru-hike this year. Since he was hiking only as far as New Found Gap, where his truck was waiting, he gave us a ride to Gatlinburg. He’s starting his hike from Springer Mountain, GA, about a month earlier than we are this year, so he might catch up to us somewhere north of Erwin, TN. This time we can give him a ride.And thanks to Trail Journals, not only new friends but also old friends can join me on the trail, at least in spirit. Jim and Paul were my best friends in HS. We were as close as any three musketeers could be. But thanks to college, military service, and disparate careers, we lost touch until the last few months. Now almost 50 years later, thanks to Trail Journals and the TJ Guest Book, we are back together again. I'm so thrilled that they can follow me and Woofie as TJ readers as we hike along. And then in August we all plan to be reunited for the first time, and I can tell them in person about our wonderful experiences on the trail.",,Friends on the Trail,"Feb 25, Thu",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523287,"With a little over a month to go before we start off on the third leg of our adventure, we still have a couple things to take care of.Since we’ll be using our car as a mobile storage unit as we travel from town to town, we’re stocking up on the foods we like but are sometimes either hard to find or very expensive. We’ve already amassed enough Clif Bars in our favorite flavors to last a couple months on the trail. The other primary food item for our evening meals is Mountain House freeze dried meals. We’ve been finding them harder and harder to find, even in Walmart and especially in small towns without an outfitter. So, we’re going to place a large order for the whole trip. That way we’re also guaranteed to have a wide selection that only includes the meals we like.Everything else in the food category is just snack food that is available in any store that sells food. That gives us some variety during the day: things like cookies, crackers, nuts, raisins, chips, and candy. M&Ms are my favorite. I call them my power pills.Woofie has to take care of the other thing herself. During her annual dental checkup, she found out that she needs to have a back molar removed. It might turn into a painful emergency on the trail if she doesn’t. So she’ll get that done in early April. And that’s why we’re starting a few days later than the 15th of April that we’d hoped. She needs to know she’s recovered from that before we take off for the wilderness. And at least one benefit will be less weight for her to carry. Convincing her to take less stuff on the trail has been as hard as pulling teeth, literally.",,Hard Choices,"Mar 12, Sat",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523990,"Having grown up in the foot hills of the Catskills of upstate NY, I’ve always loved being outdoors and walking in the woods. It was about 30 years ago that I chose the goal for myself of hiking the Appalachian Trail one day.Not long after that I noticed that my knees began to complain at times. But I continued being active – riding bicycles, hiking Billy Goat trails, and playing tennis. In 2001 I began jogging and logged over 500 miles that year and the next. But as the years passed by, the arthritis in my knees got steadily worse, and I had to stop jogging.On my good days I could still hike or ride a bike, and one day in 2007, I did a 100-mile bike ride. Not bad for a 60-year old grandmother. But by the following year my left knee would scream even during a walk in the back yard. I had to do something about that.In Feb 2008 I had a full knee replacement on my left leg. I spent three days in the hospital, two weeks with in-home therapy, and four more weeks doing out-patient therapy three times a week. It was hard and painful work, but as my incision healed and my flexibility returned, the pain faded away. That summer I played tennis and could ride my bike again pain free. Three years later I had to have the right knee replaced, also. It took longer to recover this time because I had suffered paralysis on my right side from polio as a child. Since my right leg was weaker to start with, it took longer for it to respond to the therapy. But it was worth the trouble. My new knees are perfectly pain free and I don’t even think of them anymore. They are just part of me. In fact, when I had a bout of Lyme’s disease a couple summers ago, all of my joints hurt, even my fingers and toes – everything but my knees. For my first AT section hike two years ago, I was a bit apprehensive about my knees. I was afraid I might fall and damage them. I did fall a few times, as everyone does, and they were fine. So last year on my second section, I enjoyed it much more. And although I did have sore feet at times, my knees never hurt me at all.Today is my birthday. I am 69 years old today. One month from today we leave to begin our third AT section. I’m so lucky to be hiking.",,Woofie: I’m Lucky to Be Hiking,"Mar 19, Sat",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524915,"We still have about three weeks to go before leaving for our third AT section. We’ve got all our gear and all the food supplies that we’ll need for this year’s adventure.Twice before, we set out expecting to be on the trail for about three months, and both times we ran into obstacles that stopped us after about a month. It seemed a shame to stop after a month just when our strengthened mountain legs had arrived. So this time we’re going to attempt a more modest two month hike and try to avoid the pitfalls of the past.To avoid the lack of supplies pitfall of the first season, we’re taking everything we’ll need for the whole hike with us in our car. Last year we mailed food boxes ahead, which worked well enough, but it was a lot of work and added considerable expense to the food we’d bought. The problem with mail drops is not knowing what and how much we’d need when we’d get them. Beside the expense of buying and mailing food ahead, it’s frustrating to not need it all when you get it. This year we’ll be able to pack just what we’ll need for the next few days and leave the rest in the car for later.To avoid the summer heat pitfall of last season, we’re starting a full month earlier in the season. If we can stay on the trail until mid/late June like we did last year, two months should be doable. The stamina built during the first month of hiking should make the second month easier and more enjoyable.And finally, looking ahead at this year’s trail, another pitfall to avoid is running out of water. Last year we never ran out of water, but we did get low a couple times. Worrying about running out of water made us not drink as much as we wanted to sometimes and then too much when we got to a water source. That’s what happened at the spring in the photo. So this year we’re adding 2-liter water bladders to our backpacks in addition to the water bottles we usually carry. That way we’ll not only be able to carry more water, but also be able to drink as we walk without having to stop, staying better hydrated.",,Covering All the Bases,"Mar 26, Sat",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526219,"We finally finished accumulating all of the food for the two months of hiking. Collecting it all was harder than we thought it would be.Mountain House meals have been harder to find in stores lately. Stores like Walmart have stopped stocking them, and even sporting goods stores only have limited but expensive choices. So we ordered everything from Amazon.com. It was the easiest and the cheapest option.Getting a two-month supply of Clif Bars actually took us more than a couple months. Although they’re available in grocery stores, convenience stores, sporting goods stores, and Walmart, the flavor selections and quantities available were usually quite small, so we had to pick them up a few at a time. We also avoided convenience stores and sporting goods stores because they charge about twice as much as Walmart or grocery stores. So, we’re pretty much ready. We just have to take care of all the other details that have nothing to do with hiking. Sixteen days and counting down.",,Got It All,"Apr 03, Sun",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528613,"Tomorrow we leave home, heading back to Erwin, TN. We’ll stay at the Super 8 Motel there overnight and enjoy a final breakfast at the Huddle House next door before driving to Uncle Johnny’s Hostel Wednesday morning. We’ll leave the car there and he’ll shuttle us north about 20 miles. Then we’ll hike back to Erwin and the car.We finally got all the things that needed doing done, so now we can just load the car and take off tomorrow morning. First surprise! All that food (two months’ worth) takes up more space in the Prius than we figured, so we’re taking the Dodge minivan instead. Second surprise! Woofie figured out that having the bigger car doesn’t just make her pack lighter between town stops, it lets her fill up the car with more town clothes. I was hoping that the smaller car would keep that from happening.",,"Finally, No More Waiting","Apr 18, Mon",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529279,"After an 8-hour drive yesterday we checked into the Super 8 motel and had a good meal at Huddle House. We got up early this morning and drove to Uncle Johnny's to park our car and get shuttled up the trail about 20 miles. Charlotte, Mrs UJ, dropped us off at the trail head and we got started back to Erwin by 9:40. It was a beautiful morning at 65 degrees and with a nice breeze. We made it to the Cherry Gap shelter, three miles in, in two hours and stopped there for lunch. It got into the mid 80s by the time we got back on the trail, but as we climbed Unaka Mountain, the temps dropped back to the mid 70s as we gained elevation. We made it to the top by 3:00 and stopped for a snack. At 3:30 we start down the other side of the mountain toward Deep Gap, where we planned to camp for the night, just two miles from the top. We were making good time and with just half a mile to go, we thought we'd get there by 5 pm. That's when Woofie fell and hurt her knee. We made it to camp by 5:30. Both her knee and wrist are stiff and painful, so we'll have to see how they are in the morning. We may have to call for a shuttle back to Erwin, where we can rest a couple days before deciding what to do next.","Iron Mountain Gap

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529434,"When we woke up, Woofie’s knee and wrist had swollen and become more painful. With both injuries being on the left side, she was almost totally immobilized, making simply getting out of the tent extremely difficult. We knew that our hike was over, and that we had to get off the trail and get medical attention.Fortunately, we had a cell phone signal and our campsite was right on a forest service road. So we called Uncle Johnny’s and arranged for someone to come collect us. And luckily, his shuttle driver was standing in the room with Uncle Johnny when my call came in. He said “I’ll be there in 30 minutes.” That was great news…and not so great news. We had never been able to get packed up in less than an hour before, and that was with both of us working together. It took over 5 minutes just to get Woofie out of the tent, because she couldn’t crawl without the use of her hands and knees. Somehow, I managed to get everything rolled up, picked up, and packed into the backpacks, as well as the tent taken down and put back into its bag, just as Tom the shuttle driver (former AT hiker, trail name - 10-K) showed up. While he was loading our tent and backpacks into the truck, I took down the bear bag with all our food in it from the nearby tree where it hung over night and put it into the truck. Together, Tom and I helped Woofie get into the truck, and only 5 minutes after he arrived, we were on our way back to Uncle Johnny’s, where our car was waiting. An hour after we made our distress call, we were back at our car. A huge thank you goes to Uncle Johnny, his wife Charlotte, to Tom our shuttle driver for our rapid rescue. On our way back to the hostel, Tom told us about the medical care options in the area. He said that the urgent care provider in Erwin didn’t have X-Ray capability, and would have to refer us to an orthopedic practice in Johnson City 30 miles away. But after calling our own primary care provider to check on our options with regards to our health insurance plan, we decided to drive home first and go to our own urgent care, which can take X-rays.Seven and a half hours later we arrived at our own urgent care provider and were seen immediately. X-rays showed no broken bones, so that was good. She just has bruising and swelling, so she’ll be in leg and wrist splints for a while. And even though the urgent care X-rays didn’t show anything wrong with her knees, we also made an appointment on Monday with the orthopedic surgeon who performed her knee replacements to ensure that her implants are undamaged.So our two-month hike didn’t go as planned, lasting just one day. But what a terrific day it was for almost all of it. Woofie is already thinking about returning, maybe even in the fall. The fall (or should I say autumn, instead) is even more beautiful.","Deep Gap

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529986,"Yesterday Woofie had her appointment with the orthopedist. Although none of the hardware in her knee implant was damaged in her fall, she did suffer a hairline fracture of the patella (knee cap). She’ll have to keep the leg brace on for another 4-6 weeks. Too much leg bending before it heals could cause stress on the knee cap and slow the healing process. So, all she needs is rest and regular progress check-ups with the orthopedist to make a full recovery. Getting off the trail and heading home immediately was the right thing to do. Another major good decision on this trip was taking our own car. Although our intention was just to use it as mobile storage for our food and excess supplies as we hiked, it turned out to be our life boat. It not only got us home in time for same-day medical attention, but also saved us over $1200 by avoiding the cost of car rentals in both directions for what turned out to be a record short hike. We hope to continue the hike and this journal later this year in the autumn. But for now, we’re waiting again. The trail will still be there.","

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536523,"After six weeks of rest and recovery, Woofie had her final orthopedic exam this week. The physical exam and X-rays showed that her knee has completely healed. She can now begin low-impact physical activities like cycling and road walking to rebuild her lost strength.As it turned out, the six weeks we spent at home instead of on the trail were almost entirely rainy days. So, if we had to miss a season of hiking, better that it was this one than one with nice weather. We plan to return to the trail where we left off, but still don’t know when. Maybe in the autumn, but definitely next spring. The trail will still be there.",,Recovery Complete,"Jun 04, Sat",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549230,"Falling face first while going downhill on the trail is a traumatic experience. But the extent of the trauma isn’t always immediately apparent. Woofie’s first thought after the face-plant tumble she took was to check her jaw and teeth, because her jaw landed on a rock and left a bloody bruise on her chin. After finding that her jaw still worked and no teeth were missing, she surveyed the damage to her knee, which was also bleeding. It wasn’t long before the shock of the fall wore off and the pain from her damaged knee and wrist set in. And we had to leave the trail while she healed.Six weeks of rest and therapy later, she thought she had recovered fully. Although July was very hot, she continued her normal outdoor activities at home while regaining her strength and mobility. Then in the beginning of August, she felt there was another problem developing. She started having tooth aches. A quick emergency trip to the dentist confirmed she had an abscess under two teeth that would require both to undergo root canal procedures.It turns out that the impact of her face plant had traumatized some of her teeth, after all, killing the nerves in the roots. The dentist said that it would normally take about 10 weeks for an injury like hers to manifest itself as it had. So her recovery from the fall was still not complete.It took three more dental appointments spread over six weeks, including two separate rounds of antibiotics and root canal procedures and then the final fillings, to repair the damage she suffered in a split second at the end of her first day of hiking. This time, we’re pretty sure, she’s fully recovered.As result of her setback, a return to the trail this autumn is no longer an option. But her determination to carry on next spring is even stronger. So, we’re waiting again. The trail will still be there, and so will we.",,Recovery Complete – Or So We Thought,"Sep 22, Thu",0
