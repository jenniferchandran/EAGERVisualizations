That's all behind us as we look forward to starting our hike. We are 2 ordinary people in our early 50's - I have grade 3 out of 4 arthritis in both knees and GH has chronic plantar fasciitis (a nurse and on her feet all day) I received synvisc injections and GH had cortisone injections. We have not physically prepared due to job and life issues over the past 2 months and will be careful to not go ""too far, too fast, too soon"".This might be our longest post because we like to enjoy the trail, the comarade of fellow hikers, and just some alone time, but I will do my best to post a short daily blog with a pic. I also plan to post YouTube videos when we get to a town. Keep in mind that only 10-20% of the people who start the AT finish. We will have down days and appreciate your words of encouragement on our Guest book. I hope you enjoy reading about our adventure.

We had to walk up .7 mile up a very steep road (it was the toughest climb of the day ??). We are taking it slow for the first couple of days. We met some nice people already: 2 women Bunkie and Trotter, Crowe an older 72 year old gentleman from IN, Zac who looks like Zac from Hangover who tried a thru hike in 2013 but quit in VT and has regretted it, a guy called ""11.30"" because he only hiked until 11.30 for the first couple days. We made it to Muskrat shelter and called it a day. While we were eating dinner a young girl was changing clothes and was topless 20 yards away in open view. She really didn't mind because she walked to the shelter in her underwear and jog bra. Gotta love the AT! We were in bed by 5.30pm to rest our legs and get some sleep??. Staying at a shelter is not for us. There must have been 20 people there in: in the shelter, tents and hammocks. We must be getting old because young people are so loud.

Note to self - hang dirty clothes under the hammock. It took awhile to cook breakfast, tear down and get on our way. We didn't leave until 9.20am. We were surprised to get our first trail magic down the trail at 11.30 am at Deep Gap: pancakes, sausage, cheeseburgers, salad, chips, soda, beer and coffee. Our hosts (Fivel and Little Foot) hiked the trail on 2014 and decided to come up from Atlanta and give trail magic.

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526412,"What a frightening night we had with terrible wind storm. We decided to pitch our hammocks at the bottom of Standing Indian Mountain in a valley called Beech Gap. We could hear the roar of the wind coming from on top of the mountain down to us and it pushed our tarps so hard into our hammocks we started to swing. Then the mountain on the other side started to roar and wind came down and pushed the other side of our tarps. It was 2 mountains dueling it out to see who could blow harder. It blew so hard that leaves came in under the tarp and filled our hammocks. I was worried a tent stake would pull out, a line would break, or a limb would fall and rip a hammock or cause us harm. To add to the misery, the temperature dropped and we were freezing. With only a couple hours sleep right before daybreak, we were so cold we jumped out of our hammocks, packed up and started hiking to get warm. We spoke to a lot of hikers who had the same experience as us. We met a lot of hikers today: Wolf Legs, Blueberry, Bilbo, Campbell who is out on a section hike with his girlfriend's black lab named Jackson, Pineapple Express, Kaleidoscope, someone from Germany without a trail name, and Burly. There have been few lookout views so when we finally found one it was spectacular and brought GH to tears. Toughest part of the day was the climb up Albert Mountain (5,052 elev.) - the last .3 of a mile was a straight up rock scramble. The view from the fire on tower on top made it all worthwhile. We ended up at the shelter with Campbell, his dog Jackson, and Burly and had a nice chat around a campfire, a perfect end to a great day.Heading into Franklin, NC tomorrow.FT","Beech Gap tenting area

We have not met another couple our age or another woman GH's age. 4 - surprisingly, 50% of the hikers smoke. The ones with money buy cigarettes and the others hand roll them. No drugs other than 1 joint so far. 5 - GH is mothering the young girls who are having break downs. She has already hugged a couple of girls who were in tears and she gives them words of encouragement. 6 - This hard! The body transformation into hiker who can carry a pack up and down mountains for 10-15 miles is rough, but it is coming. 7 - Critter report: we have heard owls, seen a few birds, squirrels, and our first Black Bear today.

I started hiking at 11.30 and it was hot. I did a poor job of planning my water over the 7 miles to the next shelter and soon ran out with 2 miles to go. I sat in the shelter and drank a liter of water with Mio to replace electrolytes. Other hikers said the trail passes through Atkins, VA in 4 miles and there is a Mexican restaurant on the trail. They Alison talked about someone called Mayo who is carrying a guitar. GH and I hiked with Mayo and his friends Cory and Logic. Finally someone I know to hike and hang out with. I jumped up and do my fast shuttle step over the next 4 miles in hopes of catching them. I did catch them at a gas station in Atkins. We all agreed to hike 2 more miles to a camp site. Mayo brought his guitar to the fire and played for 1.5 hours straight. He is a good player and singer and it brought tears to my eyes thinking how much GH would have loved sitting around a fire listening to him play and sing.

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535245,"I planned on doing big miles today to make it to the Bland PO by Saturday to pick up my package but things change. It was very humid when I stared and I was immediately dripping sweat up the first hill. I tried to drink often because I was already partially dehydrated from the day before. When I made it to the first stream I filled up and drank a whole bottle with Mio. I made it over the next hill and had lunch at the bottom before the trail went out into a cow pasture. I was not hungry but ate a couple of sandwiches and got going again. The trail went through a couple miles of hay fields and finally went back in the woods. I wasn't thirsty but made myself drink. On the way up the next hill I heard a loud hissing noise and jumped back to assess. It was a large rattlesnake partially on the trail!!!! He stopped rattling and just laid there. He finally started moving so I snuck past him and threw a stick at him to keep moving. Bad idea. He turned around, started rattling again and was headed back towards me so I booked it down the trail. Shortly after that I hit the quarter way mark of the AT - only 1,642 miles more to the end. By 2:30 I was dragging and went through all the possibilities in my mind: dehydrated; giardia; hay fever; food poisoning; flu from being in Marion; or just tired. I saw someone had set up a blue awning on the trail ahead and was hoping for trail magic but no one was there. I kept going on the trail and heard my name - it was Wall Flower who we use to hike with. The awning was Scratch's (a former thru hiker and Ducky's dad) who had gone into town to resupply. I told Scratch my dilemma about the Bland PO and he said he goes into Bland everyday and would take me in tomorrow. Yea!! Then the day got better - the parents of a hiker drove in from Cincinnati and was setting up to cook. 2 hamburgers, a hotdog, salad, and 2 beers made me feel a whole lot better. The magic of the trail - I was struggling, worried about picking up my package and now I feel better and have a ride to the PO tomorrow. What will tomorrow bring?","Davis hollow tent site

After we made it back to the trail, they fired up the grill and I ate a couple of 'dogs before I left at 1pm. It was a very humid day - I go slow up the hills and pick up my pace on the way down. The last 4.5 miles was a 2k ft climb.   I like finishing the day between 6-7pm; it is usually cooler, you have a better chance of seeing critters, and it reminds me of taking walks growing up in W.

I met Bearwall and Salsa yesterday. Salsa is a young lady from DC. She has a bad case of poison ivy/oak. We camped beside each other and had a good conversation over dinner. She left before I did this morning but I eventually caught up to her. I also passed 4 other hikers over the next 6 miles. We came to a road crossing and Danger's dad was passing out water bottles and apples. It was a little after 12 so I decided to eat my lunch. One by one, all the hikers I had seen came in, except for Salsa. The other hikers said they all passed her sitting on a rock. We were growing concerned and thought about going up to find her when she finally arrived 15 minutes later. She looked terrible, had sick eyes, and needed to see a doctor and get some rest. Fortunately, Dangers dad gave her a ride to a main road so she could hitch to a town for medical care. Point of the story - hikers look out for each other on the AT. We made camp 7 miles outside of Bland. There are 10 other hikers here and I am the oldest, seems to be the norm lately. Most of the hikers are my kids age, but I feel good knowing that I can keep up with them in miles (just not as fast).

I was taking it easy and let 3 young hikers pass me. I tried a new cross country ski technique and started pushing off my poles. It felt good, made me more efficient and faster up hill. So I turned up the gas and one by one slowly caught up to and passed each of those hikers on a long uphill. They are all very strong hikers and each one could have been my kid. I wonder what they thought when an old man with a white beard came back to pass them uphill - ""here comes FullThrottle"".

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536154,"Happy Memorial Day to everyone! I didn't sleep much at the pavilion last night. A bunch of hikers smoked a lot of weed at the pavilion and had the giggles until after 11pm (that's really late for hikers). I packed up the next morning, bought some last minute things at the grocery and stood for 30 minutes hitching before I was picked up. The trail started uphill and it was hot and humid and I was dripping (so much for a shower). I skipped the first shelter because it was .3 (that's .6 round trip) off the trail. Most hikers would rather hike .6 down the trail instead of a round trip visit to a shelter. The next shelter was 9.6 miles away and there was a road crossing at 6.6 miles. I finished my water before the next road crossing hoping there would be trail magic but there was no one there. With 3 miles to water I was in survival mode and tried not to sweat.   It was a long, slow 3 miles and I went straight to the creek when I arrived at the shelter. I drank 2 20 oz bottles of water mixed with Gatorade. It was still hot and I was tired so I laid in the shelter with my head on my pack and my took my sandals off. It started to rain and I took a short nap before other hikers came in. My peace and quiet was gone as the picnic table filled up with 6 hikers who all needed water as well. It was 4.30pm and they all started eating their lunches/dinners. At 5pm I needed so some alone time and decided to move on to the next camp site in 1 miles. It was wet, humid and buggy so I decided to push to the next water source that was up and over the next mountain. I arrived after 8pm and thankfully it was still light a lite after 8 when I arrived. Not bad considering I did the last 6.8 miles after 5pm. Now that I'm on my own, I'm a ""newbie"" hiker and have not explored my potential - is a 20 mile day or maybe a 25 mile day a possibility?

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536149,"I woke up and packed up camp first thing and walked to at Trent's grocery for a breakfast platter and coffee (additional 1 mile round trip). I started hiking up the hill when I took a detour down to Dismall falls (additional.6 miles round trip). Apparently this is a popular spot to hang out and swim for hikers and they were camped everywhere. I needed a good dip after all the sweating and stripped down to my boxers and jumped in. It was so refreshing, even at 10am. The trail followed the creek for a couple of miles and was level. I took it easy to try not to sweat since I am dehydrated. Around 3pm I pass a shelter and trail starts going straight up - 1,300 ft climb in a mile. There were no switchbacks, this trail went straight up. It reminded me of hills I used to climb on my dirt bike as a teenager. This hill kicked my butt! I was exhausted. Now my Achilles hurt from climbing, then here come the rocks. My feet were screaming and I crawled into the Woods Hole hostel (.5 miles off trail). My plan was to get a shower, have them do my laundry and a cooked dinner. Everything was good - the shower was clean, a homemade dinner of salad, bread, and burritos (all you could eat), and my laundry was done after dinner. Laying here in the 5 ft long top bunk reminded me (again) of why I don't sleep in hostels - there are spider nests above me and between the mattress and the wall. How am I going to sleep tonight? Look on the bright side, I could be in my hammock in the rain tonight (I would take it over spiders). Oh well, 11 more miles into a town tomorrow.

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536159,"Wow, I have been on the trail for 2 months now. Now that GH is gone, I have a lot of alone time with my thoughts. Hiking is very basic and you have 3 main concerns - food, shelter, and water. There are no other distractions that you non-hikers deal with like the news, current events, the election, sports scores, job issues or other daily grind ""things"" that tend to bog you down. Once your hiking concerns are settled in your thoughts, there is room for other things to bubble up - emotions. I have noticed I am quickly moved to tears with the thought of seeing my wife, my kids, extended family, the words from a song, touching that finish sign in Maine and other beautiful things. In my non-hiking life my thoughts are weighed down from all the daily grind stuff. Now I am moved to tears by thoughts of joy, sadness, and reflecting on past experiences in my life. The frequent non-hiker emotions of anger, anxiousness, and impatience are still there but have moved way down and are insignificant. I firmly believe that any time walking/hiking or sitting in nature is therapeutic and I highly recommended you make time and get out in the woods.

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536521,"I thought about it and I'm going to embrace my hippie thoughts. I stayed in Pearisburg last night and called some former co-workers. It was refreshing and uplifting to hear their offers of support and invitations to come out and hike with me the farther North I make it. I got started at 9.30am and the Holiday Motor inn was kind enough to give me a ride 1 mile uphill to the trail. I started hiking with 2 women and asked their trail names and where they are from. One young lady named Sweep was from Chesapeake City, MD, which is 10 minutes from my house. You never who you will be hiking beside out here. By 11am there was a long climb uphill, it was hot and humid, and my beers last night were fast dripping out of me. I could hear thunder and hurried to the shelter on top of the mountain for lunch. There was a blue sky on the other side so I decided to push on 12.4 miles to the next shelter. This was a risk not just for the storm but also because there was over 9 miles of no water to the shelter. Only 1 other hiker left with me. The first 6 miles was some of the best trail I had seen, walking on the top of a mountain in exposed meadows. One thing is certain on the AT trail - when it is bad out it will get nice and when it's nice out it can get bad, real fast. The temperature suddenly dropped, the wind started blowing, thunder was behind me and coming fast, and I'm walking exposed on top of a mountain in the grass. Plan A - walk as fast as I can to get cover down in the woods and pitch my hammock tarp; Plan B - hunker down on top and find 2 trees to pitch my tarp. The wind picked up and here come big rain drops. Time for Plan B. The wind and rain picked up as I struggled to secure the tarp corners that were flapping in the wind. I finally secured my tarp, pulled out my seat cushion, laid back on my backpack, and watched the lightening, rain and wind blow through like a freight train. It was over in 30 minutes but I continued to lay there until I heard a loud crack. I knew exactly what it was, I looked out and up and there it was - my tarp was pitched beside a large dead tree with ""widow maker"" type branches that were now water logged and ready to fall. I packed up quickly away from that tree and was back on the trail. I didn't make to the next shelter until 8.30pm and after 19.5 miles was exhausted and dehydrated. Too tired to get water or eat dinner, I just set up my hammock and went straight to bed. Another exciting and EXHAUSTING day on the AT.

We are supposed to meet at a road crossing on an isolated road near Captain, VA with a planned 3pm meeting time. I miss her a lot and will crawl on my hands and knees to get there. It was a good start to the day hiking along a creek when I came to the sign for the ""Captain's"". Captain is a former thru hiker who allows hikers to camp in his yard, provides free sodas in a fridge on his back porch, and hosts a free annual party 2 weeks after Damascus Trail Days. His property is located across the creek we hike beside and he has rigged a zip line with a seat and hook for your back to cross the creek (see pic). I missed the annual party and today's trail magic of pancake breakfast but I had to try the zip line seat and get a soda. It is quite a place and Captain's is a quite a trail angel. I was the first one on the trail this am (you can tell by how many cobb webbs on your face) and I started what looked like a short climb up to the next shelter.

I'm making good time and will get to our meeting spot right on time until it happenned.....rocks! (see pic) It was a trail of rocks for 1.5 hours and slowed me down to a crawl. I kept telling myself ""don't rush, don't push"" for fear of an injury and missing GH. Finally I hit some VA dirt and picked up my pace when it started to sprinkle, but no time for rain jackets. The wind started to blow as I reached the shelter .8 miles from our meeting point to see 4 guys sitting there. They all had ""should I stay or should I go and chance getting caught in a storm"" look. I said Hi as a I motored on by them. Little did they know I had high hopes of seeing my wife in less than a mile. I made it to the road crossing a little after 4pm and I spotted our blue Subaru!

He did amazingly well and stayed behind me and crossed bridges over streams without a problem. This guy has potential! It felt good to be hiking after 2 days off - my feet felt better and my muscles were recuperated from all the food I have been eating. I flew up the first 1,700 ft climb and broke in my new shirt - it was soaked with sweat. After a ridge top walk and a long down hill, I was greeted with a 1.5 mile cow pasture walk. I came across a wet, marshy area in the pasture and had to cross a small bridge over a stream. There was a small dam beside the bridge and I spied 2 copperheads laying out on the dam! I immediately looked all around me for more - on the bridge, under the bridge and thought about that long, pasture grass I had to step in. Luckingly no more snakes. You can't let your guard down out here and have to aware of your surrondings at all times. Once the trail left the pasture fields it went straight up 1,000 ft. After over 600 miles of hiking, you would think that climbing a hill would be easy - NOT. There are different styles of hiking uphill: 1-put in your ear buds and attack it like a CrossFit workout; 2-downshift into ""Granny Gear"" and take it easy; 3-hike fast for 20 yards, take a 30 second break, and repeat; 4-my way which is to keep the same heart rate all the way to the top and but don't stop until you reach the top. This hill just kept going up and got steeper, where was the end? I did my slow walk recovery at the top and got a drink once my heart rate came back down. Once on the top of the mountain, the trail popped out on some rocks for a nice view. Little did I know, we would stay out on these rocks for the next hour. When I say rocks, they were large, off camber (slanted), about 45 degrees (see pic), that had small cracks of edges you had to find for your foot.

We go to the same church my wife went to last Sunday. Sometimes attending a different church gives a new perspective. I certainly enjoyed this parish community and my daughters did as well. I keep thinking that this would be a nice place to live. We head back to the H. Inn to pack my bag and checkout. Before I move on, in my prior job I traveled a lot and stayed in many hotels around the world. We would never consider staying in a Holiday Inn unless it was a last resort. I have to say, after staying in dumpy non-chain motels, I'll take a H.Inn any day. We pack up, head to the Kroger for last minute things, and have a nice lunch at 3 Little Pigs. My wife gave the kids instructions to make sure I eat a lot with all the weight I have been losing. I was stuffed and mission accomplished. We head to the trail and it was time to say goodbye. The trail has turned me into softy and all my emotions are near the surface instead of buried in a remote place. Hugs and kisses and it was time to start hiking. I was dropped off at 1.40pm and I crank out 14 miles by 7pm. It must have been all the food I was eating because I was flying. I take a quick dip in a swimming hole at Jennings Creek and call it a night. During my quick hike I can't get the closing song from church out of my head ""we are companions on the journey, breaking bread and sharing life"". Applies to the AT as well doesn't it.

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538078,"I woke this am with thoughts of doing big miles today and over the next couple of days/weeks to finish VA. After visiting with my wife and daughters the past 2 weekends, the thought of having more visits with family and Yankee friends up north was a motivator. I get started at 8.30am and ease into a warmup pace before I start pushing. I'm a hiking machine - my heart, lungs, legs, and butt are firing on all cylinders - how far can I go?   Out of nowhere and for no reason - boom! I'm stopped dead in my tracks with excruciating pain in my right foot. I suck it up and slow down for awhile and then pick it back up. Not soon after, another bomb of pain in my right foot and another stop. I slow down and make it to the shelter for lunch to think about what is going on. Its frustrating to think I have finally reached a hiking physical condition and now being held back by a small peroneal tendon in my foot. I recall another hiker we met this year (Older Dog) who is a couple years older than me tell us about his hike last year. Hiking was his job - up the same time everyday and cranked out 20-25 miles everyday, no matter the weather or the pain. He had pain in his foot but pushed on and when made it to Mass, he tore a tendon in his foot (peroneal?). His hike was over and he needed surgery to repair it. He rested and rehabbed his foot over the winter and is trying another thru hike this year. I played sports and have been active most of my life and have never heard anyone complain of their peroneal tendon. When I get to the shelter for lunch, I have 1 bar of service and do a quick search on this tendon. ""The peroneal tendon connects to muscle and helps move your foot in and out. Tendinitis caused by a repetitive overuse usually found in runners or hikers. Treatment is rest, ice, ibprofun, and stretching. If not treated, the tendon can have micro tears until it eventually tears completely"". Wow! My head just caught up with what my body is trying to tell me. Those 2 flare ups I had this am were probably micro tears. If don't get a game plan and deal with this, I'm going to tear this thing, need surgery, and end up in a cast the rest of summer. The closest I'll be to a trail will be on my deck. I decide to ""clip one of my wings"" and start a mandatory slow pace and only 12-15 miles a day. I know I did over 20 miles today, but that was due to a shelter and the campsite after it being closed due to bear activity. Can I salvage this hike or is the damage already done? Time will tell.Peace and love /|\FT","Jennings creek on VA 614

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538219,"Oh my how things can change in 24 hours. Remember I hiked on extra miles to the next camp site because of bear activity? When I arrived at this site late last night there was a handwritten note: June 01 - aggressive bear in the area do not stay here; June 06 - I stayed a few miles back and no problems, be smart and hang your food bag; June 10 - camped here last night and heard a bear sniffing around our tents. So lucky me, it was late, my foot was sore, and I'm hanging in my hammock like a bear burrito. Around 9.30pm I hear someone hiking towards me. She stops by the location of the note and I yell out ""I sure could use some company tonight"". She expected to find a lot of people here and was surprised to only find me. It was late and this was her planned stop so she asked to set her tent because me and use my bear bag rope. That was not a problem and I even handed her my head lamp that was bright with new batteries. I was awakened twice in the night with a large critter walking around in the leaves nearby. It was probably a deer and no aggressive bear. Around 6.30am I crawled out of my hammock to put my shoe on, my right foot was swollen. I could feel every centimeter of that shoe lace size tendon from behind my ankle to where it attaches on the outside of my foot. I took a long breakfast and thought about what to do with this foot pain. The advice accomplished thru hikers always give: 1 - listen to your body; 2 - hike your own hike; and 3 - and lastly take in all sites and activities you can. Well I did a poor job on #1 and paying for it now. I had plenty of warning alerts about my feet, ignored them, and now I'm dealing with 3 alarm fire. Still in pain I decided to crawl back in my hammock after breakfast to sulk. Luckily I have 1/2 bars of phone service and do some more research on this tendon. It is clear I need to 1-2 weeks of rest or this thing is going to tear and it will be ""game ova"". I do what I never thought I would do - I text my wife and said I might need to come home for awhile. She is so supportive and said I should see my ortho doc as well to know what I'm dealing with. My head and reasoning finally catches up to me and I agree to the plan. Before I know it, she is on her way to get me. I pack up and hike 8 miles to the nearest road crossing. I have a few flare ups of terrible pain that validates I'm making the right decision. So now I'm back in DE, in my own bed, hoping to see my doc tomorrow for a diagnosis.

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538353,"Do you have a personal relationship with your doctor? I do. I have been seeing my ortho doctor, Dr A, for a couple of years and he has seen me through a frozen shoulder, a torn meniscus in each knee, and cortisone and rooster comb lubricating shots for my arthritic knees. Dr A specializes in knees and athletes. Let me explain the “athlete” side of his specialty. Athletes are a different breed and beat to a different drum. They push their bodies to the extreme, enduring more pain than a normal person would to achieve a goal. Before I decided to hike the AT, I popped into see him to let him know about my trip, to ask about stretches for my bad knees, and gave him a link to our YouTube videos. I didn’t know what might happen on this trip, so it was best to put him on notice in case I came back in pieces and he has to put me back together. Since I resigned my job, my health insurance stopped. I elected to enroll in COBRA benefits to make sure we were covered in case of a catastrophe. COBRA is a federal law that allows individuals to pay for and continue their health insurance coverage from their former employer. Nothing is easy is with health insurance companies and the paperwork has not been processed to show that I have coverage. In order to confirm my appointment with Dr A’s office, I needed to verify my insurance. This was not going to happen until next week and my AT clock is ticking. Since Dr A knew I was hiking the trail, I put a call into Dr A’s admin and she leaves me vm that it is ok for me to come in to get checked out today. I go in for my examination and someone on Dr A’s staff said they just watched one of our YouTube videos and they enjoy following our adventure. Dr A comes in to see me, I tell him my knees are great but my feet are a mess from hiking on off camber terrain. He examines my right foot and pushes in all the places I don’t want him to. His slight touches were making me jump on the table and when he pushed on that peroneal tendon on the outside of my right foot, I jumped so hard I hit my head on the wall. He snickers and said no need to do any more examination or I could put a hole in his wall. Diagnosis: bad case of tendonitis which are small tears in the tendonPlan to recovery: 800 mg of IBP 3x a day for 2 weeks, ice and restFuture prevention: wear boots that cover the ankle and protect the tendonGreat, now I have the formula to get back to hiking but what about timing – when will I be as good as new? Most doctors would say take your medicine and in 1, 2, or 3 weeks you can resume your activities. I need a day, week, something to put on the calendar from Dr A. But he won’t give me one! This is why he specializes in athletes. He is wise enough to know that #1 – don’t ever tell knuckleheads like me “Not” to do something because I’ll do it to prove him wrong; #2 – don’t tell me when it feels better go back to hiking because that could be tomorrow. He knows how bad I want to do this but leaves the timing to return to the trail up to me. The longer I rest, ice and let the medicine do its job the better chance of success I’ll have.   Ugh – I went to this appointment expecting to come out with a quick fix, but now my recovery and chance of success is my responsibility and I don’t have the best track record in this category.Well this Appalachian Trail adventure is turning into an Appalachian Trial for me. Let’s see how long I can rest and recuperate before I explode and decide to get back out there.BTW – my daughter did a nice job putting together video #6.

It's nice to be home and to be with my family on this day, but I'm missing the trail. I have been home since Tuesday night and slowly acclimating back into the real world. Before I came off, I was hiking for 10 hours a day and alone with my thoughts for most of that time. The number of hikers left on the trail was thinning and it was infrequent to see or speak with another person.   Now I have to carry on regular conversations with people instead of with all the crazy thoughts in my head. My foot(feet) are slowly healing and getting better everyday. I don't know how much longer I can take this. I can feel myself entering a black fog - I miss the trail, my fellow hikers, the physical activity, the views, living outside, the adventure, and the endorphins that comes with it. Tick, tock, tick, tock - time moves so slow at home. How many more days before I snap, pack up my gear and ask someone to take me back to trail? Then I hear a voice in my head, the one I would hear when hiking by myself - ""be patient, there is time to finish this, let your foot heal, make the most of your time with your family"".

My plan was to get back on the trail this Saturday and test out that foot. While at home, I caught up on some other hikers' trail journals. Will and Road Runner started March 01 and had a 4 month time frame and averaged 25 miles/day. Two days ago they were 190 miles from finishing and had to come off the trail due to a sore knee. They hiked 2,000 miles and did not finish. See their final post: http://www.trailjournals.com/entry.cfm?id=538842After reading their unfortunate demise, I may rethink my Saturday return date.

The side road we thought we were near was a short cut to a highway with lots of traffic all night long. Plus sleeping in a hammock for the first time in 15 days all added up to another sleepless night. Since I was slackpacking, I decided to go for a bigger day to put that foot to the test. I started slow and immediately felt my soreness - my feet from my new boots, my legs, and my back. Yesterday's 11 miles were a wake up call to my body. After a couple of miles my left knee was sore and stiff reminding me of my bad knees. I have to stop stepping down with my left foot to protect my right foot because it was causing another problem. By 8 miles I was exhausted, sleep deprived and thought about calling for a pick up in 3 miles but no cell service. By 10 miles I was yawning and could feel hot spots on my feet where blisters might be starting from my new boots. When I reached 13 miles I was at the bottom of a 4 mile climb and was out of gas.

That picture to the left was my day and says it all. I hiked a whole page in the AWOL guide book. I left by 7.15am today and planned on doing 19 miles that included a drop of 3k ft down the The Priest mountain and immediately back up 3k ft to the top of Three Ledges. I found I need to stop and take my boots off every 2-3 hours to help deal with the foot pain. With these boots, I also need to land on my heel and roll through my step otherwise my heel starts hurting.   I had lunch at the bottom of The Priest in a parking lot and decided to try my ""yoging"" skills. This means a thru hiker convinces a random stranger to give them food or drink. I told a lady that it was very hot and if she had any water. She gladly obliged and gave me a bottle - well done FT! I finished lunch and started hiking and guess who I ran into - the man, the myth, the 2016 AT hiker legend - Waterbug! (See pic) I have not seen him since the Partnership shelter back in Marion VA. He offered me a PBR which I gladly drank, we caught up on where everyone is, and he did his best to convince me to stay and party with him for the 4th of July. I have some hiking to do so I finished my beer, got his contact info, and said my goodbyes. There is nothing better than a beer and visiting with old friends to get you up a mountain. I met Stumbleweed (she falls a lot) yesterday and we have been leap frogging each other all day. As I was climbing, I saw a backpack on the trail ahead. Then I saw Stumbleweed at a small creek. I told her the shelter is close if she needs water but she told me her ankle gave out again and she fell, scraped her leg, shoulder and arm and was cleaning up and putting on an ankle brace. It was a skinny trail along the side of a mountain and she is lucky she didn't fall down the side. The climb up Three Ledges is no joke. From the shelter it was a 2k ft climb over 3.3 miles. I thought ""I've done worse, this will be no problem"". I was wrong. This climb was over large rock sections, a straight up scramble section and never ending switchbacks at the top. This mountain knocked the wind from me, chopped me at the knees, cleaned my clock and gave me a good beating.

By hiking with my wife (GH) for 52 days, our relationship went to another level. Sharing the incredible vistas, the physical pain, the wonderful people we met, the teamwork, and our emotional highs and lows with each other was priceless. After she left you all know I struggled, but sometimes you need to struggle to get to the next level. GH would always tell me I need to get in touch with my feelings and emotions. Hiking showed me where the key was to unlock the door to my feelings and emotions. Once I unlocked that door, my feelings and emotions came out like beautiful butterflies and birds singing amazing tunes. Once my feelings and emotions were unleashed, I was able to pass through door and I found an internal peace and harmony I have never experienced before. I can now check that off my ""honey to do list"". So yes, hiking will take you to some beautiful places and you can see some amazing critters, but you can also find a beautiful person that is buried inside you that is capable of so much love. There, you can thank me for saving you money by going hiking: no need for a therapist, marriage counselor, life coach, or self help books. Just lace up your shoes, enjoy the outdoors and the company you are with, even if you are alone.I just re-read this post and no I'm not tripping, I'm just high on life. Happy hiking!Peace and love /|\FT","Hightop hut

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541541,"Updates - road crossings: up to 20; bear sightings: another juvenile was on the trail ahead me (see pic to left). I was upwind and he was walking straight towards me but them walked into the woods. He looked like he was just 1 year old. One nice thing about the Shenandoah's - I have been eating a pot of prepared food. 2 nights ago I ate dinner at the Loft mtn campstore (microwave sandwich and coco milk) and then went back for breakfast (microwave sandwich and a coffee). Yesterday my blood sugar was low so I stopped at the Lewis mtn campstore and had the same microwave sandwich and coco milk. I made it to the High meadows wayside before it closed last night and had a burger, fries, and their famous black berry milkshake. While I was at dinner, I recognized a women coming in that I had camped with on June 08 (my b-day) after McAfee nob. We caught up and she invited me to hang my hammock at their campsite and I gladly accepted. First thing I did was start my laundry because my clothes were really ripe and then I jumped in the shower.   The showers were relatively new and clean. You have to put in $1.75 of quarters to get 5.30 minutes of shower. Now that I know I can get clean in 5.30 minutes, I'm going to reassess how long my showers are back home. We got up this morning and she dropped me off at 8am at the High meadows wayside again for breakfast and I had eggs, pancakes and coffee. I hitched a ride back into our campsite, packed up my gear and was off by 9.30am. It was a boring 7 mile hike along a hillside. On my right were t rocks straight up and on my left it was straight down into the woods. The trail followed Skyline Rd because I could hear the cars over the rocks to my right. After 7 miles of this, I jumped off the trail and headed .1 miles down to the Skyland restaurant where I had a chicken Caesar salad and a piece of black berry ice cream cake. There are 4 advantages to stopping at these eateries: 1 - a chance to eat prepared food with a lot of calories; 2 - I can use a toilet and wash up my face, arms, and hands from all the sweating; 3 - a chance to sit in the air conditioning in the middle of the afternoon when it is the hottest; and 4 - I ask them to fill up my 2L camelback with ice then water. It is so refreshing to suck ice cold water through that straw when it's so hot and humid out.I planned on eating lunch and getting back on the trail quickly but Boobytrap came in and sat down at my table. We caught up and he said he was waiting to meet his parents there and was burning time until they arrived. He carries a small guitar and reminds me of Owen Wilson in Meet the Fockers. Everything is ""cool"", ""right on"", and ""word"". Nice guy and I hope to see him again.I hope to get out of the Shenandoah's tomorrow.Peace and love /|\FT","High meadows campground

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541571,"Report Updates - I'm out of the Shenandoah Park; road crossings: final count is 30; bear sightings: 3 more bears seen today, #1 (pic to left) was this am and was a 2nd year bear, cute and watching me from behind a tree, I thought he was scared and was going to climb a tree but things changed quickly, he stood on his rear legs and reached up high with his front paws and raked the tree with his claws while letting out a weird noise (like a hiss), he was trying to intimidate me but I banged my trekking poles 3x and went running like a baby, but only for 20 yards and started walking back to the same tree, time for me to go; bear #2 (see pic) was another small bear and was rummaging around on the ground 15 yards to my left and didn't mind me at all and the same goes for bear #3 (see pic).Thought for today: beards! What's the big deal with a man having a beard. Today marks 100 days that I have not shaved. I take that back, I have shaved my neck to create a break in my hair otherwise I would have hair from my head to my toes. The plan is to continue to let this thing grow until I finish and who knows, I may keep it even after I finish. Why are people so uptight about beards? Do people think a man with a beard has something to hide (like his face)? Look at all the great people who have had beards: Greek philosophers, a lot of our Presidents (Abe L), college professors, scientists, inventors and let's not forget about ZZ Top. It has become common in our society for men to have a 3-4 day beard. What's up with that? It's hard to keep it at that length and women find the sharp whiskers irritating. Either shave or let it grow out like a man. I like my beard; GH likes my beard. Yes, it is full of white hair and makes me look older but hey, I am getting older. Enough of the close cropped beards. As of today I'm starting a new fashion trend - long beards. Let those whiskers grow and show everyone what you got! Peace and love /|\FT","Pass mtn hut

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541942,"First off, I was exhausted yesterday after almost 24 miles and finishing in the dark last night and didn’t have the energy to do a proper evaluation of the Shenandoah N. Park. So here it is:•        Trail: grade=B: nice trail, not too hard up or down, a few rock sections but not many, able to put in some long miles•        Vistas: grade=A: numerous panoramic views of nothing but mountains•        Skyline Drive: grade=C: the trail followed the road (or maybe the road followed the trail), crossed it 30x, and for adventure hikers, walking beside a road is boring; this is a popular rode for scenic drives for cars and motorcycles and there was a constant roar of Harley Davidson’s in the air; being a motorcycle enthusiast, I never thought I would say hearing bikes all day is noise pollution, but it is when you are used to hearing the birds sing and wind blow•        Camp stores: grade=B: it was convenient to be able to pop in for a cold drink, sandwich, and overpriced hiking food•        Campgrounds: grade=A: I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the bathroom, shower and laundry facilities; most campgrounds I have stayed out in the past usually have late night music and drinking, but the SNP campgrounds all full of respectful people who turn in early and don’t make a lot of noise or party •        Wayside restaurants: o        High Meadows: grade=C: dirty, lots of flies, poor serviceo        Skyland: grade=A: I thought I was in a city, good service, clean, great view, good foodOverall, it was a pleasant and fast 100 miles through the SNP, but if I had to do it again I would aqua blaze it. Aqua blaze means heading north on the trail but via water. The Shenandoah river cuts through the park and you can get out at Front Royal. Who knows, I might get bored sitting in a kayak all day as well but it’s better to try something new.Now for today’s update. GH left Delaware early this am to come visit today and tomorrow. I planned on leaving early to meet her, but I got off to a late start from the previous big day. In the first hour I saw a bear cub (cute little thing) run off the trail to my left which made me stop in my tracks – where is the mother? I spotted her 20 yards in the woods and she took off running making a noise which was good. Of course the trail looped around to the left, and there she was again, 20 yards into the woods checking me out. She took off running again and that’s the last I saw of her. No I wasn’t scared, these are magnificent creatures to see in the wild and she was just protecting her baby.I was at the top of a small hill and the trail went down a nice path in the grass - to my left was a chain link fence with barb wire on top and to my right were houses.   I was within a ½ mile to the parking area where I was to meet GH. As I crested the hill, a black bear was on the trail below me and stood on his hind legs to get a better look at me. As soon as he saw me, he couldn’t go right into the houses or left with the fence, so he started heading down the trail towards GH. I keep thinking, come on GH get up the trail and you will see a bear coming right at you, but half way down the trail the bear stopped. I thought he was checking me out, but no, he turned towards the fence and climbed over where the barbed wire had been pushed down. I watched him run a ¼ mile through an open grass field to get the woods on the other side.   I love watching bears.I finally met up with GH and Blaze (hiking puppy) filled up on food and Gatorade and slack packed the rest of day. I did a short 2.5 mile section up and over a hill with Blaze and saw him jump over logs and wait patiently for me to descend steep rock sections. He is going to be a good hiking dog and will be pretty to watch him climb up and over things when he is full grown. We had a nice dinner in Front Royal and stayed at the Mountain Home Cabbin. The plan is an early start tomorrow to finish VA.Peace and love /|\FT","Tom Floyd shelter

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541948,"The alarm went off at 5am and GH dropped me off at the trailhead for a 6.20am start. I’m tired of VA and want to get this over with but know this is going to be a tough day with the famous Roller Coaster (see pic) section coming up – 13.5 miles of steep up and downs. My legs feel rested and nourished at the start from all the food and drink GH pumped into me yesterday. The trail crossed a busy 4 lane highway, VA 601 Blueridge Mtn road, that was a little hairy getting across in morning rush hour traffic. After I passed the Rod Hollow Shelter, it was time for the Roller Coaster in the mid afternoon heat. I was glad to be slack packing on such a hot day and to know that GH was a couple miles ahead with cold drinks and snacks. The trail got very rocky, large rocks that you have to dance on. I don’t mind the steep up hills, but given my foot condition, I go at a snail’s pace down steep, rocky downhills. When I finally met up with GH at a road crossing, there was another young guy there giving trail magic as well. GH asked if I recognized him which I didn’t. It was No Pants – he gave us trail magic last September when we finished the 100 mile wilderness in Maine! What are the chances to have our lives cross paths again in such a random place in the middle of the woods. I push myself hard up the last couple of steep up hills and finally arrived at Snickers Gap by 3.40pm completely exhausted. GH threw me in the car and off we headed for the AT headquarters in Harper’s Ferry to get my hiker picture taken and register for my trail #. Fyi – GH and I already hiked the 39 miles from Snicker’s Gap to the Washington Monument (MD) last Memorial Day and I was not about to do it again. This is not the same as “yellow blazing”. Yellow blazing is advancing north bound by getting a ride in a car or taking a short cut side trail. You completely skip hiking the AT trail. Yellow blazing is like a drug, once you break the seal of guilt and do it once, you tend to do it again. If and when I finish this thing, when someone asks did you hike every mile of the trail, I will be able to look them in the eye and tell them yes.To be considered a “thru hiker”, you have to complete the trail within 12 months of when you started. Since I have already completed some sections, I’m considered a section hiker. Before we started this adventure on April 01, we completed 432 miles of the AT and the following sections:•        Springer GA to NC border: 75.6•        Snicker’s Gap VA to Palmerton, PA: 254.1•        Monson ME to Abol Bridge: 102.7So even though I’m hiking over 1,750 miles, I’m technically called a LASHER (Long A** Section Hiker). Oh well, it is still bad a** to be able to say “I hiked the entire Appalachian Trail” – every step of 2,189 miles and passed every white blaze.   The plan is to take a couple days rest in Delaware and start up again this Friday in Palmerton, PA. I will be walking away from home and this will be my last visit until Maine.  ?Peace and love /|\FT","Trico Tower trail

We start up the rock scramble at Palmerton and it is straight up, humid and exposed to the sun. My brother bounces straight up the rocks and I take my time with a heavy pack on. It's a little sketchy in some places which makes for some good pics. We complete the climb and hike 12 miles over rocks and bumped into Heisenburg, a hiker who I have not seen since trail days. We all agree to hike to Smith Gap road together where we were picked up by John Stempa. He lets hikers stay in his garage and use his shower, and shuttles you to the Kunckletown Pub for dinner. The pub doesn't have a liquor license so they give you comp beers with your dinner. It was a great chicken dinner and 2 beers for $15. John picked us up and we went back to his house for showers. It's a good deal and he only charges $10 for everything. After our showers, Heisenburg and I string our hammocks in the garage and my brother slept on the floor.

The Deer Inn is a higher end place so we took a table inside (air conditioning) and enjoyed a nice Sunday lunch while listening to someone play the guitar.

It was early afternoon and it was hot and exposed. J and J had picked up their pace and pulled away from me after the boardwalk.

It’s a short day of only 10 miles but I can’t even walk. I hike .5 miles to the first road crossing and tell them I’m calling it day. I plan on hitchhiking to the trailhead parking lot in Warwick, NY where their car is parked.J & J don’t have a map or a trail guide so I ask Joyride to do me a favor and hike/escort them. Joyride told me not to worry and that they are in good hands (that’s scary). We discuss a possible meeting time of 2-2.30pm.Man – it’s tough to hitch a ride up north. I finally took off 1 boot and leaned on my hiking poles with my thumb out. A guy stopped and agreed to take me to Warwick and dropped me at the Bellevue Farms Creamery (yum, yum) at 10.30am. The creamery is located on top of the hill with a great view of Warwick below. There is a large parking lot with picnic tables to sit and eat your ice cream while you enjoy the view. People would stop and get out of their cars just to enjoy the view. Unfortunately, the store didn’t open until 12pm, so found a shady spot against the building and sat on the sidewalk near the unlocked restroom and waited.Remember that fancy Moreno wool shirt I bought a couple days ago in Delaware Water Gap outfitter? Every night I hang my wet/sweaty clothes on my hammock ridge line to dry. Well 2 nights before, my shirt fell off the ridgeline and I found it ground the next morning. When I put it on, I had 3 inch round hole over my left should blade and numerous small holes on my left and right sleeves. Apparently a mouse had a field day chewing holes in my fancy shirt, probably for the salt. It looked like a rag and I was mad! This is my only hiking shirt so what could I do but continue to wear it.Three older women stopped to enjoy the view at the creamery, walked past me to use the restroom, and then stopped to talk to me. Given my holey shirt, long grey beard, backpack, and sitting against the wall they all thought I was a homeless! I answered all the usual questions about hiking the AT and explained what happened to my shirt. They told me to have a nice day and left for their car. One women returned, said she felt bad for what happened to my shirt and said “here is a new Yankees shirt you can wear.” Just 5 minutes earlier, I was sulking about my foot, and then the kindness of a stranger picked up my spirits. I believe 99% of people want to help others in need and this is just another example of why hiking the AT is such an incredible experience.Joyride, J & J struggled and didn’t finish until 3.30pm. Apparently the trail was harder than expected and the heat, and exposed sun made it worse. J & J hiked 36 miles over 2.5 days and got a little taste of the trail and the people on it.

The plan is to rest and ice this foot so I can get back on the trail tomorrow. So I was planted in a chair at his house, icing my foot for 20 minutes every 2 hours, and popping 800mg of IBF 3x a day. It’s been a long time since I sat in front of a TV for so long and I got caught up on the election, sports, and the weather. The next 5 days are going to be in the high 90’s so maybe I’m better off siting in the A/C icing my foot.I don’t miss watching TV and thought about how expensive my cable bill is back home. Since I have been hiking, you learn that a simple life is a happy life and I may have to make changes with my cable provider when I finish the trail. Tonight is the concert and I finally meet his friends, Steve, Paul, and Jonesy who are all as nice as Jim. We enjoy a nice tailgate party on the hot pavement outside the MetLife stadium before the concert. Lenny Kravitz is the warm up band and we proceed to walk in the stadium. I immediately have foot pain and struggle to keep up with everyone. I also struggle up the steps as we make our way to our seats on the 3rd level and catch the end of Lenny’s performance. Guns n Roses played for over 2 hours and were amazing. Even though the lead singer Axl Rose is older, he put on a great performance on a hot night and looked like a hiker with a continuous drip of sweat rolling off his elbow. They played for over 2 hours and finished after 12.30 as I struggled to stay awake. In case you don’t know, hikers are usually in bed shortly after dark and most are sleeping before 10pm every day. Sitting so high up in stadium seats for so long made my foot swell up like a balloon. There was no way I was going to be able to walk to the car, especially in a crowd of people, so I asked a stadium worker for a wheelchair. Yes, I asked for a wheelchair.

I know hikers who left the trail just for this reason – their wives missed them and called them home. Am I being selfish out here hiking the trail? Is it fair to her to deal with everything? How much longer can she take this? Some days the guilt is too much for me and I think about leaving the trail to be with her. Other days it motivates me to keep moving forward, to put in more miles, to finish this thing as fast as I can for her. I/we didn’t plan on the emotional pain this hike is causing on our relationship.The priority now is to get this foot looked at by the Dr and so I can formulate a recovery plan. Meanwhile, GH is happy to have me home for a while. More to come.Peace and love /|\FT","Jim's house

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543595,"I apologize for not updating my blog timelier but I have been struggling mentally with another foot injury. Today I put my happy face on, caught up with my posts, and will focus on getting better.I called Dr. A’s office at 7.50am today and was fortunate to get an 8.30am appointment (maybe because I’m a frequent flyer patient). I last came to see him on June 14 for my right foot peroneal tendonitis and now I’m back on July 25 for a diagnosis of my lower shin/ankle pain in my left foot.  Before I went back to see the doctor, they sent me for an x-ray. I walk down the hall to x-ray provider, sign in, get called back for my x-ray, and I’m back in my Dr’s office in 10 minutes. Two minutes later, I get called back to an exam room and Dr A comes right in. Today’s my lucky day and things are moving right along. He and his staff have been following my blog and he knows how important finishing the AT is to me. He pulls up the x-ray and said it looks good and no stress fractures but asks “how old I was when I broke my ankle?”   I looked at him funny and said “what are you talking about, I never broke my ankle”. He showed me the line on my bone and said it must been when I was between 7-10 years old based on where the break was from my growth plate. There you go readers – now you know who you are dealing with. I was raised in an era where you “suck it up” and deal with your pain. So Dr A knows if I come in to see him, something is wrong. Today, everyone runs to the Dr for a splinter or a runny nose. Our modern society needs to get a grip and realize sometimes there is physical pain that you have to endure and you don’t have to run the Dr for pill so I don’t have to suffer.Dr A examines my foot, puts his hand on the top of my ankle where it is swollen, asks me to move my foot up and down, and he feels my creaky tendons moving up and down. Bingo – swollen extensor tendons getting snagged in the sheath that holds them in place while they move up and down. Ugh!!! Tendonitis!! I have grown to hate that word!! I know the routine - rest, anti-inflammatories and rest until it is better. I told him I have made it just over the NJ/NY border on the trail, I have too much invested to stop now, and need to get this healed asap so I can finish this before the snow flies in Maine. Instead of the 800mg IBF, he prescribes a 5 day pack of steroids that should work faster on the inflamation. So there you have it. I’m home again in Delaware resting, on “the magic juice”, and waiting to get back on the trail. How long it will be I don’t know but I’m definitely going back on the trail so stay tuned.Peace and love /|\FT","Home

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544573,"It’s time to get this party started! Today is the 14th day I have rested my left foot at home. I’m back out to the trail tomorrow.  I took 14 days off in June for tendonitis in my right foot and now 14 days off for tendonitis in my left foot. This adventure is either going to be: “third time’s a charm” or “3 strikes and you’re out”. Is it my destiny to hike the AT in 2016? Or wasn’t it meant to be? It’s time to find out.I did the math and have 715 miles to finish the trail and only 5 miles left to complete NJ. The hardest part of the trail is ahead of me in White Mountains and S. Maine. It has numerous mountain climbs that are sketchy (hiker word for dangerous) that will slow me down. They say when you reach NH you have completed 80% of the AT but only expended 20% effort. I need 2 healthy feet (pain free) to expend 80% effort over the last 20% of the trail.GH will drop me off where I left off near Warwick, NY. Tomorrow will be a good test for my foot because I am starting with a tough 10 mile section and only have 5 miles left to complete NJ.  I read Slipknot’s trail journal today and he finished the trail yesterday. He started in January and summited Katahdin yesterday with his daughter. I’m jealous and want the same thing – to have my beloved family around me when I finish this thing.So here I go – 1 day at a time, 1 mile at a time, 1 step at a time to fulfill that dream in my head of standing next to that sign on top of Mt Kahadin.

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545084,"Just by chance, Waterbug calls me the night before I'm heading back on the trail, says he is in Delaware, and needs a ride to the trail. I told him it's your lucky day and be ready at 8.30am the next morning.We pick him up and it was a long 3.5 hours back to where I got off the trail. As we got closer to the drop point, GH sees a bear in someone's yard.We finally make it to trail and as I was sitting on the Subby back bumper, a female hiker came out of the trail for the road crossing. She looked familiar and then I remembered her name - it was Crispi. The last time I saw her was the night in Bland, VA when we all stayed in the pavilion. We got caught up and GH asked if she wanted to slackpack this section, of course she said yes.I took off first since I had a sore foot and figured Waterbug and Crispi would soon pass me. I remember when Joyride and my friend did this section and how tough it was in 95 degree weather. It was 80 and cloudy when we left and the weather was not a factor. There were a couple of rock scrambles and one section actually had a rebar ladder up a straight wall. 4 miles into the hike I crossed the NJ/NY border. Wow - I just finished state #8 and only have 4 more to go. 0.4 miles into NY I came to the highest AT point in NY. It was marked with an American flag and was picturesque. Once I descended off the rocks and into woods, I saw a bear. I love seeing bears! It saw me and made his way deeper into the woods.Even though Crispi had passed me early on, I felt great and was flying. I was the first to finish and GH treated me with and egg salad sandwich and a beer. She's a keeper!Crispi and Waterbug pushed on another 2 miles to the shelter. GH and searched for a place to stay or tent with a dog but kept coming up empty. It was now 8.30pm and getting dark so we went back to the creamery and asked if we could tent in the grass above their parking lot. Thank goodness they said yes. It was past 9.30pm when we finally made it in our tent with our pup Blaze. With GH leaving tomorrow am, I'm a little worried about my feet and if I can finish this hike.

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545093,"We were up early with the puppy so GH made a coffee run and we ate breakfast at the creamery picnic tables. We packed up, headed for the trail, and said our goodbyes. Each time we separate it gets harder, especially knowing our 30th wedding anniversary is fast approaching on August 23 and I will be hiking the trail. I feel so selfish and guilty. I should be planning a special trip for her to have endured being married to me for so long. Instead, I'm walking in the woods getting farther from home everyday. I head into the woods and within 10 minutes I see another bear. It was a little one and he took off and ran until he was out of sight. I noticed the older/bigger bears either walk away or don't run far and the younger/little ones run until they are out of sight. 2 days in NY - 2 bear sightings.I make it to the shelter and Waterbug is the only one there. We talk for awhile and start hiking together. The humidity continues to climb And the temp is in the low 80s. it's going to be a miserable day.We come to trail maintenance crew who are putting in a 2 plank wide Boardwalk over a muddy section. I thanked them for their volunteer service and they told us there is water and frozen water ice for hikers ahead. What a treat! Frozen water ice is amazing when you are dripping with sweat and the water was ice cold. Thanks NJ/NY long distance trail crew!As we continue up the trail and the sweat is pouring out of us. The awol guide shows a little blip in the trail ahead. I look ahead and see a stone cliff wall starting us down. This puppy was straight up and someone found a trail to go up it. It was exhausting and made the sweat spigot go even faster. We make it over and down the other side and approach a gravel road crossing. Someone left a water jug and Waterbug was filling up when a truck stopped at the trail. His name was Patty-o and he was there for trail magic. He had 4-5 coolers in the bed and gave us a soda, tea, and snacks. He asked if we drank alcohol and we both laughed. Before I knew it I had a red cup full of coconut rum and waterbug had a rum and coke. We had a good time until the thunder turned into a downpour so we took off in the rain. I don't know if it was the rum or rain, but we were flying - up hills, downhills, on the flats. We approached another road crossing and someone had left apples, bananas and water. That's 3 trail magics in one day!We picked up another hiker, Huckleberry, and headed up another hill. More sweating! The backside of this hill headed down to I87 crossing and it was straight down. It took the 3 of us a good while to look for good foot holds on the wet rocks/roots so we didn't get hurt. I stopped at the parking lot because my friend Kevin is going to pick me up and let me stay at his house for a couple of days. While I'm waiting, I notice my shorts are dripping, could be water but most likely its sweat so i call Kevin and tell him I need a towel or a blanket so I don't ruin his seats.He picks me up and I get a hot shower, which was priceless, wash my sweaty clothes, and sleep in air conditioning. I'm in hiker heaven!Peace and love /|\FT","NY17A Bellvale NY

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545197,"Kevin and I were up early and we made it to 8am Mass. I usually go to church every Sunday when I'm home and it's nice go when I can. Kevin wanted to experience the trail so we packed up a couple of day bags with water and snacks and hit the trail by 11am. We took it easy so he could acclimate to rocks, uphills and downhills. He did a great job for the first 9 miles and wanted to push on an extra 2 miles over Black mtn. It was easy trail for the first mile, but the last mile up Black mtn was a series of short, steep, rock sections. I was sitting on a rock on top of the last section as Kevin slowly made his way up. I heard rustling in the 3 foot thick weeds behind me and thought a hiker was coming down and I would have to move off my nice rock. The rustling was coming right at me so I stood up to take a look. As soon as I stood up, I hear Kevin say ""hey bear"". I look at Kevin to see where he is looking and 15 yards to my right is nice looking black bear.The bear sees Kevin and looks at me and decided to make his own trail down the steep rock section. He gets to the bottom and looks back to check us out. What a beautiful creature. The AT gave us the chance to see a black bear on our last climb. This trail really is a special.We had a great day and Kevin finally got to see what hiking the trail is all about. We went back to his house for showers, dinner and another night sleeping in the A/C. I now have been treated by 2 friends who have taken me into their houses. My wife made the comment that I'm a VIP, but then quickly corrected herself and told me I am blessed to have such good friends. I couldn't agree more - I am very blessed to have a loving wife, kids, extended family, friends, and strangers I don't know who are praying for me.I am blessed!Peace and love /|\FT","Arden Valley rd parking lot

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545203,"Kevin dropped me off at 6.30am on his way into work in NYC. It was cool, low humidity and good hiking weather. I came upon a camp site a mile into the trail and thought how lucky I was to be hiking so early before it got hot. I made it to the top of bear mountain and in Perkins Tower. It is a lookout tower with great views in all directions. What I liked most about the tower were the old pictures and stories around the walls on every floor. It's amazing what the Perkins and Harriman families have done to create this beautiful place for NYC people to escape the black top jungle. Even though it is a state park, it truly is a national treasure.I make my way down bear mtn to Hessian lake and have a burger and soda at the food stand. It was Monday and I noticed most of the picnickers were Hispanic. Large families with wagons of food in tow for a good old fashion cookout around a nice lake. I head down towards the bear mtn zoo and walk through a pool area. It is a large, clean blue pool with only a handful of people swimming . The sign says a $2 entrance fee. I jokingly ask if they can give me a break and they told me thru hikers get in free. Yes!I must have been a site walking along the pool in hiking boots and backpack. I strip down and jumped in with hiking shorts on since they are quick drying. It felt so good to be swimming like normal people on a hot day instead of hiking. I do a quick dry in the in the sun and head for the zoo. The AT runs right through the zoo. It is a little zoo and free for everyone. It has mostly small animals and I could tell from the urine odor coming from some cages that it must be run on a tight budget. I finally make it to the black bear cages which is the lowest point on the AT, 177 elev. ft. This is my 4th day in NY and my 4th bear sighting (even though it is behind bars).I walk over the Hudson River on the bear mtn bridge. Given the historic significance of the Hudson, For some reason it felt special walking over this river.I met a new North bound hiker named Prov. She is tall and can really move own the trail. She is the only person I met until I make it to the Appalachian Market right on the trail. There I met up with Thumper, Google, Firefly, Noodles, and Prov and 5 other hikers I don't know. It's a loud crowd and they plan on staying at the Spiritual center, the same place I wanted to stay. I decide to hike another 1.5 miles past them and stealth camp along the trail to get a better night sleep. My feet are sore and I need the rest.

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545356,"In case you have not noticed, I have a handicap. Besides being a little unbalanced mentally, I have bad feet. I can feel the tendons in both feet while I’m hiking – the side of my right foot, the top of both feet. It is a slight pain that if ignored could lead to my hiking demise. Since this is my last shot, I have been going slowly and gradually building up my daily mileage. Even taking it easy, I feel the pain at night on the top of my right foot while moving around in my hammock. So I pop 800mg of IBF before I go to sleep and as soon as I wake up to try and calm it down. I plan on an early start to beat the heat and rely on the birds to wake me up. Unfortunately, there are no birds and I don’t wake up until 6.30am. I get dressed, pack up, and get on the trail by 7.15am, an hour later than planned. The water sources in NY have been crap. The bottom of the streams and water color are black, or rust color – too nasty for even Bear Grills to drink from. Hikers have been relying on the kindness of New Yorkers who been generous in leaving gallon jugs of water at road crossings. At one crossing, I saw 15 jugs of water lined up. Thanks to everyone in NY for helping us poor hikers.After my first mile, I see water coming out of the hillside. In case you don’t know, it’s possible that brooks and streams could be contaminated with animal waste which can cause Giardia. There is little chance that water coming directly out of a hillside has been contaminated. This water looks clean, there is good flow coming out of the ground and someone has placed a long leaf on top of a rock for the water to run over. This is as good as it is going to get, so I stop and filter 3 liters of water.My plan is to hike 17 miles today to the RPH Shelter. Apparently it is close to a road and you can order take out Italian or Chinese food and they will deliver to the shelter.  The heat and humidity pick up and I am sweating. The trail is mostly in the shade, but there are occasions where the trail opens up and the sun starts to bake you. I start struggling early and often throughout the day. My hiking style has always been slow on the down hills and fast on the up hills. Not today - I have no pep in my step and crawl up every hill. The trail skirts past the Clarence Fahnestock State Park. They allow you 1 free night stay and there is a lake, beach, swimming, and a concessions stand. I can hear children frolicking in the water and it sounds so tempting, but not today, I’m on a mission for large take out order. To rub salt in my wound, the trail goes up the side of mountain with a rock overlook down at the beach and I can see people swimming – ugh! I’m hot and should be down there, but its 2pm, I’m dragging tail and would not want to leave if was swimming so I push on the last 5 miles to the shelter.Thumper catches up with me the last mile and we have a nice chat. We arrive at the shelter and I grab the Italian menu, call them up and ask about their tomatoes for their salads. I have been craving a good tomato. Are they cherry or regular? Are they red inside or white? She convinces me they are good so I order a garden salad with lots of tomatoes, a calzone and a 2 liter of soda. I was dehydrated and hungry, ate everything and drank 95% of the 2 liter bottle. It was delicious and I felt better.It was just Thumper and I at the shelter and we are trying to stay ahead of the loud hikers. As it was getting dark, here come all the loud hikers marching into the shelter. Over 10 hikers who are excited to order Chinese and beer – it was going to be a loud night! They are so inconsiderate to other hikers who go to sleep early and get up early. I finally fall asleep at 9.30pm only to be awakened with loud laughing. I look to the side of my hammock, and they moved their party away from the shelter and near my hammock – I just can’t win. It was 11.30pm when the last 2 called it a night.Never again.

Full Throttle and Grasshopper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545440,"I’m up early and on the trail by 6.45am. I wanted to make a lot of noise to wake the loud hikers but why bother, they would probably sleep through it and no good would come of it. I’m shooting for my first 20 mile day to get me past the AT train station stop and away from everyone. It is supposed to rain today and the next 5 days so I have a good chance to pull away.It is humid, humid, humid. I wish it would rain. By 7.30am my shorts are completely soaked in sweat and I am dragging. I should be fresh from all the food and soda last night, but I’m still crawling up the hills. At 5 miles, there is road crossing and a deli 0.4 miles up the road. I usually don’t go an extra 0.8 miles (round trip) on side trails, but it is 9am and I’m struggling so I went for it. I ate a deli sandwich and drank a ½ gallon of Gatorade and immediately started to feel better. Now I realize why I’m struggling – I’m not eating and drinking enough. It starts to rain so I head back to the trail.As I’m walking in the light rain I’m feeling better and better. The humidity and temp is dropping and I’m getting a burst of energy from the food and drink. My pace picks up a bit and I can feel all my tendons – on top of my left foot, on the side of my right foot and up my calf, and a new pain top of my right foot – this is a new tendon pain but I keep going to the next shelter. By the time I get there at 12pm, my feet are soaked in my “so called” waterproof boots. So I take off my boots, remove my super feet inserts, and ring out my wet, nasty soaks while the rain picks up. I sit and read through the trail log to see when all my friends came this shelter for inspiration. At 1pm there is a break in the rain, so I pack up and get going.Within 5 minutes, I’m in a torrential downpour and the trail has turned into a river. The sandwich and Gatorade I had earlier have been metabolized and I have pep in my step. I feel like I’m back in my hiking groove and blazing down the trail even in terrible weather. And then it happened…Incredible pain in my right foot like a snake bit me and stopped me in my tracks. My peroneal tendon is flaring up in my right foot just like before. Damn! This can’t be happening. I am listening to my body and my right foot is not happy so I slow it down. I come to a steep downhill and BAM! another burst of pain in my right foot. The new tendon pain on top of my right foot is constant, but the pain on the outside of my right foot and up the outside of my calf is bringing back memories of Glasgow, VA. I’m soaked, my socks are soaked, and I’m hiking slowly but it feels like I have a high ankle sprain.I arrive at beautiful lake, Nuclear Lake, and sit on a rock to assess my situation. I have been taking IBP to try and stay ahead of the tendon inflammation, now I have high ankle pain, and intense flare ups of pain. I call GH to tell her the news and to get her thoughts. We discuss my symptoms, compare them to my prior tendonitis problems and agree that if I continue to hike, it is only going to get worse. She offers to come get me and I can rest up at home and try it again. I tell her this is my 3rd and last attempt and I either stay or come off the trail. She asks if I want her to come get me and there is a long silence….....She asks again and another long silence……. I can’t bring myself to say it and want her to say it but she won’t and never will……. After 2 minutes of no talking, I finally call it and ask if she can come pick me up for the last time. My hike is over.I spent many a day dreaming of my summit day and touching that sign at the end. Dreaming of having that sign to myself, how I would feel to finish the trail, the different pic poses at the sign, how I would tell that sign all the joys and suffering the trail put me through ……………Sorry, I just dropped a tear on the keyboard, a tear that was meant for Katahdin. Why do I have bad feet? I have been athletic my entire life, and now I have bad feet. I’m a doer and get things done and this is incomplete for me. Why me? Everyone was counting on me to finish and I feel like I let everyone down. Oh stop your whining you big baby. You have been hiking since April 01, that’s 4 months and 10 days, made it to mile 1445, and 10 miles shy of finishing NY. You have seen beautiful vistas, met wonderful people, and seen bears and snakes. Stop wallowing in self-pity because you need to finish the remainder of this trail and then you will be able to look everyone in the eye and say “I HIKED THE AT!”I want to thank everyone who helped and supported me along the way – Sarah and Shane in TN, Dr A and his staff, Sam I am, my friends Jim and Kevin, my brother, and all the other Trail Angels who leave special goodies at road crossings or who gave me rides while hitch hiking. This trail shows you that 99% of people are good and want to help others. I also want to thank everyone who has been following along on my blog and for posting to my guestbook. You have no idea how special it was to read your encouraging words. I look at the view counter to the left and never realized a regular “Joe” like me could have so many people wanting to read about my experiences. Just know that I felt your support while I was struggling and I hope I didn’t let you down by not finishing. I also want to thank my loving family. I missed you every day and could feel you pushing me north as I hiked towards Maine. Last but not least is GH. A hiker is only as good as the support people behind them, and I couldn’t ask for a better support person for the trail or in life. I thought the pic above says it all. I followed those white blazes for 1445 miles and they kept me from getting lost. It was the only thing on my daily “to do” list – follow the white marks on the trees. Now I’m heading back to the real world where there are no blazes and I hope I don’t get lost in the hustle bustle of life. That’s it my friends. Wishing you can find peace and love in the outdoors like I have. Signing off for now until I find my next adventure. Peace and love /|\FT","RPH Shelter
