S.M. King,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479417,"“Between every two pines is a doorway to a new world.” - John MuirI thought starting to prepare now when the anticipated date is 19 months away, was probably me being silly. I spoke about it with only one friend initially;one who also harbors the dream of walking the AT. Between the two of us it kindled a fire. For me it has taken on the size of a conflagration and I've immersed myself in all things 'trail' for a couple of weeks now. The trail was under my feet before I even knew what the AT was. Day trips to Amicalola Falls with one of my children and my late husband; Dragon's Tooth; Nantahala; Clingman's Dome wayyyy back when I was married the first time and so scared of the wild that it is still a joke among my ex-in-laws to this day nearly thirty years later. But I've changed.A direct tornado hit brought the jump-off into change. Then death brought much more change, although it was in progress before even either of those. Each challenge to 'life' as we think of it sent me further into wildness. I lived in the heart of the AT briefly before moving to a holler in NE TN, and then further out into the farmlands of NW TN, the place that I will move back to once my hike is complete. Along the way will come completion of debt payoff, some surgery, maybe another grandchild's birth, even a child's marriage perhaps, culminating with a departure from the world of IT that I have inhabited since the 90's. We see often a parent's concern for a child wanting to try their wings on the trail. I'm the reversal of that common theme. My children are worried about their Mom hitting the trail. And I've not even told MY Mom; I'll wait until there is just a short window for her to freak out. My original plan was to hike the AT for my 50th birthday year, having a husband to hold down the fort financially while I did the walk. Then he died suddenly and abruptly at forty, and my entire life changed. Just now it seems to be evening out a bit - feels less shaky and numb. It took over five years to get here. The oldest girl took it upon herself to question me, representative of the trio. They feel lost a bit at my determination to live remotely, off-grid, and in the woods when I am done. They seem even more tentative about the hike. She asked me, ""What are you looking for out there?"" I didn't know how to articulate that it isn't 'out there' where I find it; it is inside of me. That part of me that feels energized, alive, able to give more, when I am surrounded by woods, dirt, and water. I tried to explain it. I'm pretty sure I fell short, like everyone does when they try to articulate the pull of the land to people who like their Starbucks close at hand, their trip to WalMart less than fifteen minutes away, and cannot conceive of being without running water or a flush toilet. I can't blame them, they are young and full of the 'American Dream' push to have and do more. I blame myself a bit, as I didn't always show this simmering side of me to them until the last ten years or so. Perhaps by continuing example, I can show them that there is more than the mortgage, student loan, credit card debt lives that we count as 'success'. At worst, I'll show them how to fail with grace In the interim, I hope they develop some enthusiasm and lose some fears about my journey. ~SheWhoHasNoTrailNameYet (aka She on WB)",,Springer,"Dec 26, Fri",0
S.M. King,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479841,"""Nonconformity is an affront to those in the mainstream. Our impulse is to dismiss this lifestyle, create reasons why it can’t work, why it doesn’t even warrant consideration. Why not? Living outdoors is cheap and can be afforded by a half year of marginal employment. They can’t buy things that most of us have,...” (David Miller, AWOL on the Appalachian Trail)This statement jumped out at me during a read of Miller's book last week, particularly in light of the conversational tone of my daughter lately. I have heard ""Why can't you be like other people?""I don't know the answer to that question. Many of my choices since my spouse's death have confused some family members. I am not falling into line with familial perceptions of 'grandmother', 'mother', 'daughter', or 'sister'. I am okay with that at this point. I am filling in the skin that I like, even though I don't like making them uncomfortable.This week's challenge. Hike to store, purchase what I think five days of food will be on the trail, prepare it and consume it. Granted, my neighbors probably think I am daft. I would think I was daft if I were one of them and nosing about other people's lives. Who cooks their food on a tiny Esbit stove wearing a headlamp in town? (and discovers one of the cookset tips over when lifted by the handle, spilling nearly an entire meal!) Why is she wearing the same clothes day in and day out? Why does she wear a huge backpack while walking her dog for two hours a night? And so forth.Secondary challenge was wearing the same clothing (I got to work from home part of this week), washing it, 'trail' bathing and trying to determine how best to alleviate potential 'hiker stench'. Thankfully I'll be following Fall so I should miss some of the heat that causes much of the problem. But I'm still gonna sweat, and it's still going to get odiferous. I just hope to find a combo that I can live with. Dirty I don't mind much; stink I do mind, lol!So yeah, I get it. I don't fit the labels terribly well. But I am learning. I am preparing. I am growing. From learning the weight of water and food, to how to treat blisters and road rash, to how long a fuel cube lasts and how to sequence cooking, it is all knowledge gained. And I am happy. Sleeping bag and tent should arrive next week in time for practice prior to my trip in February. I'm looking forward to it (and maybe even freaking out the neighbors by sleeping on the patio...whoop, whoop!)'Till next time.~She",,Springer,"Jan 04, Sun",0

I don't have a 'support' person, partner or anything. Buying on trail won't allow me the more 'healthy' choices (although Snickers and Li'l Debbies will make their way in there, hah!) This part is challenging. Maybe a mail service? Always something new to learn  ~She",,Springer,"Jan 05, Mon",0
S.M. King,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479936,"Normally I really like analysis, comparison shopping and the like. But this, it's driving me crazy!My tiny studio looks like a gear factory exploded. Not difficult to arrange in less than 200 square feet, lol! At least if I unexpectedly become homeless I can do so in style, yes? Boots. They have been the biggest select, hike, set aside, repeat item. And they are pricey, even on sale. Good thing I am going to live in the woods later and can use the thru-hike rejections or I might get an online-returns rep to beat the band.Then there is food. Why are there so many decisions to make about the simplest way of living I'll experience since I was born? But last night it all came together briefly. It is the first time I loaded my pack the way I presume I'll actually pack it, with real usable items, stepped out in boots that didn't hurt my feet, rub my pre-existing blisters more painfully, and the air had a tinge of briskness to it. YEAH! My poor pup doesn't know if he's died and gone to walk-a-thon heaven or if I am simply dragging him past 10,000 scents he didn't know he was missing out on.I covered the most ground the quickest (with the dog in tow) last night and it all felt right. Now I am anxious to get out for a week's worth of real field testing, learn my gear, and build my knowledge base.And, to stop having my neighbors think I'm daft, running about in a headlamp cooking on an Esbit, and sleeping in a mummy bag when the temps nudge below 50 degrees :D",,Springer,"Jan 07, Wed",0
S.M. King,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480203,"Baseline for Fun!Took a small tenner weekend day hike for a baseline measure this weekend. It was rushed and then delayed, so I did not get the early start that I aimed for. Still it was a good outing.Although I did not carry what all I will begin with for the winnowing out to bearable weight, it was still a full pack load as I wanted the practice. The day warmed up much more than anticipated, so I was glad for the change of clothes. Flat trails are no comparison to the AT topography, but we have to practice where we can!Lessons learned:I hike far hotter than I thought. Cannot imagine ever wanting long sleeves until it is very cool and/or lotsa bugs.Arms being hot are a bigger heat impact than legs for me Merino wool is now my best friend. Cotton is not.Always take more than one firestarting method even on a day hike, in case you are remiss and leave said method in the car at the trailhead :/Trails are full of chatty people!Trail maintainers are super nice and friendly.Work calling you is a huge annoyance on the trail, on a Sunday no less.Don't walk past a trail sign if you don't know what it means. Save yourself some backtracking at the moment of ""Duh! I am off the trail!"" and take note.Blazes are often farther apart than expected. Look behind for clues you are still in the right place.It is difficult to enjoy scenery when you are looking at your feet for roots and snakes. Everyone on the trail isn't trying to set a baseline, make miles, or get from Point A to Point B for a time estimate. Some are out there just having fun. Don't get irritated at them Don't pre-flavor all of your potable water if you'd like to cook with some of it (durrrr) and don't expect there to always be water where the map says it will be. Glad I carried it, even if it was flavoredHaving short arms sucks. I can't reach around my pack for anything other than the water pockets. And I don't want to be clanging along with everything hanging off the 'biner spaces either. Will have to think on this.Taking the phone in and out of pocket to take photos was annoying. Looking into a chest mount thing.Overall I am happy with the day, despite being far too hot and having to eat just cold food. Nothing was sore except the bottoms of my feet, like I had danced all night on concrete. Still, I was recovered fine for heels the next day at work. Already planning where I will go this weekend. Closer to home, less 'hiker' oriented, but also free. Tent arrived. It is heavier than I expected even though I read the weight. While I am in no way aiming for an ultralight experience, it still may be too heavy. Will set it up this weekend as well, to see what the difficulty level is, at the end of hiking, when I am most likely to be tired and more 'all thumbs' than usual. And that's it for now! ~She",,Springer,"Jan 14, Wed",0
S.M. King,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480539,"Like documenting my journey so far ahead of the actual first step, gear testing seemed absurd and so was only discussed quietly with others as enamored with this journey as I. Glad I am doing it though, as I am learning a lot.Last night we had sustained gale force winds and 2.5 inches of rain. So what do I do? Pitch my new tent of course and sleep in it. Well, let me rephrase...ATTEMPT to sleep in it, lol. Trying to simulate near norms as possible, I waited until after dark and impending rain was approaching and winds were whipping. Initially couldn't even get it pitched and damaged a pole in the process (will contact manuf to see what's possible). Rain hit, went inside, re-tried. Success! Threw in my sleeping pad and bag, flashlight and water and crawled in. Commence downpour. Here is where it got tricky for me, new to single person lightweight tents. Lesson in ""how to close vents in a rain deluge"" began in earnest. You can do it from inside the tent and only get your arm wet, btw. However, with no instructions on vent shutting, I erred. I had been getting some drips, hence the initial closing. The inanity of me having them open to begin with probably should best be left undiscussed, but it seemed a bit stuffy in there with the fly on. No instructions came with the fly that I have found, and I didn't close them correctly. After a sudden microburst that sent metal flying and the 200 lb umbrella and stand careening into the awning of my apartment, I retreated inside to stop shaking and dry off. Even the lightning hadn't been that frightening. I dried off, got something to nosh on, and returned to the tent around 2:50 am. (gonna be dumb, must be tough!) The rain dwindled to a pleasant pattering drizzle and I crashed. Only to wake up at 5:30 a.m. sleeping in a very internally dry and warm externally wet sponge, also known as my sleeping bag - and with water dripping into my face. Disgusted, tired and wet, I retreated to my warm and cozy (dry) bed inside. Sunrise came far too early, but I went out and tried to assess why such a stellar-rated tent had failed me so miserably. There were puddles in the far corner, water under the sleeping pad and wet abounded. To put it bluntly, it was user error. Good thing to learn here, where I could adequately dry my bag (which provided excellent protection I might add), dry the tent, fiddle with the ridge vents and determine it was me and not the tent at fault. Much better to learn that now than on the trail or on my trip next month. Everything is now dried, properly set up and ready for another night's try. No rain forecast at all, but the wind is still pretty wild, lifting the dropped ceiling tiles of my studio with amazing piano key-like regularity. Last weekend's day hike was much better than the previous week's as far as temperatures go, but there was much too much water. It made for a good boot dryness test, which they passed with flying colors. Another day with no blisters too, always a good thing. I've changed to icebreaker thin hiker socks and I have a nice callous where the Han Wag's I was previously using inflicted such torture at the heel. I love my Karrimor's and ordered a second pair for any anticipated blowouts on the trail. I'd love to try trail runners, but at my age I feel that I need the ankle protection and support. These boots are terrific and fit my weird foot (wide bridged, high arched, narrow heeled) so comfortably. The Pella rain gear was just too darn heavy (might keep for the farm) so I am switching it out for Marmot. Cut 2.5 lbs from pack weight just with that change. Funny, my pocketbook feels lighter too...hmm. Not really, I found some excellent sales and saved quite a bit from straight retail. Very, very pleased with my Thermarest bag, since it was wet outside and still kept me dry and comfortable internally. I did discover that rain plus hard ground equals hello Vitamin I this morning. However, I don't anticipate sleeping on concrete while on the trail either, hah! Due to this anomaly from trail condisions, I'm using a double pad tonight.Planning a day hike to the beach tomorrow since rain threat is past and it looks to be a cool and clear day. And so the fun and anticipation continues...~She",,Springer,"Jan 24, Sat",0
S.M. King,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/510192,"So, I've changed the year I'm hiking due to:a) Upcoming surgeryb) Relocationc) BudgetingI so, SO wanted it to be 2016, but I have to be reasonable and go when I should be most poised for successful completion. That could change if the corporate merger we just experienced doesn't fall out right I suppose too It is frustrating, but it also gives me more time to practice, improve my gear choices, and heal fully from having my head cut open 0_0I've not updated much due to moving, lack of internets at home, workload at the J.O.B and struggling to come to terms with having to change future plans yet once again. I think I am on plan 5,297 since my husband died almost six years ago. Heat and hiking are not my friends, so I've not hiked since the heat returned in spades and I am looking very much forward to the Fall weather so that I can resume practicing, take some trips to more 'trail-like' areas, and generally get back outside. I am simply a heat wussy. Throw me in the cold and I'm good, but in the heat, not so much. Right now the floodwaters also have the skeeters hanging out in clouds too. Other than these minor challenges, I hope to continue on path.Till next time!~She",,Bah!,"Aug 15, Sat",0
