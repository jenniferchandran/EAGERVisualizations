Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516365,"Well, the first visit to Amicalola Falls State Park and I was hooked on this adventure. The fall leaves were changing and the colors were amazing. I have been preparing for this hike all year; reading books, trail journals and buying the ultra light gear and trying to feel comfortable enough to let the world know I was ready to do this March 2016 thru-hike.
Being from Florida and an avid hiker, I was not prepared for the steep ups and downs that immediately made my calves burn. I guess it's 45 degree tread mill time to help ease the pain. Other than the calves, it was an amazing experience that left me with the desire to continue my preparation and training.",,The Adventure Begins,"Oct 26, Mon",0
Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516410,"Thanks for reading my trail journal. For those of you new to the Appalachian Trail, here is a nice overview that I copied and pasted from some other trail journals. I hope this introduction will spark the desire to learn more about this amazing trail and all it has to offer. The Appalachian Trail is one of the longest continuously marked footpath in the world, measuring roughly 2,180 miles in length. The Trail goes through fourteen states along the crests and valleys of the Appalachian mountain range from the southern terminus at Springer Mountain, Georgia, to the Trail’s northern terminus at Katahdin, Maine.Known as the “A.T.,” it has been estimated that 2-3 million people visit the Trail every year and about 1,800–2,000 people attempt to “thru-hike” the Trail. People from across the globe are drawn to the A.T. for a variety of reasons: to reconnect with nature, to escape the stress of city life, to meet new people or deepen old friendships, or to experience a simpler life.The A.T. was completed in 1937 and is a unit of the National Park System. The A.T. is managed under a unique partnership between the public and private sectors that includes, among others, the National Park Service (NPS), the USDA Forest Service (USFS), an array of state agencies, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, and 31 local Trail-maintaining clubs.Fun Facts•The Trail is roughly 2,180 miles long, passing through 14 states.•Thousands of volunteers contribute roughly 220,000 hours to the A.T. every year.•More than 250 three-sided shelters exist along the Trail.•Virginia is home to the most miles of the Trail (about 550), while West Virginia is home to the least (about 4).•Maryland and West Virginia are the easiest states to hike; New Hampshire and Maine are the hardest.•The total elevation gain of hiking the entire A.T. is equivalent to climbing Mt. Everest 16 times.•The A.T. is home to an impressive diversity of plants and animals. Some animals you may see include black bears, moose, porcupines, snakes, woodpeckers, and salamanders. Some plants you may encounter include jack-in-the-pulpit, skunk cabbage, and flame azalea.Hikers•About 2 to 3 million visitors walk a portion of the A.T. each year.•The A.T. has hundreds of access points and is within a few hours drive of millions of Americans, making it a popular destination for day-hikers.•“Thru-hikers” walk the entire Trail in a continuous journey. “Section-hikers” piece the entire Trail together over years. “Flip-floppers” thru-hike the entire Trail in discontinuous sections to avoid crowds, extremes in weather, or start on easier terrain.•1 in 4 who attempt a thru-hike successfully completes the journey•Most thru-hikers walk north, starting in Georgia in spring and finishing in Maine in fall, taking an average of 6 months.•Foods high in calories and low in water weight, such as Snickers bars and Ramen Noodles, are popular with backpackers, who can burn up to 6,000 calories a day.•Hikers usually adopt “trail names” while hiking the Trail. They are often descriptive or humorous. Examples are “Eternal Optimist,” “Thunder Chicken,” and “Crumb-snatcher"".",,The Appalachian Trail,"Oct 27, Tue",0

Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517394,"What a great weekend for hiking. The weather here in Florida turned cool, (77 degrees). So Saturday with full pack, poles and my daughter in tow we hiked the Little-Big Econ State Forest, Florida Trail for 8 miles, then on Sunday I ventured out with my hiking buddy Bob and we hiked the Hal Scott Preserve. The yellow and white loops, checking out the campsites for a few overnights in the near future. We went about 10 miles and cooked some lunch on the trail with our Jetboils. Feeling great and still counting down to the big day in March.",,View Entry,"Nov 15, Sun",0
Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518516,"Did the Vollksmark trail hike with my hiking buddy Bob from the start of the Wekiva Springs and followed the white blazes for 14.1 miles loop. It's the longest hike to date with full backpack, but it felt good and I survived. We took a refeshing dip in the 72 degree spring and it was really enjoyable. This entry is a test with the mobile setup to see if it works. Anyone have any thoughts on lightweight battery options? What setup do you use for your mobile to keep it charged?",,Wekiwa Springs,"Dec 19, Sat",0
Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519532,"Hiked again with my hiking buddy Bob, who has committed to start out with me on the trail in March. We spent the day hiking along the Florida Trail in Seminole County, did about 12 miles in anticipation of the 40 mile hike over the upcoming holiday weekend. We are going to hike the Withlacoochee State Forest Citrus Perimeter Loop for 2 nights and do a through shakedown of all our gear that we will be taking on the AT. I will update all the gear and review when we get back.",,The Florida Trail,"Jan 12, Tue",0
Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519780,"What an adventure, we hiked over 36 miles in 3 days on the Citrus Perimeter Loop at Withlacoochee State Forest for our first shakedown hike in anticipation for the AT. We encounter all sorts of weather, trail topography, fire and animals. The gear I was using and listed on my journal seemed to work excellent, I weighed in at 23 pounds at the start and realized on day 2 that I probably could have shaved a few more pounds,(especially with some food items). Which I will figure out over the next month to get down to around 20 pounds. We hiked most of the second day in the rain, cold and than we had the introductory chore of hanging our clothes by the fire, Yes I didn't put my rain pants on and realized that was a big mistake. The trail was awesome and on a few occasions we were able to explore some cave systems, which was so COOL... So now its back to tweaking gear, strength training, and walking more miles till the big day arrives. See you on the trail...............Lee",,Citrus Loop Trail,"Jan 17, Sun",0
Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523358,Well the countdown continues. I presume I packed everything 4 or 5 times and I was able to keep my pack weight around the 22 pound mark with 5 days of food. Will be heading to the trail this time next week and can't wait to take my first steps. Good luck to all who have ventured out so far and I will see you on the Trail.....,,View Entry,"Mar 13, Sun",0
Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524312,"Amicalola Falls and LodgeBob and I were like to two giddy children as we drove to the start of our adventure. We detoured and spent some time with my daughter in Atlanta. Then our dream of the hike has finally turned into reality. I would like to thank our spouses for driving us here and supporting the journey. I would really like to be a fly on the wall on their return trip home. We arrived at Amicalola Falls State Park and were greeted by some snow flurries as we checked into the lodge and proceeded to our cabin. Today we plan on doing some sightseeing and activities around the park including registering and walking up the falls. We did the first portion of the approach trail, which was 1000 feet up in the first mile. So after the excitement of the trip, the long car ride and months of planning the journey we will begin in the morning with the first real steps.",,The Lodge,"Mar 21, Mon",0
Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524706,"Day 1Well the day has finally arrived and the weather was perfect to this start this epic journey. We left our cabin and headed over to Amicalola Falls Lodge for breakfast. We enjoyed the awesome view from our table as we discussed the last minute details. The thoughts of the unknown, the exhilaration, the adrenaline rush were all present as I adjusted my backpack said goodbye to my supportive wife and took my first steps on the trail. As Bob and I made our way up up up the never ending mountain I was amazed at the beauty and in awe of the surroundings. The pre hikes in Florida were like standing still compared to the grueling long up hills we faced today. Not to mention the steep rock scrambling downhills. We shuffled taking the lead most of the morning until we made it to Springer Mountain, the official starting point of the Appalachian Trail. Here we meet John from Las Vegas and we pushed on together to the Stover Creek Shelter. We did an 11.6 miles day with only 2.8 official Appalachian Trail miles.We had a blast at the shelter, and there were at least 25 tents set up. We talked and laughed with John and a few others plus a couple girls from Maine who were very entertaining and interesting. It's hiker midnight now 8:00pm. First goal completed: we hiked the 8.8 mile approach trail to the start of the AT. The mileage doesn't count towards the Appalachian trail totals but it was worth all the pain and effort if was absolutely beautiful and challenging. I am safe and warm, until tomorrow..","Springer Mountain

Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524711,"Day 2We awoke to the sunrise at Stover Creek and quickly packed up and headed to Long Creek Falls for breakfast. It was the highlight to a grueling day. This Appalachian trail is NO JOKE, it's rocky, rooty, slick, it's steep and slippery and it's decent is even worse. It has elevation changes without warning and it fools your mental fitness with the false summits. We did over 10 miles today, climbed and descended 3 mountains with Sassafras really kicking my butt with its steep ups and straight down decent. It was around 3400 feet and if you forget about the pain we did have some incredible views, cool rock ledges and we walked for miles along rhododendron tunnels along the creeks. Tonight we are beat but did tent along Justus Creek in a great stealth camp site. Bob just hung the bear bag and we soaked our sore feet in the creek so now it off to bed at 7:30. Still before hiker midnight. Lol I am safe and warm, until tomorrow....","Stover Creek Shelter

Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524715,"Day 3It was so refreshing sleeping next to Justus Creek, the sound of the rushing waters made me sleep like a baby. We were up, ate and all packed by sunrise and headed off down the trail. We arrived at Gooch Gap and were treated to some Trail magic from a previous thru hiker. I wolfed down 3 chocolate donuts and the sugar rushed carried me up and over Ramrock Mountain at 3200 feet. We stopped at Woody Gap for lunch and we saw a lot of familiar faces that we have been leap frogging with the last 2 days. We meet Rainbow Express on the climb to Preaching Rock, he thru hiked the trail in 1980 and is doing it again. The weather called for afternoon rain so we hiked to Henry Gap, set up camp and are getting ready for our big push tomorrow to Neels Gap Mountain Crossing, but we need to climb Blood Mountain in the morning at 4457 feet before we get there. We have a cabin rented and are looking forward to a shower.
I am safe, warm and wet. Until tomorrow....","Justus Creek

Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524853,"Day 4It was a very windy, wet and cold morning. I woke up just before sunrise and almost stayed in the warm sleeping bag. I hit the trail at daybreak and didn't see anyone all morning till Woods Hole Shelter. I stopped at Slaughter Creek Spring to fill up with water and meet a group of spring breakers from Florida getting ready to climb the infamous Blood Mountain. Also Bob caught up to me so we filled our water bottles and proceeded up Blood Mountain together. Blood mountain at 4457 feet is the tallest mountain in Georgia on the Appalachian Trail. Some believe that the name of the mountain comes from a bloody battle between the Cherokee and Creek Indians. The ascend to the top was strenuous and worth the effort to see the beautiful views in all directions. We had lunch on top with all different people and discuss the beauty of the mountain. We explored the old stone shelter built in 1920 and the surrounding areas. It was quite a treat. We made our way down the mountain, all grueling 2.2 miles with an elevation drop of almost 1500 feet. We arrived a Neel Gap and Mountain Crossings Outfitter. We walked a quarter mile to Blood Mountain Cabins and checked in and staying at the Mountain Lion Cabin with an excellent view. John from Las Vegas has been hiking with Bob and I and will be staying with us. It's time for some NCAA basketball, then back on the trail tomorrow. I am warm safe and full tonight on the delicious pizza from Blood mountain resort.","Henry Gap

Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524972,"Day 5Our stay last night at Blood Mountain Cabins and Country Store was delightful, the owners were great, the pizza's were perfect and they had an awesome shower too. I would highly recommend these accommodations.  Left the cabin and swung by Neels Gap, Neels Gap is where more than 25% of thru hikers who start the Appalachian Trail QUIT..... So I am headed up up up the ridge for another glorious day of hiking.  Second Goal Completed...Hike out of Neels Gap.....We pasted Cowrock Mountain, Wolf Laurel Top and Tensatee Gap all with beautiful vistas with amazing views. We climbed Wildcat Mountain with a 500 foot ascend in a half a mile, it was straight up and exhausting. Once we arrived at Hogpen Gap we were treated to an amazing act of kindness by the Echo Ministries from Atlanta, Georgia with trail magic of hot dogs, cheeseburgers, drinks, fruit, etc,etc, etc. With 2 dogs and a cheeseburger plus an assortment of chocolate including mint Oreos and other desserts. I power forward with full belly to Low Gap Shelter. The tent is up, belly is full and I am safe and dry....until tomorrow.","Neel Gap

Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525133,"Day 6Well it rained all night and the temperature dropped into the low 40's so I awoke before daylight, cold and to the pitter padder of the rain. I started to pack my gear in the dark. Once dressed and layered up for the day, I than added my rain gear and headlamp and made my way over to the bear bag cable in the dark. I didn't realize that there were so many campers here but I counted over 20 bags in this one spot. I retrieved my bag and went back to my cold and wet tent to eat breakfast. I also dropped Bobs bear bag off at his tent and told him I was taking off at daylight. Just before daylight I packed my wet tent up and added it to the backpack and set off in the rain with my headlamp shinning. It was an great morning to be hiking in the rain, the first 4 or 5 miles were on an old logging road with numerous springs for water. There were absolutely no views today as we were above 3000 feet and were fogged in. It felt like I was in the Blair Witch movie. Once the trail veered off the logging road it became difficult as we cut across mountains like mountain goats. The terrain was so rocky and slick and we just kept going up up up than back down a little just to head back up. I finally crested the top of Blue Mountain at over 4000 feet in the pouring rain. It did not stop raining all day. Well it was a tough climb up but the decent was toughest with the wet rocks, slick mud, and tangle roots. Bob and I took it slow and steady and when we finally made it down to Unicoi Gap there was a thru hiker and his family throwing a trail magic Easter Brunch. The was ham, baked beans, potato salad, plus much much more. I want to thank them again and again. It was so awesome coming off the slick mountain to find tents and food. We made it to Unicoi gap by 1PM so we banged out 9.6 miles in the rain and decided to accept a ride from Wonder Boy into Helen Georgia for the night. Wonder Boy hiked the whole trail in 2012 and received his trail name because everyone always said. Boy: I wonder if you will ever make it to the end. We checked in downtown Helen and dried out all our stuff at the hotel. There has been a steady stream of hikers checking in and we are having fun hanging out and being dry. We have decided to take our first Zero Day tomorrow in Helen. Which really means we get a day off from hiking and I can rest my sore body. Did I say I have pain in places I didn't even know I had. Lol. I am finally dry and warm, until tomorrow......","Low Gap Shelter

Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525218,"Day 7. Zero DayWe took our first Zero Day in Helen Georgia. It was supposed to be a day of rest and relaxation. We ended up walking around the town and eating at all different places. Basically, we turned into tourists and had an awesome day exploring. Helen was formerly a logging town that was in decline, the city resurrected itself by becoming a replica of a Bavarian alpine town, in the Appalachians instead of the Alps. It has charm, charisma and lots of friendly folks who go out of their way to make you feel at home. So it's way past hiker midnight and we are packing up in anticipation of our ride to the trail bright and early tomorrow morning. I am full, tired and sore from my first zero day. Until tomorrow........","Unicoi Gap

Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525329,"Day 8We awoke and had breakfast at the Huddle House and right at 7am our driver John from Hiker's Shuttle Service arrived and dropped us off at Unicoi Gap. It was a tough day with three climbs over 4000 feet, first Rocky Mountain with some awesome views. Than Trey Mountain at 4430 feet with a few views and last Kelly Knob with the trail following the ridge with great views. We arrived at Deep Gap Shelter around 5 pm and set up camp. After our Zero Day in Helen we lost our bubble of hikers and our now meeting other groups who have hiked together so it's been an interesting day. I hiked with Bushwacker for a while today. We pushed out our best hiking day at over 13 miles and I am still hiking with Bob, and John from Vegas. We will be at the Top of Georgia Hostel around noon tomorrow to pick up our resupply boxes, so it's up in the air whether we will stay or move on. I hear the owner Sir Packs A Lot is quite the character, we met him briefly at Woody Gap a few days ago. I am tired, full and ready for bed. Until tomorrow......","Helen, Georgia

Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525449,"Day 9. Nero DayWe arrived at the Top of Georgia Hostel around 11 AM. It was a very cold and windy walk up and down the mountains this morning. The highlights were an amazing view of Lake Chatugue from Powell Mountain Vista and the long walk along Dicks Creek with the sounds of rushing water and a few beautiful waterfalls. It's was not a big mileage day, it is what you call a Nero Day, very few miles hiked. We were scheduled to resupply with the box of items we had shipped. Plus Bob and I had some work items we needed to address and John was still having calf issues. So we decided to stay in town for the night, catch up, eat a few good meals and hit the trail tomorrow. The only schedule is to be at the NOC for the Trail Magic Festival April 8-9. Which should be an easy goal and than the following week we should be halfway thru the Smokies. Happy to be in a real bed tonight, real food and heat. Until tomorrow........","Deep Gap Shelter

Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525646,"Day 10. Zero DayWell today was an unplanned Zero Day, we awoke at the hotel to a cold rainy morning with a bleak forecast. So we decided to call it a work day since it was the last day of the month and quarter. I was in touch with the office and clients most of the day. We did sneak out to the all you eat buffet for $8 at the Georgia Mountain Cafe which was a better deal than Daniels all you can eat buffet at $9, which we tried last night.   Not only was the food better, but we saved a buck. The hotel is full of hikers getting out of the rain and we are telling our trail stories around the jacuzzi as we soak our sore and tired bodies. We visited Bacchus Beer and Growlers and tried a sampling of their seasonal mountain taps. I would recommend a stop here, very friendly and knowledgeable. It's funny to see a big hiker box in the lobby of the Holiday Inn. The boxes are where hikers discard their extra or heavy stuff and other hikers can go thru the box and get what they need. Usually at resupply stops the boxes are full of extra food and it's tough climbing out of a gap with a heavy backpack full of unwanted food items. We are all packed up and will be escorted back to the mountain in the morning by John from the Hikers Shuttle Service. We plan on a 3 day hike into Franklin, N.C. for our next stop and resupply.","Dicks Creek Gap, Hiawassee GA

We proceeded to get in our rain gear and off we went, up up up the steep wet muddy trail. We climbed over 1000 feet over Coward Gap to Buzzard Knob. It was so foggy there were no views in any directions. The trail was so muddy it was like being in an ice rink and trying to stand with no skates. You had to be extra careful not to slide off the ledge on the steep declines. We passed the Georgia and North Carolina State Line and we were immediately presented with another tough, butt kicking 1000 foot climb to 4800 feet, our tallest summit yet. We covered the 6 miles at over 4000 feet doing the pointless ups and downs (PUD) dance and arrived at Muskrat Creek Shelter. We were reunited with John as we caught up to him after our Zero. There were about 40 of us here tonight with a few familiar faces.Bob and I are getting very creative in the preparation of our freeze dry dinners. Tonight we had Mountain House Beef Mac and Cheese, we added freeze dry green beans and instant mashed potatoes, mixed it up and had a successful great tasting dinner. I am safe, warm and drying out. Looks like someone has just hung their bear bag real close to my tent, maybe I am not that safe. Lol.","Dick Creek Gap, Hiawassee GA

I left Muskrat Creek a little after sun up and within a few hours and a 300 foot elevation drop, I arrived in Deep Gap and was treated to trail magic of pancakes and sausage. It was an awesome treat considering last night and this morning the temps were in the low 30's. Plus the trail was still slick from some overnight showers.I climbed Standing Indian Mountain and summited at 5435 feet to some awesome views and then it was downhill for the rest of the day. We made Carter Gap around 3 and didn't want to push to the next shelter, we were both exhausted. We had to get ready for an overnight monster storm with temperatures in the low 20's and sustained winds of 25-35 with gusts up to 65mph. Bob and I found 2 tent spots somewhat protected by smaller bushes and the ground was flat. We put our tents up and fortified them with stick stakes and extra cord. Let's hope it enough. I am cold, bundled and hoping my tent doesn't blow away......until tomorrow.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

It was still windy and cold when we left camp this morning and our water bottles had ice in them. We passed a few great views but it was to cold to linger, until just passed Mooney Gap. The view was one of our best to date, so we took some photos then moved on. Then we started up Albert Mountain. Maybe they should call it Sir Albert. It was a beast, almost 800 feet and the last 400 was a hand over hand crawl. When we hit the summit at 5250, there was a fire tower on top which we also climbed. Also after summiting Albert we hit the official 100 MILE MARK on the Appalachian Trail, not including the 8.6 miles for the approach trail. We quickly pushed thru the last 6 miles of roots, rocks, streams etc, to Rock Gap and called a shuttle to take us to Franklin N.C. for another rest day and town food.

YES, the trail is brutal and any step my be your last. You must constantly look down and plan almost every step or else you can turn an ankle, break a leg or fall off a ledge and that's not exaggerating. It's amazing that a change in altitude can make all the difference. It's a beautiful sunny spring day here at the hotel and I am lounging around in the sun having an awesome day off. But I am still making office calls so it's all good. We are planning an evening of social events at the Lazy Hiker Brewing Company to catch up with some trail buddies. Bushwacker and Yacky have made it down the mountain and that should be some added entertainment this evening. The beard is coming along nicely and the kids want me to keep it. The wife is now calling me Santa Clause. I am sure the office staff will get a kick out it when I get back. I would like to thank my spouse, my children, my office staff and especially my loyal clients for the opportunity to embark on such an adventure. I will cherish these moments on the trail forever.

We watched the final Game of March Madness and hit the hay well after hiker midnight. We were picked up by the hiker shuttle at 9AM and were soon back on the trail heading for out next destination at NOC which is about 30 miles or so. We plan on arriving Thursday and staying for the big hiker bash on Friday. It was a long day filled with 2 strenuous climbs and than 2 beautiful views. We are now climbing BALDS, which are cleared out sections of land on top of mountains so that you have 360 degrees of pararamic views. The first was Siler Bald at 5228 feet and than Wayah Bald at 5342 with an excellent stone tower and lots of historical facts surrounding the Bald and park. We passed today Winding Stair Gap, Swing Lick Gap, Panther Gap and as we approached and passed each the weather became colder and colder. We missed our Campsite at the top of Wine Spring Road and had to hike an additional 2.4 miles to the next shelter as we could not find a descent stealth site. When we arrived it was almost dark and all the level spots were taken. It was a cold, cold evening of sliding off my air mattress. The 14.8 mile day took its toll on our bodies and Bob and I skipped dinner and went right to bed after we set up our tents. The temperature was below freezing again and that didn't help for a getting a good night of sleep or hanging around the shelter fire. I am cold, tired and hungry......Until Tomorrow.","Franklin NC

So at sun up I was dressed and leaving camp, I wanted to get warm and the only way was to walk, so there I was walking in the freezing cold at 7 AM trying to warm up with every piece of clothes I had in my backpack on. I meet a father and daughter as I approached Cold Springs Shelter and they said they were hiking a short day and we're going to stay at Nantahala Mountain Lodge and were being picked up at Tellico Gap at 1 PM. About a mile later I had 1 bar of reception and called the lodge and rented a cabin for Bob and I. I finally reach Bob and I told him of my executive decision of the warm cabin, shower, food and told himself to step it up that our ride would be there soon and he was a mile behind us. He was as cold and miserable as I was from our long day yesterday. So after just a little over 8 freezing cold miles today by 1pm. I can barely remember the excellent views from Licklock Gap, Burningtown Gap, Cooper Ridge Bald and Rocky Bald as I am just starting to feel my numb hands and feet. We were picked up and transported back in time as we ended up at the Nantahala Mountain Lodge. The Lodge was run by Wiggy a 2010 Appalachian Trail Thru Hiker and his wife. They are an English couple with the best British accents and treat you like royalty. It's a down town Abby feel and once you arrive they give you the Royal Treatment for sure. Once in the shower they give you clothes and wash all your hiker stuff, the lodge is immaculate and the breakfast and dinners are home cooked and delicious. It is highly recommended that you stay here if you are ever in the area. Once we thawed out in our cabin and ate our delicious 3 course meal of slow roasted pork and homemade mashed potatoes. Not to mention the supreme Pizza we wolfed down upon arrival. Bob and I were happy to be in a warm place for the evening as the weather outside called for freezing rain all night. I am warm, full and content.....Until Tomorrow.","Wayah Bald Shelter

Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526899,"Day 17After a great breakfast, Steve from Nantahala Mountain Lodge dropped us off at Tellico Gap. We had a short day into the NOC with so many great views and so much in elevation changes. The trail was its usual self with rocks, boulders, branches, roots, sticks, twigs and anything else that could make you trip and fall. We started out at 3800 feet up to almost 5000 at Wesser Bald and than finishing up at 1700 feet at the NOC. It was wet, slippery and cold at the higher elevations But as we went to lower levels, spring was in the air. The trees were spouting green buds, the array of all different color flower arrangements in the hillside made us feel like we moved from winter to spring in just a few hours of downhill hiking. We reached the jump off view at 3900 feet and it was spectacular, it is what this adventure is all about. We leapfrogged with the father and daughter team all the way down the mountain today and into NOC.We reached the NOC or Nantahala Outdoor Center around 1:30 and made our way to the River's End Restaurant where we ordered appetizers of trout cakes and the famous hiker burgers. We indulged in some suds and discussed the awesome complex of the NOC which is a world class rafting and kayaking facility. We checked into our cabin an than we talked with some familiar hikers about the upcoming events tomorrow at the annual Trail Magic Festival. We expect to be grilling steaks tomorrow on our cabin deck as we listen to music and enjoy the festivities. Yacky and Bushwacker should arrive at the cabin tomorrow so there will be added entertainment.","Tellico Gap

Lee ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527018,"Conclusion To those who have read and followed me on my journal I want to Thank You for being part of my adventure. It has been an eye opening experience and one I will never forget. The volunteers who have spent hours maintaining and keeping the trail in pristine condition are the heroes of this story. They have made this experience much better than I would have ever hoped. My hat is off to all of you on a exceptional job well done. To any followers of the journal, the Appalachian Trail is addicting and I would recommend that you give it a try. It will change your perspective on life, love and happiness. Whether it's the beautiful scenery, the challenging environment, the companionship one finds with strangers on trail or just the mental solitude of nature. It's is just a fantastic journey that will test all your abilities good and bad. I want to thank all who have made this excursion possible for me. It is one I will cherish daily as my mind wonders back to the trail and my heart is filled with joy. It is now time for me to return to the real world of the hustle and bustle and I feel I will be a better person to all because of my walk in the woods. I am leaving this adventure on my own terms, there is no injury, no feeling of discontent, it's just that at this point in my life I miss the rat race, the stock markets, current news and events and most of all I miss my FAMILY and friends. I would rather spend my time in the real world now and daydream of adventure. I look forward to my next section hike of this magnificent trail whenever it may be. I hope when the time arrives I will see you on the trail or find you reading my journal again. Thanks again, I still have that little boy smile as I think of the trail and will continue to have as the weeks, months and years pass. I am content, joyful and smiling....Until next time.","NOC
