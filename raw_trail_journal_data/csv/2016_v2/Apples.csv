Apples,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539450,"Today me and my dad left our house in Burnsville MN, at around two AM. We spent around 13 hours on the road, switching off driving. We stopped at an Illinois and Indiana to take pictures. The thing about me and my dad is that when we are in the same car we get deep into conversation. This factor made the drive seem hotel, and made it more enjoyable. After getting to the hotel we ate dinner, hung out and started going through our packs again, preparing for Friday when we start the trail.","Burnsville, Minnesota

Apples,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539458,"Today, we woke up around 6:30 and enjoyed a nice hot breakfast at the Country Inn and Suites in Georgetown Virginia. We left the hotel aroun 7:30 and headed to the TRI-Cities airport in Kingsport I believe. Once we got there, which was around 12 we grabbed a bite and waited for our shuttle. Our shuttle was just a car, just us and a older man named Matt. Matt was super nice and somewhat the highlight of my day. He took us the back way to Damascus through the mountains. It was so beautiful I couldn't take my our of the window. The dips, the trees and the creeks. We actually went by a part of the trail which was pretty cool. We got to Damascus around 2 ish and walked around a little. We grabbed our packs and checked in at the Hikers Inn. The Hikers Inn is somewhat like a house, that was just turned into an Inn. The guy who ran it was named Paul, we was absent most of the time but when he was there we was very friendly. We sat outside for a while and we got to meet this couple Buzz and Ingrid. They were very friendly and we spoke for about an hour and then another hour or so after dinner. Buzz thru hiked last year, and his wife Ingrid joined in for a day or two, a couple times. Meeting them made our stay a lot more delightful. After a nice, last shower, me and my dad were off to bed. We had to get to bed, because we start the trail tomorrow.","Damascus Virginia

Apples,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539981,"This morning we started our day out by eating breakfast at Mojos in Damascus. That was really good. I highly recommend it. When we started on the trail it seemed quite calm at first but we very quickly ran into uphill. Lots and lots of uphill. I have to admit, I wasn't ready and I was going slow. The whole hike was pretty hard personally, mostly because I'm not as in shape as I should be. We stopped for a break around 6 miles at this really pretty creek and that was a nice sight. About 4 miles later we stopped at Saunders mountain shelter and ate lunch. That was nice, we laid back on the shelter and just kind of stood at the ceiling because why not. It was also interesting to see what people wrote on the walls, and in the log book. After that, we hiked about 3 ish miles to our last stop for the night. We first just sat down and rested because we aren't really used to this yet. We have been camping so so much, but the hiking treacherous mountains with a 28 pound pack.... Not so much. We were hoping to get to lost mountain shelter but I told my dad that I wanted to stop for the night. Both my legs and my feet hurt. Although I do have to say, despite the tiredness and pain I would do it again just for the beautiful views. Hoping for a better day tomorrow as we plan to hike 16 miles.","The Hikers Inn
",Camp,"Jun 24, Fri",13
Apples,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539982,"Today started out pretty rough, for some odd reason my motivation went away. I didn't wanna hike and I hated it. Around 11 ish I got that motivation back which was really nice. In the morning, both me and my dad didn't think we would make it to the shelter because I was tired and hurting. We had hike about 5 use miles at this point. We then got to this huge (what felt like never ending) uphill. No breaks, just hill. Now that was hard, we took it slowly with small, quick stops. We took a longer break after a good mile of that. Two more miles to go. We hiked and hiked and finally we got to a less treacherous area. That was nice, and by that time we were pretty close, about a quarter mile later, we could see it. White top. A massive rock at the top of this mountain/hill over looking beautiful landscape. Once we could see it though, the climb got steeper than it had been yet, but this time it was shorter. The view was amazing and about 7/10 of a mile later was a nice spring. We sat at the campsite for the spring and ate lunch. I even fell asleep for a good 5 ish minutes. We then made our way to the shelter, which was six more miles. This part was probably the easiest, it was almost all downhill or flat. We then got to a parking lot for Elk Garden, I believe it was called. That was after two miles. There was a bathroom there. Kind of like a privy but not as smelly and a lot cleaner. We both stopped there and took a little break there. We then started our four mile ascent to the shelter. This wasn't as bad as I presumed but I was already sore and tired so that didn't help. But after what felt like forever we made it, around 6. We got there pretty late but that's okay. We got camp set up, ate, washed up and now I'm off to bed. It was a rough, but also good day. Tomorrow we get to see the horses.","Camp

Apples,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539983,"Today started out pretty good. We entered Gracen Highlands state park pretty quickly. Which meant that we got to see the ponies fairly quickly too. We hiked up and over this ridge, it was up and down with lots of rocks. We had a good amount of fog so that made it cool, but because of it we couldn't see the view. At one point we finally got to see some ponies which was actually too far in. They were super sweet and we fed them apples, but one of the fillys kicked my dad. It got on its front legs and started kicking and whining, it kicked me too. Thankfully we got out of the way fast so it didn't hurt so bad. The beginning of today was nice, out in the open, cool, got to see horses. But once we got back in warm weather and in hilly area it wasn't quite so fun anymore. We went up and down a couple hills and stopped at Wise Shelter which was nice. We took a break and we got to meet to nice ladies. Alison and Kate. They were super nice and we had good conversation. We then proceeded to got up then back down to a Coral. We were gonna stopped for lunch on stone mountain but started descending it before we realized we passed out stop. So we ate lunch at the coral. We met two nice folks there who were on the horse trail. We then proceeded to get to Old Orchard shelter which we also took a break there. Not long after we got there Kate and Alison got there, that was nice because we got to know them. After leaving Old Orchard it was pretty much downhill to the fox creek parking lot. Then we started our 1.5 mile of huge uphill. That was not very fun. Both our feet hurt and such, but after a while we finally got to the shelter. YIPPE! Haha. Once we ate dinner, I threw up a whole bunch, so piece of advice don't over work yourself the first couple days like we did.","Thomas Knob Shelter
",Hurricane Shelter,"Jun 26, Sun",16
Apples,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539984,"Today started and ended at a good pace. It was some down, some up and some flat. It was a nice easier hike. It was cool cause we got to nine miles around 2:30 (we started at 9:30) which was pretty slow but we had a long lunch too. For some odd reason going into town and sleeping in a hotel sounds amazing right now. Probably because I'm sleeping in a tent every night and eating food from a bag. Although the food is pretty good. Anyways, we go into town in two days and I'm kinda hoping we can stay somewhere. I'm not sure my dad would want us to though. We will be able to get laundry and showers, and a breakfast which would be super nice. Either way going into town will be nice. We stayed in a shelter tonight and it's kinda loud cause it's raining and the roof for the shelter is metal. But it's a nice shelter and we don't have to set up or take down a tent which is nice. Not much to say about today, it was pretty calm.","Hurricane Shelter
",Trimpi Shelter,"Jun 27, Mon",9
Apples,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540162,"This morning started okay, I woke up to a mouse chewing something under the floor boards. It wouldn't go near me but I still couldn't sleep until the noise went away. Once it did I got a couple more hours. We were a little slow getting up today. Mostly because we have both been mentally and physically exhausted for the past couples days. The hike started out with a good amount of down and flat, then about two miles in started to go up, up, and up. It wasn't that horrible though. We just weren't expecting it. For lunch we stopped on the side of this gravel road close to the top of a ridge. Our lunch was quite a bit longer than normal because we had service for the first time in days. That was a nice break, and we got to catch up with our social life. We then proceeded to hike 4 miles which actually went by pretty quickly. There was a good amount of uphill, but we were farther along then we thought we were which made getting to the shelter a surprise. We thought we still had a good mile and a half to go and boom, we hit the shelter. That was a good thing that happened. When we got in, we met Snail and his dog Izzy and got to talking to him. We then went to Mount Rogers Visitor Center, which was right around the corner. They had pop and candy bars so that was a really nice treat. When we came back Evenflow was there and that was cool since we met him yesterday. The four of us made good conversation and even ordered a pizza. Again, another nice treat for the day, plus partnership has showers. Our night was very delightful. It was dryer than most nights and we got to have a campfire which was pretty cool. I'm hoping tomorrow is as good.","Trimpi Shelter

Apples,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540323,"Today was a really nice, relaxing day. We woke up a little earlier, packed things up with Snail and Evenflow and went on our way. The trail started with some ups and we realized we didn't have much energy so after about and hour we cooked up some food. I had spaghetti and Sherpa had breakfast skillet. We then went on our way with three hills left. The first one was about .5 miles from our brunch and that one wasn't too bad. It wasn't very long but it was steep. The next one was a bit bigger, but again not very long just more steep. Our last hill was the biggest of all where we climbed up to this ridge. We were expecting that one to be the hardest but it wasn't. It was a lot longer, but it went up more gradually, and had some flat spots. We then proceeded to go down a good amount and then it got really flat. This made the last 6 miles very pleasant and I got to see a kitty once we got into farmland (: It ran off though so I couldn't pet it haha but that's okay. We then finally got into town and arrived at the inn around 2:30. It was a little later then we expected but that's okay. We laid in bed and watched tv and it was such a treat. We also got to have a hot shower, laundry, and eat dinner at a restaurant! It was such a wonderful night. Good day.","Partnership Shelter

Apples,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540324,"Not much to write about today, got to sleep in an actual bed, and had some wifi too! I got to eat lucky charms for breakfast and that was awesome. We packed out packs, which are way heavier because we resupplied, and checked out at 11. We then went up to the Barn restaurant and sat outside waiting for Snail and Evenflow. Snail had his car there and offered us a ride back to the trail. We then camped right where we got dropped off. We had a nice fire, ate some poptarts and went to bed.","Relax Inn

Apples,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540447,"Today we slept in and didn't get out until 9. I was okay with that though, it was hard to get out of bed because I didn't sleep that great last night. Was up coughing, I think being out her gave me a little bug. Anyways, we started out with a heck of a climb. I guess it wasn't horrible but we weren't really expecting it. Once we got to what we would call the top... It was a fairly easy hike. We then proceeded to go down to this parking lot which was about 7 miles in. That downhill hurt my right knee a lot. Which was a bit surprising but at the same time I guess I saw that coming. I started to take that trek a little slower. After the parking lot we stopped for a break. Got some water and had some start burst. I even had some shut eye for like 4 minutes. That was pretty nice haha. After that there was a good mike of uphill, which I have to say was a bit difficult considering we took a 0 day yesterday. Once we got to the top of that it was mostly flat with small ups and downs. The last stretch to the shelter was all down, so by the time we got there my knee was really sore. I spent most of the rest of the night with a brace on it. After we got there we just sat for a good while. We had met Cha Cha and Ducky earlier and they stopped at the shelter. We got to talk to them and a few other people. I ate Nutella and crackers for a snack and that was quite a treat. Then for dinner I had spaghetti and Sherpa had chili mac. We sat for a while and talked to two older men who were at the shelter. I cannot remember there names. One told us all about his shop as a fisherman, which e did for one season a long time ago. This was very interesting and we talked about it for a good half hour. Finally after washing up, brushing hair and teeth I went to bed. Even though it's only quarter after nine. We are hiking to Dismal Falls tomorrow and I hear they are very pretty.","Off trail Campsite

Apples,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540861,"Today was a great day, we woke up a little later (7 a.m.) and ate breakfast and had coffee. Well, Sherpa had coffee, I didn't. We took a long time to get ready but that's because we were talking to Plugger and Grayghost. Plugger had some great stories to tell about work and his life and such. Taking a long time for breakfast was okay since we only had 8 miles to go today. It was a fairly easy hike with only one big uphill. We only took one longish break, and it was like 5 minutes long. The scenery today was absolutely beautiful and we both got some good pictures. We got to Trents grocery which is a bit off trail, around noon which was perfect because they had a tiny little restaurant we could eat lunch at. It wasn't really a restaurant, more just a couple tables and they give you some food on a paper plate. But it was cheap, and it was good homemade food. We thought we were gonna resupply some stuff there, but they didn't exactly have what we needed. After lunch we then proceeded up this gravel road to dismal falls, this trek was up, but still pretty easy. When we got to dismal falls it was really packed. Being a Saturday on 4th of July weekend, it was full of people. We made our towards the more woodsy parts where there were less people. We sat around the falls for a bit then went and set up camp, and got water. When I was getting water, I fell in the river, so I thought that it was getting close to time for a swim. I went and got Sherpa and we went into the freezing cold river. It was kind of like a pool because it was at the bottom of the falls. It was as warm as a pool though, this water was cold. And I mean COLD. Sherpa went in right away but it took me a while before I told him to just pull me in. I then went up to the first level of falls, and just sat there. I let it rain on me and I put my head under it too, to kinda get a shower on my hair. That was still cold but a lot nicer. That was after Sherpa went back to camp. Then I went back to camp, changed, and started dinner. Actually Sherpa started the water. We made cocoa, coffee, teriyaki chicken, and Alfredo pasta. We cleaned up and then sat by a fire until around 8. Then we went back by the falls, took some pictures and sat on a rock ledge. It was very peaceful, we then met two hikers, Anna, and Bean. Anna is only here for the weekend but Bean is doing almost half the trail. I thought that was pretty cool. We then went back to camp and went straight to sleep","Jenny Knob Shelter

Apples,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540862,"Today started out kind of rough for me personally. I didn't really wanna get out of bed and hike. It was all wet and rainy but I kept thinking about the hostel. I finally was able to get out of my sleeping bag and roll it up. I rolled up my pillow and my mattress and got out of the tent. Of course, Sherpa was already up getting things together. I emptied my pack and re packed it neatly and put in the things that I had with me in the night. This is our usually morning routine. He's up before me because I have trouble getting up. We pack our packs, eat a bar, and off we go. I usually am ready before him because he has to take down the tent and I don't. We then set off, it started out with a bunch of cobwebs in my face so I eventually asked Sherpa if he could lead. I said ""can you take the cobwebs for a little while"". We are kinda used to it because it is like that every morning. I usually lead and go a little faster but then start to wear myself out. This particular morning I didn't really feel like hiking. I just wanted to crawl under the covers like I used to do. After about four miles we stopped at this road, and Sherpa ate a bar and I had a bit of candy. Right about then I suddenly got my motivation back. That was a nice feeling, I actually felt like hiking. I was kinda bored though, so I said ""let's play a game"" and we started playing guess who. That made the hike go faster. We were quiet once we got to the uphill because it's hard to talk when your short of breath. We hiked that for a good hour or so and ate lunch at the top. After lunch we started hiking and played guess who again. After we got tired of that we played ""I'm going on a trip"" and then we played a two person version of ""the ministers cat"". Lastly towards the end we played a no paper version of hangman. Limit was 7 letters since we couldn't write it down. Once we got tired of that we just stopped playing games for the last mile or so. When we finally got to the hostel it was an awesome feeling. The feeling of... ""I was struggling before but now I feel great"". We got a warm ish shower and we have a bed tonight. Plus laundry and the owners make smoothies for anyone who wants to pay. Tomorrow morning we will wake up to a nice hot breakfast. Hallelujah! Then we will be on our way to Pearisburg, Virginia where we will be spending the Fourth of July. Going to bed now. More tomorrow night.","Dismal Falls

That was a nice treat being we haven't slept in an actual bed for a while. This made our hike quite a bit easier. About a mile or two in, it started pouring rain outside. This made our hike kind of irritating but also quick at the same time. Once it got to about noon, it stopped raining for the most part and we sat down for lunch. After that it was mostly flat and downhill which was very nice. The downhill made my knees hurt pretty bad but once we got into down it was alright. We got into town and we starting looking for the hostel, after a while we got there. It was only about two miles off trail. The hostel was nice, we tented but still got a shower and had access to the kitchen. For the the Fourth of July we made mac and cheese with hotdogs and I had Dairy Queen ice cream.

We then took a shuttle up the trail a bit because we would like to make Harper's ferry on time. After we got dropped off it was a mile uphill. Then another half mile up to the shelter.

Apples,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541474,"Today started out on really great terms. I mixed some coffee with my cocoa so I had a good amount of energy. The first mile or so wasn't too bad and even when we started going up it was pretty mild. Once we got to the ridge we had this nice over look. The hike actually got a bit tougher because of all the rock scrambling. We didn't expect it to have so many hills with so many big boulders, in a way it was kind of fun tho. When we got to the top, which was called Dragons Tooth, we took a nice break. We then descended into lost spectacles gap. That was probably the slowest part of the day, we had to be super careful because we going down big rocks. Some of the rocks were so big that the conservatory put a steel ladder thing. Once we got passed that we moved fairly quickly, at a nice pace. We then started to descend even more down to a road. This part was a lot easier though, once we got to the bottom and got to the road we ate lunch. After that, we walked another mile then stopped to get water. We then started a fairly sizable hill. We weren't expecting it to be so big and it kind of through us off track. Once we got to the top of that mountain we followed the ridge for a long time but it seemed like it just kept going up. By this time we were fairly tired and just wanted to get to camp. We finally got down to this parking lot and that meant we had 3 miles left to go. I ate some black raspberries and they were really good. The next 3 miles weren't so bad, but they seemed hard just because we were tired. We then got to the shelter finally around 7:00.

When we finally got to the knob it was so worth it. Such a beautiful landscape with a huge view. It was so so amazing. After that we headed down to Campbell shelter where we got water. That was about a mile and a half from McAfee knob. We then proceeded on to Hay Rock. The rest of the hike was mostly pleasant. On our way up to tinker cliffs tho, it started pouring rain and it got steeper than we thought. That part was a bit rough but we got to sit under a rock and eat lunch. Then we stopped at Lamberts Shelter to get some more water. This was about 5.4 miles from Hay Rock. The rest of the hike was pretty nice, mostly flat with a little up. We took a short break at an outlook to rest our bodies. 2.9 miles left. After about an hour and a half we made it.

We got into town around noon ish and checked into the hotel, then I took a shower while Sherpa got the supply box. I then watched tv, and after he got back we went to McDonald's. We had to walk about 2 miles total but that's okay. Once we got back from there, we watched tv and chilled until my mom got here. Both me and Sherpa were very excited to see my mom.

But Sherpa offered to lighten the load a bit which was nice. The day today was honestly kinda hard, we got up to this shelter at about 5 miles and I kinda just wanted to stop there. But Sherpa pushed me to go further, I'm really glad he did. We then made it to Curry creek which was super nice. We had water supply and a nice tenting spot.

It was a pretty nice outlook. This guy rode up in his motorcycle, asked if we were hikers and gave us pop and candy. After about another 2 miles of hiking we hit another overlook where a guy gave us water, ice, and a dessert. Like a Mountain House dessert, where we add water to it. He was like a trail angel, and he was fun to talk to as well. We also met Mudfoot and Moose, which was super fun. They are two girls out for 10 days! After that we went another 2.5 miles and we reached our destination. The shelter, it was pretty nice and we found a tent site almost right away.

The rest of the day was pretty good, the terrain started out pretty steep and rough. It stayed that way for a good distance but then got a little easier further on. We got to end with a big downhill after we had followed the ridge. Once we go down to the bridge there was this big swimming hole. We took off our shoes and jumped in. Okay we didn't really jump, it took me like a good 30 minutes to get close to my shoulders. But it was still nice. Then I sat on this rock in the sun to dry off and it was very relaxing. After that I changed, and chilled out for a bit. Around 1:45 Adam, the owner of stanimals shuttle and hostel came and picked us up. We weren't planning on staying at the hostel but Adam worked out a ""work for stay"" deal with us. That night we got our supply box and we had way too much food so we had to sort through it all out a lot in the hike box. Which wasn't too bad, but also kind of a bummer.

We started out with a pretty big hill but once we got up there it was absolutely beautiful. Besides that one hill the rest of the trail was nice flat and mostly down. Until black rock shelter. The hike up to black rock shelter was really hard. We didn't have much energy and we both were really drained. But once we got to the shelter, we stocked up our bellies with food, and water. We had another up after that, but there was a nice 3 miles stretch that was all flat and down. That helped us regain hope about the trail and making it to the campground. There was a good amount of up in the last mile to the campground but it went okay. I was praying the entire time that it wouldn't rain on us, and it ended waiting until we were sheltered.

Apples,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543171,"This morning started out pretty alright, I was tired and chili but I had oatmeal and cocoa and I was good. I also ate a tortilla, with Nutella and that helped a lot. The little bit out of the shelter was nice and flat and after that trail we had hill. But the hill wasn't very steep and it was only a half mile. Then we went down quite a bit, then up quite a bit. We stopped for lunch after 6 miles. Then stopped for a break at nine miles. Once we got to the shelter we just sat and relaxed for a while, we decided to stay on the second floor of the shelter tonight. We wanna be on the trail early tomorrow, and not having a tent to take down makes that easier. We got to have a fire tonight, and we made mashed potatoes for dinner. We also ate meat and cheese and crackers which I like a lot. I pretty much packed my pack and just put it in the bear box so I will be almost ready in the morning. I was very tired and wanted to go to bed around 6:30 but then I would be up too early. So I waited until about 8. Finally I got in bed and now I'm gonna go to sleep.","Hightop hut

Apples,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543172,"This morning we woke up at midnight to about six people coming into the shelter. They obviously had no intention of being quiet. Besides that, they kept shining their headlamps in our eyes. After that it got pretty hard to sleep and I didn't wake up too happy. We got on the trail around 6:40, which is a record. We just wanted to get out, plus we were both already up. I had a cliff bar and so did Sherpa, then we were off. We started out with a descent hill but it wasn't too tiring. Then we stopped at this parking to make coffee and cocoa around 7:30. There were these little black gnats everywhere and some of them even bit. So we moved around a little bit, I even kinda felt the need to dance so I shuffled around some. After that we hiked another like 5 ish miles to the wayside. I got some fudge, rocky road and turtle and boy did that hit the spot. Then Sherpa got a ride down to the ranger station and got a spot. Then he set up the tent, we then hung out for a bit and then hiked back to the tent. Then we hiked to Lewis Mountain falls which were okay, not as cool as I thought. But it was still pretty, we hiked up to the wayside and just when someone offered us a ride it started pouring. We got dropped off at the Rangers station, and I sprinted and got our packs. Then we did laundry and showered and that was alright, but water seeped through the floor and soaked our packs. We then put our packs back and went to the lodge to chill. After that we made campfire and popcorn and went to bed. A good night I say!","bearfence

Apples,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543173,"This morning, it was a bit of a struggle to wake up, but once we got up it was alright. It was kinda chili but later in the day got pretty hot. I got to have cereal this morning which was really nice. We started out our hike with a really nice and path and pretty easy route. We took a small break, at a shelter and we got to use the privy. We then hiked a while and stopped for a snack break at this overlook at around six and a half miles. We then continued on, and took a break around another three miles or so. The path started to get a bit rocky and for a good half hour my knee really really hurt. I took ibuprofen but that didn't help much. Once we took a sit down rest it felt better though. We got to this picnic area about eleven miles in and sat down and ate a really early dinner. That was when we decided to go to the second shelter, another 8 miles. We felt pretty good, we stopped at Birds Nest shelter for a few minutes then made our way to this shelter. We rolled in around 7:30. It was a long day and we were tired. We can take a short day tomorrow though. This was our biggest day yet.","Big meadows campground

Apples,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543174,"Today we woke up a bit late, but on purpose, we got to sleep in until about 8. We had a good breakfast, I   felt alright but like most days it was hard to get up. It was a hill right out of the shelter but it wasn't too big so we didn't mind. We got to meet these two girls, pig and cairn, but they were gone by the time we were up. It was 7.3 to the wayside and we knew we were going to eat lunch there but we should've had a snack. We totally dragged towards the end because we were hungry. The wayside was nice, I got to charge my phone. We resupplied and got breakfast for the morning. I had a grilled cheese and a cinnamon roll and propel. Sherpa had a cheeseburger and the rest the same. We met this guy named Paul and talked to him for a while, he asked a lot of questions and we had a good talk. Right when we were a bout to leave a huge storm came through and we went under this shelter thing. We didn't end up leaving till around four, because that's when the storm ended. We had ice cream to refuel, blackberry ice cream and it was delicious. We then went another 6.5 miles and that wasn't so bad. We got to the shelter around 6:45, had some snacks and I had ramen. Then we saw three bears walking across a tree branch. After that we went to bed.","pass mountain hut

Apples,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543175,"Today we woke up around six, this morning was probably one of the hardest to get out of bed. I just wanted to keep sleeping. I had an oat meal raisin cliff bar and that tasted really good. We then were on or way. The first 3.5 miles were pretty easy and we blew through them. Then we went another 3 ish miles and had a snack then, I had a chocolate chip cliff bar and that tasted very yummy. We went another 3 ish miles and ate lunch at Tom Floyd shelter. I went to go get water and got lost and ended up back tracking on the trail. Wasn't very happy about that. But then I ate some ramen noodles and felt better. We then had a little over 3 more to go. That last stretch was almost all down besides one small up. We blew through that pretty quickly. We got to the hostel and got a nice shower then went into town. We resupplied and got Chinese food, and I was very very happy. Excited to sleep in a bed.","gravel springs hut

It didn't take long to pack and stuff but we definitely took our time eating and relaxing. We wanted to take and easy day today. We got on the trail around 10 which was still pretty good. Although we started with a hill and it was very hot. We then stopped for lunch at this one shelter that was really nice. It had a pavilion and a shower. We wanted to stay there, but we needed to keep going. We had a mild hill after but it was in the sun so we were sweating buckets. We then ended with a bigger hill but it had some breaks so it was alright. We got to the shelter around 4:30 and sat down then picked a tent spot. Ate dinner, made a fire and off to bed","mountain home cabin

Once I actually got out of bed it wasn't so bad, and I had a nice breakfast. I had Nutella and tortillas and a Nutrigrain bar. I also packed my pack pretty quickly so I got to relax more. We left our campsite around 9. We started with a good amount of hill but once we got up that it wasn't too bad. We had a good amount of flat and down after that. We stopped at a parking lot and it was kinda the only option. It was noisy and not very comfortable but we made due. It was still food and that was good. On the way there we went through a meadow with lots of ripe berries. We gobbled those up very quickly! It was such a good treat! After lunch we had a couple more hills but that was alright. We got into camp around 4 and took a nap until about 6. We then washed up and ate and we were in bed by 7:30. Not excited about the roller coaster tomorrow.","manassas gap shelter
