Benster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516670,"Well, I am on my way to become a hiker. I have started to hike regularly (once or twice a week, 5-7 miles each). I also begin to look into acquiring some packbacking gears. Who knows, before long, I may see your guys on the trails and in the shelters. 
Happy Hiking.",,Kitchen,"Nov 01, Sun",0
