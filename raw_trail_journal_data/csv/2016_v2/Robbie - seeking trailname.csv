Robbie - seeking trailname,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524796,"I've had the privilege to take a sabbatical and do a road trip from California back home to Ontario, Canada. I'd been doing quite a few day hikes and car-camping along the way, but I was eager to start exploring the AT in sections. I'm trying to remember when I first heard of the AT. A few days ago, I took the car through the Smokies along the road which had been closed until that morning, over Newfound Gap, where I took about 100 steps on the very icy AT. I believe I actually did a small day hike in New Hampshire almost twenty years ago, camping while hitchhiking to Maine in late August. My friend and I ran into two thru-hikers from the south. The Internet was barely a thing back then, and this was a lovely way to learn of the AT for the first time. We were tempted to take the AT the rest of the way, but we had such heavy gear, including a guitar in a solid case, that we stuck to thumbing rides.Since then, I've slept in quite a bit of ""walk-in"" campsites, but rarely more than half a mile. Last year, I did do a strenuous seven mile hike into the Big Sur forest, so that was both inspiring and an education about overnight hiking. In eastern Canada, canoe-camping is more popular than hiking, since we have so many lakes that canoes can do most of the heavy-lifting. I actually researched today's hike beforehand. I wasn't going to sleep on the trail, but I brought all my overnight gear, in order to get used to hiking with the weight, as I had done yesterday on a section of the Mountain-to-sea trail near Asheville. One thing I didn't have was trekking poles, which I had always been skeptical about; they'd seemed annoying and unnecessary.Well, I was soon wishing I had them, as the trail-north switchbacks up and out of Hot Springs were quite intense. It was a warm sunny day, though, and it was fun to have such a dramatic vista across the French Broad River. Not particularly attractive, though, since the rooftop of a massive warehouse dominates the landscape.I chose this section because it forms a loop back to the trail head, via the Pump Gap Trail, which took me back into the valley along a stream. That trail had some strange remnants of industrial work in the form concrete sheds with signs warning ""EXPLOSIVES - KEEP OUT"". The worst thing that happened was I got a booter while attempted to ford the stream on the widely spaced slimy rocks. All in all, I think it was pretty representative of the variety I would later find on the AT. As for the town, I enjoyed breakfast at the diner, dinner at the Ironhorse pub, and wifi in the library parking lot.","Hot Springs, NC

Robbie - seeking trailname,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524797,"I got off to a late start on the drive, and didn't arrive in Damascus until about 4pm to start my hike. I would visit outfitters the next day to prepare for a multi-day hike. A couple of blocks trail-south from the central park, steep switchbacks took me up out of town. I said hello to two NOBO hikers ending their day at a reasonable time, unlike me. Up on the ridge, I met an older gentleman who had just set up his hammock and was making dinner. He gave me some good advice for tomorrow. I'd thought I would park in Damascus and hike north from there, but he suggested I park at Grayson Highlands and do a loop there. Since I was just doing a section, he thought it would be a shame if the 20 mile climb discouraged me or worse.As for this day, I made it to the state line fairly easily and took a few steps into Tennessee as the sun set behind the bare trees. I don't really recommend night hiking, but the return was fairly easy, and at this time of year, with no leaves on the trees, it's fun to hike into a valley and see all the lights of a town below.I ended up doing a bit more night-hiking on later sections. I'd only recommend it for sections that your research predicts is mostly flat and fairly free of rocks. Moonlight also helps a lot.","Damascus

Robbie - seeking trailname,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524428,"Staying in Waynesboro at Stanimal's hostel was great. He was very helpful, suggesting this overnight hike as a good section. D showed me a good place to park and shuttled me further down the Blue Ridge Parkway as we talked about our shared interest in education. I spent most of the day in the mist which turned to drizzle and eventually a harder rain by nightfall, but I had a lovely time. It's funny going to noted rock outcrop vistas only to find them shrouded in fog. Well, I've always liked lichen, but today I realized that moisture in the early spring makes their colours pop. I don't know if this section is known to be especially vivid, but I found it awesomely eye-popping.The other thing I loved here was the geology. Repeatedly, as if an artist's signature style, diagonal rocks jutted up through the soil, from three inches tall to 20 yards high. Each triangle splattered with a beautiful mess of lichen, of course. With a late start and all the up and down, it was a stretch for me to get to the shelter, but I was told it was an especially nice one, so I pressed on. At dusk, the foggy rain made my headlamp nearly useless. I was careful descending the switchbacks and fording the stream, but I walked right by the shelter, and doubled back once I knew I must have gone too far. Lesson learned: switchbacks, fog, rain and nightfall are not a headlamp's friend. I'd passed a nice tent site on the top of the hill, and that would have made for a more relaxed evening.","Reid's Gap, Blue Ridge Parkway

Robbie - seeking trailname,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524425,"After barely finding the shelter in last night's dark and rainy fog, it was awesome waking up to such beautiful surroundings. I hiked about 300 paces downstream to a nice zig-zagging waterfall. The fog soon crept back, but on my hike out, these conditions had me appreciating all that is tiny, especially the dewdrops on spiderwebs that survived the rain. New flowers are coming up, too.When I got to the road at Rockfish Gap, I could barely see 20 feet in front of me. The rare passing car had its hazards on. I ended up checking my phone's GPS to locate the parking lot when I'd left my car.","Paul Wolfe Shelter

Robbie - seeking trailname,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524398,"Had a yummy waffle breakfast hosted by Benjamin at Tea Horse Hostel, with four other guests: day hikers and a duo going south into Shenandoah for a week.Checked out the ATC HQ and planned my section. Laurel from Tea Horse was fun to chat with as she shuttled me to just north of the Pennsylvania Maryland border, to hike south to the Mason-Dixon Line and start Maryland's 40 miles of AT.Saw some very vivid green lichen on a vast slope of boulders. Then, vast array of graffiti on boulders, approaching the hang glider rock. I was going to stay at Raven Rock shelter, but a large tent city of scouts, leaders and dads was there. It was nice chatting with them, but I had time to push it to the next shelter, where there was a small crowd, as well as a roaring fire.Hiked through many postcard perfect snowy scenes: snowy woods and snowy fields. Didn't expect that on the last day of winter. Actually, the forecast called for worse, and I'm glad I decided to go out anyway.","Pen Mar Road

Robbie - seeking trailname,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524397,"Despite the cold, had a nice breakfast chatting with two Duluth, Minnesotans. I forget the name of the 1988 thru-hiker that plays in T.H.U.G. -- the Two Harbors Ukulele Group.The snow was pretty on the hike, but I could barely feel my fingers until I thought to make mittens out of a spare pair of socks.Running Rock (?) shelters seemed nice, but I felt I could motor on to the next, which would make the next day easier: a hike into Harper's Ferry with daylight to spare. It was fun to bump into New Year, who I had met yesterday at the ATC HQ before starting this section. He was the the fourth NOBO to hit Harpers this year, and I enjoyed hearing about his take on hiking.I did the most hiking of my life today, at least with a heavy pack, and I was surprised to find the shelter was an extra 1/4 mile off the AT, but I made it before sundown, made some quick minestrone and was in bed by dark. That's when two new arrivals surprised me: Horse is a 2015 thru-hiker celebrating the anniversary, and Mule is his younger brother. Nice guys.","Ensign Cowell Shelter

Robbie - seeking trailname,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524396,"After 48 hours of cold, clouds, snow and rain, the sun rose and poured into this lovely east facing shelter. The hike was quite easy, until the switchbacks descending from Weverton Cliffs, which offer a great view of the meeting of the two rivers below. The C&O Canal Towpath is four fast miles, but not too boring, since I saw geese and turtles in the canal, and the layers of history: natural, canal, railroad, ruins of bridges, and today's Harpers Ferry. Checked out the excellent local African-American history museum before hiking up many steps, both natural and man-made, to the side trail leading to the ATC HQ. Spent three hours there, chatting and checking out maps in order to plan my ""14 state challenge"" as drive north and home to Canada.   ","Crampton Gap Shelter, MD
