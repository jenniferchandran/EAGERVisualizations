Ard and Foxtrot ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533291,"We finally decided on our trail names. Richard is Ard, why Ard? Well, it was his nickname in the Navy,they called him Rich which he disliked so would say ""Ard, my name is Rich Ard"" so instead of Rich they called him Ard. Ard just retired March 1st 2016 after 37yrs of active duty service and he'll celebrate his 60th birthday on the trail in July. Just living the dream!My sister in law Kim came up with Foxtrot, rather clever I thought incorporating my surname, though don't hold your breath waiting to read about any trotting! Ard and I have just finished doing another shakedown of our packs...we switched from cloth bags to plastic bags for toiletries and cloths etc, I'm weighing in grams now ....yep! Seriously shaving any weight I don't absolutely have carry.I've got our food boxes packed and labelled they will be mailed to either hostels, hotels or post offices along the trail. We will only carry 5 days of food each since one days food weights around 2 lbs so that's 10lbs and with 3 litres of water it weighs in at around 16 lbs just for food and water. So we'll stop to pick up our mail drops and check into a hostel or hotel for a shower on the 6th day...hmm! Maybe there will be some trotting going on on those days.",,Trail Names,,0
Ard and Foxtrot ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531552,"14 more days and we'll be on the way to our adventure of a lifetime. My husband Richard and I have been collecting our gear since January and today we bought water/camp shoes and a journal (just in case we have no phone signal/battery) so we are good to go.
We are leaving on the 19th and have a 36hr bus journey to Gainesville. I wanted to fly but for some reason Richard thinks a 36hr bus journey will enhance our experience hmm! Says he always wanted to know how the pioneers did it....well not on a bus that's for sure...I'm going to have to take some dramamine cos I get sick on a swing!",,View Entry,"May 05, Thu",0
Ard and Foxtrot ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532945,"I've had problems getting a big enough pack to fit me, I'm short, 5 foot 2 inches short, so I   really fall in the kids backpack section in stores. I saw a new pack on line with comments from short women saying how wonderful the fit was so I promptly ordered it. Alas, another fail so I think I'm stuck with my very comfortable but tiny 40L pack. Oh well the smaller the pack the less I can stuff in it, my essentials and 5 days of food thats it, thankfully Richard will carry the tent.We have packed and unpacked so many times to whittle away some of the weight it's just crazy. A few weeks ago Richard read an article about people chopping their toothbrush handles off in order to loose ounces, at the time I thought that was going too far but trying to Hike with 30lbs on your back is no joke...I'm off to get the saw...ha! ha! Under a week before we leave and can't wait.","

After living in Alabama I know that my hair will swell out at least an inch per hour in the southern humidity. So with said hair now plastered firmly to my head our wonderful son James drives us to the bus stop at 4:20am.We board the bus with 6 other passengers at around 5am and I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of leg room. We have seat belts, power outlets, cup holders, TV screens and last but not least a toilet. After seeing news reports of the very long lines of passengers trying to get through security at the airports, the bus doesn't seem such a bad idea after all. I took dramamine an hour before we got on the bus so I'm feeling good but a little sleepy. Just as we left the depo the bus driver ran through a list of 8 stops we will make before we get to Boston at around 11am where we will change buses and head to New York.It is such a glorious day and very relaxing just looking out of the window at the beautiful Maine scenery.","

We changed buses in Boston, New York and then in Richmond VA which took us all the way to Atlanta Georgia where we once again transferred to Gainesville Georgia. The people we met were all very friendly and we had a few laughs while waiting in line for transfers. I know this will shock you guys cos you know how motion sick I get but I only took 4 pills the whole 38hrs that I was on the bus, 2 the first morning and then around 2am the following morning, though I think I was feeling nauseous from lack of sleep and food at that point but did not want to risk it.The hostel shuttle picked us up before the bus had even pulled away and offered to take us shopping for last minute items or food....we took him up on the food and we got a pizza to go. The Hiker Hostel was awesome, it's a large 3 story log cabin with a lovey outdoor area. Josh and Leigh, the owners, are warm and friendly and very accommodating. I have back packed across the US and parts of Canada and this is the by far the nicest hostel I have ever come across. We met Heather from Pennsylvania and two southern ladies who were ""slack packing"" we chatted and laughed alot.","

I've found out I cannot sleep sitting up, not on a plane, not on a train not in a car and definitely not on a bus!We had a huge breakfast and saw everyone hit the trails this morning, it had forecast rain and storms and while it did rain this morning before lunch it was a gorgeous day. I washed my cloths then unpacked my gear and sprayed everything with promethiun which supposedly kills bugs that land and does not wash out for 6 washes.Then Richard and I went for a walk and the hostel dog and cat came for a walk with us. It was the funniest thing watching the cat merrily following us but now and again she would run at the dog and they'd play...never seen anything like it.Went to the Cresent moon restaurant for dinner with 2 other hikers (Mike and Richard) who will also be hiking the trail tomorrow. All packed up and ready to go first thing in the morning.","

Ard and Foxtrot ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534819,"I tossed and turned all last night, worried and excited about setting off today.The shuttle dropped us at the Springer Mountain car park at 10:30am. We hiked the 0.9 miles to the top with our fully loaded packs. Richards was 45lbs and mine 34lbs it felt a lot more that's for sure. We had to retrace our steps back down the mountain to head North on the trail.Well I can tell you guys it felt like Georgia was just one big mountain and uphill both ways and who knew the Georgia mile was so much longer than a regular mile! It was a glorious day with prefect Temps for our first day of hiking, which went well though we could have done without the last 2 mile climb. We just made it to the campsite at around 4pm before collapsing with exhaustion.We set up the tent and then limped to the bottom of the campsite to the tiniest Creek to filter some water for dinner and breakfast. Barely able to eat we were so exhausted.","Springer Mountain

Ard and Foxtrot ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534832,"Boy did the trail kick our butts today! That Georgia mile got longer and longer as the hills got higher!We woke around 6:30 am but didn't leave camp until 9:30am, we limped out of camp and filtered some water from a much better stream about 3/4 of a mile away which was a good thing cos there was very little water to be had all day and 2 gruelling mountains to climb.The first couple of hours was easy up and downs but then we hit Sassafras Mountain where we climbed 700 feet in around 1 mile and back down again only to go immediately up Justice Mountain but that was only a 300 foot climb in around half a mile. Boy were we Exhausted! We've met some lovely people on the trail, Mike (trail Ninja) and Richard who stayed with us at the Hiker Hostel. Crystal and Half who we met this morning and then a lady I think her name was Jannette and her dog Trooper. We first met her just after springer Mountain, she had been walking 5 miles a day with a heavy pack but today she did 10 and we cheered her down Justice mountain and into the camp site. Richard and I walked another mile or so to Gooch shelter getting there around 6pm. The shelter and tent area was packed so we pitched our tent in a tiny space which slanted downhill and Richard kept rolling into me all night. Our knees, backs and feet are holding up and so far the only blisters I have are on my thumbs from my poles.Living the dream.","Hawk mountain campsite

Ard and Foxtrot ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535250,"I found it very hard to sleep last night with so many people in camp, it was like trying to sleep with an orchestra of snores playing and then the tent zippers accompanied the orchestra by opening and closing all night long as people went to the bathroom.There were 17 tents and 1 hammock when we went to bed but when I stuck my head out of the tent at 7am this morning there were only 3 or 4 left! We finally left camp around 10am and were both feeling good so we must be getting used to it.Another slog up Ramrock mountain then a gentle decline through gorgeous shady woods and glades it really is wonderful walking through such areas. It was a hot and humid day but we were cool and shaded under the canopy of trees.We got to Woody Gap and there were a bunch of hikers we knew sitting on the picnic tables debating whether or not to go to a near by hostel ( Wolfpen Gap). It was very hot and humid and the thought of cold drinks, shower,real food and a comfy bed was just too much. Kevin and son Eric called the shuttle and Richard and I along with J-neen and her dog Trooper piled in heading for a treat we all thought. Sometimes it's just best to stick with the plan!The hostel had beds for about 20 but there were only 11 of us there...good thing too when there is one bathroom and 11 smelly hikers! The shower was lovely and hot and I got to wash all our cloths and my sleeping bag which I had managed to get soaking wet.The 5 of us and the dog all bunked in one room and when I say bunked that's literally it! Bunks with pressed wood, some had ratty bits of carpet on them, mine had a road sign covering the bottom. It was a hard night with little sleep for any of us. I thought of going to sleep on the settee in the sitting room but J-need beat me to it!","Gooch mountain shelter

Ard and Foxtrot ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535255,"We were all up early and were greeted by the sound of squealing tires and revving engines. Apparently it is a right of passage for the Suches High school seniors to parade up and down the street in their trucks burning rubber and revving their engines. The hostel is in Suches.I had another hot shower and Richard went downstairs to the store to get hot coffee. Oh! what a luxury to have filter coffee.We all piled into the shuttle..the guy who works there's pick up truck and went back to Woody Gap.Of course, we were greeted on the trail by a big bloody mountain!...we are still in Georgia remember! So, climbed Big Cedar mountain which was not too bad at all and the walk down the mountain was glorious, gentle slope with easy relaxed walking in a cool shady section.We set up camp at Lance Creek campground which is the last camp ground before the bear canister area. We arrived at mid day so had a lazy day. Kevin and Eric arrived some time after us and unfortunately Eric had injured his knee so they will need to leave the trail tomorrow.We met another through hiker Jason, a section hiker Yehudah...pronounced you-who-da and a family with four young children who were section hiking. We made dinner and hung our food bags on the cables and then sat around the camp fire laughing and joking. Went to bed around 10pm.","Woody Gap

Ard and Foxtrot ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536179,"Up at 6am this morning, had breakfast and broke camp around 7:40am. Set off on the trail with J-Neen and Trooper, who refused to get out of tent, so she pulled the tent down around him and had to drag him out...poor puppy has sore feet. It wasn't long before the two of them were out of sight to us, it was very humid and slow going. My glasses kept steaming up and the sunscreen was running into my eyes until I donned my Pocahontas head band.Now this area is Bear cannister only until June 1st or so all the signs say...I hope the bears read the warnings and leave by June 1st or there will be some hungry hikers if those bears get into their food bags! As you've probably gathered by now I'm pretty freaked out by the thought of seeing, let alone coming close to a bear...much to Richard's disdain I hasten to add, he gets so irritated when I even mention a bear. Well, about a mile out of camp we started seeing areas on the side of the trail with ""big"" claw marks and loose dirt. We followed these for about 1.5 miles up the trail. It certainly looked like a bear was clawing certain areas of the ground looking for grubs or other wiggly beasties and you could tell the areas were freshly dug as the earth was still damp near the claw marks. OK guys now that's my explanation....there's also a pic that Richard took of said claw marks. Richards explanation is; some guy is walking the trail with a rake and periodically raking about a 2 foot section to clear the leaves. I know right! I think the trail is messing with his brain cos who has a 4 pronged rake that looks like a big old bears claw!!Just before slaughter Creek and the start of Blood mountain we saw a father and son who were breaking camp. Of course I couldn't resist asking if any bears had been around but was horrified to hear that early evening they had heard crashing around camp and then when they went to get their cannister at breakfast from where they had hidden them the brush was all flattened and their canisters had been messed with. Of course Richard scoffed at this and said ""bears, was just their explanation, it could have been anything"". Now there are warning signs all over the area of bear interactions so odds are- if it sounds like a bear, it's probably a bear. I figured I just have to be able to run faster than Richard hmmm! Feeling much better all ready ha! Ha!We both have bear bells on our packs which are supposed to warn bears and critters and they'll run away. Though a fellow hiker Mike (trail Ninja) tells me it's a bears dinner bell and the bear spray I carry....strong pepper spray that sprays up to 30 ft is just the bears Tabasco sauce! Well, we climbed up up and away and finally reached the top of Blood mountain . It really was a breathtaking view but Richard didn't think the views were quite worth the hours of sweat and toil. There is a stone shelter right on top with a fire place, mind it looks hardly used.The mountain is covered by blackberry bushes and pink rhododendrons though only a few are in flower but by next week the mountain will be a blaze of pink. I was surprised at how rocky blood mountain is- actually big massive granite boulders. The hike down Blood mountain was horrendous-2.5 miles of steep, knee wrenching boulder strewn hell. Why people say the trail is easier to start in Georgia I will never know! We were so relieved to get ther bottom and see the other guys from camp last night had made it. Both J-neen and Mike were hobbling and had knee braces on both knees and planned, like us, to take a zero day tomorrow. At Neel's Gap is an outfitters so we looked for a new pillow, new sleeping pad and lighter sleeping bag for Richard to no avail and had a cold drink and sandwich while we waited for the Hiker Hostel shuttle. We got to the hostel around 5pm, showered and opened our food packages that James had mailed us. One of the owners, Leigh, drove us to get Chinese takeaway and some cold beers, we were in bed by 8pm.","Lance Creek Campground

Washed cloths and all our camping stuff then sorted the food from our mail drops. My hair was growing fatter and fatter by the minute in the humidity so I looked like a crazy bush lady, imagine what I will look like after 3 months! So, decided to get the shuttle into Dahlonega and get a haircut, look for stuff for Richard and have dinner. Had no luck finding what Richard wanted in town so went to Pueblo Mexican restaurant then walked about 0.5 mile to get a haircut and go to Walmart for a few odds and ends. Got back to the hostel around 6pm and had to wash all my cloths again to get all the hair off. I only have one t-shirt, one pair of pants, a button down shirt to prevent sunburn, a pair of sleeping shorts and one spare underware, we have to pack light so I wash my cloths out near a stream or at the hostels we stay at. An English guy and Scottish lady are also staying at the hostel, so mainland Britain is represented here tonight. Watched some tv and chatted with other hikers bed around 10:30pm.","Neel's Gap

Ard and Foxtrot ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536195,"Up around 7pm, quick shower and breakfast. Our packs were heavy today with our 6 day supply of food and full water containers. Mine weighed 35lbs and Richard's was 43lbs. The shuttle dropped us at Neel's Gap at around 9am but Richard wanted to go to the outfitters where he got a lighter sleeping bag and a new sleeping pad and then mailed his old ones back home so we didn't hit the trail until around 10am and yes folks it was all uphill.What a gorgeous day, uphill to start, but gentle undulating hills for most of the day until we got to Wildcat mountain which was pretty much straight up but had many switch backs. We were planning to stay at the Whitley shelter on the summit but when we finally panted our way to the top the sign said the shelter was 1.2 miles off the trail...we were not about to walk an extra 2.4 miles there and back so kept going down the mountain. Found a good water source and met a couple from New Orleans filling up, we filled all our containers to see us through diner and breakfast and to make it to the next water hole. Walked another 1.1 miles to a camp place just off the trail. We were being eaten alive so had to light a fire before we even could set up camp. Put up the tent, boiled water for noodles and a cup of tea, hung our food bags and backpacks and settled down for the night at 7:30pm - both exhauted.","Neel's Gap

Up at 7 am broke camp and started at around 9am. It wasn't long before I felt exhausted, I had had golden syrup oatmeal but it just wasn't enough so I drank some electrolyte and ate a trail bar and after an hour I felt so much more Vitali zed.We thought it would be a relatively easy day but there was no water for most of the day and it was hot and humid, we went from one dry stream to the next. We ended up walking 11 miles to the shelter where there was water, I could have done without the last 2 miles which was just walking over rocks and boulders boy oh boy it was awful!Arrived at the shelter around 6pm and it was thundering and spitting with rain so we decided to spend the night in the shelter. I hope no mice run over me in the night cos I'm told they love the shelters and often chew holes in backpacks. Hmm! Living the dream?? Next dream I'm going to have will definitely have wheels involved in it!We saw 2 snakes today one all black another black with orange stripes, the first wild snakes I've been up close and personal with a snake and they weren't so bad.","White oak stamp

Ard and Foxtrot ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536201,"Slept maybe an hour last night, between worrying about mice running over me (I saw 2 before we even settled down) apparently mice chew through backpacks too so we hang them and leave the zips open so the mice can get in. What kind of dream am I living?. Only 4 of us in the shelter so plenty of room but just could not fall asleep.Saw J-neen and Trooper they were off to Helen for a mail pick up. Left camp around 9am had to fill up with water first so didn't actually get hiking until around 10am. The heat and humidity just zaps your energy...I wasn't feeling too bad cos I drank electrolyte replacement before we set off but Richard wouldn't so he was very slow and toiled all day long. We stopped early so he could rest up...he still refused to have electrolyte replacement. Oh well! At least we made it past the Boot tree at Neel's Gap where disgruntled hikers toss their boots and quit the trail.We set up camp around 3:30pm got water and ate a double ration of food. They say by the 2nd week your energy and moral plummets. I'm hoping Richard will feel better tomorrow. A father and son, Paul and Paul camped next to us and sat talking with us around the camp fire. Hit the deflating sleeping pad around 8:30...I took 2 benadryl to help me get some sleep. Can't find the leak and no water deep enough to see bubbles leaking from my pad.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Walked up Tray mountain first thing...well of course we did! Some guys arriving late at the campsite last night said they saw a bear on tray mountain but it ran off, so I'm on high alert this morning.Richard gets very irritated when I mention bear so I haven't uttered the word for the last 3 days. Today while climbing Tray mountain I was ringing my bell like a crazy women- good thing there were no kids around or they would have thought I was the ice cream man. It started thundering around 2pm so we decided to spend the night at the next campsite we came across which was at around 3:30pm. We put the tent up as it was spotting with rain and walked 0.5 mile to fill up with water, we use a sawyer filter so it takes about 40mins to fill both Richard's and my containers. We usually hike with around 3 liters each but I fill 5 for camp and Richard has 4 that way we don't have to refill again in the morning.The storm passed with just a small shower and it turned out to be a lovely evening. We had a great time with Kevin, Neil, Frank and his dog chowder laughing and talking around the camp fire, you meet some lovely people. Frank had just bought a super light, super expensive tent and chowder was asleep in it when all of a sudden he just dived through the side of the tent and ripped a huge hole through the fly screen..ruined the tent. We had noodles and I had a treat..mint hot chocolate. We haven't really been hungry but eat anyway. Richard has granola which I made up with powdered milk so he just adds water...I have oat meal or breakfast bar and we have 2 cups of coffee each. I fill up with electrolyte drink about 1 litre in the morning and try to get at least 2 litres in before lunch then sip the rest of the day..that way I don't have to get up so much at night....there's always bright eyes looking back at you as you squat...daintily of course!We have 2 snacks per day tuna or summer sausage and tortillas for lunch and then noodles or I made up mashed potatoes with stuffing and Bisto (gravy powder) add hot water and a pack of spam and we have a cooked dinner yum!

They took all our cloths and gave us scrubs to wear while they washed our cloths.The hostel shuttle took 11 of us to the small town of Hiawassee GA...which is where the Movie deliverance was filmed and the child who played one of the banjo's still lives here and works in the hardware store here.So, 11 of us went to a Mexican restaurant, we must have looked as if we were on a day pass from a local mental hospital in our mismatched hospital scrubs, but the locals must be used to it cos they never gave us a second glance.

Corn walked with me the last 2 miles chatting all the way, he had lunch with us at the shelter but then hiked on since he needed to get to Franklin and get a new hammock. We had a cup of cheese and broccoli soup to warm us up and then I hung a line to dry our cloths. Threw some rope around a tree in between rain showers so we could hang our food bags before we went to bed. We are likexpecting a couple of hobos with all our cloths hanging around.This shelter is located in a bear sanctuary, can you believe that! So, I'm in a shelter which I hate staying in but it's still raining. We can see the mice nests in the eve's. So it looks like a good night's sleep will not happen for me!","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Ard and Foxtrot ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537501,"Well more and more people kept arriving soaking wet at the shelter last night, 8 of us in all but 2 slept out in hammocks and one in his tent. I actually had a good night's sleep since I was feeling secure with so many people around. We were all woken from our slumber at about 3am by a big storm and rain hammering down on the tin roof of the shelter but I didn't take long to fall back asleep being lulled by the noise of the rain.We set off hiking around 8:30am and it was glorious everything smelled so fresh after the rain and the terrain was pretty easy going with no major hills. Most of the walk was through tunnels of pink rhododendron bushes and the winds last night had blown lots of petals down so it was a carpet of pink. We made very good time today getting to Carter Gap Shelter around 1:30pm. The shelter wasn't very appealing so we set up our tent on the site of the old shelter. Two guys who were at last night's shelter set up camp next to us..they were policemen from Tallahassee Florida, so I'm hoping one of them will have a gun for bear protection.I desperately need to wash my cloths but the stream only had a trickle of water, so I took water back to camp and washed my cloths in a carrier bag that I had. There was a fire pit and someone had rigged a cloths line I was hoping a fire would dry my pants but we just could not light a fire everything was so wet from the rain. Since I only have one pair of pants in need them dry forun tomorrow so I'm putting them under my sleeping pad hoping they will dry. This shelter is on top of a mountain and the mist is coming down and it's getting very cold so it's time for bed at 6:45pm.","Standing Indian Shelter

It was so cold this morning and no, my pants and shirt did not dry all it did was wet my sleeping pad. So, I donned wet cloths and ate breakfast. We miraculously had phone service so I called James and as I was talking to him out of the corner of my eye I see our tent tumbling over the ground. Richard had removed the tent pegs and turned to put them away when the wind sent the tent tumbling.It was a perfect hiking day, cold and windy and for the first 4 miles it was absolutely gorgeous ridge walking, mind i did fall- the trail was wet and very muddy in some areas and yes you guessed it, the sludgy mud was exactly where I fell. I slipped on a rock and my pack went over my head and I went head first into the mud...so much for clean pants. My left leg and boot was covered in sludge and there is lay, on my back, arms and legs falling like I was a dying fly! I walked my knee on the rock but nothing too bad.We walked to Mooney gap and then things got a little exciting. The path was very narrow and the drop was so steep even the trees were falling down the cliff. Even drugged and blindfolded we would never have gotten you to do that section Cammie!There is so much Mica in the rocks that it looks like the trail is made of silver when the sun caught it just right. Just as we neared the summit (or what we thought was the summit) we cleared the trees and there stood the Rangers truck...I bet you thought I was going to say a bear then didn't you? You should have heard Richard....walked all the way on the cliff and there was a road right there! Ha! Ha! Then things just got really precarious as we literally climbed bare rock...we were hanging on with fingers and the tips of our boots. Albert mountain was a 500 foot rock that we climbed in 0.3 of a mile. All I could hear behind me was""you have got to be kidding me"" and ""I knew I should have taken that service road. We hit a milestone when we got to the top of Albert Mountain it was our 100 mile marker. Yahoo! Only 2089 miles more ha! Ha! The views from Albert mountain were awesome and there was a huge fire tower we could have climbed but I'm not good with heights so neither of us ventured up.The walk down the mountain was easy and pleasant thankfully and we were soon at long Branch Shelter. It was a lovely shelter with no signs of mice. The stream to get water was great..what I had needed yesterday to wash my pants. We had the last of our food for diner and went to bed exhausted but what an exhilarating day.Off to Franklin NC tomorrow, we'll have to buy food there since we couldn't get in touch with James as we haven't had a signal for a while.

Richard was up early he got really cold, in the mountains it gets down into the 40'sun and was windy. Richard woke me with a nice hot cup of coffee it was a real treat.We were packed up and on the trail by 7:15am. Being cold and windy it was perfect for hiking and we made excellent time getting to the road by 11am. We were very lucky and got a ride from two guys who just dropped another hiker off. They took us to the Budget Inn and we got a room there hmmm! Not the best of places,dirty bathroom and smelling of mold. We nearly choked when Richard opened the fridge and had to leave the room door open to get rid of the smell.Franklin is way bigger than I thought it was going to be. It's situated in a kind of basin and mountains circle the whole town it's gorgeous. The public transportation is awesome...you call the bus depo tell them where you are and they will come and pick you up and it costs only $1 each.We were surprised to see Frank and his dog chowder here.

It was hot, hot, hot and very humid and the terrain was just brutal though the profile in the book made it look like gentle downhills.If we thought the climb up Copper Ridge was tough the decent from Wesser Bald was an absolute killer. Just after lunch something on me started creaking-yes,I know,I thought it might have been my hips, back or knees too but it was the back of my backpack-slowly but surely its falling apart, Yep! so am I ha!ha! Going up hill my heels and hips hurts and going down its my big toes and knees...can't win!The last 2 miles was just a killer as both of us were out of water. We both had 3 litres each but it was so hot and all the streams were dry. We got to the shelter at about 6pm and headed straight to the stream and gulped water for about 10mins straight. There were about 8 high school boys camping but the shelter was empty so, since it was just the 2 of us i set the tent up inside the shelter but with only the fly screen since it was so hot and humid. Richard will only tent camp if he has perfectly flat ground, so we spend more nights in shelters where I rarely get much sleep but with the tent in the shelter we are both happy.

Had our coffee and breakfast and set off eagerly for the outdoor center and a shower. It didn't seem like a mile and was a nice walk but already very hot and humid.We are staying at the Dogwood lodge - a small room with a Queen bed on the bottom and twin bunk up top, we have our own bathroom but its across the hall, a little different but all they had apart from the bunkhouse and Richard finds it hard to sleep with other people snoring....ironic coming from a guy who sounds like a freight train when he snores, I snort as I fall asleep, I know as I've woken myself up a few times. I wear ear plugs every night now, that way I don't hear the snores or the beasties roaming around the forest at night. I am really surprised I haven't had a nervous breakdown sleeping in the woods with all the bears etc and its absolutely pitch black at night with no cultural light interference at all and I'm scared of the dark , yes I know, at 21 years old I should be over it by now! but I'm still a big baby!Thankfully I use a she-wee. My sister Dawn, who has been up Everest and the Himalayas, so knows all about the trials and tribulations of the female bathroom situation told me about it. So, I purchased one (from Walmart no less) Dawn had said that her's was too short and so had found an extension, so I tried mine out at home and also needed a longer one...its really a cup with about a 3 inch tube so women can pee standing up. Well my extension is a bit long but I was really thankful one night when I was desperate and didn't dare wake Richard who was sound asleep, anyway, the rustling around the tent was just too much for me to go out but I was in dire need, so, I just opened the zipper about an inch and stuck my extension tube through, thankfully the ground sloped away from me. I was going to chop off some of my extension cos its a bit like wrestling a fire hose but who knows when I'll need to poke it out of the tent again.Had bbq pulled pork sandwich for lunch and sat alongside the river watching the kayakers go buy, pizza for dinner and watched tv until around 9pm.","A Rufus Morgan Shelter

I also bought more Permethrin to respray my cloths and gear since I've washed them more than the recommended 6 times and have noticed more flies etc bugging me.

There is nothing else around for about 20miles...a popular bikers route called The tail of the Dragon is here also which has 318 curves in 11 miles, so there are lots of bikers at the hotel.It seems like everything from shuttle to marina is run by the resort, even a lady cleaning the bathrooms at the parking lot was later cleaning the bathrooms in the hotel.we have a lovely clean large room at the lodge/hotel and for only $69 per night.

The trail runs along the road across Fontana Dam and then into the woods and into the Smokies. What do you think was up a tree just by the black box where we had to deposite one section of our permit...a big old black bear! he was really big and very close. We hadn't even got one step on the trail and my worst fears materialized, 3 other people were in the parking lot and as I took a pic the bear started to climb down, as soon as he moved we all rushed over to the only car there though the bear went down the other way. You know, all this time I was secure in the knowledge that I would hear a bear crashing through the woods but all my illusions were shattered as we watched him walk through the forest underbrush he didn't make a sound. OMG! How am I going to hear them coming for me now if they tip toe about? Have a look at the pics..he really was big but kind of cute looking.Well after that harrowing escapade we started to walk into the Smokies, yes folks, of course it was all up hill for the first couple of hours anyway.We stopped for lunch (summer sausage and tortillas) and lo and behold standing right in front of us on the trail was another bloody bear. Richard didn't believe me ""oh! For goodness sake it's a log"" he said with derision...not with 4 legs it's not! We did as we were instructed and shouted at him, banged our hiking poles over our heads to appear bigger and that bear started to move towards us not at all scared or intimidated like we were told he would be. I grabbed my pepper spray and took the safety off and got a handful of rocks to throw at him. Richard brought out his whistle and took off his belt...I thought he was going to try to whip the bear to death but he says he took it off cos the buckle was twisted. Anyway we sure had no plan except to scare him with Richards whistle, which by the way he happened to find in the woods,I guess if that failed I would stone him to death and blind him (and probably us) with pepper spray. Richard blasted him twice with the whistle and he ambled off the path a couple of steps but still kept coming our way...very slowly and not at all scared then started to come around the side of us. We shouted and hollered and hurried up the trail away from him...I was shaking like a leaf.Not even an hour later we saw our 3rd bear..a cub that was scared and went rolling down the hill like a big ball of fur...we waited a while to make sure no siblings or angry mama bear was around. The hike was tough and it was extremely hot and humid. About half a mile from the shelter I heard a scrapping sound on a tree and Richard, who was behind me shouting ""holy shit"" a bear had slid down the tree right by Richard and as Richard shouted the bear stopped and looked at him before scurrying off into the forest. Boy! our first hike in the Smokies and we had seen 4 bears. I know irrational fears are often treated with immersion therapy but this was insane. Only one other person at camp had glimpsed a bear all day and I, who didn't want to see anything but a black behind running away was surrounded by the buggers.I'm writing this just before I go to sleep in a shelter made of logs with only 3 walls. We all (10 of us tonight) sleep with our heads towards the open air to try to avoid having the shelter mice run over our heads and in our hair.I was exhausted from the long hot hike which just seemed to go up all day and with no views which surprised me. I had been expecting wonderful views of the mountains but it really was just a walk in the (bear ridden) woods today. We did meet two fun guys from Knoxville, Keith and Anastacia, the poor girl had deep heel blisters and we met them at around 2pm and this is their first day of 7 in the Smokies.Some of the shelters have been closed because of aggressive bear activity so our hikes are longer than we wanted, tomorrow's is around 12 so I'd better put this weary anxious body to bed.

Up and out of camp a little after 8am just behind Demetri who was a guy from Newport Orleans who got to camp after dark last night with a Marine and his wife. He wasn't feeling good on the trail this morning. It was hot and sticky and nowhere to stop for lunch so we decided to walk 0.4 miles down to Russell Field shelter to have lunch. We met Anastacia and Keith who were there for lunch and to have Anastacia's blisters worked on. If we had known what the next 6.5 miles were going to be like we would have stayed the night at Russell. We climbed up to 5440 feet to the top of Rocky Top Mountain...the song rocky top Tennessee...wrong song, should be stairway to heaven it was a horrendous climb but the views were outstanding and certainly worth the climb. Then climbed straight down and straight back up Thunder mountain, aptly named since the thunder rolled as we climbed down it and storm clouds loomed. We didn't get to the shelter until 7:30pm and totally exhausted since the last mile to the shelter was so steep, as it was last night, boy was I ever pleased to see that shelter. Then, of course, to get water you had to climb up hil...yes, both ways!By the time we got water and ate it was 9:45pm. Before we even got ready for bed the mice were running all over the place. Demetri hung his pack and before he had even walked away a mouse ran in it. The Marine guy clay and his wife Melissa arrived later as did Keith and Anastacia and while they were eating the mice were running around their feet with Melissa leaping up and down shouting kill them kill them but we all just laughed, laughter tinged with hysteria for some of us.

If we had known that there was great camping along the river near a great waterfall we would have got some cold beers and camped cos it was a 1.5 mile hike on totally flat ground until the steps down to the river.We left the hostel around 9 and it was a very easy 3.5 mile hike to the bottom of pond mountain.

It was glorious hiking around the lake and over the dam, it was 3.5 miles before we started our first climb. There were aggressive bear signs everywhere- in parts we couldn't even stop to eat, the signs said hike through with no lingering. The Watauga lake shelter re-opened this year after a 2 year closure because of aggressive bear activity but it closed after a few weeks because bears were getting the food bags and ripping into tents looking for food- I guess the bears realize hikers carry their food in their backpacks now too, next the those bloody bears will realize that the signs on the trees mean no hikers stay at shelters so no food bags and they'll be taking the signs down ha! ha! We got through the area with no bear sightings.It was hot and humid and some of the streams were dry and we got word that the water at the shelter we were planning to stay at was 0.3 down a heart attack steep path so we ended up carrying 4 litres each for the last 1.7 miles needless to say I got to the shelter gasping my last, there were lots of trees down blocking the trail.

Greg needed water, it took him an hour to get 2 litres and he was soaked with sweat and red in the face.

Well omg! it took us an hour to go 8 tenths of a mile, there were trees down all over the trail, some we could walk around though we had to be careful since one side of the trail was next to a very steep drop off and sometimes you just had to take your pack off and either climb over or under since it wasn't just one tree but 3 or 4 down and all jumbled together needless to say it was very slow going and bloody hard work..yep! Still living the dream ha! Ha! We caught up with Greg during all this tree climbing and all sat and had lunch exhausted at a campsite about 2.5 miles from the shelter. Greg and I had gone to get some water and as I climbed back up from getting water standing there meowing at me was a jet black cat (see gallery pics) it was feral but couldn't be too feral since it came around us as soon as we pulled out our lunch, I was trying to remember if a black cat crossing your path was good luck or bad luck but considering the rest of the day we had I'd say it's bad luck! We had gone about 0.5 miles after lunch and it began to sprinkle with rain, the skies didn't look too dark so I just kept going but then out of the blue it just hammerred down. Well, by the time I got my pack cover on I was soaked to the skin, so wet I didn't see any point in putting on my waterproof gear.
The trail turned into a gushing stream almost immediately and by the time we got the 2 miles to the shelter my boots were oozing water out of my shoe laces but Murphy's law just 3 or 4 paces before the shelter and of course the bloody rain stopped. We wrung out our socks and hung them up then Richard and I went to look for a blue blazed trail with a rope hanging over a steep cliff...I know sounds very ominous but while we were at the Boots Off Hostel a lady called Vicki arrived, she owns the Iron Mountain B+B and she told Richard how to get down to her place from the trail- walk past the shelter to a blue blazed trail on the right then find a hanging rope and absail down, easy right? Oh so wrong!
As I said before we were drenched to the bone and while we did wring out our socks they were still soggy when we put them back on and my boots were so wet I poured out the water but in a few minutes I would be in a lovely warm spa bath if I wasn't killed trying to absail down a slippery rope, oh! And did I tell you we had a very full pack with 6 days of food and all our stuff was soaked, sleeping bags and all(so much for our waterproof pack covers) we had planned to Hike straight to Damascus, before we got soaked but now the B+B we think a warm dry bed is the way to go... 5 miles later and no blue trail or rope...we get to a road TN91...of course we have no phone signal (that bloody cats fault). Eventuallya guy driving a tractorcomes down a side road and Richardasks to borrow his phone but his battery is dead.. of course it is! Not long after a guy in a truck comes by whose phone does work and Richard gets through to the B+B but just our luck Vicki cannot pick us up cos she's going to a play but she did say she'd call around and try to find someone who could come and get us. Well we had no phone signal, it started to sprinkle again and we had waited 50 minutes - I was ready to get back on the trail and set the tent up before the storm hit- literally minutes before we were ready to give up on the ride an SUV with a lady (Val) and a little boy (Wyatt) pulled up and asked if we were Richard and Tina...Yaya! Vicki had found someone who would drive us to the most awesome B+B we have ever stayed at. We were still wet so as soon as we got there (around 8pm) I took a wonderful spa bath that was in our room then did laundry and chatted to William and Mary, a couple from Houston Texas who were also staying there on their way to Chicago to visit family.

We were screaming along and it only took us 45mins to do the 3 miles to the shelter...I know must be a record! There were lots of cow pats all over the first couple of fields we hiked through and I constantly thought about you Dawn and how scared you would have been especially just before we climbed a style to get into the woods cos there must have been at least 20 cows who came to the fence to watch us...Richard kept saying that they were watching and following me, I think he was assuming that because you were scared of cows that I would be too but I was too busy ringing my bell to ward off the bears, so I'm guessing that a fear of cows is not genetic sis...you might not be scared of bears just the cows...ha! Ha! But somehow I think you will be. Anyway, the other night when Richard was borrowing the phone from the farmer guy he told Richard to be careful cos the bears were very bad around there (TN91) and Richard said ""yes I know we've been reading all the signs"" and the guys said ""no! I mean really bad"". Of course this did nothing but make me even more paranoid than I already am. Anyway, we got to the shelter at 12:30pm and there was a guy called Pangia there trying to dry out, he had been caught in the morning rain and was soaked. Since 75% rain was forecast for the afternoon and the skies were dark and gloomy we decided we were going to stay there- only 3 miles I know but after our drenching the other day when everything in our packs got soaked, sleeping bags and everything- so lesson learned and heeded today. Pangia told us that about an hours hike north of us he came across a hiker who asked him for food and water, apparently this guy was at a campsite site just off the trail and a bear ripped his food bags to shreds and bite a hole in his water bladder that he had hanging. Oh goodness why do people tell me theverything things! I wondered if it was Greg, who said he would stay at this shelter last night but if he arrives too early he just walks on and pitches his tent wherever he is when he gets tired..Pangia described an older guy with white/grey beard and glasses but almost every hiker after the initial bubble look like that..most of the younger crowd started with the bubble in April. Pangia was headed to camp at Uncle Nick's monument tonight- uncle Nick is a famous TN hermit who'should epitaph reads ""lived alone, suffered alone, died alone"" though he's probably turning in his grave with all the hikers who go to the monument and camp the night there!","Iron Mountain B+B

However, something thought it could get at our food, we heard something running up the tree, which was right behind the shelter, we could hear it scratching at the paracord that the bag was hanging from, I would bang on the floor of the shelter and it would scurry down the tree and scamper away. No idea what it was but if I had to guess it sounded like a goblin...it scampered over the ground as if it had a limp and sounded like it had hooves and a snuffley cold...so who knows what it was but it kept coming back all night long.

We decided to fly because there was no way I was not going back on the bus, it was about 100 miles to the nearest train station and we found out that renting a car is only cheap if you return the car at the city you rented it, to return it to Maine they wanted a $400 fee on top of the rental cost.We went to the outfitters next to the restaurant and got a shuttle to take us to the La Quinta hotel in Kingsport.
