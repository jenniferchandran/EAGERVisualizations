Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523805,"Two summers ago in 2014 my daughter Kelly and I decided to hike the 100 mile wilderness in Maine, which is where we live. I suppose that's what gave us the idea to thru hike the AT together. I've dreamed of doing it since I was in high school but that was 39 years ago and it seemed like it would always remain a dream and nothing else. In the months after the 100 mile wilderness, with the encouragement of my wife and my two daughters we decided it was time for me to quit my job of three decades as a truck driver, and to pursue my dream. It wasn't quite that simple, as my wife would attest. There were plenty of times when I was on the fence about it, right up to the end. But in the end,I did quit my job and today I'm sitting at Amicalola Falls State Park on day one writing this first journal entry. All the preparation is about to be put to the test. I'm about to be put to the test. Over the past months this usually seemed like a pretty good idea. Today it feels like a great idea. We got off the train this morning in Gainesville and got a ride to Amicalola with one of the hiker shuttles, a fine gentleman named Ron Brown. I highly recommend him if you're ever in need of a similar service. When we got to Amicalola my daughter checked in as thru hiker #735 and I checked in as # 736 starting from Amicalola. Very friendly and helpful l folks here at the state park. We're taking the day off today to rest as we didn't get much sleep on the train last night and tomorrow we'll head up the approach trail to Springer, doing short days for a while until we get our ""trail legs""",,Katahdin,"Mar 17, Thu",0
Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523952,"Got up this morning at 0630 to a clear starry sky which was very nice as I was expecting a cloudy day today. After a delicious breakfast of pop tarts we set out from Amicalola on the approach trail to Springer. On the way out of the campground we met 2011 thru hiker Tick-Tock who is now doing trail work. He gave us lots of tips about the section of trail we're headed into which is much appreciated. He also told us that there are a lot of trail angels out there now doing their magic and that we probably wouldn't have to worry about going hungry for the next several days! I hope we run into some of that trail magic. We met ""Black Bear"" from Bangor today, a young man just graduated from college, who was out on his first day too. Also met Andy who just flew in from England to start the trail today. I expect we'll see them somewhere further up the trail. And now, after dining on Ramen noodles for supper, and it's starting to get a little dark under the table, it's about time to turn in. I guess it's going to rain tomorrow and turn a little colder so we'll see how that goes. I","Amicalola Falls State Park

Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524287,"We were greeted by fog and a little bit of rain this morning near the summit of Springer Mtn. with a temperature of around 45 degrees. It's now almost 1600 and we're set up for the night at Hawk Mtn. campsite. Fortunately the rain held off for most of the day, but right now it has started raining a little bit more seriously! The trail today was pretty easy going with a lot of down hill (I guess we'll pay for that eventually). We did a lot of walking through Rhododendron ""tunnels"". They aren't in bloom yet but it's still nice. Not like anything I've hiked in before at home.  We experienced our first trail magic today near Hickory Flats cemetery. Some folks from Full Moon Adventures had a couple of shelters set up and were giving out lots of snacks and hot cider and cold water to any thru hikers who cared to stop. It was very much appreciated and we got to meet Scott, Amy, Dale, Stephen and Ariane who were there doing their magic. Thanks guys!  A little bit more on Hawk Mtn. campsite. There are 30 tent pads stretched out along what seems to be a new side trail to the AT. There's been a lot of work put into this campground very recently. I think it was built to take some of the pressure off Hawk Mtn. shelter, another .7 miles north on the AT. The caretaker told us that some people from the University of New Hampshire had just put some finishing touches on the campground. Thank you to them and whoever else put in some of their time working on this campground.","Springer Mtn. Shelter

Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524289,"3/20-3/21/16 The walk from Hawk Mountain campsite to Gooch Mountain shelter yesterday was pretty uneventful. The trail hasn't been bad so far but we've got some bigger mountains coming up fairly soon. The weather yesterday turned cold and windy late in the day. We had a campsite with a fire ring so I started a fire and some people from neighboring sites came over and shared the warmth.  Today's hike from Gooch to Lance creek was quite quick...probably because we wanted to keep moving to stay warm! When we got up this morning there was snow on the ground and ice in our water bottles. We had three occasions of trail magic today. At the first one I was gifted with a shot of Jim Beam. At the second we met some folks who were out on the trail with their packs full of little bags full of candy bars and other assorted treats and were handing them out to the thru hikers they met. The third one was some ladies set up at Woody Gap (I think) and they were handing out hot food and treats and cold orange juice. I think that was the best orange juice I've ever tasted. Kelly said she hoped we'd run into someone who was giving out hot coffee, but that didn't happen today, anyways.  Tomorrow we hike to Neel Gap and our first resupply day. It'll be interesting to see how that goes.","Gooch Mountain shelter

Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524484,"3/22/16We made it to Neel Gap today and our first resupply stop. The outfitter is called Mountain Crossings and it sits beside a busy east-west two lane road. We got our food for the next four days which it turns out we don't need that much...more on that in a minute. So we sat there and had a pizza and watched the steady stream of thru hikers come through. We were going to spend the night at the Mountain Crossings hostel, take showers and do our laundry, but after we got a look around we changed our minds. This is when our first case of major indecision set in. What to do instead? We could either set up our tents out behind the place, which would have amounted to sleeping on rocks, or we could keep going up the trail in hopes of finding a better place to set up further on. The problem with that is that it was getting late and the campsites have been filling up every day as the day gets late. Eventually we decided to move on and we found a pretty good spot a couple of miles later. It's in a gap, which tend to be windy and this one is no exception but it's not quite as cold tonight so it won't be bad.  Anyways, back to having too much food to carry. So there's this nice-sounding hostel at Dicks Creek Gap which is near our next resupply, Hiawassee, GA. I was giving us four days to get there from Neel Gap. I called the hostel in Dicks Creek Gap to make a reservation for next Saturday night and guess what...all booked up already. So I made a reservation for Friday night instead. Now we have to cover four days worth of distance in three days. Hence the result of having four days worth of food to carry over a distance that will only take us three days. It's all about weight, and now we have too much. Oh well, resupply will be cheaper in Hiawassee.  Oh, I was walking along today feeling so good that I decided to sing for Kelly...a Mark Knopfler song. Not sure she enjoyed it as much as l did but there was no one else around so I don't think she was too embarassed!    You win some    You might get lucky now and then    Yeah, you win some.       MK   ","Lance Creek

Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524866,"3/23/16-3/25/16 We left Neel Gap yesterday and found a site at the top of an unnamed gap where John from Phoenix was already setting up. Being the nice guy he is he welcomed us to join him. It was very windy up there and the moon was shining brightly all night. I think I may have gotten two hours of sleep but it was all good...I still had plenty of energy for our 12 mile day on Wednesday.  On Wednesday we got going and in about 4 miles came to a place called Tesnatee Gap where a church group had trail magic set up where they were giving out snacks and sodas and small medical supplies and hand knit hats and Snickers bars (very important). These are all such nice people and it's all done out of the kindness of their hearts. Some of them travel some pretty long distances to do this every year. You have no idea how we look forward to these breaks. Thank you King Tut and friends at Tesnatee! We made it as far as Poplar Stamp Gap on Wednesday and had a nice, flat site with a fire ring. We were joined by Raudier from Belgium and by John and all sat around a campfire and cooked our supper. Another bright night but without the howling wind.  Thursday we went from Poplar Stamp to Tray Mountain shelter. Now, it's funny the things you tend to think about an talk about with your hiking partner on a long hike. A lot of the time it's food, other than the normal macaroni, rice, water and salt based things we usually eat. On Thursday it happened to be cheeseburgers and sodas. So we're walking along and come to the road at Unicoi Gap. Well, there across the road is a big trail magic setup and what do you suppose they were serving? That's right, big giant juicy cheeseburgers along with sodas, chips and of course Snickers bars! It was a dream come true. Didn't have to make our own lunch yesterday! After that we set off for Tray Mountain shelter, hoping to beat the predicted thundershowers. We decided to sleep in the shelter to keep our stuff dry. The shelter was a full house with six of us on the floor and two guys suspended above in hammocks, and one or two mice who I think are permanent residents. Oh, and one guy had his dog with him. Yeah, I didn't sleep much last night either. And it did rain but the predicted thunderstorms never materialized.  That brings us to today and our relatively short but kind of strenuous day which brought us to the Top of Georgia Hiker Hostel in Dicks Creek Gap. Very nice place. We got our first showers and they're doing our laundry for us. There's lots of thru hikers here. I think everyone's outlook improves significantly when they get a shower. We got a shuttle into Hiawassee to do our grocery shopping and to have a little restaurant food ( okay, it's a stretch to call McDonald's a restaurant). Now it's way past my bedtime. Tomorrow we finish our first state an enter North Carolina.","somewhere past Neel Gap

Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525507,"3/26/16. Dicks Creek Gap GA to Deep Gap NC   We left Top Of Georgia Hostel after breakfast this morning refreshed and clean (that doesn't last too long) with a van ride the 1/2 mile back to the trail. It wasn't long on the trail before we met with our first trail angels of the day, Encourager and Linda at Blue Ridge Gap. The food was greatly appreciated and Encourager said a thru-hiker prayer for everyone who was gathered there. A few miles later we hit a bit of a milestone for us, we crossed the state line into North Carolina. One down, thirteen more to go.  We were aiming to get to Standing Indian Shelter today when we came to Deep Gap, about a mile before the shelter. There, strung across the trail was a banner reading ""25th Annual Easter Feast"". Deciding that it was something we might want to check out we proceeded off the trail to the left and came to four parked vehicles, behind which was set up at least four E-Z Up shelters with tables and chairs and a barbecue. These folks were cooking up pulled pork, some kind of bean stew, they had Coke slaw, potato salad, several different desserts, all kinds of soda and iced tea, and they would not let anyone go away hungry. As if that weren't enough, after supper they told us all to come back in the morning so they could feed us made-to-order omelets for breakfast and then send us on our way with made-to-order sandwiches on homemade bread for lunch! They even gave us menus so we could check off our choices! Not to mention they had a nice big campfire going for everyone to sit around the whole time. Let me just say that they had so much stuff in there, all for thru hikers they never met before, that they needed a dump truck to haul it all in. I think everyone who was there was impressed an thankful for this great show of kindness. I would like to thank everyone by name or trail name: Tarheel (1979 thru), Cook, Raven (2013 thru), Repeat, Di, Weatherman, Black Hawk, Donald, Emory, Janice, Judy, Ron, Tom and Jae. Thank you all so very much for your hospitality. It will be long remembered.  So, end of today's story. Needless to say we never made it to Standing Indian Shelter on Saturday but left Deep Gap NC after our delicious Easter breakfast on Sunday. (Tarheel, I apologize but I didn't have the wild leeks on my omelet...I'm not much of an onion man)","Top of Georgia Hostel

Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525776,"3/27/16       Deep Gap to Mooney Gap                                                 Some days, well, just some days. We've had pretty good luck with the weather so far but this morning we took our tents down in the rain so everything was pretty much soaked by the time we got packed up. I still need to figure out a better system for packing up in the rain. Raudir's tent leaked so he gave it away and plans to buy a new one in Franklin. Then the best part of the day, we had our made-to-order breakfast which was very good and under shelters. After breakfast we said reluctant goodbyes to our hosts and set off on the trail. We hiked in the rain all day, which is no big deal, then when we went to find tent sites late in the day at a couple of places recommended by another hiker we met, we found that both of them had signs posted saying ""no camping"". Guess you have to be careful who you listen to! Anyways, we went a little further and found a spot big enough for two tents and set up our pre-wet stuff in the rain. Guess it won't be the last time.  Kelly has been having some problems with her knee, but she keeps on going. I haven't even had a blister yet (knock on wood). We're going to be stopping in Franklin NC tomorrow for a night in town.","Deep Gap NC

Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526844,"3/28-3/29/16 Mooney Gap to Winding Stair Gap NC Packed up this morning in cool but dry weather and headed for Winding Stair Gap and a bus ride into Franklin NC. The bus is provided by the town and it comes 11 miles up into the mountains just to pick up AT thru hikers and take them back to town to partake in the services the town offers, and it only costs three bucks a ride. Good deal, I thought. We spent the night at a place called ""Haven's Budget Inn"", and it was definitely the budget alternative. But it had a shower and real beds with clean sheets, I think. And the people who ran the place were real nice. Plus they didn't care if we hung our wet tents and sleeping bags out in front of the room. After a quick walk around town and a Domino's pizza in the room we got a night's sleep. We got up and out of the room just in time on Tuesday to be picked up by the church van of the local Baptist church and taken to their church for a free all-you-can-eat hiker breakfast of pancakes, sausage, bacon, oj, coffee and cookies. It was great! Had we been staying another day they assured us we'd be welcome back for another breakfast the next day. Such nice people. We decided to head back to the trail on Tuesday after riding around town on the really cheap local bus and doing some shopping and having lunch at Hazel P's restaurant (good lunch). It was almost 5:00 pm when we got back to the trailhead so we did a short 4.6 miles to Siler Bald where we set up camp just before a beautiful sunset and a nice star show.","Mooney Gap

Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527284,"3/30/16   Left Siler Bald this morning after a nice, cold sunrise and headed north over some moderate terrain. The day warmed up nicely and we got to Wayah Bald just in time to meet Trail Chef and his 5 year old granddaughter Emily who were just setting up some trail magic which we enjoyed with them and were very thankful. We went up the stone tower on Wayah Bald and got our first look at the Smokies, way off in the distance to the north (looked very far away!). Continuing on we came to some more trail magic at Burningtown Gap, only about a mile before our destination for the night. This was perfect since they were giving out big juicy hamburgers and cold soda and we were so well fed when we left there that we didn't have to make supper when we got to Cold Spring shelter. No cooking and no washing dishes...does it get any better?3/31/16   We left Cold Spring tent site on a day that was threatening rain. It ended up not raining until just before we got to our day's destination, the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC). This is on the Nantahala River just upstream from where it flows into Fontana Lake (one of the TVA's projects from the 1930's). The NOC is a little bit geared toward the tourist crowd, but in an outdoors way. They do a lot of whitewater rafting out of there. The Nantahala is controlled by a dam upstream so they get good water releases every day. Anyway we spent the night at NOC in some nice bunkhouses and had full use of a community room for hikers and nice showers and the place was pretty clean so it was a good rest. We had dinner at River's End Restaurant with Lucky, Lil Santa, Goat Gas and White Owl (from Belfast, Maine). The building actually hangs out over the river a little. We resupplied for a few days, at the general store (expensive) and did our laundry. There's even a railroad that runs through, a former branch line which is now a tourist railroad that runs up through the Nantahala Gorge. Didn't see any trains but we heard one the next day after we got back on the trail. 4/1/16   NOC to Brown Fork Gap shelter today. This was quite a difficult day with some tough terrain. Started out with a pretty steady uphill climb for the first eight miles from 1732 feet to 5062 feet then a lot of ups and downs for the next eight miles. We came to one spot called Jacob's Ladder and we both thought it might kill us before we got to the top! It wasn't that long, just really steep and I think we were both already pretty worn out when we got to it. 4/2/16   Brown Fork Gap shelter to Fontana Dam, NC today for a stay at the famous (among hikers, anyway) Fontana Hilton. This is a shelter on the shore of Fontana Lake that will sleep 20 people on two levels on two sides of a center passage way. It's a very nice shelter, although a little cool this night as the wind was blowing straight through the center passage way. There was a former thru hiker there when we got there setting up to grill some burgers for us and there was soda and some other beverages so once again we didn't have to make our own supper. Very much appreciated and I'm sorry I didn't get the thru hiker's name who was responsible for the trail magic but thank you very much! Then another hiker showed up and asked a couple of us to come up to his car where he presented us with a couple of bags of cold sodas and some more ""other beverages"" which we were glad to accept and share with the crowd of thru hikers. Later I got a shower which was mostly cold by the time I got there, but free, and smelly hikers can't be choosy.

Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528046,"Fontana Dam to Double Spring gap4/3/16   When thru hikers leave Fontana Dam they have to have in their possession a permit ($20.00 per person) to enter the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and they are allowed 8 days to make the 70 mile hike through the park. So with our permits in our packs we set out this morning from the Fontana Hilton and headed toward GSMNP. From the Hilton, the first thing you have to do is walk across the top of Fontana dam which is a huge concrete thing that looks to be several hundred feet high, although I'm a poor judge of distance. Let's just say it's really big and kind of creepy, to know you're walking across something holding back that much water. A little way after crossing the dam we came to the southern boundary of GSMNP and began our trek through the park. The park has a rule that everyone must stay at the shelters or if the shelters are full you must pitch your tent near the shelters. This creates a kind of an unspoken competition among hikers to be among the first to reach the shelters each day and get a spot in the shelter because the tenting around the shelters is not always that good, plus the weather was forecast to be quite cold and with the possibility of snow nobody wanted to have to pitch a tent. So we did some fast hiking through the Smokies and got through in four nights and only had to set up our tents once. Today, Sunday the 3rd, we spent the night at Spence Field shelter which is a nice location, but it was cold and snowed a little overnight! All the shelters in the Smokies are built of stone and have a covered cooking area out front. Unfortunately I didn't take a picture of one of them. 4/4/16   Today we had a 13.5 mile day with lots of ups and downs. We stayed at Double Spring Gap shelter with a spring on each side of the gap we were on. One bit of interesting trivia while we were here...a bunch of us were cooking our supper out in front of the shelter when Reading Man (from Pennsylvania ) went to light his stove, which incidentally is the same as mine. Well apparently he did it wrong because it burst into this big ball of flame and he managed to knock it on the ground and kick it out of the shelter where it sat and burned merrily as we all stood around watching it burn and waiting for it to explode. It never did explode but just burned out a full canister of gas in about two minutes. All quite entertaining. And the fun wasn't over for the day. That night while I was laying awake in the shelter ( which I do quite a lot) a mouse ran over my sleeping bag on top of my legs, so I kicked at it. A few seconds later it ran directly across my face. It left me alone after that. I guess it was mouse 1, sleeping (not) hiker, 0.","fontana dam

Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528100,"Double Spring Gap to Newfound Gap4/5/16   Woke up this to probably our coldest, windiest morning so far today. This shelter is at 5510 feet elevation and we never go below 5000 feet today. Snow again this morning. We only go 10.4 miles today, but we cross over the highest elevation on the AT today, Clingman's Dome, at 6667 feet. It's kind of strange to have been on the summit of Katahdin, and in the Presidentials so many times where you're well above tree line and very exposed and then to be on the summit of Clingman's, which is higher than any of those but tree covered and with a touristy observation tower. At any rate, the view from Clingman's is incredible in all directions and don't get me wrong, it was plenty cold and very windy up on that observation tower! We were above the clouds, but the western side of the mountains was all cloud covered and the eastern side was clear and sunny. The trees on the western side were all covered with rime ice, very pretty sight. As we hiked and the temperature warmed, the rime ice was coming off the trees like a snow storm.    We experienced trail magic twice today, once from a couple who were handing out all the treats thru hikers love, and turkey sandwiches. Then about a mile and a half later was more trail magic at Newfound Gap. A church group, the First Baptist Church of Sevierville, was handing out all kinds of good stuff. Thank you to Michael and John who were manning the van.    Newfound Gap was where we were ending our day today, but we still needed a ride the 11 miles into Gatlinburg TN where we needed to spend the night and resupply for the next four days. It just so happened that the church group was about done for the day and had an empty (cargo) van (with no seats) that was headed back to Gatlinburg. What luck! So about nine of us and our packs stuffed ourselves into the back of that van and rode down that (very twisty) mountain road into Gatlinburg. I probably don't need to tell you how that was for someone who is prone to motion sickness, but we made it to Gatlinburg without me loosing my lunch. In town, Kelly and I and Food Bag and Raudir went in together on a motel room at Microtel. It was comfy and clean, great things to thru hikers.    Gatlinburg is a bit of an assault on the senses if you've been in the woods for weeks. It's got everything your hardcore tourist could possibly want. I think we counted at least eight places where you could get your picture taken in sepia tone with old western style clothing on. And then there was the Ripleys Believe It Or Not museum and the Cars of the Stars museum and any kind of themed restaurant you could imagine...you get the picture. Tourist city, USA. We had a Five Guys burger and then went to Ben and Jerry's, at Food Bag's request. After that we all needed to go to a grocery store to resupply and that turned into quite an oddessy in itself. We ended up walking about two and a half miles to the grocery store only to find out when we got there that the town bus could've taken us there for fifty cents! Oh well, we'll know better next time. There's our experience with Gatlinburg, TN in a nutshell.","Double Spring Gap

I almost didn't get on the van because there were more people than the van would hold and all the people who arrived after me crowded onto the van before me. Fortunately Kelly and Food Bag spoke up for me and guilted one person into getting off the van so I could get on. We made it to Tri Corner Knob shelter today on a cold and very windy day, to find the shelter full. So we had to set up our tents on some pretty poor, sloping sites. 4/7/16   Left Tri Corner shelter for our last day in the Smokies. Everyone is anxious to get out of GSMNP so they can tent where they want. We made it to a hostel called Standing Bear Farm in Hartford, TN. This is a rustic, friendly place with porta-potties for bathrooms and a genuine washboard and wringer for laundry facilities. We tented in the back yard and I spent some time at the campfire where Lumpy, one of the proprietors, gave me a beer and there was good conversation and it was most relaxing. 4/8/16   Went from Standing Bear Farm to Roaring Fork shelter today. Along the way we climbed a mountain called Snowbird where there was an FAA facility on top. This was very interesting to me because of my interest in aviation. Later we crossed the famous Max Patch which is a large bald with views in all directions. It was so cold and windy up there we didn't stay long.","Newfound Gap

Then we came to Garenflo Gap where we met up with some great trail magi being given out by Buzz and Tandem, a father-daughter team who thru hiked in 2014. They came up from the Atlanta area to this little dirt road in the mountains to hand out stuff to hikers and being former thru hikers, they knew just what to bring...soda, beer, hot dogs, chips, Little Debbie and other stuff high in sugar and calories. After that it was a quick 6.5 miles to Hot Springs NC and the hostel called Laughing Heart Lodge. This is also where we took our first zero day, on the 10th. Hot Springs is a small town but the trail runs right down the main road through town so the town is very hiker-friendly. Our first order of business after getting settled in at the hostel was to go downtown to the laundry mat and do our laundry. So we get there and put our clothes and soap and money in the washing machine and push the money in and what do you suppose happens? That's right, exactly nothing! This being an unattended laundry mat, I would have called the phone number on the wall except that there is no ATT phone service in Hot Springs. So I decide to wander around town until I can find a friendly business that is open so I can borrow their phone and call the number. Fortunately there was one right across the street, except when I got there I discovered I had only written down part of the phone number. That was okay though because the nice lady at the business I was at said ""that's alright, you don't need to call the number. Just go down the street to Tobacco Road (a convenience store) and talk to whoever is there, they also own the laundry mat"". So I walk about a block to Tobacco Road and go inside to explain my plight to the nice older gentleman behind the counter. He says to wait a few minutes until his daughter gets back and he'll go right down to the laundry mat and take a look. I thank him profusely and start to walk out the door and he says ""get right in to that pickup there"" and within a couple of minutes we're on our way back to the laundry and I feel just like one of the locals riding down Main Street in this old beat up pickup truck. It was great! When we get to the laundry the guy goes in and flips a switch in the circuit breaker box, and we're back in business! Then the owner sits a spell and chats with Kelly and I and then goes about his business. I though the whole experience was rather amusing, and was impressed by the friendliness of the people.    While our laundry was in, we went to a local tavern called Spring Creek Tavern and had some really good burgers and I had a good local beer. Keep in mind that we were both dressed in just our rain gear because everything else was in the laundry. Rain gear alone doesn't do much to keep you warm in a chilly breeze!   Next day, our zero day, was pretty laid back. We dried out our tents(Kelly's dried while she napped in it) and did our resupply shopping. Later we went to dinner at the same tavern with Food Bag, Raudir, Candyman, Jimminy Cricket and Spiderman. The buffalo chicken sandwich was even better than the hamburger the night before. Then back to the hostel for one more night of sleeping in a real bed before hitting the trail again tomorrow. 4/11/16   Left Hot Springs today with some nice views back over town and over the French Broad River, which we hiked alongside for a while. We hiked with Candyman, who was doing some slack packing, for a while then we caught up with Jimminy Cricket who was headed to the same hostel we were, so we stayed together for the rest of the day. When we got to the hostel we found out it was closed so we had to continue on to the next usable tent sites. Fortunately that wasn't too far. 4/12/16   Woke up to rain this morning, or maybe I should say I got up to rain this morning, since I was already awake due to dogs barking nonstop all night at a nearby house. We hiked all day in the rain but it finally cleared at the end of the day so we were able to get most of our stuff dried out when we got to Flint Mountain shelter. 4/13/16   Flint Mountain Shelter to Low Gap tent sites. 4/14/16   A 20.8 mile day today so we could make it from Low Gap to Erwin, TN where we would stay at Uncle Johnny's Hiker Hostel. High mileage days are not too bad if the terrain isn't too difficult but today we went from 4300 feet down to 1673 feet with a lot of ups and downs along the way and I was pretty beat by the end of the day!","Roaring Fork Shelter

Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529590,"Erwin TN to Clyde Smith Shelter4/15/16   We arrived in Erwin late yesterday after a long day and we checked in at Uncle Johnny's Nolichucky Hostel and Outfitters. It's a very friendly and laid back place. It's located right across the road from the Nolichucky River which is a good sized river that's wide and fast running but not too deep. The old Clinchfield Railroad runs up the other side of the river which was a plus for me, even though the only trains went through in the middle of the night so I didn't get to see them. They sounded like they were going through about twenty feet from my tent though!    Anyway, we pitched our tents in the back yard at Uncle Johnny's because we didn't want to stay in the bunkrooms and we took another zero day on the 15th because we liked the place. Another big attraction at Johnny's are the $.40 cent Snickers bars...just can't get enough of them!   The hostel provides three free shuttles in to town every day at 0830, 1230 and 1730 for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We took the 1230 to town today which drops you off at Pizza Plus restaurant (all you can eat, 1100-1400) and right next to two grocery stores so you can resupply. The pizza wasn't great but there was a lot of it! Later we took the dinner shuttle to town and were dropped off, along with a bunch of other hikers, in front of a Mexican restaurant called Los Jalapeños. It was the real thing, we even had a waiter who could barely speak English but we all managed to place our orders, including some very large Margaritas (or two). After dinner, some of our group had to go resupply at the Walmart next door which was apparently an interesting experience after two giant margaritas. Then it was back to Johnny's for a few cheap Snickers bars. 4/16/16   Today we had to wait at the hostel for the mail to arrive because Kelly was waiting for a new pair of shoes being sent from home. Her originals had holes in them after only 340 miles. So because we had to wait we went to town for more all-you-can-eat pizza. As a result, we got a late start on the trail today, at 1440. We had a short hiking day of only 8.4 miles and camped at a place called Indian Grave Gap. 4/17/16   We went over a couple of very scenic balds today and over Unaka Mountain which has a long stretch of sense spruce forest over the summit, a nice break from the so-far leafless hardwood forest we've been mostly going through. Arrived at Clyde Smith Shelter today, mile 368.3.","Erwin TN

Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529709,"Clyde Smith Shelter to Kincora Hostel4/18/16   Today dawned clear and warm and we had a couple of big, long climbs ahead of us, the highest being Roan Mountain, also the location of Roan High Knob Shelter, the highest shelter on the AT at the elevation of 6193 feet. After that we crossed a series of balds with great views which, along with two more we'll cross tomorrow are collectively known as the Roan Highlands. Our destination today is a shelter called Overmountain Shelter which is an old barn that has been converted to a shelter for hikers. A lot of people we know are headed there today just because we all think it would be pretty cool to sleep in an old barn. When we got there Kelly decided to stay in her tent out in the grassy field by the barn, under the nearly full moon. Probably a good choice. I elected to sleep in the barn on the second floor which I assume was once a hay loft. I didn't sleep very well and was visited by mice in the night but at least I can say I stayed in the barn on the AT. I did have to get up in the night to go outside and pee in the bushes and the sky was absolutely beautiful! 4/19/16   Left Overmountain for a couple more big climbs over Little Hump and Hump Mountains, two more balds with great views in all directions. It was on this first climb of the day that we noticed smoke off to our northwest. We figured it was another controlled burn which they have been doing around here to clear the forest floor and help prevent forest fires. We could see the smoke for most of the day. A little more on that later.    I visited Jones Falls today, a very high and pretty waterfall and we hiked along the Elk River which was very pretty too. The rewards for our work out here seem to never end. We reached a couple of small milestones today too. First we crossed the NC/TN state line for the last time so that's two states down and twelve to go. Second, we reached the 400 mile mark today. It's the little things, you know? 4/20/16   We tented at Mountaineer Shelter last night. After leaving this morning we went about five miles when we ran in to the first excitement of the day. We came to USFS 293, a gravel forest service road. There we were met by a couple of Forest Service employees in pickup trucks and the trail, where it re-entered the woods on the other side of the road, was blocked off with signs and caution tape. If you recall the smoke I mentioned we saw yesterday, it turned out to be a wildfire that was one of several they believe were deliberately set, or at least accidentally set by people. This one was threatening the AT so they closed a seven mile section and detoured us around on the forest service road which basically paralleled the AT for the seven miles. When we got around to the other end of the detour they let us continue on the AT but we were apparently the last ones they let through for the next six hours because the next day when we saw people who had been right behind us, they had been held for several hours where we were allowed to continue. We saw and smelled smoke for the rest of the day and watched helicopters carrying water to the fire. We ended the day at Kincora Hostel in Hampton TN, owned and run by Bob Peoples, somewhat of a legend in AT building and maintenance. Bob only charges $5.00 a night at his hostel and he's a super nice guy. I really enjoyed sitting around his table with him and hearing his stories. He knows more about the trail than anyone I've ever met, I think. He also has seventeen cats, all strays, and one deaf dog. In the afternoon Bob took us to downtown Hampton in his pickup on a re-supply run to Brown's Grocery, an interesting little rural grocery store with a little bit of everything but not a lot of anything. It got the job done, though.","Clyde Smith Shelter

Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531118,"Kincora Hostel to Damascus 4/21/16   From Kincora Hostel we walked down the road .3 miles to get back on the trail and very soon we entered the gorge of the Laurel Fork River. Very nice area with a big waterfall. At one point, the trail follows a narrow rock ledge between the river and the wall of the gorge. At several places up near the top of the gorge the trail follows what appears to be an old railroad grade with some fairly deep rock cuts. I don't know what the railroad would have been used to haul, but it's long gone now.    We came to US Highway 321 and after taking our lives in our hands getting across the road we were on the shore of Watauga Lake, another TVA reservoir. From this point to just beyond Watauga Dam, all camping has just recently been prohibited due to bear activity. After a two year closure camping had been re-opened on this three mile stretch but a couple of bears came and tore open people's tents to get at food left inside (a big no-no) so they had to close the area to camping again. Now they want hikers to go through the area without even stopping to eat. We were happy to oblige.    We ran into a little trail magic today. After we crossed the dam we found a cooler of cold soda beside the trail a little way into the woods. Very nice of someone to carry that in there.    Ended our day today at Vandeventer Shelter where the view behind the shelter was great but the water source was .3 mile away and down a very steep trail. I made sure I got all the water we needed in one trip. We squeezed seven people into the six person shelter because rain was forecast for the overnight and nobody wanted to take down a tent in the rain in the morning. 4/22/16, end mileage 458.6   We got on the trail in the rain this morning and did 11.4 miles in the rain over some pretty easy terrain. That brought us to TN highway 91 where there was some trail magic waiting for us. To be fair, our speed this morning was also due to the fact that we knew about the trail magic the day before and not much will make us go faster than the promise of cold sodas and Krispy Kreme donuts. The first trail magi we came to was a cooler full of soda and snacks left by a local church just before the road crossing. Very welcome, and thank you to the church. The second magic was at the parking lot by the road, where Mary, the wife of Nail Gun, one of the thru hikers we were with at the shelter the night before, was waiting for us in the rain with a real feast of carbs, which we all happily devoured. This one included the previously mentioned Krispy Kremes. It was hard dragging ourselves away from that, let me tell you! But we did, and by then the rain had let up some. We crossed the road and immediately went in to a pasture for some scenic rural hiking.    6.5 miles after highway 91 we crossed another road at Low Gap (there's a lot of Low Gaps on the trail). Some nice folks who drove down from Indiana had a couple of shelters set up here and were giving out hamburgers, hot dogs, beer, soda, and a whole bunch of desserts. They were all former thru hikers so they knew what to bring. This is something they do every year, just because they like to. After we ate our fill again there we reluctantly dragged ourselves away again and went on to Abingdon Gap Shelter and tented for the night. We had a thunderstorm during the night but after that it cleared up. 4/23/16 end mileage 469.0   Today we had a short day, just 10 miles to Damascus, VA. During the day we completed another state when we crossed from Tennessee in to Virginia. It will be a while before we complete another state because over 500 miles of the trail is in Virginia. We set up our tents in the back yard of a place called Woodchuck Hostel and it turned out to be a really nice place. There's a house with rooms you can rent and a couple of small cabins out back with bunks in them, in addition to the big lawn where all the renters set up. And in the morning they serve up a nice breakfast of waffles, fried potatoes, juice and all the cereal you can eat. They also have a pavilion out back with a grill where you can cook your own burgers if you want. And they had probably the best shower of any hostel I've stayed at so far.    Kelly an I went out and did our resupply and then went out for dinner at a restaurant called Bobo McFarlands. It was a nice place and the burgers were good. The fries left a little to be desired.    One little side note on how not to operate an ATM when you do a withdrawal. So I went to this bank's ATM to get some cash out of my account and the money came out just fine. As I was writing this down in my register before I took my money from the machine, the machine started making noises and took my money back in, but it didn't credit it back to my account. Now it's a week and a half later as I write this and I still haven't gotten my money back. So I guess the lesson is...take the money out of the machine first, then write it down, especially when you're at a different bank's ATM. Rant and rave over. 4/24/16   Spent a zero day in Damascus doing not much. Walked around town a little. Took another shower because I could. Cooked burgers on the grill for supper.","Hampton TN

Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531245,"Damascus to Old Orchard Shelter4/25/16   Departed Woodchuck hostel and Damascus mid-morning today. We hiked the AT for a ways until we came to a detour where a bridge was washed out. We were detoured on to the Virginia Creeper trail which is built on an old railroad grade and so is basically flat. The detour was actually shorter than the trail, and very scenic so it didn't bother me. Saw some nice old railroad bridges too! 4/26/16 end mileage 509.0   We left our campsite today for what looked like it would be a fairly easy day, at least as far as the difficulty of the terrain was concerned. Looks can be quite deceiving. It was very rocky for a lot of the way and very hard on the feet. We were definitely ready to be done after 22.8 miles. We reached 500 miles today.    Going over Whitetop Mountain today we met three ladies, Nancy, Jane and Curly, who wanted to know all about our hike and to take our picture. Curly is a triple crowner, which means she has hiked the AT, the Pacific Crest Trail and the Continental Divide trail, starting with the AT in 1992 when she was 51 years old. Quite an accomplishment, I think! Before we parted the ladies told us they had left a cooler full of sodas and snacks down by the trailhead, for thru hikers. This caused us to quicken our steps for the next couple of miles until we got to the parking area. Thank you ladies!   On to Grayson Highlands after that, with its famous feral ponies. This is where the trail got really rocky. I had this image of Grayson Highlands as a big open grassy meadow with ponies grazing everywhere but that's not exactly how it is. Sure, it's open and grassy in some places but it's also really rocky and rough going. There are the ponies, though. Some people even saw longhorn cattle, but we didn't see any. I did get a free beer as we were leaving the highlands, from a gentleman who was camping there.    We ended the day at Old Orchard Shelter. This is an old shelter made of logs with big spaces between them. Apparently this is quite attractive to certain rodents, as we were awakened in the wee hours of the morning by a flying squirrel chewing on the inside of the shelter. Then after he was done I guess it was time for the mice to take over because I could hear the pitter-patter of little feet all around me until dawn.    Before I went to bed I laid on the picnic table and looked up at the stars appearing as the sun set. I felt an intense sense of loss as I thought about how I used to do the same thing with a friend who can no longer do this. I remember camping with him in Crawford Notch and at Baxter State Park and looking up at the stars through the opening in the trees above the campsite as we sat around the fire. Not sure if I'll ever be able to do this with him again, but I sure hope so. I sure hope so, my friend.","Damascus VA

Everyone wanted to get there though, mainly because you can order pizza with the phone at the nearby visitors center and have it delivered to the shelter. So it was a full shelter and we all had a good time eating pizza from Pizza Hut. Another attraction is that this shelter has a shower. It so happens that it only has cold water, so cold that it gives you brain freeze almost instantly. You don't stand there under the running water. You get wet, shut off the water, soap up and then rinse off...very quickly.    Slept pretty well in this shelter. No rodents, either. 4/28/16 end mileage 550.6   Today we hit trail magic at a little old one room school house turned into a museum. The building was just left open and a sign directed hikers inside for cold sodas and other high calorie stuff. This was provided by the West End United Methodist Church in Wytheville, VA.    Later we came to the town of Atkins where we did a small resupply and had lunch at a place called The Barn, with a menu item called the ""hiker burger"". This was listed in the trail guide so a lot of us were anxious to get there and have a hiker burger. I had one and it was really big, but I didn't have any trouble eating the whole thing and all the fries that came with it.    After Atkins we walked through some very nice, well kept farm fields. I like this kind of scenery. At the 547 mile mark today we came to a sign announcing that we were 1/4 of the way to Katahdin.

Today we have a stop scheduled at Trent's Grocery for a small resupply and hopefully a shower and laundry. That's about 16 miles into the day.    We hiked until we crossed Kimberling Creek today on a nice big footbridge and this put us at VA 606, the road that Trent's Grocery is on. Wouldn't you know it but there was trail magic waiting for us at the road! A couple whose names are Beth and Bernie had come up from Florida on their vacation and were set up and giving out sodas, sandwiches, and high-calorie treats like Little Debbie, just because they wanted to. They're not even hikers! Very nice people, and then Bernie gave Caboose, Spiderman and me a ride the half mile up the road to Trent's Grocery.    Trent's Grocery is a small grocery store out in the middle of nowhere which also has a campground, of sorts, with showers and a laundry facility, of sorts. The showers were very dirty and not well maintained, but we were dirtier so we used them anyway. Caboose ended up getting a cold shower because the washing machine was going at the same time, and so was my shower which mysteriously remained hot! The washer and dryer worked okay and we dried out our gear on the lawn while we waited for the laundry to finish. Then we decided to go in the store and order a pizza. By the time we were done with all this, five hours had elapsed since we arrived at the store and we still had to find a place to camp for the night. So we set off back on the trail and hiked two more miles, the last of it in the dark until we got to Dismal Falls where we set up in the dark. There's only one thing worse than trying to find a good branch and throw a bear line over it and that's doing it in the dark! We had quite a thunderstorm in the night and it seemed to cross right directly overhead. 5/2/16 end mileage 634.6   Woke up this morning to a wet tent because of the rain in the night but the sky appeared to be clear above a low lying layer of fog. Packed everything up wet and headed out. Since we were near Dismal Falls but hadn't see them in the dark the night before we went down to take a look at the falls. They were certainly not dismal but quite impressive after the night's rain and I'm glad we made the short detour down to see them. After that we got going with Spidey and the trail was quite wet for most of the day. There was a lot of water flowing in the woods that I think is not normally there and you could hear running water most of the time. As the sun burned off the fog, the woods came alight with sparkling drops of water on everything. It was a nice day for hiking even though the trail was muddy and like a brook in many places.    We were headed for the town of Pearisburg VA today and it was our longest day yet, 24.5 miles to the road in to town and then another .9 miles uphill in to town. It had clouded over in the last few miles and the clouds opened up and poured on us as we reached the road. By the time we reached our motel we were soaked, but we still had a lot to do before bed. We had to get supper, do our laundry and shop for food before bed. We got all that done but I still didn't get to bed until after midnight and we had to get up at 0630 in the morning to get on the trail. It turned out that all the rushing around was unnecessary though, because when we got up in the morning we decided to take a zero day in Pearisburg. 5/3/16   Since we decided to zero today I was able to relax and have a little fun. We had a late breakfast at Hardee's where we ran into Seabiscuit, Food Bag and Learning Curve, who I hadn't met before. After breakfast we all went to DQ and had Blizzards. While we were outside the restaurant talking and eating our Blizzards I happened to mention that I might have a Twisted Tea back at the motel later. Presently, Learning Curve disappeared and soon returned from the store next door with a bag. He opened it up and said to me ""take your pick"". It contained two 24 oz. cans of Twisted Tea! I was more than happy to go back to the motel and have a drink on the patio in the sun with my new friend. In fact, I later went back to the store and got a couple more to share. Then someone brought out the card game ""Apples to Apples"" and a bunch of us sat around and played that for a while. Later on, some of us got hungry and went across the road to an all-you-can-eat Chinese restaurant called ""Lucky Star"" and ate way more than we needed to (that's no small task for thru hikers!).","Helvey's Mill Shelter

As soon as we entered the woods and began to climb we could see the aftermath of a violent hail storm that had passed through two days before. It missed Pearisburg but we could see the damage on the trail almost all day. There was leaf debris and small branches all over the ground and some of the trees looked like they'd had their leaves almost completely stripped. I had talked with some hikers the day before who had been caught out in the storm and some of them had had their tents destroyed by the hail the size of golf balls.    The weather was pretty good most of the day but by the time we got to our shelter, Pine Swamp Branch, it was looking like it would rain soon so the shelter was full shortly after we got there. This is a nice shelter and we had a good crowd of fun hikers so we had a good time there. This turned out to be the last we would see of Learning Curve because I learned a couple of days later that he hurt his leg or foot and had to get off the trail for a while. 5/5/16 end mileage 672.6   Today is my Mom's birthday. Happy birthday Mom. I hope it was a good one!   We left Pine Swamp Branch Shelter in a steady rain, looking at an 18.5 mile day. Not only was it raining but the temperature had dropped considerably during the night. Some of the people in the shelter were considering taking a zero day there because of the weather. That may have been a wise decision. The first thing Caboose and I had to do was a 1700 foot climb and the higher we got, the lower the temperature dropped. It wasn't long before the rain had turned into a steady snow and was collecting on the ground. We were both already wet and I got so cold that I couldn't work my fingers correctly and was shivering quite a bit. We eventually went back down that mountain and warmed up a little. I thought we should stop at the first shelter we came to and just get in our sleeping bags and get warm. But caboose talked me out of it anod so we pressed on over another mountain but this time there was no more snow and we got to Laurel Creek Shelter without freezing. There were times today that I was really afraid one of us might develop hypothermia if we didn't get warmed up. What really got me through the day was repeating my friend Betsy's advice to myself: ""you will get warmer"" and ""you will get dry"". Thanks Betsy. 5/6/16 end mileage 695.1   Today dawned a little foggy but it cleared off and turned into a nice day. Early on in the day we hiked through some very nice farm country and through some pastures with cattle in them. We passed the largest oak tree on the trail in the south, which is called the Keffer Oak. Then we crossed the Eastern Continental Divide, where the water on the west side flows to the Gulf of Mexico and on the east side it flows to the Atlantic. Then we came to the Audie Murphy Monument, a monument to the man who was the most decorated veteran of the Second World War. The monument was put up by the VFW near the site where Audie Murphy died in a plane crash in 1971.    Today's destination was Pickle Branch Shelter. It looked like a normal shelter but according to the shelter log it was full of mice and big spiders. This discouraged everyone from sleeping in it but me. So I had the whole shelter to myself...and the mice, who started having a little party as soon as I went to bed. And of course, not being a big fan of spiders I decided to just not look for them. But I did have to keep my sleeping bag zipped all the way up and sometimes my head under the covers just to ensure that the vast herds of marauding giant arachnids didn't attack me. Of course, I never actually saw a spider, but the suggestion was there and that's all I needed. So I spent a hot, sweaty, mostly sleepless night based on what somebody had written in the shelter log.","Pearisburg VA

This was only a 17 mile hike and not too difficult for the most part but we crossed a couple of significant landforms along the way. The first one is called Dragon's Tooth and its a giant slab of tilted stone that's about forty feet high and angled at about 75 degrees. Very impressive, and very popular with the tourists and day hikers on this Saturday morning. The northbound hike down from Dragon's Tooth was very steep, with some iron rungs stuck in the rocks in places. Not an easy descent with a 35 lb. pack on your back.    We came to VA 624 and walked the .3 miles to Catawba Grocery where we had been anticipating some good junk food and we were not disappointed! After we ordered a pizza and went outside to wait for it, a man approached us and asked us if we were thru hikers. When we told him we were, he handed us each a Snickers ice cream bar and told us that he had started a thru hike this year but had to stop when he got hurt. His trail name is Sam Squared and he is such a nice guy! Thanks to Sam for his act of kindness. Also got to talk with Strider and Magellan, a son and father 2016 thru hiking team. Hope to see more of them up the trail. And many thanks to Jarrod, current thru hiker, and his girlfriend who came down from New York to spend a couple days with him, for their trail magic at the 624 road crossing.    Headed north again and ran into more trail magic from Medicine Man, another current thru hiker who is off the trail for a few days while his dog's paw heals. Then it was off from the VA 311 parking lot toward the second significant landform of the day, McAfee Knob, about 4 miles distant. From what I understand, this is the most-often photographed spot on the AT. It certainly was popular on this Saturday afternoon because there was a steady stream of people on the trail, most of them headed down as it was getting late in the afternoon. Caboose and I managed to take the wrong trail and ended up doing about a mile of extra hiking to get back to where we should have turned. We got to McAfee Knob and had time for a few pictures before leaving for the last .7 miles to Campbell Shelter. 5/8/16 end mileage 727.5   Short day today, only 15.4 miles to Daleville VA. Deceptively short though because a lot of it was ridge walking and very rocky and hard on the feet. We had good weather though. We got to US 220 in Daleville, turned right, walked about 200 feet and arrived at the Howard Johnson Express motel where we had a reservation and I had a package waiting for me containing my summer sleeping bag and a couple of short sleeve t-shirts. There were a lot of other thru hikers staying there too. We shared our room with Shoe, Seabiscuit and Food Bag. After we got settled in and got our laundry done all five of us met up with Spidey and Mismatch and walked down to the nearby Cracker Barrel restaurant for supper. Getting across US 220 and negotiating the US 220-interstate 81 interchange on foot was an interesting exercise in self-preservation. Even more so on the way back in the dark. After supper we still had time to go to the 24 hour Kroger for our resupply. 5/9/16 end mileage 746.0   Had our continental breakfast at the motel this morning and I'm not sure how they can feed all those hikers, who eat twice as much as the normal motel guest. Don't care though, as long as they don't run out of food! After breakfast Caboose and I and the group we had supper with the night before all had to go back to the shopping center. I had to mail home some items including my winter sleeping bag and a broken camera. I think I may have shed a couple of pounds from my pack. We didn't get back on the trail until 1100 for an 18.5 mile hike to Bobblet's Gap Shelter. Today was my turn to push the speed pretty hard over some relatively easy terrain to finish 18.5 miles in six and a half hours. We crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway for the first time of many today. It was deserted, apparently a section of it closed for some kind of road work. At the shelter we met NOBOs Speilberg, Kelsey and AB. Speilberg is keeping a video record of his thru hike and you can see his work by searching ""Craig's Appalachian Trail thru hike"" on YouTube. Some good stuff. Another fellow who was in the shelter this night had a habit of drinking beer, eating corn chips, farting and snoring at various intervals throughout the night. So that made things pleasant. Enough said.","Pickle Branch Shelter

Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533408,"Bobblet's Gap Shelter to the James River5/10/16 end mileage 764.4   Uneventful day today. Lots of ups and downs. There was a real nice looking swimming hole where we crossed Jennings Creek on a road bridge. Looked like a pretty good trout stream to me, too. We arrived at Cornelius Creek Shelter to find only two people already there, so we parked our stuff in the shelter because rain was approaching...again. We had the pleasure of meeting Bombadil and Goldberry whose shelter log entries I'd been reading for a while. I found Bombadil's banter to be quite entertaining. Shortly, Speilberg arrived and then just as the rain started, Seabiscuit showed up to make it a full shelter.    A little while later I went for a walk on a trail behind the shelter and found we were only a three minute walk from a paved road with traffic on it. No mention in the guidebook about having pizza delivered, though. 5/11/16 end mileage 784.3   This morning was a little sad because as we were preparing to leave the shelter we had to say what may be our last goodbye to Seabiscuit as he is going to be continuing on up the trail while Caboose and I take five days off. We've been hiking with him almost since day one. Seabiscuit generally hikes a little faster than we do so it won't take him long to get a good distance ahead of us and it's not likely that we'll catch up to him. Raudir, my friend, I wish you safe and happy travels.    On Apple Orchard Mountain today we passed another FAA communication facility. I don't know if other hikers find these things interesting but I do. This one looked like a giant volleyball mounted on top of a tower. After passing the FAA tower we came to a rock formation known as The Guillotine which is a narrow passage between two vertical rocks with another boulder suspended between them by almost nothing. It makes you glance up nervously to make sure nothing moves overhead as you walk underneath. Typical of the weather we've been having lately, we could hear a thunderstorm approaching as we got within a couple of miles of our destination today. By the time we reached the James River it was raining steadily but I didn't mind because I was so enthralled by the size and beauty of the river, which we had to follow downstream for a mile before we crossed it. The AT crossing of the James is on a bridge which is the longest foot-traffic-only bridge on the AT. It's a steel truss bridge built on the piers of a former railroad bridge. The railroad now crosses the river a few hundred feet downstream on a newer bridge built on a straighter alignment. I got a little bonus when a stack train with CSX power went by at speed on the other side of the river just before I crossed. Okay, sometimes it doesn't take much to amuse a rail fan. Once Caboose and I got across the river there was a shuttle driver who we hired waiting to take us to The Troutdale post office to begin the next part of our adventure.","Bobblet's Gap Shelter

Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533437,"James River to a few days off and Trail Days5/11/16   This entry is a continuation of our day on 5/11. So we were picked up by the shuttle driver on US 501 by the James River this afternoon and he transported us back to Troutville which is right next to Daleville where we had been on the 9th. Here, our trail boss (and my wife) Maria had arranged to have us picked up by a friend she knew in high school back in Ohio, and hasn't seen since then! Talk about connections! Amy Fletcher, who lives with her husband Jim in a beautiful house in Daleville, met us at the Troutville post office and took us to their home for a very nice steak dinner, showers and a night in a comfy bed. After dinner we had some pleasant conversation and a few beers before bed. These gracious hosts even offered to put me up for the entire five days that Caboose was going to be in Maine but since I was hell-bent on getting to Trail Days I declined the offer. At any rate, I greatly appreciated the hospitality shown to me by these nice folks who didn't know me or Caboose from the next guy on the street. 5/12/16   We got up early this morning so Amy could drive us to the airport in Roanoke (on her day off) and drop Caboose off for her 0800 flight to Maine. Then I rode back to Daleville with Amy where she dropped me off at the same Howard Johnsons that I stayed in before. I figured that if I couldn't get a ride to Trail Days, at least I could get a room there and try again tomorrow. So time kept dragging on and it looked like I wouldn't get a ride, so I ended up renting a room. I was in the room wasting time when I decided to check my e-mail. What I discovered was a message from Aaron Megquier, chairman of Friends of Baxter State Park, and a phone message from Dick Klain, president of FOBSP. They had been trying to contact me to offer me a ride to Trail Days in Damascus where they were going to have a booth set up. I called Dick and it turned out he was at that moment in Glasgow VA waiting for me to show up in town off the trail! I told him I was in Daleville and in no time he showed up at the Howard Johnson (in his very nice all-electric Tesla) and picked me up. Talk about luck! We stopped in Wytheville at the next charging station and got a bite to eat while the car was charging and then off to Damascus.    We had two bunks at ""The Place"",a church run hostel, reserved for us. After we got settled in Dick went down to the FOBSP booth and I went around town checking out all the other Trail Days stuff. Later on we went to Bobo McFarland's for some great burgers and a good live band. I was surprised to meet Carey Kish,aka Beerman (1977,2015 thru) coming out the door of Bobo's as we entered. Hard to believe I was actually at Trail Days! 5/13/16   Today is the official start of Trail Days so I got up early, went and got some free coffee and cookies with Dick and then went wandering around town seeing all the sights. There was a lot to see, and if anyone walks away from this hungry whether they have money or not, it's their own fault! There's free food all over the place. I took my backpack, which needed repair, up to the free repair area and got it fixed. They did a nice job too. Probably better than original. I met David Miller, author of ""AWOL On The Appalachian Trail"" and ""The A.T. Guide"", the book that most thru hikers carry on the trail, myself included. I also met Zach Davis, author of ""Appalachian Trials"", a book full of good advice on how to handle the psychological hardships that sometimes rear their ugly head while on a long distance hike. I caught up with Spiderman and Food Bag today. Glad to see some familiar faces. I also saw Lucky, Little Santa, and Goat Gas, all of whom I last saw at the Nantahala Outdoor Center. It's great to see them again. Later in the day I watched an eating contest. The first six people had five minutes to eat six hot dogs each. It must be harder than it looks because no one finished their six hot dogs. The second six people had five minutes to eat a whole cake each. The twist is that they weren't allowed to use their hands. I got some good pictures of guys with cake all over their face. Quite entertaining. 5/14/16   Saturday, day two of Trail Days. Went down to the fire station with Dick for some breakfast. The breakfast was good but I could have eaten three times as much. It's for a good cause though. I walked around town for a while after breakfast and ate more free food then back to the hostel until about noon to work on my journal entries. At noon I went to the other end of town for some free hot dogs and saw Dirty D and Buckles, a thru hiking couple who I hadn't seen in a while. This is also where the start of the hiker parade was. The hiker parade is just what it sounds like... There's a few fire trucks and sponsors followed by hundreds of thru hikers, from both past years and presently on the trail, who walk through town on the Main Street. The catch here is that people on the side are allowed, actually encouraged to bring giant water guns to the parade to soak the passing hikers. Not to be out done though, some of the hikers bring their own giant water guns and shoot back at the crowds on the side. I saw Buckles stalking through the thru hikers and staging quick, precision attacks on the crowds. Very entertaining and all in good fun. After the parade I met the Hiking Viking, somewhat of an icon this year for starting a southbound thru hike in January and finishing at Springer in May, and blogging about it the whole way.    Went to supper with Dick again at Bobo's and while we were there Food Bag, Cheeks and Wook came in. Haven't seen Wook since the Easter Feast and he didn't have a trail name then. This was karaoke night at Bobo's and Food Bag, Cheeks and another hiker whose name I didn't get decided to do a little number on stage. I got some good pictures and video of that. 5/15/16   Today Dick was returning back north so I caught a ride with him back to Roanoke to a motel near the airport where I'll be meeting up with Caboose tomorrow so we can get back on the trail. Dick, thanks for the rides. I had fun hanging out with you. Safe travels!","US 501, James River crossing

Resupply shopping is all done for the next section of the trail so hopefully we'll get shuttled back to the trailhead in time to make a few miles today.    The one thing of significance I do have to say is that this is the first time in many weeks, maybe ever, that I've been caught up, right to the day, with my journal. Not to worry however. I don't expect that will last more than a day or two at the most!   Now, let me get out of this boring motel and back on the trail.","Off the trail for a few days

Sweeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536293,"James River to The Priest Shelter5/16/16 end mileage 786.0   Just to finish up today, we got back on the trail at the James River. Trek aroma was just coming across the river to head in to Glasgow as we were heading across the road to go north. We hiked 1.7 miles to Johns Hollow Shelter in the remaining sunlight of the day. It was the last sun we'd be seeing for a while. Spidey, Magellan and Strider were already there.    Thru hikers are sometimes warned not to stay at shelters that are too close to a road because sometimes the locals like to mess with the hikers. Apparently 1.7 miles is too close to the road, because a couple of locals came in to the site at around 10:30PM after we were all in bed for the night, and sat on the table right in front of the shelter. They proceeded to engage in loud conversation and disparaging comments about hikers, while shining their very bright headlamps in to the shelter and having a veritable weed smoke-a-thon. None of us said anything and fortunately they left after about 15 minutes. Live and learn.5/17/16 end mileage 804.3   Left Johns Hollow Shelter in the rain this morning. Basically a long slog in the rain to Brown Mountain Creek Shelter, which was full by the time hiker midnight came because I one wanted to set up tents in the rain. 5/18/16 end mileage 826.7   Another rainy day that started with a 2700 foot, four mile climb of Bald Knob and we were back up to the 3500 to 4000 foot elevation level again for most of the day.

It was six miles long and a 3000 foot elevation gain. Everyone I was with was glad to reach the top of that one! The rest of the day was comparatively easier and the weather got better as the day went on. Our destination was Humpback Mountain and there is a nice tent site near the top with a beautiful view from some ledges about 50 feet away. By the time we got set up it was pretty late so I took my stove out on the ledges and made my supper right there as we watched a beautiful sunset. After everyone else left to go to bed I stayed out there and watched the lights come on in the town below. Oh, and there was a full moon shining as well. 5/20/16 end mileage 861.3   Today was a short day, only 12.3 miles to Rockfish Gap, which is right at the north end of the Blue Ridge Parkway. Our final destination for the day was Waynesboro, VA and a hostel called Stanimals 328 Hostel. It's run by 2004 thru hiker Adam Stanley.    So anyways, we walked out of the woods onto US 250, still without a plan on how we were going to get from the trailhead into Waynesboro, a distance of about four miles. We had been standing there maybe two minutes when a car pulled over and the driver asked us if we wanted a ride to town. About then Jimmy-John comes out of the woods behind us, so the gentleman in the car gave all three of us a ride to town. More trail magic! In a little while someone from the hostel came and picked us all up and took us to the hostel. Stanimal's is in the finished basement of a nice house in a suburban subdivision. From the outside you'd never know it has a hostel in the basement. Very nice, clean placze to stay, with cheap snacks for hikers to buy, a washer and dryer, and a big screen TV in the bunkroom. After we got showered up a big group of us went to the Ming Garden all-you-can-eat Chinese restaurant for dinner. There was Seabiscuit, Food Bag, Caboose, Spiderman, Captain Ahab, Lieutenant Dan, Diesel, Cold Snap , Moondog, Nail Gun and his wife Mary, and myself. It was a great time. I think the restaurant people were probably happy to see us go, though. Thru hikers can eat a lot!5/21/16    We decided that we liked Stanimal's so much that we would take a zero day there. After sleeping in a little later than usual (about 0715) we all got up and got going. We got a ride to the local Wal-mart for a resupply. Later, after getting back to the hostel, Food Bag, Seabiscuit, Caboose, Spiderman, Diesel, Cold Snap and I decided to walk to the movie theater to see the movie Jungle Book. Since we got there pretty late, and the theater was full of little kids, we all had to sit separated from each other. The movie was good, though. After the movie we went back to Stanimal's and watched movies on the big screen TV.","The Priest Shelter

It's a little sad seeing someone you've hiked with for about two months call it quits, but I understand...he's a long way from home.    We were dropped off back at Rockfish Gap and spent the day hiking in the rain. We ended up at Blackrock Hut and fortunately there was still room in the shelter so we didn't have to set up in the rain. We were lucky, because quite a few more hikers came looking for shelter space, but we got the last of it. There is a really nice spring right out in front of this shelter, too. Today we also entered Shenandoah National Park. 5/23/16 end mileage 903.4   We ended at Hightop Hut today. The rain ended partway through the day. We hit the 900 mile mark today. 5/24/16 end mileage 927.3   Hightop Hut to Rock Spring Hut. Weather finally turned sunny today. A bunch of us (Caboose, Food Bag, Spidey, Lieutenant Dan, Captain Ahab and myself) went to the Big Meadows Wayside for lunch today. If you don't know what a Wayside is, it's basically a tourist trap inside SNP, where you can get expensive souvenirs and junk food or eat at a restaurant with highly inflated prices and food that's not that great. But we had heard that the blackberry milkshakes were not to be missed so we had to try it out. Well, the hamburg and french fries were definitely second rate but the shakes were good, although overpriced. Unfortunately, the shakes didn't settle well with some of us!    I finally saw a bear today shortly before getting to the hut for the night. That was kind of exciting, although it wasn't that close, maybe 100 feet away.","Rockfish Gap

It was a welcome night on the town after the rainy weather we had on the 10th. We stayed at a really nice little motel called the Autumn Breeze. The owner actually came up to the trailhead in Franconia Notch and picked us up. After we got settled in at the motel we went to the store next door and got our first supper, some really big deli sandwiches. Then we watched a little TV and after that we were ready for our second dinner at the Truant's Taverne right down the road. I was about done for the night after that but Mismatch, Ginger Patch and Food Bag were ready for ice cream so we stopped at the ice cream place next to the Taverne so thy could get some. Thru hikers eat a lot.    We were up this morning at 0630 and got breakfast at the store, then the lady who owns the motel took us back to the Liberty Spring trailhead so we could begin our ascent to Franconia Ridge. When they say that the thru-hike really begins in the Whites, they're not kidding. The mountains of New Hampshire are kicking my butt! This is making the other states seem relatively easy! First Moosilauke then the Kinsmans and today Little Haystack, Lincoln, Lafayette and Garfield. The sad thing is that I've climbed all of these mountains before so I should have known what was coming. Of course, then I wasn't doing it with a 38 lb. pack on my back, just a daypack. It makes all the difference. Sometimes I think that pack has a vendetta to pull me backwards down a very steep trail. We were very lucky today, though, to get a beautiful day to traverse Franconia Ridge. The views were amazing. The day after tomorrow we'll be over in the Presidentials and I hope we get a couple of days like this one for that part of the hike.    Tonight we're at Garfield Ridge campsite and I think it's going to get a bit cool. Plus I see some clouds rolling in so I hope we stay dry.    My feet are still holding up okay, although I did get another case of shin splints on the 4th of July and I'm still feeling that a little bit. Seems to take forever to go away. I got some new trail runners a few days ago when we were in Hanover NH that are a half size larger than the boots I had and that has made a big difference in the way my feet feel throughout the day.

We had a couple of really steep climbs today. One was South Twin Mountain with a 1500 foot climb over 1.4 miles. Later in the day we had a lot of steep downhill sections which are as difficult as steep uphills, maybe more so. We went to two huts today, Galehead and Zealand. We stopped at Zealand for lunch and a couple of games of cards before pushing on to Ethan Pond Shelter, where we set up our tents on a platform. This is a very popular campsite...before the end of the day the shelter and all of the tent platforms were full. The trail from Zealand Hut to Ethan Pond follows the old roadbed of the Zealand Valley Railroad so it was pretty flat except where there are washouts and rockslides. Zealand Valley RR was built in the late 1800's to haul logs out of the woods. This entire area was clearcut and later all the slash that was left behind caught on fire and the area was pretty well devastated. The amazing restorative power of the forest has taken over though and now you'd never know that the area suffered such bad treatment. The last time I was on this trail was in the late 80's (I think) with my friend Jim when we also stayed at Ethan Pond. I never thought that the next time would be about 30 years later on an AT thru hike. Ethan Pond it's self is a beautiful place. I took some sunset photos tonight and I'll try and choose the best one and post it with this journal entry.","Garfield Ridge Campsite

Mismatch saw a moose in Ethan pond but it was gone by the time the rest of us got down there to see it. After we crossed Route 302 in Crawford Notch we started the day's climbing in earnest. The views from the top of Webster Cliff were amazing! The weather was starting to close in though. The summits of the Willey Range to the west were already in the clouds. We arrived at Mizpah Hut at around lunch time and much to everyone's delight we were given the leftovers from last night's meal, cold pulled pork and some kind of beef and mushrooms (I didn't ask questions, I just ate it). Never pass up free food. We didn't hang around Mizpah too long because the weather forecast was for severe t-storms with hail after 3:00 pm and we had about five miles to go to get to Lakes. The trail increases in elevation all the way to Lakes of the Clouds and it got cooler and cloudier as we went. I finally arrived at the hut at around 3:00pm and I couldn't even see the hut until I was about 75 feet away from it. The good news is that it's now 5:30pm and the thunderstorms have yet to materialize.    All five of us have been offered the work-for-stay option here at the hut which means that in exchange for a couple of hours of work from each of us, we all get to stay in the building tonight and we get to eat the leftovers after dinner. Good deal! I've already washed some dishes and I expect I'll be washing a few more after dinner. In the morning after helping the hut croo with breakfast we'll have a 1.5 mile hike to the summit of Mt. Washington and then 13.5 more miles over the rest of the Presidential Range to Pinkham Notch and a ride to Gorham NH for a night in town.    So, right now we're all sitting here on the sidelines at the hut watching all the paying guests file in to the dining room to be served their dinner. This is not an easy thing for hungry thru hikers to watch. I feel a bit like a vulture waiting to swoop in after dinner to clean up the spoils. More later.    Well, the rains finally came. At about 6:00pm it started pouring with a vengeance and kept it up all through dinner, then at 7:30 it miraculously stopped and the sky started clearing. We swept up the dining room after all the diners were done eating, then we finally were allowed to eat. It was delicious though. Black bean enchiladas with roasted broccoli and rice, corn chowder, salad, challah bread and chocolate cookies for dessert. And all we could eat. After dinner we went outside to witness a beautiful sunset. Now I'm assuming we'll be allowed to set up our beds in the dining room after all the guests go to bed. All in all I'd say it's been a pretty good day. Now I'm hoping for some clear skies in the morning so we can have a good view from Mt. Washington.","Ethan Pond Shelter
