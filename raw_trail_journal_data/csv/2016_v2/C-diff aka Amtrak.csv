C-diff aka Amtrak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552590,"This my first entry. I just registered with the AT Conservancy, set up my trail journal account and ordered AWOL's 2017 AT Trail Guide. I am planning a NOBO hike with my start date 2017.3.17. I will begin this journey at Amicalola Falls, doing the approach trail. I will use the trail name ""C-diff"", my call sign on a military deployment, but expect that may change on the trail.",,"Mt Katadhin, ME","Dec 23, Fri",0
C-diff aka Amtrak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552595,"My latent passion for hiking:I always loved to walk (I now call this urban hiking) but grew up in a large city in Connecticut. Despite growing up in the city, my family frequently car camped, which I also loved. However, I had never been exposed to hiking or backpacking. Growing up in New England, I knew of the Appalachian Trail and that folks ""walked the whole thing over many months"" but that was the extent of my knowledge. After moving to Idaho, I had started hiking, but as a ""flat lander"" I did not understand basic mountain/desert concepts such as altitude changes to include rapid temperature changes, unpredictable mountain storms, planning to hike/summit early in the day, as well as desert temperature changes, exposure to the sun without cover, proper gear, etc. This resulted in a few trying experiences. In 2012 I joined a couple of local hiking clubs. These seasoned and local hikers taught me about the above concepts and I quickly developed a passion for hiking. It wasn't long before I began to backpack with my hiking friends and realized this combined my love of walking/hiking and camping! Discussions of long distance hikes such as the John Muir trail, the AT and the PCT, began to come up frequently in the hiking group's conversations. The idea of completing AT section hikes became more and more intriguing, but the time commitment was not compatible with my employment and I loved my current job. However, I could not get the idea out of my head and thought about it whenever I hiked, which was frequently and eventually even when I was not hiking. Sometime in late 2015/early 2016, I decided to retire and my desire to complete the AT in section hikes developed to actually planing a thru-hike! What a life-changing 4 years!",,"Mt Katadhin, ME","Dec 23, Fri",0
C-diff aka Amtrak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552596,"I started backpacking with borrowed gear. Looking back, nothing really fit me or my habits, but through the soreness and fatigue, I still realized I had discovered an activity I was passionate about and wanted to pursue further. Belonging to a hiking/backpacking group was invaluable. My first trip included about 35 of us! Everyone was proud of and eager to brag about their gear. This trip was like going to a gear show in the field and I learned so much that weekend. I had never seen a backpacking stove before and watched folks boil water and cook food on everything from alcohol stoves to Jetboil's. Having been in the military, I had eaten my share of MRE's but had never seen all of the commercial and homemade dehydrated meals that were only limited by someone's imagination and ingenuity. I quickly learned you never discussed a piece of gear without providing the listeners with the item's weight. From tents to backpacks to sleeping systems to clothing, it was apparent, to be a backpacker, you had to be obsessed with weight. At first this intrigued me, but it did not take me long to embrace this phenomenon. Yes, I too now have a mini scale on the shelf with my backpacking gear. Once I started to acquire my own gear, I soon realized the challenge included finding an item which was the right fit for me as well as balancing the weight of an item with the amount of money I was willing to spend on it. This can be a long and tedious process, but I also liked the challenge it offered. Of course, ""I have to get out and trial my new ..."" was always a great excuse to plan an backpacking weekend!",,"Mt Katadhin, ME","Dec 23, Fri",0
C-diff aka Amtrak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553569,"Well, it's time to start making my way to the East Coast! I will leave Idaho this coming week and drive to the east coast. During February and early March, I will spend time with my folks in Connecticut, complete some shakedown hikes/backpacks with my gear and finalize my travel plans to GA in mid-March. 55 days until Amicacola Falls - the approach trail!","

C-diff aka Amtrak,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555866,"Making my final plans to get to GA! 
Been in Connecticut since 1/30/17, visiting my folks, hiking/backpacking and shaking down my pack. I was able to section hike/backpack 60 plus miles in NY and CT in snow, freezing temps, wind and even a rare 70 degree day! I was able to use the shelters and privy's - something I had not done before. Great prep for what is ahead. Most importantly, I feel confident with my current pack/clothing choices. Hiking in the arid hi-deserts and mountains of Idaho are much different then the wet forests of Connecticut.
My plans for the next couple of days consists of visiting friends/family and tying up last minute business one needs to do when putting your life on hold for 6 months. This can be a daunting task. However, I've been through this multiple times in the past when prepping for military deployments.
Many aspects of the preparation of this trip have paralleled prepping for a military deployment: 
Packing - making choices regarding ""the right"" gear.
Getting housekeeping items in order - closing up your home, hiring folks to take care of the lawn, making sure bills, insurance, auto registrations that will come due while you are gone are all addressed, etc)
Emotional - realizing you will miss those special folks in your life. Of course, never in history has communication been easier, but there is more to relationships than just phone calls. I already miss my Idaho friends and hiking buddies whom I have not seen in 6 weeks. It has been strange wandering around in the woods without them!
At church 3 days ago, I became overwhelmed with the feeling, ""the time has come."" Since then, I've been jumping out of my skin, eager to begin this journey I've planned for so long! Conversely, I have begun to miss my ""Connecticut connections"" to include my parents and a local hiking buddy who helped me complete much of my NY/CT section hikes.
On Tuesday, March 14, I will begin to make my way south via a local train to NYC, than Amtrak to Atlanta, GA (long distance travel by train, another bucket-list item.)
After arriving in Atlanta on the 15th, I have about 48 hours before I start up the 604 steps at Amicalola Falls (yes I am going to start with the approach trail to Springer Mt.) I am still working on a plan of how I will spend those 48 hours besides sleeping after 24 hours on a train. I am contemplating driving up to the GA and NC state high-points. It would meant bagging State #24 and #25 of my 50 State hi-point bucket-list!
The pics were taken during my NY/CT sections hikes over the past 5 weeks...",,Katadin,"Mar 08, Wed",0
