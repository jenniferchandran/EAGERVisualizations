Ghost Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518686,"Well I have been preparing and scraping enough funds together for my AT adventure that will start on the 1st of March, 2016. I've been hiking as much as I can though this is Nebraska and frankly, the terrain does not lend much to the interest of a 20 mile trek. Most of my gear is purchased but still have some smalls to put together such as first aid kit and cooking supplements.My wife and I have been doing a lot of experimenting with dehydrated foods and I feel pretty comfortable with the idea of hiking stoveless. On my hikes around here I've tested re-hydrating of my foods and so far everything has been very palatable, especially since we usually really spice our dishes up anyway.To be completely honest, as I get closer to the start date and this whole process becomes more and more real it also gets more scary but I guess that's part of this whole process I'm looking for. To get myself out of the mundane everyday existence and continue testing myself while I still have my wits about me and physical ability to do so.",,View Entry,"Dec 23, Wed",0
Ghost Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518830,"I worried and worried about whether or not my clothing would be warm enough for starting my hike in early March. I finally had to simplify things in my mind and remember when I was younger and would hike in wicked snow storms with gear that by today's standards was pretty worthless, and I survived. I've been cold before, and we tend to get too wrapped up in our comfort habits. Hiking and camping when the weather is convenient instead of being willing to accept the challenge of an inconvenient adventure.
Anyway, I've been testing my clothing and for the most part am very pleased with what I've selected. My last hike though was windy and 28F and though I didn't exactly suffer I am wondering if I should have a mid layer shirt instead of the zip up UnderArmour jacket that I wore under the fleece jacket.",,home,"Dec 29, Tue",0
Ghost Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518953,"It is certainly difficult to find good days this time of the season in Nebraska to get out and hike. Was planning on a good 15 miler but after 4 near misses on falling I decided to pull back and be satisfied with a 10 miler. Tomorrow will be cold and windy, ugh!I have been working on organizing my mail drops today and experimenting with a couple more dehydrated ideas for trail meals. This whole 'hummus' thing is a new found treasure for tasty meals and it dehydrates down to a powder that takes up virtually no space and very lightweight.",,View Entry,"Jan 02, Sat",0
Ghost Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519785,It's getting tough to keep up with much hiking since the temps have dropped off but still plugging away with what I can. Went out today without my pack and did the slip and slide for a few miles... ugh! Earned my 'Japan' badge today with my FitBit after hiking over 1869 miles since last april as I try to get ready for the big trail.Hard to believe it's only a month and a half till I start and now the nerves are really kicking in.Ghost Walker,,walk-about,"Jan 17, Sun",0
Ghost Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521130,"The last couple weeks have been in full food production mode for Theresa and I. My hope is to have a reasonable inventory of dehydrated meals so that Theresa can take a break from this madness. Today we made a huge batch of our copy of Zara rains red bean and rice and now have 30 cups on the dehydrator. Other foods we have done are avocado hummus and a. Basic chickpea hummus. Also we have created a couple of chili's with lots of spices and hot peppers. A couple of lentil meals with black or red beans. Can't leave out the homemade oatmeal that is just awesome. I've tested each meal with using cold water to rehydrate which works if but a bit slower but the decision to go stove less is still very doable.I also am very happy about the fact that it might be easier than I thought to keep the vegan diet though I'm sure I might have to cheat occasionally if short on food.I Am working on my mail food drop itinerary and will plan on 5 or 6 days of meals about every 120 miles with minor Resupply especially at towns along the way between drops.Hard to believe it is two weeks to go till the start of this adventure but as they say, 'The hills are calling.'",,none,"Feb 13, Sat",0

Ghost Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522380,Well Tuesday morning started from Omaha and tried to fly to Atlanta. got as far as O'Hare Airport in Chicago and then all the flights started shutting down. I think I had 5 delays and two cancellations when i finally found out I was going to have to sleep in the airport. Not a real fun experience but I got me some lessons on patience as I SAT there and watched the man walking down the concourse all red in the face and talking and cursing to himself I thought is no reason for me to get that upset about something that is out of my control.So made it here to a friend's house where MI decided to spend the night. Or was it the freezing cold Atlanta winter? (26 degrees)Tomorrow will be driving to trailhead with my friend and will start the hike finally.,,"atlanta, georgia","Mar 02, Wed",0

I ended up basically sleeping under the stars with a rain jacket over my face and no under quilt to keep my back warm. Amazingly I woke not feeling cold and it was 22 degrees. So rabbit and I started before ash and Dan so rhat we could walk the 3 mountains slow to survive the day and finished with the gruesome blood mountain. A truly tortuous beast.

The hills were gruesome.... or I was totally exhausted but it's down in the valley and 30 or so hikers are spread about the surrounding hills.

Started slow, went up the hills slow, went down slow but must been faster than I thought because got to blue Mt shelter at miles bh noon.
Now, to stay here at the top of a Mt ( old,windy) or hike down and hope to find camp sites. 6 of us oldies decided we needed to shake things up and try to force more food down.

So far my hips have been the limiting factor with where we have camping but feeling good. The nights have been warm and no rain so far. Really foggy this morn and humid so was glad I was able to drink way more than usual, probably at least a gallon and would drink more but don't want to walk down 300 feet for more till tomorrow morn.
Just before this campsite we crossed over to north Carolina and gotta say, Georgia was tough. In 3 days will take a zero day to recover and stuff some calories down.

Even the 4 mile uphill was nice and for first time didn't have to go in oxygen depletion. Started at 7:00 and thought old fox and three jack would catch up but walked 16 miles by myself and landed at long branch with nobody there though others showed up later.Stayed in the shelter because of impending rain and woke to lots of rain and scampering of little mouse feet.Views on Albert watch tower were awesome with miles of forest all around, worth the scramble but there are those amongst us who would dare complain os the difficulty.

So much for hiking my own hike because got here at this shelter and I'm by myself.It was a good 14.4 mile day.There is a 70 year old hiking this year that goes by tinker. He averages 12 miles each day, sometimes pulls into camp after dark and eats then sleeps wherever he can find. So a couple nights ago there was rain on the way and tinker was leaving camp an hour before dark and we tried to talk him out of it. The next day in the pouring rain as some climbers were scrambling hand and foot up Albert mountain they came across tinker tucked under a rock overhang sleeping in the only dry spot around. He yawned, zipped up his jacket and told the hikers that he needed a full bag of peanuts and headed out. Quite the guy and turning into quite a legend.","rock gap

When I got to the bottom at the shelter my knees were just throbbing. I kept looking at my altimeter app hoping I was close.I've done 32 miles in the last 2 days and actually left my bubble and caught the bubble of hikers that started 2 days before me.

There are occasions when local people or past hikers will show up at road crossings with food and drinks and even with grills to make burgers and dogs. Well I have been amazingly unlucky at catching any of this trail magic but yesterday I showed up at the Nantahala outdoor center and went to the restaurant for breakfast. There was a person ahead of me with a nasty slogan on her hat which didn't leave a good impression but when I finished eating and asked for the check I was told that she had paid my and 5 others bill.Tonight we are camped at the last shelter before the smoky national park, warm out and clear so should be nice. My meal was a garlic hummus that was reconstituted with cold water and spread on tortilla shell.

Needless to say most are zeroing tomorrow and when we showed up at the restaurant for dinner it was really interesting to see the hugs and excitement at meeting up with hikers that were separated for only a few days. And this is by people who have only hiked for a couple weeks.One piece of awesome news was the big Nora virus scare. A rumor that blew up and had everybody scared about staying at the shelters. Well it all Ryu red out to be only 1 person and the shelter he was rescued from was disinfected.There is absolutely no feeling like showering off a week of sweat and dirt and stink and all the salt stained clothes getting washed. Once things warm up I'm sure I will be much more stingy with zero days and will have to more cleaning on the trail. Right now though my legs are really getting tired and need a recharge.

Different story as we climbed 3000 feet and temps dropped and wind picked up and we were soaked from the effort. But we made it to the shelter to get a spot and the unlucky ones were over 20 in number of tents outside in the frigid 23 degrees. We were lucky where it was at least 25.Interesting tidbit that I read sometime ago in that there are always those who are so unused to the cold that they are the ones who will walk a half mile to collect firewood for a fire, which does very little good but it's nice that they are willing to do that for us others who just want to wrap up with our bags and listen to the talk of the trail.

Ghost Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524741,The saga of the snow continues. Cold and very windy especially on the north side of hills so had to keep well covered but also means getting soaked from sweat. Stopped at a shelter to rest with 5 miles to go and when we started again I could sense some very real signs of hypothermia. Confusion and stumbling and horrid shivering. All that started leading to dehydration so I had to really buckle down and start drinking extra every time we found a water source. Also had to force feed myself energy bars and trail mix for calories. Arrived at Derrick know shelter soaked amidst windy conditions and here my saving grace in that I keep a dedicated pair of dry camp socks and long underwear. Also stripped off wet shirts and put on down jacket and fleece jacket then wrapped my wet hair in a wool hiking scarf.

Ghost Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524746,"The rules of shelter use in the smokies are very biased against thru hikers. In the smokies a thru hiker can hike hard and fast to make it to a shelter before it fills and a day or short section hiker that has reserved a spot beforehand can show up, late, as the sun is going down and demand the last hiker to show up leave and set up their tent in the dark. We had that happen and it just so happened the last thru hiker believed he could demand that he didn't have to leave because he doesn't carry a tent so couldn't sleep elsewhwere. What a mess but you meet all kinds on the trail.The hiking today was even slushier with 2 steps forward and 1 step back. Talking to others tonight everyone admitted to multiple falls myself included. My last was in camp while barefoot in my soaked freezing shoes and I slipped and landed on my back in the mud, ugh!The shelter is .5 miles off trail and to top it off the water source was labeled as .1 miles but was at least half mile and dow n steep icy slope. The pines around the shelter made for a cozy setting.Went up cling man's dome which is the highest point on the AT and the views were awesome and the climb was actually quite easy though 6 miles of climbing in mud took its toll.","Derrick know shelter

It took long enough to get in town that there was no way I could get back on the mountain and hike the 5 miles to the next shelter.

Slowly it is becoming a bit easier, both because of gaining what people call trail legs and the terrain is changing. One thing that has not gotten easier is what we endured last night. One hiker with a thermometer said the temp had bottomed out at 20 degrees so it had to be in the mid teens. All our water froze and luckily I kept my filter in my pocket or it would be useless. The wind howled all night and I had every bit of clothing on and the down jacket and fleece and rain jacket but shivered all night. I wasn't alone in that.
When we woke we hurried to pack and hit the trail running. I did the first 3 miles in 1 hour just to get off the ridge and down in elevation, (we were at 5500 feet.) The rule of thumb is add 5 degrees for every 1000 feet down.
I am still relatively pain free but in bad need of a zero day to eat and recuperate so hiked 17 miles down to erwin, TN and got a room with co-hiker dusty at uncle Johnny hostel and tomorrow will pick up my mail drop of food for next section.

We had 3 big mountains and with the cool day it was good hiking. Haven't had reception for 3 days so this entry is after the fact.I was going to write about the art of hammocking. My hammock is a bottom entry which then secures together with velcro. When it's cold you have to have either a under quilt or a pad to put in the hammock to lay on. My under quilt is rated at 15 degrees and works by keeping the air from moving under you and giving you cold butt syndrome. The quilt is 3 quarter length so if it's real cold I have to put my sit pad under my feet. My sleeping quilt has a toe box that fully encloses my feet and the rest of the quilt drapes over the top and you could tuck the edges around you. Though the top quilt is rated for 30 I've kept warm down to 15. Most hammocks are tied with a special knot to tree straps but I modified mine with Whoopi slings that I can quickly adjust tension and in the morning when my fingers are froze I just unhook and pack up the hammock.

Johnny rocket hikes till he feels like a nap then lays down on the trail with his jacket over his face and sleeps for an hour or so. All the hikers have to step over him and eventually someone wakes him and he continues. Anyway, a day of rocks and small hills did me in. When I passed the high point of New Jersey and got to the 13 mile shelter I knew it was the end today.Had a big rain after I put up my hammock but I kept dry in the shelter and now it's cool and beautiful out while I lay in the hammock and listen to the birds and probably tonight also listen to the bears trying to get to our food bags locked in the bear proof boxes.","Gen Anderson shelter

Some days it's hard to just keep putting one foot in front of the other never mind the fact that you can't daydream or hike head down for long and have to keep track of the white blazes on the trees or rocks. Unfortunately in NY the white blazing is horrible and sometimes your left scratching your head. The toughest sometimes is getting to an intersection of trails or coming out of the woods on a road and you would think straight ahead but not always the case and no matter how hard you look there is nothing until you try one way or the other. I did that and thought I saw a white blaze but after over a half mile realized I went the wrong way. That was only one of probably 4 or 5 times. Rock acrambles are also tough and in NY there are so few blazes and you can't see a worn trail over rocks so who wants to climb rock scrambles only to find you didn't have to.Pulled into the shelter with 19 miles by 2:30 and promptly ordered a pizza. This is called a pizza shelter where local shops will deliver to the road nearby. The wind picked up and temp dropped and soon everyone had warm gear on but a good night for sleeping.

Today I did 14 miles and my calf held up fairly good. My calculations still show I only need 12.5 miles per day to finish on the 10 th.,"somewhere

The profile did not show the roots, mud, rocks, and a thousand small ups. Had a good night sleep though and ate a good fish chowder and did a minor Resupply in town for food.","Frye notch

Ghost Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543316,"We nobo's are definitely meeting the main bubble of South bounds now. Probably crossed paths with 15 or so hikers and stayed at this shelter with all sobos. You can really see the lack of experience in these hikers with only a couple hundred miles compared with my fellow nobo's. I can watch them and probably pick the individuals that will never make the distance starting with the young kids all strung out on drugs and thinking this is a big party. One thing that really pissed me off is the school teacher who thinks these kids that are high and drunk are just so cute and precious.The shelter I am staying at is the last place that inch worm was seen alive at 2 years ago. She was an older lady hiker that got lost and was finally found 2 years later after having succumbed to the elements. It is quite evident that the section of trail in Maine had gotten just a bit, or much too much wild and overgrown and unmarked because there has been a lot of recent work and the white blazes on trees are all new and numerous.","hiker hut hostel

Ghost Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543650,Did a big day today even if I promised myself that I wouldnt. I wanted to give myself some cushion at Katadyn for figuring out how to get to the Bangor airport. I'm set up for doing the Bigelow tomorrow and getting excited to finish these mountains finally. The view from the shelter is the best yet and we look up to the peak of Mount avery. We can even see the sobos hikers up there. I've been continuing to switch my knee brace back and forth and it really helps to take the strain off going down the hills. Still being careful with not straining my calf on the right leg but it's just tired over the edge I think. Going to go to bed early and get up earlier to put in another big day.,"Crocker campsite

Ghost Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543662,"I've been taking pictures for the last 2 days of the 4 signs saying we've gone over 2000 miles. The most accurate sign is the sign on the trail made from sticks and will probably be respected enough to not be messed with all summer. Got on the trail at 4:45 am and had 3 big peaks and 3 smaller and the views were phonominal from the tops of the bigalows. When I got to the top of the first and could see down to the shelter I screamed loudly just to see if anyone 1500 feet down would waken, yeah, I'm kinda crazy sometimes. The air high up was cool but coming down into the valley it was hot and the day turned out to be quite tough. I wanted to do a big day so that Monday I could reach the ferry crossing the Kennebec river before it closes at 2pm.Actually had a grumpy hiker at the shelter tell me that nobody who gets up at 4:30 should stay in the shelter so I invited him to get up with me and finally asked him to leave my shelter. A really odd attitude concerning his take on the trail community.","horns pond lean to's

Ghost Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543968,"The trail today was just wonderful. Flat, soft, and even the mountain was easier than normal so I got on the trail at 5:15 and opened it up to do the 14 miles and make it to the Kennebec river and catch the ferry to the carat unknown side. Had no worries about making it and did the 14 by 10 o'clock. An awesome day. The carat unknown B&B where I stayed was beautiful and super clean. A truly wonderful experience. I did some supplementing with food to make it through the 100 mile wilderness where there is no food to be had, at least affordable that is.thos will be my last zero probably and I'll be still a day ahead of schedule so I will have to figure where to slow down. I would rather not slow in the wilderness because of food issues but we will see.I think I've managed to slow the weight loss but I'm sure my body is starting to consume my leg muscles now because even the small hills are killing me and talking to all the other guys they are experiencing the same. The women on the other hand rarely lose much if any weight and continue to get stronger as their natural fat reserves are transformed to muscle.","West carry pond lean to

Gotta eat down the heavy items or I'll collapse. I wore my knee brace, turned around and covering my calf muscle and keeping it warm seemed to really help. I was so tired that I almost didn't setup my hammock but the bugs convinced me otherwise. As warm as it was during the night I find that I still need my under quilt or my back gets cold with the air underneath the hammock.A couple of others that I hiked with 800 miles ago caught up to me so it was a nice reunion.

Ghost Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545001,"With no phone signal in the 100 mile wilderness I have not entered anything for over a week so I will make a few wrap up entries.
I stopped in Monson to get more food because even though I thought I would have enough I can't stop eating and in two days ate a quarter of my food already. Entered the 100 mile wilderness on leaving Monson where there are supposed to be no chance of Resupply in but right away we can see that there is no really sense of the word 'wilderness' here. All the roads we cross are privately owned but you can arrange for shuttles or food drops for a big fee. Also we see day hikers in droves every day. Every day we pass more people than any part of the trail. Most of the southbound hikers are past us and those we see and with so few miles on them really have that scared look, just like us when we were in Georgia. 
Of course we have learned that the hills never end and we had some challenging days. All the thru hikers are experiencing a lot of exhaustion so even the small mountains are killing our legs but we keep chugging. The weather is the warmest we've seen on the trail so that is causing mice and chipmunks to really be active and we desperately protect our dwindling food but to no avail and I lose energy bars or candy bars nightly.
About halfway thru the wilderness we started seeing mt. Katahdin for the first time and when on whitecap mountain really saw how imposing that finish really was. Spent a lot of time in the mornings when I was the only hiker on the trail picking blueberries and fully intended on collecting them to eat later but that always turned into throwing handfuls of berries in my mouth.
The wilderness trails were really intermixed with horrible roots and rocks and then sections of trail that felt like a carpet. I was really trying to slow down but a couple days where the trail was flat and in my eagerness would do big miles which was undoing in the end with being 3 days ahead of schedule.","pleasant pond shelter

Ghost Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545208,"These last days of the 100 mile wilderness were spent more as a stroll. I averaged around 10-12 miles and stopped at a lot of the ponds to rest and relax. even though i was doing so few miles I still felt that need to get out of the hammock early and still started on the trail each morning by 5:00 and would get to the next campsite around 12:00.It's amazing how beautiful this part of Maine is with the forests of pine and little undergrowth, the ponds and streams but there sure is little wildlife around it seems. Maybe the chipmunks scare all the other animals away because we sure saw some very aggressive squirrels and chipmunks. They would jump on our packs as soon as we set them on the ground and within seconds would chew through the backpack. It was getting tough to wake up to the birds since there are so few birds but the 6 hour internal alarm clock still works. if to sleep by 9 I still wake by 3 and lay around till 4:30.As far as the streams go there was still some tough spots where we would pass many places marked on the guide book as having water only to find a mud puddle or damp soil so I started carrying 2 liters all the time. As weary as I got to feeling, the last couple of mountains were still quite tame though those last South bounders told us how awful those hills were. All the while we catch views of Katahdin getting closer and more imposing.finally exited the wilderness at Abol Bridge and stopped at the store/restaurant and again met Jason who i've seen over the last 5 days. After eating we set up camp next to the river and had one last fight with chipmunks stealing food and chewing my bags during the night. At one point I grabbed my food bag down from the tree and slept with it figuring that bears were the least of my worries since the squirrels will surely scare the bears away.next day hiked the last 10 miles into Baxter state park and camped with 5 other thru-hikers for the night in anticipation of the summit on the Sunday.","Abol bridge

Ghost Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545211,"woke up at 3:30 and on the trail by 4:00 in the dark so the first couple miles I had to use my headlamp. I was so excited to be this near the end that I melted those 4500 feet of climbing away but then I suppose the fact that I took all my heavy stuff out of my pack really helped too and I have to admit it felt good not carrying 30 pounds for a change. I did carry 2 liters of water though and glad I did. It soon became cold enough to have to put on my fleece jacket and wool hat and gloves. When I got above tree line the wind was howling and the fog soaked me pretty quickly. This mountain had some pretty good false peaks and when the steep climbing was over there is still the 1.5 miles of table lands to hike until the real summit.It was so amazing to reach that sign and about 500 yards before the fog lifted and the wind started to abate to make for the best summit I could have imagined. It really was quite an emotional time to realize that finally, after 2189.1 miles I succeeded in this beast of an adventure that to be honest, really wondered if I could. Nahhhh! I knew that I would make it if I had to crawl to the finish but the feeling of joy at the accomplishment was wonderful. To make the ending even more sweet was that so many of the friends that I hiked with for hundreds if not a thousand or more miles had caught up and decided to summit the same day as me so as I descended I was able to say my good byes to so many. I literally flew down that 4500 feet of mountain and rested at the bottom while waiting for my ride to come down from his summit. Wow, talk about feeling lost suddenly when the goal has been reached and now what?I truly believe that it was not the miles or the monster mountains I climbed or the pain I endured and conquered over but the friends that became like family to me on the trail. Age and cultural differences, background with experiences or employment, none of that mattered when we all had a common bond with the trail. the time after the miles and when we pulled into shelters or met up in groups at stealth sites next to rivers and we talked about our day on the trail. Those are the times I will remember the most and relish the memories of how we came together to hike this thing called the AT.","Abol bridge
