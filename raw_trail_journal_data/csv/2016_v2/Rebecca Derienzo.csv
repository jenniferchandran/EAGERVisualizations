Rebecca Derienzo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525719,"We started 930 on Wednesday morning.Thank you mama and papa Monaco for driving us to Georgia. We hiked the 604 steps easily lol - with plenty of breaks to enjoy the falls and mountain scenery.We met our first person on the trail. His trail name is Hopeful. He tells us of his multiple thru hikes and we hope we are successful as him. Although he did say that 138 of 160 days on the trail he had rain. But his wisdom and encouragement empower us to keep going. The sun is shining today and we are two very happy hikers.9 miles later we are at the top of Springer mountain the southern terminas of the AT. Quite a few people at the top who we have been traveling with all the way to Hiawassee.We stayed at the Springer mtn shelter in our tent. Our first night in the ""wilderness"" went perfectly. An amazing sunset over our first views of the Georgia skyline. My hope is that every night could be so epic but we know that will not be possible. We will take the amazing sunset moments and remember them.A few days later we do experience rain and we love that weather as well. The ups, the downs, the sun, the rain - life is good on the trail.","Amicalola State Park

Rebecca Derienzo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525713,"Huge thunderstorm rolled in today. We hiked up and over Blood Mountain in a thick fog. No views from the top but the terrain was technical and we hit 1847 ft of climbing.Paul did 11 pushups on the top of Blood Mountain today. He is working on the upper body to keep up with the lower body work out. We get to Neels Gap at about 1pm after walking through rain all morning. We get to Mountain Crossing outfitters and it is crowded - the hostel is almost sold out and the nearby cabins are sold out. We walk over to Blood Mountain cabins to see availability. Two ladies were standing outside trying to get in so we started talking. They invited us to share their cabin since everything was sold out. We stayed in a wonderful cabin called Fox - with a loft that we stayed in, while the two ladies stayed on the first floor. Amy (aka Bunkie) and Kerry were the perfect cabin mates. The owner of the cabins - Mark- lived in Maine and Houston before being burnt out from work, he amd his family bought the cabins. Cool dude. We didn't get on the trail until 10ish because we were bs'ing with the owner for a while.","Lance Creek

Rebecca Derienzo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525690,"We are day 9 on the trail and decided to spend the night in town. A large part of staying the night in town was the thunderstorm rolling in. We took a shuttle from Dicks Creek Gap to the Budget Inn but decided to stay at the Holiday Inn Express. For reasons we wish to forget we will not explain why. A bottle of red wine from the Horse Creek Winery was the perfect end to this low mileage day. Rebecca's knee was hurting on the down hills so a much needed warm room and comfy bed was appreciated. ALSO, devouring the moonshine burger and cheese fries from Hardees helped the recovery as well.Looking forward to resupplying at Ingles before heading back out to the trails tommorrw.","
