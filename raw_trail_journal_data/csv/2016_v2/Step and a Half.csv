Step and a Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516079,I am a special education teacher that will be retiring at the end of April and starting my thu hike April 24. I haven't done any serious hiking since my teens when I had the wonderful opportunity to hike with my friend Steve in Colorado. Being from New York this experience was fantastic and I promised myself I would do it again. While I have done some small hikes I haven't done any serious hiking and will finally have the chance to complete a six month adventure in the wilderness. I am looking forward to this and thoughts of the trail and preparation have consumed me.,,Northbound,"Oct 20, Tue",0
Step and a Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516198,"I thought I would write down a couple of reasons of why I want to hike the trail.    I like what I have read about the culture of the A.T, the trail angels, and the faith in humanity that it has renewed in me. I want to become a part of this culture    I want to be challenged by new surroundings, test my resolve to overcome pain, learn new things abut nature, and share those experiences with others. I also will not have to listen to all those presidential election adds that will be running non-stop all summer.",,View Entry,"Oct 23, Fri",0
Step and a Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517264,"From November 1-6 I attended the Appalachian Trail Institute taught by Warren Doyle. I think I learned more from the wonderful people I met than Warren but I highly recommend this course. Warren is an interesting character. He certainly has a passion for the trail and is very knowledgeable about all aspects of successfully completing it. He is also a bit of a preacher and often goes off topic in order to preach his point of view to his students. He doesn't filter water, pay for lodging,use a tent, or cook on the trail. I will do all of these. Still deciding on gear and doing endless planning that will change many times before I take my first step.",,Mountain City Tennessee ,"Nov 13, Fri",0
Step and a Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517457,"   I spent this Saturday at Letchworth State Park hiking what they classified as moderate difficulty. I hiked about 5 miles and it kicked my butt. It was enjoyable and I saw my first snow fall of the season, 11 deer-two at the first sighting and nine at the next, a woodchuck, a downy woodpecker, and numerous squirrels. The Genesee River's roar became hypnotic as I hiked and each step I took I felt I was becoming more and more in time with its flow. I also met a hiker from Buffalo! I thought I was the only one in this city.     On Sunday I decided that I would start walking to work instead of bicycling or driving. This will add 6.6 miles to my training schedule and I wanted to walk it on Sunday with a full pack to see how long it would take me.    On November 4, 2013 I was hit by a car while I was riding my bike to work. As I was walking by the intersection where this happened I got a flashback and pictured myself lying in the road face up in terrible pain. I had broken 3 vertebrae in my back, injured my knee, and bruised my ankle. I remembered how I tried to get up and the pain forcing me back down. That began a long ordeal that would keep me out of work for 10 months. I couldn't ride my bike I really couldn't do anything very physical and I began feeling sorry for myself. Mostly I sat on the couch and ate and drank too much.     As I stopped for a moment with a 20-25 lb. pack on my back and looking down at the road at the spot where I was two years and two weeks ago I began to smile. I had made it through not the most, but one of the most, difficult periods in my life. I knew right then that I will complete a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail. I will pass that spot twice a day many times in the next 6 months and it will not be a place of sadness for me. It will be a place of inspiration. One of the many gifts I know I shall receive from the AT.   ",,View Entry,"Nov 16, Mon",0

I will be hiking for six days with Earl Gray. She is an experienced hiker, fellow ATI attendee, and all around great person. I am fortunate that she has agreed to start my hike with me. My goal from now till February is to continue to lose weight and get my legs in shape so I am not constantly slowing her down. From March 19-26 I plan on picking up the trail wherever I stopped and hopefully make it to Fontana Dam NC. I will then resume my hike around April 24 at Harpers Feryy and hike to Maine, fly to Atlanta then hike to Harpers Ferry. At least this is what it looks like on paper. We shall see.    I hiked 12 miles in Hunters Creek Park Sunday. This park is about 40 minutes from Buffalo and this was my first time there. I was hiking with Spencer, a golden doodle, and we both had a great time. We both came back very muddy. We met a women named Sally who was hiking with a boarder collie and she provided me with some history of the trail and some ideas about where to hike. For the most part I hiked alone all day and despite the parking lot being half full with cars I felt that I had the park all to myself. I plan on going back after Thanksgiving.    Testing out a new pair of boots-- a pair of Keens which are wider in the foot box.",,View Entry,"Nov 23, Mon",0

It was worth it just to be on trail and there were several lessons learned before I start my flip/flop at Harpers Ferry in four weeks on April 24. The trail this first day was difficult for me as I developed back pain that I haven't experienced in any of my practice hikes. 11 miles was too far for me the first day out of the box however I wanted to stay at the Big Walker motel in order to properly rest my aches and pains and regroup.

There was one bright spot however. I was hiking over large boulders most of the day but then I came to a large meadow it was beautiful and reminded me of Julie Andrews singing in the field in the Sound Of Music. My feet just loved being away from the rocks. Didn't last long though and soon it was back to rocks. I made a lot of rookie mistakes today and it cost me dearly. The biggest one was I decided to try and hike commando because I was having some minor issues with my comprehension shorts. I now have cherry red sores on both of my legs and I am living up to my trail name. I once again missed my shelter turn off and easily hiked another two miles that I didn't have to. I also failed to read about where the water source was. It was half a mile down a steep hill. If I had just read about this I would have carried an extra liter of water and would not have to hike this after limping through the last 15 miles.

I wanted to get to the next shelter early so I could get a good tent spot because I will be taking a zero. About two miles down the trail I couldn't see where to go. I sat down on a rock and took a nap until the sun came up. If it wasn't for the pain on my inner thighs this day wouldn't have been bad as far as trai goes. I did make another dumb mistake. The trail came onto a road that had a small pull over and behind it was a small road. I took it for about a quarter of a mile before I realized I had done it again. When I got back to the road there was a car there and the driver watched as I limped passed him. He asked me if I was alright and if I needed a ride. Part of me wanted to say yes but I said no thanks and continued up the trail. I will be here an extra day to heal. Thnk God for Desitin. Thanks for all the messages of encouragement I really enjoy reading them and when I get to a town I will return them. I am saving my phone for navigation.

I can't be sure but I think my grandfather knew I was having trouble. I used to sit next to him at his right at the dinning room table as he read the Troy Record. I don't remember how it got into my hands but I had this book called The Call of the Wild by Jack London. I would pretend to read it as he read the paper. One day he asked me how the book was and I told him I was having trouble with some of the words. I don't remember much from those years but I do remember this. He said, ""Don't worry you will learn and maybe someday you will be Abe to teach other people how to read. Why I have remembered this I do not know. About 10 years ago I saw a student reading The Call of the Wild and realized I have never read the book. I remembered his words and knew I had to read the book. I decided I would read it when I retired as a sort of homage to him and a reward to myself. Today I read the Call of the Wild and think of my grandfather.

Step and a Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531660,"Today was a monster of a day. Rain greeted me good morning as I started my hike. Rain continued to speak to me as the morning progressed.The rain started yelling at me by the afternoon. As I continued to hike on the rain said, ""What do you think of me now you stupid sob."" Every part of me was soaking wet despite having a rain suit. Then the rain stopped, I can't remember when it stopped it just stopped.My pants were soaking wet so I took them off and hiked in my underwear.I felt good as the temperature increased and I began to sweat. With the exception of the pain in my feet (which I no longer consider pain it is now a companion)I felt energized. For the first time in three days the sun made a ephemeral appearance.Around 3:30 Bean Dip and Mama Bean stopped beside a roaring brook to have second lunch. They are from Australia and when I asked them if they kept a journal they told be not really because they realized it was boring. There are no squirrels in Australia so all they were writing was ""I saw a squirrel today, today I saw two squirrels, I can't believe it a squirrel ran right in front of me today."" My goal for the day was the Darlington Shelter and I reached it by 4:00. I didn't feel like stopping so I decided I would just hike until I got tired and just stealth camp somewhere along the trail. I felt good, I felt strong. about two hours latter- not so much.The first thing I noticed was my legs giving out. My shoulders were also burning from the weight of my pack.I needed to stop but there wasn't anything but rocks and no place to pitch a tent. I knew there was a gas line about a half a mile ahead which means the terrain would be cleared. I thought this would be my home for the night. As I was hiking there I started to realize my body was changing. I was sweating profusely however my arms and legs were cold. I have had hypothermia before and I know the warning signs. Now I am getting worried. I reach the gas line which has a beautiful view to the east but I was so tired and flustered I forgot to take a picture. As I look around for a place to pitch my tent I realized to two things; 1. I have stopped hiking so now my body is getting colder and I am shivering. 2.I am at the top of a mountain ridge and exposed to a stiff wind. I can't stop here I must make it to the next shelter to get out of the wind and the rain that is predicted during the night. The shelter is 2.6 miles away and it is now 6:15 and I know I am going to run out of daylight. I began hiking as fast as I could to stop the shivering. As I picked up my pace I was no longer worried I was a bit scared. Both my arms and legs are cold but sweat begins to once again drip into my eyes as I struggle on. About a half a mile from the shelter a porcupine crosses the trail and I try to take both a video and a picture but it was too dark. I made it to the shelter just a light rain began to fall.

I left the shelter at 4:00 am and hiked in the dark. I wanted to hike as the sun came up. About two miles in I came to a beautiful view ( check pictures) I called Sue as the sun came up to coordinate a mail drop and to tell her about the view. I got into town about 8:00 am and took a long nap.I am looking forward to cleaning and drying out all of my gear. Everything I wear stinks I mean really stinks. I am staying at the Red Carpet Inn and they have a washer and dryer. I wrapped myself up in a towel and took all of my clothes to the washing machine. There were two but only one was working.That is ok by me because I only have two shirts, a pair of hiking pants, two pairs of socks, two pairs of compression underwear, and a handkerchief. There was another hiker there waiting on the drier. As I was putting coins in the washing machine you know the towel had to drop to the floor. I don't know if the guy saw the family jewels or not because when I looked over at him he was looking away. Probably laughing. I have a small one. After laundry and another short nap I went to the Doyle. The Doyle is famous in the hiker community. It is an old run down hotel and a must do for all thru hikers.It cost 25.00 for a room and you share a bathroom and a shower with everyone. It reminds me of the hotels in all the westerns where all the cowboys go to and have their shoot outs. The Hotel looks dirty and I have been warned by reading hiker journals that the rooms are rough. that is why I am staying at the Red Carpet. I ordered a salad and it was very good. All the food that came out of the kitchen looked great as well. The place was full of hikers. Some I have met on the trail and some not. Vicky is the owner and bartender. She is full of hiker stories and wonderful entertainment. Of course I had my picture taken as I sat drinking beer, talking to hikers,and simply enjoying the afternoon. There was a sad note however. Everyone learned that Baltimore Jack died. Baltimore Jock is a very famous hiker that has done the trail many times. He was one of the people I was looking forward to meeting. He will be truly missed. My current hiking companions, Tow Truck and Lois and Clark are taking a zero day tomorrow and I will be joining them as I wait on a mail delivery.

I took my pack off and set it on a picnic table next to two older women. They asked me where I was going. ""MAINE!"" was my respone. We started talking and I must have come across as homeless or something. The next thing I know one of the women hands me a 20.00 dollar bill and said, ""Here honey go get yourself something to eat."" I told her that this was not necessary however she insisted and I couldn't refuse. She said she would follow me on this journal so I want to thank you again.

They last into New Jersey andI just want to make it through them unhurt. When it is raining they are even more dangerous. My plan is to start early and go slow.The sun came out in the early afternoon and dwhile the hike was tough in sope spots I felt fantastic and once I got to the top the ridge it offeered up some great views. I took more pictures today then any other. After I had gotten my tent set up a guy showed up with blood all over hiks arm. He had cut his finger tryilng to open a can. He was drunk and Tow Truck told me he also was carrying a gun. His finger was cut to the bone however at first he refused any help we offered.

He began to rattle as I was just less then two feet away from him. His rattle made me rattle and of course I froze. I wasn't sure what to do he was in a position that was difficult to walk around and I was in no position to make him move.

I was limping pretty bad yesterday but today I am able to put more weight on it. My left foot starting hurting yesterday when I put pressure on the heal it was giving me pain. It got worse as I hiked today and then, to put icing on the cake, I wedged my foot between two rocks and the pain really began. I will start at the beginning. I got into camp early yesterday around three in the afternoon. I was tiried so I pitched my tent and went to sleep. by eleven in the evening I was wide awake. I did not want to stay in the tent until the sun came up so I decided to night hike. I know, I know this is not the smartest move but I thought it was a better idea than lying in my tent wide awake for five hours. The hike began great. I think your senses are keener at night. I believe our five senses our in service to our sixth, and the sixth is the intuitive sense of danger to body or soul. I did feel a bit apprehensive as I began the hike in the darkeness, but I had no sense of danger. all I sensed was the fragrance of the pine-sented crystalline air of the Appalachian Mountains. Until that fragrance became tyhat of a skunk. I never saw the skunk and I wasn't sprayed but he was there and he was close. Anyway, headlamp on high I was doing well listening to the sounds of the night and dodging rocks until about two miles in. My7 foot wedged between two rocks and the pain began. Now I am living up to my trail name and limping. I can only put my weight on the ball of my left foot. This makes the pack jump up and down on my shoulders. This makes for a miserable hike and I have 10 miles to go before any hope of relief. When the sun came up I made it to a shelter beside the trail and I stopped for a nap. I slept for about two hours. This helped. The pain wasn't as bad and the trail got easier for the next two and a half miles. Then more rocks. Then more rocks going up hill.

On the way we decided that it would be better if I went south instead of north so his son would not have as far to drive when it came time to pick me up. When he dropped me off he gave me his Pennsylvania State Troopers velcrow belt because I think he felt sorry for me with my pants falling down all the time. Anyway, there was a pull off to the left at the trailhead and I eagerly jumped out ready to go. I put on my pack, thanked him for the belt, and headed off in the pouring rain, yelling back,""Looking forward to dinner tonight!"" Whenever it is raining really hard my phone doesn't recognize my fingers and I can't get any information from it so I just leave it in my pocket and hike. I didn't get lost because now I'm a professional hiker and I am taking on those wet rocks like there is no tomorrow. I did fall for the first time today, but I didn't get hurt. When I finally made it to route 309 seven hours latter I realized something was wrong. I went north instead of south and now I am more then 30 miles away from where I am supposed to be. Iam soaking wet. I am tired. I am pissed. Forgenately 309 is a major highway and there is a restaurant and bed and breakfast just to my left. Ken, the owner, tells me that since he has to shuttle several hikers in the a.m. If I stay at his place he will shuttle me back to 183 for free. THE TRAIL PROVIDES!! I AM IN!!! I have called for the rest of my gear to be delivered. I have just woken up from a nap and will be getting my gear shortly. After talking to men last night I decided I wanted to get on the trail very early so I could finish up the 24.5 miles from my original plan. He said he had no problem getting to the trail at 4 am (for a fee of 1.00 smile) this means getting up at 3:30 to be ready. It is now 4 am no Ken.","183 going south

People are starting to leave the trail for one reason or another. Captain Jack has left, the Postal Poiet is in the hospital, and Chill Lax broke his metatarsal bone on the rocks and will be off for at least six weeks. I hate to hear about people having to leave the trail. We are all supporting each other and want everyone to succeed. I met Shadow today on the trail. He is from Scanectady New York and is hiking as far as Vermont. The worst part of the Pennsylvania rocks are still ahead. I am dreading the Supperfund area for everything is dead around there due to zinc mining and all you do is hike around huge boulders. That will be coming up in a couple of days.

I did get some great views and took some pictures. I made it through the Knife Edge today. It's a notorious section of rocky trail. You are basically hiking on your hands and knees in some spots and if you do fall it is a long way down. It really wasn't as bad as some hikers made it out to be.

Some great views to start the day however most of the day I was hiking in the green tunnel. I fell twice today. Once as I was hiking up a rock cliff I fell backwards onto my pack and once in the afternoon I tripped/stubbled and fell forward but was able to turn and land on my backpack. Both times I escaped unhurt. I only ran into one other hiker today. He was hiking with his dog. When I reached him his dog was lying on his back and he was lying on his poles. He said he had started at Harper's Ferry a week before I did but he was taking it slow. I asked him if he was O.K. and if he needed anything. He said he was just out of shape and that he would be fine. His original plan was to flip/flop but now he says he just wants to make it to Maine. Right now he said it was all he could muster to get to the next shelter. Both he and the dog looked like they had had enough. I hope he is alright. At the end of the day I was starting to hitchhike into town when I ran into Cookie, another thru hiker that I had met in Ducannon. I was headed into town for supplies and she has a friend that picks her up so they gave me a ride to the store and then we all had dinner. It was a great way to spend the evening. I was glad for the ride for Wind Gap is farther away from the trail then I thought it was.

Wednesday's Entry for Day 27
I have to say why I was glad to leave Pennsylvania. While it has some beautiful views and for the most part is flat, to be honest it really wasn't that much fun. From about Port Clinton on I had to watch every step I made and hiked mostly with my head down. Coming into the Delaware Water Gap he last several miles weren't bad and I saw rhododendron flowers and there wasn't much in the way of rocks. I was worried that I may have broken my metatarsal bone in my right foot and would have to leave the trail like Chill Lax. However a physical therapist at the Church of the Mountain calmed my worries. People on the trail are amazing. When I got up this morning I didn't know if I was going to hike or not. My right foot bothered me most of the night. When I tried to walk into the church from my tent it was hurting when I put any weight on it. I figured it was going to be a zero day. As I said yesterday the hostel was full with most of the thru hikers that I have been hiking with on and off and have met on the trail. Atlas, Cosmos, Bean Dip, Moma Bean, Tomahawk, Traveler, Just Gary, and two hikers from Canada that I didn't know. All of these hikers are faster than me and all do at least 15 miles a day.The reason I haven't seen any hikers on the trail the last couple days is because I think I am in between bubbles. When these guys take a zero day and I don't I can catch up with them by the end of the day. They inspire me not to mention they are great company. Having to take a zero because of foot problems was not something I wanted to do. I do enjoy hiking alone but being alone at the end of the day is really not that much fun. I enjoy sharing pain stories, trail evaluations, equipment advice and the general overall companionship. So, when everyone left for the trail and I didn't I was a little bummed. Then Pastor Mary showed up. She informed me that there was a physical therapist that was a member of her congregation and she would call her and have her take a look at my foot. A half hour latter she was examining my foot. After the usual questions, ""Does this hurt? Does that hurt?"" she informed me that I haven't broken anything. I was so relieved! She gave me the R.I.C.E. advice. (rest, ice, compress, elevate.) She told me that the ankle brace I was wearing was not appropriate for this type of injury because it wasn't giving me support where I needed it. She told me she would go into town and pick up what I needed and be back soon. When she returned she told me the store didn't have the type of bandage that met her qualifications so she whet home and brought gave me one of hers. She instructed me on how to properly wrap my foot, gave me some tape, and wished me luck. ""How much do I owe you my trail angel? ""Nothing. Have a good hike and good luck.""I put an extra 20.00 in the donation box, wrote a thank you note, and less than an hour latter I was back on the trail crossing the Pennsylvania/New Jersey border.","Delaware Water Gap

Step and a Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534741,"The trail today was difficult however New Jersey is a beautiful state. I am developing a new hiking strategy. I am getting up early, very early, 4am. I start hiking before sunrise and hike slow but steady. I don't really stop for lunch for more then 5-10 minutes. I only stop when I am out of breath and need my heart rate to return to normal. This has been allowing me to do more miles without really exhausting myself until the end of the day. Hiking boulders and large rocks is actually easier than hiking medium and smaller rocks. Larger boulders and rocks are fun to me. I can pick a course and navigate across them mostly walking on their tops. If they are really big you do have to get to your hands, knees, and butt however for the most part it is a fun challenge. Medium and smaller rocks are a different story. I am constantly stubbing my toe, twisting my ankle, having to use my poles to keep from falling or stumbling. These are the rocks that messed up my foot. these are the rocks that are the bain of my current existence. These are the rocks that attack me each day. These are the rocks that I must conquer. I am out of Pennsylvania however New Jersey still has about 44 miles of rocks. To me, it is kinda like the 15th round of a heavy weight fight. I'm injured, i'm hurting, (to be honest sometimes almost to tears) but there is no way they are calling this fight. I do think I hiked to long today. I know I can't keep up with the stronger hikers, and need to hike less miles. Usually I start out saying I will only hike 15 miles today but as I get going and my body gets into it I just don't stop. I am going to try to make it to Unionville tomorrow. My phone is getting low and I only have two charges left on my charger. Hopefully I can also update my journal. There is an owl somehere in the distance. It is hooting me to sleep.","Tent Site Marker 1307.9

Step and a Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534746,"******* Sorry this is the crazy entry not Thursday. When you are on the trail you lose track of days. First let me say this: My phone was almost dead and my charger only had one charge left. My plan was to go to Unionville, charge everything up, shower, eat, and maybe drink a bottle of wine. There is a place called Village Office where thru hikers can tent for free and it is only a half a mile from the trail. Oh but that half of a mile. I don't know how many miles I have walked so far but that 2,640 feet will be remembered as a half a mile that I should have walked but didn't.                                HERE IS THE STORYI know it is only a half a mile but it is not part of the trail so if I can get a ride I'm taking it. I start walking west... I start hitch hiking. When I hitch hike and walk at the same time I don't turn and face the cars. I just walk and stick my thumb out. The first car the goes by? A new York State trooper. he puts his lights on and pulls over about ten yards in front of me. I walk up to the passenger side window. He brings it down. He is young, got himself a crew cut just like me and says, ""What are you doing out here?"" I have to stop here for a second and tell you something I have developed that I think helps me with my interpersonal relationships with people I meet along the trail. When people ask me this question I say this: ""I'm John Baldwin and I am hiking the Appalachian Trail. I just retired from being a special education teacher for the Buffalo Public Schools and I am doing this as a retirement present to myself."" These two sentences, in my mind, works on several levels. I believe the special education teacher bit makes some people think I am an angel sent from God. The Buffalo Public Schools adds that I am inner city my job must have been hell as I tried to help the most needy and those jobs take a special kind of a person. This must mean I am a SPECIAL ANGEL sent from God. Using the retirement word twice in the same sentence? In my mind this makes people think I walk on water. This is what I think.  I start my line..""Hello officer I am hiking the Appalachian Trail I just....""""Do you know it is illegal to hitch hike?""  Wait a minute my line is not working here. Maybe I should show him my recently acquired velcroed Pennsylvania state trooper belt. This will show him we are buds. I think better of it and say, ""Yes, to be honest, I do officer.""   ""This road is dangerous and you are walking on it instead of on the side. Where are you going? Let me see your I.D."" \   I tell him where I am going and he gives me back my I.D.    ""Listen, you walk on the side of the road and I don't want to come back here and see you sticking your thumb out.""   ""Yes officer."" He leaves. I walk. I walk no more than 50 yards when a car pulls over in front of me. (I didn't have my thumb out) Again, I walk up to the window. Again the window comes down. A women that reminds me of an older and shorter version of Rosie O'Donnell says, ""Are you O.K.? Do you need a ride?"" I accept immediately but at first I can't get in the front seat because it is full of empty Gatorade bottles. She throws the bag into the back seat which is also full of mostly empty Gatorade bottles. There is a half of one between her legs and I say, ""We have something in common. I like the orange Gatorade too."" As I throw my pack on top of the fortune of returnables in the back seat. "" Where are you going? I tell her.    Again she asked,""Are you O.K.?    I show her the bandage that has been wrapped around my right foot and ankle all day and say, ""My foot hurts a little but I am going to be fine. Thanks so much for picking me up."" I ask her her name and start my line.. ""I'm John Baldwin etc, etc. I think it is working but there is something wrong. I can't quite put my finger on it. She misses my drop off point and when I tell her she tell me I am right then pulls over to begin to turn around. Then I realize what is not right. She is drunk.    I am telling you this now in an effort of full disclosure. I want you to know that I was aware of this before I made my bad decisions. As we approach my destination she says, "" Do you need anything? Do you want to go to the store?""  I did. I wanted some ice for my ankle and maybe pick up something beside trail food. ""Thats so kind of you, is there a store nearby?  ""I'll take you to get whatever you need."" We bypass my destination and off we go. She is staying between the lines so I am a little less worried.    Then she says, Why do you want to stay in a tent? You can stay at my house. I live on an 80 acre farm with a big pond, ducks and geese, and sheep. You can stay at my house if you want you know you will be more comfortable than in a tent.""   I am not sure she really said that last sentence maybe I was thinking it.  My response: ""That's O.K. I wouldn't want to impose.
She assured me that I would be no trouble at all and that I would be stupid to stay in a tent when I could stay at her beautiful farm. Now I am thinking about it.
Where do you think the ice was?... Right next to a liquor store.
""How far away is this farm.?"" 
""Not far at all."" I'm in.
I go into the liquor store, buy a bottle of Merlot and she picks up a cheep bottle of vodka. I pay for both bottles, get the ice, open the passenger door.
When I get back in the car I find out why there are so many empty bottles of Gatorade. She opens up the bottle of vodka and tops off the orange mixture that has now become the color of weak tea, and away we go. 
This farm is a lot farther than she let on but I am trying to relax and go with the flow. Then she hits me with the first of two bombshells. 
""I hope you like cats because I have 10 of them. I have three adults and seven kittens.""
Now those of you that know me know I love all animals. Mostly I am a dog man and if you put all the animals in the world on a list and I had to rate them from best loved to least- cats would be second to the last beating only snakes. I don't tell her this. I say, ""I like cats, especially if they are friendly."" I was thinking of my neighbors cats and hoping they were like them. She informed me that the adults are not friendly at all but the kittens are very lovable. She is starting to cross the yellow line too much for my comfort. I try to keep her engaged and focused on the road. I want to make to this beautiful farm house with the pond, the ducks, the geese, the sheep, and now the cats. I tell her that she was very kind to pick me up. She tells me that she always tries to help people and wants to be kind to everyone. Then comes bombshell number two. 
""I live with my boyfriend and he is not as nice as me."" WHAT? I am positive she said this last sentence. I wasn't thinking it.
""Don't worry I can handle him."" Oh s**t Am I going to find myself tied to a pole in this women's basement? 
Then she says,"" I used to live in Las Vegas, I was a showgirl and I was very cute when I was younger."" Oh boy, even if I was forced to help this lady out I couldn't/ Viagra was not something I thought I would need I this trip.
There it was just like she said. I notice the pond first. Then the geese, then the ducks. Then the for sale sign. Then the beautiful farm house that sat on a hill to the right. Then the sheep. When I saw the sheep I didn't think of a Norman Rockwell painting. I thought of Silence of the Lambs. Am I about to be screamed at:""PUT THE LOTION IN THE BASKET!!!
We approached the beautiful farmhouse. We went by the beautiful farmhouse. We continued up a slight hill to what appeared to be the farmhand's home. This is alright with me for I made it and I need rest. It is now dark. With ice, backpack and wine I enter first into a vestibule. Then the kitchen. Then the smell. Cats are running between my legs. 
Then she says, ""Oh that's why I went out I was suppose to get kitty liter. The smell was so bad I was gagging. I really didn't think I could stay here. There was a native american blanket hanging over the entrance to the kitchen. She tells me that I can put my things in the room to the left. When I do the smell has dissipated. The room is surprisingly clean. When I come back out she tells me I can go anywhere I fell comfortable except her bedroom. O.K. now I am feeling better as I sit down on one of two futons that are in the living room which is also very clean. There is a coffee table with a make your own cigarette machine and loose tobacco sitting in the middle. Rosie puts my ice in two sandwich bags and I use my ace bandage to tie them on both sides of my ankle. Rosie brings me a wine glass, I pour, ask her to join me, she says no she is going to watch t.v. in her bedroom, and with her permission I elevate my foot and put it on the coffee table. After about a glass and a half of wine everything is good with the world and I fall asleep. 
I am awaken by what I think is Tony Montana and Dirty Harry all rolled into one. ""WHAT THE F**K IS HE DOING HERE YOU CRAZY BITCH!! 
Now this isn't the first time I have been woken up by an irate boyfriend. I'm pretty much a pro at this. I start my line, ""Hi I am John Baldwin I am hiking the Appalachian Trail... 
I DON'T GIVE A F**K WHO YOU ARE YOU CAN NOT STAY HERE DUDE. GET YOUR F**king foot out of my tobacco. 
""I am sorry sir, I rally am. i have a tent I could pitch in your yard if that would make you feel more comfortable."" I am thinking, Please don't make me say hello to your littal friend, I do not want to make your day, PLEASE DO NOT SHOOT ME. 
It is at this point that we talk. After awhile he allows me to stay in the room. The next morning while he is making coffee and getting ready for work he explains to me that he is only renting and he doesn't want the land lord to think he is letting people stay in his home. He then drives me back to the trail head. They were both very caring , nice people. I was the one at fault. As I began to hike I realized I had forgotten to charge my cell phone.

There were a couple of tough climbs today but I want to focus on where I am staying and the beauty of a shower. I haven't had a shower in six days. I stink. I couldn't get someplace to stay in Fort Montgomery so I hitch hiked to Stony Point Center a retreat that has a mission to accept all religions and work together to make the word better. I can't help to think, or at least I hope that in small way they have made me a better person and that was just over dinner. First, let me tell you that this is the perfect place to take a zero. The food is all homemade and most of it is organic from their garden. For 50. 00 (hiker fee) you get a room and breakfast. An extra 15.00 you get dinner. It is a retreat for people of faith from all religions. Last night I had dinner with about 30 people representing a variety of faiths that are on a 200 mile march to Albany to protest the treatment of farm workers in New York State.The stories that some of these workers tell about their job conditions and low pay that never even equals minimum wage I thought no longer existed in my home state. After dinner I did a presentation on how to deal with foot pain. (I am now considered an expert on this topic) Since I had two extra pairs of toe socks I gave two of the marchers each a pair to wear on their journey. I wish them all well and hope they can achieve their goal of at least getting minimum wage like every other worker in this state.

The first thing I do when I'm in Connecticut? I get lost. I read that there are 80,900 white blazes on the Appalachian Trail. I just can't seem to find them. Actually I wasn't paying attention to what I was doing. I started walking down what I think was a old logging road when I realized I was off trail. Way off trail, like more than a half mile off trail. I checked my gps and knew that I had to get to the Ten Mile River and follow it north. As I was hiking to the river I went past what appeared to be a summer home that was all boarded up. Next to the house was a path leading down to the river. Next to the river was a bench, a chair, a table and a grill. I sat on the bench and rested a bit then went in naked. The water almost came up to my waist and felt great. This was the first time getting lost worked out in my favor. When I got into Kent I was hot, tired, and hungery. The first thing I did was get something to eat at an air conditioned bakery. Then Ieent to do my laundry. While washing my clothes I met a wonderful woman named Marcy. She is a special education teacher as well and has been teaching for 34 years. We hit it off right away. I told I was planning on staying in town for the night but my trail guide tells me that it is expensive especially on the weekends so I asked her for a recommendation. She got on the phone and found me a motel that is about 10 miles out of town for 80.00 Then she offered to drive me there when my clothes were done. There was an IGA nearby so I resupplied while waiting for my clothes. When Marcy came back I was trying to decide if I was going to take a zero when she told me there was a Memorial Day parade tomorrow and a cummunity picnic. That clinched it. I offered to buy her dinner tomorrow and I am looking forward to a easy day tomorrow. I have just woken up from a long nap and life is good. Even my feet love me tonight. Can life get any better?","Wiley Shelter

It was raining this morning so the parade got canceled. The picnic did not so I went there to get something to eat. I then decided I would hike because the heat and humidity was down. Eric, a guy from the picnic that I met gave me a ride to the motel to pick up my pack and then gave me a ride to the trail head. People in Kent were just fantastic and was a great little town filled with interesting and caring people. Again I want to give a special thanks to Eric and Marcy. There were many ups and downs leaving Kent for about six miles but then you hike along the river and it is pretty flat. the last two miles before the Shelter were tough on my legs. I was tired and it was dark when I got there. As soon as I got in my tent I was asleep. I think this was the first night I slept through the night without even getting up to take a pee.","Kent Connecticut

This was a great day to hike and I am glad I made it to this great house with a sweet lady named Maria. I highly recommend this place and she is in the awol for all thru hikers behind me.

It is so much easier when you don't have a 30 pound pack to carry. I made it back to Maria's around 4:30 a little tired but happy. I got some beautiful pictures today. Even though the hike was tough at first I thought the hike up Mt Everett wasn't as bad as Guthooks makes it look. I have enjoyed staying here with Maria. She is an 87 year old women that has been taking in hikers for 17 years and has many great hiker stories. I taught her how to play pitch and she entertained me throughout the evening with her wonderful sense of humor. This will be my last entry for awhile because I plan on staying in the mountains most of the next week in order to make it to Bennington Vt. by next Wednesday or Thursday. I have family there and will be taking several days off. I plan on doing 15 mile days until I get there but as always plans can change.,"Salisbury Connecticut

I have finished Connecticut and I am in the lower elevations of Massachusetts and I have never been swarmed with so many mosquitoes, flies, and gnats. I hiked through a swamp and across the Housatonic River accompanied by nothing but bugs and I didn't have a bug net for my head. I was asked a very interesting question by a boy that was hiking with what I think was an outward bound group doing section hiking today. I guess I was a bit of a celebrity because I was a thru hiker going to Maine. The first question they asked me was what do I eat. Jokingly I told them bugs, grasshoppers, worms, gnats, and if I am really lucky an occasional chip monk. The question that really got me thinking was ""What do I think about?"" this question was something I wasn't prepared for. I know that most hikers think about food. I don't. I think about how far the next shelter is, I think about how lucky I am to be able to do this, I think about the people I meet on the trail, I think about the views, I think about the people that love me and how I can be a better person and show them I love them, I think about my daughter telling me that she is proud of me for doing this and how I can develop a better relationship with her, but mostly, to be honest, I just think about how not to think about the pain in my legs and how to get over the next mountain.

I was talking to day hikers Andrea and Jim and the recommended I take the Cobblestone side trail to get some great views of Williamstown. It was about 1.5 miles off trail but it was worth it. I got some great pictures of both the Green Mountains and Massachusetts. Finishing Massachusetts was the highlight of my day. I forgot my water purifier so I stopped at Pete's Spring early in the hike and I didn't really need water but I figured I would be safer drinking directly from a spring so filled up.

My sister Betsy will be picking me up at 5 a.m. and I will be hiking 21.6 miles. I have changed plans because they are predicting thunderstorms and I don't want to hike that many miles in the rain so I am jumping ahead and going from Stratton-Arlington Road to Manchester Center which is only 16.7.

I fell hard yesterday and I just hope I haven't re-injured my back. I was hit by a car on November 14 2013 and broke three vertebrae in my back. Yesterday I was hiking when my right foot hit a rock and I started stumbling. I tried to catch myself with my poles and twisted my back, dropped my left pole then twisted again and fell forward. I landed I my right side and face. When I tried to get up the pain shot up the left side of my back. It reminded me of when I was hit by the car. I knew right away that I had hurt myself so I just laid on the trail on top of my pack for about 10 minutes. I was half hoping that someone would come down the trail. I was also hoping that the pain would go away. It didn't. It got worse. I took my pack off while I was still on the ground then I got to my knees and then stood up. I found a relatively flat spot and blew up my mattress and laid down for about an hour. It didn't help.    I knew I couldn't put my pack back on so I just dragged it to the road that fortunately was only about a quarter of a mile. I hitched hiked into Hanover then went to the shelter which is about a mile from town. The pain wasn't any better so that is why I came here. I am now laying here listening to the beep of the monitors. I just got done talking with the doctor. They looked at the x rays and compared them to my x rays from Buffalo General. The doctor feels that it is a bad muscle injury. He doesn't think I re-injured my back however he is not completely sure. His advice is to rest for several days then try to hike. If the pain comes back I may have to reevaluate and consider ending my hike. This to me is unthinkable.
