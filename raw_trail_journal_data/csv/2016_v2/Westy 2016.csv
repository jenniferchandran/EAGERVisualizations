Westy 2016,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521796,"Hello, My name is Rob Potvin but on the trail I will go by WESTY. That'e because I drive and camp in a 1987 VW Vanagon Wesfalia; affectionately know by their owners as ""Westy"".I plan on hike NoBo (Northbound) starting at Springer Mountain on or about March 16th. I will not start in a downpour or blizzard; preferring to wait a day or two for a little better weather.My goal is to hike 100 miles a week so I will hike six to eight days a week depending on trail conditions and how I feel. Obviously if I hide too many eight day weeks my end date will extend past my current plan of September 4th.My wife Kathy and I live in Topsham Maine. We are retired and greatly enjoy the outdoors. Her support, both materially and emotional are key to my success. Three times during the hike, setting out from Springer, on the Blue Ridge Parkway and In the White Mountains, she will meet me every evening for a week or so, transport me to a campground and urge me on. In doing this I will have the luxury of slack Packing (hiking with a daypack) for a few days when I'll appreciate it the most; starting out and during a couple strenuous mountain passages.Kathy will also coordinate my mail drops of which 16 are planned. The combination of mail drops, Kathy meeting me and a few nights in trail towns will mean I will have very little food shopping to do on the trail. That should help me eat healthy most of the way.Well, that is it for now. I hope to write one more pre-hike journal entry and then do and entry or three each week while on the trail. If I can figure out how to do it I will include photos of some of the sights that I think worth sharing.WESTY",,Springer Mountain,"Feb 25, Thu",0
Westy 2016,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521874,"Hello again. This entry is going to be short; I simply want to talk a bit about what I have been doing to get in shape and our mail drop plans.Since I will have the luxury of slack packing for the first hundred miles, I am depending on those early miles to get my trail legs. With that in mind I have concentrated on walking and exercises to prepare for the hike. I walk on average 6 miles a day on rolling terrain with hikes up and down moderate (1,000 foot) mountains every week or two. I also do lots of knee bends and squats. I wore hip belt with 15 points in it for a couple of weeks but it didn't wear like my backpack and it made my lower back sore so I quit that. I had no trouble carrying a loaded pack on the two longish hikes I used it with so I am hoping wearing a pack won't be a problem once my legs are in shape.We have managed to assemble most of the food that we will mail drop. Fifteen mail drops containing about eighty meals, replacement socks, tooth paste and many quarter rolls of toilet paper are piled on our guest room bed. We will be using USPS Priority Mail boxes.",,Springer Mountain,"Feb 26, Fri",0
Westy 2016,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521942,"I spent a bit of time yesterday tuning up my electronics for the hike. My smartphone (a Apple 6S Plus) is the core element; it will be my phone, camera, dairy, guidebook, compass, alarm clock, weather forecaster and navigation device. My guidebook is AWOL's. My navigation app is Guthooks. My weather forecaster is Appalachian Trail Weather. This weather site gives weather forecasts for each shelter along the AT. Besides my smartphone I'll carry a charger/flashlight. The one I picked is a 6000mAh Jackery Bar; this charges my smartphone one and one half times. Also among my electronics is a SteriPEN UV water purifier.WESTY",,Springer Mountain,"Feb 27, Sat",0

The Approach Trail is very difficult with an elevation gain of almost 2,000 feet. When I arrived at the top, tired and sweaty but excited to have made it, there were several other thru hikers and a dozen or so day hikers lounging on the rocks. I wrote a short message in the log book and continued on to Springer Mountain Shelter 0.2 miles down the trail. I set up my tent, ate supper (chili Mac and cheese), hung my food bag on the bear cables and crawled into my tent. I was asleep by 7:30. A great start!","Springer Mountain

Used the privy (quite an experience), fetched my food bag, cooked two packets of oatmeal and one of hot chocolate then took down my tent and packed everything up. On the trail by 9:00. Lots of ups and downs with many pretty overlooks which were a great excuse to stop and rest; often with other hikers. Bright, warm sunny day; absolutely quiet except for the occasional chirping of birds. I was passed by several hikers; some thru hikers and some day hikers. Several kids on spring break. I arrived at Hawk Mountain Shelter at 3:00 and set up my tent. Setting up your tent right away to claim a good spot with few roots and rocks seems to be the thing to do. I had just taken off my shoes when Kath came walking up. What a pleasant surprise! She had managed to drive to Hightower Gap any walked the half mile up to the shelter to meet me. I took down my tent, packed up and together we hiked to Hightower Gap and slept in our Vanagon for the night.","Springer Mountain Shelter

This was a hard day both because the effort started to add up and because two mountains, Sassafras and Justus, had to be crossed. The AT seems to meander around looking for ups and downs and challenging rock scrambles. Flat sections happen just often enough to keep you going. Many more people on the trail today. I walked with several thru hikers on various stretches. I met Kathy again late this afternoon; she had walked up from Gooch Gap. When we got to Gooch Gap there was a St Patrick's Day party going on. There were many past and current thru hikers with buckets of beer, piles of hot dogs and a promise of a corn beef and cabbage feast several hours later. We visited a while, I had one beer and we headed for the van for supper and some quiet time. We were in bed by 7:30 and asleep soon after waking only occasionally to the sound of a party that went on until well after midnight.","Hightower Gap

By 9:00 I was on my way up Blood Mountain, the highest point I the AT in Georgia at 4,461 feet. Very tough climb with lots of switch backs and slippery rocky patches. Halfway up I happened upon another thru hiker that walked about the same pace as I did and we walked together, single file and switching the lead to the top. Hiking with him made it go a bit easier. His trail name is Reading Man and he is from Penn. When we got to the top we were in a cloud so no views to be seen. Blood Mountain Shelter was, however, quite a site. It is a stone shelter built by the CCC in 1934 and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Hiked down the mountain to Neel Gap where I met Kathy. Neel Gap has a famous hostel and outfitter which was teeming with tourists buying tee shirts and hikers eating pizza. We shopped for a bit and hexed for Vogel State Park a fees miles away where we got s campsite.","Jarrard Gap

Wonderful clear blue skies and views everywhere I look. I am fortunate to be here this early in the year as there are no leafs on any of the trees (""all hardwoods, no pines) so there are unobstructed views everywhere. Later in the year I would be hiking in a green tunnel.

Nice rolling hills with only one mountain, Buzzard's Knob, to climb. I was rewarded near the end of the day with a sign announcing the Georgia/North Carolina line. I'm told the 25% of hikers starting the AT quit before this point so I'm feeling pretty good about my effort. I spent the night on a tent site on the side of a hill and learned quite a lesson. I set up my tent so the slope was from shoulder to shoulder instead of fro head to foot; bad decision. I spent the entire night fighting to keep from sliding off my air mattress.","Dick's Creek Gap

Pleasant walk down the mountain with several ups and downs and many nice overlooks. About a half hour away from Deep Gap I met Kathy coming south on the trail. We walked the way together. When we reached Deep Gap we came upon the Omelet Angels, a group of former thru hikers and their supporters, having a gigantic trail magic event. They had tables piled with food and drink and all kinds of snacks. They also had a roaring fire and lots of real chairs to sit on (I think I miss sitting in a real chair about as much as any physical comfort I miss on the trail) We ate some wonderful NC pulled pork, baked beans, potato salad and cole slaw.

There were made to order omelets, hash brown casserole and fruit. They even packed up to order sandwiches on home made bread for each hiker to take with them for that night's supper. What a great way to celebrate Easter Sunday. I finally got out on the trail at 11:00 and immediately had to struggle up Standing Indian Mountain, the first 5,000 footer on the AT at 5498 feet. It was, thankfully, a long 2 mile steady incline with a few switchbacks that I managed to complete by 1:00. There were great views from the top.

Soon after going to bed I thought it started to rain but the rain was odd, sporadic with brief downpours and periods of nothing. In the morning another hiker explained to me that water from the clouds condensed on the tree branches and ""rained"" to the ground when the wind blew. The hike today was up and down and very easy until the approach to Albert Mountain which became steadily steeper. The final two tenths of a mile was a 400 foot very steep scramble up slippery racks and steep log and rock steps. At some points it was downright dangerous. At the top was a fire tower and a spectacular view. During a long break at the top a fellow hiker told me that half way up the scramble we has passed the 100 mile mark on the trail. It was a short down hill walk to the shelter where I pitched my tent, had supper, talked for a while with other hikers and went to bed by 8:00.","Carter Gap Shelter

Again Kathy met me about a mile from my day's destination and we walked together down a long pretty trail. Soon after meeting Kathy I realized I need to ""drop a deuce"" as it is called on the trail. I waited until we came to a fairly level area where I could get 100 or so feet off the trail without having to climb up or down a steep embankment and found a suitably big tree to get behind and out of view of the trail. I dug my little hole and tended to business (hitting the hole dead center (I'm getting pretty good at this) then scooped the dirt over the hole. I looked around for a rock to put over the spot (not required but I do it when I can) and spotted one leaning against my tree. I picked it up and was surprised to see a glass jar with a geo catching label hidden under it. What are the chances, with miles of trail and hundreds of thousands of trees, that I and someone else would pick the same one.

Westy 2016,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526407,"Today started out cold and cloudy. By 10:00 it was sprinkling and by noon it was pouring. There was a long steady 4 1/2 mile climb to the top of Siler's Bald at 5207 feet then a steep, knee jarring decent to Wayah Gap at 4143 feet. The trail then climbed to the top of Wayah Bald at 5342 feet. No vows from either because of the weather. At the summit of Wayah Bald I took refuge in an old stone tower to rest and change socks. I made the mistake of putting my hat on the sill of a window in the tower and had to chase it down a 50 foot bank; just what I needed to be doing. The duo pour slowed a bit and I made the mile downhill dash to the Eayah Bald Shelter. When I got there it was jammed with hikers; a few even planning on sleeping on the wet concrete floor. Another hiker and I pushed on and found small clearing about a mile past the shelter where we set up our tents. When I crawled into my tent I was soaked and within a few minutes discovered pools of water on the floor of my tent. The was carried in by me and my gear and during the setup process. I had to use some of my extra dry clothes to mop it up before I could roll out my sleeping bag. I just finished with all this and the rain let up and there was even a glimpse of blue sky. I hung some of my wetter stuff to dry ( with minimal success), ate supper and went to bed. About 8:00 it started storming again with lightning ( I couldn't hear any thunder over the sound of rain on the tent). Slept the sleep of the exhausted.","Winding Stair Gap

The hiking today was very,very difficult with three steep accents all to over 5000 feet (carrying all that wet gear didn't help); Copper Ridge Bald, Rocky Ridge Bald and Wesser Bald.

Arrived at the NOC at just past 1:00 and went to the general store to get change for the dryers and buy a couple of Cherry Cokes ( I have been craving Cherry Coke). After drying my clothes rented a small cabin with bunks for up to four which I shared with a hiking buddy, trail named Cotton.

On the way up I passed the Wade Sutton Memorial; a plaque honoring a firefighter who died there fighting a forest fire. The weather was perfect for hiking; sunny and in the 60's most of the day. The views were almost everywhere especially at overlooks and mountain peaks. At one rest stop I watched a hawk soaring on the mountain thermals for ten minutes. This was a great treat as hawks are my favorite birds. Cheoah Bald was very different from any previous bald in that it was topped by a couple acres of grass and not rock. I payed on the grass for twenty minutes just soaking in the sunshine ( and recovering from the climb). The hike down may have been harder than the hike up. There were many very steep places and long stairways of steps way to high to step down; every one rough on the knees.

At mile one I came to what my guide book simply called ""start of Jacob's Ladder"". Since the guide does not show an end to Jacob's Ladder I am not sure how much of the next 10 miles of very difficult hiking it entailed. The first 0.6 miles would have rated a name; it seemed nearly straight up with an elevation gain of over 600 feet. It was very cold (down mitten cold) and the numerous rest stops (25 steps then rest) gave me plenty of time to dream about my cozy sunroom in Maine. After the initial climb came more ups and downs each a little harder than the one before until the ten mile mark when the trail turned almost straight down with a drop of 1700 feet in just four miles. Much of the decent was either leaf covered (slippery leaves) or slippery rocks. The leaf covered sections were so treacherous that I had to take the rubber tips off of my hiking sticks to get any traction at all. The views most of the day, however, were spectacular especially the last couple of miles when I could catch glimpses of first Fontana Lake then Fontana Dam.

If a shelter is full when a non thru hiker arrives a thru hiker in the shelter must get out and tent. Because of this (and mice, spiders and snoring) many thru hikers, including me, tent instead of sheltering. Today's hike started by crossing Fontana Dam, the highest dam east of the Mississippi.

Things even got better when I discovered trail magic, two coolers of soft drinks and three bins of fruit and snacks, in the Lindamood School; a one room school built in 1894 and used until 1937. kathy's drive wasn't so good.

From there it was an easy 2 1/2 mile descent to Lynn Creek where I had lunch sitting on a large rock overlooking this swollen creek. While I ate three thru hikers stopped to get water and we chatted while they dipped their bladders and filtered the water. They told me that they had started the trail on March 19th; only 4 days after I had. That I was keeping up with their young legs was more a testament to their partying lifestyle than to my hiking abilities. From this creek, after a climb up and down Lynn Camp Mountain, I came to the base of Chestnut Knob, a steep mountain rising nearly 2100 feet, the last 700 feet up an almost treeless, grassy knob where the trail wound and looped as though a cow had decided on the path it would take. At the top of the knob stands the Chestnut Knob Shelter; an old fire warden's cabin which was converted to an enclosed trail shelter.

Despite the weather the hike today was easier than most days; a hint maybe of the easier hiking promised by the trail guides and section hikers that would be encountered as I got deeper into Virginia. Today started with a long, gentle descent of 1500 feet over the three miles to Jenkins Shelter. At the shelter the trail started following an old road bed and stayed on it for nearly 6 miles. The roadbed was easy ti discern but had obviously been out of use for a long time as evidenced by trees, some up to 18 inches in diameter, growing in the center of it. At first the roadbed led up a gradual slope climbing 600 feet then along the top of a fairly narrow ridge. The roadbed followed a much easier route than the trail typically did (the trail seems to seek out the most difficult way to get from here to there where as roads seem to seek out the easiest route) and was a real pleasure to walk on. There were few rocks to avoid and even fewer tree roots trying to trip me up. Then abruptly the the roadway went straight and the trail veered up and the going got much more difficult with lots of rocks, roots and slimy mud to deal with. All was not bad, however, because the change in route brought the trail through an extended section of mountain laurel just starting to bloom and beautiful to look at. The last couple of miles of the day were a roller coaster small, 300 foot or so, ups and downs that led me to Kimberling Creek where Kathy was waiting.

At higher elevations the clouds I was walking through were wet with moisture which continually fogged my glasses. After climbing 700 feet or so the trail followed a relatively level (relatively level on the AT means the ups and downs are less than 200 feet) for 9 1/2 miles. At about noon the weather took a turn for the worse with driving rain and occasional downpours the rest of the day. The trail turned to a quagmire of slippery mud and deep puddles which were terribly difficult to walk without slipping and sliding and covering me ankle deep in slimy mud. Then I came to a grassy area, probably someone's cow field, which offered an option of walking through 2 foot high grass with hidden, sometimes fresh, cow plops or on the muddy, slippery footpath. I tried some of each and didn't particularly enjoy either one. I was miserable; my feet soaked, my legs covered with mud and my body wet under my rain gear. I sure was happy when I spotted the Vanagon on route 606. Before I got in I stripped off my wet footwear and outer clothes and put on dry stuff. Once in I quickly warmed up. When Kathy asked if we should find tomorrow's pickup spot on the way to the campground I told her I didn't think I'd be hiking tomorrow; I needed a day for me and the trail to dry out.

There were lots of stream crossings but even those were't so bad because of strategically placed rocks they made ""steam hopping"" a breeze. Even the mud was manageable. Then came the day's challenging climb; an ascent of over 1450 feet in just under two miles to the top of an unnamed ridge. It seemed like every step was a challenge with either deep mud, loose rocks or slippery leaves just waiting for a false step. The loose rocks were a particular pain today ( I didn't realize until done hiking that I had forgotten to put the liners, removed for drying, back in my trail runners before I put them on in the morning).

The muddiest was the descent from a place called Angel's Rest at 3550 feet to Lane Street in Pearisburg at 1650 feet. If I was really brave and really expert at slalom skiing I think I could have skied a good way down on the mud (it was that light brown, super slippery mud; the kind of mud that potters use). But, of course, one mistake or unseen rock would have meant disaster so I resorted to baby steps with trekking poles fully in play all the way down.

On the second step down both my feet went out from under me and, quick as a wink, I was on my back at the bottom of the steps.

The skies were stormy looking and the wind was fierce. Fierce enough that I had to really tighten down on the bungee cord at the back of my cap to keep it from being ripped from my head. For a couple of miles the trail was very exposed and the wind didn't let up at all. Soon I felt a headache coming on; my first hiking the trail. It got bad enough that I stopped and took a couple of Ibuprofen. After another hour it was worse. I wondered if the wind was somehow causing it and remembered tightening down on my cap's bungee cord. I loosened it and within two minutes my headache was gone. I guess I won't do that again.

The captain, a former marine, lives just across a wide ( maybe 40 feet ) stream from the trail and welcomes hikers to use his facilities, plug into his power, use his porch if it is raining and set up tents on his lawn. To get across the stream you must use a ""zip-line"" ( a cable and pulley system with a wooded seat ) he installed a cross it. I took pictures of the system but didn't give it a try.

The trail then headed down some 1300 feet to lush pasture lands with cattle in one field and horses in another. The views from here were beautiful and I took my time, stopping often just to look around. Near the bottom there was a huge oak tree; The Keefer Oak. It is the largest oak tree on the AT at more than 18 feet in diameter and dwarfs all the trees around it. The trail then headed back up to a long ridge punctuated by Bruisers Knob at 3417 feet. After this knob came a half mile or more of ledge rock; jagged slabs of rock sloping steeply toward a sheer drop of hundreds of feet. Many of the rocks overlapped requiring climbing from one to another. If you were to slip or stumble down one the only thing to stop you would be small bushes near the top or hard ground at the bottom.

Soon after the bench I came to a short side trail to the Audie Murphy Memorial. He was the most decorated American soldier off World War Two and died in a plane crash near the site of the memorial. From there the trail headed down to Trout Creek then up another 1470 feet to the summit of Cove Mountain (making this a two major summit day - I think the first since NC). This climb had many, many false summits; usually steep rock outcroppings which, of course, the trail went over instead of around, and ended near the biggest outcropping of them all; a place called Dragon's Tooth. The trail down started with a VERY steep, technically difficult rock scramble with nearly vertical drops where I could just barely reach the next hand or foot hold. One section had steel rungs attached to the rock which helped considerably. After getting down this the trail got less steep and a little easier and I could make better progress.

At the top was a half mile cliff walk similar but easier than the ledges of to days earlier. The mid morning sun was the biggest problem on those exposed rock slabs. After crossing the cliffs the trail plunged down to a closed shelter ( closed to overnight use because of lots of bear activity - like walking into the shelter and grabbing gear and food bags). The privy still worked well and the spring was still good for water so I used both before moving on.

He turned a kind of look back at me just as I took it. He disappeared into the brush and I waited several minutes before continuing down the trail. Once.

The trail out of Loft Mountain Shelter had many ups and downs but few rocks and lots of pine needles made the walking easy on the legs and feet. I saw 4 more bears today; one very large one was quietly sitting a dozen feet from the trail eating leaves or something and looked like it was daring me to continue down the trail. Well, I didn't dare and just backed up a bit and waited for him to move and finally it wandered away into the woods. The other three were well off the trail and I walked by them like they weren't there. The final limb up to Hightop Hut was a steep 600 foot climb. When I got to the hut it was only 3:30 so I had my pick of the tent spots. I set up my tent and went tithe shelter where a AT Ridge-Runner was just taking out her pack. We talked for an hour or so before any other hikers arrived. It turns out she is a two time through hiker; one a traditional NOBO and one a flip-flop. Her flip-flop was from Springer to Harper's Ferry and then from Katahdin to Harper's Ferry. She told me the flip flop avoided the summer heat of Pennsylvania and the fall cold of New Hampshire and Maine. She said that this year flip flopping would minimize the problem of trail overcrowding and eliminate any chance of not finishing the hike before Katahdin was closed. I will think seriously about this option because, for me, there is the opportunity to spend a couple of days at home in Maine on the way north. More hikers arrived and ended our discussion.

After my snack I attacked the 1100 foot climb to the summit of Baldface Mountain and then another descent, this one only 700 feet to Lewis Mountain Campground. I had heard on the trail that, because it was a weekend, this campground, used mostly by car campers, would be full. I decided to walk through it to see if, by chance, there was an available campsite. I was glad I did when I heard someone calling out my trail name. It was 3 hikers I frequently camped near camped on two camp spaces which allowed two tents on each. They asked if I wanted to join them and a happily agreed.

I got a couple of BLTs and a large Gatorade and ate at a picnic table (thru hikers are usually too stinky to sit inside when the weather is nice outside) with another hiker and two Harley guys. After lunch I continued on the trail for a mile and a half when I came to Big Meadows Campground where I decided to search out the restrooms (flush toilets are rarely bypassed on the AT).

After hitting the trail again I spotted two bear cubs about 40 feet off the trail with no mamma bear in sight. Not seeing the mamma bear was very disconcerting because I didn't want to be between the mamma and her cubs. I stood very still for several minutes (seemed like hours) searching for mamma and watching the cubs play (they really are cute) and finally took a deep breath and hurried down the trail. When I got to Byrds Nest #3 Hut there was a good sized bear only 50 feet away, on the side trail to the spring, sitting and munching on what looked to me like wild rhubarb. After a few minutes me and another hiker, both of us needing water, scared it off or at least out of sight.

I was low on food and had planned to resupply the next day in Front Royal but decided on a whim to hitch to Luray, resupply, hitch back to the trail head and keep hiking. I tried hitching for a half hour without anyone even slowing down so decided to keep hiking and resupply tomorrow as I had originally planned. It was a steep, 900 foot climb out of the gap to the top of Pass Mountain and from there a lot of ups and downs on a ridge until Wayside Gap where I lunch at Elkwallow Wayside.

From there the trail headed up up to Compton Peak and then down a long, 1830 foot, descent to US 522; the road to Front Royal. On the way down I could see many large fields and bunches of long, red roofed building obviously part of some vast estate. When I came near the first field I found it was fenced by a old, vine covered, barb wire topped, chain link fence. I followed this fence for at least a half mile to US 522. As I got to the road a car immediately pulled over and offered me a ride to Front Royal. I took the ride and was dropped off at a local burger joint where I had lunch then headed to a grocery to resupply. Leaving the grocery an older fellow entering asked if I was a thru hiker and if I needed a ride to the trail head. On the way to the trail head we passed several numbered gates that all appeared to be part of the ""estate"" I had seen hiking in. I asked the driver about them and he told me they were all part of a US Government WWII remount center; a place where horses, thousands of them, were staged and trained before being sent to Europe and the war. He told me it was established in 1913 and was more than 5000 acres. It was still owned and operated by the US Government and used to raise horses for the army and as a equine research center. After he dropped me off I hiked another half mile or so to Mountain Home Cabin; a lovely hostel where I picked up a mail drop and spent the night.

By 10:00 the rain stopped and a soupy fog rolled in; a fog so thick it felt like I was walking through a rain forest. It was also awfully humid and the effect this had, combined with the effort of climbing mountains, was to make the sweat roll off my forehead and drip, like a leaky faucet, off the end of my nose (very annoying). The hike out of Mountain Home Cabin was a climb of 800 feet to the top of some unnamed (at least in my guidebook) mountain. From there the train descended for three miles to VA 638. After crossing the road (I am always hoping there will be trail magic at the next road but, as with today, I am usually disappointed) the trail climbed 500 feet to a large clearing with a nice bench plunked under a tree where I had lunch. Soon after that I spotted a sign, high up on a tree, informing me that the next 27 miles was, from 1863 to 1865 the western edge of Mosby's Confederacy (something you history buffs can research). From there I hiked, mostly downhill, to Dicks Dome Shelter, an older shelter with an odd shape. It was full but the occupants told me another, replacement shelter was half finished and just a couple hundred yards up a side trail. I hurried there and found a shelter with a floor, columns and tarp covered roof and just one other hiker in it. He told me a severe thunder storm with the potential of large hail was only a hour or two away. Soon three other hikers showed up and we spread out on the floor as far away from the roof overhangs as possible. We ate and hung our food bags just before the storm hit. It was bad, with lots of thunder and lightning, strong winds and heavy rain, but there was no hail.

It was also humid but not the brutal humidity of yesterday. The trail was relatively easy, at least at first, with fairly gentle rises and falls and footing that was more sandy than rocky. I was amazed that the trail was as dry as it was after last nights downpours; I guess it had been dry there for quite some time and the ground soaked up the water. That relative ease ended abruptly at about eight and a half miles when I reached what is called The Roller Coaster. This is a 14 mile section of trail with very steep and rocky climbs and steep and even rockier descents. In all I think there are 12 peaks all between 400 and 600 feet high and none have any special views; they are simply there to make this section of trail as demanding (a polite term for it) as possible. There is a warning sign at the beginning but there is no option available; if you want to do the AT you must do the Roller Coaster. It lived up to it's name and I was huffing and puffing on the first climb. After 5 or 6 climbs I was resting every 100 steps and cursing the damned thing every 200 steps. One bright spot happened on my last climb of the day, about 8 miles into the 8 1/2 I would complete today, in that I passed the 1,000 mile mark on the trail. It is noted by a smallish sign nailed to a tree that simply says ""1000"" on it. After reaching the top of the last peak of the day I had to rest for 15 minutes before walking the half mile up a very gentle slope to the Bear's Den Hostel where I planned to spend the night. Once there I signed up for the hiker's special; a bunk for the night, a shower, laundry, a 12 inch pizza, a soft drink and a pint of Ben & Jerry's for $30. And then, knowing I would need longer than overnight to recover and because I was so far behind on my journaling, I paid for another night with just the bunk and a shower for $20.

Soon after a couple of young thru hikers raced by and told me a severe thunderstorm was less than ten minutes away and they were hurrying to take cover in a shelter a mile down the trail.

I could see the shelter a hundred feet away when the rain turned to a downpour soaking me and my backpack. It rained for an hour often even harder and, when it finally ended and I started out again, the trail was muddy as hell. By late afternoon I got to a campground, set up my tent and took a shower, when the caretaker came by and told me and the other thru hikers that a pizza joint would deliver to a gate a half mile up a dirt road several of us placed an order ( a $120 order ) and three of us walked to the gate to pick it up. As we waited the skies darkened quickly and within minutes another thunder storm started dumping buckets of water on us. The delivery finally came and we carried pizza and liters of Coke, in the rain, back to the campground. It rained for two more hours forcing us to (yuk) eat in the men's bathroom since eating in our tents was not an option in bear country and nobody wanted to eat in the pouring rain. When the rain finally quit we all went to our tents. After I was asleep, about 11:00, another wicked storm hit; this time with high winds and quarter sized hail. It was almost scary worrying if my tent would shred from the hail but I must have been very tired because I fell asleep before the storm was over. At 2:00 I awoke to water on the floor of my tent. The water in the tent site (the kind with timbers around the perimeter) had filled to 3 inches of water and my tent, including my air mattress with me on it was floating in the pooled water. I found a small half inch long tear in my tent bottom that was gushing water into my tent so in the middle of the night I got to put a patch over the tear and mop up a half inch of water using my camp towel and extra shirt, underpants and socks.

Mid morning, in quick succession I crossed the Pennsylvania Turnpike, I-76, and I-81; both times people waved to me as they drove under me. By 10:00 I was soaked with sweat and wishing I could get back into the shade of the woods. At 11:00 my wish came true and I entered the woods but at the price of a climb up 750 feet to the summit of some hill or unnamed mountain. At about 1:30 I heard the booming of distant thunder and wondered if I could make it the final 6 miles to the shelter before the rain hit. I picked up my pace and was making pretty good time when I came to a very steep and very rocky 500 foot climb. After having already hiked nearly 18 miles my legs simply couldn't continue the fast pace up this hill. It seemed like it took me forever to make this climb and, all the while, the thunder got closer and the sky darker. Just as I reached the summit the rain started. I put on my pack cover and tried to hurry down the very rocky path. At first the rain felt good; it was nice and cool (I think my skin was protected by a layer of sweat) and I was actually able to pick up my pace. Then the rain turned to a downpour, the trail turned to a stream and the rocks got slippery. I had to slow down and accept the fact that I was going to get soaked. It is no fun walking a ridge line in a thunderstorm especially when the trail is terribly rocky. I nearly fell several times. The downpour lasted nearly two hours and ended only as I came to the shelter. When I got to the shelter, which was intended to sleep 8, there were 7 boys outs, a scout leader and another thru hiker already there. One of the scouts graciously gave up his bunk (really just a section of platform a little bigger than an air mattress) and moved to the floor with a couple other scouts. I was drenched and cold and starting to shiver so I stripped and dried off (as much as I could with a 12"" by 15"" camp towel) and put on dry tee shirt, underpants and socks. It was still pretty hot so I warmed quickly. With the rain stopped everyone cooked supper and ate. The other Thru hiker and I spent a couple hours answering questions and telling stories to the scouts about thru hiking then went to bed for the night.","PA-16, Boiling Springs, PA

Westy 2016,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541624,"Today I started my flip flop from Katahdin back to Duncannon, PA. Starting from the summit of Katahdin requires climbing Katahdin; the ultimate approach trail. The day started clear and a little bit cool; a perfect day for hiking. The first part of the hike was steep and aided by many rock steps and a few short switchbacks. Soon it got even steeper with lots of rocks, roots and some muddy places. After an hour or so I emerged above the tree line. The sun was bright and the views were awesome with forests and ponds far below and cliff faced mountains all around. Above the tree line it got really steep; mostly a boulder scramble that, in some places, became a technical climb. Following the white blazes was essential as it showed the route (sometimes aided by iron bars embedded in the rocks) to take. After summiting (yes-at first I thought this climb was to the summit) this section I came to a flattish area perhaps a mile across called the Tablelands strewn with boulders and large flat rocks that the trail wove through. In the distance I could see another steep pile of boulders that I assumed was the real summit of Katahdin. As I started across I noticed clouds billowing up the sides of the Tablelands from who knows how far below. They looked like a huge wave lapping at the plateau I was on. As I walked, some of the clouds spilled over onto where I was walking, but they were not thick enough to make it hard to see the trail. After crossing this I started up the boulder pile to the summit. Three or four times I thought I was there only to see another, higher summit ahead. Then I finally saw the iconic sign at the top and knew I had made it. By now the visibility was less than a hundred feet. I took pictures of the sign and the cairn and another hiker and I took pictures of each other at the sign. Then the long climb down began. It was nearly as difficult as the climb up and not made easier by the two dozen or so hikers climbing up. When I arrived at the campground Kathy noticed a walnut sized lump on my left arm between my elbow and shoulder in an area where I had had surgery in the past to bypass a clogged artery. Because of the location we were worried it was a rupture of a vein or artery or some other horrid problem. We packed up and drove off to get medical help. Several hours and multiple doctors later we were told it was probably cellulitis, given a prescription and told to return in 48 hours. So much for hiking tomorrow. We went home and had a glass of wine before heading to bed.","Katahdin

Westy 2016,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541630,"At yesterday's follow up with my doctor he agreed I could continue hiking but asked me to hike as close to home and medical help as possible. So, instead of hiking 3 plus hours from home near Katahdin I will hike near the NH border (which is much closer to home) and head north from there before coming back and heading south for Duncannon. Today's hike started in a cold, misty rain with a forecast of increasing rain and an afternoon thunderstorm. Not a great day to hike but I need to get going. The hike started with a steep, slippery climb of 2200 feet to the top of Baldpate's West peak. Besides mud there where lots of loose rocks and more than enough tree roots to contend with. Near the top, above the tree line, I had to climb a very steep, very wet and slippery and very exposed rock bald. My trekking poles were useless and my ball cap in danger of being blown from my head so they both went into my backpack. Without my cap, and despite my rain hood, I soon couldn't see through my water streaked glasses so they went in my pocket. It took a long time of carefully placed steps but I finally got to the top. Once over the summit the trail plunged 300 feet to an Arctic Bog crossed by a series of boards. It was beautiful even in the rain and I can only imagine how wonderful it would be to be there on a nice day. From there the trail ascended another 400 feet to another rocky bald at the summit of Baldpate's East peak. This was even more exposed and slippery than the previous. It required lots of hands on the rock climbing and occasionally even hands and knee crawling to get up it. At the top visibility was almost zero and it was mighty windy. I wanted to get to a lower elevation and out of the weather as quickly as possible but, instead, had to carefully inch my way down over the slippery rocks. In all, I was on the two balds for more than an hour. When I finally got back below the tree line, aided in several spots by well placed ladders, I almost welcomed the rocks and roots under my feet. At the bottom of a gap I came to Frye Notch Lean-to where I had lunch and talked to a dozen south-bounders drying out their gear. The rest of the hike was muddy and slow but not terribly difficult until the rain picked up and the wind started howling. I was drenched to the bone when I finally spotted Kathy and the Vanagon at East B Hill Road. By then my arm ached and we decided to go home and give it a day of rest before hiking again.","Grafton Notch, ME-26

By mid morning the sun broke through and the temperature rose into the 70's. It was great hiking weather. The trail started with a very gradual 1270 foot climb up Wyman Mountain. Long stretches of ponded water and ankle deep mud on the trail made the going slow and treacherous. Where the trail was not flooded it was nothing but a mix of tangled tree roots and rocks; something I guess I will have to get used to here in Maine. Half way up Wyman Mountain I stopped for a snack at a very pretty little pond; Surplus Pond. After summiting Wyman Mountain the trail dipped then climbed Hall Mountain where I had lunch at a lean-to. From here the trail plunged almost 1600 feet in less than half a mile to Sawyer Brook. The steepness and slipperiness of this descent made it particularly nasty. By the time I was at the bottom I had slipped several times, had two bloody scratches on my legs and mud on both arms and legs. After washing off the worst of the mud and applying some bandages to my scrapes I started climbing Moody Mountain. This climb was just 1300 feet but was terribly steep; even steeper than the previous descent. I packed up my trekking poles and climbed hand over hand most of the way up; often having to stop and study the next section before committing to a way up. Thank goodness there were a dozen or so well placed iron rungs at particularly steep places. At the summit I took a long (15 minute) breather before starting on the long, much more gradual and easier, descent to South Arm Road where Kathy and the Vanagon waited. We spent the night in the van in the driveway of some dear friends and neighbors summer home in nearby Bethel Maine.","East B Hill Road

The trail was starting to dry up as well with water and mud levels down enough that I could see many of the stepping stones to help cross wet spots. The trail started with a steep climb, up 2200 feet, to the summit of Old Blue Mountain. This climb was straight up in many places with no switchbacks to make it easier (come to think of it - I have seen very few switchbacks so far in Maine). There were lots of stone steps and a few iron rungs along with tree roots and rocky crevices that helped negotiate the steepest sections. The views on Old Blue (going up, at the top and going down) were simply wonderful with mountains, lakes and forests as far as I could see. The climb down from Old Blue was every bit as steep and difficult as the climb up but descended only 600 feet to a ridge that went on for six miles. The ridge was a mix of bog, steep rocky ups and downs, and muddy pools of water so that, despite having no huge climbs, the going was very slow. Half way across the ridge I summited Bemis and Bemis Second Peak; both had wonderful views of the surrounding wilderness. After these mountains the trail headed very steeply down 1400 feet to Bemis Stream. Bemis Stream was my first real ""ford"" on the AT. The stream was wide (probably 30 feet), fast and, luckily, only knee deep at the deepest. It was also the first time that it dawned on me that ""ford"" meant ""wade"" (duh...I should have known that). The crossing was tricky but not very difficult and when I was across the mud was gone from my trail runners.

The trail, for the first time in Maine (and probably quite a while before Maine) didn't start off with a tough climb; only a routine 400 foot scramble to a ten mile long ridge line. Once on the ridge the trail kind of meandered over several easy ups and downs and near five different ponds; Moxie Pond, Sabbath Day Pond, Little Swift River Pond, Chandler Mill Pond and South Pond. The ponds were all beautiful but very different from one another. A couple had small swimming beaches (I was very tempted but didn't take a dip), one was vey small and one was very large, one was surrounded by bogs and all had loons. The trail between these ponds was much easier than in the past few days with long sections where I could walk without leaping over pools of water, tripping over tangled tree roots or scrambling up slippery rock faces. There were many extended board walks over lovely (as long as you are not walking ankle deep in water through them) bogs and several climbs and descents on fairly uniform stone steps. Overall the hike was quite pleasant and had me feeling like I could survive this trail through Maine after all. When I got about a mile from the trail head I met Kathy and we walked to the van together.

The hike started with a long climb gaining more than 2500 feet; the first half gradual and the second half very, very steep. At the high point there was a 2 mile (each way) side trail to the summit of Saddleback Mountain which I passed (I had too many miles to go to be adding non AT miles and, besides, I have seen hundreds of awesome views these last three and a half months). From there the trail dove 800 feet before climbing another 600 feet to the summit of The Horn ( I suppose a saddle needs a horn ) then down another 1000 feet before ascending another 800 feet to the top of Saddleback Junior ( that made it three summits ). All of these climbs were wicked steep with lots of rock scrambling but the views made it worthwhile; they were awesome. The 2100 foot climb down from Saddleback Junior to Orbeton Stream was pretty slippery and took a long time. Orbeton Stream was another ford ( wade ) but thankfully it was only calf deep and the rocks not too slippery. Then, as if to top off a long hard day of climbing, the trail rose another 900 feet to Where the trail crossed Barmjam Road. A half mile walk down this gravel road and I caught a shuttle to a local hostel ( the road was way too bad for our van ) where I spent the night.

From there the trail followed a rocky ridge for nearly two miles before climbing another 800 feet almost straight up ( apparently Maine has decided that switchbacks add too much trail maintenance for they are rarely used here ) to the NW shoulder ( within 50 foot of the summit ) of Spaulding Mountain. After descending 400 feet I came to a large vertical slab of granite where, in 1987, a bronze plaque was placed commemorating the completion of the last section of the AT between Georgia and Maine. I hadn't realized until I read it that the trail ( then 2054 miles versus the current 2190 miles ) wasn't completed until 1937 and was built in large part by the Civilian Conservation Corps which existed from 1935 to 1939.

From here the trail dropped about 300 feet before climbing an even higher, even windier North Crocker Mountain.

From South Horn the trail dipped about 500 feet before climbing another 800 feet to Bigelow Mountain west peak at 4145 feet.

The climb down was, if anything, steeper than the climb up.

Usually when I fall I land on my back and my backpack takes the brunt of the fall but this time I fell straight down. After falling I rolled off the trail and down a couple of feet off of the rock onto some of that thick spongy moss so prevalent at these elevations.

Next the trail climbed up Third Mountain (400 feet) and down to West Chairback Pond (400 feet) before climbing Columbus Mountain (600 feet) where there were nice views and good cell phone reception (go figure-cell phone reception in the middle of nowhere). From Columbus Mountain there was a descent to Chairback Gap (400 feet) then a short climb up Chairback Mountain (200 feet) before a long descent to West Branch Pleasant River (1600 feet). Wow, exhaustion by many ups and downs. At West Branch Pleasant River, actually just before it, there was a nice unofficial tenting area (an unofficial tenting area does not have a privy) where I set up camp. After supper I snuck off to a secluded section of river and had myself a skinny dip; I had not done that since high school. I had a delightful half hour just laying in the cold, fast flowing water letting my body recover from the last several days of hiking. That night I slept well despite my sore tailbone.","Cloud Pond Lean-to

Westy 2016,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544200,"Today was another hot one; probably in the upper 80's with humidity to match. I got all packed up early and headed down the trail to realize only 2 minutes later that I had a river to forge. So off came my trail runners, put on only minutes before, and on went my Crocks. I then proceeded to make what should have been a routine crossing anything but routine by slipping and nearly taking a bath three times en route to the other side; anyone watching would have thought I was auditioning for a high wire act. From this ford across West Bank Pleasant River it was a long, steady six mile climb up 1200 feet to the base of Gulf Hagas Mountain. At this point the real fun began; another roller coaster but this one up and down four tall, steep mountains (who says there aren't any difficult mountains in the 100 mile wilderness?). First was 700 feet up to the summit of Gulf Hagas Mountain then down 200 feet before climbing 750 feet up to the top of West Peak. From West Peak it was down 300 feet before starting up 400 feet to Hay Mountain's summit and then down another 200 feet. Finally it was steeply up 650 feet to the top of White Cap Mountain; the tallest mountain in the region at 3650 feet. Oh, I forgot to mention the thunder storm that dumped a torrent of rain and two minutes of pea size hail on me when I was between West Peak and Hay Mountain. Thank goodness I wasn't on a summit when it hit or I would have had to deal with howling winds as well. At the top of White Cap the clouds had moved away and the views were marvelous. I could look back over at least a weeks worth of mountain climbing. I also had cell service up there which allowed me to call and wish my youngest daughter a happy birthday. From the top of White Cap it was a steep descent one third of the way down, nearly 650 feet, to a 100 foot wide level area where they had built Logan Brook Lean-to. The steep climb down was made much easier by stone steps that encompassed half the distance. At the lean-to the tenting was poor to worse so I stayed in the lean-to with two other hikers. They were as tired as I was so, after eating and sharing a few stories, we all retired early for the night.","West Branch Pleasant River

The trail today started halfway down White Cap Mountain so it was steeply downhill for most of the first three and a half hours until I reached the bottom. Once down I rock hopped across the East Branch of Pleasant River without incident (it is always much easier to rock hop across a river when there is nobody around to watch) then climbed up 400 feet to a nice ridge. After about 3 miles on the ridge the trail climbed steeply to the summit of Little Boardman Mountain. From here the trail gradually descends nearly 800 feet to a nice sandy beach on Crawford Pond where I rested and had lunch. From Crawford Pond to Antlers Campsite on Jo-Mary Lakeway was eleven miles of easy walking as the trail was mostly flat and nearly free of roots and rocks (I suspect it followed the long abandoned remains of a logging road). It was, by far, the best terrain for hiking so far in Maine. During one 60 minute stretch I covered more than 4 miles! I reached Antlers Campsite about 3:00, grabbed a nice tent site (in a wonderful grove of tall pines) and took a quick dip in Jo-Mary Lake. By supper time there were probably 25 hikers in the campsite and many of us cooked and ate together around a large fire ring at the edge of the lake. It really was a pretty place. At dusk everyone retreated for their tents or hammocks where we were lulled to sleep by the distant crying of loons on the lake.","Logan Brook Lean-to

But, as it turns out, the trail had many ups and down of 50 to 75 feet that do not show up on the profile; some of these were quite steep and each was a surprise. On the positive side,I did get to hike along the shore of one large lake, Nahmakanta Lake, and three very picturesque ponds, Wadleigh Pond, Crescent Pond and Murphy Pond. The trail also crossed four streams, Dick Stream (a ford), Nahmakanta Stream, Prentiss Brook and Pollywog Stream as well as board walks over several very boggy bogs. At Rainbow Stream Lean-to I pitched my tent in a large forest clearing which, by dark, had 20 or more tents spread across it. After supper a couple of us hikers checked out Rainbow Stream and were happy to find a perfect 3 foot deep pool of water with huge flat rocks at the bottom; ideal for soaking our tired and stinky bodies.

After lunch I could not resist harvesting a few of the berries and ended up having a couple of handfuls of sweet Maine blueberries for desert (yum!).

My tail bone feels about the same; it hurts most when I sit, lay on my back or take a big step up or down. The hike started with a steep, 2500 foot climb up Old Spec Mountain. Old Spec is Maine's third highest mountain and the highest point on the Mahoosuc Mountain Range. It marks the northern end of the Mahoosuc Mountains which is regarded by almost every hiker I have talked to as the most difficult section of the entire AT (oh joy!). From the top of Old Spec the trail plunges down Mahoosuc Arm; a 1600 foot drop in less than a mile and a half. Much of this descent is on long sections of exposed granite bedrock usually sloping downwards at an angle of more than 45 degrees. With either steep drops or tangled scrub brush on each side there is often no choice but to trust the treads on your shoes and walk nearly straight down these slabs. It can be plenty scary because if your foot slips you'll end up sliding uncontrolled until the next boulder or drop off which can be 20 or more feet away. Fortunately my trail runners are nearly new (just started wearing my 4th pair) and held just fine. I cannot imagine trying this in wet conditions. At the bottom of the Arm is an unofficial tenting area where I joined several other hikers for the night; most heading north. We ate together and talked about the trail. I told about the Arm and they told me about the Mahoosuc Notch which I would face tomorrow. It started sprinkling at about 7:00 which forced us all to our tents and a good, long nights rest.","Grafton Notch

Westy 2016,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545679,"This morning was chilly, probably in the 40's, and overcast. After packing up and eating breakfast I was on the trail by 6:00 and headed for Mahoosuc Notch. The Notch is a mile long jumble of medium to very large boulders that seem to follow a stream bed through a gap between two nearly vertical walls of stone. The guidebook I use calls this Notch the most difficult mile on the entire AT. When I approached the Notch it was a truly imposing sight. I sat for several minutes looking at the boulders and trying to spot the white blazes that would lead me through them. The Notch is wide enough (I'd estimate it to be between 20 and 50 foot wide in most places) that there are almost always two or more paths through a section that look viable. I decided that I would try to follow the white blazes as closely as possible and not deviate even if another path appeared easier or safer. I packed away my trekking poles (I figured they'd be useless most of the way) and got started. After only a short while I found I had to choose between climbing over a jumble of boulders and squeezing through gaps beneath them. The blazes gave me no clue which course to choose so I decided I would try to go over rather than under whenever I could. This strategy, along with carefully following the blazes, worked well for me. I had to backtrack and try another route only two times and had to take off my pack and push it through a gap in front of me only once. I also learned quickly to pay attention to the direction hikers coming north came from and, figuring that if they made it that way so could I, go in that direction. By following these rules I set for myself I made it through the mile in about an hour and twenty minutes and without a single bump, bruise or scrape. At the end of the Notch the trail rose steeply up to the summit of Fulling Mill Mountain and then down into a gap where I had lunch at Full Goose Shelter. From here the trail traversed a series of mountain peaks; Goose Eye Mountain's north, east and west peaks, Mount Carlo and Mount Success. Starting up Mount Carlo at about noon, the sky started getting dark and the winds really started blowing. I was tired from the days efforts and my tailbone hurt like the dickens. As I put my pack cover and rain jacket on I had to decide between stopping for the day at Carlo Col Shelter about a mile ahead over Mount Carlo (avoiding the bad weather and having a very long 19 mile day tomorrow) and going on six miles over Mount Success to Gentian Pond Shelter (pushing it and risking the storms today and having a more doable 13 mile day tomorrow). I decided to push on. Just as I reached the summit of Mount Success it started raining and the winds really picked up; enough so that I literally had to lean into the wind (like those talking heads on the weather channel do at hurricane sites) to stay upright. Thankfully there was no thunder nor lightning so the situation was uncomfortable but not really life threatening. I arrived at Gentian Pond Shelter at 6:00, exhausted and sore but happy with making it through a very hard 12 hour day. Most of the hikers staying wth me at the shelter were going north and wanted to know all about the Notch and the Arm so I told them over supper. Some of the other hikers went a swam in the pond after supper but I was too tired and turned in early for the night.","Mahoosic Notch North End campsite

The first three miles on the trail were easy with a shallow 600 foot climb past Dream Lake to Wocket Ledge, a, slippery, narrow, rocky ledge with good views of the Presidential Range. From here the trail dropped a thousand feet to Page Pond and the Trident Col (what the heck is a Col?) Campsite where I had lunch. I had a short day so rested here longer than usual trying to get the lead out of my legs before attacking the two mountains, Cascade Mountain and Mount Hayes, lurking just ahead of me. The climb up Cascade Mountain was rocky and very steep but the descent was mostly pine needle trail. Mount Hayes was another story with lots of rock climbing both up to the summit and back down. At the top it was so windy my trekking poles almost blew away when I put them down to take a picture. Once down Mount Hayes I had to walk on roads for seven tenths of a mile to a trailhead parking lot where I met Kathy.

Kathy and I had left our home in Topsham yesterday afternoon and spent the night in a National Forest campground so I was able to be on the trail by 8:30.

The shelter at Imp Campsite, like all shelters in New Hampshire, had a steel box to protect food from bears. This also seems to keep the numbers of mice down as they can't get into the boxes any more than the bears can.

After leaving Imp Campsite the trail headed steadily uphill to the top of North Carter Mountain then, after a short downhill, continued steeply up to the summit of Middle Carter Mountain. Luckily I was past the steepest section of this when the rain started. From Middle Carter the trail dropped to Zeta Pass before before it began a very steep climb up Mount Height (another dumb name for a mountain); a very open and exposed summit. From Mount Height the trail continued to the top of Carter Dome; also very open and exposed summit with strong, gusty winds. From here the trail dove 1600 feet in just over a mile to Carter Notch where it was protected from the wind but still very rainy. I had a late lunch under a rock overhang that kept the rain off of the top half of my body. After lunch I climbed up 1000 feet in miserable conditions to the summit of Wildcat Mountain peak A and followed a semi exposed ridge line for 3 miles over Wildcat peaks B and C to Wildcat peak D. On peak D there is an observation tower and the top of a gondola that came up from the valley below. By now I was soaked, tired and had wobbly legs and was facing what looked like a very, very steep descent to Pinkham Notch. I decided to take the Gondola down for the evening and back up tomorrow. I knew this would mess up my schedule for reaching Zealand Falls Hut where I had reservations on Saturday night but figured I would deal with that later; right now I needed a place to sleep that was not on the top of a mountain.

Half way down the skies opened up and it poured rain on me for the rest of the descent. This made the climb a nightmare with more rocky crevasses and a long series of slippery slabs of rock and the occasional uneven stone steps made for people with five foot long legs.

Once I was down I met Kathy and she brought me to the Appalachian Mountain Club Highland Center to shower before we headed for a National Forest campground for the night.

My original plan was to hike to Madison Spring Hut, 7.8 miles away, but now hoped to make up for my day lost gondola riding by hiking all the way to the summit of Mount Washington, 13.5 miles distant. The trail started off very easy with a nearly level, ""pine needle"" path for the first mile and a half. The trail then went gradually up a thousand feet to Lowes Bald Spot before continuing on with another fairly easy two miles of rolling terrain. Then, very abruptly, the trail headed very steeply up over 3000 feet in two and a half miles to the summit of Mount Madison. This climb was wicked hard with many very steep rock scrambles and dozens of boulder climbs. All of the rocks just off the trail were jagged and sharp making it impossible to find easy ""arounds"" and making a slip all the more dangerous. I put my trekking poles in my pack, took two deep breaths and started up. All of the way up the views were ""distractingly"" wonderful with views of rows of mountains stretching out for miles and miles. I had to come to a complete stop every few minutes just to look around at the beauty of it all. At the top of Mount Madison I took an extra long break and just gawked at the scenery. Not 50 feet down from the summit I caught a glimpse of Madison Spring Hut below, took a distracted step and fell. I landed hard on a bunch of rocks cutting cutting my right knee, right elbow and the palm of my right hand. My face landed hard (knocking the wind out of me hard) flush on a flat rock knocking my glasses several feet down the trail. Thank goodness the rock my face hit was flat or I am sure I would have broken something important. It was my worst fall so far and I just lay there for a while moving this and that to see what hurt. I then got up, fetched and straightened out my glasses and very carefully started down to the hut. I finally got to the hut and, when I walked in, the caretaker there immediately walked me to a bench and had me sit. I guess I looked pretty dreadful. He scurried off and came back with a glass of sugar water and a snickers bar. He sat next to me while I consumed these and we talked about my situation. It was 2:30 and I was a hard 5.7 miles from the summit of Mount Washington. He strongly discouraged me from going on and offered me a ""work for stay"" at the hut (this includes leftovers and a place on the dining room floor to sleep in return for an hour or so of chores in the morning). There were no bunks available so ""pay for stay"" way not an option. I agreed to stay, cleaned myself up and had 3 bowls of soup (they sell soup left over from the previous nights dinner to hikers for $2 a bowl). I then found an out of the way spot and rested until after the paying guests ate supper. We (me and 5 other ""work for stay"" thru hikers) then had leftovers for supper and waited for quiet hour (9:30) when the guests went to bed and we could spread out our sleep gear on the dining room flooring go to bed.

Skipping and making up sections is common among thru hikers and completely allowed by the AT Conservancy; the governing body for the AT. In fact the ATC recognizes hikers who have completed the trail and that ""issues of sequence, direction...or whether one carries a pack are not considered"".

I was not used to all those people and after only a few minutes I wished I could crawl under the table to get away from all the noise. I didn't let on that I was going through this and spent a good deal of time answering questions about being a thru hiker to the people sitting near me. These same people also seemed quite amazed the I had seconds and sometimes thirds of many of the dishes on the table (the meals are family style and I didn't take extra helpings until every one else had eaten their fill). After supper I talked to several people about thru hiking before quietly slipping off to my bunk and going to bed; I was asleep by 8:00 despite lots of noise all around me.","US-302, Crawford Notch

Westy 2016,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547457,"This morning it was cold when I awoke. The huts are not heated, at least in summer, so it is much like getting up when sleeping in a tent. We were awakened by one of the staff singing and playing Hallelujah on a guitar; a nice way to be roused. Breakfast was at 7:00 and it was good and plentiful. There was oatmeal, eggs (powdered but not bad), bacon and lots of pancakes. I had a big meal. Leaving the hut it was cool, almost cold, sunny and pretty windy (probably 25 mph gusts). There trail started off very steep with a 2300 foot climb with plenty of rock and boulder scrambles. The higher the trail rose the windier it got and by the summit of South Twin Mountain (elevation 4902 feet) it was blowing hard enough that I had to put my ball cap in my backpack to keep it from being blown away. When I got to the hut it was only 2:00 so I had a bowl of soup, selected a bunk and stretched out to rest my legs and feet until supper time. Supper was again very good and so was the company at the table although I still had a bit of trouble coping with all the people talking at once; much different than the small groups of people at shelters and tenting areas who mostly eat in silence. After supper I was cornered (in a nice way) by several people who were very interested in thru hiking. I answered their many questions as best I could all the while getting the distinct impression that some of them though being a thru hiker was totally crazy. When I could slip away I headed for my bunk and some quiet time (thanks to ear plugs) before going to sleep.","Zealand Falls Hut

Westy 2016,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547465,"Today I was again awakened by singing and guitar music, ate a big breakfast and was on the trail by 8:00. The moment I stepped out of the hut I was greeted by strong, probably 30 mph, winds, cool temperatures and gloriously bright sunshine. The trail from Galehead hut was rocky and difficult with lots of small, but annoying, ups and downs for the two and a half miles until it turned up to Mount Garfield. The climb up Mount Garfield, while only a thousand feet, was extremely steep, rocky and difficult. Up on Mount Garfield the views were excellent and, although quite windy, made for a good place to take my late morning break. From the summit of Mount Garfield the trail dropped steeply over 800 feet to a rocky ridge heading for Mount Lafayette. The climb up Mount Lafayette was wicked tough and included a 300 foot section of trail that was more rocky waterfall than trail and a very treacherous waterfall at that. When I reached the tree line, maybe close to a mile (and felt like two miles) from the summit I was in the open and subject to terrible winds. It was very rocky and cloudy up there and disability was probably less than 100 feet. If not for the cairns (piles of rock) every 30 or 40 feet it would have been impossible to follow the trail (having put my glasses in my pocket so they would not blow away didn't help my ability to find my way either). The trail was not as steep as getting to the tree line but was rocky and difficult nonetheless. It seemed like the winds got stronger every step I took until, near the summit, I had to walk in a crouch and use my trekking poles to keep from blowing over (no kidding; the ends were that strong). A couple of gusts seemed to take my breath away. I learned later that the gusts up there were up to 76 mph. I met several hikers coming down as I was going up and they all had blank stares and just just wanted to know how far down it was to the tree line. And it was cold. I had on a long sleeve pullover shirt, a down sweater and a windbreaker/rain jacket and I was still chilled. Thank goodness I had gloves or my hands would have frozen (well, maybe not, but they would have been very cold). I finally got to the summit I didn't even stop but searched for and started right down the trail to Greenleaf Hut. This descent was awful as well and it took me 30 minutes to get below the tree line and out of the worst of the wind. In all I was above tree line probably less than 90 minutes but it was a hard, scary and maybe even dangerous time. When I reached the hut there were a couple of other thru hikers who had just come from the summit and we all agreed it was an experience we would never forget. Once in the hut the whole world quieted down for me; I had some soup, found a bunk, rested and waited for supper. At supper I answered many questions about conditions at the summit that afternoon (the other thru hikers were all ""work for stay"" and not having supper with the ""pay for stay"" crowd), went to bed and slept soundly.","Galehead Hut

Westy 2016,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547473,"Today was a great day for hiking with clear blue skies, mild temperatures and little wind; a huge change from yesterday's gale force winds, thick clouds and bitter cold. The first hour of the day was spent climbing back up nearly 1000 feet to the summit of Mount Lafayette and the AT. I usually dread climbs that do not count as mileage on the AT but today's climb was an exception. I kind of enjoyed seeing the views, both close in and distant, that I had missed when I climbed down this trail yesterday encased in clouds and whipped by wind. At the summit the views were particularly stunning, maybe the best I'd had on the entire AT, with Mount Washington dominating one direction and Franconia Notch the other. I spent nearly an hour up there taking pictures and gawking at the views. From Mount Lafayette the trail crossed Franconia Ridge to Mount Lincoln then on to Little Haystack Mountain (why isn't it named after a president?). Even though very rocky and sometimes difficult, this section of trail was breathtakingly beautiful with mountain views in every direction made even more special by the crystal clear skies. From Little Haystack Mountain the trail descended 3370 feet to Franconia Notch. The overall descent today from the summit of Mount Lafayette to Franconia Notch was an incredible 3830 feet! From Franconia Notch, where I crossed under Interstate 93, it was a fairly easy climb (if any 1300 foot climb van be described as easy) up to Lonesome Lake Hut. This time when I arrived at the hut I received a special surprise; in addition to soup there was one serving of open steak sandwich (leftover steak from last nights supper on home baked bread with gravy) left that I could have instead of soup. Of course I took the sandwich and it was huge and delicious. After chowing this down I found a bunk and rested until supper. At supper I was actually too full to have seconds of anything except the cobbler then headed to bed. It had been a wonderful day.","Greenleaf Hut

I chatted with one of staff while she mixed pancake batter and cooked oatmeal. The ""stay for work"" hikers were still sound asleep in their sleeping bags on the floor but were awakened by another staffer and ushered out of the hut just before the paying guests were awakened. Breakfast was again a feast and I was full, packed and out on the trail by quarter to eight. The trail from Lonesome Lake was flat but very rocky for a mile or so then started climbing steeply up nearly 1500 feet in the next mile and a half to the summit of North Kinsman Mountain. North Kinsman Mountain at 4293 feet is number 28 (28th tallest) of the 48 four thousand footers in New Hampshire. Today I would climb two 4000 footers; North and South (number 22 at 4358 feet) Kinsman Mountains. The AT crosses 16 of the 48 four thousand footers in New Hampshire. From South Kinsman Mountain the trail descended rapidly down 2000 feet to Eliza Brook (that would be a great name for a brand of bourbon) where I refilled my water bottle and ate lunch. From there the trail gradually climbed just over 1000 feet over the course of 3 miles to the summit of Mount Wolf.

We started driving up the mountain at a little after 7:30 and the weather looked good; we could see the summit and it looked clear. Half way up we notice some wispy clouds blowing onto the summit and by three quarters of the way up the top of the mountain was in a dense cloud. We hit the cloud soon after and had to inch our way to the parking lot by the observation building. I went to the observation building to see what I could learn and when I entered I found several thru hikers huddled in a corner waiting for the van service to start up so they could get rides down. They had talked to the ranger on duty and he told him the storm had moved in early , that the barometer was dropping and that it would not be a good day to try to hike down. I spotted a hiker I had done a lot of hiking with through portions of North Carolina and Virginia and offered her a ride to the bottom. Kathy, her and I headed down (very slowly thru pea soup fog) and, at the bottom, Kathy and I decided we would head for home in Topsham for a couple of days until the weather improved.

At the top the weather was glorious with bright sunshine, clear skies and low (maybe 20 mph) winds. My friend headed north and I south. The trail down Mount Washington is very rocky with mostly basketball size rocks and occasional sloped slabs of granite. That meant careful rock hopping and slow progress. The trail was down hill most of the day with short, steep climbs only to mountain summits along the way. I crossed or passed by short side trails to Mounts Monroe, Franklin, Eisenhower, Pierce, Jackson and Webster (was there a President Webster?). From Mount Webster the trail headed down a series of steep rock scrambles followed by long stretches of narrow ledge. The ledges were only a couple of feet wide and had sheer drops to one side of hundreds of feet. This section of trail is called Webster Cliffs (you know a section of trail will be difficult when they give it a name; they do not name easy sections of trail). I am not usually bothered by heights but the drop off on the side of the ledges kind of made my stomach flop when I looked down.

The weather today is nice; overcast early but burning off to reveal clear skies by mid morning. Temperatures are in the 70's. The trail today started incredibly tough with a steep climb up along side of Beaver Brook. This is a 1700 foot climb in a mile and a quarter and another of those dreaded named trails,""The Cascades"", that are wicked difficult. The trail climbs right next to a series of steep waterfalls or cascades some so close to the trail that water spray covers the rocks and makes them very slippery. Because of the moisture many of the rocks have that slippery green stuff coating them. Thankfully there were many man made aids to climbing along the way with iron rungs, fastened diagonally cut sections of lumber that were a little like steps and rebar hand holds to grab onto. The lumber steps were old and I tested each one for sturdiness before committing my life to them. Once at the top of the cascades the trail continued to climb, although somewhat less steeply, another 1100 feet to the summit of Mount Mosilauke; the last of the NH 4000 footers I would climb. At the summit were long views of the surrounding country side; mountains behind me and high rolling hills in front of me.

Today the trail started with an 1800 foot climb up a mountain not named in my guide book or gps. At the top I came to a nicely shaded stone wall the just screamed ""take a break here"" to me. I stopped and had a protein bar and several gulps of water before continuing on. The trail now headed down hill through forest very much like the climb.

Once back up to the stone wall I continued south on a gradually rising stretch and came to The Lookout; a privately owned cabin open to hikers. It is called The Lookout because there is a ladder in the rear that leads to a lookout platform above the roof. From there the trail went up another few hundred feet to an overlook with no view (it was blocked by overgrown vegetation).

The trail from the shelter rose very steeply up 1500 feet in the next three miles (hence the warmup that made me shed the rain jacket) to the summit of Stratton Mountain. At the summit is an old, kind of rickety fire tower (with a sign at the bottom that no more than four people at a time were to climb it) that provided wonderful views of mountains in every direction. To the south was Mount Graylock, the highest peak in Massachusetts. Also on the summit, next to the fire tower, is a plaque commemorating this spot as the birthplace of the idea of an Appalachian Trail. From the summit of Stratton Mountain it was a very long 1730 foot descent to the Deerfield River and then an eight mile trek over roller coaster like terrain to the Kid Gore Shelter where I spent the night.","Stratton Pond Shelter

The trail was very walkable with sections of pine needle and dried mud pathways; very easy on my feet and brain ( not requiring constant attention to every footfall ).

From Harmon Hill the trail followed a ridge for nearly 7 miles before rising up another 700 feet to the top of Consultation Peak. From there the trail descended, very gradually, to Roaring Branch Pond. After a long break I climbed 500 feet to an unnamed hilltop before a long descent to the MA/VT border. Soon after the border I came to a blue blazed ""Bad Weather Bypass Trail"" offering a safer way to go when the weather is bad. These always mean a difficult or dangerous section of trail is ahead. Sure enough within a couple hundred feet there was a very steep ledge with no option but to trust the treads on my trail runners and walk straight down it (holding my breath the whole way).

From Silver Hill Campsite the trail headed down through rocky terrain to a dried up stream then was pretty flat for almost five miles. During this stretch the trail switched back and forth between leaf cover forest path and dirt trench through farm fields. The walk through farm fields provided nice views of the surrounding countryside but were wet from overnight dew and by the time I was through them my trail runners and socks were soaking wet. Soon after this the trail dumped out onto a little used gravel road which it followed for another mile or so. All of this relatively flat walking was enjoyable but came to an abrupt end when the trail started up to St John's Ledges (I knew by now that most named sections of trail were a going to be a challenge).

The trail then became a demonstration of the many improvements made to the trail by the CCC in the 1930's with various examples of different types of staircases, bridges, switchbacks and walking surfaces.

All this, when added to the difficult 45 minute climb back up the Vista Trail, meant we didn't get back on the AT until 11:00. The trail was a ridge walk for almost three miles with little elevation change but plenty of leaf covered, baseball sized, loose rocks. One of these loose rocks did cause me to roll my left ankle badly enough that I took a fifteen minute time out to let it rest. I have rolled both ankles a couple of times over the course of 2000 miles but this one hurt a bit more than the others. Just what I need entering NJ and PA; the rock capitals of the AT. After the time out I got up and tested my ankle and, though it hurt a bit, it was OK to walk on close to normally. Soon after I came to a vertical slab of rock,15 feet top to bottom, with iron rungs to climb down on. It was not very difficult but was about the last thing I expected to encounter here. Just after 2:00 I passed the NY/NJ border; another milestone announcing I was getting close to finishing. Another couple miles of trail brought me to the Wawayanda Shelter. When I arrived there was a section hiker just finishing his first day on the trail. We stayed together in the shelter and I spent lots of time answering his many questions about hiking the AT. I slept well despite sharing the shelter with a world class snorer.","Village Vista Train to Geenwood Lake NY

Westy 2016,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550334,"The forecast was for rain today and, when I awoke, it sure looked like it would rain any minute. The sky was very dark with clouds that looked to be full of water. It even sprinkled for a few minutes while I was eating breakfast. Then it never did rain and by mid afternoon it even started clearing up although it became real cold and the winds picked up. My ankle was sore but not too painful when I started hiking. The trail continued along a bumpy, rocky ledge the three miles to the summit of Wawayanda Mountain. The climb down the south side of Wawayanda Mountain is called The Stairway To Heaven. It is a steep, rocky descent of nearly 1000 feet that was made much more difficult by the two two dozen or so day hikers trying to climb it while I was going down. At the bottom the ground really flattened out with almost a mile of boardwalk over a large swampy area. These boardwalks were, like the others over the last couple of days, very treacherous to walk on. After crossing the swamp and a couple more miles of hilly pastures the trail climbed 750 feet up Pochuck Mountain then across a mile long ridge before coming to Pochuck Mountain Shelter. This was a nice shelter with wonderful views but the water source, and I needed water, was a half mile down a steep hill; not much fun at the end of the day. There were no level tent sites so I stayed in the shelter for the night.","Wawayanda Shelter

The rains stopped just before I started hiking and didn't start again all day even though it remained overcast. After leaving the shelter I started down the same steep hill that I struggled with yesterday to get water. Once all the way down the trail flattened out considerably. I walked nearly a half mile on a boardwalk through a swampy area and then more than a mile on a ""rail trail"" like walkway through the Willkill Wildlife Preserve where I saw absolutely no wildlife. After leaving the wildlife preserve the trail climbed over a small forested hill before crossing another mile long swampy area; this one on a fancy boardwalk with handrails and viewing benches. I stopped at the last bench and had lunch before taking the trail into the forest and climbing a long, nearly 6 mile, gradual slope up 900 feet to High Point State Park. Once in the park the trail came to a wooden observation deck with a nice view of a 220 foot tall obelisk, built in 1930 as a war memorial, that sits on the highest point in NJ. After taking a photo from this deck I hiked a half mile to the park headquarters building where I waited for a shuttle to Mosey's Hostel. I planned to stay one, maybe two nights at her Hostel to clean up, do laundry, journal and sleep in a real bed (well, at least a real bunk). After eating supper at a local pizza joint I journaled until 8:30 or so then went to bunk.","Pochuck Mountain Shelter

After a big pancake breakfast the hostel shuttle gave two of us a ride to the trailhead at the High Point State Park Headquarters building for an 8:00 start. Us two hikers were going in opposite direction so we said our goodbyes and started down the trail. It was still cold and I was wearing nearly everything I had with me. The trail followed a rugged ridgeline for the first seven miles, while slowly shedding layers of clothing, before it started climbing to the summit of Sunrise Mountain. The rocks on the trail seem to get worse every mile; I guess they are working there way up to what they will be like in PA. At the top of Sunrise Mountain there was a parking area with picnic tables and a great view of the surrounding countryside. I had a late lunch at the picnic table and answered lots of question about through hiking as people came to take in the view.

By mid morning the sun was shining and it warmed up a little so that it was a great day for hiking. The trail was hilly but not steep; the primary challenge was the rocks. On the way up Rattlesnake Mountain I met a foursome coming down and they had to tell me all about the huge rattlesnake they had seen sunning itself on rocks near the summit. I was glad they like snakes and thought the sighting was the highlight of their day hike but I am not a snake lover and knowing there was a ""huge"" rattlesnake ahead certainly slowed me down as I neared the top of the mountain. There were rocks everywhere so until I was well down the other side I was constantly on the lookout trying to avoid a close encounter. It urns out I never saw the rattler but couldn't shake the feeling there was one under every rock until well after lunch. The hunt for snakes and the horrible rocks combined to make the hike slow going. I was happy when I found the unofficial tent site (a fairly large flat area with a fire ring that had obviously seen a lot of use). I was also happy it was pretty much rock free and very shady; no great need to fixate on snakes here. I set up my tent, ate supper, hung my bear bag and was ready for bed by 6:00. As the sun set I got into my sleeping bag to stay warm and was sound asleep before, maybe well before, 7:00.","Gren Anderson Shelter

Westy 2016,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550963,"Today was cool and damp when I got up and stayed that way the rest of the day. After lunch it rained pretty heavily for a couple of hours and the rest of the day the wind blowing water from the tree leaves made it feel like it was sprinkling. About mid morning I took a snack break and had started down a little hill on a grassy section of trail when my toe caught on a root or rock or something and sent me flying through the air, pretty much face first, and crashing to the ground. I was just able to get my right hand out to break my fall (my legs were way behind the rest of me) but my face still hit hard enough to bend my glasses frame and knock out both of the lenses. The pain in my right hand was immediate. It was the same pain as a fall a couple weeks ago but seemed much worse. I rolled to my back and cried for several minutes before even looking at the damage I had done. When I peeked at my hand there was blood all over it. I had bent the fingers on my right hand back toward my wrist when I tried to block the fall. The blood was coming from the base of my index finger, at the joint to my palm, where the skin had ripped open. It was a minor cut but looked terrible. I managed to get a bandana wrapped around it, found my mangled glasses and popped out lenses and staggered to my feet; still whimpering a little I am sure. I took three ibuprofen and started hiking. When I got to the summit of Kittatinny Mountain maybe an hour later I met two day hikers who were doing a hawk watch. I guess I was pretty sorry looking because they offered me a seat and some food and water. I sat down and told them about my fall. They pulled out a first aid kit and cleaned and bandaged my hand for me. One of them then gave me a bagel with cream cheese and a coldish can of Coke. What a treat! I pulled out my glasses and they managed to straighten them pretty much and popped the lenses back in. We talked awhile, I thanked them and started hiking again. From Kittatinny Mountain it was a long, slow (I was being very careful and couldn't hold onto my right trekking pole) hike, past Sunfish Pond and the Kittatinny Visitor Center and across Interstate 80 to the town of Delaware Water Gap just over the NJ/PA border. I headed immediately for a local pizza joint where I got a dinner sized portion of baked ziti and a couple bottles of cold beer (the cold felt good against my hurting hand and I held it there while I waited for my dinner). After eating I ordered a sub to go and headed for the bakery next door and ordered several muffins and sweet rolls to go: my supper and tomorrow's breakfast. I then went up the street to The Church Of The Mountain Hiker Center hostel where I got a bunk for the night. When I got there I was happy to discover that two of the other hikers there were guys I had hiked with quite a lot and they helped me unpack (my right hand was hurting too much to use) and get my shoes and socks off in preparation for showering. After I showered and dressed I called Kathy and told her about my fall. I told her I was pretty sure nothing was broken but was afraid I couldn't set up my tent one handed; meaning I would have to hike from town to town and stay in either hotels or hostels for a while (there are no shelters in this section of PA). She informed me she would be down to meet me tomorrow; her car was already nearly all packed and she'd leave early the next morning and we would figure out together what to do next. After I hung up I chatted with the other hikers for a while, ate my sub (they were going across the street to a restaurant with live jazz music and I wasn't up to joining them) and went to bed. I had a rough night with my hurting hand but managed to get a pretty good nights sleep.","Unofficial Tent Site

I ate my muffins, packed up (the other hikers in the bunkhouse helped a lot with this as well as tied my shoes for me) and I was on the trail before 8:00. It was cool but the skies were bright blue and the sun was shining. The trail was still wet from yesterdays rain and probably some rain overnight but not at all muddy. I started up a long, steep at first but then gradual climb, up nearly 1200 feet, to the top of Mount Minsi. I found that I was able to use my right trekking pole by using only the wrist strap and my thumb to hold on. After getting to the top I followed a long, bumpy but nearly level, ridge for most of the rest of the day. I passed many overlooks with wonderful views of the rolling countrysides with trees nearly at their peak of fall colors and patchworks of farmland stretching out as far as I could see. The rocks, however, were horrible to walk on. It was impossible to develop any kind of rhythm when each step had to be selected and the almost ankle depth leaves hiding many of the smaller rocks did not make it any easier. Just after lunch I called Kathy and we decided to meet at PA-33 near Wind Gap, PA. About a mile before PA-33 Kathy met me on the trail and, after she checked out my hand, we walked to the car (the vanagon transmission was still being rebuilt) together. From the trailhead parking area we headed to a local restaurant and then a nearby hotel where we spent the night.","Delaware Water Gap, PA

After a big breakfast we headed to the trailhead and I started hiking before 7:30. The trail started with a gradual climb, up about 500 feet, to Hahn's Overlook and then a fourteen mile long ridge with steep drop-offs on one or both sids for much of the way. Although the ridge was fairly flat it was still a slow, hard hike because of the horrible rocks. There were half mile long sections of trail where I never saw the ground; they were covered by every conceivable kind of rock. There was gravel, softball sized loose rock, beachball sized boulders and slabs of broken and unbroken rock at all different angles. All this rock made for slow going and it took me until nearly 5:00 to get to Little Gap Road where Kathy met me. She had started to hike to me me but was soon deterred by the rocks and waited at the car instead. Once to the car we headed to a local dairy bar for i large cup of ice cream for me and then to a local restaurant where we had dinner. We spent the night in a nearby hotel.","PA-33 Wind Gap

I am now able to partially clench my fist and can wiggle all my fingers without much pain at all so I am pretty sure that nothing is broken and that my hand will eventually heal and get back to normal. The weather this morning was cold and very overcast but would clear by mid morning and warm to the mid 70's. After a big breakfast (hotels with complimentary breakfasts must lose money on thru hikers) we were off to the trail. The climb out of Little Gap Road was only 400 foot of elevation change but slow because of the loose, slippery gravel. Once I worked my way up the initial hill the trail followed a really bumpy path for about four miles before descending nearly 1000 feet to the Lehigh River where I had lunch with Kathy. After eating I climbed out of the river valley, up more than 1000 feet, to a ridge that went right over the Lehigh Valley Tunnel that the Penn Turnpike passes through. This section of trail may have the worst rocks in PA which is really saying something. After crossing over the tunnel the trail continued past Bake Oven Knob, Bear Rocks and Knife Edge before coming to PA-309 near the summit of Blue Mountain. Here Kathy picked me up and drove me to a nearby ice cream bar where I had a huge milkshake and she had a small cup of ice cream. We like these so much we decided to stay for supper (and, for me, another milkshake).

After another big complimentary breakfast we headed for the trailhead and I was hiking by 7:30. From Blue Mountain Summit the trail followed a fairly level ridge for more than 8 miles to an overlook called Dan's Pulpit then continued to Hawk Mountain. While on this ridge I was constantly bothered by some very persistent and extremely noisy mosquitoes that seemed to really like dive bombing straight into my ears. I guess the warm humid weather had woken them up and they were hungry. After swatting at them for the better part of an hour I finally had to resort to bug spray to keep them off of me. After Hawk Mountain the trail descended nearly 800 feet to Panther Creek where I found a nice flat rock where I ate lunch.

After breakfast we headed for the trail and I was hiking by 7:30. The climb from Hawk Mountain Road was a long but gradual and rocky accent of almost 800 feet in just over two and a half hours to a blue blazed side trail to a rocky outcrop called The Pinnacle. I rarely do blue blazed trails any more but I had heard so much from other hikers about this outcrop that I decided to take the quarter mile side trail to see what all the hullabaloo was about. It turns out that this was a pretty cool chunk of rock with steep cliff to the east that gave perfect views of miles of farmland below. After The Pinnacle the trail continued on to Pulpit Rock, another nice view point, and then dropped 600 feet to Furnace Creek. The trail then climbed up and down a couple of small but steep and rocky hills before taking a steep descent to Blue Mountain Road. When I got to this road there were a bunch of bikers taking a break there and we talked about hiking versus riding and the hot and humid weather before they mounted up and roared off. I wandered around in the parking area for a while looking for the white blazes south that I should follow but didn't see any. I checked Guthooks, my trail/GPS software, and headed where I thought it was sending me. After walking a quarter mile on Blue Mountain Road I spotted the trail 50 or 60 feet to my left down a very steep embankment. Rather than backtrack and find the trail to the trail I dumbly decided to climb down the embankment to get to the trail. The embankment turned out to be very loose ash like dirt into which I sunk in up to my shins after only a couple of steps. But once I started down there was no turning back as I slid nearly half way down before I realized this wasn't going to be very pretty. I was quickly heading for a wide ditch at the bottom that looked like it was filled with a wet version of the ash like soil I was sliding through when I managed to grab onto a sapling growing almost by itself. This helped me stop my slide and I was able to slowly make my way to the edge of the ditch without falling. I jumped the ditch and was soon on the trail; glad there was nobody around to witness the dumb descent I had just made.

The hotel we stayed at started serving breakfast at 6:00 so we were able to get off to an early start. I was on the trail by 7:15. The hike out of Port Clinton started with a short road walk and crossing some railroad tracks before heading up a very steep, 1000 feet in less than a mile, and rocky hill to the top of a ridge. My right hand was still hurting so I couldn't efficiently use my trekking poles to help me up this climb. This, along with lots of leaf covered rocks, made the climb the most difficult in quite a while. At the top I passed a sign informing me I was hiking in state game lands so it wasn't surprising that I occasionally heard gun fire in the distance. I was wearing a bright orange vest so I was not too terribly worried that a hunter would mistake me for a deer. Just after lunch I heard a loud clanking noise ahead and when I caught up to it found it was a strange looking backpacker crawling on his hands and knees. He was an older fellow with a strangely beard and wearing an WW-I vintage external frame, canvas rucksack, an oversized rubberized poncho and rubber boots that came up to his knees. He was crawling along picking up something. I said hello and he whipped around as though he hadn't seen another person in days and gave me a big, friendly grin. I asked what he was collecting and he told me he was picking up acorns from the trail so hikers didn't come along and squash them. He said he spent most fall days picking up acorns and saving them so he could scatter them in the woods come the first snowfall. I told him I thought that was a great idea, wished him well and hurried ahead. Compared to this encounter the rest of the day was pretty uneventful and, with the nice weather and the easy, except for the rocks, trail I was able to cover a lot of ground.

I was excited about reaching Swatara Gap today as I had more than once been told that once I crossed that gap the numbers and difficulty of the rocks on the trail would go down significantly. That was something to get excited about. A mile before Swatara Gap the trail dove almost 1000 feet and passed under Interstate 81, the last interstate highway I would cross on this journey, then across the Swatara River Bridge into Swatara State Park. The trail through the park was well groomed and did indeed have few rocks; hopeful indications for the trail ahead.

By noon it there were high winds and pouring rain; not a very fun day to be on the trail. It was one of those days when there were not many road crossings so, despite the rotten weather, I was forced to cover over fifteen miles on the trail then another mile and a half on a side trail, The Victoria Trail, to get to a road crossing. The day started with a long climb, up more than 900 feet to the summit of Second Mountain with views of thick clouds in every direction. From there I descended 600 feet to a footbridge over Stony Creek before following a gravel road for a quarter mile to a bridge over Rousch Creek. Here the trail flattened out a bit and became extremely rocky. Then the wind and the rain hit. It came with a vengeance; more like an ocean squall than a forest storm. The trail quickly became a river through the rocks and increasingly thick piles of leaves. I was feeling a little sorry for myself until I remembered that I was within twenty miles of completing the trail. With that in mind I thought to myself that this storm, certainly not the worse I had encountered over the last seven months, was not going to stop me. I trudged on for the next 8 or 9 miles; slipping on wet leaves and stumbling on unseen rocks until, finally, I reached the trail crossing for the Victoria Trail; one of many side trails in the area and one that led to a road where Kathy was meeting me. The Victoria Trail was poorly marked and, with all the leaves, hard to follow. A couple of times I had to stop and wander around (in the rain) to figure out which way to go. Soon, however I could hear the cars on the highway I was approaching and that helped a lot.

It took me half an hour on the Victoria Trail to reach the AT but, for the first mile on the trail, I was rewarded with some easy hiking over relatively flat terrain. Then the trail turned difficult with a couple of miles of hilly, rocky, wet leaf covered ground. Late in the morning I met Kathy at a road crossing and we had a snack together. From here I crossed a footbridge over PA-225 and the trail suddenly became an order of magnitude harder with lots of hopping over large randomly sloped slabs of rock and occasional steep, boulder scrambles up and down steep sections of trail. Every now and then I came to an outcrop of rock with a view down a thousand feet to the Susquehanna River valley where I knew my ultimate destination of Duncannon was waiting. Once I finally completed crossing these very difficult rocks the trail headed steeply down, thankfully via many switchbacks, to the river valley below. When I reached the bottom I abruptly emerged from forest to civilization. I crossed Clarks Ferry Bridge over the Susquehanna River then the Juanita River Bridge before heading into Duncannon. The last mile was through a mostly residential area with Halloween decorations everywhere. This was in stark contrast to the trail. As I approached the Doyle and the end of my journey Kathy joined me and we walked together. At the Doyle, after taking some photos, Kathy and I went inside for a pint of beer and a big lunch.
