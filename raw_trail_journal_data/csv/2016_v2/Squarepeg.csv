Squarepeg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523688,"As I write this, one year ago today I was on an Amtrak Train to Gainesville, Georgia to the Hiker Hostel to begin my Thru-hike adventure. I said that I wanted to hike again on Facebook and was contacted with an interesting offer. Not long ago I was asked by So Way from the Hiker Trash Maintenance group to join their efforts on the trail as a part of their Ambassadorship program. During my hike last year I had received so much love and help that I wanted to give back to the trail and the hiking community. I saw this as a great opportunity and after some questions, joined the group. I will be headed to Springer and while I hike my duties will entail firepit maintenance,(I will clean out firepits, pick up trash, encourage others to pitch in and practice LNT principles. We want to counter the influence of some people on the trail that act rude and entitled and others who are drunkenly disrespecting their fellow hikers, trail angels and trail services. We want everyone to know that thru-hikers are a great and giving community that is grateful for our support system on the trail.To find out more or ""volunteer as Tribute"" to the Hiker Trash Trail Maintenance program contact So Way on Facebook or the group. We are working on setting up ways for our representatives to receive ""trail magic"" through the great organization - Zero Day Resupply who has already made a contribution to my donation page at their site. You can make donations at the following link...https://www.zerodayresupply.com/donation.php?x=756&y=crazydave0866%40gmail.comI am so eager to get back on the trail among my trail family and surrounded by trail angels and nature's beauty. I am recovering well from my shoulder surgery on December 10th to reattach my left shoulder rotator cuff. I have gone through physical therapy for the injury that I received before the Dragon's Tooth in Virginia which almost lead to me getting off of the trail. It was the agony and the ecstasy, but I was able to overcome and finish my thru-hike. Part of this was because of Niki Rellion - AKA The Bionic Woman who I met early on in my hike. She had her leg amputated 18 months before she hit the trail and had to overcome physical, mental and mechanical difficulties to finish her thru-hike. Hanging out with her, some of her stubbornness and determination rubbed of on me and anytime it got tough I would think of her spunk, mentally slap myself, man up and hike on. I will carry that same drive to reach Katahdin this year and wonder what kind of adventure that the trail holds in store for me. So, once again I am asking you to buckle up, keep all of your body parts in the vehicle and join me for the ride. Thanks to all who followed my adventures last year and supported and encouraged me on my thru-hike. No rain, no pain, no Maine! So to Katahdin I go!","

Squarepeg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554373,"My trip to Springer mountain was a long and exhilarating one along the narrow road. The ride brought back a flood of memories and I was constantly carried back to my adventure last year. The hike was a pleasant one and I arrived at the Hawk mountain shelter, cleaned out the firepit and swept out the shelter as a part of my duties as a Hiker Trash Trail Maintenance Ambassador. I set up some Firestarter materials around the restored firepit for a fire later. The shelter was empty but there were two hiker's in his tent and one setting up his hammock as his shelter. I talked to Alex, Lew, Ben, Mike, Melissia and Bones arrived and found their tent and shelter spots. I made dinner and relaxed for a while talking to the other hikers. Later I was asked if I wanted to share anything and it began a question and answer session that ended up lasting an hour or more about my experience from my last thru-hike. Then everyone went for dinner. Everything is going well at the shelter and we are all safe and well.","I volunteer as Tribute!! :)

Squarepeg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554375,"I was up at 6:00 and on the trail by 7:00. Everyone was still sleeping when I left the Hawk Mountain Shelter. Today was a challenging day with lots of ups and downs. I still have my trail legs but have lost the stamina that I had due to the inactivity after my surgery in December. The trail is all familiar and went fast and I made the 7.7 miles in just five hours. Someone had packed out a pellet rifle to the shelter and then abandoned it there as it was very heavy. Someone tried it out and it still worked. We pondered why someone would bring something so heavy on their hike. The following hiker's are at the shelter including , Mike, Melissa, Gaines and his father Brad. Kenneth is the resident Ridgerunner. The weather is beautiful and the temperature is perfect. The conditions and weather was better than both of my past two hikes where it was raining both times and the shelter was full. Last year I actually cleared and leveled a spot under the shelter with a rock and slept there, safe and dry. My back has been giving me hell today and I had to partake in a safety meeting to deal with the pain. Today I had to take one and a half of my Oxycontin which helps and I only use it only when I can't go on. I'm stretching and drinking plenty of water. I'm having a great time and it's great to be back on the trail! At the shelter I cleaned up up and rebuilt the firepit, picked up trash and swept out the shelter. I took my first shower in the stream using my 3 liter platypus and then I washed the sweat out of my clothes. I'm resting and will soon be making dinner. I was inspired and wrote a letter to my fellow thru-hikers trying to encourage them. Thanks for reading and encouraging me in my hike. Squarepeg","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Squarepeg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554378,"I didn't carry a bear canister so I decided to make the 15 mile jump from Gooch to Neel Gap. There was an average of 4,000 foot of ascent and descent along the way making it a very challenging day of hiking. The stonework of Blood Mountain amazed me as before as it challenged me physically. I felt good but tired and tight as I stretched, showered, ate and relaxed. I had found a stash of trash before Woods Hole pass and packed it out. It was nice to see that the trash situation is much better this year than last and I had to pick up a lot less. I've found very little on the trail. I stayed at the Hostel and got a few items at the store and did laundry. I'm taking a break tomorrow before Tetnassee Gap and when I leave the day after I'm planning to stay at the second shelter in the gap. It's great to be back on the trail! Sunny and cool weather to hike in is great.","Gooch Mountian Shelter

Squarepeg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554383,I was up early from my good nights sleep in the hostel and went to the store next door for some breakfast and to pick up some supplies. I went over to the Blood Mountain Cabins where I rented a cabin and left note that I was willing to spit the cabin with up to 3 other hikers. I did laundry and just rested for the day taking a walk to the outfitter in the afternoon. I sat on the patio and rested for some time before retiring for the night.,"Neel Gap

Squarepeg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554385,"While hiking up to the Whitley Gap Shelter I got off to a late start and got turned around about 1.5 miles from Tetnassee Gap. Sat down for a few minutes, dozed off, and when I woke up I walked 1 mile or so in the wrong direction, much to my frustration. I had to turn around and cover that ground again adding 2 miles to the day. The climb after Tetnassee gap was as tough as I remember the past two times I hiked it, but the views were incredible. It was getting late so I decided to go to the Whitley gap shelter as it was only 1.2 miles off trail as opposed to 4.8 to the next shelter. There are many flowers blooming along the way today, poking through the dead growth from last year. I saw my first rock cairn today. It looked well done so I took a picture. The views today are amazing and I remember how much I loved Georgia. There's a nice bonfire at the shelter and I had a hiker box dinner of a homemade rice dinner to which I added Garlic Sriracha Seasoning, olive oil and real bacon pieces and a cup of coffee. Getting ready for bed.","Blood Mountain Cabins

Squarepeg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554387,"I hiked to the Blue Mountain Shelter and hiked 26,880 steps -according to S-Health from Samsung. I gained 3,600' and lost 3,200' of elevation today. It was a beautiful day of wonderful views and I'm making good progress. I picked up some trash at the shelter and along the trail. The last two firepits have been in good condition so I left them alone. I'm hiking well, I take a lot of breaks during the day, especially going uphills. I feel my stamina returning as time goes on and I hike forth. I been listening to my music and The Swiss Family Robinson on audio books -unabridged. I got a little sunburned today when I wasn't paying attention. As soon as I noticed a change I dropped my pack and applied some sunblock which helped. I found out that the Top of Georgia Hostel doesn't pick up at Unicoi Gap anymore. They shuttled here last year to the Hostel for free if you stayed at the Hostel. I may take a zero there and resupply in town. I ran into Chuck Wagon, a hiker that I met last year on my thru-hike at Stratton Pond. It was good to see a familiar face at the shelter. Some thoughtless person had actually thrown an orange pack cover in the privy. I got settled in the shelter after visiting for awhile before going to sleep.","Whitney Gap Shelter

Squarepeg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554388,"We were up early and ate breakfast at the restaurant down the street. We caught the shuttle back to Unicoi Gap where we had been picked up. I slack packed with Bigfoot - the Barefoot hiker and we hiked 16.7 miles from Unicoi Gap to Dick's Creek Gap and arrived one half an hour early for the shuttle back. We gained a total of 5,500' and descended a total of 5,800' on the rugged and winding trail. Hiking with Bigfoot was cool, He hiked 17 miles barefooted. Our speed was similar although we both go slow on hills. He goes fast uphills while I go up in granny gear and pick up speed on flats and downhills. I did laundry and picked and while resupplying at the grocery store, I picked up some Toblerone chocolate bars and Bigfoot and I had one. He'd never had them before and loved it . I'm ready to enter North Carolina and my second state. I remember that the climb into North Carolina was pretty brutal as it was long.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Squarepeg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554389,"From the Blue Mountain Shelter I descended to the Unicoi Gap where I ran into a shuttle to the Budget Inn in Hiawassee, GA. I took my first zero and am going to be slack packing from Unicoi to Dick's Creek Gap tomorrow. It's been dry and there are several fires burning along the trail northward from my location. I went to the Ingles grocery store for some resupply. I got 2 packages of Blazing Buffalo & Bleu Cheese Combos and 2 of pepperoni for dinners. I grabbed some oatmeal, bacon pieces Idaho instant mashed potatoes along with fruit snacks, beef jerky and granola bars. I found someone named Bigfoot to split the cost of the room that night. Bigfoot was hiking the Appalachian trail barefooted, which is quite an ambitious endeavor. I saw my fellow Texan there sharing a room with some other hikers and having a few beers.","Blue Mountain Shelter
