Trainer52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538449,"4/30 - 5/1/2016 Rt.55 to Bull's Bridge. First overnight on the trail! The plan was to start at Rt.55 and hike 10 miles to Mt. Algo Shelter. A mile into the hike, I realized that I was not in good enough shape to cover the 10 miles. It was my first time carrying a 29 lb. pack and my legs were trying to handle the load. Up-hills were much slower than I could go at age 15...go figure! So, I adjusted and hiked to Ten Mile shelter for a rest stop. Hiked out to Bull's Bridge and got lunch at the grocery store out on Rt. 7. Back to the shelter and set up the tent for the night. Was joined at the shelter by Iris, who was section hiking SOBO. We had a good talk about hiking and life in general. It stormed that night, but I stayed nice and dry in my tent. Up at 7 the next morning and hiked back to my start.Lessons learned: First time out was harder than I expected, 50 year layoff makes a big difference, but going back was relatively easier, so I can do this!Thankful for: Gail, for her support of my quest; Trail Journals, where much can be learned through others' experiences.","Rt. 55 Gaylordsville, CT

Trainer52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539478,"May 20-22 Mt. Algo Shelter to Stewart Hollow Brook ShelterI left Friday after work and drove to Kent, then short hiked to Mt. Algo Shelter.I tented Friday night along with a couple of section hikers (Sunshine and Billy). I left some trail magic in a cooler on the trail (Gatorade, oranges and oreo’s). I will try to do this on my section hikes! Saturday morning hiked back down to the road and gave Sunshine a ride into town. Back on the trail and I hiked 7.5 miles to the next shelter. I had some great views on Caleb’s Peak and passed through the recent forest fire area. From the top of St. John’s Ledges, the trail leads down 90 stone steps. It was steep in places and slippery with leaves. I took it very carefully, as one fall and it could be all over. Got down safely and continued on a flat trail along the river.                Met Billy, who was hiking along with three others. (Dave, Tom and T-Rex). They met on the trail a few years ago and section hike together for two weeks twice a year. Set up my tent at the shelter. It had rained some Saturday night and I was leery of hiking back up the steps to return to my truck. Another group of section hikers came into camp and I was talking to them. They had lived for a while in my hometown, Torrington. They mentioned that they were hiking back to their car a few miles down the trail tomorrow morning. I managed to arrange a ride from them back to my truck! Stopped in Kent for coffee and met a through hiked from Quebec, Biscuit. I gave him a ride back to the trail and headed home.Lessons Learned: adjusting pack items – what to bring and what to leave home; getting good advice from other hikers; legs felt better – adjusted pack for better comfort – doubled my mileage!Thankful for: Being healthy enough to do what I like, Trail magic to give back to others, Gail’s joy in my successes.","Mt.

Trainer52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539479,"June 10-12 Salisbury to Cornwall Bridge (SOBO)Friday morning I left my truck at Cornwall Bridge and placed more Trail Magic (Gatorade, oranges, cookies and candy on the trail. My cousin Craig gave me a ride to the trail in Salisbury. I was so excited to start hiking that I took off northbound. After about 1/4 mile, I realized it and reversed. I had a steep climb out of Salisbury, which got the lungs pumping and legs burning. I met Otis, who has been through hiking since January 1! My plan was to go 6 miles to a shelter and then hike 10 miles on Saturday to the next one. With rain forecast for Saturday, I decided to push the ten miles today. Had an awesome rest stop and Rand’s View, a filed overlooking the eastern hills. I crossed the new Iron Bridge in Falls Village and followed the trail along a road. It was hot and drained my energy. It made for a slow climb the last ¾ mile to the campsite. I made it and was proud of my first 10-mile day! Belter’s Campsite was peaceful and I was able to sleep without the tent fly. Trees blocked the view of the stars. I had upgraded my sleeping pad (third one) to a REI Air Rail and I was great. I will gladly sacrifice a bit of weight for comfort. It was very quiet in the woods, except for the freight train that found it necessary to blow the whistle every 10 seconds along the valley. Most interesting was the open-air privy – no walls of roof! Saw lots of birds and chipmunks, but little else of forest animals.Up at 5:30 Saturday and on the trail by 6:30. I would only need to go 6 miles today to beat the rain, which was to start late afternoon. The trail went along a ridge parallel to Lime Rock Race Track, where the road of the cars was heard for miles. Hang Glider View provided a peek at the racetrack, along with a view of the western hills. Downhill took me through Lemon Squeeze, which was not as narrow as I thought. I was able to get through without removing my pack. At 10:30, the rain began to fall. I got to Pine Swamp Shelter in an hour, just before the skies opened up. Six of us sat watching the rain. After a couple of hours, the rain let up and the other hikers continued their hike. Since I had the place to myself, it was a good time for a nap! I woke to sunshine! Later, three other hikers would stay at the shelter: Cous-Cous form Germany, Michael form Ireland and Grey Hauser, form down South. Cous-Cous was up early Sunday, so I decided to head our also and enjoy the beautiful morning. Mountain Laurel was blooming and birds were happily singing. I had my first fall, nothing serious, just a few scrapes. It took me a while to figure out how to get out from under my pack. The trail continued over Pine Knob, pine needles and a nice view. I had hiked there many years ago with my son, Jeff. I met a couple who were through hiking (Clothesline and ??) who commented on how nice the trail was maintained in CT. From the end of the trail, I had about a mile hike back to my truck.Lessons Learned: Planning is the most important part; know when to adjust your itinerary; stop to enjoy the views; do not forget the powdered coffee creamer!Thankful for: Gail’s encouragement (she will plan to hike with me at times); other hikers I meet along the trail.","Rt. 41 Salisbury

Parked on Schaghticoke Road and left trail magic across the street.
Walked about a half mile down road, past a small pond, to the trail.
Weather was cloudy, with a breeze, good for hiking.
Black flies buzzing around, but grew fewer as I climbed higher.
Began a steep climb to top of Schaghticoke Mtn. nice view east from rocks at the top
Met a father and son who were section hiking.
After a very brief rain shower, sun came out and began to bake the trail.
The trail continued down and around, hugging a steep slope at Indian Rocks. More good views.
Headed down a long boulder path, bottoming out in a peaceful valley. Woods were very quiet.
Another long hard climb up Mt. Algo. Tripped on a root and felt a pull in right calf…no lasting pain.
Another rocky descent, three miles to the shelter took almost 2.5 hours.
Finally, the shelter was in site. Caught up with the father/son hikers.
Had a great conversation with a through hiker (never did get his name).
Was planning a night camping at the shelter. Heat, bugs and low running stream made me rethink my plan.
Severe t'storms were forecast for the afternoon, so decided to hike out to Rt. 341, then take dirt road back to the truck.
Ended up gifting him some of my food, as I was heading back home.
I passed another through hiker on the way out who was very thankful for the trail magic.
He had filtered some water on the trail and it did not taste good. Gatorade to the rescue!
Arrived at the truck just as thunder and rain began. Perfect timing!
After last year's struggle in the White Mtns. paying more attention to decision making and staying safe!","Bulls Bridge

Trainer52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550873,"5.	August 12-13 - Mass into CT
I was trying to finish out the CT section by hiking SOBO from the AT Conservancy Center in South Egremont, MA to Rt. 41, Undermountain Road in Salisbury. Gail had followed me Friday afternoon so I could leave my car in Salisbury, and dropped me off at the trail 11 miles up the road. Heading into the trail along a field, I heard thunder rumbling. It continued for the next hour, but the storm stayed north of where I was. The trail up to Jug End was very steep, with many switchbacks. Since I chose a day with 100 o temps and high humidity, I was climbing pretty slowly. Once on top, I followed the ridgeline, and then headed downhill toward the Glen Brook Shelter.
About a half hour from the shelter, the rain caught up with me. Since I was sweating profusely, I decided to forego my raincoat and enjoy the shower. I had also given up on wearing my glasses as they continually fogged up. It added a bit of fun as the woods were beginning to get darker. As I reached the shelter cut off trail, it began to pour. I found my way over to a tent platform and set up my tent during a lull in the rain. There was no way to do it without some water getting inside, but I was able to use my hiking towel to mop up most of the water. After cooking my freeze-dried lasagna dinner and cleaning up, I settled into my tent. I slept to a gentle rain most of the night. Up at 5:45, filtered some water, then I packed up the wet items into my pack. It was a nice 700’ climb up Mt. Everett with beautiful views from the top ridge.
I took time to call Gail (she was worried, as I had no cell coverage yesterday to let her know I arrived at the shelter) and then lingered, totally enjoying the view! Here I made a decision to cut my hike short, skipping the next two mountains, and head down a side trail back to my truck. The hike down Mt. Everett was one of the steepest I have seen, mostly on rocks, which were a bit slick from last night’s rain. Even though I was very careful, I managed to fall twice. The first time was into a small soft bush, while the second time was against rocks. Fortunately, I only suffered a scrape on my arm. The big challenge was to get back up with the 30-pound pack on my back. I finally made it to Race Brook Falls trail, which took me 2 miles back to Rt. 41. One small problem here – my truck was parked 7 miles south! As I started walking, I decided to stash my pack in the woods so my road walk would be easier. I did try hitchhiking, but no one even slowed down for me! After 4.5 miles, I came upon another trail parking area and was fortunate to have a family from Hamden give me a ride 2.5 miles to my truck! Bless them!
Lesson Learned: 1. Always listen to your body, hike at your own pace, and make good decisions. Cutting the hike short was the right thing to do. 2. Plan your exit trail closer to the truck!
Thankful for: hiking strength, cooling showers, mountain top views, and Gail’s concern for my well-being.","AT Conservancy Center

Trainer52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550874,"6.        September 10-11 Riga, Lion’s Head, Bear Mtn. and Sages RavinePlanned better to start and stop hike at Undermountain trail on Rt.41. Easy going up Under Mountain trail to reach the AT. It was very hot and humid. Following the AT south, it was an easy, flat hike to Riga Shelter. Awesome views out to the east!Originally set up tent, but moved back into shelter as rains were approaching. I did not want to deal with a wet tent the following night. I met up with Larissa, who was on her first overnight hike. We had some good discussions on hiking, equipment, dehydrating food and training.After a quiet peaceful night, I headed back out to Bear Mtn. It started to rain as I passed Brassie Brook Shelter, so I stopped in to wait out the storm. At the shelter was a dad hiking with his two daughters and a section hiker. I enjoyed more good conversations on life and hiking! The storm passed within an hour and I changed my plan to include climbing up Bear Mtn. It was less than a mile to the summit and despite the dark clouds, rain and wind, offered some good views. As the front was passing, the temps dropped about 20 degrees, so I did not linger at the top. Instead of continuing down the steep, slippery north side, I headed back down south and I took the Paradise Trail to reconnect with the AT north of Bear Mtn. Along the way, I managed to roll my right ankle three times! Fortunately, I was able to hike without a lot of pain. A short downhill placed me at Sages Ravine Campsite. I originally had planned to camp there overnight, but had a feeling that it would be better if I cut the weekend short and hiked back out to my truck. Between my ankle and the bear warning signs, I think I made the right decision. I will return there another time! I made good time on my hike out, covering 3.2 miles in 2 hours! Lessons Learned: After rolling your ankle once, try not to do it two more times! Pack an ace bandage next trip in case. Always adjust your hiking plan to weather and health.Thankful for: Gail calling to check on my ankle; Beautiful views; meeting hikers and having good conversations; not hearing my ankle snap or pop!","Rt. 41, Undermountain Road

Trainer52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550875,"7.        October 13 Plan B: Cornwall Bridge to Stewart Hollow ShelterPlan A was to drive to Mt. Washington lot in MA and hike to Laurel Ridge campsite. After setting up camp, I would slack pack to Mt. Race and back. However, Mt. Washington Road was closed due to bridge repair; I turned to plan B and decided to complete my CT section from Cornwall Bridge south. Arriving at the lot at 9:30, I hiked up and over Breadloaf Mtn., crossed Route 4 and continued over Silver Hill toward the Housatonic River. The trail leveled along the river and passed through a series of fields that are “maintained to maintain pastoral, historic settings” along the trail. I passed by many stone walls, and I always wonder who the families were that lived here and farmed the area. I think of times when I was having a tough day, it must have been tough every day for them! Puts things in perspective. From the size of the trees in the former fields, I gathered that it was a long time ago when these were active. I remember reading that 200 years ago that Connecticut was 70% farmland; today it is 70% forest. I reached Stewart Hollow Shelter around 12:30. Originally, I was making this an overnight hike, but the afternoon forecast was for rain. I did a quick calculation and figured that I could hike back to my truck in a couple of hours. I relaxed for a while, had lunch, and hit the trail. At 2:30, I was back at the truck, just as it started to rain.Lessons Learned: Always have a backup plan and check for road construction before the trip. I could have slack-packed this and saved myself from carrying 30 pounds for 10 miles!Thankful for: The peace and tranquility of the trail while hiking on a weekday; the joy in Gail’s voice when I told her that I was heading home early!","Cornwall Bridge
