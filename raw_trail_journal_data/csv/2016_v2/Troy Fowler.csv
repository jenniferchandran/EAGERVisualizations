Troy Fowler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539928,"When I set my starting date for 6/28 it seemed like it was so far off in the distance. But here I am, wide awake at 2am writing this first journal entry the night before heading up to Katahdin and Baxter State Park to begin my SOBO thru hike of the AT. I've been mentally preparing for a long time and the fact that my journey actually begins tomorrow still hasn't fully hit me. I will be adding a gear list when I can, but as I am new to online journal entries it may take me a bit to fully get the grasp of how to work this site. Couldn't be more excited for tomorrow, Katahdin here I come!",,Today's the day!,"Jun 28, Tue",0
Troy Fowler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541507,"We left Abol Campground before 7:00a to go pick up day packs from the Katahdin Stream Campground ranger's office. We also had to register as long distance hikers, which basically meant we were given a receipt to put in a box once we left BSP, just so they could make sure we had left the area. The ranger, Ed, informed us about the weather conditions which we had noted, 70% chance of thunderstorms all day but looking pretty decent at the moment. He suggested bringing at least 2L of water, good hiking boots, and good rain gear. Bearing that in mind I filled my borrowed LL Bean day pack with 3L of water, (what I thought was) plenty of food for the day, an extra layer, gloves, my hiking poles, and rain pants and coat. We signed the register at the beginning of the Hunt Trail at 7:35a. It was raining when we started and we wore rain gear from the beginning. We hiked in solitude for a long time before running into other people, who were coming down the mountain. They had turned around at the tree line due to the weather forecast. We crossed another couple groups who said the same thing. Not much visibility up top, so you wouldn't be able to tell if a storm was coming in, much less when or how bad it would be. Almost at the treeline, three girls came barreling down the trail toward us. They said someone in their camp group had been seriously injured and they were going to get help. Less than 10 minutes later we arrived upon the scene of the injury. We didn't know exactly what had happened, only that the girl was very lucky there was a former ER doctor hiking close behind her. We heard whisperings of a big cut on the patient's leg as they perused our med kits for anything that could be of use. When there wasn't much left for us to do to help, so we decided to continue on to Baxter Peak despite the impending weather. We reached the highest point in Maine and unfortunately saw no views. Visibility was maybe 75 feet, so we quickly refueled on some food and took the obligatory picture with the Katahdin sign, then began our descent as cold winds and rain began to pelt us.When we reached the area where the girl had been injured before, there was no one there. A bit further down the trail we ran across the group, now joined by ranger Ed, who had managed to move the injured girl to the other side of some very tall rocks. I still can't exactly figure out how they did that. The section where she fell started with a metal monkey bar you needed to pull yourself up on, followed by a metal rung as a foot/hand holder, and a few more rungs in other difficult spots. They had managed to get her past all of these obstacles, which isn't much for a total distance, but must have taken a lot of effort. When we came up to the group they recognized us as having stopped earlier. They asked if we would be willing to help if we could, and we said of course. It was then that we found out what actually happened. The girls had just passed the monkey bars section and decided to turn around due to the weather. When they were coming back down, they used one of the metal rungs as a foot hold to step down (probably a 4 or 5 feet in the air) onto flat land. The last one to go down, one of the leaders, slipped and gashed her upper thigh on the protruding metal. Apparently she literally hung on the rung by her leg until her friends could pull her off. But there was no major damage, only a nasty 10 inch cut. We had two options of getting her down the mountain: Evac by helicopter or litter carry her for about three miles down a mountain that's difficult to hike on a normal day. When I heard the blades whirring all I thought of was how crazy it would be to watch them airlift her off of the cliff she was on. But because of the shitty weather the chopper could only get up to 2,200 feet. We were then resigned to litter carrying her down the mountain in the rain. A litter carry basically works like this: Patient is strapped to a litter (stretcher.) 6 people at a time have a hold of the litter. They keep their feet planted, and pass it down the line and down the mountain. When you let go of the litter you say ""off"", and peel around to the bottom of the line to catch and pass the next time through. We started with I think 15 or 18 people including the girl campers. As we moved down the mountain more Rangers and BSP employees joined us until we were over 45 strong. We began the litter carry around 2:30p and didn't reach the bottom until 8:30, cold, wet, hungry, and exhausted. We stayed around for some free food and a post-rescue meeting among all who participated. Thankfully through the whole ordeal Ed, the guy we spoke with in the morning and the lead ranger on the mountain rescue had gotten us a spot at Katahdin Stream Campground, closer to the start of the AT so we wouldn't have to hitch a ride again the next morning.The Rangers said they only do 4-5 rescues each year, making it pretty crazy that we happened to be a part of one. I'm hiking the AT looking for some life experience, so hopefully what I gained from that litter carry on day 1 is a good sign for what's to come.","Abol Campground

Troy Fowler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541513,"After Katahdin, an 9.9 mile stretch separated us from the 100 Mile Wilderness, the most remote section on the entire trail. We hiked that in a day and camped at Abol Pines campsite. We awoke in the morning to a beautiful view of Katahdin and a deer grazing across the pond from us. 
The 100 Mile Wilderness
It took us 9 days to hike the 100 Mile Wilderness. Coming into this hike I planned on starting slowly and building up to bigger miles, and we definitely worked at that the past 9 days. 
For the first week it was beautiful weather, then it rained for the first time since Katahdin on Thursday and it was miserable. We saw some beautiful lakes and summited some fun mountains with awesome views. Stealth camped at Mountain View Pond where I slept without the fly on my tent--I've had a cold ever since. Not making that mistake again. The best view we saw was from atop Third Mountain, where we camped Wednesday night (7/6.) It was a spot called Monument Ledges and the landscape continued wider than the corners of our vision. We watched some insane weather roll past us, and were rewarded for sticking through it with the brightest and closest rainbow I've ever seen. 
40 miles into the Wilderness we met my parents at Jo Mary Road for a resupply of food and some well needed pizza, fruit, and drinks. A lot of people we came across didn't have this resupply, and therefore carried 10+ days of food through the wilderness, while we only carried 5 or 6. Unfortunately, Brett decided to get off the trail at this point. He had a rash that was continuously growing on his thighs and other parts of his body, and headed home to get that taken care of. He is planning on meeting back up with us again in the near future. 
Thursday the 6th was the roughest day of the trail so far for me. First, we only did 9ish miles because of how wet and slow going things were. Second, I slipped at one point and snapped one of my hiking poles in half. Before that point I had been beyond happy I paid for the nice ones, as other poles I'd seen had problems staying locked out, and collapsed without warning. Still need to figure out how to move forward with that problem. I strapped the broken pole to my bag for the time being. Later in the day I put my pack down to set up my tent, and rrrrrrip! I nicked my rain pants on the broken end of the pole and ripped an inch long hole in them. I was pissed. Everything was so wet and I did my best to dry it in my tent as we slept. I read somewhere that if you sleep with your wet clothes in your sleeping bag it dries them out. I've tried it every night so far and although it has yet to completely work, I do feel that it probably helps in the drying process. 
At the end of every day I feel exhausted, but only one day so far have I felt like I was at my max for miles. And that day I am positive that I didn't eat anywhere close to enough to make up for all the calories I'm burning. Still really need to work on that. 
Nights are basically reserved for playing cards and binge eating. When we can get cell service it's always a bonus. We go to bed early and wake up moderately early, and are definitely getting better at doing so. Tonight we are staying at Shaw's Hiker Hostel in Monson. It came highly recommended by thru hikers handbook and many hikers along the way. Supposed to be rainy the next couple days. Definitely hasn't disappointed. We were greeted with a PBR and a tour of the place. Trying to figure out if we are taking a zero tomorrow or pushing through the rain.
