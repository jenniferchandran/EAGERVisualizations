Dulcigirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521616,"In 2 weeks, I should be on the trail or at least working my way towards getting there. This past weekend I was able to make a trial run at Woody Gap and try out the gear. It was great meeting other hikers and 3 of them were beginning their 2,189 mile trek on Sunday. It was exciting meeting other thru hikers and knowing one day soon, I will be on my way. I have to admit though, hiking with my 20 lb. pack over the weekend, reminded me of those grueling ""ups and downs"" of the GA mountains. Ugh. I'm going to be taking it slow in the beginning. That's for sure!","

I don't want to be one of those and push myself too hard, too fast. So we will see.","

When the Jackson Progress Argus (our local newspaper) asked me if they could do an article, I did not hesitate. Thank you Sherri Ellington for writing the article!! Hopefully this will encourage others to consider hiking, even if done one section at a time. Section hiking the AT can be very powerful and fulfilling...thru hiking is not for everyone!

I actually physically felt good on the trail the past 4 days. I can tell I'm getting more acclamated to the conditions, particularly the ups and downs. I still do not care for the cold. But recognize it is part of the journey. However, if conditions are extremely rough, no apologies here...I will get off the trail if I can. Many thru hikers will say the same. But sometimes we must endure. We may not have a choice. We had a rain storm come thru thru a couple of nights ago, and my tent did very well. There are others who got quite soaked.

Dulcigirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525949,"    I am 165.9 miles into the hike and now headed into the Great Smokey Mountains...unbelievable. It seems like I've been on the trail for months, but it will only be 3 weeks this Sunday. The past few days of hiking I have experienced what it's like hiking during a ""controlled burn"" of thousands of acres of the National Forest. With the smoke everywhere, ashes falling on your head, and one young man having an anxiety attack thinking the woods were on fire, made this day one to be remembered. Soon into the smoke, I met up with a Forest Service man who shared with me the information regarding the control burn and told me that all was o.k.    The next day of hiking was my first day of hiking for several hours in a rainstorm. I was drenched by the time I got to the shelter last night...The Fontana Dam Shelter (aka. Fontana Hilton). Last night was the first time I slept in the shelter...usually I pitch my tent. I have to admit, I enjoyed not having to set up my tent.    The friendships continue to build and the support of other hikers is really unique. Every day I see hikers that I have met along the way. I have been hiking the past few days with Tic and Berkley (German Shepherd), Rob, and Candyman.   I have also seen quite a few young people hiking in their small groups. It's been a joy sitting around the campfire listening to these college age kids converse. They are having a great time. So many past thru hikers are hiking again this year. I learn something everyday from these people. They are so willing to help, offer encouragement, and keep me informed on upcoming hikes. As we all continue to get to know each other, we start looking out for each other. One of the college kids came down with a stomach virus. Many of us were asking about him and concerned...he had to stay back at a shelter. Then we found out that Sparkles and Diligent came upon the shelter for the night. We knew then he would be ok. Sparkles and Diligent are a couple my age aiming to thru hike and are super people.Soon I will blog regarding the spiritual walk.... God is there always.Blessings to you all!!Dulcigirl","Fontana Dam

About a week ago, I reverted back to my traditional trail name of ""dulcigirl"", just because...well, it just seemed to flow easier when I would introduce myself. Well...over the course of this week, the hiker friends started calling me ""dulci"" for short, so that's what it seems to be now. Because I changed the trail name on my profile, it may have confused the direct link that I gave all of you previously. Sorry about that...didn't think about that when I changed it on the blog.Secondly, please overlook the grammatical errors, run-on sentences, etc!

Dulcigirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526646,"I went into the Great Smokey Mountains on Saturday with a bang! I left Fontana Dam Shelter that morning and began the incline....and I do mean, incline. That day, the majority of the hike was ascending to the high altitude of the smokies. The winds began to build and by that evening, the winds were gusting at 20-30 miles per hour and dipped below freezing that night. The shelter was full when I arrived to Mollies Ridge Shelter so up went the tent. I was very thankful mine held good thru the night. Other hikers were not so furtunate. Some of them had tents pulled up from the stakes. And some hikers forgot to sleep with their water filters and their filters froze! That's not good...not having a water filter on the trail is a bad situation! The next day of hiking was tough with the ups and downs...but weather was nicer. When I came on to Rocky Top mountain, I wanted to started singing ""Rocky Top""!! I loved ""good ole' rocky top!!"" The 3rd full day in the Smokies, I hiked over Silers Bald and then on to the highest point of the AT...Clingmans Dome. Again, it was a hard day of hiking, but exciting. Though I feel my body getting stronger for sure, the Smokies has been more challenging because of the increased pack weight due to more food and winter gear (around 30+ lbs now), the higher altitudes (I need an oxygen tank!!), and the colder weather. 30 more miles and I will be through the Smokies. Though bad weather is expected for the weekend, I will press on and will look forward to warmer weather. Meanwhile, I will enjoy my zero day in Gatlinburg, TN today!!Dulci","Newfound Gap, TN

Dulcigirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526863,"207.1 miles... that's how far I have hiked at this time. I have not hiked alone....God has been there every step of the way. Let me share an example of how I know God is there.On Thursday, March 24th, a rainstorm had been predicted for that afternoon around 2:00 PM. Around that time, I was still quite a few miles from the next campsite. The winds began to blow, the skies got darker and darker, and it was evident the storm was coming. I began to pray and consistently talk with God the next couple of hours...asking often for the rain to be held off until I had my tent pitched. I talked and meditated about many other things during that time as well, but the request regarding the rain was mentioned often, I must admit. I finally got to the campsite at 4:30 and immediately began setting up camp. The winds were gusting and the skies were dark just about that entire walk. The moment I had the tent completely ready to go and my gear inside, the raindrops started. Within seconds, it was pouring..but I was safe and dry inside the tent. Now some may say, ""that was just a coincidence"". No, that was God. Needless to say, I had my own little praise time in that tent, but I truly believe He answered my prayer that day. I recognize that He could have said ""no"" and allowed the rain to come sooner, but He didn't. This particular afternoon with God....talking to Him as I was walking to the campsite and the fellowship time with Him in the tent when it was raining...gave me such incredible strength and hope.""Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the Lord.""

I stayed at the Laughing Heart Hostel Friday and Saturday evening. The hostel prepared a hot dog hiker feed one evening. The town had vendors, games, live music, and lots of good hanging out time with other hikers. The creator of the AT Board Game was at the festival. That Saturday evening we had a huge yard rendition of the game out on the lawn. Tie and Ron were excellent host and managers at the Hostel. I continue to meet so many hikers and constantly run into other hikers I've met over the weeks.The past few days of hiking included LOTS of uphill climbs and maneuvering over rocks and boulders. It mentioned in our AT Guide book that there was a bypass trail because this section was ""rough and strenuous"". Well,....I had to do it. It took me forever to go 1.4 miles! I was climbing rocks, boulders, squeezing through places, etc. It was crazy! But I had to do it. Ha! This was yesterday. I started hiking at 8:30 Am and didn't get to my next campsite till 7:00 PM It was only 13 miles but I felt like I had done 16 or 17!! After 9 miles today, I stopped at a Hiker Paradise Hostel to resupply, charge my phone (that never has service, Ha!), and blog. The Hostel owner just cooked up the best hamburgers. :-)   And yesterday while on the trail, a couple greeted me with homemade bread!! I ate that for dinner last night and some this morning for breakfast. God is good!!! If all goes as planned, I'll be in Irwin, TN this Friday...and then on to Damascus, VA.

The hiking has been going so well too over the past 4-5 days. But no worries...I will trek on.  I may have to slow it down a bit, but that is OK.

The terrain was still somewhat hilly and rocky, but much easier than the past few days of hiking. With the rest and additional food in the body :-), I was able to press on yesterday to Waynesboro, VA...about 20 miles. When I got to Rockfish Gap, there was a list for hikers to call of people willing to come pick you up and take you to Waynesboro (about a 5 mile drive). Trail Angel, Tom ""Southerner"" Brown came and picked me up and took me to Waynesboro. He even drove around the town giving me a very thorough guide to the various places of interest (i.e. library, YMCA (for a shower.. Yeah!), Post Office, tenting area, and the all you can eat Chinese Buffet (oh yes!). This town is very hiker friendly. We don't always have that kind of friendliness in the towns we visit.As I was hiking yesterday, I came across several bears. There was one in particular that was quite interesting. He was hiking the AT SOBO (southbound). As I was going NOBO, we both came within 25 to 30 feet of each other on the trail. He was completely undeterred about me being there. I suggested he ""hike his own hike"" off the AT in a calm voice. It didn't phase him. My vocal and body gestures got louder, and I clanged the trek poles more aggressively. Still nonchalant, He started eating some grass but still blocking my way on the trail. Another hiker came up behind me and was very loud and authoritative. He finally moseyed off the trail. This was the 2nd incident with a bear in which he had no fear of my presence. I never felt afraid of the bear, but was cautious. The bear never acted aggressive either. I just thought this was interesting and unusual. Most of the time, the bears will run the other direction when they see humans. These bears have become comfortable with our presence and no longer feel threatened. When they realize we are carrying food in our packs, then it could really get interesting!I head into the Shenandoah Valley tomorrow!

The mountains were easier, the views different, different terrain, and lots of camp stores and food options to provide a relief from the normal daily trail food. I was averaging from 18 to 22 miles a day and life was good. I especially loved the wildlife. I loved all the deer, the bears, etc. Unfortunately, the hike took a different turn on Sunday morning, 4 AM on June 19th. I was tenting near the Pinnacles Picnic Area (mile 936)when I was awakened by a horrible pain in my back. Fortunately near by, another hiker was tenting who had a car. He took me to Page Memorial Hospital ER in Luray, VA - the closest hospital. The doctor confirmed it was a kidney stone, prescribed pain medicine and I was on my way to hiking again. I took Sunday off and rested at a local hotel. By Tuesday, June 21st, my conditioned worsened and was shuttled back to the ER. The stone had blocked my kidney causing kidney and liver failure and septic shock. Page Memorial sent me via ambulance to Sentara Rockingham Memorial Hospital (45 minutes away to Harrisburg, VA). I was in ICU for 2 days and then a med/surge floor for 3 days. I was one very sick hiker. Family was able to come and be with me during those difficult days. It was a long 2 day ride back to GA after being discharged on Sunday, June 26th. I am slowly recovering, but daily getting stronger. I met with my Doctor today, who is an avid hiker and plans to hike the PCT some day, who believes I can finish the hike..but only after 2 to 3 weeks of proper rest and recovery. The CAT scan shows I have 2 kidneys full of stones, so I will have to be careful, but life goes on and with God's blessings, the hike will continue. Thank you to all of you who have been praying. Katelyn and Isaac (my daughter and son) tried to contact and keep family and friends updated, but the amount of calls and texts were overwhelming. Thank you, thank you for all of you who were concerned and praying. Through out the entire ordeal, I could feel God's presence and knew that I was in His care. The fervent prayers of the Saints...God is so good. I had already planned to come to GA for the Peachtree Road Race on the 4th - a family tradition.

I am also aware that at some point I may have to flip flop to the North, but I am OK with that as well. Flip Flopping simply means I may have to get to Maine before it closes for the winter and begin hiking south.

I have several options on how to accomplish the flip flop so I will keep everyone posted as I decide the course to take.

Of course, the end of the hike, whether NOBO, SOBO, or Flip Flopper, is when the hiker must make it completely official. The Harpers Ferry registration is only for the logged miles thus far. But this is still an exciting time for the hikers. I am so glad my sons (Jeremiah and Isaac) were able to be here all week to help me get started back on the hike. They left for home (GA) last night and I am staying at the Teahorse Hostel for a couple of days to allow a pulled muscle to recover.

Jeremiah had his fiddle and Isaac had his guitar, so we played just like the old days (except I was a little rusty!). I used some of my paracord and made a strap. After the boys left, I carried the dulcimer with me when I went into town in case an opportunity arose to play. One of those times I came across an elderly lady sitting at a park picnic table. She was waiting on her son and his wife to finish a day hike. It didn't take me long to realize she had some dementia and was struggling with general conversation.

I have so much to share, I don't know where to start! On a positive note, I am continuing to get stronger and my body is beginning to adjust to the pack again. Shoulders, hips, legs, and back are all better. My feet still need some work.  However overall, physically it is getting easier. The past week has been extremely difficult mentally. Getting back into the groove physically, missing the hiking community I knew (they are 300+ miles ahead now), missing the kids after being with them for 3 weeks, the HEAT, HUMIDITY, AND BUGS, etc. has made it tough to keep going. Now I understand the mental challenge piece of the hike. Getting to the halfway point sign at 1094 miles was not exciting to me. I'm ONLY HALFWAY!!! I've still have 1094 miles to go!!!! That's what was going through my mind. So to get myself to stay on the trail, I began remembering how excited I was about going back to the trail and finishing the journey. I had MANY conversations with myself and God to sort through the rambling thoughts and frustrations. I watched a group of young people (Zena, Counselor, The Girl, and Sticks) having fun as they hiked...jumping in lakes, pools, doing the half gallon icecream challenge, etc. And I thought about The Real Deal coming through the campground with trail magic and words of encouragement. I remembered meeting Iceman and his wife at Harpers Ferry and the trail angel work he was doing for myself and several other hikers. Regathering my thoughts and remembering the positives has been the key, but still very difficult. I knew that in spite of the ordeal with the kidney stones, this journey was not over and that has not changed. We may not always understand the hills and the valleys in our lives, but we must still go on. I have been an Elijah these past couple of weeks and I needed to ""tell my heart to beat again"". On the way back to the trail I listened to a message from Pastor Joe (thank you Shirley for sending the CD) having no idea how this message would be so apprapo for me back on the trail.

Thruhikers are sometimes allowed to stay at the hut for the evening for a work-for-stay. The thruhiker assists with cleanup after the guests have had dinner and with whatever work the caregiver deems helpful. If there are leftovers after dinner, the thruhiker is able to enjoy a good hot meal. The thruhiker also gets to enjoy sleeping inside for the night.

I actually had fun through some of it only because 2 hiker friends, Dolly and Farmer, came and hiked that section with me. It was great having them there. The HUGE boulders were all a jumbled mess in a ravine, like going through an obstacle course. Sometimes I had to take my pack off to get over or under or between the rocks. The mountains in Maine continue to be difficult with straight up and down climbs, sometimes on slabs of rock where a hiker has to hang on to trees and roots to keep from falling or slipping. So needless to say, my hiking pace has significantly decreased since I've been in these states. However, I had been told it would and so I'm OK with it. I am very careful with the footing. I do not want any injuries! Cell service continues to be an issue so again, it might be a while before I can blog again. I am doing well and still hiking!","

I have not seen a moose but I am really hoping I get to see one before I leave Maine! There is evidence of their presence...lots of droppings along the path. I had 2 pine martens run across my path while in the White Mountains. Pine martens are in the weasel family and look a lot like ferrets with a head like a fox. I had never heard or seen such a critter till I came to NH. I love the wildlife and seeing other animals native to these regions.","

Dulcigirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548017,"1548.4 Miles completed as of today! I am in Stratton, ME and there is only 188 miles until I am finished with Maine. If all goes as planned (which can be altered in a matter of seconds!), I will be hiking in the ""100 mile wilderness"" some time next week. That would also mean that I could possibly be climbing Mt. Katahdin the following week (3rd week this month). Yeah!!! Over the past week of hiking, it has been tiring, but good. I have had the opportunity to resupply often and get cleaned up at hostels in various trail towns. In Gorham,NH, I stayed at the White Mountains Hostel. It is a beautiful, older home transformed into a wonderful hiker environment. After hiking 5 days of the most difficult section of the AT, I was able to arrive in Andover, ME and stay at the Pine Ellis Hostel. This was a time, again, where my faith was challenged. I was completely out of food and concerned about getting a hitch into town for resupply. As He has this entire journey, God provided. I could share with you so many times where God continues to show His presence. It is so awesome. From Andover, ME, I hiked on for a few more days until I arrived at the Farmhouse Inn/Hostel in Rangeley, ME. Once again, I enjoyed some good hot food (not trail food!), clean body and clothes, and a very comfortable bed at night. Though these mountains are tough, the towns nearby are a delight and rejuvenating! I am presently at the Stratton Motel/Hostel in Stratton, ME. My pace is beginning to increase because the terrain is gradually getting less difficult, though I am certainly not ""out of the woods"" yet (pun intended!). Maine has a beauty all on its own. I love the ruggedness of the mountains, the trails, etc. Yet, when I came to the Poplar Ridge Lean-to, it was somewhat surreal. This was the last lean-to ""inchworm"" spent the night in last year when she was thru-hiking. She had hiked on the following day and ventured off the trail to take care of personal business. Unfortunately, she became confused and was unable to find her way back to the AT. Though a complete search and rescue followed for days after her disappearance, her body was not found until this summer. It is extremely easy to get ""turned around"" out in the woods. My heart goes out to her friends and family. In a few days, I hope to be in Caratunk, ME to resupply if needed, and then on to Monson, ME. Monson is the town just before going into the ""100 mile wilderness"". I will definitely be resupplying there! So, I continue on, one step at a time, and anticipating the climb to Katahdin!!","

Dulcigirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548322,"The past few days of hiking have been super. Other than going over the Bigelow Mountains on a cold, windy, foggy day, the other 2 days were awesome. I had beautiful views, easier terrain, and some wonderful trail magic. There were a group of hikers at the East Flagstaff Road who provided hamburgers, hotdogs, desserts, and more. They have been providing trail magic every September since 1997 or 1998. They were very friendly and enjoyed hearing the hiker stories. When I got to the West Carry Pond Lean-to, there were tubs of home cooked goodies. A lady who lives on the other side of the pond canoes over to the lean-to with her trail magic. The next day I hiked to the Pierce Pond Lean-to. After setting up camp, I enjoyed the sun and the water. The next morning, I went to Harrison's for the Pancake Breakfast and then hiked to the ferry ride and on to the Caratunk Hostel. Life is Great!! I am enjoying it while I can....the 100 Mile wilderness is around the corner!! These past few days have me spoiled. Tomorrow it is back to the real world of AT Hiking!","

Once I am through the wilderness, I will be very close to hiking into Baxter State Park and climbing Katahdin. After hiking through New Hampshire and now, the last stretch of Maine, I'm excited about getting to Katahdin. The hikers around me are just as excited so I'm sure we are feeding off of each other's anticipation of the wilderness and the summit! I have seen Back Scratcher and Can Do a lot over the past week. They started the trail on March 14, a day after I started. The past 4 or 5 days, I have hiked with Gibby. He and his wife live in Louisiana and you would guess it from his awesome southern accent. Gibby is finishing his last section hike of the AT when he summits Katahdin. I am staying at Shaws Hostel in Monson and I am looking forward to a great breakfast tomorrow morning before I go on the trail! Gibby, Can Do, Backscratcher, Rock City, and I have worked out a food drop with Shaws to be delivered on Sunday. We were all concerned how we would carry enough food for the 100 miles. Problem is now solved. Yeah!! We all resupplied for 7 to 8 days of food and left half of our food in containers that will be brought to us on Sunday. I have very little cell service in the area. Thankfully, I can at least update with the blog with the WiFi! Thanks Tic, for the information. I'm hoping we can stay at the antlers campsite. Prayer Warriors, keep praying for safety and good health as we enter into the last part of Maine. Thank you!!","

Dulcigirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549403,"1,736.6 miles completed!!! It's getting closer to the end and the hardest section of the trail has been hiked!!!! I am so ready and energized to finish this trail.  The wilderness was awesome, difficult, amazing, challenging, and absolutely beautiful. I had to ford a river (but only one! Yeah!) and maneuver around rocks and roots like much of the AT requires. The views of the mountains, ponds, lakes, and waterfalls were breathtaking. The first 3 days were the most difficult with the constant ups and downs. However, on the 6th day, we emerged into Abol Bridge Campground by 2 PM and the 7th day we were at the Birches Lean-tos in Katahdin Stream Campground by 1:30 PM. On the 8th day, Thursday, September 22nd, we hiked Mount Katahdin!! Prior to getting into the wilderness, a small group of us had become hiking buddies and would find ourselves in the same camps, hostels, etc. We began keeping up with each other and actually looking forward to going into the wilderness and to Katahdin together. Gibby and I continued to hike together throughout the miles as well. He was such a great hiking buddy and good friend. The others in our group had their hiking buddies as well and we all pretty much ended up with the same mileage goals for the day, etc. Abol Bridge Campground, which is right outside of the wilderness, was very much appreciated!! We enjoyed the hot food, showers, and laundry more than ever!!! The next morning, we had breakfast at the restaurant and began the hike to Katahdin Stream Campground. That afternoon, we met at the Birches Lean-to and had the best time ever around the campfire telling AT stories. The next morning, the entire camp was up at 4 AM and hiking to Katahdin by 5 AM! Gibby and I got to the summit around 8:50 AM. Some of the group was already there cheering us on as we approached the top. Eventually all of our group was at the top and a group picture was taken. What an unbelievably powerful moment it was being on Mount Katahdin. For some, it was very overwhelming. For me, it was both reflective and exhilarating. I am so thankful I completed NH and ME, had trail friends to share the exciting end of the hardest section of the trail, and had good health before the summit of Katahdin. Gibby and I opted to hike down the Abol Trail on the way back to the campground. Because of this, we got back before the others. It was great greeting everyone as they came down the mountain. Brother and Sister's parents came to celebrate with snacks, subs, and drinks. So we had a great celebration in the picnic area at the bottom of the mountain! What a great way to end such a special day!! Many of us caught the afternoon shuttle to the AT Hostel in Millinocket to clean up and prepare for our continued hikes or next adventures. In Millinocket, Gibby, Rock City, and I furthered our celebration at a nice restaurant. The lobster was fantastic!  The next day, I was on a shuttle to Medway and then a bus to Boston. From Boston, I took a bus to Hanover, NH where I was picked up by a trail angel, Deb. On Friday, I was in a van/bus from 9 am to 8 PM. When I got to Deb and Andy's place, he had fixed an awesome dinner to which I thoroughly enjoyed! Deb and Andy are truly a blessing. Today, Deb had to work, and Andy shuttled me everywhere to resupply. I have met some of the best people on this trail. What a journey! I am headed south through Vermont and will finish the section I had to skip. I am excited and ready to finish this journey!! Many pictures have been downloaded! Don't forget to check them out! When I finally had cell service, I received many messages from those who have been praying and following the adventure. Thank you!! I appreciate all of you!!!!!","

Dulcigirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549795,"It's been a rough start into VT, but it is getting better. The first day back on the trail, a cold front was moving through the area. I froze that night and woke up with a very unpleasant head cold. I hiked about 3 miles, stopped, set up camp and crawled back into my sleeping quilt. The next day was better, but I was only able to hike about 6 miles before my body gave up the hike and I was back in the tent snuggled in my quilt. Here it is day 5, and I am at the cozy, warm Mountain Meadows Lodge in Killington, VT. The head cold is much better and I'm, once again, planning my hiking days over the next week. The leaves are beginning to change colors and I'm anticipating some beautiful Fall pictures soon!","

Yesterday, I was finally able to get a beautiful view from Glastenbury Mountain lookout tower. I was most eager to get into Bennington to dry out and clean up! I was a muddy mess! The guys at Catamount Motel were super and even had some excellent food from the grill trail magic. I will be crossing the VT / MA border today or tomorrow. The end is getting closer every day.","

I hiked into Williamstown just in time to attend the ALDHA Gathering. ALDHA is the Appalachian Trail Long Distance Hiking Association. These people have a true love and passion for hiking. At the assembly, a tribute to Baltimore Jack was outstanding. He obviously touched many lives. We also heard a presentation from a family who hiked the AT together over several years. Later in the evening, we had a bonfire at the campsite and time for further conversations with other hikers. It was awesome. I knew about the gathering, but honestly didn't think I would be able to attend. A BIG thank you to those who shuttled me around and provided trail magic during this event!","

MA completely spoiled me with great food and lodging along the way. I pushed long days and hiked on into the evenings with my headlamp, but it was so worth it. The views continue to be breathtaking...especially with the leaves changing colors. I love Fall and I could not have timed it better to enjoy the beauty of these mountains and lakes. The evenings are getting colder, but several of those evenings, I've been in a bunkroom, shelter, or lodge. On Mt. Greylock, I stayed in the Bunkroom with 3 other couples who were such a delight! We all enjoyed the good food and fellowship at the lodge on a cold, windy, rainy night. The next day, I hiked a long day in the cold rain, but the Dunkin Donuts in Cheshire, MA, the Dewey Restaurant in Dalton, and the Shamrock Village Inn that evening made the day wonderful! The following day, I had planned to go to the Upper Goose Pond Cabin, but at 8:00 PM stopped at the Berkshire Lodge. I wouldn't have gotten to the Cabin until 9:00 PM and would have awoken anyone already asleep. Like I said, MA was wonderful! I am completely spoiled! For a couple of nights, I was back in the woods, until I got to Salisbury, CT yesterday. Last night I stayed at trail angel, Maria McCabe's house. Today, I am resupplying, washing clothes, etc. to get me back on the trail again tomorrow. My kids are actively planning their trips to Delaware Water Gap, PA on October 29th. It is beginning to sink in...I'm almost done with the hike! All are invited to be there that day if you are anywhere near the DWG area on the 29th! Just let me know so we can make sure we have plenty of drinks and snacks for everyone.  We are having a celebration for sure...Lord willing, if nothing happens between Salisbury, CT and DWG, PA! Can you tell I'm getting excited??? :-)","

I hiked through CT in 3 days and still took my time to see the views and enjoy the hike along the Housatonic River. The best part of CT was being blessed by Maria McCabe. She is one of the most giving, hospitable individuals you will ever meet. NY has been just as beautiful as CT and MA. Though I had rain during my hike in VT, these states throughout this region are suffering from serious drought. It's been difficult for hikers to find water. Many of the streams and brooks are dry. Occasionally, I come across jugs of water at trailheads and what a blessing it has been!! I do not enjoy hiking in the rain, but the reality is, we need the rain. Today, I hiked over the Hudson River on Bear Mountain Bridge. It was beautiful! Tomorrow, I get to hike through the NY Zoo, hike over Bear Mountain, and view the Hudson River and NYC from the West Mountain Shelter. What an awesome day! It looks like I am still on target to finish on Oct. 29th in Delaware Water Gap. I am counting down the miles and the days!!","

When we arrived at the Mohican Outdoor Center to get warm and dry, we met Centaur, Mad Hatter, and Flicker. While waiting on Jeremiah to pick us up, we sat around the fire and shared AT stoties.

Dulcigirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551037,"2,189.1 miles --- I'm still trying to digest it all. Today was fantastic...better than I ever expected. The weather was beautiful, the walk was extremely easy and relaxing, and the fun with my 2 sons, Danielle (a family friend), and a few thru-hikers in the area, was phenomenal. The joy of actually finishing the trail is indescribable, but I can understand the bittersweet thoughts as well. It will take some adjusting to adapt to ""normal"" life again, I am sure. However as Forrest Gump said, ""I'm pretty tired. Think I'll go home now."" Though this has been the most challenging life experience, it has been the most rewarding. The question I was asked most often was, ""Are you hiking all by yourself?"" I was never alone. Other than the many other hikers and trail volunteers I had the privilege to meet and socialize with on the trail, my Lord and Savior was with me every step of the way. I never felt alone. I cherished my talks with God and fellowship with the trail community. I know I have said this before, but your thoughts, encouraging words, and prayers are a HUGE part of the success of this hike. A BIG SHOUT OUT to all of you who followed this journey vicariously and provided those moments of positive reinforcement! THANK YOU!!! Katelyn, Jake, Joan, and Diane, thank you for the care packages. Those packages helped more than you will ever know! Katelyn, Jake, and Isaac, thank you for being with me at the hospital and helping me through a very difficult time. I am so blessed with awesome kids. Jeremiah and Isaac...thank you for the great send-off on Springer Mountain, bringing me back to the trail and hiking with me then and at the end of the journey. Last, but not least, a major thank you to Shirley for managing my personal and business affairs while I was gone!!! You are a dear friend and a true Godsend!!
