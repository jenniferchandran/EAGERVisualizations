pidgeon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531374,The Hike InnI arrived right at 6:00PM which was when I guessed I might arrive. Nancy greets me. It's been about 15 years since I met her when I spent a night and got a shuttle into the smokies. They've been here 24 years. Now they've got satellite TV. Fifteen years ago it was one channel that was extremely fuzzy. It was Nancy who told me about thru hiking and suggested I read Officer Taco's trail journal. She's the one who planted the seed all those years ago that led to me hiking the A.T.She told me that they knew Officer Taco because they had shuttled him and his friend from here to there a couple years before I met Nancy and Jeff. After reading Officer Taco's trail journal I decided to hike the AT when I retired. All these years later she's helping get me started on my next to last section and hopefully I'll finish it all later this year.,"

pidgeon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531376,Start 11:20End 3:00Best Part - Relaxing watching the rainBiggest Complaint - Out of shape againOf course the first 1.4 miles are uphill. What would you expect. And yes I had to stop and rest a lot going uphill today. What would you expect. Being out of shape and having to get back in shape is the worst part of section hiking. I know how it works. I just want to skip this part.My first three days are relatively easy but that's followed by three twelve mile days. At this time I'm a little concerned about three twelve mile days but by the time I get there it will probably be no big deal. The weather was OK today but I can see that being hotter than desirable at times may be an issue on this hike.I was relaxing in the shelter when it finally rained. We have six in the shelter and five or so in tents. Several in the shelter are hiking together. It takes me awhile to get into the mood but meeting lots of new people is enjoyable. This year I'm meeting a lot of section hikers. A lot of people are drying out their stuff. It looks like by hurting my back and delaying my hike for four days it kept me from getting soaked. Another strategic injury to help keep me dry.,"The Hike Inn

pidgeon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531391,"Start 8:40End 1:00Best part - Nice weather, short dayBiggest complaint - None reallyI went ahead and had my normal breakfast. I first I thought it might be too much but it was OK. Three packages of oatmeal, a package of pop tarts and a carnation instant breakfast. You need energy to climb those hills. The weather was cooler which was good. I got to the shelter by 1:00 PMFor about twenty-five minutes I was by myself. The shelter had two levels. Floor level was room for 8-10. Above were two spots, left and right, each had room for one or a tight two. I decided to take the upper left. It's a bit of a hassle but you do have some degree of privacy.There's two couples in the lower level and Lucy has rigged up her hammock and hammock tent. A lot of stakes but a nice setup. Lucy is from east texas. Another couple has a tent and there's one more tent whose occupants I haven't seen yet. Eight in tents, six in the shelter. There was a folding chair with a back at the shelter. Some kind person hiked this chair to the shelter. Since you never have a place to sit with your back supported on the A.T. it's nice to have a chair to sit in.With an easy day tomorrow I think I'll be ready for three twelve mile days. We'll find out.","Tray Mountain Shelter

These are the kind of things that come to mind when you hike in the woods by yourself. The answer is ""I don't care"". Another beautiful day. It was very windy this morning and I considered wearing my jacket but by the time I got to the top of the mountain where I had decided to stop and take my pack off to put my jacket on I had warmed up enough so I didn't bother.It's only 3.6 miles to the hostel. When I got to the road a lady volunteered to take me to 'Top of Georgia' hostel which is 0.5 miles from the trail head. Free coffee. At the hostel ice cream was either a 'nutty buddy' or an ice cream sandwich. I was able to buy individual oatmeal packets and poptarts. I decided to take an extra day to get to my next resupply so I had to add a days worth of food to what I had planned. I already had an extra dinner and lunch so I only needed to add one extra breakfast and a couple snacks. The first two twelve mile days will now be three days; 9, 7.7 and 7.6 miles.We get a free breakfast here. That will be tomorrow morning from 7:00 A.M. till 8:00 A.M. The hikers I've met so far are almost all younger. The crowd in the hostel are playing cards and since there all in their twenties I don't feel much like joining in. Ben and Barb, aka Pokeman and Poky are 69 and 65. It's getting so I don't meet many hikers older than me. That's what happens when you keep getting older.","Deep Gap shelter

pidgeon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532135,"Start 8:11End 12:45Best part - Getting tent up before rainBiggest complaint - Windy gapWhen I arrived at Top of Georgia hostel yesterday my pack weighed 26 pounds. When I left this morning with 4 1/2 days of food my pack weighed 35 pounds. I have improved in pack weight over the years. Forgetting things helps. This year I forgot my poison ivy medicine and my watch. There has been a lot of poison ivy by the trail but as usual I haven't gotten it this year. I like to have a watch so I don't use my phone to check the time all the time and use up my phone battery. Actually not having a watch makes me check the time less which makes the time go faster. I also forgot bacon bits but Fritos fills in as an alternative additive for Raman or mashed potatoes. Today I leap frogged several times with two girls and their dog. They leaped frog one last time and then hiked on while I stayed at Bly gap. Bly gap was very windy, so windy I considered not staying but I made my plan so I stayed with it. It was a bad decision. The wind just made it uncomfortable. I found a lot of firewood at the next campsite and started a fire but it started to rain so I got back in my tent. I heard someone putting up tents while I was safely dry in my tent. I got out later and they were in their tents. I got the fire going again and when they got out I invited them to enjoy the fire. They ended up cooking by the fire while I decided I'd rather eat summer sausage sandwiches. I went in my tent to eat inside out of the cold while they finished their meals outside.","Top of Georgia Hostel

pidgeon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532136,"Start 9:37End 2:35Best part - Being in the Standing Indian areaBiggest complaint - The climb out of Bly gapAfter a good breakfast and a long sleep in out of the cold I started the days hike. The trail out of Bly gap is steep and long. A hard way to start the day. Uphill is still quite an issue. I'm getting better but it's still quite a chore.Standing Indian is an area I'm familiar with so hiking through here is kinda neat. This overall section of trail has not been that tough but it does have a lot of up and down. The amount of rocks in the trail has been at a minimum but that's starting to change. Other than the ups and downs it's a lot easier than hiking in Maine. It's also pretty remote. You don't cross roads very often. Hearing a car in the distance signally a road crossing hasn't happened very often.My boots are falling apart. The part of my boot near my little toe on my left foot is coming apart. I'm using duct tape to try to keep it together but I'm running out of duct tape. I think I'm going to have to have my wife send my other boots to one of my stops to be able to make it to Fontana Dam, my final destination.","Bly Gap

pidgeon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532137,"Start 10:02End 2:28Best part - Hiking stick burnt in fireBiggest complaint - Boots falling apartWhen I went to leave this morning my hiking stick wasn't on the tree where I had left it. I mentioned it to Cory and he said he had indeed used it for the fire. When I leaned it there I thought it might get put in the fire if I leave it here but I figured not a problem, I'm ready to move on to a new stick anyway. I found a stick that was a little fatter than what I normally find. After a while I was ready to try something not so fat. I put my stick down and started to move on when I realized the fatter stick was better for me to use. I get corporal temporal syndrome, tingling in my hands, from clenching my hiking stick and a thinner stick lets you clench your hand tighter which is bad while a thicker stick makes you grip less tightly which is good. The fatter stick doesn't feel right but using it makes my hands feel better.This morning I reached Standing Indian mountain top. This is a spot I've camped at before. My friend Rick is friends with Ron who lives near here. We've backpacked in this area setting up a base camp and then doing day hikes. One year after staying at Mt. LeConte in the Smokies with my wife, sister-in-law and her husband they dropped me off at Winding Stair gap and I hiked to Rock gap which is where I'm hiking to tomorrow. From there I took a short cut to Standing Indian mountain and met Rick and Ron and the gang. After some camping and hiking with them Rick gave me a ride back to Ohio.When I reached the mountain top I called Rick to let him know I was at Standing Indian. I also called my wife and found out my son is taking my wife to the Kentucky Derby for Mother's Day. I told them to put my money on Blue Nose.","Standing Indian shelter

pidgeon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532138,"Start 8:37End 3:33Best part - 12.1 miles wasn't badBiggest complaint - None reallyThe trail was pretty nice in the morning and after Albert mountain it was nice the rest of the way. Albert mountain has a fire tower with great views. It's also a good place to make phone calls. The climb to get to the top is tough and reminded me of Maine. Fortunately it wasn't too long of a steep climb.I talked to Tish and also called one of the outfitters in town and found out they carry Keen brand of hiking boots. I've decided I'm going to bite the bullet and go ahead and buy new boots. I want to get the same brand and style I'm wearing now to make the breaking in as easy as possible. Tomorrow I'm going to catch the Macon County Transit shuttle bus. From Feb 15 thru May 27 they do a shuttle service that picks up hikers at Winding Stair gap, Rock gap and a couple more stops at set times during the day. It's more than 10 miles to Franklin. My original plan was to hike the 3.8 miles to Winding Stair gap Monday morning and catch the shuttle there. Then I realized that since I've already hiked that section I can get picked up at Rock gap instead. Not hiking the 3.8 miles gives me a zero day and when I get the shuttle back the next day I'll get dropped off at Winding Stair gap, hopefully with a new pair of boots.","Carter Gap shelter

pidgeon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532911,Best part - Food truckBiggest complaint - Young crowdAfter getting up and doing my morning routine I was just about ready to put everything in my pack and a guy showed up. It's the guy who runs the hostel I'm going to. Now I don't need to wait for the Macon County shuttle. There's two hostels in town and they compete for hikers so he was looking for anybody who might want to stay at his hostel.After a lazy time waiting for my laundry at the hostel I took a ten minute walk to town and went to Outdoor 76. I bought new boots and new convertible trousers. My old convertible pants had fly zipper problems. My new pair are gray instead of my usual khaki. The new ones don't have a zipper at the bottom of their pants leg. With the zipper you can remove them without taking your boots off. Supposedly Columbia does't make them that way anymore.Two guys that were at the shelter the night before were at the outfitter store. Four of us were going to meet at Muligan's. I stopped at an ATM and lost sight of them. When I got there there was one large group and a few people at the bar. My friends were nowhere to be found. I went back to the outfitters. Over an hour later when I arrived with the rest of the group the three hikers I was looking for earlier were just leaving. It turns out they were out back on the patio. Then we walked across that part of town again and went to a brewery. Breweries can sell beer if they have a food truck. The food I got at that food truck was better than most restaurants I've been to.Everybody's young. Bummer.,"Rock Gap shelter

The weather report was for afternoon showers and I decided to leave early and beat the rain. I only had 4.2 miles to get to the first shelter. I was the first one there. A ridge runner showed up soon thereafter and got all the trash from the shelter and the surrounding area. She told me about how the Cherokee had lived here. This area was the starting point of the trail of tears.Then Sandy Man showed up. A group of three showed up one at a time. I believe we had a total of fifteen eventually. We had 6 in the 12 foot wide shelter and 9 in tents. It was just too many people. Too much input. At least the group of three, one lady and one couple, were close to my age but not real close. The guy from the group close to my age had been an EMT person and also was an instructor. He said the three words EMT personnel hate the most are 'I'm a nurse'.","Gooder Grove hostel

I decided the shelter at capacity would be less desirable than pitching a tent. They appreciated my volunteering to pitch my tent. I also gave away a couple ezbit cubes for fire starters. One guy forgot to resupply his fire starters. They use a stick burning stove. He appreciated the gesture. I do a good deed and get to lighten my pack at the same time.The tent sites for this shelter are up on a ridge above the shelter with a short walk to get to them. We had four tents and three hammocks. You can see a city off in the distance which looks really nice at night. We think it's Franklin.The hike today had a lot of uphill. Tomorrow will have a lot of downhill. I guess it averages out. Doing 11.6 miles was a lot. We hiked by a stone tower today, not too tall but good views. I took a picture of what I think is a jack-in-the-pulpit. If anyone could confirm or deny let me know by signing my guest book.","Siler Bald shelter

I amazed myself. I guess I've learned a thing or two.This was a mostly downhill day, 11.6 miles. I got going and didn't want to stop for lunch. Hunger changed my mind so I had lunch around 1:00 PM. Today we came to Wesser Bald observation tower. All the thru hikers I've been bumping into said it was the best view so far on the AT. The room that I have at the Nantahala Outdoor Center is in basecamp, Kempart building, room 4. There's two bunks and a bench. Also supplied were a heater and a fan and a window. I learned a double tennis court is a great place to be assured of 'access to the sky' for my Spot Locater.After finishing my laundry I had a excellent meal at the restaurant including peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream and whip cream for dessert. The restaurant opens at eight in the morning and I hope to get there for breakfast soon thereafter.","Cold Springs shelter

Since most of it was gradual it wasn't that bad. Just past the summit was Sassafras Gap Shelter. That's the spot the thru hikers I had been seeing the last few days hiked past me and now I wouldn't be seeing them again. You just start getting to know people and then they're gone.That night at Locust Cove gap there were several section hikers. Seven tents and two hammocks if I remember right. One lady section hiker who had spent most of her life in Houston has been living in Paris the last eight years. I found I was unable to come up with the things to say in french. It was interesting talking with her. Her trailname is Texpat because she's from texas and she's an ex-patriot. She'll hike until the time she's allocated runs out. She won't be back next year to finish. She'll find some other interesting thing to do. Also in this new group are four guys who work for Fedex, two in Orlando, FL and another two from NC or TN. Also there were another two guys who manage first and second shift at a Hanes packaging and distribution for women's underwear. The first shift guy took the trailname of Underoo.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

I'm in better shape now and although I was the last to leave Locust Cove gap I was the first to arrive at Cable gap shelter. Most of my fellow hikers have only been hiking a few days and are not in shape.At one point as I was hiking I heard a noise like a branch hitting the ground. I turned around and it had landed right on the trail two feet directly behind me. It wasn't a big limb, maybe six feet long and one inch think. No big deal but it does make you stop and think what if.I watched Texpat put up her tent. It only weighs one pound. Although rather small it looked like it would do the job. She commented that the fabric is such that you just shake any water off, no water absorption to make your tent weigh more wet than dry. It's called Zpacks soloflex and cost $500 so you won't see me saying anymore about it.Texpat said that she had hiked Camino de Santiago, a backpacking trail 800 kilometers long in Spain, France and Portugal.

Before you reach the Dam you come to the marina. When I was here 15 years ago there was a soda vending machine and parking for the marina. I use to park here for smokies back packing trips. Now the parking area says 'customer parking only' and there is a separate backpacking parking lot. There's also restrooms and a soda vending machine. I stopped to have a diet coke.I hiked on to the Fontana shelter known as Fontana Hilton. This shelter has electricty, lights and access to showers at the dam. There's supposed to be laundry too but I didn't see that.Continuing on to the dam on the way I ran into Matt, a guy that I shared the Rock Gap shelter with three days before. We hiked together for awhile and he wanted to stop and appreciate the view of Fontana lake. It's good to have fellow hikers that remind you to stop and smell the roses so to speak.I got to my car at the dam. I took time to get a free shower at the dam and then started the long drive home. Now I'll mention that I only got sprinkled on once. It only rained when I was in a shelter or a hostel. I didn't want to say anything before and jinx it.I plan on hiking my last section, 142 miles in Maine, starting in late July.","Cable Gap shelter
