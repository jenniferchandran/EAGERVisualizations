Katie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/376625,"Hello friends, family, internet browsers who stumbled here, and new friends I will one day meet on the trail!My name is Katie, but soon I hope to be known by a new name, my trail name, because I will be hiking the Appalachian Trail NOBO in 2016!!Thru-hiking the AT has been on my mind since I was a little girl (more on this later), but only recently have I figured out the ""how"". In doing so it went from becoming a far off dream to a realistic goal. Right now I am finishing up my final month of medical school. In less than 2 months I will be starting a 3 year Emergency Medicine residency in North Carolina training to become an ER doc, hence the protracted start date. Four years in advance is probably a bit early to be starting a trail journal, but I’m excited! Once a decision like this is made it’s hard not to shout it from the rooftops. I’d also like to keep track of my preparatory progress and share it with my friends in family. Until the date gets closer I will probably only write a few times a year during major advances or setbacks and during hikes leading up to “the hike”. Wish me luck,Katie",,The Beginning,"May 05, Sat",0
Katie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/376826,"I thought I’d come up with an FAQ
Why hike the Appalachian trail?
From the day I learned about the Appalachian trail (age 6 or so?) and learned that some people actually hike all 2000+ miles of it, I have wanted to be one of those individuals. I used to drive regularly under the AT where it crosses over I-70 and always stare up in awe. When a few friends asked me to go on a section hike with them a few years back I jumped at the chance. I couldn’t believe I was going to hike on THE Appalachian trail! We picked the trek across Maryland from the Pennsylvania border to Harpers Ferry. Coincidentally we hiked over that I-70 overpass, which thrilled me beyond words. The hike was a little over our beginner heads. None of us had really been backpacking before, yet we did 42 miles in 2.5 days. Somehow at the end, despite the inability to move the lower half of my body, and the comfort of Outback Steak House (our post-trail resuscitation), all I could think about was that I wanted to keep walking. I just need to keep walking. 
Still though, reality has a way of squashing dreams. By this time, I was in medical school, uncertain of what the future held, but with a mountain of loans over my head hiking the AT seemed far from the realm of possibility. That is, until I decided to go into emergency medicine. Emergency medicine is unique in the medical field in that it involves shift work. There are no pagers going off in the middle of the night, no patients phoning while the doctor is on vacation. We come in, we work, we go home. That being said, it’s very amenable to working for a time, then picking up my things and going to hike a trail for 6 months. 
That opened up a whole new world for me. I can do this…I CAN hike the AT! But do I want to? Yes, a resounding yes. 
What do I hope to learn from hiking the AT?
I want to learn to rely on myself. I want to grow as an individual. I want to enjoy the company of strangers, but I also want to learn how to be alone. I want to be afraid, but to face my fears and come out ok. I want to push my body to the limits and see how strong it can be. I want to learn what it’s like to be really truly hungry, and then I want to eat the world’s largest pizza. I want to discover the kindness of strangers and I want to be kind to strangers. I want to meet people from all over the world and from all walks of life and hear stories. I want to turn off my cellphone and see what it’s like to have no care in the world but food, water, good company, and finding the next shelter. 
Who will you go with? 
It's hard enough trying to convince someone to hike 2000 miles with me, I imagine it'd be even harder to find someone ready to make that commitment on the same timeline as me! If I try to make plan around others I will never make it to Georgia. I will WELCOME company on the trail, but I will plan solo. 
Aren’t there like…bears and stuff?
Yes, and I hope I see one! My biggest fear though is injury. I have a long history of tendinitis, bursitis, shin spints, etc. 
Why 2016?
I have 3 years of residency ahead of me. Then I will need at least a couple months of working to raise the funds.
What do you think will be the hardest part?
Not having a steady supply of coffee. I may try to hike with a small filter for a bit, but I may try to give up caffeine, we shall see!
What’s your trail name?
I don’t have one yet! Some people call my tortoise on hikes because I have a constant speed. People race past me on down hills but I don’t slow down on the ups and I rarely take breaks. I think there are already a few tortoise’s though.
What’s your favorite trail meal?
I am a HUGE fan of mountain house beef stew…I would eat this in my kitchen if it weren’t so darn expensive. I also have an unending love of fruit rollups. On a regular day…meh, but on the trail sooo darn good.",,FAQ,"May 06, Sun",0
Katie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/376957,"Whew, deep breath. Ok third entry...let's take this thing live! 
I am so excited for four years from now I only have hiking things on my brain. It also helps that I am graduating in 2 weeks and have no other responsibilities. Yesterday I made the
cat stove for <$10. It boils water so quickly I am kicking myself for ever spending on money on a canister stove! Why, just whyy?
Later this week I am headed to Fox Creek to section hike down to Damascus. I look forward to meeting some of the other Thru-hikers on their way up! I will write more about the trip when I return.
