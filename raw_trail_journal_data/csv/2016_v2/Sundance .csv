Sundance ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/311653,I have a one way airline ticket to Atlanta GA. No checked baggage since I sent my pack ahead to the hostel. I arrived at Pgh.Int. at approx. 0815 hrs and was at my departure gate at 0830hrs. No problem at all. Flew into Atlanta made it to the MARTA and waited a North Springs till Josh from the Hiker Hostel picked me and my fellow hikers up and drove to the Hostel at Dahlonega.,,Dahlonega GA,"Mar 27, Sat",0
Sundance ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/313602,"As I go on with this journal I will focus the trail, the people, and the experience as a whole. Any person who has walked any length of this trail knows it is about the physical and mental struggles of the trail itself. It is about the people you meet on the trail, the people in the trail towns that support the hikers and the friends and family you left at home. It is about the true pleasure one can get only from drinking directly from a cold mountain spring when you are really thirsty or crawling into a comfortable sleeping bag and tent at the end of along day of hiking.Of course I was full of excitement to set my feet on the Appalachian Trail for the first time in my fifty-four years of existence. The ride up to Springer Mt. that Josh from the Hiker Hostel was a harrowing fish tailing ride to the top. So the whole way to the top Josh is giving info that few of us in the back can hear. I am hoping it is not too important since I really have only one shot to get this right. We all file out of the van, about eleven people. Josh tells us we are on the AT. The parking lot is part of the trail. He gives instructions on how to get to the actual southern terminus of the AT. I was concerned because I needed him to pick me up at Gooch Gap 16.5 miles away and I wanted verbal confirmation. He started to try to talk me out of doing the 16.5 miles. I could not believe it. This was my plan and he knew it. My friends that I met at the hostel are far ahead of me on their way to the rock, where I was counting on us taking each other’s pictures. I told Josh to plan on picking me up at Gooch Gap. Another man in the parking lot tried talking me out of it. He began to explain why he never does any more than 10 miles a day. By this time I am getting irritated. I simply walked away from my unsolicited adviser and caught up with my friends on the trail.We took our pictures and on the trail we were. Now I chose to slack pack GA, so I am staying at the hostel each night. It rained off and on for most of the day. The hiking was basically what I had expected it to be. Most notable is Sassafras Mt. elevation 3,300 ft. The big toe on my left foot is still black from it.I make it to Gooch Gap about 4:30. I am tired and a bit sore but I made the first 16.5 miles of the AT.","Springer Mt. GA

Sundance ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/315198,"I will remind all of you that I chose to slack pack Georgia. That means hiking with just a daypack. I had to be back at my job in one month, so any way that I could turn in big miles I had to do. So March 28, 2010 Leigh from the Hiker Hostel drops me off at Gooch Gap, where I had left off the day before. My goal is Neel’s Gap about 14 miles away. I get out of the van and something very important happens. Leigh points in the right direction. This is important because when you ride winding mountain roads you are not familiar with you think you know which way to go. You don’t. Listen to the people who do. I would have hiked the wrong way, but Leigh corrected me. Thank you. Some nice hiking to Woody Gap. When I say nice I mean fairly flat and pretty. After Woody Gap I got a real good taste of the ups and downs that I would experience on the trail throughout the state of Georgia.Start at 2,2784 ft. ele. up and down to Woods Hole at 3,600 ft. ele. to Blood Mtn. 4,450 ft. ele. to Neels Gap at 3,125 ft. ele. and think how you would feel at the end of the day. Well okay at the end of the day you are tired and sore and feel great because, you just did it.Between Woody Gap and Blood Mtn. there are the usual ups and downs. The climb up to Blood Mtn. is a good climb through a lot of rhododendron. I use the phrase “good climb” when it is the highest elevation on the AT in GA. When I arrived at the top it was so foggy the only thing I could photograph were the shelter and the trail itself. Then I started about a two mile descent. The descent is mostly boulders and various rocks and roots. Anyone that has hiked a trail considered to be difficult knows the strain of a long steep ascent. They also know the pain of a long and steep descent. By this time my knees are feeling both. The conditions on the trail are cold and wet. I make it to Neel’s Gap just a few minutes before Josh from the Hiker Hostel arrived to pick me up.I have done my best to describe the trail today. At the beginning of this journal I made the point that this experience is also about the people. Let us keep in mind that the AT in Georgia presents a challenge to hikers because of the topography and because this is the starting point for most thru-hikers. This is where your body has to adjust to the trail and the truth is that only three things happen; you adjust and continue, you sustain an injury and get off of the trail, you realize that you underestimated the difficulty of the trail and you get off. I watched hikers deal with the blisters, joint pain, and general fatigue the entire time that I was on the trail. I dealt with one type of pain or another from the time I made to the top of Sassafras Mtn. till a week or so after I finished up at Erwin, TN. What really made an impression on me was the look of distress in the female hikers. This was in the first few days of the hike when the Georgia mountains are really taking a toll. The only other time in my life that I had noticed this distressed appearance in women was in basic training while in the Air Force. After the first week I only met a couple of female hikers with the same appearance.","Gooch Gap

Sundance ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/315209,"So today I intend to hike 20.2 miles between Neels Gap and Unicoi Gap. The night before Josh helped me plan the hike. He recommended that I flip flop and hike north to south to take advantage of the terrain. He advised that I make sure that I have enough calories for the 20.2 miles and that while hiking maintain a steady pace and not slow myself down by stopping and talking with other hikers. I started from Unicoi Gap about 7:45 am. I began the hike in a very dense fog. About 1 ½ miles into the hike the fog lifted and I ran into the first of five different hikers I had met at the hostel. I stopped to talk to each one of them. Thus my retraction of my earlier statement. It is gratifying to see hiker that you started out with doing well on the trail. This section has some serious ups and downs but for the most part is downhill when SOBO. There were some very nice views. This is when my good knee started to hurt. I was being careful on the steep descents not to fall. My bad knee is my left one so I was leading with my right. I tended to go very slow on the descents. The hills are steep and you generally are walking on huge boulders that if you fell wrong it would be easy to crack a rib and end your hike much too early. The day was cold and it misty. I arrived at Neels Gap about 6:20 pm. I was feeling the accumulative effect of hiking big miles in Georgia. At Neels Gap I met “Lumpy” who gave me a coke so I gave him a cigar. “Cool Breeze” arrived and shuttled me back to the hostel. I want to mention “Mountain Squid”, “Cool Breeze”, and “Frank Foot”. These are three trail veterans that when I told them my plan was to hike from Springer Mt. GA to Erwin TN in one month each one replied that it was very doable. When I arrived at the hostel I showered and popped two of my miracle drug aspirin and felt better in minutes. 50.9 miles in. hikers. He knew that already I was skipping breakfast. They serve a fantastic breakfast at the hostel. For some reason I have to force myself to eat when I am hiking. I told him that I never stop and talk to other hikers. I only talk with them when we are heading the same direction. I retracted that statement at the end of the day.","Unicoi Gap

Sundance ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/318446,"My final day of slack packing GA is from Unicoi Gap to Dicks Creek Gap. It is a 16.6 mile hike. Two miles into the hike my good knee stiffened up and began to hurt. The pain on the down hills was excruciating. I really slowed me down. I ran into “Snickers”, “Daytripper”, and “Dryclean”. Daytripper saved my hike by dumping out everything in his pack to retrieve two aspirins for me. I saw them again at the summit of Tray Mnt. I hiked with them off and on throughout the day. I ran out of water on the way up Kelly Knob. This was a climb that I will not soon forget. I found the water source at the Shelter below Kelly Knob. This was my toughest day yet on the trail. I expected to get to Dicks Creek by 4:30 but did not arrive till 6:30. The long descent into Dicks Creek was very painful.","Unicoi Gap

Sundance ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/315353,"It is April 1st and I did not want to fool around, because today I planned on crossing the GA/NC state line. Josh got a flat tire so I did not get on the trail until 1230pm. I was excited to end my slack packing and sleep outside in my tent and sleeping bag. Josh and Leigh run a first rate hostel. I learned that hostels are just not for me. This is just personal preference and not due to any hostility encountered at the hostel. The band aid on my nose in my profile picture was the result of a breath right strip that when I removed it half of my nose was ripped off due to sun burn from the previous day. I was using the strips as not to bother the others in the room with my snoring. On the way to Dicks Creek Gap, Josh gave me a very good overview of what to expect on my way to Erwin TN. Of course Georgia was not going to let me go easily. The climb out of Dicks Creek was not as bad as I had expected. The elevation change from Dicks Creek to the GA/NC line is 2,675 to 3,825. So considering the big miles I had put in the days before I took notice of the change in terrain. I was so happy to be out Georgia and cross into North Carolina. This is an important part of my trip because this is when I first met three hikers from the British Isles who I became friends with, we hiked together off and on. They had no trail names and I sensed they preferred not to, at the time. They were Jimmie, who I had actually met a day earlier on a shuttle. Jimmie is from Scotland, Bill from England, and Tony born in England ,but now resides in Ireland.","Dicks Creek Gap
",Bly Gap,"Apr 01, Thu",9
Sundance ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/318443,"I had a good nights rest in my tent, (a North Face Mica 12) which I love. I forced myself to eat some of my food. I enjoyed my instant coffee and drank as much water as I could before leaving Bly Gap. Today’s elevation change will start at 3,840 and ascend to 5,498. I departed camp about 8:30am and dealt with two steep climbs immediately. Most of the springs had water flowing, so that was nice. I decided that if the water was coming directly out of the ground I would not purify it, but if it was an actual exposed stream then I would. It worked for me because I never had any problems. In fact during my entire hike I felt great. Yes there were times of fatigue and muscle soreness. If I stopped for just a few seconds or a minute or two, I recovered quickly. Even though I knew I needed to take in more calories I had plenty of energy. It is a 2.8 mile ascent up Standing Indian Mountain. On all of my long ascents I would change to a slow but steady pace. This way, I could stop and recover in just a few seconds and get going again. My experience on the Laural Highlands and Susquehannock Trails in Pennsylvania proved to be invaluable because I had learned to expect false summits and was not intimidated by these climbs that seemed to have no end. It is easy to understand why so many hikers give up in Georgia. If you are not mentally and physically prepared, these hills can do anybody in! So when I am almost to the summit of Standing Indian Mountain I meet Jimmie the Scotsman. He is in his 60’s and one tough hiker and one nice guy. We took a break together and headed for the summit. There were still patches of snow on the summit. I lost track of Jimmie. I knew he was behind me. I start the descent, which was full of exposed tree roots. Suddenly I hear something rushing at me from behind. I thought, I was being attacked by a bear or wild boar. I turned, assumed a fighting stance and raised my trekking poles to defend myself as best I could. If it was a bear I knew I had to stand and fight. If it was a boar I knew my only chance was to get up off of the ground. It was Jimmie. He had caught up to me and had tripped over one of those exposed roots. After flying through the air, he fell on his knee and cut his head. He was a little dazed but recovered quickly and we hiked a while together and ended up camping in the same area that night. That night while talking with the other Brits I referred to Jimmie as “The Flying Scotsman” for the way he came flying at me from behind. This is how trail names come about. I also ran into another hiker “Ripple” who’s journal I had read. When I got to camp and removed my boots one of the other hikers commented on my bloody sock. I treated these blisters quickly with Neosporin and kept them clean so they never got infected and healed.I slept very well. I had my coffee and breakfast, which was probably just a power bar. I filled my water containers and hit the trail around 8:45. I was being bothered by bugs and wished I would have kept my deet in my pack, but I decided I would not need it this time of year. I was wrong. I got stung by something below my left eye while taking down my tent and thought very little of it. I was happy because the trail was fairly level for some distances enabling me to make some great time. As the day progressed I noticed my left eye swelling. I already have a band-aid on my nose and now a swollen left eye. I ran into a family that was hiking the trail only for a couple of days and we would take each other’s picture at the vistas. They must have been used to thru-hikers because they were not taken aback the least bit my appearance. Thank you Frank Foot for the trail magic at Mooney Gap. The climb up Albert Mountain will forever live in my memory. I met up with the Brits and a married couple - Carl and Carrie from Kentucky that I became friends with and saw quite a bit on the trail. Frank Foot gave me a PBR. I am not really a PBR man. I chilled it in the stream and slowly sipped it. It was one the best tasting beers I have ever had. True trail magic.","Bly Gap

I met up off and on with the Brits throughout the day and we ended up camping together at Wine Spring, elevation 5,290ft. This was when we really started to get to know each other. When I told them I lived in the Pittsburgh Pa. area they asked if I was a coal miner. They were surprised when I told them how clean the city is and that the rivers were full of game fish. The temperature was extremely hot for someone that is used to much cooler weather in April. It was in the 80’s. The trail offered lots of up and down, but I appreciated how in NC they at least used switchbacks and take around the mountain in the ascents whereas in GA they like to straight up and down the mountain. The hiking has been what I expected, tough. The friendship has been what I expected. Great! I camped at Wine Spring. We agreed that of all the challenges the trail missing our families is the hardest to deal with. There was never a discourteous word spoken between us. We were similar in age 50’s and 60’s and similar in culture so really enjoyed each other’s company. At least that was my impression. I probably should have asked them before making such a statement.","Rock Gap

Near Burningtown Gap I received trail magic from Apple. I have been enjoying the trail a lot since departing GA, because I am still making big miles with my pack and get to sleep in my tent every night. I am still forcing myself to eat. I know I need to eat more but I just lose my appetite on the trail. The views from Wayah snd Wesser Balds were unparalleled. I camped at Wesser Bald shelter with Bill, Tony.

I arrived at NOC about 1115am and checked in at the office and got a nice room for $66 with a shower and a bath across the hall. I picked up my mail drop at the outfitters. The outfitters asked to see my id before giving me my mail drop, which seemed like a good idea. I had a Wesser burger with a couple I has met on the trail. Where else can you can you feel comfort in asking someone you met only once before if you can sit at their table for lunch? The restaurant is located right beside the river. I purchased a quart and six pack of ale to take back to my room. I had dinner with Tony, Bill, Jimmie (The Flying Scotsman), and Eric another hiker I met at the lodge.We enjoyed buffalo wings and wine. I enjoyed explaining what buffalo wings were to my English friends. The staff at the NOC is top notch. Whether at the outfitters, oufitters, or at the lodge, the staff was friendly and couteous. The highlight of the day was getting to speak to my wife, which I has been unable to do since I left GA. The battery in my phone died because it had come on accidentally. Another hiker suggested that I remove the battery while hiking, which I did and never lost the charge again.

You could see how many trees had fallen during the winter. The trail maintainers had already cleared most of them. The weather was sunny and hot.

It rained hard all day. Every hiker was soaked to the bone. I pushed on to Cable Gap. Just after 2:30 pm, it still raining. I went to the privy and put on my dry clothes since there were other hikers in the shelter. I set my tent up in the shelter with the rainfly on it and carried it to spot and set it up. I crawled inside it and took a nap and warmed up. My tent stayed perfectly dry. The Englishmen decided to push on to Fontana Dam in the rain.

Buck was able to get a fire going and dry Sniffer’s clothes. They both looked fine on the trail today. I made it to Fontana Dam around 11:30 am. I dialed 0 on the phone at the visitor’s center. The man that answered contacted Hike in for me where I had reservations. They picked me up in less than 20 minutes. I highly recommend the Hike Inn.

Staying there too were Cope who I had met at Cable Gap and I met another thru-hiker Rabid. Nancy drove the three of us to a fine Mexican restaurant and then to a grocery store re-supply. I did not need anything from the grocery store since I had a mail drop sent the Hike Inn. This was my second mail drop and the second time I ended up giving half of my re-supply away because I just could not eat all of the food.

My pack was the heaviest it has ever been and the climb into the Smokies is huge. Jeff drove us to the trailhead and along the way gave a very in depth briefing about hiking the Smokies. The one piece of advice that stuck with me was. “Do not set leave your pack unattended.” He said the bears will stock a hiker and wait for the pack to be unattended and will simply run off with it. My goal for today is Mollies Ridge Shelter. The starting point is Fontana Dam Visitors Center at 1,700 ft. elevation. Mollies Ridge is 4,520 ft. with the heaviest pack I have carried yet.

I learned the importance of backtracking the hard way on the Black Forest Trail the hard way in Pennsylvania. I went back down to the stream and found a blaze and saw the double blaze I had missed. I was back on the trail. My plan was to hike to Deer Park shelter and camp and head into Hot Springs the next day. I arrive at the shelter and realized I had hiked 15 miles instead of the 12 I had planned. The gap was 12 miles but the shelter was 15. It was 5pm and the water source was extremely far from he shelter area.The Flying Scotsman decided to trek on into Hot Springs since it was only 3 miles and mostly down hill. I had reservations at the Duckett House but I was two days ahead of schedule and and I did not know if they would have a room for me. I got cell service and found one was available but lost call before I could confirm it. I shouldered my pack headed for Hot Springs. I decided to take my chances because a hot shower and a cold ale were calling my name. I ran into The Flying Scotsman. I passed him and told him I would see him in Hot springs.Once in Hot Springs, I was able to call Duckett house and confirm the room. The owner said he had to run errands and to see Steve another hiker who would show me to my room. I met Steve and he showed me to my room. I set things down and asked Steve if anyone could drive me to get some food and ale. He said he could, said he had already had a couple of beers himself and did not want to drive. He asked me if I had a driver’s license and asked if I had been drinking. I told him I did have driver’s license and of course had not been drinking. He gave me directions and handed me the keys to his car. He said be careful that the steering was very responsive because it was a beemer. Only on the AT would another hiker hand the keys to their BMW over knowing you for a whole 15 minutes. Steve’s trail name is Dr. Evil. Thank you Dr. Evil. I got my ale and ordered food at the Rock Bottom. I can not say enough good things about the Rock Bottom in Hot Springs NC. The food and service were top notch. The waitresses were attractive, friendly and attentive.","Roaring Forks Shelter

Little Hump tops out at around 5,459 ft. and Hump at around 5,587 ft. The only way to escape this weather was to get to a lower elevation.As soon as I began to climb these mountains, the wind, snow and sleet pounded me. The rocks were icy and very slippery. Because of the high winds my hood was pasted to the left side of my face allowing me to only see out my right eye. I could not see the posts with the blazes. I just kept my head down and followed the path. My gait was that of a drunken sailor, trying to keep my balance between the wind and the ice on the trail. At one point the wind knocked me down.

It was at Apple house that I met another hiker “Restless” who was also from PA. We ended up hiking together ‘sort of’ all the way into southern Virginia. Restless is a fast hiker. He slept in the shelters and was usually on the trail by sun up. I on the other hand preferred my tent and was usually on the trail between 8 and 8:30 am.

The biggest mile day, I have done before was 20miles between Unicoi and Neels Gap in Georgia, and that was slack packing. So hey why not do a 21 mile day with a full pack? Something we discussed the night before was the lack of water sources once you crossed I-77. It was pretty hiking all of the way to I-77. My plan was to get water from Kimberling Creek and I would be good for the last 11 or so miles till I reached Jenny Knob shelter. I finished the water I had just before the bridge over I-77 and was looking forward to getting more because the day was hot. I crossed over I-77 and re-entered the woods and came Kimberling creek. The first thing I noticed was that the water was discolored and had a nasty looking foam on it. It also appeared to come from a direction that ran directly underneath I-77. I decided I would take my chances and find another water source. After crossing the creek the trail ascends, cutting my chances of finding a water source. I did notice water flowing in a deep ravine to the left of the trail, but was entirely too steep to climb down. Hopefully there was a spring that fed it. I kept hiking and kept ascending. Then I spot the small streams source. It was a small spring. I still had to scale down a steep hillside to it, but I cleared the leaves out of it and it was good water. I drank as much as I could and filled my containers and headed to Jenny Knob. I arrived at the shelter about 7pm. Restless was surprised to see me and had already written in the shelter log that he had spent the night alone in the shelter. I decided to sleep in the shelter. About 7:30 Papa Muskrat showed up just as tired. We made room for him in the shelter. By the way, it was not 21 miles. It was 23.8 to be exact. That was my biggest hiking day of my entire hiking career.","Jenkins shelter

I hiked to Trent's store and had a fish sandwich and several cold drinks. I bought two 20 oz. Coors and carried them to Wapiti. For the first time since leaving Springer,there were sections of the trail that were almost flat as far as you could see. I made the 14.2 miles so quickly, I could not believe I was at the shelter already. After 23.8 miles it felt like a breeze. I set up my tent and ate my dinner and drank my two 20 oz. Coors beers. I am an ale drinker, not real fond of beer. Man, were they good. I enjoyed the company of other hikers who I realized have probably been hiking within a day or two of one another for quite a while. On the AT you can be a few minutes ahead or behind someone and if you don't stop or camp at the same place you will never see them.

This is my third section hike of the AT. I hiked from Springer Mt. Ga. To Erwin Tenn. In 2010, from Erwin to Daleville Va. In 2011 and this my attempt to pick up in Daleville and hike to Harper’s Ferry WV in 2012.
I consider myself a careful planner. The first snafu was when my wife booked the flight from Pittsburgh to Roanoke at an 8pm arrival instead of an 8am arrival. This put in me the airport around 11pm. I had arranged for a shuttle back to the trail at 6:30 am the next morning. My wife and daughter argued for me to get a hotel room and not sleep in the airport. I would have gotten maybe two hours sleep in a hotel room and been $100 lighter in cash so I made the best of it at the airport. I decided to use my time wisely and study my maps and trail companion while waiting. I searched my entire pack and realized I had left these crucial items at home. Anyone on a long distance hike knows how important knowing exactly where you are and having the ability to plan mileage is. But on the other hand anyone who has done any long distance hiking knows that things go wrong and you adjust. My wife tried to talk me into turning around and coming home. I was disgusted with myself for making such a blunder but knew I could still make this hike.
I slept not half bad in the airport. I knew in the morning that I had a friend who would help. Last year I was shuttled from the Super 8 to the hotel by a trail maintainer and all around good guy named Homer Witcher. I thought well he will know where there is an outfitter and I can just buy a new companion book. He gave me his data book instead. Just like Mike Wallace who shuttled me in Erwin Tn.

I have nearly 100 miles to hike to Montebello VA where I have a mail drop at the Dutch Haus. My goal for the day was an easy 11 miles and would be the second shelter I would come to. I decided to stop at Fulhartd shelter and start meeting some of the other hikers. Most of these hikers have been hiking for over 700 miles and running into each other off and on so they kind of know each other. When a brand new face shows up the first reaction is well who is this guy. But after just a few short days you are familiar with quite few people and quickly form friendships on the trail. I met many hikers this morning that would meet many more times on the way to Harper’s Ferry. I was going to get water at Fulhardt shelter but the water supply came from a cistern and had a yellow cast to it. I decided that getting water at Fulhardt shelter might be a foolhardy thing to do and opted for an upcoming stream. As a result of getting an early start and only hiking 11 miles I arrived at Wilson Creek shelter late afternoon. A hiker showed up who I could tell had been in the military by the way he was dressed and some of his equipment. He was the first black man that I had met on the Appalachian Trail. He said that he had been sick the last day or two and did not seem vary friendly. I learned a long time ago not to go on first impressions and to give people a chance. His trail name was August.

I wish I would have said anything but Pittsburgh because they were from Cleveland and apparently did not believe me when I said that I did not follow the sports teams because they insisted on talking about baseball. I know people like to live their lives vicariously through these sports figures. I just want to live my life vicariously through myself by hiking the trail and would like to get on with it.

I could not help but notice how many of these hikers were loaded down with heavy gear and over dressed. It is a serious climb out of Harper’s Ferry going southbound and these people were really struggling. They appeared to have more gear for two or three days than I would carry going for a week and 100 miles without resupply. I hiked to the ATC headquarters and registered as a section hiker. They took my picture. I got a shower at the hostel down the street and waited for my wife to pick me up. She emphasized that I must be showered before she picked me up.

I walked over an introduce myself. We had a very nice conversation. He told me he was considering closing the cabins and making everyone tent because allot of the thru-hikers were trashing them. What a shame that a few people can ruin something good for everyone else. I was happy to have replenished my water supply because I was headed for Pochuck Mtn. shelter where there is no water. This hike goes through a waterfowl preserve. I saw a bald eagle. I made the long steep climb to Pochuck shelter. This is a well maintained shelter that someone has taken the time to plant flowers around. I stayed in the shelter since no else was around. I received a phone message from my friend Mike back in PA wanting to know if I wanted to go backpacking this weekend.

Just like in the previous states, in NY if there is vertical pile of boulders you can pretty much plan on have to climb through it. It is cold, windy, and raining so hard that I could barely see while I am grabbing on branches and rocks to get to the top of ascents. The rocks are different in NY than PA. They smoother but steeply sloped as to become a slip and slide when they are wet. I took to sliding down them in a sitting position to keep from falling. I fell twice today. That makes four falls for this section hike. I had fallen twice in PA. I had fallen three times in each of my previous section hikes. Today, I officially broke my old record. I had to stealth camp near Furnace Creek. NY wants you to camp only at designated sites but they were few and never fit into my itinerary. It was raining steadily. One thing you get good at is pitching your tent and making a quick meal when the rain lets up for even a few minutes at a time. When you have to stealth camp, just do it in an area that is not too accessible from a road and do not start a camp fire. Chances are slim of being noticed.","Pochuck shelter

You descend beside small mountain streams covered by thick hemlock. You truly feel that you are in the middle of a pristine forest all alone. I crossed Lakes Road and met a local man smoking a cigar and walking his dog. He asked me the normal questions. I could tell he did not believe that I started in Harper’s Ferry WV on the 27th of March. Although he had never hiked any of the AT, he was an expert on the trail. He said if he hiked it he would have to take his dog. His dog looked to be about a 6-7 year old Golden Retriever. I said I would never take my dog on the AT. He asked why. I said I love my dog too much. It is as hard on them as it is on you. He responded, “well I guess some parts of it are pretty tough.” I ran into a section hiker who had already hiked most of the AT. Her trail name was Mrs. Joy. Through out this section hike I would greet southbound hikers by saying good morning, or good afternoon south bounder. They would usually just give a strange look and not reply. Mrs. Joy replied “good afternoon NOBO. This is how I knew she was an experienced AT hiker. She was looking for a place to camp.

If you are not used to it you it will tax you. So far the local hikers have grated on my nerves. From their expert advice, to them not believing me when I tell them how far I have hiked to being disgusted with the litter they have left behind. Or when I passed them they would look at me with fear and never respond when I greeted them. As soon as I crossed I-87 I started meeting up with some really cool day hikers. They could tell by my appearance and smell that I was a long distance hiker and approached me to ask about my hike. I ran into Three Dogs who had thru-hiked the AT. I would greet these NY hikers. They would return the salutation. Not like in MD, PA, and NJ where they would just look at you with a Homer Simpson look and never say a word. This was another long hiking day.

I read several journals noticing that many thru-hikers would end their hikes in Massachusetts due to fatigue and injury. I wondered why this was because the terrain was not nearly as tough as what they had already been through. By the time I made it to the Vermont border I realized what the accumulate effect of this constant up and down had on an already hurting body.On May 16 I flew from Pittsburgh PA to New York City. I took the airport shuttle from Laguardia to Grand Central to take the commuter train north to Wingdale NY where I had finished my section hike the year before. I had a long wait for the train to leave so I enjoyed hanging out with New Yorkers. Every time I go to NYC I find the people friendly and outgoing. A teacher with a group of school children stopped to ask different people why they were at Grand Central and where they were going. The teacher would instruct the students to takes notes. They were curious about me and my large backpack. I explained that I was hiking the Appalachian Trail and told them that the trail was 2,185 miles long and went all of the way from Georgia to Maine. I had to think that perhaps this might spark an interest in them to one day decide to hike it.I finally boarded the train and headed north with my heavy pack. I had to heavy of a pack not because I did not know better, but because I thought I could make it all of the way from the NY/CT border to Dalton MA without resupply. I was wrong. I did it but paid the price.On the train I met two other local hikers that had just finished a section and were heading home. I met a charming young lady visiting from Germany named Anna. Anna was trying to meet up with some friends but was not sure where the train stop was she was looking for. We were able to figure it out using my Transit app on my iphone and she made it. I made it to Wingdale and started walking the 3 miles back to the trail in the rain. A commuter recognized me from the train station and asked his taxi driver to stop and pick me up. This probably saved me at least a mile and half of road walking. Who ever says New Yorkers are unfriedly just have not met the the ones that I have.

I did run into Northern Wind again only because he had stopped in a town. This first day of real hiking took a toll on me. After climbing down John's Ledges I walked the along the river with few blazes. It seemed like forever wondering if I was still on the trail.

Heather’s mother worked with Hoot and offered to let us stay in her summer trailer that is right next door to her daughter Heather’s house. Heather’s husband Jason is a fisheries biologist for the state of Maine. Since I am a fisherman we had some great conversation. Heather took us to stores for resupply. Again an act of kindness that might have saved my hike.,"Belgrade

He picked up Hoot’s pack to see how heavy it was and said “now I really respect you guys.” We said goodbye and could not thank him enough for being so kind to us. We hiked to Poplar Ridge and camped. There were a lot of SOBOs and one or two NOBO thru-hikers. My knee was hurting bad.,"Belgrade

Pouring rain and lightning all around me. There is nowhere to go but forward as fast as I can. The trail is now a flowing stream in spots. All I can do is get to Maine 27 and off of this mountain as quickly as possible and away from the lightning. When I got to the road Public Address (trail name) was waiting for me.

I told him to go on without me. He didn’t seem happy about it. I told him he didn’t need me to continue. I said that he would meet other people to hike with. That is how it is on the AT. You make hiking friends very quickly. He said well you will have to be by yourself. I reminded him that my old trail name was Lone Wolf.

I said no I am heading back onto the trail. He said he often gives rides to hikers because his girlfriend had recently thru-hiked the AT and he likes to help the hikers. I thanked him and told how much hikers appreciate the help. Today ended up being my most rewarding day on the AT. I thought the Bigelows offered the most stunning views on the entire trail so far. I camped at Safford campsite with Miles, Archilles, and Black Hole. These were young SOBOs. I tried to offer them words of encouragement because they were already feeling the rigors of the trail and seemed a little intimidated by what was ahead.","Safford Campsite

One young couple had a dog that was really suffering. It was very hot and there is no water on the mountain. They were giving it water from a bottle but it was not enough. I would not take a dog on the AT for a long distance hike. Other Sobos were complaining about all of the false summits on this mountain. One said that the 100 mile wilderness almost killed him. I did not say much thinking they haven’t seen anything yet. Southern Maine is unforgiving. Then they still have the Whites. At bald Mountain Lean-to I met Scorch and PA Farm Boy. Scorch and I started talking about the logistics of getting home from Baxter. It felt strange that I had progressed to the point that finishing and exiting Baxter was a topic of conversation.,"Caratunk ME

A group of about 11 girls were there from a Girls Club in Maine. I was impressed with these young ladies. They were friendly and polite. They were up early and packed and ready to hike the next morning. It rained hard that night. In the morning Scorch said the people in the lean-to were worried about me. I did not understand why. When I headed back up the blue blazed trail Scorch reminded me that I could just follow the blue blazes south and get back on the AT where I got my water. I explained how I don’t skip even a small section of the trail. He understood in an amusing sort of way.,"Bald Mtn. Lean-to

I walked into Lakeshore to see Hoot. It was good to see him. He was headed out the next day.

I was waiting for my niece to pick me up and meet my wife and daughter in Portland. Another hiker Sarah heard that I was going to Portland and asked if she could ride along since she had broken her arm on the trail. I said of course knowing my niece and nephew would not mind. We rearranged the car and got Sarah to rest her arm on a beer case with ice on it for the trip to Portland. Just as we dropped Sarah off at her hotel near the airport I received a call from Hoot. 4 miles into the wilderness he had taken a nasty fall and injured his knee.

I was told by a SOBO that I might not want to do too many miles the next day because White Cap was a tough climb.

I climbed the 5.2 miles up Katahdin passing many tired and frustrated day hikers along the way. When I touched that sign I began to cry. I had my picture taken. I chose to celebrate very quietly holding my American flag and praying on my knee thanking God that I was able to make it to this point.
