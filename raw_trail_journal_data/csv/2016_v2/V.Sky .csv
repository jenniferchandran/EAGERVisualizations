Hi Everyone! I'm Paull (yep, 2 L's) and this is my first post! I've been reading the forums for a while now, I've just never actually registered to comment until now. Well, I've made the commitment to a 2016 Thru-Hike. 
He's the backstory: 
My 15.5 year old dog that I've had since he was 5 weeks old in February 2000 is starting to wind down to make his crossing over the Rainbow Bridge. This dude is as important to me as any parents kids are to them. He should be in HS right now LOL. I don't have kids and it's gonna be one of the hardest personal losses I'll ever have to deal with. I'm also a Marine combat vet with PTSD so I've made the commitment to thru-hike the AT to decompress and start fresh.
I live downtown Atlanta, I've got a really awesome home-life and and two fantastic people who will be a dependable support/logistics team for me and a cool job where I can take 6 months off to do this. I'll be 38, turning 39 on the trail in August 2016 and I always wanted to finish it before I turned 40.
Anywho, I'm not certain on my actual departure date because this is all contingent upon my pup and his quality of life. Next year is a leap year so the thought of stepping off on Feb 29 is pretty cool. That could also be a few weeks too early due to Georgia's winter this year 2015/16. We'll see. In the meantime, I'll be prepping and prepping and prepping. Cheers!",,"Mount Katahdin, Maine ","Aug 29, Sat",0

I'll have a lot of time to spend on the trail thinking about you. I'll love and miss you each day of forever.",,"Mount Katahdin, Maine ","Oct 31, Sat",0

I've unofficially made an official date to step out on the trail: Monday, March 21, 2016. I've also put in for a leave of absence at work, with my last day officially being Thursday, February 25, 2016. That's 54 days to the end of work and 79 days until I leave Springer Mountain. 
Everything is happening more quickly now. I'm not ready yet. I don't have all of the gear that I'm going to need. Got some things for Christmas but will have to return some things due to weight restrictions and redundancy. 
The countdown is unofficially official.
