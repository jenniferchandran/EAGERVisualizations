Devil Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527375,"For 3 years now I have attempted to plan a AT Thru Hike.
2014. Retirement, adjustment in life and death of parents changed plans.
2015 Death in family, 2 weeks later end up sick and in hospital. Guess better then on trail. 
2016. 5 or 6 surgeries since September 2015, no gym, and now a lot more added pounds!!!!!! Over weight and now totally out of shape except round!!! Lol. So being in this condition cancelled plans for 2016.
Loss of two airfares and a shuttle! But that is what it is!! 
See what the future brings",,As far as I can go,"Mar 11, Fri",0

Devil Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527320,"Fast foward to April 2016 
WTF am I thinking. The Dr. cleared me to get back in the gym with no restrictions a few weeks ago. But we know how hard it is to start back after 6 moths! 
Well now it's a few weeks late later. I'm thinking its time try. I will take it slow and easy, sure many other hikers will pass me! But I always have said and believed the ""only failure if life, is the failure to try! While I know from the stand point of many, this is the worst time to try, that I should wait and get in shape. But I'm willing to do low miles and suck it up. I know I can't and I'm not trying to impress or keep up with anyone. But thinking the time has come to clear the head, loss some weight and get back my fighting spirit!!!!! Many of long timed planning and in shape hikers have failed, but some out of shape and last minute hikers, some how made it!! While I may and probably won't make it all the way to the BIG K. I want and will hike till my hike is done. HYOH",,As far as I can go!,"Apr 08, Fri",0
Devil Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527287,"Shit is getting real. Flight booked, Shuttle and first night in Hiker Hostel set up. Can say the anxiety level is building!!!!!!! WTF am I thinking. I see some short mile days for a week or so LOL Done long hikes and military humps. But that was a long time ago and a lot less fat!!!!!!!!! One foot in front of the other. One day at a time. Not a race, It's the journey that matters. No matter how long or short. It's more than sitting on the couch and more than most will even try. Just have to keep telling myself that. Right? LOL",,As far as I can go!,"Apr 09, Sat",0

But this may never come along again. More than one person has went through it and I can't leave to much behind. Plus I do want some comforts.

Devil Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527840,"Well trying to pull this together in just a few days is not working well and hard to pull off! LOL I am toast.   To much to do and not enough time.   Really did not do all I wanted to do. But I will figure it out and deal with it. Frustrated that still can get pack weight down.   Plus trying to fit everything. Granted I have some luxury items, but they are small. Will have to readjust everything in GA. Had to close up box to ship and worry about it later!!!    Spent to much time running around today and at DVM renewing Drivers licence, ect. Over the years I have packed many packs! But tonight I'm just done and cant get it set up right. To think I would throw together a pack to go to the feild in a 10 - 15 minutes and thought nothing of it    Well that's it for tonight",,As far as I can go,"Apr 14, Thu",0
Devil Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527842,"LEAVING ON A PLANE TO GA WITH A ONE WAY TICKET                                                                  I am leaving on a plane with a oneway ticket to GA. To say that I am apprehensive and nervous, would be an understatement. Of all the years or times I could attempt this, this has to be the worst timing! After 6 months of being restricted to what I could do. I am heavier (AKA: FAT) and more out of shape then I have ever been!!!! But think the time has come. Physically and mentally it’s time.     I will be heading to the southern terminus of the Appalachian trail (AT) on Springer Mt., GA Some basic Appalachian Trail Facts:    1. The AT runs 2189.2 miles from GA to ME. Over 5 million steps     2. Travels through 14 states. GA, NC, TN, VA, WV, MD, PA, NJ, NY, Ct, MA, VT, NH and ME    3.   The AT is marked with approximately 165,000 2 x 6 inch white blazes along the trail    4. The elevation gain/loss of hiking the entire Appalachian trail is the equivalent of climbing Mt Everest 16 times   5. Since the 1936 (year of 1st reported thur hike by Myron Avery) little over 15,524                                  .       people have completed all of the trail. Thru hikers and section hikers (2000 milers) combined.    6. Place to most likely to see a bear on the AT?   NJ   7. The dropout rate is about upwards of 25 percent in the first 30 miles ( Neels Gap)   8. Only 25 percent report completing the AT in a year. That number includes section hikers, those who have done it over time, Not in one season of hiking. So really about 15 to 20 percent.So basically it’s almost impossible to complete in one season! Let alone for me!!!!! LOL    That being said! I am not stating I will be hiking 2189.1 miles and climbing MT. Katahdin (northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail) anytime soon! LOL That way no one can call me failure or bust my balls for not making it all the way. LOl    But I will be stepping off on the April 15 and see how far my out of shape and fat ass can make it.   The hardest thing is going to be missing the boys.   But if I make some decent miles, they will benefit too. Jaime and the boys will be meeting up with me in between. At the end of the hike, no matter how long or short it is. I will be in better shape all the way around.   (Fixed, broken or dead LOL)    Worse case scenario I will be like a Ford, except I will be FOTD! Found On Trail DEAD! LOL      While I know not everyone will understand or even try to understand why I would want to attempt taking a long walk in the woods. Especially being this overweight and out of shape. But it is what it is! I know “How can a Daddy leave his boys for a few weeks or longer”, right!    One of the most important people in my life is 150% supportive of this and is pushing and hoping that I complete a thru hike. Jaime (Loving Wife) is willing and supportive of me going all the way! She will be my ground control for this adventure. And that’s what really matters. If the end result is a clearer head, less weight and in better shape. I should be in better health, Which will make be a better husband and father. Maybe even be have a healthier and longer life!   I also have several friends who are supportive of it and willing to help out on the home front, with my lawn Ect. and whatever else comes up around the house.  To answer some of the common questions.Yes I will be sleeping in the woods. Shelter, tent Hostel or stealth!Yes I will be shitting in the woodsNo I am not carrying a gun. WHy? Not needed and too much extra weight LOLNo will not shower everyday only when I hit a Trail town or hiker hostel.Yes I going by myself. Will meet others along the way.Fears? Failure and injury , missing the boysYes I should see some bears! I hope lol One of the biggest questions is why???Why notBecause I think I can.In part because I’ve wanted to do this for about 25 plus years, I have been intrigued for many years and dreamed of trying it. I’ve read a shit load of the books and followed other hikers journals over the yearsTo recharge and reassess: Having done shorter hikes (a few weeks) being out there helps to you reassess your life, remind you of what life’s priorities really are and basically it cures what ails ya. Rebuilds your belief in people!.30 plus years of emergency services. Fire, EMS, Police and Military! Get in better shape and loss the weight.Lastly a few too many curve balls the last few years. Nuff said! LOL Everyone has their own method of dealing Anyone wishing to keep track of me and or offer some words of encouragement can follow me on Facebook. I’m not sure how often will post, but will post when I can.  I will be carrying a InReach Explorer that allows me to send and receive text messages via satellites. When I send a message it will contain a link of my location. When hitting on the link you can pull up a map and it will show in detail my location. Also have MapShare set up. It will show my location as long as my Inreach is on. I tried it and it was within a few feet. At least they will know where to find my body.

Devil Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527963,"Well day one is slowing down. Hiker TV on . Took truck keys with me to airport. Oops hidden key knife. Think they questioned it?   So first gear malfunction, pack zipper broken. 2nd malfunction Protective screen for phone cracked. After walking to REI and almost getting new pack, I was able to get it fixed at The Hiker Hostel.   Folks here are great. Did pack explosion. Can save around 4 pounds. Pulled some things so will see tomorrow what else I pull out. Pack is currently 36 lbs without food and water.   Few other hikers are at that with everything.   Bastards. Lol. Had a great day with some great folks from all over. Thinking ""DOC"" is going to stick, lots of prior Navy here today.   Steak, potatoes, corn and some cold beers.. still wondering WTF im thinging!!     Live love, laugh and hike.",,As far as I can go,"Apr 14, Thu",0
Devil Doc,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528132,"Well i can say that the extra day at the hostel was worth it! Folks here are great. Duffy fixed my pack yesterday and so far is as good as new. Got caught up on some sleep and got to spend a little time setting up my pack and relaxing. Got the weight down to about 36 lbs with 5 to 6 days of food. May end up at about 42 lbs with water. Better than the 50 plus i was at. Still want to switch out sleeping bag and rain jacket when i find ones that fit my fat ass and weight less. Went up to Amicalola Falls and set off Gary aka: Burn Man. He is from Canada via Ireland. Great guy wish I was hiking with him. Maybe our paths will cross again. Registered for my hike. It's official I am Amicalola Thur Hikee number 1515. Hiker midnight has passed. Morning comes early. So time to crash.             Live, love, laughter and HIKE. DEVIL DOC",,As far as I can go,"Apr 15, Fri",0
