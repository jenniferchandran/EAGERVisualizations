Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535142,We were able to do alot of miles today because we had food on our minds. We didnt get much sleep last night because we camped on the hill above the shelter. It was a lovely perfect flat spot but it was almost too good to be true. Around 11 I was woken up by Gray shining a flash light out the tent flap. I had slept through the first of what would a long night of bear and animal arrivals. Laying there our tent seemed become pretty mesley compared to solid walls. The bear did return but was quickly spooked off by our siren device. The deer on the other hand did not fear anything and proceeded to linger breathe while chewing extremly loud. We woke early to get a good start to our day. While coming down McQueens knob we heard the similar cracking and snaping in the brush. A small bear was standing on his hind legs peeking over a log checking us out. Not too bad to see a bear from afar.,"Double Springs Shelter

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535168,Today we decided to sleep in and have a zero. Our choice of hostel fit our needs with a hot shower and great company. Chuck the owner of the Woodchuck Hostel was extremly helpful and kind. Hazel helped us figure out our calorie situation. So hopefully now we will have more energy during the long days of hiking ahead. We stoped in to the Mt. Rodgers outfitters to get some advice on better quailty shoes. I found out I have been in the wrong size for the past 400 miles We treated ourselves to burritos at Hey Joes to end a perfect rest day. Tomarrow we shall leave Damascus with fresh rested bodies and minds.,"Damascus, Va

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535751,We woke up early today to get everything cleaned up and organized. Normally when we spend an evening in town its hard to get up and going. It must have been fate because when we were at the post office sending ourselves a few things ahead Dusty our trail friend had arrived. One cold rainy day on the trail we had tea at the shelter with him. Perfect and just what we needed! He had been a bit behind us because he nursing a foot injury. We had a perfect breakfast with him while catching up. He was getting his foot checked out because he thinks its may be broken. Send good vibes his way in hopes its not broken. So we bid adue and headed back onto the trail. We didnt get started till about 1230. There was a few climbs in our day but nothing too crazy. We crossed the Virginia Creeper trail a few times and that was a really nice trail. Great to see families out together fishing and riding bikes. It was dark when we hit the shelter but 14.5's not a bad day.,"Damascus, Va

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535838,"After today I felt nothing would stand in our way. Except maybe sore tired feet. The new shoes are really helping but breaking them in makes for some grumpy feet. We were trying to make it past the shelter in th Grayson Highlands. The first climb of the morning we went up about 2000 feet in about 4 miles. So its really hard to keep up a steady pace because of constant change in terrain. Mainly the rocks get to me. I started the hike with a slight pain in my hip that only really got worse while going uphill mostly all day. We took a break at Buzzard Rock. There are a bunch of weekend hikers and day hikers out because of the Memorial Day weekend. We didnt see a fellow through hikers all day. We were coming down the other side of the mountain and ran into Skinny Man a section hiker that does interviews with thru hikers. He was from Wilmington,Nc and his youtube page is Chasing thru hikers. So look for our interview in future updates. At the bottom of the mountain there was trail magic waiting for us. 2 ice cold coolers full of sandwhichs, pickles, plums, beer, and pepsi. It dosent seem like much but it makes your day to rest and share a sandwhich that a special someone left for you. We continued on to the parking lot where there was a real bathroom and a trash can! Its the little things that excite us now. We continued our day climbing Mt. Rodgers. We made it to where the trail seperates to the Mt. Rodgers sumit trail and took a break at the shelter. There was tents everywhere sprinkled along the trail. It warms my heart to see people camping and enjoying the outdoors. However, with more crowds comes a litterd busy trail. We pick up so much trash it was crazy. There was an area that opened up and a herd of wild ponies were grazing right next to the trail even a few colts running around enjoying life. Gray and I were surrounded by ponies when we looked at each other and commented how extremly lucky we were. The trail continued from a dirt trail to rock climbing including the fatmam squeeze. Where you squeeze through a rock tunnel. We tented right outside the Grayson Highlands fence because we ran out of daylight. Even though we didnt quite make the miles we wanted to we felt like today was a great day.","Lost Mountain Shelter

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535842,We woke up to rain hitting our tent this morning. So we kind of decided to sleep it out. Which was perfect because when we did wake up again the rain had somewhat stoped and the tent was getting dry. We were camped close to a parking lot and it was pretty funny seeing the herds of people going home because a little rain. I looked around for some water to make breakfast and tea. A really nice guy gave us the rest of his water and we didnt have to purify it! We packed up quickly and started on our way. Grayson Highlands State Park was really beautiful but very rocky. The first stream we came to we refilled our water and quickly made it to the shelter on the opposite side of the park. We took a break at the shelter and a ponie was hanging around begging for some food. There was a double sided ladder we had to climb to get over the barb wire fence.The areas outside the park were extremly muddy. I was rock hopping to cross a particularly muddy spot when I sliped and went crashing down. I hit my elbow pretty hard but I will probley only have a bruse. Gray was there to help me up. Mainly rocky terrian all day. Which mainly means if its rocky I go slower to make sure I have good footing. Gray and his strenth came to my rescue again when I was holding onto a tree trying swing around the tree from rock to rock. Easy task with no weight on your back. I did the heave and swing while the weight in my pack shifted pulling me back to where I started. Gray looked back and saw me hanging there with a sincere cry for help. He easily grabed my pack and helped get upright. I dont know what I would do without him. We made it into camp early my feet were hurting and Grays getting a bad cold. Time for some rest! We got word that our hiker friend Dusty got an xray and his foot is not broken! Just over strenched his ligaments. Our trail frind M&M has to get off the trail for a month because she broke a bone in her foot. Sending best wishes her way for a healthy recovery and safe return to thebtrail!,"Before the Grayson Highlands Gate

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535987,We camped out below the shelter because the shelter was .1 off the trail. Not too far but far after a long day. Gray didnt sleep well at all due to his cold. So we had to get into town so Gray could rest up. We climbed alot today but wow the views made it really worth it. There was a really beautiful we stoped and just took some time to watch the falls. Almost half of the day we could smell people grilling somewhere off the trail. It was easy to get into town there was a really nice guy that picked us up. Now it istime to rest and hoping Gray feels better tomarrow. I hope everyone took sometime out of there weekend to reflect on the real reasons of Memoral Day.,"Hurricane Mtn Shelter

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536027,Gray woke up feeling a little bit better hes still coughing a bit but not as bad. We slept in super late which felt really nice. If you need to go anywhere here around town you can just call the local transit. Only 50 cents per ride which it perfect so we didnt have to walk all the way across the town. We went to the post office to pick up our package and some letters. As always we were hunrgy so we stoped in this cute gift shop that makes sandwhiches. It was perfect and exactly what we wanted. There is nothing to eat around the hotel but fast food. Camping and making trail food gets old after a bit and we crave fresh real food. The gift shop had cute stuffed animals I got an elephant for Libbys new baby girl. We took the bus back to the laundry mat and now we have clean clothes to wear. The bus driver even told us that the bus will take us back up to the mountain. Perfect its extremly hard trying to catch a ride out of town. If we were trying to hitch a ride people dont know there is the Appalachain trail near by. They think normally your a bum and speed past us. We came back to the hotel and just rested the rest of the day.,"Marion, Va

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536285,"Today I slept in until 9 and Gray got up at 10 something. Seems like Grays cold is getting better but he still has a nasty runny nose plus a wicked cough. We had our usual Apple cider, honey, and tea combo. It helps clean out the kidneys and just makes the body feel better. We took the bus to the post office again to send all of our cold weather gear home. Just our luck we will need it again lol. We went to a Japanese resturant and we ate a bunch of food. I had the sushi lunch and Gray had habatchi. After we took the bus to Food City and did our resupply for the next 4 days. We had to increas Grays calories he was skinny to begin with and was loosing too much weight. He goes through about 25 to 30 bars in 4 days. I watch him eat a ton and he still looses weight. I dont like the whole shopping part but I love organization afterwards. I love to organize and make everything perfect plus im a huge planner. A planner to the point where if my plan gets messed up I stress out. This hike is helping me go with the flow and be okay with no plan at all. Now its time for a nap! ?","Marion, Va

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536288,"Well we were planning on getting back on the trail today but that didnt happen. Grays still coughing and has a runny nose. So the cure for that... sleep, food, and nothing else. Normally I cant sleep in or need to be doing something so I dont feel like I wasted a day. Rest is important though. We left once to get lunch and we have been naping and laying around all day. The hotel had to install curtains which requies them to drill loudly into the wall. Thats why we went to lunch so they could do our room. Gray got a sleeping quilt to replaced the sleeping bag he has. He hulked the zipper open and bag needed to be replaced. We also got a Insight emergancy GPS. So in the unlikely event that something goes sour we will be safe.","Marion, Va

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536522,"Well we hit the trail again feeling well rested. We missed the 11 shuttle back to the mountains so we then had to wait for the 2 shuttle.The shuttle pick up was infornt of walmart so we were entertained people watching. It was so loud and people were acting a fool. Reminded me why I enjoy the quiet of the woods. We actually got picked up by a guy named Jim who gave us a ride back up the mountain. Didnt start hiking till like 230. The terrian was okay at first but then the rocks came. The rocks by themelves are ok bit its a hard combo with rocks and a steep incline. Today was mostly hiking straight up a few mountains. We crossed a few roads and alot of open fields. By the end of the day we hitba level patch and that felt nice. After alot of rest my hip and feet started to ache. A day has not gone by without some ache or pain just have to take this trip one step at a time. We came to a major hwy and were greeted by a motel from a murder movie (Flickering light included) and a trucker gas station. We decided to get a room and had a hearty dinner of gas food snacks. We sat around talking to the other thru hikers here Tim, Dusty, and snow white. So tired and sore today but one step closer to our goal.","Marion, Va

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536607,"We got up early and packed everything up to hit the trail after breakfast. We walked down to the Barn resturant and had a hearty breakfast with Dusty. After we had one hour before we had to check out. We layed down for a nap planning on checking out at 11. Well we fell asleep amd woke up at 1. The desk clerk was nice and automaticlly rolled us over another night. My hip was extremly sore so I iced it today. Then fell asleep and didnt wake up till 5. Snow White, Dusty, Gray, and I walked the Mexican Grill. It started to poor while we ate. After we ate we sat and talked a bunch. The rain came pouring down like crazy. A nice day to get out the rain and nap.","Atkins, Va

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537464,"Finally got back on the trail. We took Dusty out for breakfast and stuffed ourself with food. It was called the 2x4 with 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, 2 pieces of sausage, hash browns and toast. Thats a lot and I finished every bite. Plus I didnt feel over stuffed is this what they call the hiker hunger. We left the resturant and hit the trail. Passed under the overpass and off the road into a pasture. Today we passed through a bunch of fields that are owned by a bunch of private owners. That normally means we have climb over a bunch of stiles. Thick ladders that cross over fences or barbed wire. Takes me a bit go over them Gray thinks my preformance is priceless. So instead of dodging roots and rocks we were dodging cow pies. We hit the forest again and soon came to a climb. We were both discussing great sandwhich ideas when we heard a distinct rattle. In a moment I jumped a foot in the air high steping (like that would help) all the while bGray was pushing me foward. A funny scene for anyone who would have seen. When we got a good distance away from the rattle we turned around and not even 5 inches from where my foot was an American rattle snake. He had 7 rings on his tail plus he was really wide. That gave us the extra boost to the top of the mountain. The last climb of the day was tough but we passed the 1/4 way sign. Put a smile on my face I felt very acomplished. After today we only have 1630.5 miles to go. I say bring it!","Atkins, Va

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537471,"june 7I love hiking with Gray because no matter how tough or easy the day is I get to share it with him. I woke up to my usual alarm which is Grays watch. That dosent bother me a bit what does is he never seems to hear it or wake up to it. If any alarm goes off im up lol So I let Gray sleep in which means we started our day at 930 but with us both moving sluggish we didnt hit the trail till 1030. Coming out of the shelter we went down for a bit then came a not so bad hill. Which means its short only because your hiking straight up. After crossing a bridge over a heavy flowing creek we took a bit of a break. 2 beautiful black and blue butterflys landed on Grays pack. Gray saw a water snake down where there was a split in the creek. This whole day was a steady climb up with a slight down just to get your hopes up. We were at the point on the trail where it was flat for .1 mile. I looked ahead about 25 feet a head of us a bear ran across the trail. I made the comment that it must have been a cub because it seemed really small. Not soon after the bear ran across our path 2 actual cubs were hot on her trail. So we saw a mama and her 2 cubs as the coast was clear we contine walking ahead and Gray stops. To our left where the mama bear ran from was a 3rd cub looking for food paying no mind to the fact that his ma had took off without him. He came up to trail about the same distance as before. Gray whistled and the cub stood up on his hind legs looking at us then took off. The miles slowly went by and we just decided to have a slow day. It was perfect we suned in a field of wild flowers, stoped to look at plants we could find. Gray found 3 bunches of chicken of the woods (a mushroom). We made it to the shelter and its really nice. 4 walls and an actual door. We set up our tent and made some tea. We may not have done the miles we wanted but we had a fun simple day together. Looks like we may be in for a windy night.","Knot Maul Branch Shelter

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537474,"Tryed to make up the lack of miles yesterday. It was a very windy night. The tent shook a lot but I slept well. Convinced Gray to get up early and we hit the trail by 9. We had an instant down hill where we had a chance to fill up our water. Very few water sources in the upcoming miles. We had a pretty steep climb but then we were on a ridge line for a good 4 or 5 miles. We met 2 section hiker and got to chat witb them for a little while. They have been doing sections since 2001. Their trail name is Team Slow Poke. Its 2 sisters in there 60's. They were slack packing (go to camper at the end of the day). After we bid farewell and set onto another 4.5 miles of a slight up then a drastic downhill. At the bottom we took a break at the shelter. Team Slow Poke was there stressing out about there pick up site. The there was supposed to be a road where the husband was supposed to meet them. Come to find out they had an old trail map and the forest service road was no longer kept up. Gray showed them on the Garmin the way they had to go to meet up with there ride. We offered to walk them to the forest service road but they insisted they would be fine. The next section went straight up then a smooth trail. Like too good to be true smooth trail. We continued down and passed over a bridge to service road 615. The water had a beautiful cascade of falls. We set up camp up the hill. We had enough daylight to refill water, make tea, eat, and enjoy a fire that Gray made. Perfect!","Chestnut Shelter

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537661,When we woke this morning it was crazy cold. Like abnormal for June. That being said the only reason we were able to get up early was because today is a town day. I was up first and after a little provoking plus hot tea Gray emerged from his sleeping bag. I have to keep my eye on him because if i dont hear him deflate his sleeping pad it means he didnt actually get up. I could see my breath thats how chilly it was. As we steped off for the day the sun came over the mountain and started to warm us up. The first 1.9 miles was up hill but the hatchbacks made it super easy. We came around a corner and heard a russle beside us. There was a female deer staring right at us. We stoped to watch her she just watched us. She was so beautiful and not afraid of us at all. We also found a little bunny he froze too and we got super close before he hopped off. We took a short break at the top. Gray said its funny how im faster going up hill then down it took us less then a half hour to cover 1.9 miles uphill. It was probley because I had a smoothy on my mind. There was a lot of ups and downs but they all came with a smooth trail. Also you could beat the great views. Finally we made it to a gravel road that lead to the North secenic highway. I was worried for a bit because about 2 miles out you could see and hear a big nasty 4 lane highway. Now we just jad to get a ride 3 miles down the road to a hot shower and food. Steven a old navy veteran picked us up and gave us a ride to the big walker motel. Now normally a motel has a gross feel to it but this place was super clean. It even smelled clean. We droped our gear and went across the road to the gas station where they happened to have a Dairy Queen. We ate and I got a strawberry smoothy. Yum! Now its shower and rest time.,"Laurel Creek Campsite

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537669,"Today I had another lesson in patience. Its funny because Gray and I had diffrent reasons for wanting to hike the Appalachain trail. However, we are both learning patience. Its the capacity to accept or tolerate delay without getting angry or upset. Gray he has patiene with me because im not a fast hiker. He insists on me leading and doesnt get upset when I cant make a ton of miles. I have patience when Gray gets up late and insists on taking another day off. I was all packed and ready this morning to hit the trail. That didnt happen. Instead we went to the post office. On the way out we ran into Tune up, The Butcher, and Water Bug. Tune Up we havent seen since we left the Smokies. Tune Up and Water bug were both Marines. We chatted for a bit. Thenbwent to the grocery store to get snacks. Then we ate lunch at the local diner. I got new socks that are super fuzzy and soft for that comfort item at the end of the day. We got dollar facial packets and had strawberrys with nutella. Super yummy.

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538180,Hitting the trail again after some nice rest. We were droped off where we hitched a ride from on the North Scenic HWY. Mostly not very nice views at all. A busy fast freeway on one side and a semi fast hwy on the other. This area was probley my least favorite. For a small bit we were walking with rusty barb wire to the left and the guard rail to the right. Eaither way it was a risky walk. We came to the end of that portion and the trail literly droped off out of no where. Even when you got close to the edge it was pebbles and slate that just shifted. Risky business. Once we crossed the road we walked over the highway and searched for our next white blaze. Once we re-entered the woods there was a ton paths that went everywhere. Kind of looked like a hobo hang out and not the Appalachain trail. Gray found the right path. Our only goal today was to make it to the top of the big mountain about 15 miles. Lots of ups and downs even passed 2 shelters. A deer ran up to us really close stoped stared at us. Then Gray said what are you looking for and then the deer bolted away. Made me chuckle like that deer was dared by his fellow friends to buzz by humans. At Lickskillet Hallow we stocked up on water before climbing our big mountain. We walked till about sunset and set up right on top of a ridge with just enough room for our tent. Plus we got to watch the sunset.,"Bland , Va

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538181,Woke up this morning with a full house. A family of Daddy long legs moved in and decided that under our rain cover would be the best spot to live. Im talking about 6 and they were of all diffrent colors amd sizes. When fetching the bear bag I saw Jack another hiker we haven't seen since before the smokies. While I was making breakfast I noticed that a bright green spider had made a web across our tent poles. He even had enough time after to catch a fly and even another bug. Sadly I had to destroy the masterpiece cant have a roge spider in my pack every ounce counts lol. Since we stealth camped on top of a ridge the start to our day went down. We ran out of water after breakfast but it was cool out. At the bottom of the mountain there was a really nice creek. It was nice enough to swim in but we had alot of miles still to cover. There was a pretty cool swinging bridge that we crossed over. It was a really smooth walk for a better part of the day. We climbed up a small hill and found a really nice lake thays not in the book. Plus the shelter we passed soon after had a very dark vibe. We didnt stop because I gave me just a weird feeli. Near the end of the day we had a bigger climb. It wasnt too bad just kind of slow going. We were walking and in front of us was a deer smack dab in the middle of the trail. I could tell it was a doe because behind her was a fawn struggling to keep himself still. We froze and watched the doe run to our right but then quickly run back to the left. As we stood there she hid the fawn and the ran up closer to us as if to say follow me and leave my baby alone. She was such a beautiful deer. We made it to the top of the mountain and a radio tower. After a short talk we continued on to find a spot to camp. That took us down for a bit. Gray went ahead to scout out a spot. I told him to come back and save me once he found a spot. I was just joking but he actually came back up to walk with me the rest of the walk to camp. Hes such a gentleman. We had a nice flat spot and Gray made us a really nice fire. Another great day!,"Campsite on ridge

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538185,Woke up early before the sun. It was pretty chilly and a bit windy. It took forever for Gray to finally get up. I even caught him sitting up and sleeping. I would have let him sleep in but today was a town day. We left camp about 8. We had 2 ups and about 3 major downs. So I thought we were making great time. I left Gray walk ahead because he get pretty adgitated if I walk slow on a town day. We experinced an oh no moment. One so bad that Gray insisted I buy him dinner tonight. We passed the last shelter of the day and the 2nd to last water source. I told Gray we would fill up at the next spot. Sadly when we made it to the next spring it had dried up. We made it to the powerline and took a small break. We only had 5 miles left to the town. Well it was about noon and boy we were thirsty. About 2.7 miles we came to a sign of a spring not marked on our map. We celebrated and both filled up. After we drank about 1.5 litres of water. Our guardian angels were watching over us today. We met a really nice retired Marine named Lee and hiked with him the rest of the afternoon. Lee told us that the lake we passed yesterday and also the shelter were the site of where 2 men were shot and a another couple were murdered. Thats too bad. We came to Angels rest view it was like a perch over the city of Pearisburg. Lee gave us a ride into town where we got a room at the Plaza Motel. We met up Dusty and Tron. Now time to rest and thank our lucky stars!,"Campsite in the forest

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538187,June 14We took another zero. I tried to sleep in but I was up with the sun. We finally got up and going. The first stop was the post office to pick up some new gear and a care package. The man at the front desk told me that since 2 of our packages were sent from Amazon the local motels signed for them. Post offices are not allowed to sign for packages from Fedex of UPS. So we had to find our two packages. Each motel had a package it was kind of like a hunt. When finished we hit up the local chineese buffet it was half off tuesday! After eating we went to the hiker outfitters to get more fuel. The owner was such a lovely lady. We found a full thing of fuel and got it for free xbecause it was in a hiker box. Plus I was going to buy a new tooth brush but she gave it to me for free. After returning to the post office we explained we were still miss a care box. It was found after a few minutes of searching. A worker found it under the name family not williams. We shared a good laugh. Thanks to Grays sister Katie and the whole family for the snacks they sent to us. Now we are just resting and getting ready for our next strech. Its much longer distance between towns. We are also doing research to Aquablaze through the Shenandoah National Park. Mainly to break up the long days of hiking.

The map and I have Gray set on staying out for a longer period of time between towns. I told him if he wants to eat at The Homeplace we need to make it there by Sunday. The Homeplace is a home style cooking resturant that serves you big ole dishes of food family style. SIGN ME UP! So we managed to make it to the trail by 1130. We are both super weighed down with food and water. The water supplies are very spread out in this section which means we are carrying more weight in water. I normally drink about 1.5 liters a day but today was a hot one. I drank about 2 liters not to include what Gray and I shared in juice. Whenever we hit a water supply we fill up a liter bottle and share it between the 2 of us. Plus wheb it comes from the springs its super cold. Great for a hot day. We went up a majority of the day the first 6.9 were climbing up the diping down. The first small hill was not to bad but the 2nd was torture on the legs. To make it worse a good sectiob of the trail ran next to the land fill. We were not up wind of it at all. Boy our trash really reaks plus it dosent help its trash in the baking sun. We met a few section hikers that just started today. They had a black dog with them made me miss my pup. Once we made it to the shelter we had a smoother walk for the day. Oh and before the last big mountain we ran into Lee again, the guy that gave us a ride into town a day back. All was going well after the shelter we filled up our water at the last spot for 11 miles. Not even 45 minutes later we hear a big long roar of thunder. We have just enough time to put our rain covers on before the rain started. It was a light rain simple to cook you down but then the sun went away. It got dark and the rain started to pour, the winds shifted often to soak us really good. We had a slipt second choice pop up our tent or walk out of the storm. We were already soaked so it made no sence to get the rest of our wet so we comtinued walking. The rain came down like in the Whinnie the Pooh movie. I couldnt help but sing the tune in my head. It didnt take long for the trail to become a river. So now we were soaked and had squishy shoes yet we walked on. It didnt take long for the rain to die down then stop. The sun had found us again. We met a fellow hiker from Germany he had a black lab mix with him as well. All these dogs make me miss my pup. We stoped at the last camping sight for the next 5 or so miles. Gray made us a super nice fire to warm up and dry our clothes. Now I have to look and see if the warenty for Darn Tough socks cover fire because Grays got a bit too close. As the sun was setting we sat next to the fire and saw a ton of lightening bugs. Remined me of all the fun times when I was little trying to catch them. Now time for bed and hoping for no more rain.","Pearisburg, Va

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538716,As most can see plans changes. We had a bunch of bad storms last night. There was once that I woke up and felt like the rain would push through a side of the tent. The sun never really came up. It rained into the morning. I asked Gray if he wanted to get up and he said lets sleep out the rain. Its weird how in hotelsbI cant sleep in but in the woods I can sleep in super late. When I got up at 10 the rain had somewhat stopped. We were slow going and most of the people we saw and passed yesterday had already caught up to us. We talked about our options for the day. Gray is not a rain person. I wanted to keep going but we agreed to hike the 7 miles to the road then slack pack tomarrow to catch up. The terrain was super easy there was one really tough up incline. All in all a soggy day but we ended it with a plan to slack pack tomarrow.,"Campsite before Shelter

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538717,With a long day ahead of us we started out to the trail by 8. With the drive to the road near Newport we made it out to the trail by 845. Today we were slack packing 21.7 miles to the next road. Without packs we were able to keep up over 2.5 miles per hour. We were doing super well and I was so proud of myself. It rained on and off all day. We went 15 miles before 4 then we came to a bad section of trail where the rain made it into a giant slip and slide. Not a fun one like a giant murderous slip and slide that will shoot you down the mountain. Then came the horrendous rocks. Not a rock here and there but the trail is nothing but rocks. Rocks that are slippery and that move a ton. It was never ending and took us forever. We came to a clear patch which was exciting but then around the next turn was an even worse patch. I have never felt so defeted. Ill admit I stood there and shead a few tears then continued foward. We made our goal and now time time for a warm shower! Plus we found a ton of chicken of the woods (A mushroom). We harvested a baggie full and plan to cook it later. By the way it was super yummy!,"The Captains

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539080,June 18Not too bad of a walk today. We started out in a lot of farm fields. There was a random chimney next to the trail out of no where. May have been an old chimney to a house thats no longer there. Quickly into our hike we passed the 2nd largest tree on the trail. Ofcourse we couldn't pass it without stoping so Gray could climb it. It is over 18 feet around and 300 years old. It is offical we have crossed the Eastern Continental Divide today. We were on a ridge for a majority of the day. The Audie Murphy monument was really nice. I never knew this but he was the most decorated American Solider of WWII. Not too bad of a day. The trail was really sketchy in a few spots but we survived.,"Newport, Va

This year will be five years since he passed but I know hes with me everywhere I go and in everything that I do. When your days are consumed with hiking it leaves a lot of time to think. I always kick myself for taking that time with him for granted. However, I cherish all the laughs we shared. Today we met a daughter and father that are hiking the trail together. Mainly beacuse her mom didnt want her tohike alone. Thats really cool. Rough hike today. We completed the Dragons back. A good rule is look at your feet. There was parts where the trail had rebarb sticking out the mountain and you hike hand over hand to balance yourself to pass that part. This area called for no trecking poles more like your hands and feet are all you need. We got picked up by the hostel and they took us to the Homeplace. A nice family style resturant where they being everyone out big dishes of mashed potatos, beans, buns, and fried chicken. Such a really nice treat! We shared our meal with another hiker named Casper. After dinner we went back to the Hostel which was a big farm with tons of chickens and Gunnis. We just layed in the grass and talked to Luke. We tried to call Mom to wish her a Happy Birthday.

He literly parked himself outside our tent and did his wakeup call until Gray got up. The owner of the hostel gave us a ride to Va 311 and we put our packs in the truck to be droped off in town. That was so nice we slack packed into town. We made it to McAffe's knob by 9 and it was so nice. We had the whole place to ourselves. Its so cool to for the longest time see this area in movies and books but its unreal to really experience it. We ended up staying up there for an hour. Gray was rock jumping making me all nervous. Finally got him to contine on. We walked on the Tinker cliffs for about half a mile. I almost jumped out of my skin because I saw a big ole rattle snake skin on the ground. Made me extra cautious. In Lamberts Meadow we came smack dab face to face with a male bear. It was bigger then the mother bears that we have seen. The bear id say weighed about 300 pounds. Gray stomped and got big and the bear just stared at us and didnt move an inch. So we resorted to plan B a loudbang in his direction sent him hot tailing it out of there. We were pretty short on water so we kept moving fast. All the streams seemed to dry up. Gray has great ears he found a stream out of nowhere. When we made it to the hotel our usual hiker friends were there. Gray and I changed into somewhat swimming clothes and headed for the pool. I couldn't resist but cannon ball into the pool.

We want to take a week off to rest and inorder to do so we have to increase our miles to Harpers Ferry. We made it in yesterday and somewhat scrambled to organize and get ready to aqua blaze. We using a Excursion 4 a heavy duty blow up raft. Instead of hiking the Shenandoah National Park we will be rafting down the river. Ive never white water rafted before so im super nervous. We got a ride to the local boat ramp and it took us a bit to blow the raft up and get settled. We then launched and came to a quick moving rapids. Gulp.... sink or swim. Well we sure didnt sink but that dosent mean I didnt almsot have a heart attack on mutiple ocasions. Gray has experience with rapids. So he taught me on the go. Lots of fast water and there was 2 ocations where we got pinned ontop of a rock. Gray probley wanted to stangle we because when that happened I went ""code black"" as Gray called it. Which means I was screaming at the top of my lungs like that was going to help while poking the rock with my paddle. I love adventure but water has always been kind of a little fear of mine. I told Gray that I wanted to do Aquablazing to help me over come that fear. After today im thinking maybe I should have started out a bit smaller instead of launching myself into Class 2 rapids. All is well we made it to Island Ford boat ramp. Instead of trying to camp and possibly get a ticket we got a hotel for the evening. I got Gray toco bell for puting up with me today.","Daleville, Va

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540454,">Our legs will rest but boy our arms will be working in over time. I am happy to report that we did not get pinned today! Plus I only went ""code black"" once. All the other times I was screaming inside my head. I did a ton better about controlling my side of the boat and not ramming rocks. Gray did a great job because twice he spun us around a nasty looking rock. We have life vests that we wear all the time. Safety first! Plus for all the ladies out there the life jackets are made now with padding around the bra area so that your tata's will no longer be smashed like boys life jackets. Thanks to the smart person who achieved that! We saw a bald eagle, cows in the water, water snakes, ducks, and birds. Gray was shouting at some birds sitting on a power line and one pooped and it nearly hit us. Toward the end of the day we hit a pretty hard rapids and while moving around a few rocks I hulked my paddle. It busted in half and left me with a half of a paddle. So we limped up to the city of Shenandoah where we have to get out and go around a dam. The sun was beaming in our eyes so we were glad to find shade. We were getting everything organized and another fisherman came up to talk. We told him we were actually hiking the Appalachian trail but now traveling along the water ways. His name was Greg and he was out bass fishing. He caught about 54 or so today. DANG! We told him about our paddle and then he told us what to expect from ahead. Well we parted ways but then Greg came back and handed us a nice non broken paddle. He gave us his extra and we couldn't thank him enough. Keep him in your prayers. Then walking toward the dam right on the ground was a perfect pair of sunglasses. What!!! To top it off on the way further down Gray found 10 dollars on the ground. Plus a,huge patch of tiger lilies my favorite flower! I'm feeling so blessed for the kindness of others and having a great day!","Island Ford Boat ramp

There is supposed to be rain in the forecast but so far its been holding off which is nice. There were a few sprinkles but we welcomed them with open arms because it it hot!!! I think that is one thing you don't really notice while walking in the woods. How much the trees comfort you with their shade. It was funny to see us moving around the lake like Gollum seeking any shade provided. The rapids were much easier today and our boat is taking everything like a champ. There was one section where we had rocks everywhere. However, we managed to make our way through it all with no pinning or lodging our self on top of rocks.

For 25 dollars you can pay the local outfitters to come and take you around it. Very cloudy today but the water was super fast. The dam is I guess a hydroelectric dam. There were tons of cows in the water today and I sure do not blame them because it was another hot one. We saw a lot of people out fishing and tons of family camping around the water. Gray says im odd because the only way I would swim in this water is if I had shoes on. It just creeps me out not being able to see the bottom of the water and having something touch my bare foot. I heard people say they have seen shopping carts in this river and there is no way my poor feet should ever come in contact with that. Plus another huge factor is at the last dam there was a collection box for electric eels. WHAT!!!! EELs .... nope. We will be staying in town tonight because we need and I mean need to do some laundry. Plus its calling for storms tonight and that combined with a rising river sounds scary to me.,"Newport Dam
",Luray Dam,"Jul 03, Sun",19
Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542429,"Skip ahead a few days. Nothing to really report on those days except more sun and less rapids. Today we ended up boating about 19 miles to the Bloomery boat landing. The boat ride there could have not gone any slower. There was hardly any rapids to speak of and lots of sun. I should't really complain because sun is much better then rain any day. We made it to the boat dock 10 minutes after my brother Sam had arrived. It was really great to see him and of course I told him he had to bring our dog Todd. Todd was more confused when he saw us. The look on his face was the look of seeing a ghost. I really didn't know how much I had missed them both till we were reunited again. Todd is a wiener dog and he is so sweet. We are planning on taking sometime off to have a half way break. Plus our gear is in major need of some cleaning. Most people will be continuing on toward Maine. After long talks Gray and I have decided that it will be best to flip up to Maine and hike south the rest of our journey. It will be sad to leave all of our trail friends behind but I want to experience Maine in the summer. Where if I choose to I can swim in the beautiful lakes. Instead of suffering through it during the fall months and worrying we wont make the close of Baxter in time. Sam was kind enough to take us to the Appalachian trail Conservatory so that we could check in for our half way photo. I would like to note that when we left Springer Mtn. GA we were thru hiker 1390 and 1391. If we were continuing North we were hiker 115 and 116 to arrive at the psychological half way point. That number is crazy to me I had thought there would have been so many other people ahead of us. We ended up going into the book as Flip Flop hiker number 43 and 44. It is still a crazy number. It is hard to wrap my head around the fact that we have made it 1023 miles. When I started Springer and took our picture at the top. I was super excited and had a huge smile because after all the planning we had finally started my journey. Now arriving at this point I am full of mixed emotions and feelings. I am truly proud of Gray because I have seen him grow so much and open up about his military career. I am proud of myself for making it this far in our journey. I am also nervous about the miles ahead but I know now that whatever happens I will be ready for it. I feel that walking in the woods has allowed me to reset my perspective on a lot of things in life. It has also allowed me to come to terms and forgive myself for mistakes I have made in my past. I told Gray the other day if I could go back in time to my younger self in my first enlistment. I would tell myself that its okay to be alone. Experience and do things for you. I also told him that I would have wanted to achieve something like this before we were married because I think it would have made me a stronger more independent women. I know that this hike is allowing me to grow with Gray as well. The rugged outdoors has a way of stripping down all those walls that are put up. It has allowed us to learn more about helping each other as well as learning how to be helped. The best advice I was given on the trail so far was from a man whom I called Hot Springs. His name for me every time we met was Iowa Legs. As we were chatting with him one evening he told Gray and I that the key to our success out here was to know that it is okay to have a bad day. However, if one of us is having a bad day the other needs to be the steady rock. In more ways then I can remember we have been able to achieve this. My hopes for the next portion of my journey is that it will bring more challenges physically and mentally. I want to be a steady rock for Gray as well as myself. I know that this journey would not be possible without God protecting us along the way. As well as the love and support that we receive from our family & friends. Now it is time for us to sign off for a bit. Not to worry though we shall be back soon well rested and ready for the second half of our hike.","Luray Dam

Sam droped us off at the airport in Raleigh. We took a quick flight to Dc Regan airport. I have never been to that airport. It was very small so small we took a bus to our plane on the tarmac. While we were laning we flew right over the Pentagon. Last time I saw that was when Sam and I were running the Marine Corps Marathon. We saw the Washington Monument as the sun was setting behind it. When we took off for Bangor Maine there was lightening behind and next to our plane. Made for a bumpy ride for a bit. We landed at 1140 pm and headed to the airport hotel. It amazes me how fast it took us to get here and it will take us 3 months or so to get back. The hotel was fancy we only stayed there because they gave us a huge military discount.

There was 2 section hikers, the May family (finishing the AT), Henry (from Australia), and Blonde Bear. Blonde Bear offer us a place to pop our tent for the evening because I forgot to make a reservation. Duffy gave us a informal brief on what to do and what not to do. Butterflies were going crazy in my tummy as we caught our first view of Mt. Katahdin. We checked in then we were droped off at the ranger station. They have to track us in case of emergancy. We took day packs that smelled like a armpit barf combo. It beats carring a 40 pound pack up to the summit. We took the hunt trail the most safest trail to the top. There was a waterfall so into our hike. I really love waterfalls they are so stunning. The climb was consistantly going up. We transitioned from an inclined path to climbing up rocks. Once we got above the tree line we encountered 2 miles of boulder climbing. I have to admit it was tough. I triped and fell into a prickly bush that got me good in the leg. Gray pointed out later on that i had a nice blood stain on my pants leg. Sure enough Katahdin had left her mark. I stood looking up and straight up all you could see was tiny people climbimg straight up into the clouds. Im so proud of myself because I was not afarid. Once getting over the last boulder that i thought would bring me to the summit I found that it was only the saddle of the mountain. Another walk through what looked like a scene from The Lord of the Rings and then another climb led us to the fam
ous sign. It was super windy and chilly. I was happy but I knew this was not the end of our journey. Getting down was super long. A combination of hopping, sliding, and praying. I tore the pocket on my pants. We gave another hiker a good laugh and show. At one point there is nothing but rebarb between you and 6 feet below you. Picture this me haning from rebarb one leg clining to a rock face and one leg dancing for a foot hold, Im yelling ""Gray am I close"". He chuckles and says not even close. He grabs me to help me ease down and I almost took him out both of us crashing to the ground. The older hiker appalauded and I took a short bow. We lived to mKe it back to the campsite.

As soon as the tent was up it started to rain. Perfect timing. Very early to stop but it was nice to relax for a bit with light left in the day.","Monson, Me

Really flat and easy terrian today. Soon into the start of our day we forded the Piscataquis River. It wasnt too deep at all. Our dirty water blatter burst on us so I guess i got a good drenched cool off. Everyone stopped at the first shelter but we continued on to Moxie Bald. It was 1.2 miles to the mid peak. We took a good break there to pick blueberrys for tomarrows breakfast. Another mile and we were at the top. You could see everywhere. There was even the Bigalow range far in the distance. Going down was slow but fun. There was a lot of rocks and small crevises to hide in. Gray hid and managed to scare me when he poped out from behind the rocks. At the shelter we quickly set up our tent and talked to 2 women out on a section hike. They recommended Pauls B&B so we will have to check him out while passing through Caratunk.,"Random stelth site

Im really trying to work better on my speed vs. distance but these inclines make it pretty tough. At mile 3 I ran out of water and knew it would be 3 more miles to the next water source. The mountain we climbed was called Pleasant Pond Mtn. A guy coming up while we were going down made a comment about it not being so pleasant. At the next water source we filled up water and drank 2 liters of propel. We continued on to the next shelter it was a nice gradual down hill. We passed alot of streams ans brooks. We camped next to a nice brook where the water flow,was great. Plusit gives us a short day into town tomarrow. We walked the river and found 2 nice pieces of slate we will send home to ourselves.

We checked in and Paul quickly took us to the post office. The whole town was suler tiny and the post office looked like an old house. We easily sent the slate home very easily. We went back to Pauls and got a room for 40 dollars. Which is super cheap for North on the trail. We showered,and wore loner clothes while ours was in the wash. We came downstairs and Damian had made it in. Thats great cuz we have no service. Gray and I layed around. He played games on the tablet and I read some of Pauls books. We shared one of Pauls famous milkshakes. Super worth the walk to get here. I talked to Paul for awhile and he was super nice. After Gray and I layed around until our laundry,was done. Then Paul took us to the local Bar and Grill. A lot of tourists here for white water rafting. They also had a pool and a hot tub at the resturant Gray, Damian, Matt (Blues Brother), and I sat around and talked. I had a blueberry beer and it had actual blueberrys in it. For dinner I ate the O'Dilly burger (normally Im not a fan of burgers). It was an 8oz patty with dill infused cheese, dill sause, tomatos, lettuce, and fried pickles to top it off. You better believe I ate every last bite. Matt and I were the only ones to clean our plate. It started to get dark so Paul came to pick us up.

It was served family style. We had water, coffee, organge juice, a huge cheese omlet with rosted mushrooms & parsley, fried potatos, and fresh picked blueberry pancakes. Plus there were blueberry in a but of sugar to place onto p of the pancakes. I had 4 pancakes it was so delicious. After breakfast we helped clean up and then got ready to go. When checking out we couldnt thank Paul enough for being so nice and giving us a quiet place to stay. In a way he reminded me of my dad on how he used to cook and made everyone feel warm and welcome. We were off to the trail by 10ish. We quickly made it to the Kennebec River where you have to cross in a canoe. The river can rise 2 to 4 feet without notice. The 3.7 mile hike was right next to a brook with tons of waterfalls. We made it to Pierce pond and took a break. Damian caught up to us and we ended up talking for an hour. We parted ways soon after we planned to go further on that day. On thdbtrail today we saw a squirrel steal a mushroom from right in front of us then naw on it. Also saw and heard more loons. Watched a wood pecker and almost steped on 2 snakes all in a days walk. Cant forget we picked more blueberrys. Took time to sit on the beach for a bit. We passed a sign informing us we were walking the same path Benidict Arnold took in the war of 1775. Pretty cool history.

It was pretty flat after that until we started to climb Little Bigelow mtn. From the top you could see the very high peaks that we will be hiking tomarrow. The campsite we stayed at was competley packed. We had to make a site next to a big ole rock and a tree. Kind of took our tent from a 3 person tent to a 2 person tent. There were 3 other females out there. You could tell 2 were south bound hikers because how they acted. One almost hit our tent with her bear bag rock.

You walk up to an incline and the next rock is 6 feet above you. The summit was an Alpine ridge you walk along for a long way. The first peak was Avery peak. Then we did some more walking and climbing and made it to Bigelow Peak. There we took a break and picked fresh cranberrys. They are still a little ripe but good to eat. A harsh down climb then a climb up we were at the South Horn mtn peak. There was a drastic 5 miles down hill. I let Gray go ahead to the campsite so he wasnt bored walking.

Once all packed up we put our stuff in the shuttle drivers car then ran and got a deli sandwhich to go. We hit the trail soon after and ate a fresh banana before stepping out. It looked funny but it was so good for the 1st mile or so as the rain was pouring down I drank a cup of coffee. Mind you we were going into a 5.2 mile incline. We passed a lot of people who were on there way down but didnt see anyone going up like us. There was no view at all at the top just fog to greet us at every turn. Maybe it made it easier because you couldnt see the tons of false sumits. It was slow going but I didnt want to slip and fall on the rocks. The last mile or so was rock climbing. I couldnt see anything because I had to pack my glasses away. Foggy glasses are every four eyed persons nightmare. The summit was just a sign no peak just a ton trees. It was Crooket Mtn. south and north peak. The rest of the day was down hill. Down was slower with all of the slick rocks and very deep sharp decline for about 1 mile. We stopped really early at the campsite before a water crossing. We quickly set up because we had a break in the rain. Gray made a fire which was nice to warm us up. A young group of college kids were there with the Maine Conservation Corps. They help fix the trail by clearing downed trees, making stairs, and putting together bog boards. They work the trail all summer and in return they recieve scholorship money for school. We chatted with them till well after dark. For dinner we had our sandwhiches and a mint woopie pie. That is a Maine thing because only in Maine have we seen so many woopie pies. It is 2 round slices of cake with a glob of frosting in the middle. Normally 1 woopie pie has 700 calories in it and is super sweet. Too sweet for my liking thats why we share if we have one.","Straton, Me

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546518,"Well last night was intresting to say the least. A bit after 9 it poured rain well until after 6 this morning. When we set up camp last night it was on a perfectly flat spot. However, after a long night of nonstop rain Gray abruptly woke up and we. realized that water was seeping under our tent. You could push down the tent floor down about and inch. Luckly it didnt seep through. In order to keep our sleeping bag dry our sleeping pad had to become a safe zone. All other floor was lava. If we were to get up and move the tent it would have instantly soaked us and gotten our stuff wet. It was a safe call to just stay put. When we woke up again the bottom of the tent floor was wet but not drenched. It was raining again so we had to pack up in the rain which is no fun. We had to ford a river that was simple yesterday but quickly turned into raging rapids. There was a board between 2 rocks and the water was about an inch below it. Gray replaced some boulders in the water so it was easier to cross. The whole time in my mind I was saying a silent prayer that I didnt loose my balance or trip in this area. I took a deep breath once safely across. At the other bank it was a straight up mudd climb. About a half mile up we ran into the college kids from last night they were working away on building more stairs. They were awesome and made it so much easier. It was a hard climb but we made it to the top of sugar loaf Mtn. We had a treat of a fat juicy orange I had carried from town. We soon passed a bronze plaque and it symbolized the last section completed on the trail. The next was the crest of Spaulding Mtn. Then came the Mt. Abraham trail followed by lone mountain. We hiked nearly till dark we crossed a few roads & a ton of streams. We found a huge patch of Chantrel mushrooms. We went back into the woods and found a nice flat spot to camo for the night.

Got to a late start but made good progress today. Right off we went down hill for a bit then crossed Orbeton stream. Very muddy and you had to make sure you knew exactly where you were stepping at all times. A long climb up to Poplar ridge. We stopped at the shelter and had some juice. We talked to 2 local section hikers. Thought it was odd with gun fire and machine guns going off this morning. A Navy base is really close to here. At the top of Saddleback Jr. you could look over and see the Horn. Which was the next mountain we were coming to. A huge storm was coming in the distance. We ran into Scarfoot. Haven't seen him since after woody gap in Ga. The climb down jr. was slow and very sketchy. The wind and rain made it worse. I tend to slip more on wer roots then rocks. Long way up to the Horn Mtn. on our way up we ran into Blood Man. Havent seen him since Damascus, Va. I think he has taken maybe 2 days off this whole trip. On top of the Horn it was very clear you could see all the way down then up to Saddleback Mtn. All open Alpine ridge walking. While on our way to the Saddle we put our rain jackets back on and picked some blueberrys. The path was clear but the rain made it slippery. In 2 spots there was rebarb placed to help people climb down or up. It was starting to get late and you could see the sun setting over Rangley Lake. As the sun faded the next mile and a half was dangerous slip & slide. I fell 3 times then finally sild a long ways down some sheet rock. Picture a flat rock angled just right and you slide 100 feet down. All you can do is slide a hope you dont land too hard at the bottom. I tore the seat of my pants from sliding so much.

This part of the trail was super nice and well maintained. The first switch back we have ever had in Maine. Once at Hwy four we walked .3 to the Hiker Hut. We were greeted by Catherine & Steven. What a magical place. A huge garden with every kind of flower, herb, and veggies you could imagine. We sat and talked with Catherine for a good hour. Come to find out Catherine's daughter was a Marine who served in Afghanistan the same time as I did at Leatherneck when all it had was a berm and tents. What a small world it is. We had a new water fliter delivered and I got some actual real hiking socks with toes. I have to wear toe socks when hiking because my toes like to fight over space. For the first 1240 miles all I wore was toe sock liners which are super thin. They took us to the Farm Hostel where we met Damian, Carrie, and Jamie. We caught up then got a quick tour of the place. We then walked to get some groceries. I asked Gray if the rip in my pants was noticeable and I got the its not bad reply. What I didnt realize until it was far too late was it was really bad. I had gotten a coffee at the store and it was glass. I ended up dropping it in the middle of the isle. Everyone stoped and stared plus gave the who let this bum in here look. I got an employee and helped pick up the glass bending over mind you with a huge rip in my britches. An older lady cleared her throat as she passed me as if to say you shoukd be ashamed of yourself. I didnt know it was that bad till I had put them in the laundry. Its offical all the towns people of Rangley has seen my britches. Back at rhe farm house we ate, showered, and started laundry. By then the sun was out bright in the sky. I took everything out of my pack and let the air dry it out. The girls and Damian came back from town and we all chatted and soaked up the sun. Later in the evening we all gathered together and made dinner. There was sausage, steak, wild rice, salad, grilled mushrooms. We all ate around the table family style.

Once back and all packed Steven picked us up and took us back to the Hiker Hut. The area here is very lovely and just being here is very calming. We got a little studio room then received a grand tour. All proceeds made here go to children in India that have facial tumors. Steven was a pro athelete and even went to the world cup. However, for years he longed for some purpose. Then 19 years ago he met a brother and sister with facial tumors. He knew what he had to do. He cordinated with surgions and raised money to pay for both kids to get their tumors removed. Ever since then he lives in India for 6 months and 6 months in Maine. He had beautiful AT jewlery for salep plus hand made leather journals. I knew a perfect someone who could use one of these. The books are leather and all paper is handmade from India locals. There is a stream that follows along the whole property. This whole place is off the grid, no cell towers or electricty. There is a bunk house, a studio room, a fort by the stream and a triangle hut. They cook outside as well. They had fresh lentel soup made mostly from the garden. We sat relaxed and took a ton of pictures. They have 7 humming birds that buzzed us a ton. It sounded like Star Wars was going on around us. A few hours later we went into downtown Rangley. Gray and I window shopped at the stores. I got a mini hand carved Loon. We had a coffee at the local coffee shop. Then had great converstaion with a shop owner. I found a perfect pair of slipper socks to replace my fuzzy socks I left in Millinocket. They are whie and navy blue with moose on them. We had a pizza then headed back to our little sancuary. Another hiker had arrived his name is Daypack. We all talked and shared a lot of laughs. I got to hand feed their chipmunk. She even came and sat in my lap. Too cute. I then got to experience the outside shower. It was down by the stream. It had a heating unit and a water pump hook up. It was a really cool experience just me showering in the great outdoors. Soon after it started to rain. So we all huddled and talked on the front porch till after dark.

Had to pack our stuff up and meet at the front office by 8 to get a ride back to the trail. We really wanted to start early because today was going to be a long hard day. We did the Mahoosuc notch today. We were dropped off at the parking lot and quickly started our up hill climb. It was 3.5 miles up. We did pass by a few water falls that were just pouring down the rock face. There was no big sumit once we reached the top of the first mountain just a sign to say follow the trail to the east. The view from Speck Pond was a really nice one. Sadly I did not see any moose. Just some droopings on the trail. At the top of the Mahoosuc Arm you could see for miles. There were alot of rocky mountains and the valley we would soon be walking through. Im glad we went down the arm because going up would have been one long hard nasty mile straight up on wet slick rock faces. It took me forever to make it down to the bottom. We started the Notch around 430. They say the Notch is the hardest 1 mile on the trail because it is a non stop boulder scramble. If your blessed with long legs no worries. However, if your part hobbit it takes some time and a full body workout. What Gray could just walk over I had to climb under or crawl up. It was fun going. I packed my poles away and had fun going into caves and over deep drops. I would say this is not a mile to do alone (Unless your part monkey or Gray). There was one rock that was super smooth and it was 7 feet up the next boulder. There was no way to find grip anywhere. Gray strattled the top boulder and left one leg hanging down. I had to shimmy up his leg until I could reach the boulder he was on to pull myself up next to him. We finally came to the spot where we thought we were done. I took out my poles and we climbed up on the normal non boulder trail. Surpize! We still had 1/4th of a mile boulder scramble. I will admit that did grumble when I saw more boulders to go over. A that point I was sore, beat up, and tired but I knew the faster we went the faster we could be done for the day. It felt like going to the ice cream store excited about getting a huge double scoop fudge waffle cone only to discover the ice cream store is closed. The good news is we surived and can say we have completed it. However, its one of those things that Im positive I would only do once. Theres no point in Climbing Mt. Everest twice.

I got a pair of jeans for the trip im happy to report that before the hike I was a 14 jeans now Im in a size 8 yay! We then just hung out in the room until we all were hungry again. We had our final family style meal. Tomarrow we will all be going our seperate ways. It was lovely and great conversation. I will really miss the companionship of Jamie and Carrie hopefully we catch them again. To end a perfect evening we had a great soak in the hot tub.,"Gorham, NH

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547448,"I am so rested and excited to get back onto the trail. We arrived the afternoon of the 27th to Acadia National Park. Our first stop was to get lobster. A sweet family from Boston recommended a tiny place before you enter Mt. Desert Island. We arrived and quickly were shown a huge cooler of live lobsters. Gray made it easy and said 3 large ones. We saw them squirm on the scale and then they were placed into a net. They went outside into the water. It was a wood barrel over a wood store. The cook would turn the flute to change the temperature of the fire. The water was a salt water mix. Since our lobster were large it took 30 minutes to cook. When the cook took our lobster out they were bright red. We sat down outside and started our treat. It was super tender and amazing. At the, end of things my favorite part was the claws and I felt super stuffed. We didnt do anything after until sunset we went to the lighthouse and got to see it in the last lights of the day. The 28th was our huge tour of Acadia. I got a National park stamp book so I can start collecting stamps. We saw the sandy beach. Then thunder hole which booms like thnder the waves coming into the rocks. We hiked to the Otter cliffs and sat and watched the waves. Toured the stone bridges of the island and much more. This place is so beautiful. The 29th we watch the sun rise ontop of Cadllic Mountain it was really windy but super beautiful. We then drove to Portland Maine. For my birthday we went to Cabela's so I got a new pair of hiking pants. Saw a moose lol in the middle of the Cabelas. We then had crepes at IHOP. I love crepes! Later on we had a Starbucks coffee and went to see a movie. Hell or High water was a great movie. Such a perfect day. Now traveling back to the trail.","Gorham, NH

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548921,Total Trip Miles:1523.7After a long time away an update is here. The last part of our trip has gone by super fast and at the end of the day im tired. This will be a brief review of what we have been up to. On September 1 we went and picked our trail friend Hazel and Storm up for dinner. That was a super nice treat to see them and also get them dinner after they completed the Mahoosuc notch. We could have talked all night but we couldnt keep them up too super late. After the 1st we went into the wildcats. The views of the Presidential range were very clear for us. They say that bad luck normally comes in 3s and I can offically say that has come true for me. While going up on one semi wet morning I sliped and came crashing down foward onto my left knee. It hurt my ego because I had a crowd when I fell. The knee is black amd blue but still functions. So that was bad luck #1. Side note we have been super lucky to have not had any major injuries. While we were up on Mt. Mariah a lady sliped and broke her ankle. We continued our hiking further into the whites. Mt. Washington was totally foged in when we summited it. The appalachain trail skirts all of the sumits so you have to hike extra to sumit the mountains. The best views we got to see and experience was from the declines. Lots of rocks and a majority of your hiking is above tree line. Once we were out of the whites it was a smoother hike. We actually got to walk some switch backs which we havent hiked since virginia. Were now midway in Vermont. We took a day off to go and tour the Ben&Jerrys factory. Got to try a new flavor milk and cookies. We even made a stop to woodchuck cider house. Vermont is super pretty it reminds me of hiking in Virginia. For the next leg of our trip decided to change it up for a bit. We rented a car and have been slack packing. Thats where you only hike with water. Our jumbo packs stay in the car. Were able to hike a ton more miles then our normal pace. Our goal to finish second week of October. We both are still enjoying our experience but are ready to move on to bigger and better things. Who thought walking all day would eventually get a bit boring. In order to change up the pace we visit a historic park. Tons of history to see on the East coast. So back to my back luck comes in threes. #2 My sleeping pad no longer holds air. I had to sleep directly on the ground. It sucks because that means I cant sleep on my sides. A new one is in the plans next town. #3 and hopefully the final streek of bad luck. Last night I left the tent in the dark to use the restroom. I came back in but I guess I hadn't unziped the tent enough because I tripped on the door flap and launched myself into the tent landing right on my glasses. I herd the dreaded crunch. Thankfully I didnt take out Gray in the process. I used my headlamp to inspect the damage. The line that holds my lenses into my frame had broken. There is no way I could go without. If I went on the trail without glasses I probley would end up talking to a bear thinking it was a human. lol There was one other time I walked on the trail without glasses. I started talking to a guy I thought me knew but later on Gray informed me I had been talking to a random HOBO that we actually didnt know. It is now fixed with tape. Today was a long hike but we went and saw the Norman Rockwell Museum. I will try harder to keep everyone well informed!,"Acadia National Park

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549156,Total trip miles:1608.8Happy to give another quick update. Were chugging right along and picking up more miles everyday it seems. The trails have been a bit muddy but the weather has been perfect. Not too hot and not too cold. This is the first place we have had singal in a few days. You can really see that the leaves are starting to change pretty quickly. The oranges are so bright and it is touched with alot of red / yellow leaves. I love fall its such a happy wonderful time of the year. Bring on the pumpkin spice overload! The highlight of our trip in this section has been Stratton Mountain. At the top there was a lovely look out tower where you could see for miles. One way you could see into New Hampshire and the other way you can see into Mass. Then from the tippy top you could see the diffrent color leaves all around. Im happy to report I got my glasses fixed and a new sleeping pad. The good ole knees are sore but still going strong. Gray is as strong as ever. We trying to push 20 plus days now in training for the 4 state challange. Thats where you hike 43 miles through 4 states in one day. Were going to do a practice run through CT because there is only about 45 miles in that state. That will ultimatly determine if the 4 state challange is possible for me due to the knees. If I dont make it I will be taking 2 days to do the 4 states challange while Gray is my support and I will then support him when he completes the challange. You have 24 hours to do it in so it will mean a record early morning for Gray. The nights here havent been too chilly. So much better with an insulated sleeping pad. Last night Gray made a lovley fire and I just layed in the grass for hours watching the sunset and the stars come out. Its perfect when your miles away from any city lights. One thing I will miss on the trail but I sure will not miss the using the loo in the woods. This girl loves a bathroom that flushes and has running water. Makes me really appericate how good we all really have it.,"Rutland, Vt

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550653,"Total Miles 2189.5Over the past few weeks I have really neglected my journal. A lot of that has to do with the fact that we have been knocking away the miles faster and all I really can think of doing at the end of a long day is sleep. Since I last updated we were able to do 2 days with 43 miles in it. The first day we were able to cross the whole state of Connecticut. That was hard. Then there was today where we were able to make it to the conservatory right before they were shutting down for the evening. The 4 state challenge was a complete success! We were able to finish much faster then our trial because there were literally no more mountains. We loved to see all the changing fall colors as we were hiking further south. The most color we experienced was in Vermont. During our walk in New York we did experience some colors but I was not a huge fan of that state it was dirty and we had to cross a few major highways. The Delaware water gap was super beautiful. Pennsylvania was everything we expected to include rocks, rocks, and wait for it more rocks. That went away half way through though and it was soon smooth sailing. So today we were up before the rooster crows getting to our starting point on the trail. Near Pen Mar road. We hiked out of Pennsylvania and into Maryland where a majority of our miles were in today. There was one spot that had a really cool look out. It was also where a local hang glider club launched there members off of. I think the most neatest thing was the war correspondence memorial they had for all the writer in the war. There was only 8 miles to walk in West Virginia. A majority of it we were walking along the Patomic river. When we hit Virginia it was almost too serial. We turned around and made our way to snap a shot at the AT conservatory. It was not really the finishing welcome we were expecting. Upon arrival we stated that we were finished. The ladies at the desk at first were confused then proceeded to ask of if we were sure. Its like seriously are we sure ummm.... heck yes. Well we got our 2000 mile photo taken and had a cheers with some apple cider. The next weird thing was the supervisor started to grill us on our hiking asking a bunch of questions as if she really didn't believe us. I'm sure if I took off my shoes the living proof lies there. My snarled caused feet tell a harsh story. No wonder most people don't choose West Virginia as there end point. It sure is no Katahdan.","Stream near Harmon Hill

Prim,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550656,"It has now been roughly a week since our finish of the trail. I can say that I am super excited to have completed this journey with Gray. In the end we could not have done this trip without the love and support from our family and friends. It will be a interesting adjustment from our biggest worry of the day being where to sleep or find water. We started our journey on April 8th on the chilly Springier Mountain, Ga. The forest had not yet been awoken by the breath of spring. Our views were of trees with no leaves and brown everything. Soon came changes as we progressed further north. Not only did the weather change but so did the earth. The trail transformed seemly overnight. We saw more flowers, birds, animals, and people. The oddest day was in the Smokie mountains waking up to snow in May. The changing of the seasons were not the only changes we were able to experience. In a way as we started Gray and I were both worn and weathered like winter in the woods. The longer we spent on the trail the more we were able to transform ourselves into happier better people. I found that as I became stronger I had more confidence in myself. Not only that; I was able peel away the onion of my mind and mentally fix things emotionally that I had been struggling with. One thing others would never get to experience is watching the transformation happen to your spouse. I am very lucky to have completed this journey with Gray. Would not have traded that for the world. Nature has a beautiful way of easing the mind and allowing you to fully reset. Until our next journey I believe Henry David Thearu said it best, ""I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees.""","Harpers Ferry, Wv
