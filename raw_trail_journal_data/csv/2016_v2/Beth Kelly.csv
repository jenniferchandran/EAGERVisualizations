Beth Kelly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521484,"I was hoping for a miserable winter day to give my gear system one last tough test. Unfortunately, it's 70 and sunny in Columbia! There were a lot of pale legs out on the trails today- mine included.Everything worked smoothly. I purified water, set camp up (6 minutes), boiled water, and took camp down (5 minutes). Total hiking was just shy of 8 miles.It's hard to believe I get to do this all for real in a week. Jon and I have a hotel near Amicolola Falls for next weekend. Almost every room near the park is booked...what could everyone be doing out there?! Haha. My current plan is to hike the approach trail on Sunday and for Jon to drop me off just past Springer Mountain on Monday morning.",,A Final Shakedown,"Feb 20, Sat",0
