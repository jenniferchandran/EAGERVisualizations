Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521138,"Walked the Yellow Trail today and the temperature was great for walking. Not too many folks on the trails today since this is a Tuesday and pretty chilly this AM. I decided to hike the Yellow Trail today. It doesn't have the highest hills but it does have a number of ""ups and downs"" which I like. There were anumber of white tail deer out today and plenty of squirrels scooting around. I only ran across 3 hikers on the trail. One of the hikers I met has hiked sections of the AT and would like to take a thru hike but hasn't had the opportunity. Did about 13 miles today with a 29 lb. pack and feel that I am adjusting to it pretty well. Some tightness around the shoulders toward the end of a hike but overall not too much discomfort. Looking forward to our hike and camp out in Pine Mountain next week with Mustardseed. Next time...",,Oak Mountain,"Feb 09, Tue",0

The parking lots were already filling up and a number of parents had their children with them. During the walk I noticed that a young couple had already set their tent for the weekend. It should be beautiful this weekend and I am sure Oak Mountain will have a lot of folks. Walked the Yellow trail today with a 30 lb backpack for about 13 miles. There were a number of folks near both trail heads but very few in the middle. A lot of kids out to enjoy nature, which is good. Next time...",,"Oak Mountain Alabama, Yellow Trail","Feb 13, Sat",13

We hiked 46 miles over three days and had 2 nights camping to test our equipment. We had rain the first night and our equipment held up well. We had a 26 degree F night the second night and our sleeping bags kept us warm. We were able to make a fire both nights by gathering wood on the mountain sides that had a chance to dry out. The campsites were great, plenty of water and nice places to put our tents. We are really looking forward to the AT.",,Pine Mountain Georgia,"Feb 16, Tue",0

Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526159,We spent last night at Hawk Mountain shelter after 15.3 miles of hiking from Amicalola Falls.

She is such a great person and Mustardseed is lucky to have a friend like her.   The North Georgia Hiking Club was on the trail yesterday handing out Trail Magic. It was all yummy. We had a good bit of rain overnight and was able to get every thing cleaned up and on the trail around 8 AM.

We saw some beautiful sites and met many wonderful hikers with Maine in their minds. We were met at Woody Gap by Tom, who picked us up and drove us to his cabin.   Tom is a great guy that has a student at Mustardseed's school where she teaches. He cooked a great dinner.

Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526556,"MustardSeed and I walked 18.8 miles to BlueMountain shelter from Neel Gap today. We got to the mountain pretty late and were dead tired. Emphasis on the dead. At Neel gap we me Taradactle good been communicating with us about traveling to Maine. He is from New Hampshire and is a very nice guy to be on the trail with. The only problem that Taradactle was that he had a stove that appeared to be patented in the early 1600s. he actually made him himself from doing a video online. I was afraid he was going to blowup with it so we had an extra pocket rocket stove that we were able to give him. I think he likes it. He found a gas can in one of the drop boxes that people leave in various places. All in all, real good people on the trail headed to Maine, hope we all make it.","Neel Gap

There were a number of hikers at the shelter just trying to stay warm. The wind blew all night long and the temperature got down into the low 20s.

Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527225,Mustardseed and I arrived in Franklin to a group from Athens Georgia sharing trail magic for those coming off the trail. We enjoyed the conversations very much and the people there were very friendly. We certainly appreciated the hospitality.MustardSeed's friend Lisa met us at the gap to carry us into Franklin. She also bought us a great lunch at a Mexican restaurant here in Franklin. You don't know how much we appreciated her doing this. She also took us by Walmart so we could pick up some trail items that we need over the next few days. Lisa went above and beyond what anyone else would have...TRAIL MAGIC!,"Winding Stair Gap

We had breakfast at the Shell station...the only restaurant is closed on Tuesday and Wednesday. We hiked 10.4 miles out Damascus. Met Kristen and Crotchfire at Abingdon Shelter. The water at shelter was a good 1/4 down hill and the spring was small but had water. We had to use a dipping cup to gather the water since the spring was only about 3"" deep.","Damascus to Erwin

Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551228,"Watauga lake. Crotchfire left this morning intending to walk 25 miles today. He is a young man from West Virginia and probably can make the 25 miles but he's got some high mountains to go up. Met Swan along the trail. He is on his way to Maine. I told him the park was closed already in Maine and he said that he would probably not get there till next May and it would be open again. Steve and I stopped at the Vandeventer shelter to have a snack. We're looking at going to the hostel at Watauga lake and then camp out somewhere around the lake. The shelter was closed because of bear problems. We stayed at the Boots Off Hostel and it was great. Met Jeremiah hiking from Maine. He left in June. Vintage and Lady Bird were at the Hostel, they are from Charlotte. Met Mad Mike from Scituate. Boots Off Hostel, Jim is the owner from Wisconsin, Glenn is the Chef and he is from New Hampshire.

Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551238,"Boots Off Zero DaySteve (now with the trail name ""Manley"") fell yesterday and injured his knee. As a result we are taking a zero day today. Mad Mike offered to let him use his knee brace but Manley wants to get one that fits better from a local pharmacy. If Manley can't make it tomorrow I am hiking alone. He will get a ride back to Erwin and my daughter Michelle agreed to pick me up in Erwin at Uncle Johnny's. Boots Off is a great place to stay and zero. They provide a great breakfast and dinner. We had barbecue chicken, smashed potatoes, and squash for dinner (ham was available but I don't eat pork). Breakfast was good this morning.,,omelette, apple, potatoes, and toast. We ordered a pizza for lunch/dinner from Bootleggers Barbecue (strange name for a place that sells pizza). We plan to have breakfast here and begin hiking tomorrow. Steve bought a knee brace to hopefully help him for the remainder of the hike. Enjoy this beautiful planet.??","Boots Off Hostel

Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551324,"Two Days from Boots Off HostelWe left Boots Off on Sunday heading for mile 413.8.and finished with 13 miles. Boost Pilgrim came by the campsite and got water and said he was heading for the next shelter. We saw a beautiful waterfall along the way and the picture attached doesn't do it justice. Coming up from the waterfall there were about 300 steps almost straight up. Cannot send this due to no phone service...neither Verizon or ATT and will send when I get power.I am including our trek on 11/7 since we still have no service. Seriously, we are in the back country...ain't much here...no bears either, haven't seen one yet. Pretty easy hike today but tomorrow will be a tough one. We are staying at the Mountaineer Shelter and hiked 11.9 miles. This shelter is a double decker and is one of the best I have seen since leaving Damascus. Boogey Pilgrim came by the shelter but decided to continue to the next camping site. Met Steve who is north bound to Damascus and this will finish the trail for him.

We called a hostel at the base of Doll Mtn. About staying there and having their big breakfast but they were not having it so we decided to continue on. The climb was from 2895 to 4600. I am glad we decided to continue. Met a bunch of Day Hikers that were taken to the top of the mountain by the Hostel and they were hiking down. The campsite is nice and we had a good dinner.

Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551369,"Left Following Flats after a rainy night and headed out for Roan Mountain Shelter. We were up in the clouds most of the day and the wind was terrific. We climbed most of the day trying to reach our 6500 feet destination, Roan Mountain Shelter. Met only one hiker that was on the trail. Rabbit. He is a chef in Ocean Side Maryland and is off during the off season tourist time. He is section hiking trying toakr the entire trail. We finality made it to Roanountain Shelter and Boogy Pilgrim was there. We immediately ate dinner and went to bed. It was cold, 24 degrees and the wind was about 35 miles per hour. We got up and ice was on all the trees. I went out to use the bathroom with my toilet tissue and Huggies Wipes and had to use only the tissue. The Wipes were frozen solid...perhaps Kimberly-Clark should put some antifreeze in those things. I had my first fall today. Got my foot hung under s root and fell forward. I hit my hand first and strained it. My chin hit the ground and my head hit at rock. My chin had a beard to protect and my head was no cpetition for ""only"" a rock. My wife had always told me I am hard headed. We saw a couple of hunters with long rides and bows today on the trail. Arrived at the hostel and look forward to some warm food.
