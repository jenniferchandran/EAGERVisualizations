GRay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535870,"My backpacking Journey on the AT trail is now only one week away! This is my first attempt to post with Trailjournals in hopes that anyone interested in my travels can keep up with me.I have thought for a while that I should give this challenge a try. Being retired but active, I needed a new challenge to test me physically and mentally. I wanted something that would require new skills and embellish some skills I already have. Walking for 1,000 miles while backpacking for 90 days seemed to fit the bill. When my good friend Rick Hunt (who has vast backpacking experience all over the world) told me in March of this year that he was going to walk some of the AT trail starting in June, I goaded him into letting me tag along. We had hiked together in Baja, California and in Peru, so we knew we were a good fit.Preparing for the trip has certainly been a learning experience. I have a lot of hiking experience but no backpacking experience. I had to buy everything from backpack and sleeping bag to food to cooking utensils. One of the first things I bought was a postal meter so I could weigh everything I am taking down to the tenth of an ounce. While I am not a ""gram weenie"" trying to have the highest pack on the trail, I have experienced just how much difference every pound makes when you carry it for 15 miles a day. I started off trying to get under 40 pounds, then tried to limit myself to 33 pounds, and now I am down to 30 pounds. This is with one liter of water and about 4 days of food supply. In the next two days I will see if I can find another pound to cut out. There are still a few tricks I have not used such as repackaging food and cutting any extra strap length from my backpackThere are a few items that have added more to my weight than my friend Rick will be carrying. The first is my backpack.I ended up with an REI Traverse 70 which is rated to carry from 25 up to more than 50 pounds. I tried to get a lighter smaller backpack but none of them fit me right or balanced properly. The pack weighs 77 ounces with the included rain cover, a good 24 ounces more than I would have liked. The second is a camp chair (Alite Monarch) an ultralight compact chair but still 19 ounces that most people do not carry. I need the chair to rest my back properly when we are not hiking. My herniated disk from many years back is the weak link in my body that I must always work to overcome.Our hike starts next Monday, June 6th, with a flight to Atlanta and a shuttle to a hiker hostel close to the start of the trail. From the drop off point we have to actually walk south to climb Springer Mountain, the official start of the trail. Then we head north for 1023 miles to Harper's Ferry, WV. Most hikers who are trying to walk all of the AT at one time had to start in March or April to finish in Maine before winter sets in. They also had to endure a lot of snow and cold that we should not have in June. There will be less crowds starting this late in the season and there might be more room in the shelters should we have to use them. We shall see how quick it takes all of our planning to go ""out the window"" once we get started.",,View Entry,"May 31, Tue",0
GRay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536255,"We are having historic flooding in central Texas where I live. This has given me good opportunities to walk in rain and mud, two things I am sure to encounter often on the AT. I am down to the last bit of tweaking before closing up my backpack. Do I take that extra 1.3 ounces of oatmeal? What if I want to eat oatmeal and have hot tea at the same time (oh shoot, I will have to make a pot cozy to hold the oatmeal). Off to Home Depot to buy some Relectix and some reflecting tape! Trying to decide whether or not to take an extra pair of hiking shorts is excruciating, but I believe my convertible REI hiking pants and my lightweight Salamon trail shorts will be enough and I don't need the extra 8 ounces. I have tried to keep my weight under 30 pounds with water and food, but last minute creep has brought me to 30.2 pounds. My last decision is whether or not to add 14 ounces for my iPad. It is hard to imagine any kind of quality life without the iPad!I am also calorie loading this week. I plan to eat about 2200 calories per day, not near enough to replace the 4000-5000 calories I will burn. I have extra peanut butter, protein powder, olive oil, etc... to bring my daily calories to 3,519 if I need to, but I need to be prepared to go an extra day without resupplies in case we hit bad weather, have an injury, or any one of a number of things that can happen once we start hiking.Only a few more of these boring pre-hike entries before we start hiking and I hopefully have more interesting things to say.","

GRay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536483,Still learning to use this site with my limited technical skills. What I am trying to do is add a picture of the food I will be starting out with for my hike.,,View Entry,"Jun 03, Fri",0
GRay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537006,"Traveled most of the day to get to the Hikel Hostel, about an hour away from Springer Mountain. Got everything organized and ate pizza. Hostel is very comfortable, but we we e surprised to see 21 people staying the night. Our group to be taken to Springer Mountain tomorrow will number 10. There are a lot of people that are doing section hikes, some only for a few days. We are told that 30% of the section hikers quit before finishing 30 miles.We do not leave the hostel until 9 am tomorrow. That means we don't start hiking until 10 am and probably will only make it to the Hawk Mountain shelter. The people at the hostel tell us that 8-10 miles is a realistic average per day, depending on weather and terrain. I guess we will figure it out over the next few days.","

GRay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537378,"We started out at Springer Mountain Tuesday morning after a great breakfast at the Hiker Hostel. We got dropped off at 10:15 am at the parking lot and had to walk backwards 1 mile to get to the top of Springer Mountain where the trail officially begins. We wanted to reach the Gooch Shelter which meant over 17 miles of hiking and did not really seem possible with the late start. However the weather was good and we felt good so we decided to go for it. We did not reach the shelter until 7:30 pm and there must have been over 30 people already there. We hurriedly set up our tents on pretty slanted ground and cooked our dinners. After hanging our bear bags, it was off to sleep. The next morning we got a 7:30 am start, hoping to cover 16.8 miles to Neels Gap where we could get a hostel for the night. We will always do extra miles if it means we can get a bed and a roof. Hiking was a little tougher today with more ups and downs, but we made the hostel at 4:15 pm. I immediately had a Klondike bar, a Gatorade, and then ordered and ate a whole frozen pizza. I guess I was hungrier than I thought. My only drama today is when I veered from the trail for a bit when I was on a rocky area at the top of Blood Mountain. I only strayed a few hundred yards before I became suspect and turned around. I soon ran into some locals who pointed me the right way and gave me my first trail magic, two lifesavers. Their names were Trail Doc and Trail Shark and they said my trail name should be Detour. Not sure I like the name.Now off to the next campsite, about 13 miles away.","Springer Mountain

GRay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537810,"We made it to Poplar Stamp Gap at 4:30 pm after starting a little late at 9:00am. We have been amazed every day at how up and down this trail continues to be. There is not one level step, and the average grade appears to be about 17%. Today there was an Eastern diamondback rattlesnake on the trail that caused us to detour into the woods after I almost stepped on it. I have never consumed as much water as I have the last few days. Probably 6-7 liters per day. This is because we sweat for 9 hours each day. I am also pounding electrolytes, but I surprised that I seem to do ok without too many calories of food.Poplar Stamp Gap campground is nothing but a flat place to put your tent. We found a small trickle of water 1/3 of a mile away that at least provided hydration. A deer grazed very close to our tents before dark, and when we heard crashing in the woods at 3 in the morning we convinced ourselves that it as that same deer and not a bear.Tomorrow we make it to Tray Mountain shelter after another tough walk.","Poplar Stamp Gap

GRay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537811,"Yesterday we completed the toughest day so far. Several large climbs of 900 feet or more. We got to the shelter before almost anyone and got good tent sites. We avoid shelters before other people are too close and there is no protection from bugs and critters. This will change if it starts raining.There were bears in the campsite during the night. One couple had there bear canister stolen from a bear and a bear also rummaged around a campfire by the shelter after someone threw trash in the embers. The requirement to hang all food by bear bags is serious, and it only takes one offender to cause problems.The weather was awesome at the higher elevation and I slept better than any night so far. Tomorrow we get a bed and a steak. Good motivation for our 11 mile hike in.","Tray Mountain shelter

GRay,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537958,"I made a big decision while sitting on the veranda of the hostel after another long day of hiking. I asked myself why I wanted to continue to walk several hours a day just to get to the next shelter. Yes I love the exercise but I can do that anywhere. I am in shape physically and emotionally to go as far as I want. But why suffer bugs, bears, the continuous search for water, freeze dried food, rain, etc...So I called my old friend Ron who lives nearby and asked him if he wanted a visitor. He agreed to come pick me up so we could spend a few days exploring the area around Maggie Valley. From there, I am headed back to Texas.This morning I was processing this sudden decision to leave. Was it a failure? Did I not have what it takes? Was I missing the point somewhere?I walked out to the veranda of the hostel to check my backpack and met a guy who designed backpacks for REI. He asked me if I liked my Traverse 70 backpack. I told him what I liked and did not like and that I was leaving the trail because it seemed somewhat boring to me and not worth the effort. His reply was very insightful to me.He told me that the AT was different from most hikes in that the hike was not about making it to the next huge vista or being wowed by majesty. No. It was more about working out all of the things going on in your head and stopping to enjoy the small pleasures that quietly present themselves along the journey. Validation! This was exactly what I had been thinking and it helped me realize that the AT trail is a very personal journey that will not be enjoyable unless you have very personal reasons for continuing. I am not yet at that point so there is no reason for me to continue. I now know that I can go into the woods with a backpack and be comfortable for several days, and maybe I will return to the AT when in the proper mood. I thank my friend Rick who has taught me so much and I wish him a successful journey from this point forward.","Top of Georgia hostel.
