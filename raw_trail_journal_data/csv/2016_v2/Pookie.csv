Pookie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518001,"Well, I have procrastinated for long enough with starting this. Finally I find the time to write. I have been so busy trying to make money to subsidize this adventure as well as my sudden impulse to see billy joel in NYC. I am not very goodly at grammmmer and splng so fortunately one of my closest friends from college has agreed to edit my journals, except the first few. I owe her a lot, such an awesome lady. I went on a month long trip in the adirondacks and a month in new zealand, she gave me this ""lucky hiking stone"" to carry. I have carried it on every tip since, seems a bit odd to carry a rock but its been a reminder that she is there for me. I can't say now why I am hiking mostly because I haven't developed a solid reason yet, so that will come later. I have decided to start the weekend of march 13th. I figure this date will give me plenty of time to enjoy the trail, I dont want to rush, I don't have to. Looking forward to meeting everyone on the trail!",,No where yet,"Dec 04, Fri",0
Pookie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518176,"Entry 2, This thing says I need three journal entries before it will publish so this and the next entry are kind of BS. Thinking alot about hiking, it occupies most of my day, I've read ""AWOL on the Appalachian Trail"" and ""A Walk in the Woods"" each twice, working on ""walking with spring"". I mostly think about actually hiking but then I think about how much I am looking forward to it, that worries me. I think about it to get thru the days, something to drive me and look forward to, I rarely enjoy the present. Will I do that when I start hiking? Will I loose track of the moment because Im too busy looking to what's next? I hope not.",,NONE,"Dec 05, Sat",0
Pookie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518177,"My friend Ricky was originally going to be my hiking partner. I was thrilled he agreed to come. We had done a month long trek in the adirondacks with WEA and had a blast. We shared a major in college as well as many classes and projects. I asked him and he was all for it, he had hiked 1/3 of the trail the year before but his partners decided to call it and he had no choice because they shared systems. We were in contact for a few months when he just stopped talking to me, he won't message back or take my calls. Its kind of strange, friends for years then nothing. I think he just decide not to hike. I hope he is still hiking and just not going with me, it would be cool if he just said so. Wow I sound like a chick! so its solo for me I guess!",,none,"Dec 06, Sun",0
Pookie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523448,"We all know that shower time is thinking time, how to solve the world’s problems as well as your own. As I sit in my hotel room tub filled by the impressively strong flow from the shower head I can’t help but to think what if… what if I can’t make it? I know I will be broken, embarrassed, and a quitter. I once attempted the winter 46ers in college with a friend, we went up to school two weeks early hit the trail for two days and almost died. Well, my friend almost died, from hypothermia, not me ‘cause I’m, well I’m fat. We called it off after that, under the mutual agreement that our pockets were not deep enough and the first attempt sucked. Also we crashed my friend’s car into my parked truck. It was an omen. So we quit. I felt bad about quitting after three Peaks, but rum at a nearby classmate’s house soothed our souls. Now quitting is not an option, I tell myself that the only way home is to walk and NY is 2/3 of the way so why the hell not? In reality I could take a bus, but then what? I go back to working as a glorified handyman/bus driver? Yeah right! So I will walk.","none

Pookie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523974,"First section of hiking is done and I stayed on schedule for most part. My schedule says what shelters I’ll be staying at but that is just because that’s the information I had when writing it, knowing that tent sites are normally nearby. Every day is littered with picturesque views almost constantly. I know that when the leaves come I won’t be able to see as much so I have to take it in now.
The weather has been excellent, hardly a cloud in the sky except Monday and even then the average temperature has been in the 60’s. I even got sunburned over the last two days, now wishing I was smart enough to have carried sunscreen. I have been traveling an average of ten miles a day until today. 
Most days I listen to audio books but yesterday I broke my headphones and had to listen to the chatter of the forest all night. Not to say that is a problem because it’s not normally, but this particular campsite was a bit eerie. To start, it was named Slaughter Creek Campsites and it was on the side of Blood Mountain and I was the only person there. This concerned me given that the last two sites have been overfilled. I found out at neel gap that the reason nobody was there was because campers are required to have bear canisters in that area. I would have known this if I consulted my AWOL guide book instead of just relying on my guide app. No harm done, my food was not disturbed and I made a mental note to be more vigilant when it comes to planning ahead. 
Today was particularly nice because I took a half day to let my body rest, resupply, get a shower, and do laundry. My next section will last one day longer and begin to present tougher obstacles and steeper climbs as I slowly make my way towards the Smokies. In a few weeks, after the Smokies and after spring has settled in I will be able to drop considerable pack weight by sending my long underwear, sleeping pad, and other cold weather clothes home as well as trading my current tent Hammock bottom for a lighter version. I’m lugging just under 50lbs currently and can’t wait to get rid of some pounds. Summer is coming!","
