Florida Mike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547406,"If you ever have achilles tendon surgery, you can relate better to my past year. The injury occurred on my last AT section hike in Virginia in early May 2015. That Trail Journal describes in more detail what occurred.My surgery was on 8/11/2015 at the Andrews Orthopedic Institute in Gulf Breeze, FL. Dr. Daniel Murawski did the surgery to remove a heel spur and the achilles tendon debridement and repair. He is a foot and ankle specialist at Andrews. Physical therapy was at First Choice Physical Therapy on PC Beach. They are the best orthopedic medical care in this area.In planning a return to the trail, I decided to be patient and wait til end of this summer after our vacation house cleaning business slowed down.I visited my orthopedic surgeon on Aug 1st to discuss my hiking plans. His advice was to go for it, just cut back on the daily miles. After thinking about returning to Luray, VA or trying the Long Trail in Vermont again, I finally decided on Vermont. My approach to this hike is one of caution. I do not know what to expect in the mountains with how the operative foot will respond to up and down hiking in the mountains with a backpack.I emailed Rockfish to ask what his plans were. He suggested starting the hike in northern Massachussets as a warm up, and taking in Mt. Greylock, just south of the MA/VT state line. So that's my plan. It's early August, and I need to finish up gear and clothing selection and travel plans. Our cleaning schedule begins to slack off a bit in middle of August. more to come","

Florida Mike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547407,"So the hike is on.Decided again to fly into Albany, NY on Delta, get Dave Ackerson to shuttle me to Cheshire, MA to get on the AT and start the hike.At this time, my plan is simply one day at a time.   I've told friends I plan another Long Trail thru hike to Canada.   But I can't project past a day or so, if my operative foot begins to bother me at any time, I have to stop hiking. I don't expect any problems based on the doctor's advice, and my training here.speaking of training, it's been minimal, nothing like past hikes. Cleaning beach vacation houses is a lot of walking and climbing stairs for 8-10 hours a day, but not with a backpack or on rocky terrain.So I'm doing the elliptical and stair climber machine at the gym, and started doing the beach condo 23-floor staircase again with a 25 lb backpack. It's hard the first time a year after surgery. But no hiking here, it's too hot and humid in the summer, and the ticks and bugs are horrible here. my plan is use the first few days on the AT as my warm up and not do more then 12-13 miles per day.so bought my Delta ticket to fly up on August 18th to Albany, NY. and getting gear together. It's been a hot summer in New England","

Florida Mike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547408,"Last day at home.My flight tomorrow is at 5:45 a.m. CDT with a connection in Atlanta, and arrival in Albany, NY at 11:10 a.m. EDT. Have my shuttle ride arranged. Dave is out of town this week, so his sister-in-law is doing the shuttle. FWIW if you need any shuttle rides in southern Vermont or northern MA, I highly recommend Dave Ackerson, he is in the AT Guide book.   Very reliable, professional, and a great guy. He works at Williams College in Williamstown, MA and lives in North Adams, MA, very close to the AT and LT.Have gear ready to go. Biggest change from the past is footwear selection.I'm using the Brooks Cascadia 10's for this hike.   The Cascadia has become a favorite of PCT hikers, and I've been wearing Brooks shoes this summer and love them. My orthopedic surgeon and I had a long talk on footwear and insoles. He told me I do not need Superfeet insoles or any orthotics. So, I'm wearing the shoes with the standard insoles with the shoes.all is ready to go here for an early morning wakeup. Natasha driving me to the airport at 4 a.m. I plan to have the shuttle driver take me directly from Albany airport to the AT road crossing in Cheshire, MA and try to make it to top of Mt. Greylock the first day.   About 8 miles and a 2500 ft. elevation climb.
Final note. I'm still carrying my small Canon digital camera. When I return home, I now use an ASUS Chromebook, so I hope to be able to upload photos to Trail Journal faster. I may upload more photos from this hike than past hikes. we'll see how it goes.",,Home,"Aug 17, Wed",0
Florida Mike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547409,"My flights are on time and go without a hitch. I'm carrying my backpack on the plane with me, had already shipped my hiking poles and a couple other items ahead to Dave Ackerson.So the shuttle driver drops me off at the Dunkin Donuts/gas station about 0.2 miles off the AT road crossing on MA-8 in Cheshire, MA.I grab some lunch there and repack my gear in the backpack, takes about 30-40 minutes out in the parking lot. I pack stuff differently in the backpack while flying, so have to repack and rearrange stuff and pack the stuff I had shipped ahead to Dave (Hiking poles, titanium pot, lighter, pocketknife, Ti spork, anything I think TSA might not let me carry on the plane). My neighbor is a Delta flight attendant and coached me what I could carry on with my backpack (Osprey Atmos 50, which was just small enough to be okay as a carry-on). I wanted to avoid checking on the backpack, getting hit with the $25 Delta fee for check-on baggage, and with only a 45 minute layover in Atlanta, avoid the risk of my backpack not making the Atlanta-Albany flight. Plus waiting in Albany 20-30 minutes for baggage to be offloaded from the plane, while my shuttle driver was waiting outside. It's just a whole lot easier to just carry on the backpack if you can do it. Advantage of AMTRAK, no TSA security hassles, you can carry on ALL of your hiking stuff, including hiking poles. It is very hot up here, in the high 80s and very humid. But it's a sunny day.So my initial reaction at being back on the trail after a year and surgery...well it cannot be described here.   Lucky? Fortunate?   Disbelief? yes all of thatit's a tough climb for me, but I arrive at top of Greylock around 5:45 pm. Beautiful climb, and it's back in the Canadian zone, looks like Vermont or the Smokies on the climb up Greylock.there's a cool lodge at the top, Bascom Lodge, they have a bunkroom and it's only $35/night for hikers. My other plan was stealth camp in the Thunderbolt Ski Hut on top. I get a bunk in the bunkroom and take a shower and eat some food and meet some other folks at the lodge. Crash early I'm beat after first day back on the trail.I highly recommend Bascom Lodge.   The war memorial at top of Greylock is under renovation, it's got scaffolding all around it. There's a road up to the top so lots of day hikers and visitors up here.Tomorrow I plan to hike north across the VT/MA state line and maybe make it to Seth Warner Shelter.","Cheshire, MA
",Mt Greylock,"Aug 18, Thu",8
Florida Mike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547410,"I wake up early in the Bunkroom, and a continental breakfast in the dining room is included. Turns out it's homemade blueberry muffins and coffee.   They have some kind of award winning chef at Bascom Lodge.   The dinners are expensive here, but folks here rave about the food.I get a cook to order omelette too, costs about $10 but worth it. So after breakfast I pack up and head north after taking a bunch of photos of the lodge and top of Greylock.The AT heading north from Greylock summit is a very steep descent. No switchbacks at the top.   I meet a lot of southbound AT thru hikers on this hike, and dayhikers too.I get to the North Adams road crossing around noon, and stop at the Greylock Community Center on MA-2 to grab a diet Coke and use the rest room. It is only about 0.1 miles off the trail. For info, the Greylock Community Center offers free long term parking for AT or LT hikers in their lot.Finally continue north on familiar terrain. This is my 5th hike of this AT/LT section, although it's been 2 years since my last hike here.The trail goes alongside on house, and the owner chats with me about an incident a couple weeks ago with some troublesome AT thru hikers, a group of about 6 that were partying in the woods behind his house, building campfires where fires are prohibited. Finally I get to Seth Warner Shelter and there's room in the shelter for the night. I meed some other section hikers, some AT SoBo thru hikers, and it looks like tent city around the shelter. The spring is just down hill from the shelter and has good water flow. The bear box is locked up because hikers were leaving their trash in it.","Mt Greylock
",Seth Warner Shelter,"Aug 19, Fri",13.10
Florida Mike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547412,"My 3rd day back on the trail.   Still very hot and humid up here. Locals tell me it's been one of the hottest summers they can recall, and until recently very dry.   I notice the mud on the trail is about how I remember from past hikes up here. They say they had some rain over the last couple weeks, but most of June and July was very dry.The hike goes well today. I get the Bennington Taxi to pick me up at the VT-9 road crossing around 1 pm, and take me into Bennington for resupply and a McDonalds lunch stop. My time in town is about 2.5 hours, with a stop at the ALDI grocery store to get 3-4 days food for the next section to Manchester Center, VT.   I meet a NoBo thru hiker the last couple miles before the VT-9 road crossing, his name is Ziplock. He started in Georgia in early April. We split the taxi fare, he is going to Catamount motel for the night and resupply.It's only my 3rd day on the trail, it's tempting to stay in town, but I need to get on, so I get the taxi ride back to the trail/road crossing, about 6 miles outside Bennington, and hike up the mountain to the first shelter for the night.When I get there, there's only 2 other hikers staying there. A couple of Univ of Alabama co-eds who just graduated. They are on the girls' rowing team at ALabama. We chat for a while, they are in the shelter, I'm going to setup my tarp tonight in the tenting area.   I'm amazed they are glued to social media the entire time I see them at the shelter. No rain overnight, good night for sleeping, and my first night using my MLD silnylon Grace tarp. It sets up easy and works well and only weighs 10 oz.Water is good at the spring at this shelter, but no privy here.","Seth Warner Shelter
",Melville Nauheim Shelter,"Aug 20, Sat",13.10
Florida Mike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547413,"When I planned this hike, my intent was not to go over 13 miles per day.That lasts 3 days. Today I'm back to the old ways of hiking to Story Spring Shelter. There's another shelter, Kid Gore Shelter, about 4.6 miles south, and I originally intended to stay there. But I get there around 3 p.m, and I feel fine, so I decided to hike another 4.6 miles to Story Spring.   The weather is beginnning to deteriorate today, high winds and cloudy and a little cooler.My lunch break at Goddard Shelter is really nice. It's one of the nicest shelters in southern Vermont.   Can tell a storm is coming. Looks like they have built a new privy here, and Goddard has one of the best pipe springs on the trail.Finally arrive at Story Spring shelter around 5:30 pm, with rain coming. It's a full shelter, I meet some good guys here, a mix of section hikers and a couple Nobo AT thru hikers and one SoBo AT thru hiker. Good thing decide to stay in the shelter cuz it rains hard and windy all night.","Melville Nauheim Shelter

Florida Mike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547414,"This part of the AT/LT begins with up and over Stratton Mountain, a popular winter ski resort in Vermont. The morning is very misty, foggy and cold on top of Stratton. Wind chill in the 40s. The caretakers cabin has a fire going in the wood stove.I meet a section hiker here from Pennsylvania, she is only out for a couple days heading north, we hike a similar pace so I end up seeing her at shelters the next couple days.By mid day the weather is clearing, and I take a nice rest break on banks of Stratton Pond, it's a beautiful sunny day now and warming back up. I meet lots of section hikers and other AT SoBo thru hikers now along the trail. And begin to meet some of the college orientation groups out on the trail. I hear from a local there are alot of college orientation groups out in southern VT now. Yale, Harvard, Dartmouth, Williams College all do this with their incoming freshmen classes.Finally end up at Spruke Peak Shelter, which is a really big old log cabin with a wood stove, and sleeping platforms for up to 10 hikers. I meet quite a group here. One group of 3 SoBo thru hikers, the 2 NoBo thru hikers I was with the night before, and the lady section hiker. It ends up being one of my nicer nights on this hike, enjoyed talking with all these guys, and they build a campfire in the fire ring.My second time staying at this shelter, back in 2012 stayed in the tent area. Back then the pipe spring was not running. This trip the pipe spring is running very well, and there is a privy here.This shelter is about 2.8 miles south of the VT-11/30 highway crossing just outside Manchester Center, VT.","Story Spring Shelter

Florida Mike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547417,"Today weather was perfect for hiking, still warm but sunny and not quite as humid.Got up early, hiked down to the VT-11/30 highway crossing, and within 5 minutes caught a hitch into town with a GMC caretaker from Stratton Pond shelter. He works for GMC from Aug 1st to Oct 15th at the shelter. Nice guy he's also taking in water samples to the USDA Forest Service office from some ponds and creeks up in the mountains.He takes me into town, where I visit ""Up for Breakfast"" in Manchester. There's a NoBo AT thru hiker here I chat with, he caught Lymes Disease in Pennsylvania and had to get off the trail for 2-3 weeks and taking antibiotics. He described the symptoms to me, not fun.   He said it was a tick so small he couldn't see it, it had burrowed into his skin right in center of stomach at bottom of his ribcage. The fever and chills and fatigue hit him before the rash showed up. He's getting back on the trail here, but I never saw him again on this hike.After resupply of food, a stop at McDonalds and a stop at a pharmacy and the Mountain Goat, I decide to get back to the trail. Get a ride back and on the AT/LT by around 2 pm. The hike up to Bromley Mtn is awesome.   This is the best visibility possible, clear and sunny skies you can see the Adirondacks and all the way to the NH White Mountains from top of Bromley, which is another ski mountain in southern VT.Finally after the tough hike up and over Styles Peak and Peru Peak, I get to the Peru Peak Shelter in the early evening. Full shelter here with a large family outing of really nice people here for the night.   Here I also meet VT-Mike, he's doing a NoBo Long Trail Hike, he's from NH.A very large group of Yale students come thru here and move on to Griffith Lake tenting area for the night.A section hiker has his guitar and over a campfire plays some Bob Dylan and other pop tunes.   Really the best night on this hike.","Spruce Peak Shelter

Florida Mike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547419,"Hiked much of this day with VT-Mike and Patty (section hiker from PA that I met at Stratton Mtn. Patty is very nice and I've enjoyed hiking with her, but she has decided to head home at the VT-140 road crossing this afternoon. I've been fortunate to meet and hike with VT-Mike and Patty, all of us hike about the same pace and enjoy talking to them.
There's trail magic at the Danby Rd crossing parking lot, where ""Paddywagon"" has setup his truck and serving cold grape soda and hot dogs. I have a half cup of grape soda but pass on the hot dogs.I meet several SoBo and NoBo AT hikers thru the day. Orginally I planned to stop at Greenwall Shelter, but later decided to hike on to Minerva Hinchey Shelter.this is a very pretty section of the AT/LT, the trail passes Little Rock Pond and numerous beaver ponds....the trail here passes White Rocks and the amazing rocks along the trail that are placed by hikers. The 'cascades' just before VT-140 are very pretty too, we all stop here to cool off and get water.Finally arrive at the shelter late in the day, the shelter is full with another Yale student orientation group, so VT-Mike and I setup our tarps in the tent area. There is a spring and privy at this shelter. I also meet another NoBo LT hiker here from Pittsburgh, his name is ""Bojangles"".long day, very tired, so crash soon after eating, to the sounds of the Yale group at the shelter","Peru Peak Shelter

Florida Mike,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547420,"Wakeup early cuz VT-Mike and I plan on stopping at the Whistle Stop cafe on VT-103 for breakfast. Turns out the Cafe, which is a landmark in Southern VT, is closing in September. The owner is turning it into a railroad museum.the Hiker Breakfast is awesome here and really hiker friendly people hereAfter breakfast we get back on the trail and hike to Governor Clement shelter for our midday break. The weather is turning bad, cloudy and windy with rain in the forecast. Seems every hike I do up here I get bad weather over Killington, and no different today.Killington is a popular ski resort in Vermont, 3rd highest peak in Vermont.we meet a lot of other SoBo At thru hikers at Gov Clement shelter as we take a break. It's a foggy, cloudy day with mist in the air and rain in the forecast.our plan is to get to the Inn at the Long Trail tonight, which makes this a 20 mile day for me.when this hike began, I never in my wildest dreams envisioned doing 20 mile days. I was thinking those days were past. But feeling pretty good, and hiking with VT-Mike and Bojangles motivates me to do it today.the climb up Killington is a trip hazard of rocks and tree roots, tough climb.VT-Mike has a problem with a swollen ankle, but he's still hiking well, he's not sure what he did to it. it's a very misty day on top of Killington, so no views today. We stop at Pico Camp for a short break and keep on hiking on the Sherbourne Pass Trail and arrive at US-4 around 6:30 pm, just at the Inn at the Long Trail.when we get there, Bojangles and I find out they are full for the night, no rooms. I see VT-Mike is here with his wife who drove over from NH. He says he will go into Rutland to get his ankle checked out tomorrow. As swollen as his ankle looked, and the way he is talking, I get a feeling he probably will decide to end his hike here. I think in retrospect if VT-Mike had not gotten injured, I would have been much more inclined to continue this LT hike further north and try to make it all the way to Northern Terminus. As it is I am dog tired and just want to get a shower and some sleep before deciding on whether to continue the hike.
Bojangles and I have a couple beers and nachos at the bar. We missed the last shuttle bus into Rutland too and now it's dark. He starts asking me about sharing a motel room in Rutland, and I just don't do that with someone I've only known on the trail for one day. SO I wish him well and leave the Inn at Long Trail to head into Rutland. He says he is going to tent across the highway from the Inn, and I might have done same, except there is an intense thunderstorm blowing up, with lightning, and all I have on this hike is my silnylon tarp. I end up hiking west about 2.5 miles toward Rutland on the shoulder of the highway (oh yeah that was fun), and catch a taxi ride at a motel on US-4 into Rutland for the night at the Days Inn, where I've stayed before, across street from a grocery store.Long story short, Rutland is really the point where you either spend 2 more weeks on the trail to Canada, in increasingly remote areas, or get off here to take the AMTRAK back to Florida.I talk to Natasha on the phone and decide to end this hike here. There's a tropical storm forming in the Gulf, and I don't want her to be alone down there if this storm turns into a hurricane and threatens Panama City Beach. Plus, she tells me we are getting several house cleaning jobs added to our schedule the next 2 weeks, from late vacation reservations. I'm really happy with this hike, around 120 miles in 8 days, and the foot/ankle issues are gone. I feel like a new hiker, sure, very tired, but the operative foot did great. So I get an AMTRAK ticket online at the motel computer and it leaves at 9:15 a.m. the next day.I will fill in more here later with pictures, but the hike was awesome, met some really nice people. A year ago I wasn't sure I would walk normally again. Now back on the AT/LT. Lucky and very forunate to be able to do this again.happy trails","Minerva Hinchey Shelter
