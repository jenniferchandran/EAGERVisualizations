Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542208,"“I will study and get ready, and perhaps my chance will come.”   --Abraham LincolnMy father used to say this when I was little, as I wondered if various difficult efforts would ever pay off, if my day would ever come. I learned he was usually right.So it is with the Appalachian trail. I’ve been studying, and slowly adding hiking gear, trying to be ready, waiting for my chance to come. When I needed a sleeping pad for month long assignment, it wasn’t an Aero bed, it was a Big Agnes. When I looked for a couple of shirts to wear outdoors, they weren’t heavy knit, they were lightweight Outdoor Research. Slowly I’ve accumulated what’s needed, watching for sales or deals on used gear from individuals online.I first touched the trail in 1977 (it was the week that Elvis died) with my father and brother, during a visit to the Great Smoky Mountains and Gatlinburg. I saw a shelter; I think I saw a couple thru hikers. I wanted to do that, too. I’m sure my father said, “perhaps your chance will come.” But I was in the middle of an advanced degree, and a year later I started my first job, and three years later came a promotion and marriage, and six years later I went back to college for a change of career, and 12 years later the first of four children arrived. Decades went by, I loved my life and my work, loved raising children, and rarely thought about the trail.I blinked my eyes, the kids grew up, and nearly 39 (!) years have passed since I first saw the AT. My dad passed away, but my mother is living, still fairly independent. One daughter finished college and moved to Boise, then North Carolina. Another daughter goes to school in Bozeman, MT.   Both want to hike with me if we can be flexible with the dates to time with their days off. Both sons are in New York. During many trips to New York to visit, I always knew that somewhere close, crossing under some road I was driving on, was the Appalachian Trail. In fall 2015 I found the trail again.   I was turning 60, and felt the clock ticking. Other birthdays didn’t do that to me, but this one did. Things happen more often after 60--a breast lump that’s not OK, a sciatic nerve that is unbearably pinched, a curious change in the bloodwork. Odds are against a stop-everything health problem, but they’re higher than zero and higher than the decade before. By this time I’d stumbled upon Trail Journals, downloaded the Guthook app, read a few books, and figured out that when I visited my sons in New York I was only 15 minutes from where the trail crosses the Hudson River.I started working on a plan.","

Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542335,"Last October, while in New York, my husband and youngest son went with me to the trailside zoo at Bear Mountain State Park, where I saw my first white blaze. We followed the trail across Bear Mountain Bridge. My husband and his bone-on-bone arthritic knees turned back after crossing, but my son and I followed the trail a short distance up the mountain, then veered off to the St. Anthony’s Nose overlook before heading back down. We were touched by a memorial to a fallen soldier placed at the site.My first idea was this: at some point I would ask my employer if I could be gone for 5-6 months to do the trail. But it’s not a workable plan. I can’t be gone that long and expect to have the same job I love at the place I love when I get back. We still have too many bills to pay. And my mother is almost 90. She measures her life in months, not years. My heart wouldn’t be in a 5-month absence.My second plan was to try to do the trail in one-month pieces.   But even that is difficult for my employer, and it doesn’t work well for my children who might want to join me. It would become me telling them when to be available, and they don’t have that flexibility in their lives just yet.My third plan, and I think it will work, is to hike an average of 200-220 miles per year, dividing it over several 3-7-day periods between March and November, depending on the section, my children’s schedules, and where they’re living at the time. So, the trail name is Decade. 200-220 miles per year times 10 years gives you the Appalachian Trail. Age 60 to age 70 are nice round numbers, a decade. And a quick search of Trail Journals didn’t find anyone else who’d used it. Looking ahead, and thinking about what life is likely to bring over a decade, there may be years where hiking is limited, where my vacation days go toward weddings, or the arrival of grandchildren, or supporting the needs of young parents. But there will be other years when I can hike an extra hundred miles, maybe more. Planning to do it over a decade means I think I can get it done.","

Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542474,"Posted today is the 12.8 miles over two days my daughter and I covered in May in the Bear Mountain area of New York. We only had an afternoon, evening, and next morning to hike. Not many miles, but a huge event mentally, because it meant this decade-long hike has started.Mileage in the upper right corner shows how many miles I’ve gone, not the location on the trail. Colleen and I started at the Bear Mountain Recreation Area (mile 1402.2), spent the night at the Graymoor monastery ball field, and finished at S. Highland Rd (mile 1415.0) in New York. That’s all the time we had. I suppose it was a semi-shakedown, even we hiked only a short distance and we stayed at a place that had all the essentials (PortAPotty, pump water, shelter if needed). Still, some lessons learned: Hiking poles are critical for me, at least on Bear Mountain. They saved both my neck and my knees, many times.   Daughter did fine without them, though. Pack was lightweight but could have been lighter. I had a lightweight puffy jacket that I love to wear when cold, but I didn’t need to bring it if it wasn’t going to be below 60 degrees at night.   Need a portable phone charger if checking a GPS app. I should have brought a headlamp. I like Mountain House breakfasts. For now I’m OK with carrying a stove and fuel.   I do need to carry ibuprofen. We loved our tent (Tarptent Double Rainbow) for two people and I can set it up in the dark. The Guthook app is great.My next miles are coming soon! I don’t think I ever responded to a stranger on a website before, but after “Mrs. Knobby’s” husband decided not to go any further in 2015, and she put out a call for people to hike with her in 2016, even if a few days, I contacted her. She felt like a friend I just hadn’t met yet, not a stranger. I loved the spirit and determination that showed in every word she wrote. She started the trail this year, didn’t put pressure on herself, did amazingly well for about a month, hiked about 150 miles, then headed home for a checkup due to medical concerns. If she’d been able to continue, I had hoped to join her this summer when she was in New York, and time the hike with a visit to our sons. I was so happy a few weeks ago to hear from her again. She said she would be back on the trail in late July, tackling a section in the Damascus area, and she invited me to join her group. I explained it to my family, certain they would think I’d lost it—joining hikers I knew only through the internet! If it had been my kids telling me that they were doing this, I would have been sick with worry. How encouraging it felt to hear my youngest son say, “I think it’s a great idea, Mom.”","Trailside Zoo, Ft. Montgomery, NY

Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542973,"Stayed at Hikers Inn last night, met up with Judy, Pam, and their friends Robin and Deb this morning. Shuttled to mile 490.5. Beautiful weather for hiking. Weather app says 90 degrees today but it's cooler on the trail, and never felt too hot. Boy Scouts are in the shelter, which appears very nice. Has an upstairs loft and a nearby composting privy. Tenting nearby. A great day with a great group of people.","Mile 490.5

Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543551,"Finally home and phone no longer says “No Service”!   Updating my hiking miles, which are meaningful to me but very modest by Trail Journal standards.On Thursday 7/21, hiked from Thomas Knob Shelter to Wise Shelter, 5.2 miles.   Lessons learned: 1) You can get cold at night on 90-degree days. If I have a down quilt, I’ll stay warmer if I shake the down to the center of the quilt to cover me, rather than let it drift to the far sides and leave only the inner and outer pieces of fabric over my body.   2) Tortillas and peanut butter make a quick lunch, but not worth the weight. And, I’m carrying 4 days’ worth!   3) No one told me there would be rocks like these in Virginia.   4) Made it through Fatman Squeeze. 5) I like the Mountain House Breakfast Scramble. 6) Can’t recall for sure, but this might have been the day I face-planted, tripping over a root or limb. No harm done. Thank God for hiking poles, saving me from a thousand other falls.On Friday 7/22, hiked from Wise Shelter to Old Orchard Shelter, 6.7 miles. Lessons learned: 1) I loved seeing the ponies. Even saw a foal nursing right by the side of the trail. Momma horse watched me out of the corner of her eye, but never seemed nervous. 2) I am grateful to the Eagle Scouts for what they’ve done to improve the trail. The privy at Wise Shelter, for example. The young scout chose a privy—a privy!—for his project. You guys are the best. 3) I still like the Mountain House meals. 4) Still mad I’m carrying those tortillas and peanut butter.On Saturday 7/23, hiked with my friends from Old Orchard Shelter to the Fox Creek parking lot, 1.4 miles, then hiked back to Wise Shelter, 8.1 miles, for a total of 9.5 miles. Said goodbye to Judy, Pam, Deb, and Robyn (and her dog Vini) at the Fox Creek lot. They were the best hiking partners ever. Each different, each with unique knowledge, each contributing to the group’s success in their own way. Met my daughter Monica and her friend at the parking lot for another day-and-a-half of hiking. Instead of going further north, though, turned around and headed back toward Wise Shelter, in hopes of finding some ponies. Lessons learned: 1) I’ll miss my hiking partners. 2) I need a shower after 4 days of hiking. 3) Virginia is truly beautiful.On Sunday 7/24, hiked 2.2 miles from Wise Shelter to the Massey Gap parking lot, to be shuttled back to Damascus.    Lessons learned: 1) Maybe there are other things for breakfast besides the Mountain House Breakfast Scramble.   2) Need to re-think my sleeping quilt. I woke up chilled in 60-some degree temps in a quilt that was supposed to be warm down to 35 degrees. 3) I wish I didn’t have to go home. 4) Maybe we can do this again, soon. 5) The Diet Coke and BLT at Mojo’s really hit the spot.For the purpose of the Trail Journals tally, total northbound non-retraced miles on the AT 7/21 to 7/23, Thomas Knob Shelter to Fox Creek parking lot: 13.3. Hope to be back on the trail in August, if even for only an afternoon, when visiting our sons in New York.","Thomas Knob Shelter

Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550680,"Getting ready to do a few more miles on the AT in Georgia this week. I am pretty small potatoes compared to the thru-hikers on Trail Journals, and my hikes have been too few and far between. But I am grateful for this site and the records and memories it allows all of us to share and keep. Did a few miles in New York last May, then Virginia in July, and soon Georgia for a few days of hiking. Maybe will have a chance for more miles when in Virginia and New York briefly in November. Trying to put together the entire trail over a decade. If I wait till I have 5 uninterrupted months to dedicate to hiking, I may never touch the AT. Piecemeal is second choice, but it’s something. Hope to make real progress in 2017.Made a few gear changes. Added a Tarptent Rainbow (1 person) for when I’m hiking on my own. On other trips, when one of the kids is joining me, will use our Double Rainbow. Tried to like an even lighter-weight tent, but decided to stay with a style I know works for me. I can put it up blindfolded.I changed my sleeping quilt from one that I think was rated to 40 degrees to a Revelation rated at 0 degrees. I was too chilly, even on 60-degree evenings (!), with the first quilt. Unfortunately I ordered the Revelation two weeks too late for this week’s hike, so instead am having to use an older, heavier synthetic bag that weighs 4 lbs. That will teach me to order sooner next time! I reduced about 1.5 lbs with small changes: a lighter-weight food/bear bag, a lighter weight cookpot for when it’s just me, and leaving out a change of hiking clothes for my short section hikes. Reduced from two portable phone chargers to one larger one. Reduced the quantity of first-aid supplies. Carrying lighter water bottles. Carrying more dehydrated/freeze-dried food and less of the heavier food I carried before. My food choices alone cost me an extra pound in July. Trying to forecast where good streams are, and refill more frequently, rather than carry as much water weight.I think being older has some cons in terms of weight carried.   We typically have slower metabolism, so one gets chilled easier and needs more external warmth at night. Our own internal furnace doesn’t burn as hot. This means a colder-rated sleeping bag and a higher R-value pad. (The positive of slower metabolism is that we don’t need to carry the crazy amount of food that a 25-year-old male requires, even when we’ve hiked all day.) When we were younger, we could fall asleep anywhere, on anything. But now, there’s a harder time conforming to a sleeping pad, and a greater need for restorative sleep. Some might benefit from a dedicated pillow and a wider pad. We need hiking poles that are strong, because partially worn knee joints are better preserved if we transfer more body weight to our poles when climbing and descending. Our walking is a little slower and more contemplative, because we know a hard fall could end our hike with a tear or fracture, not simply a bruise. To hike double-digit miles, we leave earlier in the morning and hike longer days. To reduce pack weight, we might leave some things out, such as a change of clothes or some electronics or cooking equipment or camp shoes. We trust that if we leave out too much, the world will still turn, and we’ll be OK, for there’s always a town ahead with things for sale. Just observations, not complaints. I am so grateful I’m still on this earth and that I have the health to hike.","None

Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550740,"Long day yesterday. Got away from work last evening 2 hrs later than planned, drove through nearly blinding rain, got to a hotel in Corbin KY by midnight. Drove the remaining 4 hrs to Neels Gap today. Such is the lure of this trail. Shuttled to the Visitors Center by Ron Brown in his Toyota 4-Runner with more than 400K miles. He says he changes the oil every 3 days at times. Nice man, very personable.Classic picture taken at the arch. Thought about all the people who had posed there or passed through there--right where I was standing--from Robert Redford and Nick Nolte to some of my most admired Trail Journals writers. Took the stairs up past the falls to the side trail for Len Foote Hike Inn. The best thing happened! I was counting the stairs, and must have messed up on the hundreds digit. When I got to the parking lot at the top, I thought I had 200 more stairs and was trying to figure out where they were. But I was done! The 5 miles to the Hike Inn were maybe 70% gentle uphill, 20% flat, and 10% downhill. A beautiful, warm, sunny day. Enjoyed a family style dinner, met some folks from Florida and Georgia, listened to a talk/slideshow of the manager's backpacking in Yosemite, and got a shower. I'm glad I came here. Mrs. Knobby said I'd like it and she was right.Tomorrow will enjoy breakfast here, then hike the 4.4 miles to the summit of Springer Mountain. Joining a friend of my daughter's there and then together heading for Hawk Mountain. Weather is supposed to cool down a bit.","Amicalola Falls Visitor Center

Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550888,"Met my daughter's friend at the top of Springer Mountain just before noon. I'd hiked from the Len Foote Hike Inn, 4.4 miles. (See Photo section for more pictures from the Len Foote Hike Inn.) Ron Brown shuttled him there from the Visitors Center. We took our pictures next to the plaque, and started north. It was perfect weather, cool but not cold. The fall colors were beautiful. There were places the trail was blanketed with leaves.Had planned to stay at Hawk Mountain Shelter, but we got there with another 2-3 hrs of daylight left, so kept going. The wind was cold and whipping at the tops of mountains, and much more quiet in the gaps. We talked of making it to Devil's Kitchen campsite, but light was fading fast by the time we got to Sassafras Mountain. Stayed at a campsite near 11.3 miles. Quickly put up our tents, boiled water, and ate Mountain House meals. When I came back to the eating area after getting something from my tent, he surprised me with a ""Happy Birthday"" display my daughter had sent! The big letters, all strung together--like you might buy for a child's birthday party--were perched next to a campsite log. I hadn't told him it was my birthday, but my daughter had. He'd picked up two Little Debbie cupcakes at Wal-Mart, and my daughter had sent a camp towel with him for a birthday gift. There have been a lot of birthdays that I've forgotten, but I'll always remember this celebration near the top of Sassafras Mountain.Inside my tent I was cold, but protected from the wind. Being in the tent and out of the wind warmed me by 10-15 degrees. I was cozy when finally in my sleeping bag, wearing two pairs of socks, two pairs of pants, two shirts and a windshirt, and my son's Army Polartec cap. Looking up through the tent, I could see the moonlight highlighting tree branches whipping in the wind. The wind roared as loud as ocean waves. It made a chaotic roar, not a rhythmic roar. Gusts of wind periodically woke me overnight, but amazingly it was still a good night's sleep.","Len Foote Hike Inn

Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550889,"Woke up about 6-6:30 a.m., but the wind at the top of Sassafras Mountain was still howling and gusting and cold. Didn't want to leave the warmth of the sleeping bag and the tent. Slowly started the day: letting air out of the sleeping pad, rolling up the pad and bag, packing things away. We boiled water for Mountain House breakfasts and coffee. On our way by 8:10 a.m.I've read many Trail Journals authors talking about layering and unlayering as our bodies get warm and cold. This was one of those days. Started out wearing a hat, two shirts, a windbreaker, gloves, and two pairs of pants. Even had my daughter's towel wrapped around my shoulders like a shawl. Before long, it's too hot with the shawl. Then the gloves come off. Then the windbreaker. Then the hat. Then the second shirt. By afternoon I'm down to my warm-weather hiking clothes.We stopped at Gooch Mountain Shelter and had a snack--peanut butter on thin bagels. Tasted fantastic. Kept going: Gooch Gap, Woody Gap. Threw trash away at Woody Gap, refilled our water from gallon jugs.I'm the slower one. Took two ibuprofen every 4-5 hours to make the knees a little happier. Put leukotape on blisters that had formed on the sides of my heels. Did decent speed if it was flat or gently downhill, but was deliberate and slow on steeper descents. On climbs, needed to stop and catch my breath and let my leg muscles recover every 30-40 feet. Regretted that I'm not free to just keep going, and gain endurance, before the next section. Will return to a fairly sedentary life, losing the muscle strength I started to form, before I start out again.About 6:30 p.m. we saw a milk jug weighed down with water, marking Henry Gap. It's true--no sign except for a milk jug with ""Henry Gap"" written on its side. A little trail to the left led to a deer trail with a flat area that could house both our tents. It was going to be dark soon, and we weren't confident we could soon find another trailside campsite. We were still in the forest, on the AT side of the Forest Service sign, but beyond the site we could see private property in the distance. We set up our tents, boiled water, ate our Mountain House meals, and were in our sleeping bags by 7:30 p.m. It was a quiet night. No howling wind like the night before. Got down to about 40 degrees. I was warm and slept as soundly as I've ever slept on the trail.","Sassafras Campsite

Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550891,"Was ready to get up at 6 a.m. this morning. Surprised at how well I'd slept. Had two packets of oatmeal and some instant coffee. Packed everything up, on the trail by 7:40 a.m. Still a little dark then, had my headlamp on.I'd been more intimidated by Blood Mountain than I needed to be. It was tough enough, but it could have been worse. It's a steep ascent, but the rocks are placed like steps for a good part of the way. One step up, walk flat a few steps, another step up, walk flat a few steps, etc. When you walk flat a few steps, you catch your breath. Much better than the mountains with the constant upward slopes, with no flat places to stop. The descent was trickier. Needed to be cautious with nearly every step. Plan where to plant the poles. Plant them. Plan where to plant the feet. Plant them. Over and over, for a mile or more. Found myself marveling at the hikers who descend Blood Mountain in the spring, when there's snow or ice on the rocks. I think I'd just sit down and slide.By 11:30 a.m we could hear cars and motorcycles below us, and by 12:30 p.m. we were standing in Mountain Crossings. My car was parked at the Byron Reece trailhead, just a quarter mile away. By mid-afternoon I was heading north, listening to a book on tape, eating KFC, drinking a diet Coke, and so very much regretting I had to leave the trail.","Henry Gap
