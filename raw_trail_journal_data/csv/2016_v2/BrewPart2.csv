BrewPart2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517989,"Trail leg acquisition will begin slowly and steadily April 4, covering 56 miles between Winding Stair Gap and Fontana Dam, N.C. This is peak thru-hiker season in the southern Appalachians but I have a system to help mitigate that issue: Forest Service maps, pre-dawn launches, flips, and an extra-special trail Goader.ATC-online once had a ""best time to go"" listed for each Appalachian Trail state. I'm not sure if it's still there but that's what helped me configure my flipflops.I'm tortoising at the start with an unrestricted schedule. Then onward and upward and downward, flipping at will: 1)Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont; 2)Katahdin whenever an early weather window opens; 3)New Hampshire, the rest of Maine; 4)Then a series of southward flips around the weather and the hiker bubble.      ",,View Entry,"Dec 04, Fri",0
BrewPart2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518185,"I picked the Northeast for the first segment of my FlipFlop because it's far removed from my Southeastern place. Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine will be new terrain for me. They'll peg me as not-from-there or ""from away."" I want to hear their unique Northeastern American accents before we're all homogenized. Off trail, I want to find hidey holes where the keepers of local culture hang. On this listen & learn trip, I'm all ears.",,View Entry,"Dec 05, Sat",0
BrewPart2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518214,"Both on trail and off, there's a rub between urban/rural, dependency/self reliance, consumerism/frugality, collectivism/individualism (and innies/outies, -door wise.) When people are drawn to the latter of each example, they're seeking the lifestyle. And then it changes the place. ""Leave No Trace"" matters to me and I'm prepping for it.LNT on the trail, yes, but I'm not a purist in any of the other categories. My trail Goader is knee deep in a collection of Delorme Atlas & Gazetteers, plotting the course of ins and outs on the trail -- so much for self reliance, huh?                  ",,View Entry,"Dec 06, Sun",0
BrewPart2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518238,"I'm ready to go, and thinking how the past brings me to today. When I was a mere pup starting my career in 1984, I married the woman now known as my trail Goader. My ten-years' senior coworker Wes said at the time, ""I'll give it a year."" After the first year he said, ""What I meant to say was watch out for the 2nd year, that's the worst."" His commentary became a tradition each year of my wedding anniversary. Wes retired in 1999 (the year of my 15th anniversary) with these parting words, leaping forward to cover the next half decade, ""It'll be over by the 20th year."" I love Wes. I hope he gets back on the Appalachian Trail. Last I heard, he had a pack shakedown at Neel Gap and they tossed out a cast iron fry pan, hibachi grill and a dozen cans of Dinty Moore. I thought about him this year on my 31st wedding anniversary.The first paragraph marked my final backward look, now onward. A bubble of good fortune has carried me through life, putting me in the right place at the right time. With some planning, maybe my hiking itinerary will be a continuation.    ",,View Entry,"Dec 09, Wed",0

Regards to all 2016 hikers including the creative independent-minded flippers out there.","
