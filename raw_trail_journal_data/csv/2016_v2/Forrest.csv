You might have heard on the news about the Noro virus on the AT. They have flown out numerous folks via helicopter over the last week. It spreads in the shelters where many people sleep in an open room in close quarters. Also, some hikers do not filter the water from the streams when they should. I always filter my water and I am not sleeping in any of the shelters. I sleep in my tent Out in the trail. I have antibiotics with me in case of something like this happening. I am doing ok.

Very cold.On the way up at one of the pull overs, people were stopped- a black bear was fairly close to the road. Closer to the Cherokee side we spotted about 10 elk having their morning breakfast of grass. Pretty cool. The goal Monday is to reach Tri-Corner Knob but we shall see.

Feeling great about the hike so far. Today is April 19 and I am at Deep Gap. I left Demascus Monday around 1:30. These next several days will be in the woods with no hostel, no small town, no shelter... This will be a real challenge to be in the tent for possibly 3 to 5 nights. I am trying to hike 15 to 20 miles per day now. One of the events last Thursday night, 4-14-16, was a bear attack; father and son were in a tent and the Bears went after their food. All ended well- no one was hurt. I was not at the camp but learned of the atack as we passed thru the following day. My hiking partner for the last week, Evan, stopped hiking at Demascus. He never planned to hike the full trail. His wife met us with lunch; he went home and I started out on the trail again. My next big goal is to make it to Harper's Ferry. This will be a big goal.

I have hooked up with several guys and we have been hiking together for a while now. We are sharing hotel and hostel expenses when we stay over night not in the tent. There is a young man 16 years old that has been hiking alone. He has support from his parents but was really getting lonely on the trail and homesick. He told us he was going to quit and go home.

We all were at the hotel and waiting on him to get there to go eat when we got a call from him. He was on the trail and could not make it; his knee just could not function any more. He was slack packing so he did not have his tent or warm clothes for the night. He was about a mile or so back on the trail. We were able to contact the trail rescue team which has a gurney on 2 bicycle type wheels. However, we have to provide the man power. 4 of us left about 10:30 last night with the rescue team to go back into the woods to look for DC. We were successful and made it back to the hotel with DC around 12:30 in the morning. A long night. His wife is coming down to pick him up.

Could have gone further but we all stopped for the day. The terrain was very hilly and rocky. Friday hiked 20 miles to Stony Creek. Staying the weekend at Mountain Lake Lodge in Pembroke, VA. This is the lodge where they filmed Dirty Dancing. A very cool place. Sherrie and I had dinner at the lodge with one of my new friends and his wife, Evan & Angie. We had bison burgers and wings.

Weather was fair when I started hiking in the morning but quickly turned into heavy rain and storms. Made it 15 miles and was able to get my tent set up. Slept in pouring rain and bad thunder and lightening storms. I was to meet Hooshr Monday morning but it didn't work out. We had no phone service and he wasn't able to park where we had planned. So, needless to say we didn't meet up until the end of the day. Monday was a tough hike- very rocky and with the rain off and on all day it was very slippery. Also, I had a very heavy backpack. I packed some extra items thinking I would see Hooshr at his car and could leave some things to reduce the weight of my pack but that didn't happen. I was tired from little sleep the night before and was carrying extra weight; probably one of my hardest days so far. But I made it. There are 2 hikers that live in Roanoke,Va. We have been slack packing this week; leaving one car at the end point of the hike and driving the other car to the starting point. It has been nice to stay with Evan & Angie this week; they have been most generous with their hospitality; allowing me to stay in their beautiful home. I can't thank them enough. Hooshr has been most generous as well; having hikers over for a nightly meal and one of his friends taking us out Wednesday evening for a nice dinner. This part of the trail is very rocky with very steep rocks to climb over and down and around; tough terrain to hike. It has been great to have a warm bed, a hot shower and home cooked meals this week. But, this too shall pass very soon. Look at the pictures of Dragon Tooth and Moose, Hooshr and myself coming down the rocks. Today, Thursday, I will be hiking 20 miles. Evan is dropping me off and picking me up later in the day.

We played whiffle ball and some chose to play beer pong; I skipped the beer pong game; needed to save my energy! A great place to stop if you are ever on the trail. During my hike the last 2 days, we passed The Guillotine; a large rock stuck between 2 bolders. A pretty cool site! I took a couple of pictures that are in the journal. Today is Tuesday, May 10th. I hope to break 800 today but we shall see; the first 5 miles are straight up hill which makes for a tough start. If not 800 today, I will be very close and will make it tomorrow.","Bryant Ridge Shelter

Passed a reservoir and several beautiful streams today on the hike. I hiked alone today for the most part. Moose went ahead of me. Hooshr and several others are a mile ahead so I may meet up with some of my buddies today. Mass and Rambo faced a bear in this area the day before so I was hoping to see my first bear but didn't happen last night or this morning. Of course I was alone so probably a good thing (or at least that is what Sherrie says). I want to see a bear; that is part of this adventure that makes it exciting. I still have a lot of opportunities. I am a little ahead of schedule; a little over a third of the way on the trail. But, not ready to say when I will finish. A lot can happen over the next 1367 miles. But, the good news is it is going pretty well so far. Hopefully my body will keep cooperating and let me finish this adventure.","Pedlar River

Paul picked us up in the afternoon at Beagle Gap. Paul has a large tent that about 10 folks can sleep in that he set up for the night and cooked supper for the group. However, I already had a room booked with free Marriott points in Waynesboro at the Marriott Residence Inn. Paul dropped me off at the hotel. I took advantage of a very nice place to stay and shower and sleep in a good bed. It was awesome. There was an Outback next door so it was a very good restful night for me. And, I shaved my beard; feel like a new man this morning. I would rate the hike between mile 848.2 to 866.8 a 4.5. A lot of rocks but a less difficult hike. Paul will pick me up Sunday morning and we will start at Beagle Gap. The plan is to walk 20 miles. The weather will be a bit brisk but ok. Mom and Hooshr are saying we will be at Harper's Ferry by next weekend; May21st. That seems crazy to me but looking at the book, it is pretty level terrain; not many high ups and downs so maybe they are right. We shall see how it goes.

There are a lot of campgrounds in this area of the Shanandoah National Park. Paul sets up the large tent and we all sleep in it in our sleeping bags. The nice thing about these National Park campgrounds are showers! Been able to have a shower everyday; seems simple but it is great! There are a lot of bear in this part of VA. You are not allowed to keep any food in the camp area. We have been putting our food in Pauls truck every day when we return to the campground. I would rate the hike between 885.6 to 927.3 a 4.5. This part of the trail is a pretty level terrain; there are climbs up and back down but not as steep as other areas of the trail. The group ahead of us has seen 18 bear in the last day or so. We have seen several but not 18. Just glad I have seen the bear; sounds scary but it is pretty cool to see them. Also, glad someone convinced me to keep my long johns with me when I sent all of my long pants home. I have needed them this week. A little less than 100 miles to Harpers Ferry, WV which is the half way point. Hope to be there the weekend or early next week. Going to visit my sister Jeannie and her family in DC.

So needless to say, we were soaking wet from head to toe. Mom's husband Paul was awesome. He picked us up and took us to a hotel which helped us all make it thru this cold and rainy weather. We left at 6:30 this Monday morning and will hike 12.5 miles to Harpers Ferry. This is where the Applachain Trail Conservancy is located and is considered the half way point. This was my next goal and I should make it. Our group of 5 will be splitting up at this point. I am headed to DC To meet up with John, my sisters husband.

The weather is getting warmer adding more challenge to the hike. At one of the streams, I took off my socks and shoes and put my feet in the water. It was very cold water but very refreshing; also washed my face off and put some of the cold water around my neck. We have passed so many historical spots this week; it is amazing. Being the confederate that I am, I know if I had been leading the troops we would have won the war! So many places to hide and approach the yanks without them knowing we were there. Oh Well! The hike goes forward! I would rate the last 2 days a 5.9. It is an easier hike but several places where we had to go over bolders and it was hard to keep on the trail; not marked very well so it was easy to get off track. We walked through several wheat fields; but a lot of rocks in this section of the hike. If you are hiking do not plan on staying at Ensign Cowall Shelter; it was nasty, dirty. People left their trash- the privy was terrible. The Raven Rock Shelter was very nice and clean; make it there if you plan to stay at a shelter.

I wasn't able to complete my half gallon but it was very good ice cream. I would rate this part of the trail about a. 4.2; fairly easy terrain to hike. It was a very interesting day.

We plan to be at Hooshr's friends house on Sunday which is close to NY City. My plan is to go into the city for one day. I want to see ground zero and a few other sites. Too close not to go. I have 817 miles left on this adventure. Right now I am feeling good and feel very positive that I can make it.

At mile 1385 there are very narrow rocks to get thru called the lemon squeeze. It last for about 20 yards; very tight to get thru especially with the backpack on your back. We are in New York and went thru a New York State park today that was beautiful; water falls and just really pretty terrain. After we made it thru the lemon squeeze, we had a rock to climb that was about 10 feet high. Had to throw my poles way up over the rock. I finally found a few places to put my fingers on the rock to pull myself up and then had to put my knee down to brace myself. It was a very tough rock to get over but Hooshr and I finally made it over. We will be in Palisades New York on Saturday the 18th. We will stay with a friend of Hooshr's.

Before leaving we walked into the small town for breakfast. Went to a place called The Buzz. I had the Kings breakfast; 3 eggs, sausage, home style potatoes and toast. It was awesome. I would recommend stopping there; very hiker friendly. Hooshr went to the local barber shop for a hair cut. We then took off for our hike. It was about a 4.5; another roller coaster - ups and downs but not too bad. There were some great views along the way. At one point, you could see the skyline of NYC. We also saw the Hudson River. When we got to Palisades, we had to cross a 4 lane highway to reach the visitors center; it was a very busy road. A friend of Hooshr's family, Martha, picked us up. We stayed at her home Saturday night. Martha cooked chicken on the grill, corn, salad, etc. it was a nice home cooked meal. Sunday we are taking a zero day; first day off in 25 days. Hooshr and I are riding the train into New York City for the day. Going to Ground zero and a few other places.

We made it into Peeksville, NY to the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center. There is a privy, community shower and water. They allow the hikers to set up tents on their ball fields. A great place. There were about 10 hikers here for the night. One of the hikers found a tennis ball so we found a stick and had a friendly game of stick ball. Something different to do than walking in the mountains; it was fun. As the weather gets hotter, the ticks come out.

They even have the best place to jump marked on the bridge. Hooshr and I with our elderly wisdom made the decision not to follow that tradition! We did not jump. Tortellia, the young hiker, made the leap. He survived but did scrape his toes a little but he is fine. As the trail goes thru the town, we came to another place to eat, Nazys. There we had fried tacos. They were awesome! We continued on the trail towards Norwich. There are warnings about bee holes in the ground along the trail.

It was very cold and windy at the top. I had to put on my heavy coat. This was our highest mountain before getting into the White Mountains which is in just a few days away. Going down the trail we saw our first moose! It was right at the trail so we had to be a bit careful going by. We are taking it a bit easy Thursday and Friday hiking into North Woodstock, NH. We have about 16 miles to get there in 2 days but we need to stock up and prepare for the hike into the White Mountains.

We normally average 2 mph but it took us an hour or more just to make a mile. But- the good news is we made our goal; just took a little longer. The views are beautiful!

You can stay there and work for your bunk bed. We got the left overs from supper and our work was washing the dishes; took about 30 minutes! There were plenty of left overs and washing dishes was easy. Nice experience. We had an easy hike on Monday but only went about 7 miles to the AMC Highland Center. A very nice lodge with bunk beds.

We were told this was a good area to see Moose but no luck. We made it 17 miles on Sunday; a long hike but good miles to reach the end. We stayed at the Carlo Col Shelter- Hooshr stayed in the shelter but I stayed in my tent. The big news of Sunday was we made it to Maine! Pictures to come later. We were up early Monday to continue the hike. This was a very tough day; 7.5. We made it to the Mahoosuc Notch - the most difficult or the most fun mile on the entire trail. I would agree with both titles. It was extremely difficult. I had to take my backpack off at times just to squeeze thru some of the boulders. Jump down, climb across for a full mile. It was very cool temperature as you got into the boulders; at some points you could see ice and snow down in the crevices. It was extremely cool, scary (and it takes a lot to scare me), dangerous but a lot of fun! The good news is we made it thru the mile and hiked 10 miles total for the day. We camped again last night. Up early again today, Tuesday 8-2-16, and off on the trail again. A long down hill and then up hill today. We made it 10 more miles so good miles the last 3 days.

We left out of Andover Thursday morning and wow, it was a tough hike. I would say a 7.3. We made good miles but it was tough. These last 2 days, Thursday and Friday, have been one of the toughest sections we have hiked on the trail. I am not sure if it is that tough or if I am just getting that tired; maybe some of both. But, I am feeling good and feel confident to make it to the end. Thursday there were a lot of ups and downs that were hard, not easy coming down. Friday was about a 5.4. A little easier. Hiking across a lot of rocks and the roots are back with a vengeance. I have named the roots the witches bones; they get your toes and walking on top of them wears on your feet badly. They are everywhere we hike in this section. We had trail magic on Friday! Hotdogs and homemade blueberry muffins with lots of fresh blueberries out of their backyard! Awesome! Today, Saturday August 6th, we are hiking into Rangeley,Maine. We only have a 9 mile hike today and as I have started a little this morning so far it is not too bad. Hope it stays that way... The weather was very cool when I started, but I am already wet from sweat. Humid, which seems odd to me being so far north in the mountains. However, it has been hotter here this summer than it normally is in this part of the country. But, that seems to be the way it is all over the country from what little bit of news I have seen in the last few weeks. I have been in my tent the last few nights but we will stay in a hostel with a bunk bed with sheets and a pillow tonight in Rangeley.

Most of the trail was in better shape than the last few days were but a few sections were rough with more roots to stump your toe and walk across. Doesn't seem that bad but walking on the roots for miles at a time is tough on the feet. See some of the pictures to see the roots. We climbed up 4 mountains today but managed this section pretty well. We were told it would be tough and it was, but not as bad as I expected.

If you happen to cross over onto their grounds they know it immediately and will come and have you move away.

Forrest,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546731,"A couple of years ago I began to toy with the idea of hiking the AT. Thinking it was only an adventure without realizing the magnitude of the task. I have had several life events in the past couple of years which opened the door for me to set out on this adventure. In my life time, I had only done a few day hikes with no overnight camping on a trail. I began the trip with small goals in mind; reaching NC and Gatlinburg. My buddy Rick said ""wow, you have walked all the way to Gatlinburg"". I was excited and felt accomplished until I looked at the map and reality set in of how minuscule the distance was in the overall scope of the total distance to be hiked. I would tent camp typically for 3 or 4 nights before going into town for a hotel room or hostel or bunk house. I very seldom stayed in shelters which is a 3 sided structure with a roof and a floor. I enjoyed the tenting aspect of the trip. I saw plenty of wildlife; bear, deer, snakes, squirrels, chipmunks, chipmunks, chipmunks, wild turkey, bobcat, grouse, salamander, beavers, otters and last but not least Moose! The spring time was the transformation of leafless trees to the budding of all types of beautiful flowers and plants that developed into the formation of the green tunnel. Virginia was my favorite State due to the diversity of the farms, mountains, the different trails - the dragons tooth, tinker bluffs, Mcafee knob; it is not to minimize the trails north of VA; the beauty of the Whites, New Hampshire and Maine. That brings us to Mt Katahdin; I would rate this final hike on the AT a 6.5; it was tough with a lot of rock climbing. It was awesome! A fabulous ending to a great trip. Now I have Christmas toes; numb with no feeling for Halloween, Thanksgiving- it will be Christmas when the feeling returns. I had 22 falls, many bruises and cuts, etc along the hike. I am a survivor and I survived it all. Thanks to the encouragement from many of my family and friends as well as trail journal friends and total strangers along the way. I began hiking with Hooshr in VA and we continued to hike together until the end. His knowledge of history and the trail were phenomenal and an extra bonus as we hiked the trail. Hooshr, thank you for your support and companionship along the way. It was instrumental for me in completing this task. A special thanks to my partner Sherrie who provided the ultimate support to help make this adventure possible. The AT hiker nation is made up of a diverse group of individuals who are very supportive, kind and very giving. If our country had more people with the hiker disposition and helping hand; resolving global issues would be an easier task. Stay tuned; more pictures and updates of life after the hike to follow!

I have enjoyed playing golf, body surfing and sitting on the beach; deep sea fishing planned for Thursday. No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problem by Kenny Chesney!","Mt Katahdin
