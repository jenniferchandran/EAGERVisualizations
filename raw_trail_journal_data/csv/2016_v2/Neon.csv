Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520207,"Here I am looking toward a 2016 hike. So far I'm thinking of starting at Monson Maine and heading SOBO, hopefully to tie into Franconia Notch and complete my AT trek from South Egremont MA to Monson Maine. I'm starting by looking into transpo options down in Maine. Monson does not appear on any of the leading bus lines so perhaps I'll be driving. I'm a bit concerned about my right knee which has recently decided to be swollen and sore. Well, I'll try giving it some support and see how that works. On go the ChoPats!

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520985,"I have to admit TJ is a great website. Kudos to the folks who developed and maintain it. Last fall I met a woman hiking SOBO on her way along the relatively little-know Eastern Continental Trail. She had started in northern Newfoundland (polar bears and all) and had set her sights on a deep southern end point. Wow. This woman is phenomenal. I actually had lunch with her the other day since she lives just a few hours away. Fantastic to have someone to talk trail with. Her story is amazing and I hope she writes it to all to read someday. Winter has finally arrived to my little hill town and we have snow at last. Snow and ice and wind and some below zero temperatures arriving for the weekend. As it should be. My knee is slowly recovering from it's mysterious problem and I've been getting out nearly every day for 3-8 miles. Feels good.In one sense my hiking plans are solidifying, in another sense they are getting more gauzy. It looks like a springtime hike is in the works for sure and it looks like Maine is the destination for a SOBO trek. The Which part of Maine and the Who is Hiking are the parts to be determined. It's entirely possible that my brother Stickman will join me for some time on the flats. That might mean the 100 Mile Wilderness SOBO from Abol Bridge. Or it might mean SOBO from Monson. Either one works for me and I'd be delighted to share the trail. We have the same tendency toward adventure and both enjoy the camping element of life, so all in all it would be a welcome addition to my plans. But I can't get too excited since he has to make the final decision. Looking forward to spring!",,Great Website,"Feb 11, Thu",0
Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522046,"What a glorious year for hiking! Today's temperature topped out at near 50, adding to the continuing warm spell that has been the theme of this 'winter'. Ground clear of snow and ice, mostly, streams full and bounding, lakes and ponds at their height. It's fabulous!I've entered my Training Time weeks; time to get ready to hit the trails. My training has boiled down to this: walk every day (no pack), bike at least 3x/wk to strengthen the quads (oh boy do they need help!), and add in riding the mare (not necessarily aerobic for me, but certainly stimulating at this time of year!) So far I'm booking in a modest yet respectable 25-30 miles of walking each week, mainly in the 5ish miles/day range. So far, so good! Knee holding up, feet ok, hip only occasionally flaring; it's looking pretty good, all things considered.Still don't know exactly when/where I'll begin, but it will likely be Maine and it may be early in May depending on weather.

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522174,"I find myself thinking back to my time – my trials - in the White Mountains. Those are not easy trails and I was just starting to get INTO them when I had to leave, having broken my ribs on a ‘minor’ slip coming down Wolf Mountain. One misstep can put the kibosh on entire hike, no matter how much preparation and planning is put into it. I recall my hike up South Kinsman in the rain the next day. Such a monster of a climb – large angular boulders slicked down with wet, snaking their way uphill to some invisible peak shrouded in fog, mist, and rain. The wind was having its way with my gear – turning my poncho into a wild untethered sail as I struggled to anchor it around my pack. It was dangerous to be climbing that trail that day with that body. In fact I’m confident that it’s dangerous to climb that trail any day. 
I remember being passed by Poptart as I struggled with my poncho. He was bounding up the hill and stopped long enough to greet me with “Hey I think this is a great trail!” before disappearing into the rain. Sheesh. I am constantly amazed at the ease and strength of young hikers.   They inspire me. Even so, my progress was much slower and most certainly much less elegant. I crept along, sliding on my butt, teetering on edges with my hiking poles flailing in all directions. It took me hours to reach the summit, averaging maybe 1 mile per hour. I recalled the group who left Eliza Brook shelter ahead of me that morning. It was a young couple thru hiking from Springer and her dad, a more portly fellow nearing my age, had joined them for a few days (in the WHITES!!!). I’m positive that he had a wealth of long-ago athletic experience and had kept himself in good shape over the years. But hiking the Whites is on some other plane of existence and he was looking somewhat battered after his first day. He stuck to a reasonable level of bravado, however, even though he was hiking with a deadline – had to reach his car in Franconia Notch by 2 pm. They had planned to leave the shelter by 6 a.m. but the rain pressed everyone’s get-up-and-go into a much soggier ugh-I’m-sleeping-in and they didn’t get moving until nearly 8. But the father talked confidently about the coming climb, figuring that after Wolf Mountain they could certainly tackle any climb without too much issue. 
That’s the thing about the trail – and yet another metaphor for life – you just never know what the next day will bring. On the guidebook map the climb up South Kinsman really didn’t look all that bad. Well. It was! I kept thinking of that trio as I climbed so so slowly up the hill, glad that I had no deadline weighing me down. I pulled into Lonesome Lake Hut after several minor slips and falls, starving, wet, and cold. Oddly my ribs hadn’t really bothered me much on the entire climb – I was probably in some kind of adrenaline-powered mind over matter zone – but at the hut the pain caught up with me and I fished out two Ibuprofen for support. I was so zoned out that I forgot to take them and left them there on the table as I thought only of getting off this hill and into a hot bath and a soft bed someplace. Such is the nature of the trail.
I have to admit that I am nervous about returning to the Whites. I know that whatever weakness I have will be magnified to the point of truth on those hills. It takes a certain amount of fierceness to get through those times. Fierceness, commitment, and stamina. Well. I’ll add those and a good dose of humility, slow-and-careful, deep breathing, and attention to beauty to my pack and see what happens.",,Looking Back/Looking Ahead: I'm Nervous,"Mar 01, Tue",0
Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523826,"Winter. Short days and long hours. My restlessness grows to near toxic levels. Walking out in the woods is a temporary balm yet I still have the urge to do SOMETHING different. I've polished off dozens of books, started and finished all sorts of projects, started and not finished several more, sold off unwanted gear, hung out with friends, played with dog and horse; the list goes on. All to avoid housework you ask? Well that's certainly part of the mix. The house remains at borderline cleanliness as I finally hit upon The Idea: I'm going to try to make myself a shelter. A tent. A tent to my own specifications. It must be light, durable, double walled, roomy, watertight, at least potentially free-standing, easy to set up and take down in the worst of weather, have a functionally large vestibule, and be remotely lovely to gaze upon. That's all. And so the fun has begun. I researched fabrics and took the expensive plunge into cuben fiber. I like that it doesn't absorb water so the rain won't soak into it and make it heavy. I bought camo cuben fiber, around 0.7 oz/yd in theory, but actually weighing in around 1.1 oz/yd. Not sure why the discrepancy but I'm willing to live with it. It looks and feels incredibly fragile, so I'm hoping it holds up. I got some silnylon for the bathtub but now I'm rethinking that and will probably replace it with cuben. I have been wantonly copying other products - trying to take the best features of the tents I like and come up with something similar but radically different. And true confessions: this is the hardest project I've ever undertaken. I'm taking it super slow. Everything matters; how to cut, how to attach (sew? tape?), how to put in the zippers, how to keep the seams on the net tent from coming apart, what order to do everything in so that it comes out right. Sheesh. Fortunately I have no deadline - really - since I THINK I can finish it by June for my section. So I work on it a little, put it down and think about what to do next and how to do it, take a few tentative steps in that direction and then stop again. Repeat process. It's a big task and I hope it comes out OK in the end. Even if it doesn't work out it's kept me busy these past few weeks as winter fades into spring. Whew!",,Blame it on Winter,"Mar 17, Thu",0
Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529022,"The tent is nearly done. I'll post pictures as soon as the last details are completed. I set it up in the wind the other day and was reasonably pleased. It evolved into at least an ""OK"" attempt, weighing in at 2 pounds on the nose. It is optionally semi-free-standing, can be set up with the fly on to prevent inner wetness during rain set ups, has plenty of room inside, reasonable vestibule room and two door side access. It is easy to set up and tear down and hopefully will be sturdy enough to last for hundreds of miles, minimally. That's the plus side. On the opposite side, while it's lightweight it's very bulky, so I'm thinking of making a compression sack to tame it down a bit. And I wish I'd made the bathtub sides taller. All of the other prototype imperfections will come clear with use. 
And speaking of use, it turns out that family is threatening to visit in June so my departure date is pushed up a few weeks and is now looming excitingly close. As a result I've laid out a training schedule that is going to keep me pretty busy in the final weeks before lift off. I've begun adding 10+ mile hikes with increasing weight each week, ending at 25 pounds and 4 10-ers the week before I leave. That should put me in position to at least have a fighting chance to succeed. Like any training regimen, it feels challenging at first then it begins to feel normal. 
Now I have to get the planning stage done. Section hiking has it's own challenges. It takes a lot of preparation and training for a hike that lasts only a month or so. But maybe that's the beauty; I'm always having to get ready for the next hike so I never seem to be able to 'let down' on my foundation training. 
One plus for this year is that I stumbled across a bounty of homemade trail food (Thank you Phoenix!!) at a very hiker-friendly price so my menu has rounded out nicely and I'm looking forward to hiking meals that don't feature only mashed potatoes as the main course. 
So the wild and crazy days begin! I've got so much to get DONE! Mid May is not too far away so wish me luck!",,Finishing and Starting,"Apr 21, Thu",0
Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531354,"Holy Cow! Things were so mellow just a few days ago. Since then I've moved my departure date up to less than two weeks, decided to use mail drops instead of dragging my security blanket (otherwise known as truck with camper) to Maine and points south, and discovered that my tent needs some last minute tweaks to prevent leakage. Well. It's forcing me to assemble my gear and sort out food (THANK YOU, PHOENIX!) for the next 5-6 weeks, list lodging and shuttle options at any/all major roads, decide where to cache food, get mail boxes filled, addressed, and ready to send, activate my inReach, load the Guthook apps and think think think over all the details so I'm not doing something really dumb like leaving my shoes behind. Yes, leaving my shoes behind, just like I did last year! Friends are calling, the lists are lengthening instead of collapsing and I KNOW I'm forgetting something. Luckily it's been raining nearly every day so I don't feel bad about spending so much time indoors on the computer or marching all of my gear back into the house after stuffing it in the camper with so much nonchalance.  So I'm sort of ready, but not really close to being ready, but getting readier every day. And how about that training program? Who's got time for that??!! I'm lucky if I get 10 miles a week at this point, let alone 10/day. Well. wish me luck!",,GAK!!,"May 04, Wed",0

My gear is semi-assembled, the tent is modified and ready to go, the animals are taken care of,got a haircut, packed my mail drops, and have begun trimming away the extra stuff I grabbed at the last minute thinking it would be great to have on the trip. Lavender bubble bath for zeros? No. More trail bars? No. Another pair of socks? Sorry. Sunscreen? Well maybe.Hiked up Monadnock on Monday and found out again why it is the 3rd most hiked hill in the world. Easy climb for 2000' and fabulous view. It was windy on top and I was happy to have both of my insulated jackets, my wool Buff, and a thick fleece hat. Almost got blown over a few tiems. Diane - BearBelle - joined me and we did a little bit of geocaching on the way down.

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535427,"Jer and I headed North yesterday and stayed the night at friend Jody's place in Unity Maine. Great visit. Maybe a bit too much wine and certainly too little sleep. Not quite on my game the next morning - Monday the 16th - as we drove the additional 1.5 hours north to Monson. We found the trailhead on ME 15 and Jer dropped me off in a brisk cold wind. Off I went! For some strange reason the data book that I had used to plan my trip gave me the mileage to the first shelter as just over 5 miles. In reality it was 9 miles and I chose to call it quits for the day. That little weirdness would act to confound me a bit in the days ahead. The nine miles were pretty unimpressive, flat (thankfully), windy, and even the occasional light snow and sleet. But I'll take it! I was surprised to find myself on a river bank looking at the trail disappearing into the water and reappearing on the opposite side of this cold-looking 20 - 30 foot crossing. Huh. Hadn't been prepared for this and now I'm wondering why I left my crocs at home. Dumb. Debated whether to go barefoot or keep my hiking shoes on. These shoes are new to my hiking repertoire - I usually hike in zero drop Altras. I wore the new hiking shoes across, and was thankful for the good purchase they gave on the slippery rocks. Then squish squish on the other side for the last few miles of the day. The shoes became fairly heavy with the water soaking - and this later came back to bite me. The water rose over my knees and was cold but not horrible. Got into the shelter around 2:30 which is just way too early. Made for a lonely first night. I'm not in my groove at all.","ME 15 - Monson

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535429,"Yesterday I ran in to a small group of trail maintainers. The trail has been very virginal in appearance - clearly the bubble hasn't yet arrived. Also met up with New Year, a young man who started the hike at Springer on Jan 1, 2016. Yikes! Hard for me to imagine that. Yesterday's river fording also came with a sign posted to a tree that informed me the Kennebec river ferry would not start operating until Memorial Day. Yet another detail I'd missed. Grrrr...Spent the morning trying to re-plan my hike based on the fact that a river crossing would cost me $50 since the ferry was not operating, and I was behind schedule by at least a day and likely to lose ground. Mulled over several options as I walked and finally decided to shuttle around the Bigelows from Caratunk to Stratton.Other than that, had a great hike. Except for bringing my summer bag and therefore shivering through last night all has been sort of fine. Just barely beginning to remember how to hike the AT but still out of sorts and foot sore. The trail today included several river fords so my shoes took beating after beating. My feet are pretty unhappy as well, and while I'm used to the mud and roots and rocks, I am doing a bit too much rock-hopping. Sent an inReach message home to have my warmer bag, crocs, and some wool socks sent up. New Year talked about finding good deal of ice/snow on the trail ahead - and me without spikes. Yet another missed detail.Got to Moxie Lean To and fell in love! It faces a lovely remote mountain pond - gorgeous! The wide flat rocks leading into the water invited me to take off my socks and shoes and spend a few minutes drying out. Ate lunch, found a deer skeleton, then packed up and moved on. Moxie bald was wonderful! The top was open, trees blown over and forming a landscape of skeletal white bare wood. It looked wind-blasted and wild. Great view too - all 360 degrees.","Horseshoe Canyon Lean To

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535435,"Absolutely froze last night. Shivered and then shivered some more. In the middle of the night decided to do the little-rehearsed 'pee in the cup' option whereby I don't have to leave the tent. Dumbass move! Evidently I have bad aim and after I was empty I found out the hard way that the cup wasn't exactly full. That created the midnight clean up event that makes a cold uncomfortable night even more ludicrous. But morning broke with a hint of sunlight (THANK YOU!). Oddly, my cell phone told me it was 1:00 a.m. on January 1, 2009 when I turned it on. I'm sure it didn't get caught in last night's flood, but that is weird. Saddled up feeling pretty good and set off toward Pleasant Pond. The hill crossing was the annoying sort - up down up down up down. I like an honest straight up. AWOL's guide mentioned beach at the shelter so I was inspired to just barge ahead and deal with the trail. The hill, when I finally got to the top, was relatively unremarkable after all that work. Saw a beautiful bird on the uphill climb. It was perched on a branch at eye level a few yards away. It was a grouse-like bird but prettier than the ones I've seen - brown and black and white with a bright red patch on its head. Fantastic. Finally struggled in to the shelter after a SLOW day. It took forever to hike the miles, partly because I spent a good bit of time sitting and studying the guide, calling Jer, arranging for a Caratunk-to-Stratton shuttle, studying the guide again. The downhill from Plleasant Mtn. was quite steep and my knees and feet feel pretty beat up. Three college kids pulled in during the evening - Clare, Bean, and another fellow. They seemed surprised and somewhat disappointed to see me in the shelter. They are sectioning to Monson and had huge packs. The young woman seemed tired out and I avoided mentioning the steep 1 mile climb they faced in the morning.Knees sore, beach had fishermen, out by 1 pm tomorrow for a day of rest.","Bald Mountain Brook LT

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535437,"Woke up to phone reading 8:00 a.m.   Yikes! I'd been planning to leave the camp at 8! I jumped up and got my gear stowed, figuring I'd skip breakfast and get moving. Then I tuned into the woodland sounds and realized it didn't SOUND like 8:00. Chedked time on my inReach. 6:30. Ahhhh....ramp down a bit. Took a big deep breath and settled in to a good breakfast. Cleaned up, packed up, pushed on, passing two tents containing my neighbors. The trail was very sweet, even with a river fording coming up quickly. It was soft and wide, finally leaving the muddiest parts of the trail behind. There was plenty of downhill too, which turned out to be ugly for my right knee. Every step became a problem. This knee had been acting up for months but I was treating it well and trying hard to stay in denial about it but yesterday's gleefully quick downhill seemed to be the last straw. I tried changing my foot plant, angling my body differently - nothing worked. Painful.As I limped through a lovely part of woods I noticed a large hawk about 20 feet above me in a tree. Not hard to locate her, since she began screaming at me non stop. She kept up the racket - clearly upset that I was in her territory. I couldn't see any nest or babies in the area, but they must have been there. Then whooosh! she dived bombed me. Whoa! And whoooosh! again. And again. OK. I struggled along as fast as I could. Then WHUMP! she hit me hard on the head, sending my hat flying about 15 feet down the trail. Ouch! I'm glad I had the hat for protection or the slight scratch and bleed I got would have been much worse. I finally limped into the parking lot at 201, inflated my pad and took a 2 hour rest before being picked up by a shuttle from the folks who run the Stratton Holel. They also own and run the Farmhouse Inn in Rangely and are WONDERFUL. My knee was quite wonky by then and I was glad for the hawk attack story to keep us laughing. Checked into the Spillover Motel and signed up for a zero at the Stratton Motel the next night. Have to see what's up with the knee. Reports from Shane (shuttle driver) indicate the Bigelows are very icy and dangerous so I'm glad I got the shuttle and missed them.","Pleasant Pond LT

By the end of the day I'd decided to go on and try out the next part of the trail. Stacey and Shane, owners of the Motel and Inn, have a great support system so I knew I could get a shuttle to bail out if needed at almost any point between Stratton and Rangely. Met up with Einstein and arranged to leave together (he's a NOBO thru hiker who started Jan 14) in the morning after breakfast. I picked up my box with crocs and cold weather bag and refitted my pack. Plan to be on the trail by 9 the next morning, heading south. A group of 11 4,000 foot club folks in the hostel for the night.

I took it really slow, taking in the (limited) views and noticing the red trillium growing in abundance along the trail side. The north summit was a bit of a non-event and the south summit not much more impressive. The downhill, however, was close to hair-raising! Steep down leading to open shale scree, leading to more steep down until it finally evened off a bit and emptied out onto a woods road.

Oddly, it felt better almost immediately and yet today, my first day back, it began to throb again fairly soon into the walk. I'm beginning to wonder if the ChoPat knee brace I use to help stabilize the knee and protect it from misalignment is the real culprit. I have loosened it as an experiment.The trail is a rather steep uphill to Spaulding Mtn summit from the point I left a week or so ago. I had planned to hike north from Stratton and go over the Bigelows heading to Caratunk to fill in the gap I shuttled around to avoid snow/ice problems, but that trip would double my shuttle expenses and so I decided to head south instead. Hopefully I can get at least to US 17 or beyond. So I'll miss the swim, BonBon! I loved your notes, Kat and BonBon - thank you for your support; you inspire me!There was one point on the trail to the summit when the mountain opened up and I got a tremendous view of the valleys below. There were wildflowers blooming on trail shrubs and the whole area was purple and lovely. Heaven!The downhill was hard on the knee. I took the ChoPat off completely. It seems to help to do this but not sure. Got to Spaulding Mtn. shelter - the last shelter that Inchworm was known to be in before she went missing a few years ago. I just read some of her published journal notes and was astonished to find she had survived for nearly a month. There is no possible way she should have died. The details that have been shared regarding her trip and her last days are troubling. Why was a woman who was known to have a poor sense of direction in the woods evidently either without a GPS or compass/map or without the knowledge to use them? Why was a woman alone in the woods who was so anxious about being alone that she was on medication? These things just don't make sense to me.But speaking of alone, here I am again; alone in the shelter. I am hopeful that I'll run into SOBOs or the occasional NOBO so that the lengthy afternoons I have in campsites can be shared with conversation. So far the hike has been solo to the extreme.","home

It's great hiking with too solid legs! The trail was a honey today. Soft footing on a long downhill then lastly a kick ass up to the shelter. Nice shelter too - new floor and a nice brook right out front. I set up a big lunch and ate it all. Since it was only 1 p.m. I tried to decide if I should push on and try for US 4 or Saddleback or just get to the nearby campsite or just stick to my plan and stay put. There is rain in the forecast for tonight and tomorrow which makes the shelter look tempting. But it's only 1 p.m.! I'm discovering that these long summer days are perfect for hiking long miles. Unfortunately I am good for 10-13 miles max and that means I am spending a lot of idle time at campsites wishing for company. I usually hike in the fall when days are short and there tend to be more folks on the trail. Decided to push on to the campsite. That would put one more ""up"" behind me today, leaving just two for tomorrow instead of three.I've set up my tent using a platform for the first time. On the way here I passed a tree with fresh bear sign on it - they scratch and bite the tree, leaving marks that establish their territory. I took a picture of the tree then stepped back and noticed another, then another and another and found that nearly all the trees in a line perpendicular to the trail were marked. Freshly marked. Whoa! The great thing about black bears is that they are not keen on being in the same space as humans; they typically will avoid us or run away if they wee us. But it's so early in the season that the AT here is not yet established as a human highway so it is more likely that I'll encounter a bear. But I didn't, though I admit I kept moving along!

Woke to a dry tent, surprisingly. Got up, finally, at 5:30 and began to tear down. Started the dreaded oatmeal breakfast - horrible slimy stuff - and was off by 6:30. The climb was a steep 1000 feet but there were views northward with fog rolling in like surf against the hilltops below. So pretty. At times I could see above to the open bald. Inspiring. Couldn't seem to get into high hear today for some reason. Knee is in good shape. Got almost to the top of Saddleback and had to fuel up. The oatmeal got me over the Horn but couldn't get me all the way up. The hike was actually a honey - an open bald leading across an open saddle to the bald summit. I enjoyed it. As I approached the windy, foggy summit I dug out my phone and called Jer and a friend to chat. As soon as I reached the summit I planned to phone Stacey from the Farmhouse Inn (GREAT PLACE!!!) to arrange a shuttle from 4 to the Inn. But the phone screen seemed so dim I thought I'd mistakenly changed the settings somehow so I found the setting screen for brightness, tried to make the screen brighter and then OOOOPS! managed to completely turn off the screen. No screen! That meant no phone, no GPS - Yikes! I had to laugh at my clumsiness, but in reality it was a valuable lesson in gear use; don't attempt to change things you don't know how to change! But luckily the trail was well marked and I'd studied the days' march well enough to know what would be coming. I'd just get to 4 and stick out my thumb instead of getting a shuttle. And so I did. Except that the trailhead on the road had no parking and the road had no shoulder so I ended up walking a short distance to the Hikers Hut and mellowed out there until I caught a ride back to the Farmhouse Inn and my camper.

It cuts through the parcel south of Rangeley Lake and connects US 4 to Route 17 to the west. I heard there was rain in the forecast and got a reasonable start around 9:30 in the morning with a shuttle to the trailhead. The day was warm and sunny to start, getting cloudier as time went on. My knee was perfect. No worries at all. Still alone on the trail, there were no spectacular views of valleys, but some great views of the area ponds. I was excited to think of camping at one of these and pulled in at Sabbath Pond LT just after the rain started. Set up for the evening in the LT, fetched water from the pond in a sharply blowing wind, and spend the rest of the day/night listening to the rain on the metal roof and sleeping. Maybe it's my extended loneliness, but the sound of the rain on the metal roof at times sounded like voices. Damn! I'm hallucinating!

I think I do better when I have shorter hiking days that fit my distance capabilities better. I also do better when I have some sort of company. Hiking alone is fine. Camping without company for extended periods without much to do beyond writing and reading is not appealing to me. I'm not scared of the woods - I'm just lonely and that is my Achilles heel.I did not put in my typical miles, but I discovered that my ChoPats can be a help and also a hindrance and I'm glad I figured out what they were doing to my knee.

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538837,"I've been home for a few weeks now. The very odd thing about being home is that it is a bit isolating for me. I have no hiking buddy to share stories and memories with except for Stickman and since he couldn't go out this year he isn't keen of hearing about the adventure he missed. I understand.But the truth about hiking is that the trail is always a teacher for me. I always take away a nugget; a treasure. This year's truth is that I could have kept going. That is; I had coverage for my chores at home and I had the resources to continue my trek. At one point on my last night, as I was listening to the rain pounding on the metal roof of the lean to, I made myself consider what it was that I wanted: go on ahead, or stop. How would it feel to go on? What would I feel like if I went home? This exercise was liberating in a sense. I realized I could be hiking if I wanted - or not - but that the goal for me was not in the miles accomplished but rather in the sense of enjoyment I gleaned from the hiking itself. Oddly, I gained a sense of competency from that realization. Odd because even if I decided to stop, I still felt like I was in charge of that decision; that I could choose to stop rather than being forced to stop as had so often happened in the past. It was freeing. In the end I did decide to stop. I was very lonely and that loneliness was bothering me. For safety and companionship I would love to find a hiking partner.

America, been to the Himalaya, been through an avalanche (just a bloodied face, thankfully), and gone all over the planet looking for fun and adventure. He hiked the Milford Trek in NZ a few years ago. So why not stay local and see what the AT has to offer? He thinks he might be able to get 2 weeks a year from this fall. We'll start at route 17 in Maine and head south so he'll get to finish the southern Maine hills and traipse across the whites. And I get my hiking companion.

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545223,"Mt. Washington hike day started EARLY. For me, that was a normal day since I am a morning person. For the rest of the crew - UH OH! My nephew Jason arrived the day before, completing a 3 week, 9,000 mile ramble through the US state parks in a van loaded with his sister and two of their adolescent neices/nephews. Imagine! Yikes! Kudos to Big J for his stamina and patience! Then Ariel and Ryan missed their flight in SF and had to take the red-eye east to Hartford, arriving at midnight our time and then driving an hour and a half home to catch about an hour or two of sleep before Jason and I shook them out at 6:00 a.m.. Does this sound like a likely crew for the big climb? Hardly! But Ariel and Ryan slept in the van as Jason drove - yet again - the 4 hours up to Pinkham Notch. We caught breakfast at a truck stop along the way so we were well and truly fueled for the journey. It was about noon when we started out up the Tuckerman Ravine trail. The trail was wide and relentlessly sloping, but not difficult at all as we finally got to the mid way point. We were rewarded by a Moose cow and her young calf calmly munching the browse along a small pond at the mid point near a USFS outpost. There was a wooden fence separating the trail from the pond and she gradually munched her way right up to the fence, putting her about 3 feet from the actual trail. That was a bit chancy, considering the calf nearby, but we sneaked by and warned a downhill couple to maybe hold their dog in order to prevent Angry Mother Syndrome and a bad outcome. After the midpoint the trail became much steeper and soon we were facing the magnificent bowl that is the Ravine itself. The rest of the climb was an ever steeper meander up the wall of the ravine. Ugh. I could feel my butt getting kicked by this hike. Hiking with the family is incredibly wonderful and it's also a relatively fast hike for me. If I'd been on my own I'd have had more down time to rest and enjoy the view, but here I was merely the last hiker, and so I tried not to be too much of a straggler. We marched up and up and UP and UUUPPP! Despite the weather threats of thunderstorms we had good weather, though hot and humid, for almost the entire hike. We finally got to the crest of the ravine. The trail to the summit stretched a half mile or so up to our right and the trail to the hut continued straight. We marched on to the hut; I couldn't imagine climbing any more for a while. We met about a 40 mph breeze at the crest and loved it the whole way down to the hut. Cool and refreshing. We got in to the hut around 4:30 and got our bunk assignments. We had a short break before dinner so we spent the time exploring the lakes (yes! actually small ponds at this 6,000+ foot elevation!) and listened to one of the Croo talk about the wooden framed packs they use to transpo food and trash to/from the summit. Then in to dinner. We met some folks from Israel and from MA who were very nice. I was impressed at how many families there were there - some with young kids who I guess had hiked up as we did. Amazing. Hats off to those families!After a night of very little sleep it was my turn to be dazed and tired, but shortly after breakfast we got to the summit and enjoyed a leisurely hour or so in the visitor's center. The weather was socked in fog after a night of thunderboomers and hail, so no view, but the incessant wind was pushing us around. I checked out the museum, bought a tee shirt ""This Body Climbed Mt. Washington"" and noted a couple in wedding dress and tux who were, yes, getting married outside on the summit. In the rain. With the wind and approaching thunderstorm. OK then. To each thier own!We decided to go down via the Lion's Head trail. More steep at the bottom , that was the kind of trail you would take your date on if you never wanted to see them again. But not to break my string of misadventures, I fell in a rocky part of the trail, landing on my prosthetic hip and giving both of my shins a serious barking. Result: only some monumental bruising. My only regret is that I never got photos of the bruises - they were indeed massive. But by then we were only a mile or two from the parking lot so no worries. Down we went, in the rain finally, with thunder rumbling overhead. All in all it was a very difficult climb with glorious views on the first day.

Turns out there is a person in town who was spotted with a backpack on a few weeks ago - she had done a little overnight in the local state forest where there is a small shelter on the Monadnock/Metacomet Trail. Well that sounds like a hiking partner! So I asked her if she wanted to go out with me in November and she actually got excited! Too much! So the tentative plan is to hike the AT through Connecticut the first week in November. So totally do-able, and a nice way to get started on the AT. Works for me!AND THAT'S NOT ALL! I ran into an old work buddy who was having dinner with his wife and - who would guess - she said she spent this summer looking around for a backpacking partner. What???!!! OK.

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551431,"Back on the trail on a beautiful day. The sun is out and so are my spirits. I’m trying out the ULA pack and also experimenting with sleeping pads. The trail begins across a farm field on the flats then enters the tree line and starts to climb. So here it is; the uphill that is so challenging and the view that is so motivating. I feel the heat building up. I’m sweating and panting and grateful for the switchbacks. I am humbled already. The climb reaches a bald called the Jug End with a great view of the world below. Hillsides of orange brown, fields of green and tan, and houses like toys spread out below. Feeling rushed, though, since I’m trying to make it to Sages Ravine Campsite for a long first day. I struggle up Mt. Everett and even more on the downside, hoping my knees hold up. The ‘trick’ is to keep them always at least slightly flexed so the force of the motion is taken up by the springy thigh muscles, especially on the downhill when the tendency is to extend and stiffen the leg. Thank you Jeff the PT guy! The longer the shadows the more nervous I got! I began to wonder if I’d make it to Sages Ravine after all. It’s actually pretty warm. I’m sore and tired and my day ends at Laurel Ridge Shelter, two miles short of my goal. I figure I can try to make up the miles tomorrow on a flatter section of the trail. It’s weird to set up camp the first time. I have to think before I do anything. The transition from my easy civilized lifestyle to camper takes thought. I’m glad I decided to quit early because the daylight begins to fade rapidly and I didn’t want to spend my first night fumbling around in the dark. The tent sets up well on the ground and the tent platform works well as a table. The spring is dry so I trek back to the brook to fill up water. Beef concoction for dinner. Most excellent. My pad experiment was to use my ¾ length inflatable on top of my older thermarest zline. Well, that configuration felt like sleeping on a balloon perched on a narrow branch; every time I moved it felt like I would fall off the pad.

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551432,"Woke to a breezy morning in my cozy tent. Today was to be a long haul but not too hilly. My thighs were a bit sore, but that worked out early into the hike. The trail from the campsite was mostly somewhat downhill and after a few miles crossed into Connecticut. Making progress! But Bear Mtn. lay ahead to slow me down. At close to 1,000 feet, it is a gradual climb at first then gets into serious elevation. It was like a mini New Hampshire! This climb surprised me since my general impression of CT was that it was on the not-so-hilly side. Ugh. This not-so-hill kicked me in the pants! I was grateful to finally get up the rocky face to a stone hut near the top and then to the top itself. It was marginally gratifying to discover a sign there that stated Bear Mtn was the highest peak in CT at maybe 1,700 feet or so. I stopped long enough to take some pictures and headed out. Walked along a gorgeous ridge line with fantastic views of the valley below. The sun was getting low, giving the landscape that golden glow. Wow. I’d better hurry! I had filled my water bottles up at the campsite in the morning and passed one brook with a good flow but didn’t top off my water. This turned out to be a mistake. Even though the AWOL’s guide said the campsites had stream or spring water, I found none. And then I ran out. Nothing worse than hiking in warm weather and going dry. This was to be my long day and I was beginning to get worried about finding water. My goal was Limestone Spring Shelter but I figured I still had maybe 3.5 miles to go – which felt like 350 miles to my dehydrated legs. I began to pass sites that were labeled with signs but not mentioned in the guide and that made me even more worried. Where was I, exactly? I really missed having Guthook with me but for some reason couldn’t find anything but the free app that isn’t so useful.I finally got to the blue blaze trail to the shelter and it was listed as 0.5 miles in! What?! Then I discovered that nearly half of that distance was a steep, rocky descent along dry dusty drainages. Need water! I made it down after a lot of slipping and sliding, formulating a plan in case this camp was dry. No water? I’d head out to a nearby road and get into town somehow and drink all the water I could beg. But when I found the shelter I found a jug of water waiting. The spring for this shelter was still running, albeit at a slow drip, and keeping a jug filling constantly would keep my water bottles full.I was completely exhausted, but revived a bit by the water, decided to camp in the shelter. Spent the night listening to the mice frolic across the metal roof and through my gear. They sounded like monkeys. No internet so no election coverage. I’ll have to wait until tomorrow to find out who wins the election. Day 2 is over.","Laurel Ridge Campsite

And really, if you count the half mile I had to haul my backside up out of that shelter this is really a 12 mile day. Sound cranky? You bet! Woke to grey skies with drizzle predicted, climbed slowly back up the steep incline to the white blazes, and learned that Donald Trump is to be our – gulp – our head honcho. I can’t say the “P” word along with his name; it is way too depressing. I marched along in a haze of thoughts, trying to pull some positives out of the news. The miles passed by, the rain started, and I kept trudging onward. It was an ‘easy’ day with no remarkably challenging terrain. I’d planned to hike to Sharon Mountain Campsite and enjoy a nice warm lunch but the stream was dry and I didn’t want to use up my water by making a hot soup lunch. Finally got to Pine Swamp Shelter and set up my tent. No more rodents for me – I need a good night’s sleep. The shelter is situated above two separate swamplands that are connected by a few streams. One of these was flowing so I had plenty of water. It was a nice site and once again I was the only person there. There was a brisk wind and a light rain so I slid into my bag by 6 and read for a bit before texting my son then talking with him on the phone.

My water bag had ice but luckily my filter hadn’t frozen and I was able to set up some hot tea and the dreaded oatmeal for breakfast. Wish I could find a better breakfast alternative. I know all about pop tarts. There must be something better out there, but I chickened out at dehydrating raw eggs on this trip. At any rate, I looked at the guide and saw this short day only had three hills to challenge me and none of them looked terribly difficult. After packing up the tent (still damp) and rejoicing that I didn’t have to pull on my stiff and frozen socks – only shoes - I got underway. My legs felt good, my knees happy when I keep reminding myself to flex them with every step. I fell into a positive mood of just being profoundly grateful for my life. I’m grateful for my health and sturdy body that lets me undertake these adventures, grateful for my family who support me during them, grateful for the beauty of the natural world around me and the fantastic weather I’d been having. I’m grateful for my strong heart and relatively sound mind and grateful for my many good friends. Even small hills can seem difficult when I’m tired. As I neared the top of the first hill I suddenly had the pressing desire to get to the top, no matter if the trail went there or not. I WANTED that top! I flew up the last few hundred feet, smiling and happy to see the trail was obliging me with a summit. The view was modest and not clear, but at this time of year the woods is extremely open since there are no leaves on the trees and I could get a good sense of accomplishment. The remaining two hills passed quickly and then I was on CT 4, turning left toward Cornwall Bridge. It’s a short walk from the trail and the road goes over the Housatonic River and a train track. It swings southward and passes a package store.   I stopped to see if they had any GF beer. Yes. Oboy! There is an outfitter next door that stocks items mostly for fishermen and I mean fisherMEN. I bought a pair of long john bottoms – mens – and a few batteries, then skipped across the street to the market where a short order counter served me up two burgers in no time. On the trail I met hiker Hicks going NOBO for the day. We talked and I offered him my contact info for joining up on possible future hikes. You never know. He was a very nice guy and one of the few people I’d seen in my 3.5 days out. After lunch I stopped in at the Hitching Post Motel and got a shower, laundry, my mail drop, and a beer. Perfect. Feeling pretty good. Packed up some stuff to bounce home and took it to the post office. I will be meeting up with FB hiker friend Amy ‘Mrs. Joy’ today and she was just checking in when I got back from the post office. A remarkable woman, she kept up a lively conversation as we had dinner together in nearby Kent. It was good to get to learn more about her and our parallel lives and mutual interests and friends.

I stashed some unwanted gear – including my zline pad that never worked out – and my pack in Amy’s car and she dropped me off at the AT trailhead on the south side of CT4. My job was to go up and over the hill and then meet her on the south side when we would take up the trail together. As I hiked upward I thought about all of the people who had taken these same steps, from Earl Shaffer and Grandma Gatewood to Mrs. Joy and BonBon and thousands of others. It was a wondrous sensation, fulfilling and uplifting, even to do a tiny fraction of their efforts.Amy and I met up and off we went, marching close to 5 miles along the Housatonic River. We chatted as we went and the miles passed quickly. Then we hit the ledges. We split up to tackle this rock pile. It was a grand struggle for sure, and treacherous partly due to the slippery leaves that hid the rock faces. At one point I slipped and fell forward, my pack pushing my face into the rock. Ouch. Bruised on chin. Sigh. But upward and onward. I waited for Amy at the top but was getting cold in the breeze so once she caught up with me we agreed to meet up at the Mt. Algo Shelter. That shelter was a short way up a good water source and I went on a bet that the shelter would have water so I wouldn’t carry it uphill. Sure enough, there was a slowly moving stream that seemed more like a series of puddles in the rocks. Good enough for me. Amy did carry her water up. What an Amazon! She drove 8 hours to meet and hike with a complete stranger, had a marginally good night’s sleep, hiked over 9 miles carrying more than 20 pounds, and hauled 3 liters of water up a steep grade. Kudos! AND she lives up to her name. We set up our tents and settled down, just the two of us in the campsite. The weather forecast was for plenty of cold so I dressed in all of my clothes: 2 sets of longjohns, 2 pair of socks, pants, two jackets, a Buff, and a down hat. Oh. Forgot the wool gloves.

At around 1 pm we sit down for a munch break and I check my watch. Oooops. I start to get anxious about long shadows and dark trails. Amy calls it the ‘need to get back to the barn’ syndrome. She’s right. I start off alone and keep the pace up long enough to realize that I might have over done it. Slow down, Beth! OK. I slow down a bit and meet up with a troop of boy scouts heading northbound toward Mt. Algo. There were maybe a dozen kids with half a dozen adult men herding them. I took the time to congratulate them on their journey – their packs were as big as they were themselves! They were planning to meet up with another pack of scouts hiking in SOBO for a big camporee. I breathed a sigh of relief that I wouldn’t be camping among them and hiked on. I got to the 10 Mile River and discovered that campsite was also under a boy scout invasion. Wow. Regroup. I waited for Amy, checked out the options, and when she met up we decided to stealth on a flat patch by the river.

Since it was only 2.5 miles from the parking I decided to return to get it. My dog Ruby and I went out yesterday to do that. It was mildly showering when we started, then it began to MONSOON once we were out and kept monsooning for the rest of the walk. We went as fast as possible but were still out for over 2 hours. The campsite was a stealth site by the 10 Mile River and I felt confident I'd find the kindle. Had to cross the river first. There is a steep stairway of metal treads that aren't solid metal on one side of the bridge over the river. Ruby said 'no' to the stairs. I crossed the bridge and finally waved and whistled enough to get her attention to show her I was across the river (she is so damn blind!) and she SWAM across. What a dog. So brave. I was so proud of her. The kindle was exactly where I thought it would be. Grabbed it, shoved it into my soaked pants pocket, and turned back toward the parking. Had to cross the river again but this side of the bridge had easy access so Ruby came across the bridge with me. But there were those stairs again on the other side. I carried her down and she was tail-wagging appreciative. We practically ran the 2.5 back to the car. There wasn't a square millimeter on either of us that was dry. I was able to wipe her down and then get the heater going. I peeled off my top layer, replaced it with a shirt I'd brought, and took off my wet shoes and socks. I thought about getting out of my wet pants, but by then I'd soaked the seat and figured it was dumb to get my dry pants wet on the seat so I left the wet ones on. By cranking the heat up to 90 the whole way home, and draping my jacket across the passenger seat and the steering wheel I could dry it out enough to be able to wear it by the time I had to stop for gas. The pants mostly dried by just being worn in a hot car. The rest of my clothes were dripping puddles when I finally got home and hung them up, but I felt mostly warm and glad to re-unite with my kindle.   Call it a lesson in discipline: know where everything is and be careful about scanning the campsite, especially in stealth sites covered with autumn leaves.
And speaking of lessons! Gleaned a few others from this trip: 
1. Eat more salt! Who knew? I'm not much of a food salter, yet I get a fair amount of exercise and am usually sweating freely as I work. At the same time, I've been plagued by horrible muscle cramps for several years now. They rarely occur in my calves, but attack my thigh adductors (so painful!), torso muscles, hands, fingers, and feet typically. On this trip I randomly added a few packets of salt to my meals and went from cramping at every slight movement to having no cramps. What a difference! It's a miracle!
2. Forget piling one pad on another. Even the relatively thin ZLine pad was too much for the inflatable. I did have a few problems with the inflatable getting too cold, but not enough to warrant a thick foam pad. Amy had a super thin pad that would add to the R value of the inflatable and maybe that's the answer. Or get a down inflatable. 
3. Add soup. Even though I carried some great dehydrated meals home made by Phoenix, in every case they were made more perfect and more substantial by adding a packet of dried soup. I would mix water, dinner, and soup together, heat to a simmering boil, then let sit in my pot cozy until all of the water was absorbed. Super filling, hot, and very tasty. I used thicker soups like the creamed soup mixes. Perfect. And hats off to Phoenix for her culinary arts. The dried broccoli was heaven.
4. Keep those knees flexed! Never needed my knee braces at all. Now THAT'S an improvement. My weaker right leg (arthritis and hip replacement created muscle loss and subsequent weakness) is getting stronger and more muscled too.
5. Partner up. Hiking with Amy was really awesome. We didn't spend every step together which was fine, yet we were well matched. It was great to spend the evening with another person - keeps the evening filled with chatting and sharing and makes the day much more three dimensional. Amy was an excellent companion with endless stories and a fun personality. She enjoyed smelling the roses. 
6. Rain gear. Well, the jury is still out on that one. The Packa sort of worked, but made a lot of internal condensation. My cuben fiber poncho may be the winner in the end, despite having to wrestle with getting it on over the pack and it's tendency to blow all over in the wind. Final decision is still out.
