She's a believer.","

Microstride,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/426304,"Did a test hike on part of the Paumanock Trail on Long Island. I got horribly lost because of poor blazing. I didn't have a very good map either. I was planning on a 3 day hike from the Pine Barrens Trail Office on County Road 111 and the LIE heading towards East Hampton. I'd done the Montauk Point to East Hampton section years ago, and was hoping to knock out this center section. The nearest water was a good 20 miles from where I started, so I couldn't really afford to dilly dally. But after getting off on several wrong trails it was obvious I wasn't going to make it to water before the end of the day. So unfortunately I had to abort until I get a good map.","
