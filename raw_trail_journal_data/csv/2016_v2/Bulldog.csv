Anyone needing shuttle service between Atlanta and Fontana I highly recommend his service.Arrived at the Springer terminus at 1:30, hung around and talked with some day hikers out enjoying the beautiful sunny day and then I was off on my hike.   Stopped for the night at Stover Creek where I met two fellow thru hikers, No Trail Name Yet and her dog, and Crazy    Tree whose ten year old son Dawson is hiking with him for two days","Home

Bulldog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554200,"A few rain drops overnight, just enough to get the tent wet. Got a late start at 9:15,had hoped to start at 7.
Hiked most of the day with Crazy Tree and Dawson. The day started out cloudy with a few rain drops through the morning. We stopped for lunch and the temp took a noticeable drop and an additional layer was added. 
The big climb today was Sasafrass Mountan and as we began the climb the sky cleared and the temperature must of reached 60.
After we descended Sasafras I had my first Trail magic. Crazy Tree's wife met us at Cooper Gap with a home cooked meal of ham, potatos,biscuits and sweet tea,perfect way to end the day. Thank you Mrs. Crazy Tree.
Somehow my entry for yesterday did not post. I will add it soon.","Stover Creek

Bulldog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554650,Got started on a warm sunny morning at 9:30.   There were several Army Rangers across the road setting up for their training for the day. Throughout the night I heard them driving by.My plan was to do 12 miles to the Lance Creek Campsite. I stopped for lunch at Gooch Mt. Shelter as the sky's were darkening and the temperature began falling. Soon thru hiker Tom arrived carrying his 45 lb pack.   We talked a bit and as the rain began to fall I decided to wait it out. The longer it rained the more I thought about staying for the night and making a 15 mile push tomorrow to the hostel at Neel Gap.   Marie arrived also carrying a heavy pack and noticed Tom sound asleep. She commented she had passed him several times on the trail when he was sitting with his pack on asleep and suggested his trail name should be Sleepy.,"Cooper Gap

Bulldog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554651,"Day started early, in the dark at 4am, warm but windy.   I caught up to Marie at Woody Gap, took a break then started up Big Cedar Mountain.   The day was sunny and once over Big Cedar the hiking was easy until Blood Mountain. By the time I reached the top the winds were gusting and fog rolled in.    I reached Neel Gap around 2:30 and registered for the night at the hostel. Loaded up on snacks and bought a Red Baron Pizza for dinner.    I was joined for the night by Youngblood, Tom and Marie.","Gooch Gap Shelter

Bulldog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554725,"We waited around until 9am for the outfitter store to open. Coffee and breakfast sandwich for breakfast.Having picked up my food drop the previous day, I needed to get a few items, most importantly fuel. Tom and Marie elected to get a gear shakedown (outfitter staff look at all the gear and advise what to discard or replace) to reduce their pack weight.   So far I have lucked out with rain. It began to rain shortly after my arrival yesterday, rained a little this morning, but by the time we left around 10:30 the skies were clearing. Regarding the water situation on the trail, the southeast experienced a lengthy drought last year and by November many of the springs and small streams were dry. Fortunately the recent rains have helped and all the water sources I've come across, except Woods Hole, are now running. This includes Rock Top spring at mm 34.3.I made it to Hogpen Gap around 4 and as I started up Poor Mountain it became foggy with a misty rain. For the first time I saw no other hikers on the trail today. Got to low Gap Shelter just after dark where Tom, Jibberish & Sour Patch were just finishing diner.","Neel Gap
",Low Gap Shelter,"Feb 08, Wed",11.30
Bulldog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554750,"Last night had the first freezing temp of the trip, frosting of snow on the ground and partially frozen water bottle in the morning.As I began preparing my meal last night I realized I forgot to buy a fuel canister at the outfitter. I felt really bummed for forgetting. Fortunately Jibberish was nice enough to let me use his canister to heat water for my beef stew. This oversight started me on a mental downward spiral today.The sun was shining with low 30 temp and strong winds, making for the kind of brisk conditions I like for hiking. As I walked I kept thinking about my stupidity for not buying fuel and missing my wife. I began to doubt how much I wanted this. I also kept thinking how I had hiked Georgia's ten years ago and how easy it was for me to do big miles. Now I'm hiking slower and with much more effort.I began the day planning to do about 11 miles to Tray Mountain Shelter. To get there I would have to drop down to Unicoi Gap then climb two mountains. When I reached Blue Mountain I simply decided to call it a day at 3:00.    I knew there would difficult days when I would feel like this and I vowed to hike thru them but I decided I needed a break. I called my wife to pick me up and returned home the next day.    Before even arriving home I was second guessing my decision and thinking strongly of resuming. So tomorrow, the 18th I will resume at Unicoi.","Low Gap Shelter
