Limey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519534,"Well I guess it's time to fish and stop cutting bait. Today I start my journal.I tentatively decided to through-hike the AT in June 2015, but wasn't sure if I was phsically and mentally suited to giving it a shot. Would I actually enjoy it? I started the research and planning, completed 3 shake down hikes and have decided to go for it.I plan to set off around March 25, 2016. I live in the Atlanta area so have the luxury of being able to move the dates backwards or forwards by a few days if a particularly good weather window opens up.I haven't been given a trail name, but until I am anointed with one I will go by ""Limey"". I am from England and some of my friends use that term of endearment.Limey.",,View Entry,"Jan 12, Tue",0

Approximately 2,190 miles, 14 states, gain/loss in elevation of 464,500 feet which is the equivalent of climbing Everest 16 times. I will be carrying everything that I need on my back - tent, sleeping bag, cooking equipment, food for about 4 to 6 days. Every 4 to 6 days I will leave the trail and find a town or convenience store to resupply. I will get water along the way from small creeks and treat the water with chemical drops. If successful it will take me about 6 months. There is a deadline. I have to be up at Mount Katahdin in Maine before mid-October. The park there closes around that time with the first snowfall.Here is an address for a great website that contains information about the trail:http://www.appalachiantrail.org/home/explore-the-trail

Limey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523708,"I have been strangely calm over the last 3 weeks, adopting a ""que sera""attitude. I was mentally done with the planning and my gear list and just wanted to get started. However, as my jump off day rapidly approaches I am starting to get a little anxious and nervous. My focus shifted to filing tax returns, paying bills, cancelling car insurance and numerous other administrative tasks. I have been waiting for a window of ""goodish"" weather that coincides with when my wife, Susan, will be able to drive me to Springer. I know I will face a lot of wet days on the trail, but would like to start out fairly easy and get a few days under my belt. I have got all of my major gear items and am now just fussing with the smaller items and food. The photograph shows my stove in the making. An alcohol stove made from a cat food can. it is simple and light. The main drawback is that it is difficult to simmer while cooking. The stove is either on or off. Cooking time is controlled by the amount of alcohol that you put in the can before you start.In this entry I have been experimenting with formatting. Somebody kindly posted tips on how to bold, start a new paragraph, and create lists (I've not tried the list yet, but stay tuned!).",,View Entry,"Mar 16, Wed",0
Limey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523977,"Today is the day!I woke at 5am and could not get back to sleep; too many things running through my head. The forecast for today is not good, 80% probability of rain showers throughout the day. However, as hikers before me have pointed out - ""no rain, no pain, no Maine"". It is inevitable that I will be going through rain at many points in the future. I just wanted to try and start out in a good weather window. Oh well! Sunday through Wednesday look much better; mostly sunny with a low probability of rain. However, Thursday onwards is forecast to be several days of heavy rain and thunderstorms.The last 10 days have been a blur. So many loose ends to tie up. Filing tax returns, paying bills, setting up auto pay, changing car insurance..... Basically carrying out 6 months of administration in a few days.My final pack weight is 15 pounds without food or water. One day of food weighs between 1.5 and 2 pounds. In the south I will typically be carrying 4 days of food so my fully loaded pack with food and water will be 22 to 24 pounds. My goal is to keep it under 25 pounds. This is with my winter weight clothing and sleeping quilt. If I am still going in about 6 to 8 weeks time and through the Smoky Mountains I will be able to switch to summer weight items and shave off about a pound. I decided early on in my trip planning that going light would be key for me. It makes a huge difference to my aging knees and back. My wife Susan is going to drive me to Springer, which is about a 2 hour drive away. She will hike a few of the first miles with me. Leaving her will be very difficult. I am so fortunate that Susan has supported me from the beginning in this hare brained scheme. So a big thank you to her for making it possible for me to attempt this current dream of mine, and for supporting me while I am on the trail.","Springer Mountain

I left my pack in the car and we hiked together to the summit. It was very foggy, cold and raining. Zero visibility. We posed for the obligatory photo then returned to the car to eat our lunch out of the rain. We said our goodbyes, but it was not too traumatic because Susan will meet me in about 10 days in North Carolina. We will hike together for about 4 days. As I set off walking through the woods I felt a bit like Frodo setting off an adventure and leaving Bag End behind.","Springer Mountain

I talked with a Ridge Runner there (People that work for the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and help people out). I asked how they carried in the 3 very heavy steel boxes. They used 32 US Army Rangers to hand carry in the sheets of plywood and beams for the privy, plus the 3 boxes. It took 4 Rangers for each box. They would carry it about 100 yards then stop to rest, change positions and start again.Got a late start, but made it up and over Sassafras Mountain.","Hawk Mountain campsitr

Lots of trail magic today, Trail Devil hikers with beer at Gooch Gap. Choice of PBR or Busch. Two of their camp chairs had collapsed the night before while carousing around their camp fire and they were discussing where to buy new ones. Someone suggested the thrift store, then another said ""try the DG"". It took me a while to figure out this means Dollar General. From now on I'll be calling Dollar General the ""DG"". Further up the trail Dr. Pepper and 2 lady accomplices were handing out goody bags of candy, raisins, granola.  At Woody Gap 4 amazing ladies handing out hamburgers, beanie weinies, juice, fruit. It was freezing cold with an arctic wind whistling through the Gap . They had a big fire going. Thanks to all the wonderful trail magicians.","Gooch shelter

I camped south of Jarrard and finished north of Neel Gap. Didn't see a single bear. I was looking for one with a big head for Ramsey. At Lance Creek I camped next to Friar Tuck. Went over Blood Mountain; the ascent wasn't too bad, but the descent was a little tricky. Steep and lots of rocks. Lots of hikers congregated at the Wassi Yi outfitters trading tales. I bought 4 more days of provisions and charged my phone. Great folks working there, all have successfully through hiked. Prices are a little steep, eg $2.99 for a small avocado. However, it's very convenient to be able to get what you need.","Lance Creek

I was rocking my bucket hat and bandana to cover my face and neck. I call this my ""B&B"" look. I'm sure my daughter Emma would be aghast if she saw me, but I did get several admiring stares.My campsite on top of Levelland Mountain was spectacular. I was the only one there. Great views, magnificent sun set and rise. Excellent trail magic at Tesnatee Gap. 3 wonderful Christians spreading love to all. They had chairs set up, sodas, snacks, hiker box of goodies and hand knitted beanies. The ladies from several churches make them.

A bit rocky and steep towards the end. Another gorgeous day, mid 60s, sunny with some clouds. A thunderstorm is forecast for early evening, it's been predicted for several days. It should be intense, but blow through by 2am. There's a Ridge Runner at the shelter, I chatted with him for a while. He lives in Atlanta but spends 5 days each week living on the trail moving from shelter to shelter. The season is from February to June. I may have found my next vocation.","Low Gap Shelter

Limey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525026,"Last night at Blue Mountain shelter a helicopter flew over screaming in the middle of the night. It was extremely loud, very low, just above the tree tops. It woke everyone and was the subject of conversation the next morning. Just North of Springer there is an open field close to the Trail that the Army uses for Ranger training. The helicopters drop Rangers at night onto the field and they disappear into the woods. If you ever hike the trail do not camp in that inviting looking field off to the side!. Today was my longest hike to date at 12.8 miles. I want to get into Hiawasee in time to see the England vs Germany soccer game on Saturday. I went over Rocky Mountain and Tray Mountain. The toughest summits in the Georgia section of the AT are Sassafras, Blood, Rocky and Tray mountains. I am now successfully over all of these.I have finally started to see some wildlife. I saw the snake in the photo going up Tray Mountain. I think it is a garter snake. Later that day I also saw 2 wild turkey and a pileated woodpecker. Over night at Sassafras I heard several coyotes right after dark. They were making all kinds of noise barking, howling and shrieking.","Blue Mountain shelter

Limey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525030,"The photo shows a tree with a white blaze (rectangular paint mark). This is how the trail is marked and how I find my way. It is quite easy as long as I pay attention when other trails cross the AT. Every few hundred yards there will be a white blaze to reassure me that I have not strayed. The difficult part is when I get back on the trail in the morning to remember to go in the right direction! Many people have hiked a few miles going south in the wrong direction before realizing their mistake and then have to back track. I'm sure that I will do this more than a few times before this trip is over.At Dicks Creek Gap I had my first successful hitch hike ride into town. It is 11 miles into Hiawasee. When I first arrived I stuck my thumb out as a BMW was leaving the parking area. The driver asked me which direction I was headed. He said he was heading in the opposite direction and so took off. I stood there for 5 minutes with about 6 vehicles passing without stopping. Then the same BMW came by and stopped for me. The driver (Andy from Alabama) had kindly turned around and came back to take me 11 miles out of his way (22 round trip). The kindness, friendliness and generosity of people on the trail and surrounding towns is truly amazing. Once ensconced in my hotel room I called my wife. She informed me that she has been reading other peoples' journals and I need to raise my game. Mine is not up to their level. I'm not sure what to do, apart from make them longer, but it is hard to do them quickly on my phone while trying to conserve my batteryAt the Holiday Inn hotel I recharged my phone and battery pack, did laundry, showered and watched England come from 2 nil down to beat Germany 3 to 2.","Sassafras Gap
",Dick's Creek Gap,"Mar 26, Sat",6.30
Limey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525032,"Today I decided to ""take a zero"". That's a day when a hiker takes a rest and does not hike, i.e. zero miles that day. Back to back rest days would be a double zero, or a Robert Parish (look him up in Google images if you do not know who he is). I've come 70 miles in 8 days, am feeling good, but decided to take a rest and let my body recover. It's a good hotel with indoor pool, hot tub, and walking distance of an Ingles (supermarket) and several restaurants. Most of the guests at the hotel are hikers, and the town is full of them.Now back to the topic of trail names. Most hikers adopt a trail name. Usually it is bestowed on them by fellow hikers when you display some distinguishing feature or do something embarrassing. I am going by Limey for now (which I came up with) until I am given one. Following are examples of trail names for people that I have met so far. Muffin Man he was a baker for 7 years before quitting his job to hike the trail.Romeo He misses terribly his girlfriend at home and phones her at least once every day.Radagast This young lady from Texas came to the breakfast camp fire one morning with a couple of leaves and twigs in her long, brown hair.Stop-N-Go I passed her sitting on the trail taking a smoke break. She admitted that she is more stop than go.The Beast For his prodigious ability to sweat more than any other known person. He always carries 4 liters of water and electrolyte supplements to replenish himself.The Pirate He is from Venezuela, has long, shoulder length black hair, a pointy black beard and wide brimmed hat. Looks a little like a swashbuckling buccaneer. it's about 8 miles to the North Carolina border. I need to average 12 miles per day for the next 3 days to meet Susan in Franklin . It may not sound like much, but it is a 50% increase over what I have been averaging.","Dick's Creek Gap

Limey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525698,"Today I crossed the state line into North Carolina. Stick a fork in the Georgia section of the Appalachian Trail, it is DONE. One state down, 13 more to go! It is difficult to read, but the wooden sign on the tree says ""NC/GA"". As I approached the line a group of hikers (Muffin Man, Romeo, Shaggy and a couple of others) were taking a break at the line and encouraged me up the hill to cross the line. They dubbed themselves the ""border line cheerleaders"". Mostly because their cheering was mediocre! For me personally this was my most tiring day to date. The climb straight out of Dicks Creek Gap was very steep and the Holiday Inn breakfast buffet was sitting heavily in my stomach. Also, it took me a couple of hours to adjust to coming off the zero day and getting back in the hiking groove. I crossed into North Carolina mid afternoon, fairly tired, and then had to tackle the climb up Courthouse Bald.","Dicks Creek Gap

Limey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525706,"The hiking today was much easier than yesterday. A steady climb up Standing Indian Mountain (great views check out the photos) then a gradual descent down to Carter Gap shelter. My second day in a row of around 12 miles. On track to meet up with Susan tomorrow in Franklin, North Carolina. The only disconcerting thing was the presence of bear sanctuary signs posted off to my left throughout the day. What is a bear sanctuary, and why are there no fences? I saw an interesting looking ground bird, but could not get a photo. I keep my phone powered off to conserve my battery and by the time I booted it up the bird had hidden. It was the size of a large chicken, but stocky, with a thick neck, brown and white speckled. I've looked on line, but cannot find anything quite like it. A bit like a grouse, but more upright and thicker neck plumage. If anyone knows what it might be please post an entry in my guest book.  One of the things that I have experienced while solo hiking is that I keep getting thoughts stuck in my head, rehashing conversations I have had in the past or reliving trail experiences that I want to share with my family and friends when I see them. I also get songs stuck in my head for 2 or 3 days at a time. Normally mediocre songs, certainly not my favorites. For example, Ashes to Ashes by David Bowie was lodged in my head for 3 straight days. It's an OK record, but certainly would not be in my top 500 play list. I can't remember the last time that I heard it played. Where did it come from? The only thing that will displace it is another obscure song that I'm not particularly fond of. So today I decided to proactively take command of my mind space by singing a song that I am more fond of. I belted out a fine rendition of Space oddity, replete with all special effects and instrumental over lays. I only know about 30% of the lyrics, but I did not let that slow me down. A shame that nobody was around to hear it (I think). ""...tell my wife I love her very much, she knows.....""","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Limey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525707,"This morning I came out of Carter Gap to climb up Albert Mountain. There was a very steep climb with a fire tower at the top. I was listening to music in shuffle mode on my phone and it was quite a coincidence that two songs played right as I was finishing the summit. One was ""A Thousand Trees"" by the Stereophonics, followed by ""All Along the Watchtower"". ""There must be some way out of here, said the joker to the thief...""  The tower is 100 miles from Springer, so a big milestone was achieved today. I felt elated for about 5 seconds before another hiker pointed out that we still have 2,100 miles to go. So just repeat this feat another 21 times.  Several hikers were at the top having lunch when I arrived. I started chatting with Hobbler and we set off hiking together after lunch. We did the six miles down to Rock Gap in 2 hours 25 minutes, which is quite a fast pace for me. I enjoyed talking while hiking. Hobbler was in the Coast Guard for 22 years, has now retired, lives in the Philippines and globe trots.Hobbler and I were waiting at Rock Gap for the Macon County shuttle when Ron Havens showed up in the Budget Inn shuttle. He kindly offered us a free ride into town which we eagerly accepted. However, halfway into town the van got a flat tire and we had to wait for Ron's wife to come rescue us. At this point Hobbler confessed that this was the third shuttle bus he has been on this trip that has broken down with him on board. He is considering changing his trail name to Shuttle-Slayer. I am considering never riding a shuttle with Hobbler again...I checked into the Comfort Inn and Susan was about an hour away.

He wanted to hike with Susan and I, and spend a night on the trail. He couldn't have picked a more challenging night, the forecast was 50 to 80 mph winds with gusts over 100 and temperature dropping to 30 degrees. He is thinking about thru hiking next year. I hope this experience does not deter him.There was trail magic at Wayah Bald. The views from the stone tower were exceptional. The weather at night was as forecast. The wind was howling. It would start as a low rumble in the distance, like a plane taking off, and build to a loud crescendo. As it passed overhead the noise was intense. The tree tops would sway and shake, the tent was buffeted. At the same time the temperature dropped to to 30 degrees. It was as cold as my second day on the trail when it snowed. I stayed mostly warm, however occasionally my feet and hands would be cold and it would take time to warm up. It helped having 2 people in the tent.

Limey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526713,"This was my toughest day yet. The longest miles at 15.8, but also hard miles. The climb out of the NOC is 6 miles straight up hill, followed by Cheoah Bald.   Its then a hard downhill to Stecoah Gap.  I had my music playing to help me power up hill. I have to thank the boys for pulling me up : the Stones, Floyd, Pearl Jam, early Genesis, Clapton, Nirvana, Oasis. The anthemic rock songs clearly are good to hike to. However, a couple of artists surprised me. Johnny Cash songs generally have a nice jaunty beat and simple lyrics that it is hard even for me to butcher too badly. The only downside is that his songs are generally of short duration. Radiohead was also a surprise. Their beat is more subtle, but the songs are calming and relaxing, particularly if I am fortunate to hit them on a level or gentle downhill stretch.  One of my goals for the trip is to get in touch with my inner self and ponder deep questions. A couple came up today. Who is Quinn the Eskimo? Why do people jump for joy when he shows up? When I reached Stecoah Gap at about 6.30 I called a B&B that has a shuttle service. However, the lady was just leaving to go in the opposite direction to pick up hikers and could not come and get me. I could have tried to hitch hike into town, but I figured it was only 2.4 miles to push on the trail to Brown Fork Gap shelter. Can't be that bad, right? Wrong! It was a tough hike up ""Jacob's Ladder"".   A very steep section that felt like a 45 degree angle. At times I was almost on all fours crawling. If I had been fresh it would not have been too bad, however it was at the end of a long day and I was out of gas. I pulled into the shelter at about 7.45 as light was fast fading.

Limey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526718,"Part of the reason that I pushed so hard yesterday was to get into Fontana Dam before some bad weather hits. Wednesday night is forecast to have thunderstorms, Thursday and Friday wet, temperature dropping, snow and sub-zero temperatures coming in the Smokies. The hike today was easier than yesterday, but my body was feeling the effects, particularly my knees on the downhills.  I listened to some podcasts (Premier League Football Weekly with Jimbo and a BBC news comedy show). I'm now caught up on the race at the top and the relegation dog fight. It seems it will be difficult for anyone to catch Leicester unless they implode. (Like Liverpool a couple of seasons back). My previous (and only) backpacking trip was my shake down hike last September. I hiked from Amicalola Falls to Unicoi Gap, which is about 60 miles. I have now hiked 165 miles which is my new personal record. Thinking about Maine is too far away, so I set myself shorter term goals. My current goals are to make it through the Smokey Mountains (they start here and go for about 80 miles), to make it over Clingman's Dome (the highest point on the whole AT and mid way through the Smokies) and to surpass 200 miles.I got into Fontana Dam at about 5.30. I was waiting at the marina for the shuttle bus. As the van pulled up someone from inside called out ""no Brits allowed on this bus!"". It was Southpaw, Iwocs and Ken. They had been up to the lodge and found that no rooms were available. I had reserved a room earlier in the day and offered to share my room with them. It was cosy with 4 of us.

Limey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527387,"Walking across the top of Fontana Dam was very scenic. (see photos that I have posted). The sky was clear and visibility was excellent. The trail goes right past the ""Fontana Hilton"". According to other hiker's journals this is the most luxurious shelter on the Trail. It has 4 platforms for sleeping, a hot shower, charging station that is solr powered, hand pump for pouring water and a great view of the lake. Cases of Norovirus are now rampant. This virus causes vomitting, diarrhea and saps your strength. It is highly contagious and spread by people in close proximity to each other. The first instances were reported at the NOC and spread North. At least 2 hikers were at the Fontana Lodge for a couple of days waiting for the bug to pass through.The forecast for the next 3 nights was below freezing, in the 20's (Fahrenheit), but no rain so I decided to push on.After walking across the dam you walk up a short hill and then enter the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP). In advance you need to pay a $20 fee and print out a permit. As you enter the park you deposit half of the permit into a box. The box was over flowing and I had difficulty stuffing in my permit. That showed the volume of hikers that are in front of me. In the GSMNP you must use the shelters unlesss all of the shelter spots are taken. Camping is discouraged. If you are a thru hiker and have a shelter spot, but then if a section hiker with a reservation shows up you must give up your spot and go pitch a tent even if it is cold, dark and raining. I prefer camping and have not yet stayed at a shelter. The climb out of Fontana Dam was steep and strenuous. On the way up I passed Shuckstack fire tower. The wind was blowing very hard, gusting even higher and was icey cold. I decided to climb up the tower and eat my lunch. I thought there would be a great scenic view from the top. This was a HUGE mistake. The old steel structure was rickety, for the first 4 flights of stairs there was only one handrail on the stairs and at the landings where you turn 180 degrees there was no hand rail. (see photos that I have posted). The wind was howling and the gusts threatened to blow me off the stairs. About half way up I thought about going back down, but did not want to turn around. So I continued upwards with one hand clutching a railing and in one hand my packed lunch. You climb up into the tower through the floor. I finally made it and sat on the floor. I used to work on large construction projects and have a pretty good head for heights, however this had me shaking in my boots. This was the 4th firetower that I have climbed this trip and this is the only one where I had bad vertigo. The tower was run down and was about 6 feet by 6 feet including the whole in the floor for exiting. There were steel panels around the bottom and glass windows from waist height up. One of the steel panels was loose and flapping and banging in the wind. Several glass panes were broken or loose and clattering. I sat on the floor eating my lunch wondering how I would get down. If I lifted my head up above the steel panels the wind was howling and gusting so I stayed hunkered down on the floor. This was the most scared that I have been on the trip so far.I camped at Mollies Ridge Shelter because all of the Shelter spots were taken. It snowed in the night and was very cold. I awoke to a snow covered tent, zero visibility and fog all around. While eating breakfast at the shelter one of the hikers commented that entering the GSMNP was like crossing the Great Wall.

The trail up to the dome was snowy, icey and very slippery. At a tricky point I lost my balance, took a tumble off the trail and fell about 6 to 8 feet into a tree. The fall was long enough that I had time to think while I was in the air ""this is it, my hike is over, I'm going to break something"". I landed heavily against a tree. I slowly took stock of my situation from a snow pile. My legs looked good and not broken, my arms and head felt ok. But then I looked at my right hand. 3 of my fingers were splayed in different directions. Each one pointing in a totally different direction and each one at 90 degrees to the knuckle. My hand looked horrifically deformed. Curiously enough it did not hurt too badly beacuase of the cold. My hand was numb. Fortunately I was hiking with Chicken Feet who was behind me. He found me off the trail and helped me to climb back up. He pulled hard on each of my fingers to pop them into place. The middle finger went at first attempt. However the ring finger and pinky each took several pulls. When flexed my fingers to test them out, the pinky popped out and had to be reset. By this point the cold was wearing off and my hand was starting to hurt. I started to feel light headed and nauseous so sat back on a snow bank. Cheicken Feet pronounced that he had some Mink Oil. His English is heavily accented and I had no idea what he was referring to. As I was sucking down lungfuls of air to try and clear my head and avoid fainting Chicken Feet produced a small unmarked glass vial. Before I could ask what this was and before I could stop him he was spreading it under my nose and around my nostrils. As a burst of vapor went up my nose and my eyes bagan to water I realised that it was mint oil. It actually worked well and helped to clear my head. Chicken Feet was great and really took care of me. I owe him a big debt of gratitude. We slowly set off hiking, my right hand gripped about my hiking pole to prevent the fingers from dislocating agai. I hiked very carefully at a slow pace since I was fearful that if I fell again I could seriously damage my right hand. We made it up over Clingmans Dome. Later that afternoon (about 3 hours after my fall) I called back to Chicken Feet ""Hey Chicken Feet, you seemed to know what you were doing back there. Have you re-set fingers before?"". To which he replied with a laugh ""NO, you the first one. But I did watch a Youtube video once!"".

It continued to rain throughout the day until late afternoon. Chicken Feet'so energy level was low and he did not want to go far, so we just went 4.9 miles. I stayed with him in case he was coming down with something and might need help. The shelter was the most crowded yet. Some hikers decided to take a zero rest day at the shelter (which is against park rules) which caused congestion with the slew of people coming up behind. The park discourages camping and requires that you use the shelters. The problem is that in peak season there are too many hikers and not enough shelters. We had 24 sleeping in a shelter designated for only 12. 21 slept on the 2 platforms, 2 on the floor and 1 hammock. It was real cozy. There were an additional 15 to 20 tents or hammocks outside.

Limey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528199,"Took a zero day in Asheville with my wife, Susan. We went to the botanical gardens and identified some of the flowers, bushes and trees that I have seen on the Trail. We walked down side trails to a creek and climbed rocks. I was paranoid about not slipping and falling. How embarassing would it be to suffer a hike ending injury while zeroing in a botanical garden? My new found hiker BFF's would certainly give me a tough time. This was followed by visits to a couple of small breweries and then a great dinner. While I have access to a computer and wifi I will take this downtime opportunity to catch you up on a couple of thoughts from the trail.  First, my rain pants episode.Most days I like to hike in shorts. However, in the 3 very cold days in the Smoky Mountains I wore my rain pants for extra warmth. These are the only long trousers that I have with me. I started hiking and my slick nylon rain pants kept slipping down. I felt like a rap singer walking along, hoiking up my pants as I went with my underwear presumably showing at the back. I took a break, took off my back pack, pulled up my rain pants as far as they would go and then tightened up my backpack hip belt over the rain pants to hold them in place. Convinced that I had fixed the problem once and for all I set off again. Within 20 yards it felt like my pants had slipped low again. I continued walking, legs akimbo, continually pulling up my pants. My range of motion was limited. Going downhill was not too bad, but taking large steps uphill was severely restricted. The weather was too cold to keep stopping, taking off my cloves and messing with it, so I kept going. When I got to camp I finally discovered the true problem. I had not tied the drawstring on my hiking shorts that were under my rain pants. The shorts had fallen down inside the rain pants and bunched up in my crotch region! It was the shorts that were limiting my walking motion. Another valuable hiking lesson learned. ALWAYS TIE YOUR DRAWSTRING. Hopefully it will remain warm enough for me to hike in shorts.Second, thoughts on trail laws.Hikers learn from each other and from scouring internet sites. Following are a few tips that I have labelled as trail Laws. 1. When resupplying and buying food, South Paw (a 2008 thru hiker that is doing it again this year) recommends only buying food that has at least 130 calories per ounce. This screens for food that has a high calory density and will provide the energy that you need to burn. This will lead you to foods with a lot of carbs, sugar and fat. However, a word of warning. If you follow this rule you will almost certainly not be adhering to the food pyramid, you will probably also contract scurvy and have your hair and teeth fall out. However, you will have the energy that you need. It is also difficult to get the fat that you need on the trail. I thought I was doing well by buying and drinking pints of whole milk (I've been drinking only skim milk for as long as I can remember) until I heard that at his first resupply stop South Paw bought a 16 oz carton of half and half and downed it on the spot!2. A pound of weight on your feet is equivalent to 5 pounds on your back. This is an adage that encourages hikers to buy lighter trail running shoes rather than heavy leather hiking boots.3. (I came up with this one myself) The length of time that a song remains stuck in your head is directly proportional to its banality and repetitiveness. I can't believe that Newton missed this one when he was pulling his laws together (unless maybe it doesn't apply to classical music).","Asheville

I don't ever feel really hungry, but am eating whatever I feel like. Also, I am eating whole milk vs skim.

It may be the most challenging section on the trail so far. Stayed at the Hiker Friendly Hostel. Organized Sherpas and checked oxygen tanks.  On the way in met Southpaw, 60 cents and Down Under.  Finally met Ms. Janet in her van. She starts in the spring in Springer and travels north keeping pace with the hikers. Up until now I've just missed her several times. I discovered that advice that I was given way back and attributed to her was not correct. Since Tennessee I have not been hanging a bear line. I was told that Ms. Janey agreed with that practice. Well, in New Hampshire she personally recommends always hanging a bear line!","Ore Hill campsite

Moosilauke ascent with fresh legs and when it was cooler. Today's photo shows the profile. 4,000 feet straight up in about 3 miles. The climb was not as difficult as I expected, but the descent was far harder. The descent was very steep, slippery rock face and boulders. Several hikers thought that it was the hardest descent so far on the trail. At the summit it was socked in, clouds and very windy. A couple jf times wind gusts blew me sideways off the path and I struggled to keep my feet. A backpack really increases the impact of the wind. Apparently on a clear day it is possible to see Canada. I struggled to see my own feet.  At night a huge rain storm hit. It had been forecast days previously. I stayed mostly dry, with just a little condensation accumulatING inside my tent.","Hiker Friendly hostel

The heavy rain during the night made the trail very wet, muddy and slippery. Despite the rain I slept for 10.5 hours. I was beat. Again it was socked in with clouds on the summits. No views, zero visibility.  My pace was very slow due to the technically difficult terrain and the conditions. I had to get to the trail head since Right Lanes brother had booked me into a motel. At 3pm I asked a Sobo , local day hiker what the trail was like up ahead for me. He asked me where I was headed, then looked at his watch, laughed and said ""good luck"". That didn't help my spiruts. I finally got to the trail head at almost 9pm. The last hour was hiked in total darkness (with my flashlight ). Right Lane and his twin brother were waiting for me in a car. We stopped for beer and pizza and all was right in the world.  Lesson learned : I need to dial back my mileage estimates in the Whites.

You get to sleep on the dining room floor and eat leftovers for dinner and lunch. In return the hiker does minimal work such as cleaning a few dishes or sweeping the bunk room floor. I was very fortunate to get a spot at 6pm. Normally you have to be at the hut around 3 or 4pm to get one of the spots. Dinner was pumpkin bisque, black bean enchildas, broccoli, salad, pound cake.

Limey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547524,"Started the day with a fairly easy hike up to the summit of Mt Washington. Visibility was mixed, with gaps in the clouds providing occasionaL long distance views. Saw the steam engine cog railway.  There is a concession restaurant at the summit that sells pizza, hot dogs, chili, etc... After partaking in some junk calories another hiker invited me over for some trail magic. Her parents had set up in a corner with all kinds of goodies, including a pannini sandwich press! Lots of great fruit, cheese, crackers, dips, Clif bars. Everyone was encouraged to eat as much as they could and to take with them whatever they wanted. Such kind and great people.  The hike down was more difficult than it looked in the trail guide, plus I had been delayed by the trail magic. The trail was very rocky and slow going. I had originally planned to go about 10 miles to a campsite, but only made it to the Madison hut. I arrived at 6pm. Frickles was outside and had just been turned down for work for stay. I decided to give it a shot anyway since it was a difficult 3 miles over the summit of Madison to the campsite. I was accepted for work for stay. I have no idea what the decision criteria are. They had 5 slots and I was the second accepted. By 7pm all slots were filled. There was a thunderstorm approaching and the winds were picking up. Thru hikers that turned up after 7pm were turned away even though it was dark, raining, and a storm was approaching. The dining area could easily hold 14 or 16 hikers. I don't blame the croo chief for doing his job, I see both sides of the issue. The people paying $150 per night for a bunk don't want their common area overtaken by smelly, free loading thru hikers. However, it was a very inhospitable night to be turning people away. There aren't enough shelters (versus huts) or campsites in the Whites. They are too far apart.","Lake of the Clouds hut

Limey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547526,"Today was by far the scariest day on the trail so far. All through the night I could hear the wind howling outside the Hut and it woke me up frequently. In the morning it was still very windy and cloudy, visibility was only 20 to 50 feet. Commando and Shades came in for breakfast, they had stealth camped outside the Hut and said it was their worst night ever. Shades spent the night spreadeagled with her arms and legs out trying to hold her tent down and to stop it from blowing away. Commando said that his tent poles were now bent from the pressure of the Wind. In the morning the wind was still high and visibility was low. However a couple of younger hikers, Eagle and Optimist, decided to go over Mount Madison. I decided to follow them. It was the scariest part of my trip so far. The trail was an exposed ridge that went up over Mt Madison with steep drop offs on both sides. The wind was a steady 50 to 70 mph, gusting to 85mph. Twice I was blown over, off my feet. Fortunately I tried to hike on the windward edge of the trail so was blown over onto the trail, but not over the edge. Frequently I crouched in the shelter of a large rock or cairn to wait for the wind to subside. I would then scramble to the shelter of the next rock pile. I spent much of my time on all fours, like Gollum (except never going down head first!). I found out the next day that Mt Madison and Washington had both been closed from about noon onwards. I must have been one of the last ones over Madison. Mt Washington was evacuated and all hikers had to take a shuttle down. A day that I will remember for some time.  Over night the conditions changed from some of the most pleasant, perfect hiking conditions to the most dangerous.","Madison Spring hut.

As long as I stay moving I stay warm. Parts of the trail were steep rock faces with minimal hand and foot holds. The rain made it more challenging.  I broke my Personal speed Record for getting a hitch hike ride into town. My previous best was in Manchester Center where there was a truck waiting at the parking area. Today a man out running with his dog passed me on the trail before I got to the road and asked me whether I would like a ride into town.

The bottom of the valley is filled with large boulders and slabs of rock that have fallen in there. You have to navigate around, under and over these large rocks. It took me 2 hours to go one mile. About 5 times Pitch It and I had to take off our packs and either pass them over rocks or through narrow gaps. It was more like rock climbing than hiking.  The notch is immediately followed by Mahoosuc Arm. This is a steep uphill stretch that is a smooth slab of rock. Very few hand or foot holds. Frequently the rock is streaming wet from water seeping out of the ground. Quite dangerous.  Following the Arm I decided to push on a little further since my daily mileage was still low.
