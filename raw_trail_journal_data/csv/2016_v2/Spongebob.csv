I've got about 90% of gear bought (ultra light: tarp/quilt/bivvy setup; hoping that will keep me warm enough next march). Really enjoyed mike clelland's book on UL backpacking! I trust he knows what he's talking about. Planning on doing a ""knee test"" next month (100 mi in 10 days) to avoid possible embarrassment next year. I'll just have to get in shape as I go, I'm afraid (not enough time to do it beforehand!)

DONE! I'm very happy because it appears that my knees can ""take it"" and will not be a limiting factor in my thru-hike (assuming I don't do something stupid). However, I think I found my new ""weakest link""- MY SKIN!! I have rashes all over (worst on my back where the shoulder straps are, and where the padded backpack touches my back, but also on arms, legs (can still see striped rash where my socks were), and upper chest. The rash on my back is quite thick and palpable. I've been wearing synthetic shirts, but no rash below my waistline (where there were 2 layers), so I'm thinking maybe I need to wear 2 shirts?? (this was very warm humid weather). I'm assuming the rashes are due to rubbing. Do you experienced backpackers have any advice or answer for me on this? I'd appreciate it! And all these rashes despite daily showering, and even air conditioning while hiking with an only 20 lb pack. I'd hate to see what it would look like if I had no showers or AC (ie.on the A.T.)!
I probably won't post much now until I see you on the trail! I can hardly wait!

Happy to report that I AM able to sleep fairly well (and be plenty warm enough) with my current tarp/bivy/pad/quilt combination in cold weather. Temperature dropped into the mid twenties, and it was no problem. Of course, there was very little wind, and no precipitation, so I can still worry about those conditions, but overall, a successful gear test I think. We slept at just over 11,000 feet altitude, then hiked up to almost 14,000 the next day. AWESOME mountain, although I can tell you that by the end of the day,after picking our way along the trail through hundreds of lava fields for about 13 miles at that altitude, I had had ENOUGH!!

Now if it was dusk outside, Inside it was dark. Too dark in the woods for a bird By sleight of wing To better its perch for the night, Though it still could sing. The last of the light of the sun That had died in the west Still lived for one song more In a thrush's breast. Far in the pillared dark Thrush music went -- Almost like a call to come in To the dark and lament. But no, I was out for stars; I would not come in. I meant not even if asked; And I hadn't been.by Robert Frost","

Got a bit ""turned around"" at top of Pleasant Pond Mountain, and, uncertain which side of the mtn I was on, and determined not to go far the wrong way, I sat down and had a big breakfast and tried (unsuccessfully) to download the Guthook app for this section of trail (couldn't get good enough reception). Soon, along came my new trail-buddies Blue Sky and Redwing (from behind, so I was going the right way), and I was hiking again. Met Sobo section-hiker/ex through-hiker Felix, whom I remember talking to, with Mr Bean, at the restaurant in the Nantahala Outdoor Center in NC in March. Slept in lean-to with section-hiking couple Kanga and Bellygoat. During the night heard a lone coyote howling (loud), and lots of loons. The large lake (""pond"") was (again, like at Pierce Pond Lean-to) right in front of our lean-to, with gorgeous sunset views.2-Moxie Bald to Monson. Saw a beautiful merlin (small falcon) today and yesterday. Got wet up to knees (first time) crossing the Piscataquis River. Ate at BBQ place with Blue Sky and Redwing, then went to Shaws for shower, bunk, etc.When I see birches bend to left and right Across the lines of straighter darker trees, I like to think some boy's been swinging them. But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay As ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning After a rain. They click upon themselves As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel. Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust— Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen. They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load, And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed So low for long, they never right themselves: You may see their trunks arching in the woods Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair Before them over their heads to dry in the sun. But I was going to say when Truth broke in With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm I should prefer to have some boy bend them As he went out and in to fetch the cows— Some boy too far from town to learn baseball, Whose only play was what he found himself, Summer or winter, and could play alone. One by one he subdued his father's trees By riding them down over and over again Until he took the stiffness out of them, And not one but hung limp, not one was left For him to conquer. He learned all there was To learn about not launching out too soon And so not carrying the tree away Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise To the top branches, climbing carefully With the same pains you use to fill a cup Up to the brim, and even above the brim. Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish, Kicking his way down through the air to the ground. So was I once myself a swinger of birches. And so I dream of going back to be. It's when I'm weary of considerations, And life is too much like a pathless wood Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs Broken across it, and one eye is weeping From a twig's having lashed across it open. I'd like to get away from earth awhile And then come back to it and begin over. May no fate willfully misunderstand me And half grant what I wish and snatch me away Not to return. Earth's the right place for love: I don't know where it's likely to go better. I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree, And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more, But dipped its top and set me down again. That would be good both going and coming back. One could do worse than be a swinger of birches. (Birches, by Robert Frost)","

(and some concluding thoughts)Black Bear and I set out unsuspectingly, at 7 am in calm but foggy weather, up the slopes of Mt Katahdin. The middle third of the ascent (the rock scramble) the wind started to pick up, but we were still dry and unsuspecting. We got up on the table-lands, and after about half a mile across this, it started raining hard, the wind picked up dramatically, and we heard several peals of thunder. Then the rain turned to sleet, and it was hard to walk because of the heavy winds! (est 60mph, and I'm not exaggerating). We were soaked to the bone and getting very cold. Being unable to quickly remove ourselves from danger (and being so close to the summit) we decided to keep going as quickly as possible. Black Bear very kindly took some video of me staggering up to the sign at the top, a couple of quick shots of us in front of the sign, and then we fled back down the trail. After a seeming eternity, we were down over the wet rock scramble and in the safety of the trees. There was no one to slap on the back (or fist-bump, the hiker equivalent), so we left, and had some hot coffee and snacks at the AT Cafe in Millinocket, I signed the ceiling tile, and we were off to Black Bear's in Bangor!
