dahogman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522975,"I am going to an AT seminar tonight. Perhaps that will me over the edge to do this thing. Due to events recently I have gone from 50-50 to about 65-35 going. Isn't that just like a scientist: always using the statistics. I have not purchased my gear yet even at this late date because of my indecisiveness. But I have a pretty good idea of what I will be purchasing if I do go. Anyway, I'm going to Jacksonville, FL this weekend to run a race. So I probably won't post until next week what I'm doing.","Amicalola Falls

dahogman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523270,"Things are finally starting to come together. I bought my pack, tent, sleeping bag with liner, and a titanium pot and spork (which is all I will use. My stoves (alcohol and wood) are both homemade and weigh together 2.5 oz. The pack is a year old Granite Gear Crown 60 as in 60 liters. I took out the back support in it which saved me 5.5 oz of weight. There will be a few straps that I cannot see the purpose of. They will be coming off as I head down the trail. But for now they are staying on until I know for sure I will never be using them. The tent is a Big Agnes Flycreek 1. It fits nicely where the platypus water bag in the pack would go...another item that won't be used. The bag is a Marmot Atom good for 40 degrees which with a liner should be plenty good for what I'm doing. No artic treks here. The pad will be an REI Flash. I tried it at the store. Very comfy. Still a lot left to do. Bills to pay and utilities to take care of. Stop my mail or have someone pick it up. And get my nephew onboard to take care of some mail drops. If you're reading this, Chad, you need to give me a call.","AT

dahogman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523416,"I am so happy with myself. Just like a kid. Made my own wood burning stove and I did not see another one like it on the internet...my own invention. Now it does have the same principles as a bunch of the other stoves but I made mine from a flour shifter. Yup. I was looking around for a IKEA utensil holder with all the holes. It's the big homemade wood burning stove base these days. I couldn't find one but while I was looking I picked up this flour shifter and said....HHMMMM. If you're not familiar with one, it has the spring handle with three screens with ""gears"" between each driven by the spring handle. It was only $5. SO I bought it. I took off the handle, removed the top 2 screens from their rungs in the cylinder. They popped out without too much effort. I then drilled holes around the bottom right above the bottom screen. Next I cut my door out of the side, filed down the sides to smooth it down and replaced the second screen back to the rung where the third had originally sat. This allowed a gap about a finger's digit wide where you could put your fire starting material. I will probably be using lint from a dryer coated with Vaseline. The third screen I placed about 1/2 inch from the top on a rung of holes I drilled. It sits nicely on top of the metal that was pushed inside as I drilled. I can put my pot/bowl on top of that while I cook. The wood will be put in the door on top of the replaced second screen and can be renewed without have to remove the cooking utensil. With all the screens back in, the vessel is very sturdy. I'm going to fire it up tomorrow and see how it works. 
Drawbacks: It is a bit bulky. I could pop out the top screen and fill the container/stove up with minutia to save space, but I'm not certain I want to keep messing with that screen. It could frazzle on me. I will still probably put some minutia into it while I hike but it will have to be really small stuff. Also it weighs close to 6oz. That's a little more than I was wanting it to weigh. My alcohol stove only weighs 1.5 oz. They will both be coming along.","

dahogman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523585,I went out yesterday and tried out the wood burning stove. The lint coated in Vaseline (as best you can coat a lump of lint) really burnt well and for a long enough period to get some damp twigs lit. It fit perfectly in the slot for fire starter but almost immediately I saw the door/opening for the wood was too small. I could not build as big a fire as I wanted. That being said I got a boil going within a reasonable amount of time but certainly not as quick as I would like.   Plus the ventilation could have been better.So I enlarged the door last night and will put some more holes in the side at the level of the wood/fire and see how that works. Probably try it this afternoon after I get a short haircut. Mailed 4 pair of tennis shoes to Chad. He will need to keep abreast of my journals to be prepared to mail me some more shoes when the ones I'm wearing finally wear thin or rip. I turned off the electricity and TV/internet April 1. So I guess I better be on the trail by then. OMG!,"AT

dahogman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523617,Tried the wood burning stove after the alterations and it worked great. Got a nice fire this time starting with dry leaves crammed into the starting slot. Fired right up. That's exciting because I can save my coated lint for the times when things are wet. Plus I will be picking up and saving leaves and twigs along the way when things are dry. So I shouldn't have to take an over-abundance of lint or even alcohol for the other stove. Anyway got a rolling boil between 5 and 6 minutes. Had a good bed of coals in the stove even after the fire went out which would have been sufficient to cook on for another 3-5 minutes. The best part is that the most efficient flame was produced by the smallest twigs. Those things are everywhere. You don't even notice them. They are that abundant. I'll have plenty of fuel. Chad I mailed the tennis shoes today. So look out for them.,"appalachian trail

dahogman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523948,I found my rain pants. 25-30 years ago my father and I went to a Northside highschool football playoff game (both of ours alma mater). It was gonna' rain cats and dogs so we went out and bought two rain suits. Now these are not high tech by any stretch of the imagination: lots of real time rubber with no zippers or pockets. Ultra-light they are not either. But they are FREE. The pants weigh right around a lb. whereas a pair of Marmot rain pants weight in at around 9 oz. So I gain 7oz. But they are FREE. They are warm also 'cause this definitely ain't no breathing material. But that's OK 'cause they are FREE. I'm taking 'em and I'm not looking back. I'll ditch my old metal potholder that I was contemplating taking with me. That was over 6 oz. It was more of a want than a need anyway. Plus I won't take my Bowie knife either or my AK-15 and 38 revolver. That'll also save some weight. I'll be fine unless a Red Dawn scenario takes place.,"

dahogman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524228,"Finally got everything I need. Threw it in the pack just to see what it looked and felt like. It was FULL. I could barely wrap the excess trash compacter top to seal the top against rain. I thought it was too heavy but when I went and weighed it, the pack weighed in at 25 lbs. Not bad but I feel it could be lighter. That's about the weight of 2 bowling balls. I do have about a weeks worth of food in the pack. I won't be carrying that much with me normally. It appears there will be plenty of places to resupply until the 100 mile wilderness. So I will go back in and see what I can cull out. Still have not found the complete link up to get me to the AT. This is really turning into a gigantic pain in the butt. Where is Scotty when you need him. Beam me up, damn it. Well I'm sure this won't be the only frustration I have on this trip. Hmmm...I guess this is why it pays to have friends.","Appalachian Trail

dahogman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524359,"Finally got a ride. I'll be arriving at Amicalola Falls Easter Sunday. I reserved a room in the lodge for one last night of decadence and will head out bright and early Monday morning. I'm going to shoot for Hawk Mountain Shelter which would be a 16.9 mile hike. Going for the shin slpints and blown tendons right away. Next day a 23 mile hike would put me in Neel Gap where supposedly there would be lodging. I'm not going to lie to ya'; if there is a hotel or hostel within eyesight of the trail, I'm there. I'm just thru hiking. I ain't doing no Naked and Afraid nonsense here. Still go t some arranging in the pack to do. Got way too much food...way too many moonpies anyway. I'll do something about that problem this week. Been working on that particular problem already today....yummy.","AT

dahogman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524487,"This will be last entry before I hit the trail. Loaded everything in my pack...everything. I used 2 trash compacter bags instead of trying to squeeze it into one like I did last time. Works much better and am very confident now as far as being water-proof. Still weighs in at 26-27 lbs. I'll accept that. The weight will be going down as I eat the food. I feel as ready as I can be. I'm going to make a few more lint balls. I'm fairly obsessed with being able to make a fire every night. Other than that I just need my rain jacket to show up in the mail. Supposed be here the 24th. Be glad when it gets here so I can finally just focus on stupid movies and ancient aliens till I leave. I vacillate between thinking this is not worth it to being very excited. Guess I won't know my true feelings till I get on the trail. Next entry will probably be Neel Gap in Georgia before the end of the month or possibly Wesser, NC which would be 2 weeks away.

dahogman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524860,"I know, I know. I was not going to do this again till the trail but I took the loaded pack for a trial run. I did 3.4 miles on a gravel rough road with some hills. Of course it's not going to compare to the trail but it was better than nothing. I finished it in an hour and 5 minutes which equates to 3.1 MPH which equates to 25 miles in 8 hours. Now that is not going to happen in reality. However, if I can even do 2.5 MPH on decent terrain that will mean 20 miles a day and on bad terrain 12-15 miles a day. The pack was not a problem. Felt pretty comfortable and rode well. Everything inside seems to survive the jostling. I'm ready. I think while I'm hiking, I'll be fine. It's the nights where I think I might have some problems, especially if I'm out there all by my lonesome. That being said, with 3500 starters thru hiking, I doubt I'll be alone at the shelters for a while. By the time that happens, I'll probably have already killed a bear and will be able to turn the night-lite off.","AT

dahogman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525028,"Well after a harrowing ride, I'm here at Amicalola Falls State Park Lodge. The guy who brought me over races cars as a hobby and I felt like I was in a freakin' race car the whole way over. It was good to step out of the car and on firm ground...intact! Once in the park, the ride to the lodge was straight uphill and uphill and uphill. My god! If the entire hike is like that I'm in big trouble. That was fairly depressing. Goodby 15-20 miles a day. Hello 10 miles a day. Anyway I got here way early. Checkin time is 4PM and it's only noon. Luckily I actually brought a book. Hopefully I can finish it tonight so I can jettison it. My pack was closer to 30 lb. this morning than it was 25. Waaay too much food and some other stuff that I'm sure I will unload as the hike goes along. But I would rather start off with too much than not enough. I can always mail the excess to Chad or just toss it in the trash. I wish I was more excited. But truthfully I'm not. Hopefully it's just the 5,000,000 footsteps ahead me, crapping on the trail, rainy days, no hot showers and not some real reason to be down. Maybe I'm just feeling lonely.Right now, I got to look around and make sure I have the right trail to link up to the AT.
Addendum: got checked in, ate a bit, and went to hike over to the falls. Miserable day...drizzly and cool. I wore 3 layers and got too warm. So I feel fairly confident in my trail apparel. Also got invigorated by the hike. So am in much better spirits. 
It's so weird: I feel like I've moved to a different country and am starting a new career...a career that is out of my comfort zone. But I'll get over that soon enough...starting tomorrow.","appalachian trail

dahogman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526304,"Hello everyone. I am alive and well...sorta. Kidding. Things are getting better. But let me start at the beginning. Started From Amicalola Falls, of course, and wanted to make it to Hawk Mt. shelter. Did so but it was a 17 mile hike right off the bat and I buggered up my left heel in doing so. I think I bruised it but I'm still not sure. Your feet hurt so much on a daily basis that you can't pinpoint anything for certain. So the next day out of fear, I only 8 miles to Gooch Mt. shelter and took the majority of the afternoon off to let my heel recover. It felt much better the next day which was fortunate because I needed to get to Neel Gap where there was lodging. I knew when I left that it was going to storm on Wednesday. So I wanted shelter. So that was a 16 mile hike which went over Blood Mt at the 13 mile mark. Blood Mt is a 4500' foot-chewing monster with spectacular views.Anyway I made Neel Gap. I had left early that morning so that I could get there early enough to get a room/cabin. I was very nervous about finding one since everyone else had the same idea. I got the last cabin available, Otherwise I would have spending the night in a ""room"" with about 13 other guys. Uh, no thanks. I gotta' say when I arrived at Neel Gap, had there been an AT shuttle sitting in the parking lot, I would be home right now. My feet hurt. I was in terrible spirits. I certainly was not having fun, The shelters were crowded and noisy. The trails were full of people. It just seemed crowded. And mentally, even though I knew this was going to be tough, I was not prepared for what I was enduring. Plus I felt a bit powerless in being able to make reservations ahead of time and having to depend on happenstance for rides anywhere. So I spent a down day at the cabin and did some serious soul searching as to whether to continue or not. Plus if I was going to continue, I was going to have to change my mind-set. So now instead of trying to reach MT. K. as my goal. I decided to make it a day by day thing. Plus I also decided if there was a town in the same zip code as the AT I was on, I was there...in their hotel...eating their food and enjoying whatever else the town offered. I can't say that I was in the best of moods when I hit the trail again on Friday, but I wasn't ready to quit yet. A 12 mile hike put me at Low Gap Shelter. It wasn't nearly as crowded and I had started to see enough faces on the trail where I was striking up conversations with said faces. That helped.I was going to make the next shelter on Saturday but as I was nearing Unicoi Gap, I met this family hiking on the trail. Struck up a conversation and found out they were going to Helen. Boom. I was Helen bound. Stayed overnight and watched the Final Four, had the best German meal I have ever had including Emmi's and watched the tourons milling around town. Worried about finding a ride out of town the entire time I was there (that helpless feeling again). Got up the next morning, called a cab that wanted $30 to take me back (a 9 mile trip). I said no to that and stuck out the thumb. Two rides later I was on the trail shortly after 8AM. Again I had planned to hike to Deep Gap shelter but right before I got there I met 3 weekend warriors who were going back to Hiawassee. My feet were absolutely killing me but I popped down an Ibupropan and I was good for the next 4 miles and another 17 mile day. Turns out I got a ride from a completely different person (good guy) because I had beaten the young Turks back to Dicks Creek gap. I took the bird in the hand and here I am in Hiawasse sleeping in another soft bed after taking a hot shower and eating an embarressingly large amount of food. Really roughing it....haha. Plus it turns out the hotel I'm staying at actually offers a free shuttle back to the AT tomorrow morning. Sweet! I'll be back on the trail by 9AM. Needless to say, I'm in a much better frame of mind. You know I heard that 40% of thru-hikers quit before they leave the state of Georgia. I believe it. It's quite the rude shock and Georgia is flat out tough hiking. It gets better in North Carolina and the trail is already showing improvement. Plus I will be in North Carolina tomorrow. How about that. Physically my feet still hurt but the heel is slowly improving and even after only a week I feel I am getting in form physically. Even taking a day off I averaged 11+ miles a day this week. I'll do better once this foot completely heals.Some things I need to get are a cheap watch, iodine pills, and a cell phone that gives you the limited minutes and you throw away afterwards. Turns out there are numerous reasons to have one. You can call for shuttles (although people seem very eager to give you a ride) and reserve a room ahead of time. Not sure I need either since the crowd for hotels is already diminishing. But being able to call for shuttle sounds pretty nice to me. Plus I could call the ones I love every now and then not to mention coordinate those mail drops.Speaking of which: Chad my shoes are holding up fine right now 79 miles into the trip. Buying some much needed insoles helped the situation. I'll try to keep you apprised of the situation as best possible. I will probably write next from Franklin, NC in a couple of days or If I skip that town then 4-5 days from Wesser, NC. Skip a town? Are you crazy? Of course I'll correspond in a couple of days. Plus it might time for a down day although I am going to try and make that at Wesser which is located on the Nantahala River. We'll see. That place could be crowded. That's the thing: each day is it's own adventure. What to do, when, and how. And in the meantime, left, right, left, right. I love all you guys. Lee stay strong. We'll talk to all later.      ","appalachian trail

Tried to activate through the phone and the internet and encountered problems on both avenues. Hopefully I will be able to get that thing activated some time this week.

If I hadn't been so predetermined to make Franklin, I really think I could have done 20 today. I'm in pretty good shape for only 8-9 days (I lose count) on the trail. Wish I could say the same about my camping gear. My 40 degree sleeping bag with a liner is just not getting it done. Two cold, uncomfortable nights in a row have made me realize I've got to do something about it. The elevations have gone up since I've gotten into NC and are only going to get worse as I head for the Smokies. I need another bag or a down blanket. The bag is expensive and the blanket is at my home.But I might be going home for a bit. There is an artic blast coming into the area this weekend with a pretty good chance of snow.   I think I'll miss that. I can do that since this is my trip. So I've rented a car like a rich man and I might drive home (which really is not that far away) and dump some stuff I'm not using and pick up a few things I should have brought...like that blanket.Still too many people but it is thinning out. Lost that 40% already that didn't get out of GA. Plus I met some really nice kids...a guy and a girl...not together...that I had a lovely conversation with over dinner tonight. We actually talked about stuff other than camping, hiking, and biking. Enjoyable. Anyway, I'm not going back on the trail until Sunday or Monday when it gets warmer. So I'm either gonna' kill time here in the area or head home for a bit. Chad, the shoes are beginning to show some wear. I have after all gone over the 100 mile mark as of yesterday. I'm probably around 115. I would know but I lost my damn AT book with all the data in it. That's something else I need to get before I get on the trail. Back to the shoes: I'll keep you posted.Big news: I got the Go phone activated today. The number is 931-374-5932. I've a $2 a day plan which means that every day I use it, it will ring up $2...no matter how many times I use it that day. No use...no charge. So I will have it off a lot.

Made supper using one of my vaseline coated lint balls to start the fire since it had been sprinkling off and on in the afternoon.   Went to sleep when the sun went down and slept like a baby. No freaking noise except the ones nature provides. The blanket I brought back from home kept me nice and warm also.   I will probably do that as often as I can in the future.
