Ben F,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523655,"Only a few more weeks before the hike, my northbound thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail, and I'm definitely going stir crazy. My flight home is set, my start date is set, and I am prepared to set off on this big adventure. I'm trying to tie up all of the loose ends, so today I am creating a trail journal. I am not sure how much I will write in this before the trail, but I intend to have a post and image for every day of my hike.",,View Entry,"Feb 28, Sun",0
Ben F,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521855,"One of the most surprising developments to come out of my preparation: My new-found love of gear. This has a tiny backstory:Three years ago, I went on a ""backpacking trip"" for the first time. I had camped a lot, so I knew exactly what to bring: A shovel, an axe, 2 mess kits, a car camping tent, and another 40+ pounds of gear for what was essentially a 2 day walk around a lake in the early fall.I hated backpacking about 2 hours in...6 months later, something told me I needed to give backpacking another chance. I checked the weather, grabbed an old tarp, a $5 bug net, a fleece blanket, and some rope. A dozen granola bars and a small water filter later, and I realized I was just as prepared as I had been before, but this time everything weighed less than 5 pounds.That is when I realized how much freedom I had with a pack on.Now my kit is a bit more elaborate. I will post a complete list just before I start and will try writing a few gear reviews along the way.
That's all about me. From here on out, I will write about what I'm doing.",,View Entry,"Feb 29, Mon",0

The night was expected to be about 40 degrees but it got closer to 20. As this was my first night out with it, I was unprepared. Learned a lesson and am cautiously optimistic about using a hammock for my hike.",,Hammock Trial,"Mar 15, Tue",0
