Baked Potato ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528115,Tonight is my last night before I start the trail. I am so excited to be starting the adventure. I know that it is going to be tough but I am ready for the challenge. I have had an amazing trip in Atlanta and got to spend a great week with Laura before starting the trail. We spent two amazing days in the lodge at Amicolola Fall State Park. It made me think about the Walk in the Woods movie when they stay in the lodge before starting the trail. A little over a year ago I decided I was going to hike the Appalachian trail. I started to read so many different blogs. I was overwhelmed with all of the information but I knew that I could do it. There were so many questions that I had to answer. I had to figure out what gear I was going to buy and how I was going to do it. I decided that I was going to hike the whole trail with a hammock. This is brand new to me and I am excited to not be sleeping on the ground every night.  I was so out of shape for the trail and started to really work so hard to make sure I was in better shape for the trail. In a little over a year I lost over 50 pounds. It has been tough to get to this point but I focused on my goals which kept me pushing forward. I am looking forward to my start tomorrow. Dan,"

Baked Potato ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528267,What a first day on the trip. I started at the lodge and had to complete the approach trail. It was a tough start since it was all up hill to get to the top of springer mountain. You get so excited since you are starting the Appalachian trail and then you realize you still have to hike 8 miles just to get to the start. It is a little bit of a mood killer first thing in the morning.I reached the top of springer mountain and I was dripping in sweat. It has been a while since I really backpacked much. I am still getting used to all of the gear and getting my body all used to hiking and the gear. After leaving springer I decided I was going to hike to hawk mountain. It was about 8.1 miles away. I really had to start moving since I wanted to make sure I got there before sunset. I was not too bad a first since most of it was down hill but I realized I had to start going back up again to reach the shelter. About half way to the shelter I could start feeling my body hurting a little. It had been awhile and I was pushing myself on the first day. I finally reached the shelter and had about an hour to dark. I was able to cook dinner which I had cheesy pasta side and cubed chicken. It was supposed to be a pasta but it turned into a soup which was so good after the long day. It really warmed me up. I realize I need to back my bag a little different so I am able to reach everything that I need during the day. I am excited for my next day and we will see how far I go. Dan,"Akmicolola Falls Lodge

Baked Potato ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528479,"Day 2. Last night was great. I setup my hammock up and decided to not set up the tarp. I did not set up the tarp mostly for the reason that I has not used it yet and was nervous about setting it up in front of a group. It was nice since the moon was out and there were stars everywhere. Today was a long day. There was so many up and downs. The worst had to be sassafras mountain. The up section felt like it was straight up which was not too bad, but the down was. It was all rock and it was tough to get a solid footing and it was a killer on the knees. The rest of the day was not too badAs I only had a few miles left to get to woods gap the sun went over the side of the mountain and the wind picked up. I was so cold due to my sweaty shirt. I thought with starting the trail so late in the year there will only be a few thru hikers but I am starting to realize that there are a lot of us. I have not really found a group yet to hike will all day. It seems like I am always at a different speed and I have been hiking a lone mostly so far which is not too bad. The one thing I keep hearing is the percent of people that finish. I know that it is a tough adventure but it really brings you down when it is said all of the time. Tomorrow I head towards blood mountain and then on to Neal's Gap. I don't need to stop for food since I still have like 4 more days of it. Depending on how I feel I am looking at doing 15 miles tomorrow. Dan","hawk mountain shelter

Baked Potato ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528843,Sorry about yesterday. It was a long day of hiking. Last night we camped out on top of Wolf Laural top from the suggestion of Lost who attempted to thru hike in 2014. It was a beautiful spot on top of the ridge and the sunset was amazing. Waking up the next morning to the sunrise was beautiful. You were able to see it thru the trees as it rised over the mountain range. I decided that after a long day the previous day I was going to relax in camp. I did not leave til like 10 am. After hiking down into the first gap there was a surprise of some trail magic. There were two older guys who had all these tables setup and chairs. I was able to get a bag of chips and a cold soda. It was great to have something cold since usually my water is warm after I filter it. After the magic I had to hike up to the top of Wildcat mountain. It was tough. It did not help that I drank a can of soda right before I started up the mountain. It is not always the elevation that is bad but it is always the rocks. There is never a flat surface and when you are climbing up and down on the mountains you have to put so much more effort to lift up your feet. I was taking my time today and was working my way to low gap. There was a beautiful stream that was moving so fast. I thought about staying but it was only 4pm and I thought that I could hike another 7 miles to the next shelter. I was told that it was a somewhat flat hike. As I started up it was not too bad just a long 7 miles at the end of the day. When I got about half way there started to be a lot more steep ups and downs. It was starting to get windy and the sun was on the other side of the mountain. We finally reached the shelter and there were about 12 people already here. Most of the thru hikers. The worst part of the site was the water source. It was a little trickle out the side of a rock. It would take so long to fill up a 1 liter bottle. At one point we had a line of people to get water. Today I meet a person who was planning on stopping their adventure to Maine. He was having really bad knee problems and was not able to move quick. It really made me think about everything. An injury can happen at any point. You work so hard to plan and prepare that an injury could stop all of thatTomorrow I hope to have an easy day. I have been saying that everyday but that is the plan. Have a great nightDan,"wolf laural gap

Baked Potato ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529176,"So I work up at the Blue Mountain shelter. There was about 15 people there at night and when I got up there was only 3 people left. I was so tired from the previous hike that I wanted a relaxing morning. 
After hitting the trail I hiked down from Blue Mountain to unicoi gap. On the way down the switch backs I was able to see a tent in the distance. I got excited that there might be some more trail magic. When I finally got down to the bottom of the gap I was right. I could start to smell the hot dogs and hamburgers. The group welcomed me at the bottom of the trail and there was so much food. I found out I was the first one to show up so I guess it was a benefit for sleeping in. I had a hamburger and a hotdog. I have noticed that I really enjoy a cold soda after a long hike. I spent about a half hour with the group talking about college football and hiking. 
After a great start with some trail magic I had to start making the long hike to the top of Tray mountain. It was a tough hike to the top. Once on top the view was amazing. You were able to see all of the different mountains and landscapes. I spent about an hour on top just relaxing and enjoying the view. I was able to talk to Laura for a while which was amazing and a great pick me up. I still wanted to get some good miles in so I started to head down the mountain. The rest of the hike was not too bad. There were a few ups and down but nothing was too steep. I went thru an area that was called the swag of the blue ridge. I was a relatively flat area and I was able to move quickly. It was starting to get late in the day and I knew that I wanted to get to sassafras gap to setup camp since there was water there. I kept on hiking and I thought I was getting closer but I was not finding the gap. Finally when I was getting tired I saw over the ridge the site and there was about 10 different tents setup. The biggest problem with arriving late to a site with a hammock is finding some good hammock trees. I was able to find a spot and by the time that I got water and setup camp it was dark. I was sitting in the dirt with my headlamp cooking my pasta side with summer sausage. After cooking the food it was amazing to just lay in the hammock and enjoy the hot food. 
What a day

Baked Potato ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529182,Today was a good day. I started in Sassafras Gap and had a short hike into town today to reapply. It was a super windy night and was knocking my hammock and trap all around last night. I still slept great and did not want to get out of bed since it was so comfortable and relaxing. There was a good climb today to the top of Kelly Knob which was straight up then right back down. After the climb up it was a nice relaxing hike to the bottom of the gap. On the way to the gap I knew that I was going to be staying in town for the night and called the budget inn motel. I was lucky since I was able to get the last room. The only problem was that I was going to get to the gap at 1230 and the next shuttle was not coming til 3. It was a 12 mile hike into town. I did not want to wait so I started to hike into town and I figured I would hitch hike. I guess I was not good looking enough to get a ride. After about a mile hike down the road I figured I would hike back up to the gap since I knew that the shuttle would take me. I wanted to make sure that I had a ride. When I got back up to the gap I saw Lone Star and he asked me what happened. He was going to stay with his aunt and uncle for the night and were nice enough to take me into town. I sat in the back of the pick up to town and saw the beautiful landscape that surrounds Hiawassee. Once in town I arrived at the budget inn. It was a small little motel. It was great to get a nice room with a shower for the night. I was able to resupply in town and got enough food for 6 days which should get me to Fontana Dam right before the smoky mountains.   Well it has been a long day and tomorrow I am back on the adventure north.

Baked Potato ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529352,Today was a tough day mentally. I was not able to charge my powerpack in town last night. For some reason it did not want to charge so I have very little battery for 5 days. Once I left the town back to the trail head it started to rain on the trail. It rained all day. I was so wet and cold. I thought so many times if this for me. I was just thinking how nice it would be to be in a bed under the covers. It was tough to get excited today cMost of the day was rain. I was excited that I officially finished Georgia. It is the fist state down I crossed over and set up camp on the NC side. It was nice to have finish a state and tells you that you are reaching your goals. They say that about 25 % of people do not cross into NC and finish those hike before that point. I was so happy to cross the state but I still know that there is so much to go I am going to keep it short so I can go to bedNightDan,"Dick Creek Gap

Baked Potato ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529854,"Sorry about the delay in my journal. I have not had much battery life the past few days. I am lucky that my amazing girlfriend is going to send me some extra powerpacks to make sure I always have battery. 
This morning I woke up early to get a good start and I was still one of the last people in camp. I am not sure what time people are starting their hikes. There is usually always one person who is still at camp cooking a high end meal as I walk out with my brown sugar pop tarts. First thing in the morning I had to climb and down winding stairs. It was a tough climb because my ankle is still bothering me and the blister on my heel has not healed yet. Once I got going and my body loosen up I felt better. I was able to talk to Laura around mid morning which was a great pick me up. I finished in winding stair gap there was a lot of people waiting for the shuttle into town for a resupply. I still had three days of food so I did not need to go to town. 
What I noticed today was that everyone I have been seeing over the past week must have gone into town and I was hiking with a totally different crowd. It was weird. Today was mostly uphill. For the first part of the day it was a nice up hill with gradual slopes. Not too bad. The second part was rough. It was straight up hill and there were so many loose rocks. It was tough to get a solid steps. 
Once on top it was great. There was this amazing view that overlooked the whole valley. There was a map that showed all of the peaks. The farthest peaks where the smoky mountains. It was crazy how far away they still are. Tomorrow is another day

Baked Potato ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532058,"Today I left Hot Springs NC. It was nice to get a day off from the trail but I have realized that my body has become tight from sitting around for the day. I packed my bag for the road and I was able to weigh it before I left. With five days of food and no water my pack was at 33 pounds. With the amount of water that I carry it would be around 41 pounds. After not putting on my pack yesterday it felt so heavy leaving town. Hot springs was an interesting place and was a great place to take a zero. The greatest part of the day was that the sun was out all day and I had to put on some sunscreen. It had been a while at that point that the weather was this nice. 
I decided that I was only going to do 11 miles and after hanging around the hostel and eating some food I got a late start up to the shelter. It was a rough climb today. Most of the day was up hill and after getting the late start I was pushing myself to get done as quick as I could do that I would have some sunlight let to set up camp. The first part of the climb was cool because it over looked the town and the river below. You were able to seen for such a long distance.
So about two weeks ago we all heard about a wild fire that was going on in Hot Springs that had shut down the trail. I was able to hike in the area where the wildfire had gone thru and it was a large area. Almost all day during the 11 miles I was able to see fresh burn marks on trees. I heard that there was a wildfire area and a controlled burn area. It looked like you could tell the difference on the two different burns but besides a few hot spots where it looked like trees were hit hard. It looked like it will really help the forest. Walking thru the woods and being able to smell all of the smoke really made me miss work and conducting prescribed fire. It was so interesting seeing fire in a oak and maple dominated forest compared to Sandhill in Florida. 
I think the last half mile was the worst because i always thought I was going to see the shelter over ever little hill but there was no luck. Finally after going over one more ridge I was able to see the top of the shelter. I was so happy. 
I was happy til I realized that the water source was down the ridge side and it was steep. After taking a break before getting water I could feel all of the pain from the hike today and the areas that were fighting up.","Hot Springs
",Spring Mountain Shelter,"May 08, Sun",11
Baked Potato ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532770,"So today was a tough day. It looked easy on the map but it ended up being tough on the body. The morning was mostly down hill which was not bad. There was supposed to be just one hill that I had to climb. The climb was about 5 miles up hill and it seems like it was never going to end. Most of the sections were straight up the mountain and not the usually gradual slope up hill. 
One I reached the top of the mountain I was covered in sweat. When I got to the top I saw Dregs and ChickenHawk taking a break on the top. The rest of the day was supposed to be easy but it was so tough. The section was mostly rocks and was tough on the knees. I reached a place called whiterock cliff and the view was amazing. You were able to see so far. 
The next section of the trail looked flat but it was not. I reached a section in the trail where there was two trails. There was detour trail the was labeled the bad weather trail. I was a little worried about how bad the weather could be on the trail. The trail was an amazing ridge walk that took five years to create. There were so many amazing views that you could see 360. The ridge walk was tough on the knees because you had to climb up and down the rocks the whole time and had to pick up your feet. I was so sore from that section on the hike but the views were worth it.","Spring Mountain Shelter

Baked Potato ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532772,"Today I woke up and it had rained for most of the night. It was still raining off and on in the morning and I figured I would sleep in since I was only planning on doing 10 miles today. Every time I tired to go back to sleep I was woken back up by some loud thunder. I could start to hear all of the other hikers start to rustle around and I could not sleep anymore. I was lucky that I camped right next to the shelter so I could bring all of gear into the shelter and back it out of the rain. It was nice to be able to just sit in the dry shelter and eat my pop tarts before hitting the trail. 
About 5 miles into the trail I realized I did not remember backing my wallet and was so worried that I lost it. So in the middle of the woods I unpacked everything and found it at the bottom of my pack. It was such a pain to repack in the rain. 
The morning was a little rough since it was raining most of the morning. If would stop for a little but then would pick right back up again. I was getting a little concerned about the storm coming since I could still hear thunder. I reached a meadow with Dregs and chickhawk on top of a ridge and the storm broke for a little to be able to really enjoy the view. It was one of the first really nice views on the trail so far because almost every view has been fogged in. It was really cool to walk across the bald and it was so open to see all around. 
I had to start working my way up the mountain now to reach the top of bald mountain. The climb was not too bad and a lot of the trail was winding around the mountain and not straight up it. As I was making my way up the mountain I could see Dregs and Chickenhawk in the distance and I saw a cooler on the ground. I did not get too excited at first since usually they are empty. When I approached I could tell that they were enjoying some snacks. It was an interesting place for a cooler since I had been going up hill for a few miles and had not seen an access point. I wonder how they got the cooler there. When I opened the cooler there were cookies, hard boiled eggs and milk. I was a little hesitant at first since you never know how long but there was still ice and I had a hard boiled egg. I was not going to have any milk but another hiker named bubblehead showed up and said that it hit the spot. I had a glass of cold milk and it really hit the spot. It helped me propel myself up to the top of the mountain. I grabbed a cookie to go that was in plastic bag to eat as I hiked. 
I realized about a half mile after the trail magic I had lost my cookie. I must have dropped it on the trail. 
I finally reached the top of bald mountain and the view was amazing. It was so open and there was no fog anywhere. The rain had stopped at this point for a little and the sun was starting to peak out. It was still super windy but I just was taking in all of the views. I saw a few camp spots and I have started to realized that with the hammock I really will not be able to camp on top of the balds or in the fields. I will always have to find a few trees. 
After taking some photos on top of the mountain I made my way down the mile to the shelter. The hike was nothing hard but from all of the rain it was very slippery. It made it so tough to not slide down the trail. It was like for every step that you took you got an extra free step from the sliding. I was working my way down when I hit a really soft spot and slid down. I was lucky that I was able to catch myself with my one hand before my pack was covered in a soupy mud. I was happy my hand was there but it was so tough to get up. I did not want to get on my knees and every time I tried to get up I just kept sliding. I was so tough to get up and I could feel it in my knees after. Lucky I was right next to the shelter when it happened and I could relax
It was weird getting to the shelter so ealry. I am usually one of the last people at the shelter but today I arrived first with two other hikers. It was nice being able to dry out all of my gear and relax a little before setting up camp and cooking dinner. I have been getting really hungry on the trail and have been carrying two dinners for most nights just in case. I had ramen noodles tonight with tuna. It really hit the spot. I was reading the shelter log and there was an entry from another hiker talking about a Chinese buffet in town. All you have to say to a hiker is buffet and you get there attention. I have been thinking about it a lot now and I am interested to check it out when I get to town on Friday. 
Still a little cold at night and the wind is not helping but I have been so confortable in the hammock that I sleep right thru the night

Baked Potato ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533003,Last night was a little cold. I stayed at the shelter in my hammock just south of the big bald. It was a really windy night. The wind was so strong that it was pushing my tarp up against the hammock and I could feel the cold air most of the night. I was only planning on doing 10 miles today since I had an extra day to get into Erwin TN. I woke up early and wanted to hike quick to the next shelter to make sure that I was able to avoid the rain storm that was coming. I started working my way to the next shelter and there was a .1 side trail to the top of this place called High Rocks. The high to the top was tough since it was just climbing over rocks to get to the top. Once on the top the view was amazing. I was able to see for such a far distance and the sun started to peak thru. I stayed up there for about an hour and half having lunch and relaxing. I talked to Laura for a while and it was nice not being in a rush since I was only doing 10 miles. I started to worry about the rain again and started to make my way to camp. I was working my way down hill and I could start to see the difference in the habitat as I made my way downhill. I was entering an eastern hemlock forest and there were many different streams that were crossing the trail. The trail was getting so wet and was super slippery. There were a few times that I would slide like 3 extra feet with every steep. I could start to hear the thunder in the back ground and could hear the storm coming. I started to make my way up hill again and was walking up this awesome stream bank. There stream was flowing really well and there were a few foot bridges that I had to cross along the trail. It was nice and relaxing this part of the trail. The last section of the trail was nice and had a gradual up hill and down hills.I was almost to the shelter when I looked at the map and there were no water sources at the shelter. So I had to get water about .3 away from the shelter. I was going to get 5 liters of water for camp and I wanted to make sure that I only got water at the closest stream. There was so many streams and I did not want to carry the extra 15 pounds too far. I finally think I found the right stream and got all of my water. The final .3 miles to the shelter were up hill and I was a tough .3. I was tired from the long day and my pack was so heavy. I set up my gear in the shelter since the storm was going to be bad and I wanted to keep everything dry since I am getting off the trail tomorrow for a few days for Caitlin's Med school graduation and getting to see Laura. I am excited to see everyone. It has been a long first month on the trail. Finally,"Bald Mountain Shelter

There was 7 people in a single cab pickup truck. It was not too bad at first til the rain started and it was just soaking us. I threw my jacket over my head just to stay warm and dry. 
When I finally got to the trailhead it was raining so I threw on my rain jacket and pants. Today was not too bad. The first part was working up the mountain after leaving the gap. The slope was not bad but it was all mud so every step I slid back a little. It was tough to get up the hill. 
The rest of the way was working my way down hill to the next hostel. I decided to stay at a hostel since it is going to pour this night and I wanted to keep all my gear dry. 
I only hiked 13 miles today but it was so tough since I was hiking in mud all day and took a lot to pick up my feet. I always tried to avoid the mud and walk around it but I would always slid into the mud and I could not avoid it. Everything was covered in mud and my feet felt so heavy

Baked Potato ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534504,Getting out of the hostel was tough this morning since it was warm in the room and cold outside. Staying in the hostels are tough since you don't want to leave and get back to the trail. I got back on the trail and I was rocking my rain pants so that I did not get my pants covered in mud. I was getting tired of my pants covered in mud and then in drying on my pants. The terrain was not too bad in the morning just having to deal with the constant mud and sliding up and down on all of the little hills. There was just so much mud and water it was like soup in many areas that it was hard to avoid the mud. My rain pants were covered in mud and I was so happy that it was not on my pants. Most of morning I was in the valley and there was very little sign of sunlight coming thru. It was a cold windy day but atleast it was not raining. I ate lunch at the shelter and started to work my way uphill and the weather started to get a lot nicer. The sun was out and was becoming a beautiful day. There were some really nice views along the way. After hiking up to the top of the ridge I could start to see some fire damage. There was a recent wildfire that spread across the trail. It looked really recent and you could still smell the fire in the air. I really miss that smell. I made the decent to the road where there were two different hostels. I checked them out and got a soda and a bag of chips before I hit the trail again. I was about 2 miles from camp and started working my way down to the shelter. It was a little tough since it was steps going down and it was hard on the knees. I made my way down and reached the laurel falls. The falls were amazing. It was very relaxing sitting there for a little. I made my way to the shelter and it was on a hill with no camping or any trees to hang my hammock. I made my way down the trail and found an amazing spot on the river. Time for dinner. Dan,"Vango Hostel

Baked Potato ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534678,Today was a big day for me. My first 20+ mile day. It was tough at times but I am so happy to finally hit that mark. Sleeping next to the river was perfect. I woke up and I was still tired but I knew that I wanted to hike a big day. I even set an alarm. I hit the snooze button a few times since it was a little cold in the morning. I finally left camp around 830 and started down the trail. The first thing in the morning was a long 3 mile hike to the top of the mountain. Ups are always my worst and they usually take me a lot longer. Today was not too bad. It was mostly switchbacks that slowly brought me up to the top of the mountain. There were no views from the top so I started my way down to the bottom which would bring me out to a lake. When I reached the bottom of the mountain there was a deer walking in the road. It was a buck with little buttons but did not seemed bother by hikers walking near him. After the hike to the bottom there was a lake with a recreation area. In the distance I could see a bathroom and hikers always love a real bathroom. It was a nice little area and I took advantage of the trash cans but I did not have to use the bathroom. The hike around the lake was really nice. There was a shelter near the lake but it had to be shut down due to so much bear activity in the area. After hiking around the lake I made it to the dam. The trail goes across the dam and I sat there for a while and had lunch while taking in the first nice day in a while. It was just relaxing and I was ready to take a nap but I had a big day ahead of me. After the dam I had to start making my way up to the top of the next mountain. This one was similar with many switchbacks and all but it was really tough. It seemed to go on forever. The hardest part was usually on the map there are location along that way that help tell you how much farther to the top like a stream or a gap but not today. The only way I knew I made it to the top was when I started to go down. After the long hike up the rest of the day was a ridge walk with ups and downs but nothing that was too crazy. I made it to a shelter and took a little break before the final 7 miles to the next shelter. There was a beautiful view from the shelter of the lake and the surrounding area. I started to push on. I was working my toward the next shelter when I saw a hikers coming southbound and kept looking behind him. I figured he had a dog or someone he was waiting for. I started talking him and he told me there was a bear right next to the trial and he backed off to give it room. I got really excited to see a bear since I just missed seeing a bear in the Smoky Mountains. He seemed concerned about the bear and I told him I used to work with bears and we should go check it out. I really wanted to see a bear. As we approached the area I did not see anything and was becoming disappointed and then all of a sudden there was a bear sitting about 50 feet of the trail with not a care in the world. We walked by it and it did not move. It must have been used to people. It was an adult bear around 20 pounds with a beautiful coat and had a brown spot on its side. It looks like a young bear. I was going to keep going and let the bear be but I thought there were a few hikers behind me that I did not want to be scared by the bear. I yelled a few times and shuffled my feet a little and the bear ran over the hill. I figured he was not going far but atleast he was not on the trail anymoreI was getting close to camp when I saw a barred owl fly over the trail and land on a tree near the trail. I stopped for a little to watch the guy and see what he would do. When I started to walk again I could tell it was a long day. Everything was starting to get tight and took a little to get started. I made my way towards the shelter and the final water source was .2 away from the shelter so I wanted to get enough water for dinner and enough to start hiking in the morning. I grabbed 5 litters and it was the toughest .2 of the day. It added like an extra 15 pounds to a body that was already tired but I finally saw camp and knew that I completed my day. Another day tomorrow to see what the world will hold,"un named campsite.

Baked Potato ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534839,So today was a tough day to wake up. I think after doing 22 miles yesterday and getting into camp around 8pm I needed a good night sleep. I finally got up around 9 and there were still a lot of people around. I think a lot of people had a long day the previous day. Getting out of the hammock at first was tough because my knee was hurting. Ever since I fell it has been bothering me a little. I stretched it out a little and that seemed to help. I also took some vitamin I to help. I finally got motivated and left camp around 10am. The terrain was easy today. I was hiking along and there were really no big ups or downs just a lot of little hills. When I came around the bend I could hear voices and I saw the first shelter. It was crazy how fast I had gotten there and it did not seem like I really worked that hard. There were a few hikers from the pervious shelter eating lunch so I joined them. I have started to take more lunch breaks recently and relax and enjoy my lunch. Before I would have a pocket full of snacks and just eat all day. I made a peanut butter and Nutella sandwich and it was nice to just relax for a little. After lunch I only had about 8 more miles. The terrain looked mostly flat and for the next three miles it has a gradual down hill. I was moving really quick on the down hills. I reached an area that was a little wetter and it was like a tunnel of mountain laurel that you had to walk thru. There were many little footbridges to stay dry. It was really cool because it was almost dark in there. I reached the next gap and took another 30 minute break. I knew I was only going to go to the last shelter before the town so I was in no rush with the easy terrain. After the 3 miles the last part of the day was mostly up to get to the last shelter but really it was a very little climb. There was never an steep hills or switchbacks. It mostly just ran along the ridge line. I really think that I could get used to this. I finally reached camp around 6 pm and it was weird becuase usually by this part of the day I am so tired and covered in sweat. I rolled in with a smile on my face and a dry shirt. The smile was gone quick when I found out the water source was down a steep .2 mile hill. I grabbed all of my bottles and made it to the bottom. I had ripped my one bottle the other day so I had to hold my hand over the hole as I used the bottle to filter the water. Every time I squeezed the bottle water would get all over me. It took me so much time to filter the water. I guess in the next town I will need to get a new bottle. The climb back up was worst. It seemed like it never wanted to end and mentally I was done for the day so I was just so tired. I finally made it up the hill with 4 liters of water to last the night and hopefully all of the way to town since I hear this is the last water source before town. Which is still 10miles but it is all down hill. Looking forward to getting to town tomorrow and would love to find some Chinese food. I have been craving it for a while and all you do on the trail is think about food and talk about food with other hikers. Time for bed. Fun Fact -A bear has 42 teeth,"Iron Mountain Shelter

Baked Potato ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537644,"Yesterday was a long day so I slept in and did not get on the trail til like 10am. I was just so comfortable in the hammock that I did not want to get going. The only reason I got up was because I had to go to the bathroom. 
I had a 10 mile hike to get to Pine Grove Furnace State Park. After about 2 miles I past the half point on the Appalachian trail. It was a great cool moment but at the same time felt weird since it was not my half point. I guess I will have to calculate where my half point will be so I can get excited. 
The trail was pretty easy on the way to the state park. It was rocky but at the same time I was moving at a good pace. I arrived at the state park around 1:30. The state park is the location of the half gallon challenge of ice cream. I was thinking about doing the challenge but it did not feel right since it was not my half point. As I rolled up to the site I can see a few different hiker laid out sleeping. I guess the challenge was not so friendly for them. The state park was cool because it had a AT museum where you could see all of the historical things from the trail and all of the different people who had made the trail what it is today. 
After leaving the museum there was fuller lake which is a little recreation area with swimming but it was cool because they had some showers. I was able to get a hot shower for the first time in a week and feel a little clean even tho I put my dirty clothes back on after the shower. I was also able to wash my underwear in the sink real quick. It is the simple things in life. 
I finally left the park after a few hours and started to head to camp. I decided to just go to the next shelter and call it a night there. It was 7 miles away but it went by so fast. I was at camp in like a little over two hours. I was surprised when I came up to the sign for the shelter. I don't know if the terrain is really easy or my body and legs are feeling good and just getting better. I realized that the shelter was on a side trail about .2 away and I looked to my left and there was a beautiful river with a few spots. I decided to set up camp there for the night and enjoy the sound of the stream. 
Tomorrow I am going to try my first marathon hike. It is a 12 mile hike to Boiling Springs to get some food but after that there is no camping for 14.3 miles since we have to hike on the road. It is going to be a long day but I am excited for my biggest day yet.","Birch Run Shelter

Baked Potato ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537834,26.3!!!!!!!!!!!!!So I completed my first marathon hike and I am not sure I am going to do that again. It is rough on the body to be hiking that long.I finally got out of camp around 9am. I knew I should have gotten going earlier but I was just so comfortable. There was a little chill in the air so it was nice to just lay there and not move. So I knew I was going to hike the marathon today and I was hoping that the terrain would not be too bad. The first 8 miles were a killer. Today was the hottest day on the trail yet reaching about 90 degrees. The terrain was really Rocky and it was just up and down all morning. It was not like a gradual up or down they were all quick ups and downs. I was making really good time it was just rough going. There was one cool section that was called the rock maze. It was on the ridge where you had to follow the arrows as you went thru different rock openings. I had to take it slow to not hurt myself but it was aa really interesting part. After about 12 miles into the day I reached Boiling Springs. The first thing I see when I get to the town was a water park and some water slides. I was really tempted to go relax but I wanted to keep going. Boiling Spings in the location of one of the AT offices so I dropped off my pack there and headed to the gas station for some soda and chips. I sat at a picnic table and really enjoyed my mt dew and chips. I got two bags of chips and put one in my pack for a camp. It was nice to just relax and feel the breeze on this hot day. After about an hour I knew that if I did not leave soon I would not be able to make it to camp before dark. I started on the 14 mile trek to camp. It was all flat mostly but it was already 3 pm so I was going to have to book it. I was going at a good pace and was able to get 8 miles done in about two hours. I stopped for a little for some trail major along the road of some drinks. The hike was not too bad. It was taking me thru all of the different farm lands and had to cross many roadsAt this point I had to slow down a little. With all of the heat and the sweat I was starting to get some chaffing. It did not feel great. With me losing more weight on the trail my underwear has started to get too big and becoming too baggy. I brought one smaller pair just in case so I will have to start wearing them mostly. Luckly I am heading to my parents house in about a week where I can change out some of my clothes and gear. I still had about 6 more miles to go. The next four I slowed down a little and was walking on different boardwalks around the river. It was a nice little hike but I had the constant reminder of the sun that was starting to worry me. I finally reached the point where I only had 2 miles left but it was all up hill. The shelter was located at the top of the ridge. You had to go all of the way to the shelter because all of the land from Boiling Springs to the shelter was private property and there was no camping. As I started to make the trek up the mountain I saw a sign about a mile from camp that the water was poor at the shelter and to get it here. I usually like to grab 5 liters of water for the night so I have enough to cook with and don't have to get water in the morning. All of this extra weight just made the last mile so tough. I knew I was almost there but I was going so slow. My body must have realized that it was time to shut down. I finally made it to camp at 830. I had completed my goal hiking 26 miles in one day. I had just enough light to setup camp and lay down. Tomorrow on for a resupply and the start of the PA rocks.,"James Fry Shelter
