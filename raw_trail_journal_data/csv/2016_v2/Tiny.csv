Tiny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554134,"Originally planned to do a few days of hiking but was shortented to 1 day when one of the party got really cold the first night. We started hiking at 8:45. Trail was nice and flat but it was chilly and windy. Sun was out off and on. Not a lot to see. The C&O canal path along the Potomac River was pretty. Crossed into Harpers Ferry on a cool RR bridge. Town was very historic, would love to come back some time. Car was parked just outside of town. Miles went by very fast and we were back at car by 1:00 pm.","Crampton Gap MD

Tiny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554135,"Mary Kat, Lisa, Clarence and I drove to Great Barrington MA Friday night and stayed in a hotel. In the morning we went to the local diner for breakfast. We drove to the trail, the ladies hiked with us for a little before heading back to the car. Long hard day with a tough uphill at the very end. Some nice hiking through farm fields during the day. Nice views from Jug End and Mt Everett. Lots of people on the trail, chatted with a few thru hikers. Even had a guy pray with us for a safe hike.","Homes Rd MA

Tiny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554136,"Easier day today, left camp by &:30, a little drizzle in the morning but sunny in the afternoon. Couple of nice views and a lot of people out today. No fires allowed in CT so Clarence is bummed. Cool little mound made out of stones on top of Bear Mtn, highest point in CT, was built in 1800 something. Saw the giant thumb, a big half buried rock sticking out of the ground that looked like a thumb. Sages Ravine had a bunch of cool waterfalls. Got to camp at 5:00, had to walk .5 miles down a hill to reach shelter. Campsite was nice, had a relaxing evening.","Race Brook Falls Campsite

Tiny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554137,"Got on trail around 7:00am, had to climb back up the steep .5 mile trail to get back to A.T. Easiest day so far, we took more breaks. Had nice long flat stretch in the morning, made great time. Saw a dam with a nice waterfall. Trail went right by a waterfall which was unusual. In the afternoon we could hear cars racing from a long way off, eventually we came to an overlook and could see the Limerock race track with cars going around and around. Hot day, saw a beaver dam, got to camp around 5:00. I was walking by a guy who already had his tend set up and his back to me, when he heard me he spun around and put his hands up in a karate chop pose like someone was about to attack him, he said we scared him. He came over a few times that night to talk about the weather and trail ahead. Looks like rain tonight and tomorrow.","Limestone Spring Shelter

Tiny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554139,"On the trail by 6:15 to get to town early. Rained during the night, I packed up under my tarp. Sprinkled in the morning then the sun came out. Most of the views were cloudy. Had one big steep rocky climb with a rock scramble. Got ot the road and walked into town. Nice small town, went to hotel, no one was there but key was taped to the door. Went into the room and it stared to rain like crazy. After the rain stopped we went to laundry and grocery store. Laundry mat was weird, cloths hanging everywhere and bags of cloths piled on the washers. Went back and forth to grocery to get things we forgot. Had burger and beer for dinner. Watched TV in the room and went to bed.","Cesar Brook Camp

Tiny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554140,"Got up, packed, had breakfast at local diner, breakfast fajita. Big climb out of town as normal. Day was not bad, hills are getting smaller as we head south. Lots of people out on trail today. Talked with a couple who were doing a 29 mile day today. Nice walk along a river with cool pedestrian bridge. Set up camp and Clarence made a fire, they were not allowed in CT so now that were are in NY he had to make one.","Kent CT
",Wiley Shelter,"May 25, Wed",12.70
Tiny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554142,"On trail by 7:15, hot day today. A lot of swamps and boardwalks, very buggy. walked through a lot of fields. Stopped at a garden center that was hiker friendly. They sell some supplies and drinks, let hikes get water and rest. Passed the AT RR station, it runs all the way to NY city. Took forever to get to shelter, a couple of other hikers there.","Wiley Shelter
",Morgan Stewart Shelter,"May 26, Thu",16.60
Tiny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554143,"On trail by 6:30, hot today but not too bad. Trail was rocky, hills not too bad. Went to a deli .4 off trail. Got a breakfast sandwich, hoagie for lunch and some snacks. Hiked for a ways and stopped to get water but there were signs posted that said it was polluted from nearby farms. Had to go a few more miles to fill up, was totally out of water when we reached a stream. Stopped at RPH shelter which is fully enclosed, has a well, and you can get pizza delivered there. We got close to the road that lead to the campground and it started to pour. We got soaked walking the road to the campground. Kind of scary because in some parts there was no room to get off the road, people were going 55 mph and it was raining super hard. Went to the free campsites for hikers and they were terrible, no place to hang hammocks.","Morgan Stewart Shelter
",Clarence Fahnestock Park,"May 27, Fri",16
Tiny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554171,"Started out at 6:30, had to stop at park office to get water because the water at the campground was not good to drink. Met 2 guys doing a section hike, they gave us a ride back to the trail in the back of their truck. Very nice, saved us a 1 road mile walk. Long hot day but not hard terrain. Decided to hike a few extra miles to make tomorrow easier. Lots of hikers out. Stopped at a deli after lunch, had a Gatorade, ice cream, and a sandwich for dinner. Made it to camp by 4:00, campsite was rough, no one was there a no water. We thought about moving on but there was no place else to go, we eventually found some spots to set up. Later some thru hikers arrive and we had a nice talk with a section hiker.","Clarence Fahnestock Park
",Hemlock Springs Camp,"May 28, Sat",16
Tiny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554172,"Easy hike downhill to the pickup spot. The hike across the Bear Mtn Bridge was cool. Trailside zoo was closed so hike the overgrown bypass trail. It was Memorial Day weekend, the park was a total mess, trash everywhere from Sat picnics. Even at 8:00am Sun morning people were setting up foe the day. We had to wait a few hours for Grandad to arrive. We passed the time watching the traffic disaster that was people trying to figure out how to get into the parking lot, traffic backups, people stopping in the middle of the street, ect. He eventually arrived and we drove home.","Hemlock Springs Camp

Tiny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554187,"Started at Lafayette Campground parking lot, it was full by 9:00am, busy Memorial Day weekend, trails were packed. Took the Pemi Trail 3 miles to AT so total distance hikes was 6 miles but only 3 were on AT. Pemi Trail was easy, very pretty, along a nice stream with lots of waterfalls. At one spot there was a girl with a giant hammer and skimpy outfit getting her picture taken. She was doing some kind of cosplay photo shoot I assume. The hike up Liberty Spring Trail was steep, long and rocky. Arrived at camp around 2:00, had a nice chat with the caretaker, it is suppose to be busy tonight at camp. Weather was nice, a little warm, camp was packed by dark.","Franconia Notch NH

Tiny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554188,"On trail by 7:00am, climb up to the ridge was not too bad, had perfect weather all day. After a few miles made it above treeline, views were amazing. Walked along the ridge with mountains all around, it was perfect Made a left off the ridge and headed down the trail towards Greenleaf Hut. Long way down, so many people coming up. For 3 hours I went down, passing people coming up, never more than a min on 2 went by that I did not see someone. Did a total of 7 - 8 miles that day but only 4 were on AT. Made it down to car, drove to Gorham, got pizza, supplies, subway for dinner, then off to the lodge at Pinkham Notch to stay for the night.","Liberty Springs Campsite
",Mt. Lafayette NH,"Sep 04, Sun",3.70
Tiny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554189,"Shuttle driver took me from Pinkham Notch (where I left my car) to Grafton Notch ME. Took less than an hour and had a nice conversation along the way. Hike south out of Grafton Notch was long and uphill, but I felt good. The view from Old Speck Mtn was amazing. Called Lisa on the phone. Crazy downhill to Mahoosic Notch. The notch was fun but pretty dangerous in parts. People said it would take 2 - 4 hours to go the 1 mile but it took me 1:15, I was rushing though and took some chances I should not have. Had to muscle through a bunch of spots. SOBO blazing in the notch was terrible. Last uphill before camp was tough, I was beat and had no energy. Got in by 5:00. Only averaged 1 mph, hopefully tomorrow will be better. Couple of thru hikers here, no opportunity to talk.","Grafton Notch ME
",Full Goose Shelter ME,"Sep 05, Mon",9.70
Tiny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554190,"Good sleep last night, cloud with drizzle the morning. No views till the afternoon. Morning hike was slow and hard but afternoon was easier. The rock faces I had to descend were scary, slipped a few times but did not fall, had to slide down on my butt. On of the views in the afternoon was amazing. Met a british couple I had been following on YouTube which was fun, they were very nice and we had a nice talk. Made it to camp by 4:00, thought about going on but I was tired and my feet hurt. Shelter had a nice view and a beaver pond. Did some wash, rinsed off and tried to knock the stink down. Lots of thru hikers last 2 days. Answered a lot of questions from people asking about who was ahead of them since I was SOBO. Had 3 friendly frogs with me while I filtered water.","Full Goose Shelter ME

Tiny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554191,"Got an early start today, trail was surprisingly easy for NH. Couple of good views, not too much elevation change. Ran out of water a few miles from the end. Made it to hostel by 3:00. Nice place but packed with hikers. No shoes or hiking cloths allowed inside. Had pizza and ice cream, watched movies all evening. Stay came with breakfast and a shuttle ride back to car.","Gentian Pond Shelter NH
