Old Hiker 2016,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519101,"First prep journal entry: 56 days until Springer. 
These pre-hike posts will not be frequent again, as I'm still not much of a talker. 
This is my second attempt at the Appalachian Trail. My first attempt in 2012 ended at mile 497 with a severely sprained ankle with a cracked fibula after hitting a flat patch of mud, slipping and twisting to my right before coming down like a ton of bricks. 
My school system threw me a curve ball this year. They have moved the start of school BACK two weeks, to the first couple of weeks in AUG. My (very shaky) plan this time is to try and average 14-18 miles per day so I can finish in time to get back to work. I am NOT confident of this date based on my last attempt; however, with less gear/weight, better elevation training and a better expectation of what to……………expect ? , it’s doable. I know it will NOT be this mileage from the first, but it can be done with timing and care.
I have changed my gear a LOT to get rid of excess weight:
        New tent – LightHeart Gear SoLong 6
        New 20* quilt for the colder weather, with a new 40* quilt for the warmer weather
        New pack – Osprey Volt 75
        Less food and water
        Less clothing
I picked 29 Feb as a starting date again for several reasons: 
a.        It's my deceased mom's birthday
b.        It's fairly uncommon
c.        It gives me an extra day to complete the Trail!
Car rental is complete, hostel reservations are made and gear is pretty much ready. Bills are paid forward, so my wife won't have to worry about that. I do have a LOT of house/yard maintenance to complete, but that will fall in line. 
I really need to finish the stair project I started several months ago and have been struggling with since. Today – 04 JAN 16 – I FINALLY got the railing and posts up. What a goat rope. Now, I can complete the treads and finish the detailed touch-up work. 
I’ve also decided to concentrate on elevation – going up and down the retention pond area instead of hiking on flat surfaces. The pond is 30 steps down, 30 across and 30 up the other side. Turn around and repeat. I’m up to about 10 right now which is nowhere near enough. Still, it’s a start and will continue to grow.
Huh. Guess I can talk after all. 
Now for the nervous countdown to begin. Again.",,View Entry,"Jan 04, Mon",0
Old Hiker 2016,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521788,"Not as many entries this year for some reason - too much to do in the house, yard, etc.Pack explosion #?? . Again. Everything out – everything looked at – everything agonized over. 10 Band-Aids to 5 to 8 to 4 to……………. You get the idea.Everything. I'm still amazed at how much LESS gear I have this time over 2012. I'm hoping this will make a difference in distance traveled. Pack helps a lot - very well fitting, rides very well as I trudge along. Started packing food – have to stop every now and then. I’m putting “just one more” in, “just in case”. Need to stop packing my fears. Don’t need it, don’t want it. Packing 5.5 days of food in the pack, with my first food drop pretty much ready to mail to Mountain Crossing. Will mail tomorrow so it will get there before me, which is funny, as EVERYONE and EVERYTHING will get there before me. Trying to do food as light as possible for the first month or so. Training is pretty much over except for the little stair-stepper. Got up to 15 retention ponds before having to stop for a 60 pulse count (100 beats per minute) and then starting the 3 mile flat hike. Updating the equipment as well. The reviews are all initial type reviews. I’ll update as actual use occurs.",,View Entry,"Feb 25, Thu",0

Lunch before Stover Creek shelter. Pack is heavier than practicing but has added food and water. Riding well. Other hikers from hostel previous night: Rumpus, Natalie, 2 other guys and Bob AKA Trekker. Will only say he is ""over 81"" and wants to be the oldest thru-hiker to date.

Retention pond training this time helped a lot. Leapfrogged Chris several times. He planned on Gooch shelter. I walked on to roadbed. Met Ranger trainers at Gooch. Water buffalo was there like 2012. Senior NCO said we could take what we needed. He claims his MOM did the Trail on 2013. Sheesh. No pressure to finish now.  Started raining at roadbed. Should NOT have pushed but I dislike intensely camping in the gaps from 2012. Too much wind, much lower wind chills. 1st blister on 2nd left toe. Doesn't hurt, doesn't bother me except for pressure.

Called and got cabin to clean up and resupply with box at Mountain Crossings. Met No cares bear - ANOTHER SOBO hiker. Started last July and is trying to catch up with Dr Love. Stopped at Jarrod Gap for water. No wind, so took hour for hot meal and coffee. Started up towards Blood Mt about 1100. Met Heartsong at water source at base. From CT, but spent most of her life in FL and HI. Passed me a few minutes later.1/2 way up Blood, snowflakes. Awwwww, ain't this purty. 20 minutes later, heavier and more. Hmmm...... Wasn't the forecast for rain? Snow like meal, snow great deal. 15 minutes after that, heavy snow and blowing hard. Oh, my. Got to shelter at top about 1330. Met an older hiker (71) from earlier. Has trail name of Happy now. Heavy, heavy snow, 25+ mph winds blowing it hard. Started down ahead of Happy. Several hundred meters down, lost the Trail. Not good. Several false leads, followed footprints back to losing point. Seriously getting ready to bag it and go back up to camp overnight. Didn't want to be the idiot they had to rescue because of stupidity. Happy following MY footprints down. Talked, kept looking. Happy went down further than I did, turned around and found white blaze on wind swept rock. HUZZAH !!Finally got down. Lots of snow. 4+ inches at Neel Gap. Wind died off below, just lots of snow coming down. Picked up box, got cabin, took second day. Need day for snow to melt. Tons of hikers got caught and are taking second day. Going thru box, trying to dump gear. Nothing is non-critical at this point.

Got water at Cheese Factory site: Ms. White's class: first snake. Little ol' 24 inch garter snake I scared with my big boots. Slithered up under wall where water was coming from. Didn't care - I filter AND use iodine tablets to kill any germs. Pretty little thing. Tray Mt at 1630 - shelter crowded with young pups, so I stayed in the large flat area where blue blaze trail to shelter turns off of AT. Camped behind large - 36 inch - log to cut the wind.

Starting to dehydrate - watching closely. Kelly Knob VERY bad - 1.5 hours to get to top - only 1 mile, but over 1000 feet climb. Took a 15 somewhere in the middle. The other side only took me 30 minutes or so for the same elevation change. Go figure. At Vista with ""Cottonball"". Only other camper. NOT a good place - too many people have packed down the flat spots. Very bad night - hardly any sleep at all. Wind constant, but not as cold as last few nights. Pad totally inadequate for hard spots - no leaves to pile up, etc. for additional padding. Long, hard day again. 8.5 miles max.

Grabbed the last tent spot. Will try new pad to make sure it's leak free for now. Nice place - bit dis-organized, but with the influx of hikers this AM, I can see why. Stuff sent home - extra food (too much) gotten for a change in diet, Hardee's lunch, computer time. Rain not due until Friday, but it seems the percentages are dropping every time the weather is on. Life is good. Ms. White's class: The mountains are VERY steep - think going up 100 flights of stairs, then turning around and going back down. Then do it again 3 times. No footprints yet - just one little ol' garter snake. A few pretty dark blue birds and I heard an owl a couple of nights ago - very neat. Whoo-whooooooo, whoo-whoooooooo, whoooooooooooooooo.

Just like 2012 - sun burned, wind burned and frost bite. Took 45 hard minutes to get over Hump. Ground was frozen past noon which helped the walking. Lots of ridges from previous hikers for traction and no slush or mud to slip in. At Mt. Harbor by 1300!! I need to catch up on my lack of sleep the previous night and resupply. Splurged on a B&B room upstairs in the house. Was surprised at the fairly quick 9 miles to the hostel. Seemed much longer. Trail looks flatter to Damascus.

Second snake - 2 foot garter snake on the Trail. Refused to move until I poked it. Finally slithered up and off. Wild strawberries are blooming - 2 more months or so and maybe I can find some to eat. Do NOT remember the walk by the river here. Very nice, very pretty. Saw ""Slider"" at a road gap. Pulled muscle and has to get off. Had 11 miles by 1600. Leapfrogged Diesel and Cold Snap at the bench, swapped picture taking. Easy seeming Trail today. Not sure why. Maybe because of the great rest the previous night. Found GREAT camping spot - offered to Diesel and Cold Snap, but they were out of water and had to move on. Built small fire in existing fire ring to get rid of all the trash some idiots had left behind. Found CRKT knife - moving it forward for a while. Nice knife - someone has to be missing it.

It should be an optional blue blaze for those people who like that kind of stuff. Very strenuous, very steep, very long and the falls are not that great. Tons of stone steps down and up.

There are still NO leaves on the trees, other than the rhododendron and mt. laurel which are green year 'round and the conifers.

There was a box of Trail magic from a Baptist youth group around mile 447. the box is bright orange and has crosses torched out of the top. Inside were drinks, snacks and supplies. In 2012, the box was empty, but I sent a small donation and a letter of thanks. THIS time, I got an ice-cold Mountain Dew orange (my first ever), a bottle of water and a pastry.

Called Crazy Larry from the border - he stated he had a room for tonight, but couldn't reserve it for me.

Sawyer filter slow - need my pump back. Manassas Gap Shelter packed with tents and young pups - no one younger than about 25 - mostly new faces, but some I recognized and said ""Hi"" to. No one in shelter for some reason. No flat spots left, didn't want the shelter - no problem - there will be a flat spot just up the Trail. Ha. Hesitate to put this in but: as I was hiking out, heard one young pup ask who I was. Another female young pup I have leap-frogged a few times say, ""That's Old Hiker. He's nice. I like him."" Another male pup (Her partner? Not sure.) said, ""Yeah, he's pretty cool. He's going to make it."" Didn't realize people knew me or were rooting for me out here. Every flat spot had rocks underneath. Could NOT get stakes into the ground. Kept going - kept trying - nothing. Made Dick's Dome shelter at 2015 - I HATE doing that. Tents up and down the area between the old shelter and where the new one was being constructed. Sheesh. No one in the old shelter - I'm beat - in I go. Only one in shelter. 19 miles started the right ankle hurting - kept me awake, tossing and turning trying to find a position, ANY position where it would stop, but could not.

Old Hiker 2016,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545034,"Took a zero to go to the local clinic which DID take my Tricare insurance. 
I'd taken NO pain meds for the last day or so, just to see if anything was being masked. 
Now: nothing on the doctor, they have their protocol; however:
Question #1: Do you feel tired? 
Question #2: Do your joints ache?
C'mon - I'm hiking anywhere from 12-15 miles a day in the mountains - of course to the above!! 
Question #3: Do you have a rash? Uhhhhhh.............
Doctor took one look at the rash and said they weren't even going to do the blood test - Lyme disease. Temp was a classic low grade 99.8. After close questioning, she was not sure just how long I've had the disease, only that I have had it QUITE a while evidently. I never saw the tick that got me and I've been using 98% DEET since Virginia. 
3 weeks of Doxicillin should clear it up. Hoping so. This might explain the whining and complaining about my ailments for the last few weeks, I believe. Not excusing it, just explaining it. 
So, the pill schedule will interfere with my calorie intake, as the pills have to be taken on an empty stomach. 2 hours AFTER a meal (snack time) or 1 hour BEFORE a meal (snack time). Sheesh. It'll work out. Just glad I caught it. 
The hike to the local CVS was about a mile - very long for some reason and very painful. Ankles, shoulders, wrists, all pretty bad. Guess all the pain meds WERE masking the symptoms of the Lyme. Back to Fast Mac for more protein and another pickup by GMH. 
Pigeon Toe and Determined came in for the night, so I have some people I recognize.","1650.7

Blessing #3. Got to Zealand Hut at 1500 (!). Asked for work for stay and was granted it.

Up at 0600. 2 hikers were on the hut front porch who had been rained out with a poor choice of camping site. Claimed the water in their tent was coming up and over their sleeping pads. had ALL their gear spread out over the rails, floor and had strung lines to hang more. Croo girl came out and nicely asked him to pack up his stuff, as the guests would be coming out and needed to get by to the bathroom, steps, etc. Guy was VERY entitled: ""Just trying to dry it out"", ""why can't you help hikers"", ""can't get it packed very quickly"". Kept trying to have the last word and the young girl got hostile as well, giving him 5 minutes to pack up. I wanted to slap the punk kid. He kept mouthing to me about they needed to help the hikers and I told him the hut is for PAYING customers and they don't OWE hikers anything. He got pissed and shut up. While I was eating breakfast, told the girl it was the first time I'd seen the ""entitled hiker"" mentality and it was disgusting. Yeesh. Determined came by as I was waiting for work for stay. He lost one of his poles in the flooding creeks when he tried to toss them over to better cross. One hit a tree and disappeared down the creek. Told him I would try for phone coverage and make sure we were picked up at the Notch, as we were pretty sure we had told them Tuesday. He went forward.SOBO came over to talk - told her about Determined's pole and she said she had snagged it over by where she had been camping. She brought it over to me and eventually (2 hours or so), I caught up with Determined and gave it to him. He has new poles coming in to the hostel, but still needed two for some pretty wide creek crossings. Blessing #4: Shhhh! Don't tell anyone, but incredibly decent Trail. Someone really screwed up and put the Trail down an old railroad bed. Hardly any rocks, straight, no climbs, great! Made the 7.6 miles in a touch over 4 hours. THIS is what the Trail should have been the last 3 days. Blessing #5: Determined got to the highway at 1400. I had NO cell service, so we tried to hitch in to the AMC center where we could get coverage. 2 guys from India or Pakistan picked us up within 20 minutes. Picture it: Me as the Charley Manson look-alike contest winner and another older, scruffy looking hiker (sorry, Determined, but you know it's true! ) and we were picked up by two local, clean, neat businessmen. Wow. Would not take any money. Really cool. Called the hostel - they would get us at 1845 instead of 1800 as they were running late. No prob - we had lunch, sat down in the front lobby, charged phones, did texting, took short naps, whatever. I got a fuel canister for MUCH cheaper than a normal outfitter, so that worked. Shuttle got us into Lancaster by 1945 or so. Too late to resupply for tomorrow, so have to take zero day. No probs - weather the next 4 days is supposed to be optimal for the Presidential traverse from Madison to Washington. Hope it's true. Washington had 90+ gusts with 70+ mph the previous night, with rain. NOT great hiking weather. It will take me at least 3 days to get up and over. Other hikers at the hostel allayed my fears even more, saying it was NOT as bad as what we had gone through before. Crow from earlier has decided to yellow-blaze up to Gorham - means he is skipping the Whites entirely, as he can't get up and over them too well. He's worried about injuries and not finishing at all. I told him he could always come back and section the Whites or slack pack them. Truly sorry to see him go, but may catch up later on. Hostel is run by the 12 Tribes - a religious sect who operates them up and down the Trail, but no trying to convert you. Everything an a suggested donation basis, but no prob if you can't pay, evidently.Hostel is non-alcohol, so my birthday shot of bourbon will have to wait until the summit of Mt. Washington.

Again, problem is pretty much NO places to drop and camp,so I have to stop. Not sure how much more I could have gone, I'm pretty beat. Made the Nauman campsite by 1530. Over 7.5 hours to go the 6+ miles. Got a platform, but not really happy about it. A tent platform is just what it sounds like: 2x6x in a square up off the ground. It is flat, it is level, but it's pretty hard on my knees in the mornings. My SoLong 6 needs stakes in the ground to hold it up - NOT a freestanding tent. The eye bolts and nails around the perimeter of the platform helped, but not an optimal setup. I like to LOOK like I know what I'm doing and when my tent is not set up to my satisfaction, I don't like it.","1843.7

I did so - Nauman, then Lakes of the Clouds (LOC) dungeon (more later), then Madison hut or Valley Way campsite. Got to LOC at or about 1130. It had taken me over 4 hours to get this 4.6 miles. I asked the hut czar about getting a bunk in the dungeon and she flat told me that ""It was a nice day and you can make Madison. You made it here in about the ""book time"". The dungeon is for all the later hikers."" or words to that effect. Evidently, they have an average time between shelters and the next shelter was ""only"" 4.5 hours away. The dungeon is a 12x12 basement room with 6 bunks in 2 tiers of 3. Very small. When the hut is not operating, it is an emergency shelter. Plywood bunks, concrete floor, steel door. I knew my capabilities. I looked at what was ahead and KNEW I would NOT make the next hut or campsite before dark. Relayed this to the czar, no effect. Age - no effect. Leg probs - no effect. Asked for and got her supervisor's number. Supervisor and I had a pretty long talk - he thought I had medical problems that prevented me from walking further, but I told him, No, it was just capabilities and I didn't want to be the guy they had to rescue at night. Upshot - he called the czar and I got a dungeon bunk. Stayed there the rest of the day to keep out of the way of the hut personnel since I was now the face of the entitled thru hiker. So sorry - just following what you said. Now - dungeon did fill up, as did the upstairs with hikers who thought they could just walk in to get space inside. They were given the space, evidently with no questions asked. Here's the rub for me: the dope smokers tried to crowd into the dungeon to CONTINUE their weed smoking when the fog and rain started. I flat out told them take it outside, as I was allergic to smoke somewhat. They were nice enough to do so; however, THESE are the people who smoke weed until 2300 at night, stay in bed until 1000 the NEXT morning and show up at the NEXT hut in time for work for stay and GET IT. Yeah, I'm somewhat bitter about planning, trying to make time and getting grief about it. Maybe I am entitled - don't care. Got a bunk. Oh, yeah. Fog and rain started.

Wearing rain suit and still didn't sweat much going up. Very rough, rocky Trail going up. Made Mt.

Got a squished penny as well, a penny that's squished into an ellipse with ""I climbed Mt. Washington"" on it. Determined came up as I was leaving. He decided to check the snack bar out as well. Pictures at the summit pile of rocks, a bit of confusion over which way to go and then down the other side. Still foggy, but lifting every now and then to about 100 meters or so, then closing back down. Heard the cog train twice - both times the fog closed in and I could NOT see if from 50 feet away OR take a picture. Got lost at the first Trail intersection. Guide says another trail to the EAST - this one was to the WEST. Went down both, found a VERY faded white blaze on the back of a boulder on one, but still waited for another opinion from some other hikers. Noticed that the AT cairns usually have a white piece of quartz on the top for a blaze. Made Madison hut by 1530 - little early for work for stay according to the hut czar - no prob. She was very nice. Got a bowl of soup for a snack and while I was eating it, 3 young pups come in and hand the czar a note from Lakes of the Clouds. She opens it, looks directly at me and smiles........hmmmmm. Never mind - decision was already made to go to Valley Way campsite. VW was down a VERY steep, rock, slick path. Would have been very dicey the previous night. Got a tent site (dirt pad) and set up about 1630. From 1700 on, people kept coming in. By 2100, the site was full, yet people were still trooping by.

OK, I'm still happy to zero. It's raining pretty hard this morning, and MAY, repeat, MAY quit by by this afternoon or linger into tomorrow.","2037.9

Noticed my left shin is yellow from bruises caused by all the hits and abrasions I've been experiencing. Right shin not as bad for some reason. Left leg/ankle still not all in, even after 2.5 days off. Found flat space right by the Trail, finally. Piled rocks and logs on the Trail side of the tent in case someone tried to night hike by. Didn't want them to kick my guy line. By 1710. it's already dark under the trees. Finished camp and supper by headlamp, which I hate. Absolutely NO clue where I am - just guessing. May be more, may be less than 14. Went past the powerline, but haven't made the next shelter, so who knows?Ashes went past, but he has a hammock, so he can camp pretty much anywhere.","2037.9

I now have a cold I picked up at Sterling Inn, probably from some piece of hiker trash. Oh, like me. Not too bad yet, just enough to take the edge off my well-being. Moxie Bald Mt not too bad - past the shelter the Trail was pretty good. Mostly nice, few rock hops, but good. Flat, easy. Still only 13.6 in 9 hours - feet and legs can't give any more for some reason. Just worn out, probably. Came up on 3 Walker hounds with brightly colored collars and radio or GPS collars. Except for the color (black with brown spots), they looked exactly like my Walker hound at home. One was barking at me, so I shooed them back south. Later, I heard panting behind me and they were following me north. No barking this time, so I let them go by. Hope they find their owner. Made Horseshoe Canyon shelter by 1645. Now set up for Monson. ** I am typing this in on 08 Oct. I can't remember where I camped here, but I know I did NOT use the shelter. **","2052

Private cabins, bunk house, very clean and neat, yet primitive and off-grid. Came to a Trail intersection - could not decide if it was the right place or not. Had to call - Nope - keep going.

On other side of Fourth Mt (that's the name) somewhere. Planning to summit on 04 Oct as all weekends through November at the campground are sold out. No reason to rush. Can't anyway. Got cold as I was setting up camp - thermals, dry sox and hat tonight. Started 2 hand warmers by mistake - first one seemed dead, so I started another.

Heard moose calling all last night, in addition to some idiot with a boat horn on his vehicle. I could hear vehicles crunching down the gravel road and the boat horn sounded like it was just up the Trail it was so loud. Got my food drop - now I have way too much food, but I'm not dumping anything just yet. Killed 3 mice INSIDE the bear box. They had just set up shop, shredding a roll of toilet paper. I have a few nibbles on my plastic bag, but nothing eaten. Got a couple of drinks and snacks, moved on. Texted Mr. Pepin about mice - he had a good laugh at how I texted him. Not HIS fault mice are there. Got to White House Landing by 1515. Great Trail up to them. Nice people, primitive, off grid set-up, but really neat. Got a room and a shower. No laundry, which is icky, but a hot shower helped. Great supper as well. WHL was a place that had closed for 2 years.

Met a ""Trail Steward"" - Long John who checked on my rez with his radio. Nope - didn't go through. He had a deal for me being the 4th in a 4 person shelter, but I wanted my own space.

Easy for a mile or so - then turned very tough, including hand over hand climbs over some of it. Met Bamm-bamm coming down. Passed by no one. No one up there, according to him. Fog started at the end of the Tablelands below the summit. Could not see the summit until about 40 feet away. VERY windy, VERY cold from Tablelands up to summit. Hands started to get numb, so I broke out a hand warmer, which helped. Yes, I didn't take my gloves. Idiot.Tablelands are the flattish areas between the peak and the last rock climb cliffs. Sorta flat, you rock hop a bit, but it's pretty smooth. Sign came into view through the fog - got there, touched it and started crying. Sat down and could not believe I was almost done. Don't forget - climb up, climb down. No one there to see, no one there to take my picture. Drat. Poop Hands and another young pup came up AFTER I was under control and the obligatory pictures started. The fog began to break up and we had amazing views past the sign. Stayed less than 30 minutes - had to meet 1600 shuttle. Took me 4 hours to get up. Now, the hard part of getting down. Met a TON of people coming up. Turned around, peak is clear from 1.5 miles away - you can see the sign and cairn beautifully. The fog was starting to roll over the edge of the Tablelands. it would curl up and over and dissipate. Really cool looking. Going down the cliff climbs, met Calamity Jane from England, who went past me while I was taking a break. She had asked her Trail buddies to help her down, but they pretty much deserted her. She was not in a good mood and was emotional about it. I stayed and we started down together. 100 meters down, I realized I had left my jacket liner and had to go back. Pretty sure Jane thought I was deserting her as well. Scrambled back up, got the liner and caught back up. Made a joke about how she had been dumped by the Americans TWICE in one day. Bloody yanks, you just can't trust 'em. Helped her (psychologically) down by taking her poles as needed when she had to climb or slide down. Helped her and I was glad I had been there. Started listening to my epic music, Jane wanted rock, so she picked some stuff out and we pretty much flew down the rest of the mt. Went a LOT faster than I would have, probably.
