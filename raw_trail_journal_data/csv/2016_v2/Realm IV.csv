Realm IV,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/400322,"Hiking the AT has been on my ""bucket list"" for many years, but time and opportunity were not afforded me in the strong early years of my life. Now that my five children are grown and I've reached the ""senior discount"" age at many restaurants, it's now or never time. My son-in-law, a sports medicine professor (great to have him along), will be undergoing the journey with me. Our plans are to do a month on the AT each spring for the next three years, with the possibility of continuing to Katadin without my son-in-law to finish the hike should the opportunity and peak health prevail.I have been training off and on since last fall, doing short day hikes and some weight and cardio training. Getting back into 10+ mile a day hiking shape at the age of 57 has it's challenges. I have been through 4 foot and leg injuries since I began training, but I assume this is all apart of the process necessary to prepare for the real hike without injury, so I have never doubted our departure date which will begin Monday after Mother's day. I've had plenty of time to obtain most of the gear I'll need. I had hoped to come in at 30 lbs, totally packed with food and water, but currently my pack weight is coming in at 35 lbs with five days of food supply. I'm 5 lbs into a 20 lb body weight loss to compensate for some of the pack weight.I've done a couple of 25 mile weekend hikes, but developed a sore and stiff knee on one of those. So I'm gradually working the mileage back up with knee braces, now doing three 6 mile days per weekend that I will increase until I'm back up to three consecutive 10 mile days.I have to express my gratefulness to the trail journal community and all the information available from so many websites. The experience and advice of others has been incredibly valuable in all aspects of preparation for this hike.We don't have trail names yet, but will update when we do. My wife is a little apprehensive about the magnitude of this undertaking. When she questioned my doctor about the hike, his only response was, ""I'm only sorry that I'm not going with him!"" I realize my best friend on the trail will be Vitamin I. Everything in my heart and mind is ready to go. Providng my body agrees, we expect this experience to enhance my already quality of life. As they say, you're either busy living or your busy dying. I choose life!","

Realm IV,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/400939,"With just over a couple of months before beginning our section hike from Springer, I am in the process of testing out newly purchased gear and trying to get the hiker legs in shape. After a recent 25 mile weekend, I was experiencing knee pain, so I've introduced some daily stretching and muscle exercises recommended for combating knee pain. For the first time in four weeks, the knee is feeling much better and plans are to resume a full schedule of trial hikes on back to back days to test the stamina of the knees. As a 57 year old, I'll be cautionary and employ the use of compression knee braces on both knees when tackling the AT.    I've really enjoyed reading Thru-Hikers journal entries for the 2013 season. My gear was purchased for the warmer climate months. I have to admit my admiration for those weathering out the extremely cold start to a mid-February hike from GA.    I'll be using a Hennesey Hammock for the warmer May - June nights, providing the nights are storm free most of the time. Even a month of section hiking will provide all of the weather variety we expect to encounter on the AT. I wish I could hike the entire trail as a thru-hike, but responsibilities and grandchildren share my hiking dreams.        I suppose I get the same responses from friends and family that all AT section and thru hikers get - ""You're going to do what?""/ ""Why would you want to do that?""/ ""You're going to sleep in the woods and carry everything you need on your back?""/ ""I'm glad it's you and not me!""    Sometimes you get the idea that only hikers understand hikers. It's pretty much impossible to instill passion into another who does not already share that same passion. And so, excluding some casual conversation when I am asked, I have accepted the fact that this is a journey for me to enjoy rather than a journey to be appreciated and shared with others. For 6 months I have shared the excitement of this great adventure, hoping to stir in another their adventurous spirit. A few have been moved to visit their own personal ""bucket lists."" But most, when faced with the possibility of the resurrection of their dreams, will choose to let those dreams lie dormant.    Life is too short and sacred not to experience its abundance. Potential and possibilities are too rewarding not to accept the challenges with a ""do or die"" spirit. And so, with two months to go, it's time to focus on the inward strength for the journey. It's time for the mental and spiritual preparation required. It's time to journey away from some things and toward the lessons of life that the AT has to share.    For the past 6 months I have gathered gear and studied guides and learned from former hikers. I will take my first step in GA mid May. But my AT jouney begins now from a more introspective viewpoint. I am down 7 lbs from my intended 24 lb weight loss for starting the trail. I begin the day and end the day with focused preparation. Although I'll spend just 30 days on the trail, I begin my three month journey today.Busy Living,Mike Criner","

Realm IV,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/401035,"Sunday is always a great day to be thankful. Blessings are everywhere we look, if we choose to look and expect. I'm expecting for great blessings on the AT, but the preparation has blessings of its own.    Today was a test drive for the rested knee. Empathizing with those out on the trail during another cold front in GA and NC, I ventured out in 29 degree weather to do an afternoon of hiking. After 6 miles of up and down rocky terrain, the knee has stood the test. That's a great sign of things to come.    Plans are now forming for an overnight shakedown when weather warms a little. My son-in-law and I are both using Hennesey Hammocks, so warmer weather will be a welcome sight.    With all major gear purchased and received, my attention turns to the miscellaneous checklist and low weight alternatives. I also need to begin breaking in my new Asolo hiking boots.    I root on all thru hikers who will be at least half completed with their thru hikes when I start on my section hike mid-May. My son-in-law will not be free of his teaching responsibilities until then, and I have a 1 month sabbatical from my work as a Pastor. Otherwise, we would be out on the trail much earlier.    Today I thank the Lord for my encounter with His created nature. The hike was highlighted with a deer sighting, squirrels, geese, heron, woodpeckers, along with a pre-At hike of Gorp and Banana chips.    71 days until Springer MT.Bald Eagle","

Realm IV,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/401815,"Just two months away and concerns about the knee are subsiding. This weekend included a leisurely Friday stroll, an intense 3 hour climb up and down the East and West Pinnacles in Berea, KY on Saturday, and a 6 mile hike at Clifton Gorge in Clifton, OH on Sunday with my daughter, DeAnna.    Fine tuning the gear and reducing body weight are top priorities in the last two month's preparation for our one month section hike. I have achieved 1/3 of the weight loss I need. I will now begin laying out my gear in a spare room and checking off from my gear list items already obtained. Like most hikers-to-be, I have gleaned my listings for gear items and sample breakfast, lunch and supper menus from previous hikers. Prioritizing essential gear will help keep backpack weight to a necessary minimum.    I am enjoying reading other hiker's journals, especially those who provide details concerning favorite resupply locations, AYCE (All you can eat restaraunts) in towns and favorite hostels. Also helpful in making notes are hiker's details of the most difficult hiking areas as well as the easier recovery miles.    Hiking for just one month, our (my son-in-law and myself) plans are to limit our resupplies and town experiences and experience the best of the great outdoors by staying on the trail. We are planning to resupply about every 5 days by going into towns early in the morning and returning for an afternoon hike. This is the best way to avoid the extra costs that come with overnight stays in towns. Our desire is to take any zero days (no hiking) or nero days (near zero hiking miles) at or near a great view sight on the trail.    The next couple of months will fly by. I have a new 3 week old grandson to vist and another grandaughter expected to arrive in early May just before the hike. Most weekends will be spent combining visits and hikes as miles and backpacking weight is increased. The goal is a 10-10-10 (ten miles each day) with a 35 lb loaded backpack weekend by tax-filing date. Then maybe I will be able to outrun the IRS!!!!!    Many thanks to all the encouraging words from my four daughters and son. Maybe I'll have the privilege of experiencing a week or so with some of them on the trail in following year's hikes.Making Decisions Today for Tomorrow's JourneyBald Eagle","

Realm IV,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/407135,"With one month remaining until a section hike begins in Springer, GA, random training must now become more focused for this 57 year old man. To help with the conditioning, a local fitness company has provided me with a 30 day free membership. The only thing that I'm told is effective in training for a hike is hiking. So, most of my training, muscular and cardio, will be on an inclined treadmill when not out on the actual practice trails.    So, yesterday was a 7 mile effort, followed by a wakeup call in the middle of the night with a cramping calf muscle. Determined I was back on the treadmill today. Better that I work out all the bugs now than on the trail. I continue to fight some right inside knee pain that has been ongoing for 6 weeks now, but am determined that this will not stop me either.   I'm not happy with my pack weight at this time. With a five day supply of food, I'm between 35 - 38 lbs. Hopefully I can trim at least 5 lbs off the starting weight. One of my goals is to eliminate 24 lbs of body weight before I take my first step on the AT. I'm delighted to report that, with one month remaining, I've shed 17 of those lbs.   I was originally envious of all those already able to be out on the trail in February and March - but, after following their treacherous wintery experiences, I'm feeling a little more fortunate to have my starting date in May (perhaps I'll experience the other end of the spectrum - intensive heat and dehydration!)   Last night I was asked the question everyone is asked, ""Now, why do you want to do this?"" My reply - ""Modern society, city living, civilization, clouds and veils the real created world. I'd like to spend some time away from what man has created and experience a purer surrounding of God's design. I want to experience living with what little you can carry on your back, free for a moment to live in a spontaneous world which allows you to adapt to weather conditions, wildlife, immediate physical needs - all the while knowing that a loving Creator has painted the landscape and has a watchful eye upon us, hoping we won't miss a moment of it.   Everyone hikes their own hike. Some mix the trail with hostels, hotels, restaurants, and the such. Others enjoy the community life of meeting and hiking with a new family on the trail. I expect my journey to be quite introspective, listening to my body for the length of each day's hike, listening to my soul for the connection I seek with my Creator, and letting the journey of the AT trail give me a clearer sense of the things that are worthy of our earthly days.   Life is an exciting journey. In just 30 days, the AT will become an actual part of that journey. I will take that expectation with me with every trip to the gym and every practice hike until then.Busy Livin'Bald Eagle","

Realm IV,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/412448,"Crunch time is here for final preparations for our section hike. We take our first of many steps on the trail in just one week. The backpack has been packed and unpacked and packed three times in an attempt to get the weight in the 35 lb range. While it's too late to make any major changes now, I'll definitely work at lowering the weight in future years as we attempt to hike the entire AT over the next 5 to 6 years in one month segments.    I also get the privilege of starting the trail as a new grandpa. My third daughter is scheduled to deliver on the 10th of May, just two days before the journey to Springer, GA. I'll be both anxious to greet my new granddaughter, Annabelle, and to complete the first section hike through Georgia, North Carolina and the Smokies so that I hurry home to tell her all about it.    Tomorrow I make a last trip to the doctor to have a look at my knee to see if I'm a candidate for a cortizone shot, or whether we go with this old ""as is"" body. I've mentioned in other preparation journals that I've been experiencing some knee pain in my training. Regardless of the diagnosis, the intent is still to let the majesty and miraculousness of God see me through. I'll update this journal with results before beginning the actual hike.    I have committed the ultimate sacrifice by eliminatiung two of my snicker bars to help with pack weight. Actually, I might make those my celebrative snack just before starting the approach trail to Springer.     Getting away for even a month is taking a great deal of planning. I have multiple lists of final things to do to cover everything at home and work while I'm away. The planning is a stark reminder of how many things our lives are tied to. Hopefully the experience of the trail will be a life changing experience which affects the many unimportant things we attach our lives to. Doing that which is important, but not at the time urgent, is crucial to long term health and quality of life - easy to say, but hard to do!!    I just read the news that we may be joined by billions of locusts on the trail. Let's hope not!! There are much more soothing and calming sounds to go to sleep by than the deafening sound of the every 17 year menace.    Time to repack the backpack and weigh it again.

Realm IV,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/412826,"Just 4 days away from leaving the city, traffic, and my Sleep Comfort bed for the serenity, heart pounding, knee jarring, starvation experience of a lifetime!!! What kind of crazy person would choose to inflict pain toward their body in order to expand their understanding of the hidden joys of life. I suppose it goes without saying that the price paid is directly proportionate to the effecttive quality of change that occurs in ones life.    We all live in light of our deepest desires. Our thoughts, our passions, our actions are all true indicators of the heart's direction. We may speak one way and live another. Reality is that actions speak (not more than words) but in spite of words.     This last week before the hike has brought some internal searching for me. For the past nine months, I have lived, trained and anticipated the hike with a childhood eagerness. Yet, for the last few days, I have finally had to deal with the emotions of leaving family, relinquishing responsibility, and beginning the quarantine of having little to no control of what happens at home. I suppose I can thank my parents a lot for that. Both Dad and Mom were and are dependable and consistent in everything they do. They were consistent in their parenting, consistent in their support, consistent in their responsibilities to provide, consistent in their faith and consistent in their love. And now I leave on Mother's Day and return on Father's Day, remembering and honoring them while absent, myself, from spouse, children and grandchildren. Yet I believe the price paid on the AT will bring me back a stronger husband, father and grandfather.    How does the hike fit in with my desires? Is it an attempt to declutter, simplify, zero in on solitude, community and personal direction? Is it a realization that everything the world has to offer is shifting sand, and therefore, a search for that which is lasting and solid? I must admit that I have no expectations other than what God reveals to me as I plant one foot in front of the other. My greatest preparation is to be acutely aware of the still small voice of God, to catch glimpses of truth with wide opened eyes, and to have a spiritual awakening that enables me better to apply myself to the real art of abundant living.    For years I have read and bought into the philosophy that one's past does not dictate one's future. And yet, in the study of human nature, including my own, I see patterns of behavior and thinking which fully reflects the choices of yesterday. This is one of the biggest lies to be embraced by people, for our past does, indeed, dictate our future. How does one then change their future if they are dissatisfied with today's results? Simply, we must intentionally choose to create a new past that will, then, dictate a newly chosen future. Perhaps this hike is an attempt to create a new past in some areas of my life. In reading other's journals, that seems to be a central thread of their experiences - at least for those who are on an inward journey as well as a physical hike.    I suppose this blog is an indicator of the reflective mood I currently find myself in. While I've prepared my body for several months for the trail's challenges, these few words are the mental and spiritual cleansing needed to now move forward. Tomorrow will engage both body and soul in a ""full steam ahead"" journey. In fact, why wait till tomorrow. It's time to go through the backpack again and shave off a few ounces, time to re-organize last minute tasks to do, time to re-test gear and make last minute preparations, time to begin a new future.    In response to my last post, the knee has been examined and diagnosed to be tendonitis. As I write this post, I am icing it and taking Naproxen for inflammation. It's good to know that the structure of the knee is good and all I need to do is manage the pain on the trail. That in itself gives me a sense of community since everyone on the trail shares in managing pain and soreness as in integral part of the hiking experience.     Chose Your Past, Create your Future,Bald Eagle","

We arrived at Amacolia Falls State Park to do the 8.8 approach trail to Springer mountain on Monday morning, May 13th. The approach trail begins with a series of 630 climbing steps up the water fall with fantatstic views. We (my son-in-law and I) immediately recognized that we were in for more than we expected. It is said that the Appalachian Trail is heart pounding on the way up and knee busting on the descents, and that is an understatement.     We completed 11.6 miles all the way up on top of Springer Mountain and then down to Stover Creek Shelter where we hund our hammocks for the night in a beautiful thicket of Rhododendron trees within 10 feet of a brisk stream. It was soothing to listen to the stream, but the weather dropped to 37 degrees that night, having us spend half the night shivering, even though we had about three layers of clothing on.

Realm IV,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/415741,"Today we bit off a little more than we were prepared for. We covered 13 miles of steep up and down terrain going over both Sassafras and Justus Mountains. On one of the descents my good knee developed a sharp pain on the outside and I found myself having to step sideways down the descents to keep from aggravating the injury. I was now wearing knee braces on both knees wandering whether my joints would hold up to this kind of punishment. Blisters began to appear, which are expected for all continuous hikers in some degree or another, despite all the trining and preparation. What I have quickly discovered is that there is no adequate preparation for this hike other than actually hiking the AT. This is simply a grueling experience for young and old (me) alike.    We've been doing our best to find good sources of water and filter as much as we can, but sometimes thirst overcomes common sense. At the top of sassafras Mountain, we discovered a gallon jug with the top cut off of it, catching drops of water from a rock face cliff. Both of us drank about 8 ounces of the water, which was readily available to any animal living in the area. After apologizing to the Lord for our stupidity and asking for forgiveness and protection from our poor choice, we are happy to report no side ill affects to date.      We again hammocked at Gooch Shelter and had a much more pleasant night with temperatures dropping only to about 55 degrees. Too many miles for us, though left me both tired and with a loss of appetite. I tried to eat a peanut butter/ pita sandwich, but it just stuck to the roof of my mouth as if I had no salive whatsoever.

Blood Mountain was so named because of the tremendous loss of life between the Cherokee and Creek indians.

I am happy to report that, miraculously, both of my knees are almost pain free at this time, and we're excited to get to Neels Gap, which has a hostel (bunk beds) and a shower facility.

I stepped on the weight scales they had there to discover that I had lost 7 pounds in the first three days of hiking - and still my appetite had not returned. Possibly because of shear heat exhaustion or physical exhaustion, every bite of food was a forced action.    One of the great things along the trail are hiker boxes, where hikers unload unwanted or heavier items they no longer want to carry. We picked up enough food supplies here from the hiker box to take care of us for the next three days.    We were planning a zero day here, where you rest up a day to build up some strength to continue, but there had been bear activity here for the last few nights, so our camping plans were curtailed and we had to press on.     Happy to have the first shower, do our first laundry, have my first diet coke on the trail and even a ham sandwich, and disgard some hiker items and picke up a few things we needed.","Lance Creek

Alfonso and his wife and 8 year old daughter were from Houston, TX and were section hiking the AT. In a conversation with Alfonso, we quickly found out that we were both Christians and that God had used Alfonso in tremendous ways on the trail in previous hikes to minister to hikers. He said he would pray that God would use me as well to be a blessing. Already one of the hikers we have come to know has discontinued the use of my trail name and is now calling me ""Pastor"". At Muskrat Shelter we met up with three men, one 78 years old, another in his late 60's to early 70's and another in his 50's who were all Christians. We would hike with them the next day as well and share some interesting stories, including our faith in Christ.    After resting in Hiawassee, we had fresh legs and fresh feet.

It's amazing how some of the root structures of these trees grow in this rocky environment. We then had a tough climb to the summit of Courthouse Bald before making our way to Muskrat Shelter. I had planned on sleeping in the shelter this night, but the register read that their was a mouse infestation their so I opted to hammock it.

Powdered milk is a staple for breakfast and supper here on the AT. The highlight of today was the great view at Standing Indian Mountain. With more gradual ups and downs (1000 feet up and 1000 feet down), we made great time and completed the 12.5 miles in just over 8 hours, including lunch and breaks. On the trail you have breakfast, second breakfast at 10am, lunch, second lunch at 2pm and snacks in between before arriving at camp and fixing supper. then you hang your food from the reach of bears around 7pm and fast until 7am the next morning!!!    We had a great time with the three gentlemen around a campfire as temperatures plummeted again tonight, with expected lows around 37 degrees. The 78 year old gentlemen shared of how he had a bicycle accident and drove a pen into his chest, which was more painful to have removed than his recent ""pig valve"" heart surgery. And all he was doing was hiking in these mountains for 6 days. The other older gentlemen had fallen out of a shelter last fall and broken his arm, but continued to hike through the mountains with an Ace bandage wrapped around his arm. We heard stories of bears, wild boars, coal mines and much more, and then retired to our hammocks to weather out the cold night, wearing three shirts, a jacket, two pair of pants, a pairof shorts and tow pair of socks.Mike criner","Muskrat creek Shelter

We had to find foot holds as we scaled the half mile of rock to reach the 5000 foot altitude that provided about a 70-80 mile view it seemed. it was a beautiful day for seeing the Appalachian mountains from a 360 degree perspective from the Fire Tower on top of Mt Albert.    Having Mt Albert completed, we focused on getting to Rock Gap Shelter and arrived just before 5PM, having plenty of time to set up camp. The camping area was very limited there and we had it all to ourselves until after dark, when four other hikers came in with headlamps on. I had sat my hammock up right over the blue blaze trail entrance, so the hikers had to go under my ropes with me in the hammock. One of them had a dog with them which lessened the threat of any bear activity that night. It was another cold night, but only down to 40 degrees after the 37 degree night before.    We awoke to the usual birds singing. Going up Mt Albert we had heard an eagle or hawk make swift ending to some prey, screams of distress that are a little eerie out in the woods.

Realm IV,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/419146,"After a zero day at the Fontana Hilton Shelter ( and watching it pour rain for most of the day), we headed into the Smoky Mountains for what was expected to be a long arduous climb. At the Southern tip of the Smoky Mountains, you are at an elevation of just 1700 feet. Over the next 7 miles, you climb to 4500 on Doe Knob, and then on to 5000 feet by the time you reach Spence Field Shelter. The climb was not as steep or as difficult as many of the climbs in GA and NC, but it definitely was long. But after a zero day, with fresh legs, we were able to hike our longest day so far, at 16.7 miles.
The Shuckstack fire tower view is one of the popular stops in the Smoky Mountains, but a heavy fog obscured our view for the day, as is often the case in the Smoky Mountains.
Today brought the most memorable moment of the hike thus far. I was looking for a place to stop for a second breakfast (hikers on the AT eat two breakfasts, lunch, a second lunch on long days, and a supper before hanging their food bags on bear cables or in trees). At Birch Spring Gap, there was a place on the trail where a large tree had fallen across the trail and volunteers had chainsawed the width of the trail from the middle of the tree. I walked through the opening and then stopped to look at my AT guide for my location. I heard a noise in the leaves just to my left, and looked down to see a large rattle snake just 12 inches from my left foot. We both moved in opposite directions at the same time, and he quickly coiled into a striking position and began to rattle. I was a bit rattled myself, but it happened to quick to exact a great deal of fear. My adrenaline took a nice jump for the remainder of the day's hike, though. As you can see by the picture attached, it was a rather large rattle snake. I remained there for about 20 minutes to warn my partner and another hiker who were behind me on the trail. We have now had three bear encounters, three large snake sightings, several deer in camps and along the trail, owls, mice, hawks, and other things unseen at night that stir the leaves while we rest in our hammocks. This has become an adventure far exceeding our expectations.

Realm IV,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/419150,"Today was by far the most difficult hike of the Smoky Mountains, climbing Rocky Top and Thunderhead Mountains and the constant PUDS (pointless ups and downs). Water sources are much more scarce in the Smoky Mountains than in GA and NC, so we have to carry a little more weight in water between resupplies. The water sources are also a little more unreliable as to contamination from wildlife, so we have to filter most of our sources. We use a Steri-pen, which is an ultra-violet light source that claims to kill 99.999% of giardia producing microorganisms. We have been filtering about 30-40% of our water sources, but have found many sources through GA and NC coming directly out of the sides of mountains and have elected to save battery life of the Steri-pen if the water source looked clear and uncontaminated. I realise this is a little risky and perhaps irresponsible, but past hikers have shared the same track record. Some hikers treat all water sources. In talking with a ""ridge runner"" (forest rangers that patrol the AT), they say that most cases of Giardia come from the privys or contact with other hikers who do not use proper hand sanitization. So, despite the fact that their is a lot of social interaction with other hikers on the AT, you steer clear of hand shakes, sharing left over food or eating utensils, and takle proper care to snaitize your hands often, especially after trips to the Privy at shelters.    At Double Springs Shelter we met up with another of many families who we would spend a few evenings with. We have met several people along the way who will forever be a part of our hiking experience - Slow Rollin' - Hot Shot - people from all over the world - and now a father/mother/daughter combination out to hike the entire AT trail.    Each evening you have a couple of hours to cook supper and share your lives with other hikers and quickly connect with people sharing your love for the outdoors, for family and for God. In the Smoky Mountains, in order to more protect the environment, you are required to sleep in the shelter houses if there is room. Shelter houses sleep between 12 and 16. Each person gets about 30 inches width and 6 feet in length to sleep. Backpacks are hung on nails in the shelters, and food bags are hung on bear cables. It's amazing how amicable stinky people are with each other, always making room for another cold, wet and tired hiker.    It was a great evening of sharing with our new friends, who had set an agenda to hike through the Smoky mountains at just about our same pace. They were also great people of faith, and their daughter (trail name Cricket - because she ate a cricket!) was preparing for a future life of music ministry and would be going to Anchorage, Alaska after completing the trail.    Amazingly for us, we had completed 30 miles in our first two days in the Smoky Mountains, jsut a few weeks after saying we were going to back off to just 8-10 miles a day.Coming down the Home Stretch,Mike Criner","Spence Field Shelter

Clingman's Dome is the highest elevation on the entire 2180 miles of the AT at a height of over 6500 feet. Just before we arrived there was a momma bear and two cubs hanging around the tower.    That morning our new family friends were arranging to have a daughter who lived in the vicinity to bring them a food resupply for the remainder of their journey through the Smokies. They were also placing their order for Subway sandwiches, which we joking said they should'nt do within our hearing. They offered to order us subs as well, but we wanted to cover some extra miles that day and were afraid of being held up at their resupply point. They said they would surprise us with something. The father was experiecing some knee issues and they were going to skip (get a ride around) the descent after Clingman's Dome.    Occasionally you come to a place on the trail where tourists are encountered (parking areas to popular trail or mountain view sights). Amazingly, hikers are sometimes seen as somewhat of celebrities in this area. People are definitely curious about your journey, despite your smell or appearance. Matt and I have been asked several times to pose for pictures from complete strangers. We've been asked how many miles we've hiked, what we eat, have we seen any bears, etc...do we live with just what we have in our backpacks - one lady said her makeup would'nt fit into one of our backpacks. Occassionally we felt like we were kind of a zoo attraction as people were as interested in us as they might be a bear or some other unexpected sight.    We arrived at Icewater Springs Shelter to again greet our new friends who had bypassed about 8 miles of the trail that day, only to find out that Cricket had carried two Red Velvet home made cupcakes from her sister for several miles just for us. Wow - creme icing and cake had never tasted so good. What a special family to meet toward the end of our journey!! Trail magic once again!    It was a full house in the shelter, and at 6000 feet it was another night in the 40's. This has been an exceptionally cold hiking season - even in late May and June we have had three nights in the 30's and several nights in the 40's. The rule is that each 1000 feet in elevation produces a temperature drop of 3 degrees. So, at 6000 feet temperatues are 18 degrees colder than at sea level.    Matt has grown tired of the instant potatoe and tuna meals for supper, so we have switched to noodles or rice, especially anything that has a spicey, peppery flavor. Coming up with tasty, filling meals that are also very lightweight to carry is rather limiting, especially with the need to carry more weight in water with possible water sources usually about 6-8 miles apart in the Smoky Mountains.    We've now decided that we will conclude our hike near I-40 at the northern boundary of the Smokey Mountains. We've accomplished everything that was a part of our original intent and more, and everything is confirming our desire to rejoin our families.Another night with fellow snorers in the shelter,Mike Criner","Double Spring Gap Shelter

Right after we had arrived in Icewater Spring Shelter last night, the rain cut loose. A few late hikers had come in drenched from the rains, yet with no complaints. Getting wet is expected on the trail. Yet, we had only experienced some brief showers while hiking and all our gear had stayed dry (except for the normal dew and humid conditions that left everything a bit damp at times. One young lady had made the hike just to resupply another hiker with food that night. Although drenched to the bone, she was one of the most pleasant hikers in the shelter, even supplying Matt with a fresh apple from her pack - more trail magic.    Charles Bunyon is a popular view sight, but once again we saw nothing except a thick fog from 5500 feet. The Smoky Mountain views were proving elusive to us as to many who hike or vacation in the Gatlinburg area. The only thing that consoled me about the lack of photographic views was the fact that my I-phone was malfunctioning and had drained the battery, making it unusable. That's why you see no pictures of the Smoky Mountains in my journal entries.   After several ups and downs, we arrived at Tri-Corner Knob Shelter. The shelter normally sleeps 12, but tonight we squeezed in 17 hikers. Needless to say, we were a close bunch. You shared odors, snoring, rustling sounds of sleeping bags, and yet, somehow managed to sleep on and off from 9pm until 6am (dusk till dawn).   Tonight we contemplated the decision for tomorrows hike. We could go our planned 8 miles to Cosby Knob Shelter and then finish with a punishing 10 mile descent to Davenport Gap, or we could pull out all the stops for a full 18 mile hike and be done. It was a quiet evening for me. That night my journey was complete, even though 18 miles lie between the shelter and my ride back home. We were both ready to be home. We had lost several pounds. Our food supply was low. All of our clothing was well saturated with each day's journey. Feet were sore and blistered.

The backpack was packed for the last time and out of the shelter we went in full stride, confident that nothing would delay us from our destiny.   All went well for the first hour, with minor sprinkling, heavy dews that soaked our feet, and dripping from the canopy of trees overhead. And then the rain picked up, completely soaking us through for the first time in our four week journey.     We reached Cosby Knob Shelter shortly after noon, our original destination for the day, had a quick lunch, left a note for our newly formed family of friends an hiked on, knowing we had a punishing 10 mile downhill descent to Davenport Gap. Our legs were on auto, as often they were on the trail in the afternoon. Often you find your mind wandering, while legs and hands continue a steady pace, until, in a sudden moment, a bird or sharp sound shakes you back to your present environment.    As the afternoon progressed, weather improved, providing a drying out time as well as some closing views of the Smoky Mountains. Due to many reasons, we had enjoyed the mountains of GA an NC much more than the Smoky Mountains. Yet we had seen 75% of our wildlife sightings in the Smoky Mountains. We stopped for our usual second breakfasts and second lunches and backpack breaks and still managed to arrive at exit 415 just across the Pigeon Forge bridge at 7pm, just 10.5 hours of hiking and breaks and 18 miles later. Our ride was arriving around 8pm, so we searched through our food bags for a spare snickers bar and pepperoni stick and awaited our ride while sitting on the bridge.    Then, how should the journey end, but a passerby stopped in his car and said,""I've got something for you"" - and handed us a 32 ounce bottle of Gatorade, which we promptly consummed. Another passerby from Chicago got out of his vehicle to ask us about our hike. And then, in the last half hour, the rains returned as we covered up with our 99 cent tarps which proved to be one of the most valuable pieces of gear along the trail.    When my wife arrived, in a nurses face mask to deal with our God-created natural smell, we threw our gear into the trunk, along with wet shoes and socks, and entered a vehicle that moved away down I-40 at 70 mile per hour. In the time that we had walked 18 miles, that car had driven over 350 miles. And in just 3.5 hours we had enjoyed a meal at McDonalds, a modern Rest area, a shower, clean clothes and the re-introduction of a soft mattress.    The hike is now complete. the jury is out on the possibility of future section hikes. Now starts the introspection and the assimilation of our learned experiences on the trail to the remainder of our lives. All kinds of lessens are learned on a section or thru hike experience. Many of them are personal. Just like my relationship with Christ, many of those lessons cannot be communicated with words adequately - so they will remain personal to me just as they do to other hikers as well.    Thanks to all who followed my journey. Thanks to all who supported me with your prayers. Thanks to all those who looked after my family back home while I was away fulfilling a selfish ambition.

Tonight it was back to cheddar cheese instant mash potatoes. We had a campfire, made some smores, and retired at 9 PM. Pedometer steps were just 34,048 for the day.","Hot Springs

Realm IV,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/461862,"Today I struggled even for a short day. I had the option of going 9.6 miles to a shelter area or 15.5 miles to Jerry Cabin Shelter. Right now I have some congestion and a cough that is making it difficult for me to manage the steep climbs. My knees are so much better, but something is sapping all my strength. I'm not sleeping well at night, and am experiencing a weariness that is causing me to take too many and too long of breaks to get very many miles in. Today was a day of little views and lots of PUDS (pointless ups and downs). It's also Father's Day and I have no service with ATT to call or get messages.     The energy drink mix I use gives me a little kick sometimes, but not today. I left camp with just 32 ounces of water, relying on a spring listed in my AT guidebook, but the spring was never found. I had two choices - ration the water for the next 4 hours or do an extra mile and a half walk to Hemlock Hostel when I reached the Log Cabin Drive Road Crossing. I chose to push on, with ever increasing rest periods. The last 3.3 miles of the hike were all uphill, and I was so weak from the cold I was fighting, that I basically stumbled my way into Little Laurel Shelter with no water the last mile. I quickly consumed a full 32 ounces of filtered water and then made a meal of Spanish Rice with another 2 cups of water, trying to push all the liquids I could get into me. I'm forcing the food down, as I have no real appetite due to the heat exhaustion, some dehydration, and this nagging allergy type symptons.    But it was a beautiful day for hiking if you felt well. Several people were doing day hikes in this area due to the raod access from Greenville, NC. Oh how nice it would be to climb these mountains with just a water bottle and snack!! 3 hours after having lunch I cooked up a half serving of instant mash potates and tuna and drank another 20 ounces of water. Being overly tired despite the short day, I climbed into the hammock at 8 PM, a full hour before darkness began. Shortly after dark, the winds picked up and then the rain came, and came, and came. Boy, was I glad to be in the hammock. Still sleep was difficult due to chronic cough I had developed. I'm at a critical point in the hike. I'm having some respitory issues and I'm about to enter a section of the hike with little options for two days if I continue to get sicker, or I can turn back and hike 4 miles south to the hostel and try to regroup. We'll see what tomorrow holds. Only 27,191 steps on the pedometer today.","Spring Mountain Shelter

Realm IV,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/461868,"After a long night of rain (it has rained either during the day or night 5 of the 6 days), I awoke with a still worsened respitory condition. I had little choice but to make the call to access a ride off the trail. My blister on my heal has continued to deepen, making walking difficult - the cold/flu like symptoms are giving me a fatigue which rest is not giving me relief from. And some steep climbs await me from here to Erwin, TN. So, after taking a little extra time to pack up due to the damp conditions and threatening rain, I began my hike back south to the Hemlock Hostel, to either spend the night there or get a ride home. Along the way I was able to make phone contact to my family members in Richmond, KY, and it turned out that my son-in-law was available that day to make the 4 hour drive to get me off the trail.    Along the way, I met 4 day hikers, one of which turned out to be a retired Christian School Principal. After much conversation, it turned out that he was parked at Log Cabin Drive and was offering to drive me to the hostel or wherever I needed to go. Turns out that he drove me all the way to I-81 at a McDonalds to make things easier for my son-in-law to locate me (much shorter for him as well).    Despite the dissapointment of leaving the trail, I did have a highlight moment videoing a large king snake that crossed the trail in front of me. Sitting in an overly air conditioned McDonalds (it was freezing) was not good for my respitory issues. After three hours, 2 double Quarter Pounders, frys, and three large diet cokes, my ride arrived.    My flu-like symptoms continued to worsen throughout the evening and into the night, including running a fever and breaking that fever. I'm now resting in bed, hoping to rally at any moment. I now know that leaving the trail was the best thing for me at this time. I only got in just shy of 60 miles this year and they included both the challenges and victories of trail life - challenges...blisters, extremely sore knees, cramping thigh muscles during the day and cramping toes while sleeping at night, pure exhaustion, mosquitoes, sweat, heart-thumping climbs, effects of dehydration, being soaked through and through by rain, loss of appetite - victories...getting to the top, seeing the views, meeting interesting people, sleeping outdoors, seeing wildlife (bears, snakes, mice, salamanders, frogs, turtles, lots of different birds), hiking through rhododendron, hemlocks, spruce trees, different flowers - having time to appreciate what God has done for me and for all of us when we see life from His viewpoint.    This hike has been an additional learning experience for me. Our bodies have limits and I have to do a better job of respecting those limits. Future hikes will require a change in some equipment to lessen weight, and will need to be at a time which is more free of at-home concerns. As I write this final blog, my new grandson, Noah, is still in the hospital's NICU unit, my father is experiencing some ever presnt health needs with his care, and our church is without a Lead Pastor.     I will have to personally deal with coming up short of my goals for the hike this year. I will need to redefine my purpose and passion for the AT, which simply did not exist fully this year. Only other hikers will know what I mean. I envy those whom live close to the AT. My ride out of the AT was by a man who just completed that day his 299th hike (he documents them all - and he's 67 years old). And I'll continue to root others along on their journey's on the AT. Only 11,476 steps on the pedometer for my final day on the AT.","Little Laurel Shelter

Realm IV,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532311,"Will be on the trail in two days, beginning May 12th. I will sporadically add journal entries and photos as limited cell phone usage allows. Hoping and planning on doing well following torn meniscus surgery last spring. The AT will definitely be a real test of physical limitations. Looking forward to having my daughter (Blue Jay) and her husband join me in Damascus, VA for a one week hike to finish out this 4 week section hike.
