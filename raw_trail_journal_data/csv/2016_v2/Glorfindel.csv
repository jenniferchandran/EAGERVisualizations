Glorfindel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/499614,"After taking approximately a month off from any walking outside of work and around the house, my foot is feeling and doing much better. I'm fortunate to have had a couple of great PT's to work with. It will be awhile before I can get my mileage back up for long (12-16 mile) day hikes, but I'm headed in the right direction. Over the last several weeks, I've had to remind myself of my goal to thru-hike the AT and let my foot heal. I'm looking forward to incorporating walking back into my daily schedule.","

I started on Friday, October 9 and finished Sunday, October 11. Had some rain on Friday, but had beautiful weather on Saturday and Sunday. Overall, I'm happy with my equipment, but will be making adjustments on my tent. My foot was well behaved, though it started to fatigue on Sunday during the last 5 miles.","

Glorfindel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528478,"Started my hike at the visitor Center at Amicalola Falls State Park. My pack weighted more than I wanted at 41 pounds, but 8.8 pounds of it is water (4 liters). I will have a shake down at Mountain Crossings when I get there, to see what else I can get rid of. Hiked the first 1.5 miles without my pack. Said good-bye to my Mom again at the top of the falls and got my pack and was on the trail with my pack at 11am. I didn't see very many others till mid afternoon when I stopped for a short break. When I started hiking after my break, hiked on and off with Jennifer, Perry, Bryn (Perry's dad) and Keba (hope the spelling is right). Filled my 3 liter water bladder at Black Gap Shelter and that is the longest .1 mile to the spring for water. Got to the top of Springer Mountain at 6:40 pm, signed the register and headed to the shelter. I'm tired, 4 hours of sleep last night and the elevation gain didn't help, but my foot behaved.","Amicalola Falls Visitor Center

Glorfindel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529337,"The terrain was relatively level today compared to yesterday. Met a bunch of other hikers today, including two solo female hikers. One of the hikers I met at the shelter this afternoon was Pete, who is 80 years old. I hope if I make it to 80, I'm in as good shape as he is. He definitely inspired a bunch of us. I'm starting to wonder if I should continue to thru-hike or break my hike into a section hike. I love hiking, backpacking and camping, but at the moment the thought of doing this for 6 months isn't very thrilling. However, I'm also very tired, due to only 4 hours of sleep Monday night. I'll sleep on it tonight and see how I feel in the morning.","Springer Mountain Shelter

Thankfully, one of them had cell service and arranged for a shuttle through the Hiker Hostel. I think I'm going to turn my hike into a section hike and see how of the AT I can get done this year. I have the time off from work and by doing it in sections I can spend some extra time in areas along that trail, like the Smokies. The sections I don't get this year, I'll get in the upcoming years. I can also spend some time with my family, especially when my new niece or nephew arrives in April.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Glorfindel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529351,"I got a shuttle up to Mountain Crossings for a shake down of my pack. Thankfully, I only needed to make minor adjustments. I did invest in a new pack (weights less & easier to pack) and down jacket. I also had several questions answered. Since the workers at Mountain Crossings have thru-hiked the trail, I trust their opinion on the adjustments I needed to make and their packing suggestions. Had quite the adventure with my shuttle to the Amtrak station in Gainesville. I also had a very pleasant surprise to meet another female hiker while waiting to board the train. Candace had been hiking on the trail for a week or so. Both of us where glad to have another hikers company.","

I finally had my first scary fall today when hiking, about 1 mile south of the Pinnacle. Decided to avoid climbing over a downed tree by walking around a rather rocky section. Thankfully I was holding onto a small sapling, because my right foot caught on a rock I was stepping over and I came down pretty hard of my left knee and forearm.
