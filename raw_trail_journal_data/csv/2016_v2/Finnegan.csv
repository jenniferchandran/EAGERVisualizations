Finnegan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481420,"Well, today is my birthday. I'm 68. I've wanted to do the AT since college and have been thinking about this for the past year. So, I guess this post puts the stake in the ground. I'll start in 2017 or earlier, depending on when I pull the plug on retirement.",,View Entry,"Feb 11, Wed",0
Finnegan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522694,"Well, this is my second entry, one year later. I retired last October and will now start my hike on March 17th, St. Patrick's Day. I've been buying gear for the last year and have gotten in some practice overnights since leaving work. Tested the sleeping bag the other night. The bag is rated at 20 deg and it was 19 outside. I slept with everything on that I'll be carrying and still it started to get uncomfortable cold around 4 a.m. Hopefully there won't be too many cold nights left in this winter. Right now I'm trying to pack 10 pounds of ""stuff"" into a 5 pound bag, so to speak. It will get in there eventually. Base weight right now is running 24 lbs winter, 21 lbs summer. Maybe I can still shave some off. So, the rest of this week is more packing of boxes, cleaning the house, hiking with the pack, etc. Time is running down, 10 days to go.",,View Entry,"Mar 06, Sun",0
Finnegan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523023,"Packed the last boxes today. Pack weight with 4 days food looking like it will come in around 32 lb. I'll be happy with that. Will take a hike tomorrow up at Bradbury Mtn State Park. It will be raining hard, should be a good final test hike. Slept out in 19 deg the other day, uncomfortably cold but doable. I think 15 degrees would be the lower limit I'd want to sleep out.. Now just have to do the mundane things, like cleaning the garage and getting the car serviced. On the plane next Wed! It has been two years thimking and planning for this.",,View Entry,"Mar 09, Wed",0

His brother, Jack, had driven him from Atlanta to the starting point. With his full pack, he decided to give his brother his camera and his iPad, and keep just his phone. Because of that, I don't know if he will be making any trail journal entries for a while.   He was going to take it easy and work the cramp out of his leg. He found the weather warmer than expected, in the high 40s during the day. In this location, there were about 20 different campsites occupied. His evening meal was going to be a Freeze-dried dinner packet that he had purchased online.","Springer Mountain

NancyUPDATE: 9AM Saturday, he finally called.   It was the first time he had cell signals. Which might explain why SPOT is acting up also.   He recharged his phone during the night with one of those techie gadgets.    He is doing okay but needs to make up a mile today so he can make Lance Creek. His feet are doing okay.   Mood seemed good.UPDATE: 2PM Saturday.   Surprise, Surprise !   He was sitting on top of Cedar Mtn and decided to call since he had cell phone coverage. He wasn't sure if there would be coverage at Lance Creek Shelter, where he was heading, which is down in the valley.Before he got to Cedar Mtn, he stopped at a way station where they were serving lunch. So he scarfed down hot dogs and coke and brownies. This was near where the AT trail crosses of Route 60 in Georgia.He was having a nice day, a little cooler and windy, but Lance Creek was less than 2 hours away. and downhill. He had somewhat of a view as the trees had not leafed out yet. He's promising me some photos later.And the SPOT device sent its end of day automatic message, for the first time.

A little earlier start than his first three days.Today he hopes to get to Whitely Gap Shelter, approximately 6-7 miles away. He'll be passing Woods Hole Shelter, Blood Mountain Shelter and Neels Gap, Georgia (town). You might find interesting info if you Google these names.   NancyUPDATE 10:52. He's making good time today, per the SPOT device. He's already passed the East end of Slaughter Creek. But, I just realized it is actually a 14 mile hike today, so he is going to be huffing and puffing by the time he is done. No wonder he started early. Nancy.Update 11:25. Finnegan (Bob)called and is sitting on the top of Blood Mtn. Cloudy and windy and rocky. Already hiked about 7 miles today. Might stop at Neels Gap in the valley at the base of Blood Mtn. There is a hostel there which might have a vacancy. Otherwise, he'll stock up at the store and maybe mail things back to me and be on his way to another shelter.

Google Neels Gap Outfitters...looks like an interesting place. Plenty of food for him to buy. And he is staying in their hostel for the night. He is sending some things home that he doesn't need. It's just not getting as cold as he prepared himself for.

But mid-day temps are due to get up to about 50 degrees.   Stay tuned....NancyFinnegan appears to be doing a long haul today...about 12 miles all the way to Low Gap Shelter as opposed to Wide Gap Shelter. [ That's a joke !]FOUND THIS JOURNAL PAGE ON THE INTERNET. ""Snuffy"" has a good description of Finnegan's hike, though the weather may or may not apply. Here it is.... I head up the hill out of Neels Gap. At 9:40 AM it starts to drop rain. By 10 AM it's raining enough to get wet and make the rocks on the trail slick. Over the next hour I get rained on a few times. I stop once to rest my shoulders and once to rest my feet before taking a real break at 11:10 AM. A real break is when I shed my pack and or boots and write for a few minutes. I'm on top of something in a clearing (Wolf Laurel Top) overlooking the mountains below. I've hiked 3.4 miles so far. The sky is breaking and the sun is trying to peek through. My pace is getting better and my feet are hanging tough this morning. Ten minutes later, I'm ready to move on.    At noon I stop for a brief rest on top of Cow Rock Mountain, elevation 3,842 feet. Eight-tenths of a mile to the highway below. I plan a longer stop there at Tesnatee Gap. At 12:30 PM I reach the gap and stop and rest for thirty minutes. I've covered 5.5 miles.    I reach Hog-Pen Gap at 1:45 PM. I check out the spring, but decide to pass. It doesn't look all that appealing.    I cross the highway, turn left, and look for where the trail reenters the woods. The next couple of miles are some of the easiest we've had. Nearly level, wide sandy trail. Although the trail is good, I find myself walking a slower pace this afternoon. I finally stop just short of Low Gap Shelter at 3:15 PM for a break. So far today I've done pretty well. But I'm getting tired. Come on shelter. Get here quick. I find the sign to Low Gap Shelter at 4:05 PM and the shelter itself at 4:15 PM.   SNUFFY writes well, don't you think ?       Stay tuned.Update 4:04.   Bob called and is about 20 minutes away from Low Gap Shelter. He says it will be quite crowded tonight, with about 20+ hikers spending the night there. Presumably only about 7 fit in the actual shelter. He met another hiker, and his wife, from The Brunswick area.   LAST CALL.....7:15.....he's tired and sore and took an Advil.

He was starting out and heading for Deep Gap Shelter.    More later.   Nancy.Update 1pm.   He should be arriving at the shelter soon. I remembered to ask Finnegan Bob some questions.   No, he hasn't seen any animals on his hike, other than the requisite shelter mice.    This is good because in his Prep notes section he talks frequently about Snakes and Bears!He said most of the hikers avoid actually sleeping inside the shelters unless it is downpouring, and maybe not even then. If you do, sleeping is in very close quarters and health issues abound. Also, the shelter mice love the shelter and long ago figured out how to get into the hanging food bags.On Friday AM, he has a short 3-4 mile hike into the town of Hiawassee, GA. He is staying at a hostel there and will stock up on food, etc and take a shower and maybe wash clothes.    So it will be an easy day, which is good, because he has a 15+ mile hike on Saturday. Sometime on Saturday, he actually passes out of Georgia and into North Carolina. Update 2:00PM.   Finnegan has arrived at Deep Gap. But he is staying on top of the hill, as the shelter is further down the hill. He also strained his leg muscle a little today, so needs to take it easy.

See cute signpost in the Photo section.   Reminds me of some of our signposts here in Maine.    Nancy.Finnegan here. First ten days. Georgia has been very hard, sort of a shock to the system. The hills and mountains come at you like a wave train, one after another, never ending. I think the second day was the hardest, probably just the shock to the body. The weather has been good, snow once at Neel's Gap, rain last night. I'm being careful with water as many of the sources are way down off the trail. Also, I'm trying to hold myself to 8 miles a day if I can, to build my strength up. Hope to increase it a little next week. The Top of Georgia hostel is top notch. Well worth staying a night. Can't say enough about it. Had four trail magics : a church group, a ladies hiking club and some local Fellows. All were much appreciated.

I need to go find some photos for Bly Gap.Here's an interesting comment: At Bly Gap the AT leaves Georgia and enters North Carolina. Here the trail enters the Nantahala National Forest. Nantahala is Cherokee for 'land of the noonday sun'.

Finnegan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525011,"Finnegan here.   Breakfast is either cold cereal with dry milk or oatmeal, and coffee. I ditched the regular coffee for individual packets because they are lighter. One day it was a Snickers bar. Lunch is turning out to be pepperoni, cheese sticks or trail mix. Dinners so far have been freeze dried meals or Ramen with olive oil. I like the Ramen because of the liquid with it. Coming up I'll try some instant mashed potatoes. I also try to have some soup with it and a cup of tea. I way over planned food these first few weeks. I just don't have a good appetite yet, but that will come. Update at 2:30pm:   Finnegan called and they made it to Standing Indian in good shape. Though, I told him that, according to the SPOT map, they added on an extra hour when their ""leader"" took a left instead of a right.

Finnegan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525823,"Finnegan here. Aches and Pains is my story today.Well, some thoughts about aches and pains after two weeks on the trail. Remember, these are thoughts from a 69 year old guy. I think I was in reasonably good shape for my age when starting out. The first day out was warm and I made sure I drank plenty of water. But that night I had leg cramps so bad I almost screamed. I didn't plan for this, just something I missed. My wife sent down some magnesium pills to help. After the first night I've had only a few twinges. Others have mentioned the same problem. Water. I normally hike with a liter but consume more than two a day. There were some sections in GA where there are relatively long distances between water points. One thing I noted was that the first week or so I urinated only twice a day, morning and night. And it looked like used motor oil. I know that means I'm dehydrated, even with drinking 2+ liters a day. By now I'm back to normal. Just a heads up. Muscle pains. I had very bad muscle pains for almost a week. Everyone on the trail seems to have them, or knee problems. Mine were so bad I seriously thought I had to get off trail. I could barely hobble down a hill, but going up was not so bad. So, I've been downing the Advil and icing my legs when I can. It's a lot better now. One of the fellows I've been hiking with dropped out yesterday due to his knees. Even the young people are not immune. One last thing: I want to thank ""Sam I Am"" from last year who's video convinced me to wear a knee brace from day one. My knees have been ok, just not my muscles. Blisters have been about what I expected. I just tend to get them often, no matter what I do. I try to soak and powder my feet as often as I can. I haven't noticed anyone complaining of any illnesses like diarrhea. I'm pretty anal about keeping things clean. Day off: I really recommend you plan for a zero day, not just a NERO, sometime early in your hike. I did not know how exhausted my body was until we stopped yesterday. You need to give the body a break now and then. I think that's it for now. I wrote this last night while it was pouring rain, I was sitting on a porch in Franklin, NC, dry, and soon heading out for a milk shake and burger. Life is good.","Franklin, North Carolina

Finnegan and Tom were going to do a quick hike DOWN to the Nantahala Outfitters where they would each pick up their mail drop boxes with supplies. Then it was a 7 mile hike up a mountain.Here are Bob's comments for the day, which came to me via email: I have been thinking about today's hike since the beginning of this trip. It was a 3200 ft climb from bottom to top. This was the longest climb so far on the trail. We've hiked several thousand climbs, once two in one day but this was the first big one. So, it was difficult. A hot day and probably a 34 +/- pack. It took us just about 5 hours to top out. All in all, Tom and I were very pleased with how it turned out. So I get to do it again on Friday, our first day in the Smokies. Also saw my first snake today, a baby garter snake. Also, Finnegan Bob wanted to let you know that he does find it difficult to be ""wordy"" after hiking all day. But, apparently, his hiking partner is very good at it.

Finnegan says ""I do this every night. The ""dirty"" water is in the blue bag I'm holding. I squeeze it through the filter that's attached to it into a clean bag. Usually I do about 3-4 liters a night. The whole process takes 30-45 minutes, depending on how far away the water source is. This seems to be the most popular method out here but there are several other ways to do it. One thing I use is a 4-liter satchel to carry my dirty ( i.e. unfiltered) water back to camp. It has carrying handles on it that make it easier to transport than several bags. I haven't noticed anyone else yet using something similar. End of story"". All for now. NancyForgot to mention: as Finnegan rested and recuperated at the resort, he chatted with other hikers and apparently there were a lot of sick hikers on the trail this past week. Finnegan figures he screwed up by not washing his hands as frequently as he should have. He says normal procedure on the trail is NOT to shake hands when you meet someone. And not to ""share"" items.   It's also one of the reasons why he prefers to sleep in his tent, rather than in the shelter if there is one. Nancy.UPDATE, 3PM : Haven't heard from him, but the SPOT device says he has another hour or so to hike. I did find this journal entry online when I Googled Mollie's Ridge - an interesting version of the hike Finnegan is doing today ..."" The 2,700-foot climb looks formidable in profile covering 10.7 miles. The water sources are usually noted as unreliable. Add a weighty backpack fully loaded with food and water, and you have the potential for an hellacious day. I [the journalist] remain nervous and skeptical about this first day despite numerous backpacking experiences that prove my abilities, and perhaps this is best. Since things are rarely as bad as we fear, they can often wind up seeming quite easy in comparison. Such is the case here. I [the journalist] anticipate hardships that never develop, and in place of this imagined misery, I find a smooth, comfortable trail that appears to coast along level ridges as much as it ascends. End of quote. ""So, perhaps it won't be as bad as Finnegan feared.","Fontana Dam Resort about Mile 166

Finnegan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527444,"Good afternoon from Mrs. Finnegan. I was otherwise occupied this morning.Finnegan got off at his usual time, abt 8am, and was facing another 12 mile hike. As previously mentioned, the Smokey Mtn Park has rules about camping and the hikers have to be in the general vicinity of an official shelter for their night's stay. So he was heading for Derrick Knob. Supposedly in good condition with a good Spring nearby. Cell phone coverage tends to be a a little spotty, but is better than it was 5 years ago.One subject we haven't mentioned is the ""mail drops"". That's one way that the hikers obtain necessary food and other supplies. Someone sends them a designated care package to a specific address. Different outfitters, along the trail, agree to act as receivers [sort of like a UPS store]. The hiker then stops, at that point, and picks up his box. Finnegan pre-packed about 10 boxes with a lot of food supplies in the first 4. Then smaller boxes. So it appears he is changing to a different method after he receives Box #4. The smaller boxes tend to hold more health and medical supplies, that might be otherwise unobtainable along the way.   I think he will be buying more food supplies on the local market and there weren't a lot of places in the first month of the trip. I had told Finnegan that I would mail the boxes but that he had to pack them. So he spent the last week of his pre-trip divvying up food supplies and using a lot of Ziploc baggies. I mailed Box #4 today and it should arrive at its destination (Hartford, TN) by Wednesday, using Priority Mail. Each mailing costs $13-20; sometimes I have to do an overflow small box to go with the big box.All for now.    Mrs. Finnegan.","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Finnegan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527722,"I was offline yesterday. Talked with Finnegan Bob last night. He hit a snag in his hike yesterday. Or, more precisely, he hit his right wrist. Trail conditions were poor yesterday and he slipped in mud and landed on his right wrist.   Thankfully, shelter companions last night included an EMT guy and a nurse. Possible sprained wrist. So, he is hiking into Gatlinburg, TN, today to get it looked at. If it is a sprain, he'll probably head home within the next day or so.    The mileage posted for today includes the mileage from yesterday. Feeling sad. Nancy.UPDATE, 4pm: He's arrived in Gatlinburg and is staying at the Hampton Inn. He'll go to a local walk-in clinic tomorrow morning. I found one online.PS: Gatlinburg itself doesn't have a hospital, just a walk in clinic.","Derrick Knob Shelter

Finnegan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527886,"Robert Neely will be home in Maine about 2pm on Saturday. He just spent a couple of hours in an Urgent Care Center in Gatlinburg. They inspected his arm, and took xrays and think it is a fracture. But, a fracture doesn't show on the xray, so they said it might be a stress fracture which would show in a couple of days. But, they put a brace on, and wrapped it and gave him a sling. So, he will go see his own doctor when he gets home. And Medicare did cover it, after all.    He'll spend one more night in Gatlinburg and then take a cab ride to the hotel at the airport in Knoxville. He has a 7:15 flight out on Saturday morning.It's been a grand affair !   Finnegan will probably be back at some point in the future.    Signed, Mrs. Finnegan.UPDATED April 22nd:   On the last two days of his hike, and once injured, Bob was a little vague about where he was spending the night and where he was heading the next day.    He walked a long distance that last day in order to get to Clingman's Dome, which is at Mile 199.1.So I have tried to adjust the hiking numbers so that they are reasonably accurate. As far as Finnegan is concerned, he officially hiked the trail all the way to Clingman's Dome.FURTHER UPDATE:   Finnegan has officially been notified that he has a fracture in his arm.   We are waiting to hear from a Sports Med doctor that he has been assigned to.   He really wants to resume hiking, so was hoping for just a sprain. So, he will be facing a longer recovery period.   Mrs. Finnegan.","Silers Bald Shelter
