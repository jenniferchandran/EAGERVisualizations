Tear Drop ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505914,"Well, it has been 48 hours since I made the announcement that I was returning to the Appalachian Trail in 2016. I have since then posted 3 videos on the New 2 The Wild YouTube channel. I feel like I can't eat or sleep since the AT defeated me last year. I am excited as can be about returning to the trail alone and attempting this hike with no interference. I have to re-purchase my gear, but I have quite some time to do this. I am glad that this time I have some serious time to be able to prepare. I spoke with Wes aka the Milkman yesterday and he made it to New Jersey. He is actually going to finish this thing. I am happy to see that. I have to admit that I am slightly jealous. Since the trail, I got back with my wife and have gotten my life a little more straightened out. I am not on the ""road"" as much traveling and it feels good to sit a little still. I now currently live in Denver, Colorado which means that I will be doing my shake down hikes in the Rocky Mountains this year. I look forward to this wonderful hike. This is the beginning once again...This time I have some experience and am as focused as can be. I look forward to 2016 and finishing this trail.",,Good 2 Be Back ,"Jul 18, Sat",0
Tear Drop ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505915,"I have decided on starting with people like a normal hiker this time. My last two thru-hike attempts started on December 8th and February 10th. Those dates were a little too early for someone with limited experience. Don't get me wrong, it can easily be hiked starting those dates, but when I say easy, I mean for an experienced hiker. I have decided to take this time to prepare more than ever and start with the rest of the group on March 1st. No more trying to be the tough guy and odd man out. I am excited to see my first trail magic and actually hike with a bigger group of people. Also, I am excited to know that all of the businesses will be open. I admit, it will be hard to sit here and wait all the way until March, but it is for the best. I will actually be at Amicalola State Park on February 28, 2016 so I can get a good start and get to Black Gap Shelter by the 1st in order to start off Springer on the 1st.",,"Start Date is March 1, 2016","Jul 18, Sat",0
Tear Drop ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505916,"I have not gotten all of my gear yet NOR my Big 3, but I can tell you now what I am probably going to purchase. On my second attempt, I had the Gregory Z65 Pack (3 lbs 9 oz)and it was a beautiful and comfortable pack. I loved that pack very much. It was around $239.00 if I remember right. I will tell you now that it was worth every single dime. I have heard that Osprey has outstanding customer service though, so I may consider going in their direction if I can find something better than the Gregory. I can tell you this...As I watch ""August"" and his AT vids on YouTube, I have seen that REI's packs with their name on it is something that they will NOT stand by. He has had the same pack twice and it has ripped both times. They will not replace them. So, I may just stick with the Gregory. Speaking of REI, I will recommend their tents. Last time, I had the REI Quarter Dome 3 and it was perfect. I had an extra person with me though, so I may not need something that big this time. It was easy to assemble, spacious, and light. It was expensive though at $379.00. It only weighed 4 lbs 3 oz. I am probably going to go with a different tent this year. If you have any suggestions out there, feel free to put it in my guestbook. In terms of sleeping bag, last year, I went with the Kelty Ignite 16. It was a wonderful sleeping bag and I recommend it to everyone. I will probably get the same sleeping bag this time. There was times that I was HOT and I hiked in the winter. Because I am leaving later, I may consider a cooler sleeping bag though. This one was $269.95. It weighed 2 lbs 11 oz and was easy to deal with. These are more than likely going to be the same gear I take this year. In my opinion, not too bad of a big three despite the $890 price tag. The weight for the three was pretty good too at 11 lbs basically. I already have the MSR Pocket Rocket to cook with and the Sawyer Mini Filter for my water. I would recommend both of those to any new hikers out there. I believe the Pocket Rocket is $40 and 3 oz and the water filter is $25 and 2 oz.",,The Big 3 - Gear ,"Jul 18, Sat",0
Tear Drop ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/506235,"You know, for as much as I typically talk about how the hiker community on Trail Journals and White Blaze can be a pain in the a**, I have to admit that today I received an email that warmed my heart. There are a lot of times that this actually happens and I fail at times to speak on it. About 90% of the hiker community that I meet online are WONDERFUL people. There is always the 10% that are bitter or mad or just flat out a$$holes. With that being the case, I think I dwell on the negative more than the positive. Well, today I got an email from a guy that said my videos have inspired him. I do my videos and journaling for myself, but I always love it when someone tells me that it inspired them. Today's email seriously made my day. One email said that I was a breath of fresh air to the community while this one said that I am the type of person that he and his wife hopes that he meets on the trail. Well, a good reason for that is because every on here is so PC...look at the youtube videos and you will see what I mean. I happen to be one of the few people that speak with my emotions and typically ALWAYS come with a real message whether you like it or not. There are FAR MORE people that appreciate than people that don't. When I get emails from the people that do, it makes documenting this journey and sharing it with you people ALL THE MORE worth while. Thank you to that gentleman for his email and it made my day. I look forward to seeing you in March my friend. Keep the dream alive and never let anything kill it. Especially the people and keyboard warriors that we spoke of in the email. These people simply just gotta understand that hikers come in all walks of life and not everyone is going to think the same. Some of us are going to be the complete opposite of what is expected...That is what makes the trail so great...THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS.",,The Most Amazing Email ,"Jul 19, Sun",0
Tear Drop ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/506455,I wonder if my journal is ever going to go public...lol. I signed up and posted my first three journals five days ago and my journal still is not public. Oh well...just figured I would mention this for when it eventually does go public. What is odd is that my journal has 140+ views despite not being listed. Hey Trail Journals....PUBLISH ME...lol...I need the link for my other sites. #Conspiracy #BlackListed #ImOnToYou #JustKidding,,5 Days and Still Waiting...,"Jul 21, Tue",0
Tear Drop ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507924,"First off, I am excited as can be about once again being in preparation for the AT. It fills my day with something VERY worthy of doing and I am excited just as much now as I have ever been. I also think I know what's wrong with my Trail Journal...I think I just needed to mark it ""Active"" in the options. We will see if this one will post. I have been back to doing my videos again on the channel and MOST of the comments have been nothing but positive. Of course, I am just sure that the trolls haven't learned that I am back on the scene....lolI have been reading a lot of people's journals and it looks like there is gonna be one hell of a group this year. I am excited as can be.",,I think I just figured it out...,"Jul 30, Thu",0
