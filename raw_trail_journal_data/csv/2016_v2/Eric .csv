Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479375,"According to my calculator, I have 2,296 hours of actual work left before I'm free of these shackles that have bound my arms and legs to a desk job for the past 29 years. I note, with some interest, that the total number of actual miles in a thru-hike is a similarly large number. It's not that I don't enjoy this work which I do, it's that as I approach retirement my fixation on commencing a thru-hike has become somewhat of a nagging obsession. Perhaps a journal will alleviate some of the stress of this rigorous pre-hike preparation. This Friday, we (my wife and I) plan on having dinner with a 2013 successful soloist thru-hiker whom I've yet to meet in person. It is with trepidation and forboding that I anticipate hearing of the excrutiating and woeful task of tackling the entire hike in one fell swoop. I hope that she is merciful in the telling. That's 328 work days X 7 hours= 2,296.",,View Entry,"Dec 24, Wed",0
Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480375,"The dinner date went well-my wife had asked a few pointed questions, ""you slept in a hammock for 2 months?""; ""your toenails really dropped off, and that's normal?"". Our hiker friend offered to pay the check but the value of the opportunity to learn first hand what a thru-hike could mean was well worth the effort of the interception. How generous of her, I thought. We peppered her with questions such as, ""what did you eat?"", ""what did you take?"" Another month has passed and I am creeping painfully forward towards my retirement date...it seems that the more I focus on it, the further away it becomes. I am keeping fairly true to my resolve to stay fit and in good shape: I'm running on the treadmill 3-4 times a week...running outside at least once/twice a week- 5K...Doing sit-ups etc. trying to eat non-processed food etc. No plans yet to try camping outside which I have not done since 1979! My wife seems at least willing to entertain the idea of a thru-hike. She has always been up for an adventure and deals with sudden change quite well...glad I married her.",,View Entry,"Jan 20, Tue",0
Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481921,"Driving in to work today- it was minus 6...A bunch of stuff has happened this month. On 2/5/15 the union had a tentative contract agreement vote which would have resulted in either a significant financial hardship post-retirement or would have extended my earliest possible leave date out by about 8 months- either way, the plan to hike the AT in 2016 would have suffered some set-back. As it turned out, the contract was voted down by a wide margin and now we go to impasse which could take several years to resolve. As a result, I am back to the planning and imagining stage. My wife is not intending to retire like I am so she may just join me for parts of the hike. I'm hoping to convince her to do the whole thing but she, knowing her, will want me to pay her a per diem rate for lost work ! As she manages all the bills, all the shopping, all the cooking etc. I may take her up on the notion of paying her a stipend!!! How crazy is this!!?? I have no inclination to meet/make new friends along the AT (I'm a social worker) so having a hiking partner in the first instance is appealing...I'm hoping to convince her between now and then...she loves hiking gear (especially the footware)so doing the research and making the purchases may inspire her to take the 4-6 months off that I expect the hike will take. As of today, I have 290 days of work left...which is 2,030 hours ...seems like a ridiculously big number but I am chipping away at it and trying not to think about it.",,Cold Wave,"Feb 20, Fri",0
Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/484608,"Took my wife to the airport this AM at 5:30. I noticed a possible glow from northern lights on the horizon. The last time aurorae were visible in western NY was in the spring of 2004. Funny how I'm in crazy count-down mode to be traveling myself....I can experience the freedom felt vicariously through observation but tomorrow there's work and the daily grind. I'm one month or one day ahead of myself with 270 days of work and 14 months counting. I'm seriously considering leaving for the AT by walking down our little street, through the fields and back roads to the Greenway which connects to the Fingerlakes Trail which connects to the Long Trail which connects to the AT.",,Northern glow on the horizon,"Mar 22, Sun",0
Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/489882,"My son Charlie and I did a 30 mile hike several weeks ago through Letchworth Park consuming the better part of 10 hours...nice to be outdoors again. This past weekend, my wife and I did a 35 mile bike trip...can't say that I'm not at least trying to prepare for the AT.....Gear seems to be the unknown variable....We laughed yesterday about the fact that what's the worst thing that could happen on an AT through hike? We quit; we get bored; we get injured ...so what- not having to return to a 9-5 job is the best part of it all (except for the ultimate privelege of being able to do it in the first place)...I get the strong sense that my wife will be attempting the through hike with me as she has indicated recently that she is up for it.....I told her that statistically, there is a major liklihood that we would start the hike, and never finish (we both like a challange - we're still married to one another). So, another month here at the job....counting down....AT gear will be a consideration for way off into the future...1736 hours of work time left -can't wait!!!!!",,Spring Leaning,"Apr 21, Tue",0
Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497042,"Planning on a 4 day hike to the high peaks Adirondacks region next month...did a long bike ride yesterday on the Genesee Valley Greenway....anything to keep in shape and my mind off of work as I near the 1 year point of departure. Did not get to stop to look for arrowheads as I usually would during this time of year as I had spontaneously met up with a fellow bike rider and we spent the AM biking (furiously I might add)...by the time we circled back to the beginning of the trail, I was on my last leg and was barely able to peddle home much to my wife's chagrin....49.03 miles ! He had some prior experience hiking and climbing etc and said that a thru hike on the AT was a great idea and that I should just do it and see what happens...He reiterated the notion that far too many people never really get outside of their comfort zones (that's given that they have the good fortune do so in the first instance) and take little to no risk doing anything above and beyond at all. My revised countdown as of today, including planned vacation/holidays/floating holidays etc. is: 244 days of work= 1,708 hours.",,View Entry,"May 27, Wed",0
Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501790,"We made an offer on a small farm in Nicaragua and it was accepted.... I will still be making an attempt on the AT but my wife will probably prefer to head to Nicaragua to stay on the new little farm...in a few weeks, we will attempt the Adirondack high peak zone for a four day hike...can't wait! Work continues to be a major obstacle but I'm managing...Lots going on...I'm now listing my truck on ebay to help with the purchase of the farm....already have a bid! I'm counting 1540 hours of work left......looking forward to next year in a major way....",,2nd house,"Jun 22, Mon",0
Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/506351,"Sold the truck and we closed on the house in Nicaragua....this past weekend, I rode the bike 45 miles to Greg's cottage outside of Dansville....otherwise known as the ""Hill of Sin""....the heat was up there so I must have had at least 3 litres of water on the ride down....I like the camelback water system...rode back home the following morning before the sun was too hot. In 2 days, I will try my first hand at camping/hiking...the plan is 4 days and three nights -high peaks area of the Adirondacks....we pitched the little tent in the yard as a practice....pretty heavy for such a small 2 man tent!!! Food supplies look funny- candy bars and granola! I finally figured out the no-start issue on the Vw cabriolet...nothing but a stuck plunger in the fuel distributor...easy fix and I drove into work today after several weeks of biking and scrounging for rides.....retirement is going to be a peice of cake......I'm now down to 199 days left of work.....trying to do a good job so that I can have peice of mind....that's 1393 hours left...My nephew told me last week that he will take me to Kitaddin.....this is all coming together....YIKES!",,View Entry,"Jul 20, Mon",0
Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511192,"charlie and I went back to the high peaks this past weekend and nailed lower wolf jaw, armstrong, gothics, saddleback and basin on day 2.... We camped and put in some serious climbing...I learned the importance of knowing how to assemble your tent in the dark in the rain....after fumbling about, I finally realized that the fly is not the tent...what a disaster that was!....Daysi is down in Nicaragua this week taking care of the new place....we'll be going there in October for a short vacation. Footwear will be a big issue...I will most likely be getting some beefy type trail running shoes...the mountain type boots are too heavy! Daysi has agreed in principal to join me on the AT...can't wait.....as of today...down to 1300 total hours left before full retirement.....We really got a better understanding of pack weight on this last backpacking trip....can you get it down under 20 lbs?  ",,View Entry,"Aug 24, Mon",0
Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514089,"Interesting that the AT has been in the news on several fronts recently: a movie on the topic and a white-collar crime absconder hiding in the midst! Hopefully the two developments will cancel out each-other and have no measurable impact on human traffic trail volume. Still making plans to do the AT...Had to push back a projected start date to late June, early July...Have been contemplating departing from the front door, on foot, hiking to the greenway, FLT, LT and then the AT heading north to do that section...Then driving Daysi's Jeep to Managua in the late Fall and starting back on the AT the following Spring- early on. We are heading down on vacation in two weeks to Managua- will try and do some hikes. Interested in doing Mombacho and Madera Volcanoes both of which are supremely spectacular....day hikes....Calculating 167 days left of formal work (1169 hours).   ",,View Entry,"Sep 22, Tue",0
Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516348,"Just returning from 3 weeks vacation to a mountain of paperwork, emails, voicemails and co-worker inquiries....I have been reminding myself all day that a lot of people would be happy to have the problems that face me....great vacation to the new home in nicaragua.....Still planning to do the AT in late June...possibly starting at Kattadin and going as far as possible depending upon how rough and inclement the weather gets heading south and up in altitude. My son is hoping to join me and he is fit and fast so we will probably make great time as we both like to keep moving. 1092 hours left to work and then time to get to work.",,View Entry,"Oct 26, Mon",0
Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517587,"I've been slacking with the physical training aspect of the AT preparation of late but am making plans on returning to the routine of hiking, running, sit-ups etc. Making some progress on the gear. I don't get how some people want your useless information- I happened to switch my health care plan today during open-enrollment and the HR woman asked me why? I told her that I had recently lost a bet...She grimaced-I could tell that she knew that her options with me were limited....Open-enrollment is just that: open-enrollment! The car rental lady asked me this morning what kind of new car was it that I was getting...I told her, ""one that hopefully will meet my needs""...After she got me a good deal on the rental, I politely answered her original question- why did she care anyways??! She did know something about cars- after chatting with her. I suppose that's all it really is- people just like to chat! My wife is retiring in 10 weeks- she is even happier than me. The current plan that is now being formulated will be to leave home on foot (I love this idea!)- hiking to the Fingerlakes Trail (Letchworth Spur) and then hiking East for approximately 450 miles to Harriman St Park, NY and then hiking north to Maine from there on the AT. The Southern section of the AT to be completed in the Spring of 2017. My calculator is now showing 138 days left of work x 7 hours = 966 hours.   ",,One more silly question....,"Nov 20, Fri",0
Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518579,"WOW...one year later from my initial entry into this on-line journal. My countdown calendar at work has me down to 118 actual working days left...That's 826 hours- I don't count weekends, holidays etc as on those days, it's just me, much as I anticipate I will be once I hit the trail! Looks like Daysi is out at this point- she will send us care packages and coordinate from our home position. As much as I really want her to go with me, a two man tent is not nearly as nice as a pretty big house with a pretty big bedroom with a major king-sized pillow-top mattress....I told her that I would be getting a solar USB battery charger; lots of music and books on tape and that we could Bluetooth simulcasts and then discuss everything as we hiked along.....She stated that we could be doing all of that now! She's right, but it has to be different while on a multi mile hike! So it still looks like a late June departure...We've been walking 3-4 miles a day- no major biking here in Upstate , NY although it was 68 degrees last week and it's expected to be around 60 on Christmas Eve. Global warming? Things are starting to heat up....",,View Entry,"Dec 21, Mon",0
Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519970,"Major frigid blast of arctic air on the heels of the warmest DEC on record here in Upstate , NY. Last night we watched YOUTUBE videos of thru-hikers and their equipment/prep/advice narratives. What a surprise when one of the very down to earth hikers displayed his 4 day supply of food based upon his extensive experience and expertise: ramen; snickers bars; Cheetos; etc! We were really expecting to see something a bit more in alignment with the old, healthy mind; healthy food establishment! We actually started to laugh out loud! Realistically though, maybe that's all that will be available to those of us who do not intend on doing mail drops etc. Looks like 3rd week in June is going to be the approximate departure date. I have 99 days left of actual work and could not be happier about that. We will plan on doing Bluetooth audio with a split signal so as to have contemporaneous talking points to discuss after setting up for the night after a long slog. Hoping to make the whole thing work-and not to quit after a few weeks....Daysi went down to the new house in Nicaragua and has stopped working (finally!). She's not missing much here but we are missing her.",,View Entry,"Jan 21, Thu",0
Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521558,Wow! Can't really wrap my head around the notion that this is all finally coming together....I've decided to go minimalist with the gear and preparations. Current thinking is a bivy sack and a lightweight tarp for shelter-will probably use one of the packs that we already own. Will try and find lean-tos along the way and crash at a holiday inn express whenever lucky enough to find one en-route. I'll work on a Friday and leave the next day- Saturday. Charlie is all for it and has agreed to join me...should be a great experience. Daysi is down in Managua loving the warm weather- she does not relish the thought of living outside for so long! I'm down to the final 500 hours of work (can't believe it!!!) I keep reminding myself that even a crappy day on the trail will beat a great day at work!!!,,View Entry,"Feb 22, Mon",0
Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524323,"Wow- fantastic weekend scoping out the Letchworth Trail spur of the Fingerlakes Trail. The weather was brisk and the disappointment of having to turn back and head to the car set in earlier that usual. It was a hot topic of discussion the notion of seeing new terrain with nowhere else to go but forward- must be nice! Work continues to drag along- I have come to the unfortunate realization that I have made but little impact on the systems that I labor within. Seems like since I started, the problems have gotten bigger and worse- wow, what a feeling of inadequacy that permeates my professional psyche. I should be pretty good and setting up a tent and being friendly to other travelers as I happen upon them. Counting the days now- remaining in days: 51 weeks- about 10. Staff meetings - 2 scheduled!",,View Entry,"Mar 21, Mon",0
