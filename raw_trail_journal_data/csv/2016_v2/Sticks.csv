Sticks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526879,"Sandy and Darby joined me for first day on the trail. We parked at the AT Conservancey and rode to gathland park with a couple of trail Angels, Debbie and her Indian friend. We decided to travel N then walk south back to our truck for the day.They were a couple of free spirits, and really nice. They introduced us to their friend who runs a local motel, where we would spend the next three nights. The weather was blowing the squirrels out of the trees and it was much colder than we expected. They gave sandy some gloves to use and donate back to the local hiker box. The trail was hilly and rocky- but very pleasant. At the Ed Garvey shelter we met a few folks day hiking and one through hiker, a red headed lady who will come into play at a later entry. We stopped for a photo op at the Weaverton cliffs, just beautiful overlooking the Potomac River. The end of the trail was part of the C&O canal, running along the railroad tracks. The turtles were sunning themselves on logs on the canal. We really enjoyed the historical downtown. We went into the old firehouse where John Brown was captured leading his uprising against slavery. We visited a beautiful old church overlooking the Shenandoah River where it meets the Potomac. The first day was fun and educational. Darby was tired, and toward the end I was nursing a painful knee....not good. Topped off the day with some Pizza! Better enjoy while I can!","harpers ferry maryland

Sticks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526884,"1st day on my on- flip flopping from the 70 exchange back to Gathland Park to meet Sandy. Slack packing while I can to get my trail legs plus a good breakfast at the Mountain View Diner. Started out with some humor when she squirted ketchup in her face. . Sandy walked with me for about 2 miles before turning back. I could hear Darby barking for a long time he didn't like the idea of leaving me in the woods! The trail quickly turned to rocks sticking up which made the walk difficult. I stopped at the little Washington Monument, the first in his honor but it was closed due to a lightening strike. Next on the trail was General Reno's (a civil war General) monument at Fox Gap. I met a man on the trail who was visiting the area because his great great uncle was killed there in a battle. Very interesting to hear his story. I took in the view at White Rocks Cliff. My knee was really giving me fits and I was wondering if I was going to make it but I did. I met up with Sandy and Darby back at Gathland Park. she was full of stories about hikers she had met and given rides to into town for supplies. We returned to the Mountain View for dinner and stayed again at Knights Inn. Enjoying the support while iI have it.","gathland park
