Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529789,"Well, here it is, time to get back on the trail. In the past two years, I have done sections with my sisters. In 2014, I hiked about 1000 miles with my sister, Tracy McG (now Out on a Limb). In 2015, I hiked about 400 miles with another sister, Breezy. We have been joined at times by our youngest sister, Blondie. I have also hiked with my nephew and his girlfriend. This year didn't look very hopeful for hiking. My father-in-law had been in the hospital and needed a great deal of care, which I supply since I stopped working. Unfortunately, shortly after his 97th birthday, he passed away. While we miss him, we realize that he lived a long and mostly happy life. So I will be hiking this year after all. It has been hard to come to grips with all of the changes, and get ready to go. I will spend a weekend in Ohio visiting family, and then Breezy and I will head back out. See you out there.",, ,"Apr 25, Mon",0
Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530022,I am experimenting with typing my journal on my cell phone. This has been an issue for me in the past because it used up too much battery. I am now typing it on a notepad app and should be able to copy it to the clipboard and then just paste it into my journal. I hope it works out as it will be much easier to update that way.

Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530388,"Well, here it is... my third entry.Tomorrow I will leave for Ohio to visit family there and pick up Breezy.   I have my pack all done. It weighs more than I had hoped, but we are starting out with a six day food supply, so that accounts for a lot of the weight. That will go down each day. Phew!Congrats to Breezy's husband, Chuck, who retired today. Breezy is throwing a party for him, which I will be able to attend with my husband. We haven't been many places together in recent years because someone always needed to be at home with his parents. He will get to meet many new nephews and nieces. some of them are already teenagers. All of them are terrific. I always enjoy a chance to be around my Ohio family.After that, it's back home for one night and then we will be on our way. I am very excited about this year's hike through the Smokies and the southern part of the trail.",,Third Entry,"Apr 28, Thu",0
Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531268,"Today Breezy and I are on our way to NC where we will stay with a friend overnight. Tomorrow we will go to Erwin TN to begin our hike south to Springer Mountain. After a weekend visit with family in Ohio, we started out this morning from my home in NJ. We have gone from the tense rush hour traffic of NJ, through PA, MD and WV. Now we are in the beautiful rolling hills of VA, with mountains on each side, in the middle of a torrential rain storm. We have many memories of hikes through the areas we now driving through.The rain got so bad that we pulled off to wait it out. We are keeping an eye on the parking lot in case the water gets deep.After the rain stopped we continued on through the rest of Virginia and into Tennessee. The mountains were beautiful. We finally arrived after driving nearly seven hundred miles. Our friend Chris made us vegetarian chili which was delicious and after a nice visit we are in bed and dreaming about starting our hike tomorrow. Tomorrow we will probably be dreaming about a warm, dry, soft bed.",,View Entry,"May 03, Tue",0
Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532463,"Breezy and I spent the morning getting ready to go, and Chris drove us back to Erwin. We all had lunch at Huddle House, and then said goodbye to Chris. The hike out of Erwin was steep and our packs were heavy with food. In addition, my lack of training really showed on the uphills. We did eventually make it to Temple Gap and then headed on to the shelter. There are a lot of people here, mostly thru hikers. We set up our tents and then threw our bear line. We are not very happy with it. A bear could easily get our food. After dinner of Subway sandwiches and a small orange, we are ready for bed. It is raining, so tomorrow we will carry wet tents. I am hoping to sleep well tonight in spite of the rain. It's great to be back on the trail.","Erwin, TN

Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532521,"Bald Mountain ShelterIt rained off and on for most of the night last night and got very chilly. No bears found our food so we had breakfast in our tents. The batteries in my headlamp died during the night. I had fresh batteries with me so I changed them this morning when I could see again. The day was very cold. We started out with a gentle climb and then crossed since beautiful streams and waterfalls. After Spivey Gap we started to climb. We had two very long and steep climbs. I am still running out of air on the steep climbs and had to go very slowly. We stopped at Whistling Gap campsite to get water. Other hikers warned us that it would be cold at the shelter buy we decided to continue. It was wicked weather over that mountain with a lot of wind, hail and snow. We had hoped to get a spot in the shelter but it is full, so we are back in our tents. It is still raining and snowing and we are very cold. Hopefully we will stay warm enough in our sleeping bags. Mine is a little wet from last night. We are eating a hot dinner in the tents.","No Business Knob Shelter

Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532522,"Through the night it started to snow a thick heavy snow. I woke up during the night feeling very cold and discovered that my tent wall was sitting on my back, full of snow which was melting onto my sleeping bag. I had to shake the whole tent to get the snow off. It happened several more times during the night. Breezy and I started warm enough but I had a lot of moisture on everything in my tent. When we got up it was beautiful out. We packed up and headed over Big Bald. It was in a cloud and the trail was mud and slush which made for slow going. We had lunch at Low Gap and then on to Sam's Gap. We passed a beautiful high meadow. Finally we headed up the last stretch to the shelter. We found the water source to be an extremely muddy hole but we got water for the night and made dinner. It is cold again but not as cold as last night.","Bald Mountain Shelter

Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532524,May 7. Flint Mountain Shelter. 8.8We got started a little late this morning because it was cold and we didn't want to get out of bed. The hiking was not as hard today. We stopped for lunch at a big rock with a little stream nearby. The weather was just beautiful. It warmed up and started to feel like spring again. Beautiful views and meadows all day and wildflowers all over the place. We stopped for water at a cascade and washed our faces and hands. Now we are at Flint Mountain Shelter. We got here early enough to have time to relax. It is still warm and very pleasant. Magic Man played us some tunes on his small guitar. He is practicing for Trail Days. It is a nice group here and we are sleeping in the shelter for a change.,"Hogback Ridge Shelter

Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532565,"This morning we expected Magic to get up at 5:30 because he said would but his alarm went off at 6:30 and the whole shelter got up. We had a steep climb from Flint Gap and then not too hard for a while. We climbed up Big Butt Mountain and went over a rock scramble. We stopped at Jerry Cabin Shelter for lunch. We heard about trail magic but we knew we would be too late. After lunch we headed up to Firescald Knob, which is actually about a mile and a half of difficult rock climbing on an exposed ridgeline. The views were wonderful. After coming back down we sat on a rock and a dog came along looking for food. He followed us quite a way until we came across a family hiking and they knew his owner. They took charge of him after that. We were pretty exhausted and started looking for a place to camp. We filled up on water at a spring and then carried it about another more until we found a campsite. Of course there is a nice little brook here so we didn't need to carry that water. We set up camp, had dinner and are in bed.","Flint Mountain Shelter
",Jones Meadow,"May 08, Sun",11.10
Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532568,"We had an early start this morning and were on the trail at 7:30. After a mile or so going up we started on a long downhill. As we got near Little Laurel Shelter, we started to encounter nobos on their way up. They had a long climb in getting of them. We stopped at the shelter for breakfast. We are out of our hard-boiled eggs and yogurt tubes, so we were down to breakfast bars. Afterwards we continued our long downhill to Allen Gap and then went a little ways down the road to Mom's, a little run down store. We got sodas and chips and say outside to eat. The owner, Duane, was very nice and told us his father had built the store. After lunch we had three very steep mountains to climb. Shortly afterwards we came to the shelter. We considered hiking on to a campsite but we were tired and decided to stay the night. We are staying in the shelter as it looks like it could rain. The group here tonight is fresh out of Hot Springs and full of energy but quite friendly. We are going to bed early and heading into town tomorrow.","Jones Meadow

Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532570,"We were the first people up in the shelter this morning but once one person is up everyone gets up soon afterwards. We headed out and started up our first mountain. About half way up we stopped at a campsite for breakfast. We could already see a lot of fire damage but the campsite wasn't burned. We were in great moods all day because we were heading into town. The hiking was fairly easy, mostly downhill. The nobos coming out of Hot Springs were having a difficult time with packs full of food and steep climbs. We stopped for lunch at a campsite overlooking Hot Springs and the French Broad River. We met some hikers there including Legs, who was downing a beer he had carried up the hill and didn't want to carry it any longer. I offered to carry the can back down for him. It was a steep and rocky climb down. The walk along the river was beautiful and relaxing, and we took our time. We watched a kayak lesson on the river. When we got into town we got a room at the Alpine Court. After showers and phone calls to home we went for a great dinner at the tavern and then to bed.","Spring Mountain Shelter
",Hot Springs,"May 10, Tue",11.10
Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532713,"It was just pouring this morning with lots of lightning. We could hardly even see the mountains. After some deliberation we decided to stay another night here. After waiting for a break in the rain we went over to the diner for breakfast. After breakfast we gathered together everything that could go into a washer and headed over to the laundry. We are going to get our Smoky Mountain permits this afternoon and head to the dollar store to get a free items for resupply. We want to go to the outfitter for a few items. I may get some gaiters to help my heels stay drier. Many people are heading out and many more have decided to stay. The weather calls for rain for a few days so we will all be getting wet anyway. 
I decided against the gaiters and got new socks with some extra padding thanks to the advice of the outfitter. Hopefully they will help. Breezy and I had another good dinner at the tavern. I repaired my raincoat zipper and made some phone calls. Soon it will be time for bed. We had fun in Hot Springs but we have to leave in the morning. If tomorrow is as pleasant as this evening it will be excellent hiking weather. I will update my journal again as soon as I can.","Hot Springs

Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533763,"When we got up this morning it was raining again. We waited a little while for it to stop then went to the gas station for a breakfast sandwich. Since they didn't have any we went to the diner again. After breakfast we started uphill out of town. We made good time all morning. At lunchtime we stopped at a little campsite. The afternoon was a long, hard 4 mile climb up Bluff Mountain. At the top we started to hear thunder. Soon we were over the top and on our way down. We thought it would be easy going from there but we still had another climb in front of us to get to the shelter. We were lucky enough to get space inside. Just after we arrived it started to pour. All of the tenters came crowding into the shelter and it was difficult to move. We all waited out the storm and then we could cook our dinner. There are more showers expected tonight.","Hot Springs

Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533764,"It rained heavily throughout last night but we were dry in the shelter. The rain was loud on the metal roof and there was a cold wind. When morning came, it was still raining heavily. We stayed in bed for a while and then got up and started packing. After breakfast the rain had stopped and we headed out. Today was mostly a downhill day with many long, steep descents. The highlight of the day was Max Patch, a beautiful, high, windy bald. The views were beautiful. Through most of the day we leapfrogged with a group of college students from Asheville. We lost them sometime after Max Patch. Tonight we are sleeping in our tents. The shelter is almost empty but the floor slants and we have heard talk of a lot of mice at this shelter. We are not expecting rain tonight. Tomorrow we will enter the Smokies.","Walnut Mountain Shelter
",Groundhog Creek Shelter,"May 13, Fri",13.10
Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533765,"Today was just a great day. We got up early. It got very cold through the night. We packed up and started right up Snowbird Mountain. We stopped for breakfast partway up and then continued to climb. Finally we reached the summit, which was a grassy bald with an FAA tower on top. The rest of the morning we hiked down the other side of Snowbird Mountain. We stopped for an early lunch at a little campsite. While we were there, a tree fell on the hillside above us. When we finally reached the bottom of the mountain, we detoured to Standing Bear Hostel. It is a rustic hostel with a bunkhouse, a treehouse and a cabin across the brook. We bought resupply items in their little store, along with frozen pizza and soda. We heated the pizza up in the kitchen and ate the whole thing. Then we packed up our things and headed for the Smokies. Once we got into the park we hiked another mile uphill to the shelter. The shelter is full tonight. We were surprised to find that there are no bear cables. Tomorrow we start our journey through the Smokies.","Groundhog Creek Shelter
",Davenport Gap Shelter,"May 14, Sat",10.50
Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533766,"It was so cold this morning, we delayed getting up. The shelter was full and had a gate with a fence. It was not a comfortable night and I was glad to leave in the morning. We started up Mt. Cammerer and stopped for breakfast about an hour later. It was so cold we only stayed a few minutes before we had to get going. We stopped again about an hour later and finished eating. The hike up the mountain was not too hard and we made pretty good time. Lunch was at a trail intersection near the top. It was very busy with thru hikers, sectioners and dayhikers. We started hearing stories of an aggressive bear following hikers on the trail. Apparently there was a bear trying to get food off the bear cables at the shelter we are at tonight. So far we haven't seen it. The afternoon was pleasant and a little warmer. We spotted some horses at another trail intersection. It was a short day and we got to the shelter early, so got a good spot. The shelter is crowded with 16 people so far in a 12 person shelter. No one wants to sleep outside. A hiker was attacked by a bear in a hammock d down the trail. Many of the hikers here tonight were there when he was attacked. I am hoping we will not run into any bears but it sounds likely that we will.","Davenport Gap Shelter
",Cosby Knob Shelter,"May 15, Sun",7.70
Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533767,"Another chilly night last night. The crowded shelter helped keep us warmer and we had a fire in the fireplace until it burned out. Everyone got up with the sunrise and it was beautiful. We had a short day so we cooked breakfast and had some coffee. One of the weekend hikers left his sleeping bag in the shelter. I'm sure he is missing it tonight. We climbed up Mt. Guyot today. We are much better at uphills and the views were so incredible that it was well worth the climb. We had a pleasant lunch at the Snake Den Ridge Trail intersection and then hiked a little further to the site of an old plane wreck. After that it was a pleasant hike to the shelter. We got here a little after 2:00. It seems a long time to spend at a shelter. The way the Smokies are set up you have to stay in the shelters so you have to decide on a longer day or a short one. We thought about going to the next shelter but that was the last place the bear who has been harassing hikers was seen. We have heard many stories about this bear and it seems to be becoming more aggressive. I hope we won't encounter it. We are running out of fuel for the stove and so are now eating our meals warm instead of hot, and no more coffee. Only one more day on the trail and we will be heading into Gatlinburg to resupply.","Cosby Knob Shelter
",Tri Corner Knob Shelter,"May 16, Mon",7.70
Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533769,"We had some heavy rain during the night and were glad to be in the shelter. This morning it was still raining, but everyone got packed up pretty quickly. Since it was too cold to sit around, we headed out right after breakfast. Although it was a drizzly morning, we made good time. We checked with several northbounders regarding bear sightings and it seemed as if the aggressive bear had moved off the trail. Last night we saw a video and heard an account of a hiker who was at the Pecks Corner Shelter after everyone else had left. He had his food spread out when he spotted the bear coming towards him. He yelled and waved but the bear continued to come towards him. Then he took his gun and fired a round. The bear retreated but not very far. We stopped for lunch today at a beautiful overlook. I'm sure the scenery was beautiful, but we were in a cloud and couldn't see anything. The sun started coming out later in the day and there were many breathtaking views. I slipped on a wet rock during the afternoon and hurt my ankle. I am able to walk on it but it is painful. In spite of that, we hiked up to Charlie's Bunion, a high rock outcropping. Afterward a group of teenage boys with a leader went past us, but shortly afterward we passed them. Apparently they were running low on energy. We just plodded along up the hill to the shelter. They arrived about 20 minutes later to take a break. On the way up the hill we saw a wild boar on the hillside. The shelter is very nice, on the side of the mountain. We had great views at dinner and saw a spectacular sunset. A couple of deer came into camp to graze. The guys have a fire in the fireplace and now it is cold and time for bed.","Tri Corner Knob Shelter

Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534683,"We got up early and headed out of the shelter. We were in great moods because knew we were going to town. On the way down to the gap, we met many dayhikers heading to Charlie's Bunion and a few thru hikers heading on their way. By 9:30, we were at Newfound Gap. After a stop at the bathroom, we started trying to find a ride into Gatlinburg. We tried talking to people, but most were heading to Clingman's Dome. We tried the traditional method of sticking out our thumbs. After about a half hour, a young man and his girlfriend picked us up and drove us to the Quality Inn. We checked in and took showers, then did laundry. After we were presentable, we looked around the town a little. We picked up stove fuel at the NOC, and then went for an early dinner at the Texas Roadhouse. The town is like a carnival with all kinds of ways to get rid of your money. Eventually we returned to our room and watched some TV.","Ice water Springs Shelter

Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534685,"Zero day in Gatlinburg. We had a lot of trouble deciding whether to stay in town another night or head back to the trail in the afternoon and go to the Mt. Collins Shelter. When I noticed it was half a mile off the trail, the decision was made. My ankle appreciated the extra day. We took the trolley to Food City and got our resupply, then went to the restaurant next to the hotel and got a beer. We sat on the deck by the brook and drank our beer. We made a lot of phone calls and watched more TV while we ate our meals from the food store We got to bed late.","Gatlinburg

At 8:00 our shuttle arrived and we headed back to Newfound Gap. Today was mostly uphill and very dreary. We were in a cloud and it was wet, windy and cold. We ate lunch at a little mossy log in a spot that was somewhat sheltered. We were cold and are quickly. Then we started climbing over Mt. Love and up to Clingman's Dome. We hit the highest spot on the AT just before the Clingman's Dome turn off. It was 6,655 feet. We climbed the observation deck but only stayed a few seconds. The wind was gale force and the only thing to see was clouds. At the bottom we talked with some tourists who were very interested in our hike. After that we hustled on down towards the shelter. It was still very windy and raining too. As we got closer, the rain got heavier. We were very glad to see the shelter. It has been pouring for hours now and it's cold. Everyone is wet and going to bed to get warm.","Gatlinburg

Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534692,"The rain and wind last night sounded like a hurricane. Everyone was wet and cold. Every time we had to leave the shelter for anything we got soaked; getting water, using the privy, hanging our food. We cooked and ate standing up because the benches were too wet to sit on. Breezy and I met a girl we had met last year on the trail in Virginia. We took pictures with her and I have her my contact info in case she needs any help when she gets to NJ.Breezy and I were the last people to leave the shelter this morning. It was a wet day and we had our ponchos on all day. The trail was so slippery and wet. It makes it hard to hike because all of the logs, roots and rocks are slick and it's easy to slide. The mud is very slippery too and everything takes extra effort. We had to skip lunch today and just ate a quick snack because there was almost no let up in the rain. We got to our next shelter about 3:00, got water and cooked our dinner. There is a nice fire that the guys built in the fireplace and I am ready for bed.We saw two turkeys today and followed one up the trail for a little while.","Double Spring Gap Shelter

Breezy and I were up early and left with the rest of the shelter still in bed. It was tough going immediately with the wind howling and everything wet and very slippery. I have had several falls already this year and have been getting more and more afraid on the wet trail. The morning was slow going as we climbed to Thunderhead Mountain and Rocky Top. Sure enough, as we climbed I slipped and fell, hitting my head on a rock, skinning my knees and generally jarring my whole body. Breezy was very kind and helped me with my pack and gave me wipes to clean my knees. We got going again, saw some nice views on Rocky Top, and stopped for lunch at a convenient rock. The weather turned nicer after lunch and we took off the pack covers. We passed Spence Field Shelter and Russell Field Shelter, both of which are closed because of bear activity. After a long downhill, we started climbing again. For some reason I had great difficulty getting up that mountain and could hardly breath. Finally we made it to Mollie's Ridge Shelter, cooked dinner, filtered water and sat by the fire for a little while. We are tenting tonight because the shelter is full. All of my bones ache. I feel like I was in a car wreck. Hopefully I will feel better in the morning.","Derrick Knob Shelter

It was cold this morning but soon warmed up, and the sun was out all day. The trail head dried for the most part and the walking was fairly easy. We had dinner uphill today, but mostly downhill. We met up with a group of teenage boys hiking with two adults and we leapfrogged with them through the morning. Before lunch we climbed to the Shuckstack Fire Tower. It was about five stories high and the stairs and landings had only minimal railings. We climbed two stories up and could see for miles. Afterward we stopped at a stream for lunch, and I had a chance to wash some of the mud off my legs. We were looking for a boulder field, but only found a group of rocks called Throne Rock. We were in a hurry to get to the post office before it closed, DJ we spent the afternoon walking quickly down out of the Smokies. At last we saw the road and walked about a mile to the dam. The trail goes right across the dam and it was beautiful. When we got to the Visitors Center, we called for a shuttle to take us to the post office. We picked up our resupply box and then came to the resort. We got a room in the lodge. The pool was open, so we went for a swim. After doing laundry, we went for dinner and then to a campfire and marshmallow roast. This is a very nice resort and it would be fun to come back here.","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535443,"We got up fairly early this morning, packed up and had breakfast out of our resupply box. When we got to the lobby to check out, the shuttle was dropping someone off, so we got an immediate ride back to the Visitors Center. From there we hiked the rest of the way across the dam and down to the Fontana Hilton. Thus is a super luxury shelter with bathrooms, a shower and a phone charging station. When we left there, we hiked through the woods to the marina. We decided it would be a good idea to go out on the dock to the little shop and have some ice cream. It was delicious, and as we were sitting there, three canoes paddled by carrying the group of boys and men we had met near the fire tower! We followed them back to the shore and said hello. Scott gave us his number in Georgia in case we need any help. We started uphill just before noon. It was a long climb today but we did fine. The day was sunny and warm and felt very nice. We stopped for lunch near a stream and then hiked on to the Cable Gap Shelter. We stopped there and ate dinner, then began hiking uphill again. After about 3 more miles we found the campsite we were looking for at Cody Gap. We had trouble with the bear line, as usual, but finally got it hung. Now we are in our tents.

We set off pretty quickly because we knew it would be a hard day. After a short downhill we hiked mostly up steep trails. Finally we reached Brown Fork Gap Shelter. We stopped in there for water and breakfast. Afterwards we hiked on until we came to Jacob's Ladder. This is an extremely steep section of trail. We were lucky that we went down it instead of up, but it was still hard on the legs. We reached Stecoah Gap around noon but since we had a late breakfast, we only stopped for a snack. There is a parking lot and picnic tables, and while we were there, a man drove up and brought bananas. We each had one, as did the other hikers who were there. Finally we started on the final mountain of the day, Cheoah Mountain. It was long and steep. At the top was Cheoah Bald. It was a small bald and was swarming with bugs. We started down to the shelter. It seemed to take a long time to get there. These steep mountains are making my feet and ankle ache terribly. This is a nice shelter and only a few people are here, so we decided to sleep inside tonight. Tomorrow we will be at the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center).

Cassidy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535445,"We set out this morning on a long downhill to the Nantahala River. On the way we saw a large black snake slithering off the trail. These long, steep downhills are very hard on the feet. We finally reached the bottom around noon and arrived at the NOC. It is a real adventure place with all kinds of river sports, zip lines and several stores and restaurants. I stopped in the outfitter to get a replacement Sawyer bottle because mine is leaking but they didn't have any two liter bottles. Since it was raining we decided to go to a little restaurant and have a salad and a beer. We sat by the river to eat and charged our phones at a handy nearby outlet. After lunch we headed up the steep six mile mountain. It was a very hard climb. We finally reached the shelter a little after 7:00. Water was a ways up the hill and took a little while to get it and filter. We met some sectioners going in the same direction when we got to the shelter. They had a nice fire going and we sat at it to filter water and cook. They went to bed before we finished cooking. We ate in the increasing darkness and hung our food by flashlight.

Our plan was to hike to Wesser Bald as have breakfast on the fire tower. The fire tower was not far and we climbed right up it. It had a large sturdy platform at the top and the views were amazing. We made phone calls from the top since we both had cell service. We could see storms moving in, so we climbed back down and head down and have breakfast at the bottom instead. The rest of the day was mild climbs and descents. We stopped for lunch at Cold Spring Shelter, which did have a cold spring right in front of it. We watched the birds scavenging crumbs and two robins having a fight. We moved right along after lunch and reached Wayah Bald Shelter about 4:30. We had to go quite a way for water but once that was done we could relax, make our dinners and watch the sun go down. It is a nice shelter, though small. Four of us are sleeping inside tonight.
