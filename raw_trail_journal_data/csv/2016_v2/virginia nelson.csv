virginia nelson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/451324,"HELLO! I know my very long hike is two years away, but it's never too early to start, right? I think this journal will be a good place for me to put all the research I gather over the next couple of years. Are there any books or websites that have been most helpful to y'all with prepping? Do please let me know!-Virginia","

virginia nelson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/451325,"YELLO!With the weather warming up, I can't wait to get back outside for some overnights. I'm planning on doing 2 nights at Mt. Rogers at the end of May. I really hope to see some horses, and I've heard I could possibly see some foals! Also, it'll be the first time backpacking with a hammock instead of a tent. I'm interested to see how much better I sleep. What's your experience with tent vs. hammock camping?Virginia","

virginia nelson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/451326,"Hello Again--This is my third post in one day because I want to show up in the forum! What are your thoughts about taking technology on the trail? My friend, Jordan, who will be hiking with me, wants to take a kindle book thing. For some reason that just seems fundamentally wrong! Thoughts?Virginia","
