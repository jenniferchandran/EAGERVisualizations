I cannot get hiking the Appalachian Trail out of my head and don't feel I can move on until I finish. I will start out in hopes of doing it all, but will not feel bad if I just become a LASH.

POSTMARK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519093,"Backup and running. I keep kicking things back and forth in my mind. Big dilemma on the plate. I want so to restart my hike and finish it. yet I want to tour on the bike too. Then there is the day to day life that will inevitably make me feel guilty for leaving things for the wife to do. I am not getting younger as is no one else. I am still healthy, which I am thankful for. Now I thinking what I could do is get on the trail, hike to Maine, find a WalMart, buy a bike, and ride back home. Then cut the grass when I get here... :-)  I plan on leaving Harpers Ferry and go north to Maine then come back to Harpers Ferry and go south. I could take a bus, train, plane, or get a bike. I think in order to not make this a year long trip I had better do the Bus. I don't like planes and frankly I haven't looked into the train yet.....",,Restart,"Dec 23, Wed",0
POSTMARK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519092,"I talked to my daughter tonight about the trail. She had stated once that when she retired in 5 years she wanted us to hike the trail together. I cannot put off hiking the trail that long. I would be 65 yo and the chances of me being as healthy as I am now, well lets just say I don't want to chance it. If in 5 years I am still able we will hike it together.  Now , as the title reads, it is the night before Christmas and all through the house only one creature is stirring and it isn't a mouse.

What do I really need. I found a sleeping bag that weighs about half what the one I have does. I guess that will be my purchase first. I have most everything else. I have been searching and finally found a system to recharge my phone without have to plug into an outlet. When I am able i will recharge that way , but I am talking about a system using a standard 9v battery or AA's.  Dragged the ruck sack out of the closet and dusted it off, Patched the mouse holes in the canvas pup tent. I wonder if I should treat it with water repellent.",,Just another Day,"Dec 25, Fri",0
POSTMARK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519090,Was a little worried about the temps that I might encounter in Harpers Ferry for an early April start so I looked up the average and historic temps.

Was going to wait for warmer weather but why put off til tomorrow what can be done today. I have something else to do come April.  I have decided to take my gear with me and after a time take some time and just walk the Katy Trail. the Katy Trail is a rails to trails project that crosses Missouri and parallels the Missouri River. Sure it is flat, 2% grade at best, but it will allow me to take time off and prepare for my hike and test gear.",,Off to Missouri,"Dec 29, Tue",0
POSTMARK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519088,"I find it ironic that a lot of journals I have read state hikers are dropping everything and going on a six month vacation. With my limited experience on the AT it was no vacation. At least not the setting on the beach sipping pina coladas in the summertime type vacation. It is however reminiscent of some of the vacations I have been on. It was a lot of work camping with the family, 50 lb canvas tents, 20lb coolers, sleeping bags of old, etc...  It doesn't get easier the older you get either.  I pulled the plug on my last sleeping bag system that being the three piece military sleeping system. I had three issues with it. Bulky, Heavy, and was not compatible with being a side sleeper. The zippers poked holes in 2 of my air mattresses. I put that system in moth balls and purchased a Mountain Hardware HyperLamina Torch weighing in at 3 lbs 8 oz. Half the weight and equal to the temp rating. The best thing though is going to be that it is a front zipper and should be helpful while sleeping on my side. Now to find somewhere else to cut a little weight. Without breaking the bank. Lastly I wanted to wish everyone a Happy New Year and if you can't be Happy at least make it Merry.",,Happy New year,"Dec 31, Thu",0
POSTMARK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519087,"Got word today that i should wait a week before making my way to the Kansas City area. I won't go into it too much, but we evicted someone and they trashed the house taking all the fixtures and breaking all the windows. It's 2016 3 years of rehabilitation has done a lot of things for me and I will be doing things a little different this time around. Some of the worries I encountered were the things that happen at home while in the woods that I have no control over. My wife is very capable of handling what may come along. I feel bad that she has to cut the grass and all. My neighbors are godsends and I can count on them if she needs help. Doesn't take away from the guilt I sometimes feel though. She says "" you have been doing for everyone else for a year, don't you want to do something for you?"" So we are going to the woods......I hope to see some of you out there. Good luck to all.",,97 Days,"Jan 02, Sat",0
POSTMARK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519086,"Well it's January and that means that it should ship and arrive soon, or so the e-mails say so. I am talking about AWOL's 2016 A.T. Guide. Was over on White Blaze reading as I have been off and on for 4 years now. Have I told you that I love White Blaze. I don't post much but I do read with interest. Thought I would start a Journal so my family and friends could follow along and know where I am on the trail. It's a good idea for them to know and a is also good for me as they will know where to send the goody boxes. Well there are a lot of opinions on where to start and why and I know I have stated that I was going to start in Harpers Ferry, but I will wait until I get the guide and look at it. Then I will make my decision as to where I will begin. I do know it will be in close proximity of Harpers Ferry.  I want to start on April 8th in remembrance of my Mother and if i begin south of Harpers Ferry maybe I can attend the Flip Flop kickoff. Not that I really need or want to but at least I will have that choice and still begin on her birth date. I haven't really told everyone in the family that I am going to return to the trail, but I let slip to one and another is guessing. All I can say is it takes a lot of support from Family and friends, but it takes twice as much for me. I have also got a special kind of woman behind me and frankly I do not know why sometimes she puts up with me.  If you see me on the trail I can be pretty sarcastic but if I could I would carry your pack for you, but I can't so please don't ask. :-) 
Not sure why I am not showing up on the list. Maybe editing or adding an entry might help.",,Awaiting it's arrival,"Jan 04, Mon",0

It weighs less than I carried before and less than the amount of weight I have lost. Now I am going to look at all the items and see If I can pare the weight without lightening the wallet. Probably pack and unpack this at least once of a week.,,94 Days,"Jan 05, Tue",0

I get it set up and I get this invitation to add a friend. My daughter so I add her and I immediately get an invitation to a fitbit challenge from her. She invited me to a step challenge which is a challenge to see who would take the most steps this weekend. She is such a smarty pants. She thinks shes gonna beat me just cuz I am old and can't keep up. I remember when she couldn't keep up. One time in particular, she was about 4 and we were climbing the stairs back up to the parking lot form Tahquamenon Falls in Michigan. I put her on my shoulders and carried her up the 94 steps. I wonder if Ms. Smarty Pants will do the same for me. ( i wouldn't if she said yes ) She doesn't know it yet but when I step foot on the Appalachian Trail April 8th I am going to challenge her to a 6 month step challenge.

POSTMARK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519535,"I went out and walked the Greenway this morning with a bunch of Turkey's. It was kind of cold and windy but I sucked it up and got busy. The woods themselves, this time of year, are not very awe inspiring but still nice to be out there. As I was walking I spotted a flock of what I thought were buzzards. Thought maybe something had died. As I got closer and I could see their features better I could see that they were turkey's. Normally they wouldn't allow you to get this close so I got a pic and continued on. I noticed that every sign post was empty and void of signage. I wonder if the parks department is planning on replacing them or they disappeared by way of vandals. Well I decided that it must be the Parks Department because vandals wouldn't take the time to re-install the screws. We'll see, I am sure I will revisit this greenway in the next 80 or so days fore I leave.",,What the Flock,"Jan 12, Tue",0
POSTMARK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519654,"Wait, I am still going. I just decided on a couple things.  First is my trail name. I have decided, with assistance, to go with POSTMARK. I retired from the Postal Service but was not a Mailman or Postman, per say those tags are mostly associated with carriers. I was a Electronic Technician and fixed the machinery that sorted the mail. I was a behind the scenes guy.  Second is I will be hiking 4 Seamark Ranch.Seamark Ranch is a nurturing Christian home and family system that gives children from families in crisis the tools they need for a brighter future. Through a family home model, a specialized residential school and the lessons of life on a working farm community, Seamark Ranch provides the ideal setting for love, stabilization, healing, education and empowerment.Seamark Ranch is a nonprofit organization established in May 2001. It is tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Seamark Ranch relies almost exclusively on private contributions from individuals, businesses, civic organizations, foundations, and churches for its support. Seamark Ranch maintains a debt-free policy and is building the Ranch as capital is raised. I could have hiked for a lot of causes as others do, but I thought I would do it for a charity that my cousin actually volunteers for. My cousin is so excited about it and that in itself warms my heart. I will also benefit by doing this for Seamark because, as my cousin puts it, I will have 18+ pint size cheerleaders. My Mother, I am sure, won't mind sharing the limelight either as I am sure she would have loved this organization.So if you want to sponsor me write me a little note and I will get you on the list that my cousin is in charge of. Yes she is the admin of this debacle, there has to be a cost for her...right.",,Change of Plans,"Jan 14, Thu",0
POSTMARK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520944,"57 days and a few hours, minutes, and seconds I will set off on my second attempt at a thru hike. I have been in Missouri for a month and some change cleaning up the yard and readying my Mother's house to put on the market. It has been little like I remember it being on the trail, sun up to sun down walking and sleeping on an uncomfortable bed to name a couple. Missouri weather is as fickle as I remember it being along the first part of the trail in Georgia. I finally got my AT guide and have been pouring over it and my first attempts itinerary. I have a lot of work to do in 57 days with this itinerary beings I am going to do the Flip Flop but editing may be better than starting over. TTFN",,57 days,"Feb 10, Wed",0
POSTMARK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521550,"Just an update for those watching. I have decided to connect myself with a cause and try and get sponsors. I am hiking for Seamark Ranch which is a christian based group home for Kids.   I decided to hike for this 501(c) charitable organization because it is one that my cousin volunteers at and seldom gets the acknowledgement, like other charitable organizations get, that they deserve. We have a goal. I have also set up a Hikefor account where you can go and sign up to sponsor me for a per mile donation to be determined at my finish. http://www.hikefor.com/Postmark/AT/2016Nobody can predict what may happen in the future, but hiking for this cause with 18 tiny cheerleaders rooting for me might give me the edge I need to keep going.Thank you in advance for your support.......April 8th i will begin my hike.

POSTMARK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522143,"Actually went on a food run for Seamark Ranch today. Met two wonderful ladies at corporate. Then off to the store where I met Justin. Thought it humorous that he laughed when I shook his hand and called him Mr. Case. It will be a different meaning now when I use that phrase, Just In Case. When we got back I met another special lady that takes care of the pantry, Kathy I believe. Thank you all for being so overwhelmingly kind. Everyone here at the Ranch has been this way and couldn't be more proud to have picked this cause to hike for. Not to mention the Kids yelling out Hi Postmark!, when we arrived to get the van. I am sorry kids that I didn't acknowledge your greeting, but i was focused on what I was doing so as not to forget anything. I was also texting a cook, gourmet, whom has graciously volunteered to cook me some meals and send them to me along my route. I accepted without a fight for, (shes a gourmet chef), she is my cousins friend.Sure makes my heart feel good that there are still good people out there. Time seems to be zooming by as there is never enough time in a day. I still have so many things to do, buy the bus ticket to get me to the trail, renew license plates, fix the lawn mower, etc... Which brings me to the most special person: my Wife, Who is without a doubt the one person who should be thanked for allowing me to leave home for six months while she stoils at all the chores that I should be doing. 39 dayshttp://www.hikefor.com/Postmark/AT/2016",,39 Days,"Feb 29, Mon",0

Today I am going to purchase the bus ticket which will be non refundable. Been watching a lot of you tube in the last week in between walking. Food bag stuffed.

POSTMARK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523679,One more week down before I start again. I stated that I was going to get the bus ticket last entry but because of life's unexpected snafus I wasn't able to. Four bills later the vehicle is fixed and before the fines kick in I should get the plate renewal out of the way. Couple things left to do and maybe I can leave early. Costing fingers on that one.

POSTMARK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523913,"I stopped here a week ago on my way home from Florida. Met a guy that I hope the ranger helped in shaking down his pack. I made an off handed comment about his pack weight and thought I had better go back and apologized. Introduced himself as Thomas and when the ranger asked him if he had a trail name as of yet, he stated Thomas Works. I had planned on hanging some oranges in the trees along the trail but seems the trail goes east and home was west. I'll wait until I get farther north. I went to the MD yesterday and pretty much got an okie dokie from him, but I was to be aware of my symptoms, light head, dehydration, etc... I am taking high blood pressure meds and a diuretic. If I get these symptoms I am to cut back on the amount I am taking. While at the MD, while talking to the nurse, I explained what I was about to do. She got so excited and happy in what I was telling her I was going to do she couldn't wait to tell one of the PA's in the office. She says on the way out the door, He is going to be so jealous. Within 2 minutes a knock on the door and we are talking about the trail and such. Seems he's a hiker too. Probably more than I am. Either way I know you want to and I hope you get enjoyment out of my journal, but I will not change my trail name to PRE-Mark   :-) just because I am going before you. I have been to a lot of Doctors offices in my life and I have to say that this office and the people in it are so special and caring that it makes you want to come for an appointment.",,Everyone knows if they have been to Amicalola SP,"Mar 18, Fri",0

Once I get going I will be able to gauge how many miles I will be able to do in a day. Itinerary is just a guide to help me know where I need to go into town to resupply. I have the gourmet chef in the bullpen just itching to start sending me her delicious dehydrated meals. Who knows if it works out I will get my two cooks on the trail next year and do some trail magic. I have rides to town at strategic road crossings. I am so stoked. Hope to see other flip floppers out there. Looks like I am going to have about 9 days to make Harpers Ferry for the flip flop kickoff.

POSTMARK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525769,"It is raining and has been off and on for a couple days. Bored out of my mind from watching direct tv and it baffles me as to why I am paying for this service. I have resorted to watching you tube videos on the television I get 150 channels of nothing. When I finish the trail there are gonna be some changes. I can get 25 of the channels I am paying for free on my antenna and I will probably get more if I put it up higher. I just have to do a little more research in how to stabilize the antenna when the wind blows so as not to lose the digital signal. With that said, I stated in my last post that I probably wouldn't post again until on the trail, but because of the aforementioned, I had nothing else to do. It is now zero minus 7 days and I will be making my way to Virginia. I am so ready to be on my way. The only thing I am concerned about now is the weather. I have a zero degree sleeping bag and it is only getting down to 28 on April 5 and 6th but that is in the valley. What is it going to be at the top of the mountain? I probably making much ado about nothing but I still worry and wonder, Am I doing the right thing?, or should I wait. Visions of 2013 also come to mind and aren't helping. I weigh less, my pack weighs less (not much but), and I feel better. When the weather gets better after a couple weeks on the trail I will have lost even more weight, i will be able to lessen the pack weight a little more, and by doing that I will feel even better. Everything on the home front is going as well as expected. Not sure what they are going to do if something goes haywire. But we will get through it. I am not going to say this will be my last post before the trail this time. Happy Trails",,Zero minus seven,"Mar 31, Thu",0
POSTMARK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526875,"Well I didn't set an alarm so got a late start. Then I get stuck in traffic in Knoxville. I determined I'd be really late getting the car to Waynesboro so I had to add a day to the car rental. That puts me taking the car back friday. I sure hope the rest of this trip is easier.   So I took a hike up the trail to see what it was like. Beautiful as you can see from the pictures. Now I am back at the motel and watching the weather. I kind of knew it was going to get cold Saturday night Sunday morning. They are saying degrees and snow all day Saturday high 42 with temps dipping to 19 in the valley. That's 10 degrees warmer than up top where the trail is. So I have called a shuttle who is picking me up Saturday morning and taking me south about 10 trail miles, 15 by road, and I will hike North back to the motel. Sunday morning I will get up and start where I left off Saturday. It will be cold in the morning warming to 54 and sunny and the rest of the week looks like 35 is the lowest it will get at night.One thing positive happened today. While trying to find the permits for the Shenandoah National Park and where to put them I stopped to ask a couple hikers if they knew. They looked cold and tired and they had no.idea. I asked if they were waiting for a ride. They said that they called a whole list of people for a shuttle from a list given them by Rockfish Gap Outfitters but everyone was eating dinner, out for they evening or out of town on vacation. Pretty sad shuttlers not wanting to shuttle. So I told them I just came from town but to throw their gear in the car. When I opened my trunk they learned just why I was asking the sort of questions I was asking. In my trunk was a backpack. Their trail names were 60 and 60also.   I told them I was 60 too but that was my age Postmark was the trail name.
