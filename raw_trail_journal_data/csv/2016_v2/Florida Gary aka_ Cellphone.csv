Florida Gary aka: Cellphone,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527870,"Started April 4 from Daleville. Hiked 4 days and exited trail at Thunder Hill Shelter for 3 nights. Returned on April 11 and started at Thunder Hill. I stayed last night in Buena Vista and will be leaving town soon. As you can tell I am not really keeping up this journal, just posting occasionally to keep a little record.","NOBO

Florida Gary aka: Cellphone,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530160,"Arrived in Waynesboro, VA on Monday 4/18. My plan was to still go through the Shenandoah National Park to Front Royal and finish my hike there, but it did not work out. I went to the YMCA to get a shower. I was going to resupply and eat then head on out and not even stay in town. The man at the desk at the Y let me know about the fire. I called the Ranger Station and found out about parts being closed. Anyway, my plans changed. I decided to rent a one-way car and head back to Florida. I ended up with 12 days of hiking and covered around 134 miles. I was pleased to have had one long day of 21.9 miles. Overall there were some very cold days, but I had a great time.","Waynesboro
