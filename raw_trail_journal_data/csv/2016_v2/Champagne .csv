Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551886,"Hello to all who are reading my journal! For those who don't already know me, my name is William Coates. I am 23 years old and was born and raised in Keene, New Hampshire. Currently I live in a small town named Groton up near the White Mountains of New Hampshire with my parents in a beautiful log cabin. I just recently graduated from Keene State College with a BA in Criminal Justice. For many years now, I have desired to become either a police officer or conservation officer for NH Fish & Game. Growing up, I spent a lot of time outdoors between playing soccer, hunting with my dad, fishing with my grandfather, or hiking the popular Mt. Monadnock. However, I never had a real interest in backpacking until my dad introduced me to it in the White Mountains. During my sophomore year of college, he took me on my first backpacking trip in the Whites and by the end I wanted more. We are currently working on hiking the 48 4,000ft or higher peaks in the White Mountains. We both have 50% of them done, with 24 in the bag.During our first trip is when I first found out about the Appalachian Trail. I had heard the name before but I didn't know anything about it like where it started, ended, how long it was, or how people went about hiking it. We happened to be hiking a section of the Appalachian Trail on our first trip in the Whites and there were several thru-hikers on the trail headed towards Maine at the time. We happened to stay at the same location as some of them one night and were able to meet a few who would ultimately convince me that I should hike the AT as soon as I was able. Throughout the next couple days we would leapfrog back and forth with Mecca, Yukon, K-Bar, and Redfoot as we headed towards the end of our 5 day trip and they continued on for Katahdin. On many occasions we ended up taking breaks or summiting peaks at the same time as the crew of thru-hikers and were able to talk with them about their journey's. More than once, they each told me that I should really consider hiking the AT once I finished school and before I jumped into a career. Many said that it had been the most incredible experience they had ever been through, filled with both high and low points. On the last day of my hike with my dad, we had hiked ahead of the AT'ers and made it out of the woods. We went and stayed at a nearby inn and decided that the next morning we would get up, go get an assortment of goodies at Dunkin' Donuts and bring them to where we had exited the woods, as would the thru-hikers in order to cross a road and continue up through the White Mountains. We set up the coffee and donuts and waited for them to exit the trail. After a couple hours, they started to emerge from the woods. We called them over as they came out and invited them to help themselves to the snacks we had brought for them. Unexpectedly, they all sat, ate and drank their coffee, and stayed for awhile to chat before we parted ways. We had expected them to hurry on in order to put in some big miles for the day. Needless to say, we were pleasantly surprised that they stuck around. The hikers informed us that we had just become trail angels. (For those of you who don't know what a trail angel is, basically they are normal, everyday people who thru-hikers encounter along the way to their destination. These people can do anything from leave a cooler with soda's in it on the side of the trail, give hikers rides into town to resupply, or even give the hikers a place to shower, eat a hot, home-cooked meal, and sleep for the night. Pretty much anything that someone does that is unexpected and aids the hiker in some way will earn them the title of trail angel.) After talking with us some more about what they had overcome and what they still had to conquer ahead, K-Bar, Yukon, Redfoot, and Mecca prepared to set back out on the trail. We asked them if we could take a photo of them all together before they departed to which they agreed. We watched as they headed down the road towards the trail and then proceeded to head home once they were out of sight. Several weeks later, we saw that they had all successfully completed their treks across the AT. I will never forget my first trip in the Whites and having the opportunity to talk to all the hikers along the Appalachian Trail. They are undoubtedly the reason why I am setting out to attempt my own thru-hike in March. Throughout my own journey, I hope I have an opportunity to be as influential to someone as they were to me.",,A Little Information About Myself,"Nov 27, Sun",0
Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551904,"Several weeks ago I was scrolling through my Instagram feed and happened to come across a photo with a caption talking about the Vasque Thru-Hike Syndicate. The Thru-Hike Syndicate is a collaboration of outdoor companies who select a set number of hikers who will be setting out to attempt to hike a long trail and supply them with gear throughout their hike. The hiker, if they should accept, acts as a brand ambassador for the companies which make up the Thru-Hike Syndicate (Vasque, Osprey, NEMO Equipment, Leki, Lifeproof, and Darn Tough). The Syndicate has supported hikers since 2014 and was recently accepting applications from hikers to be selected for the upcoming year. I went ahead and sent in an application thinking ""what the hell, why not?"" Well, a few days ago I got an email saying that I was 1 of 15 people who were being selected to represent the 6 companies. I couldn't believe it when I saw the email pop into my inbox. I never thought that I would be selected for such a great opportunity and I couldn't be more excited to be able to represent all of these amazing companies while on the Appalachian Trail.",,Thru-Hike Syndicate,"Nov 28, Mon",0
Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551919,"After waiting going on 4 years, I am 120 days away from setting foot on the trail. It still seems so far away but I know I'll be heading down to Georgia in no time. These next 4 months will be busy and filled with planning, collecting the remaining gear I need, speaking with the companies that make up the Thru-Hike Syndicate, and all around preparing for my trek across the AT. I am growing more excited everyday and I find myself thinking about the Appalachian Trail more frequently than ever before. I can't wait!",,120 Days,"Nov 28, Mon",0
Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551959,"Zealand is my 1 year old black labrador retriever. She was named after one of the 4,000ft mountains in the Whites. She is an amazing dog and she loves to hike with my dad and I when we go in the White Mountains. I usually hike up front while my dad stays behind me and Zealand tends to stay somewhere in-between us. At times when my dad and I get any significant distance between us Zealand will constantly run back and forth between us to check in and make sure we are both doing okay. When I first got Zealand, I had plans to take her on the AT with me. I bought her a ruffwear backpack so she could carry her own food and water while we were hiking. She would make a great companion to have with me and I would love to be able to say that she completed the entire AT along my side. Once I started reading more about the trail and having a dog with you I decided it would be in her best interest if she stayed home. As much as I would love for her to come along, I don't want to take the risk of her contracting lyme disease or possibly getting injured. I've read that the ticks along the trail can be a serious problem. Due to her color, it can be incredibly difficult to find the nasty little parasites if they attach to her. I have spoken with other AT'ers who have either had dogs or seen other hikers with dogs on the trail. Many of them seem to have the same thoughts regarding dogs on the trail. As nice as they are to have as a companion along the trail, they can make completing the AT even more difficult than it already is and many dogs get sent home along the way.Other than the issue of ticks, there are sections of the trail where dogs are not allowed, including the final section in Baxter State Park. This requires you to place your dog into someone else's care when you reach a section where they are not allowed. As much as I wanted to take Zealand with me, I know leaving her at home is for her own good. She gets to hike with me plenty when we go for day trips and backpacking trips for 3 or 4 days at a time. It is definitely going to be difficult not having her with me and getting to see her everyday. I have not been away from her for any extended period of time since I got her. I am hopeful that I will get to see her if my parents happen to come visit me somewhere out on the trail.",,Zealand,"Nov 29, Tue",0
Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551971,"Today I spent several hours to begin planning a tentative itinerary for my start on the AT. I didn't realize how much time or work it would take to plan out my starting points, ending points, mileage and resupplies for each day. I started doing it in a notebook and after a while I figured it would be much easier to create a ""numbers"" file (same thing as excel for windows) on my Mac. As of now, my plans go out 189 miles from Amicolola Falls State Park in Georgia where I will start my journey to Russell Field Shelter which is 14.5 miles from Fontana Dam, North Carolina. In my spreadsheet I have my starting point for each day, my desired ending point for each day, the number of miles between my starting and ending point, total mileage since the start of my hike, any resupply areas I intend to go to, and notes on what areas have water sources, shelters (which I don't intend on using but setting up my hammock nearby), food sources, and towns. So far I have found benefits to creating an itinerary but I have also found drawbacks. By doing this it allows me to see what I would like to accomplish each day, where I will be able to get water and resupply, and where I can find shelter. Another plus to doing this is that my file saves to icloud and allows me to access it from my phone. By doing this I can look at information about the trail without having to carry any extra hard copies of notes. One of the drawbacks I see about this method are that it is very time consuming but could be worth my time now and save me time on the trail. Even more of a drawback, if on any day I don't follow my itinerary (such as taking a zero day or doing more/less miles than planned) it will completely throw off everything I have planned. For now, I plan to continue filling out my spreadsheet over the coming months. If anyone has recommendations or experience regarding this please feel free to let me know. If you think its a good idea or think its a complete waste of time I'd love to hear back. The only alternative to this that I can come up with is going day by day on the trail. I have a copy of the Thru-Hiker's Companion which I intend on bringing with me regardless of any planning I do ahead of time. I also have the Thru-Hiker's Companion App on my phone which shows detailed maps of the trail as well as where you can get water, where there are shelters, and where you can resupply along the trail.",,Trail Planning,"Nov 29, Tue",0
Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552148,"Last Friday I went on a short hike to the summit of Mt. Cardigan in Canaan, NH with Zealand. It was my first hike since moving back in August and it was very much needed. I took West Ridge Trail, the most direct trail to the summit, which is 1.5 miles. The gate across the dirt road leading to the trailhead was closed for the winter which added another 1.2 miles roundtrip. My total trip distance was 4.6 miles which took a total of 1 hour and 36 minutes of actual hiking time with an average pace of 2.7mph. Total elapsed time came out to 2 hours and 29 minutes. Elevation gain was 1,509ft. Not bad for my first hike in a few months.After walking the road to the trailhead there was a nice parking area with several picnic tables and a covered shelter area. There was a bulletin board which listed a map of the area as well as the trail work reports by the Dartmouth Outing Club for this year. The list of work done to the trails was extensive and as a co-adopter of a trail in the White Mountains, I was impressed by how much work had been done. The work they had completed throughout the year was certainly noticeable throughout my hike and made for a much more pleasurable experience. Right from the start the trail started climbing in elevation. It would continue to do so for most of the hike with few flat areas which did not last long. Due to its short length and needed elevation gain to the summit, most of the trail ascended. I think it will make a good training mountain and I will be hiking it more before I start the AT. For the first half of my hike the ground was soft, wet, and muddy. As elevation was gained, the ground became covered in thin patches of ice and snow. There were points where micro-spikes would have been beneficial but I decided to not use the ones that I had brought with me. As the summit neared, the trees began to thin out and the wind picked up quite a bit. For the last 0.4 miles or so, the trail turned into bare sheets of rock and followed large rock cairns to the summit. By the time we got to the summit, I estimated that the wind was blowing somewhere in the high 40's to mid 50's. Zealand and I explored the summit a bit, took in the exceptional views that were offered which overlooked the surrounding area, took some pictures, and then proceeded to hike back down the mountain. All in all it was a great hike. Zealand and I enjoyed getting outside and doing what we love.",,Mt. Cardigan,"Dec 05, Mon",0
Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552483,"Ever since I started letting people know of my plans to take on the Appalachian Trail in 2017 I have been asked a lot of questions, many of which are the same from different people. I thought it would be a good idea to write about the questions I have received and what my typical answers are to the people who ask them. Question 1) When are you leaving and how long will it take?Answer 1) I plan to leave in March of 2017. The trail covers 2,190.3 miles across 14 states from Georgia to Maine. I will be starting at Amicalola Falls State Park in Georgia and hiking towards Mt. Katahdin in Maine. I expect my trip to take anywhere from 5-6 months. Question 2) Who is going to be hiking with you?Answer 2) No one is going with me. I plan to start my hike alone. Many people who hike the AT start alone but ultimately end up with a group of people who hike at the same pace and have similar goals to reach for each day. Over 2,000 people attempt to hike the AT each year so it is often crowded at the start and it is rare to not see other people on the trail. Question 3) How are you going to get food on the trail?Answer 3) Hikers have two options to get supplies on the trail. Many hikers do ""mail drops"" where someone from back home ships a box of supplies that you put together before you begin your hike to a town along the trail. Other hikers plan to stop into town every 4-6 days to buy food and any other needed supplies from grocery and convenient stores which is what I will be doing. Question 4) Are you going to carry a gun for protection against bears and other people?Answer 4) No... The people who hike the AT are some of the most wonderful, caring, and kind people you'll ever have the pleasure of meeting. As far as bears go, any gun that I would be able to carry with me along the trail probably wouldn't be able to stop a bear anyway. It would just end up being extra weight I'd have to carry in my already heavy pack. Question 5) Why do you want to hike the AT? (This is by far the hardest question to answer. This is not what I have been telling people because it is difficult for me to explain without putting it in writing so I figured this would be a good place to write it.)Answer 5) There are a lot of reasons why I want to hike the AT. My biggest reason is that for the first time in my life I am free to do what I want. For the past 18 years of my life I have been going to school. In the last 4 years I have been going to college and working 20-28 hours a week. I have never done something extraordinary, for myself. Sure, I graduated college which is something a lot of people don't have the chance to do, but I did it because it was somewhat expected of me and I knew it would help me down the road. I have never really traveled, I have never left the country, I have never completed an amazing feat. Now that my education is finally completed, I am free. Free to experience what life has to offer. Free to do what I enjoy. Free to travel. Free to escape from what society expects young people my age to do which is finish school, jump into a career and get stuck in the same routine for the next 30-40 years. ""The trail isn't going anywhere,"" they say. That may be true, but you never know what is going to happen in the future. You don't know what your health will be like in the future. You don't know that you'll be capable of completing over 2,000 miles in the wilderness after you retire. In this gap between graduating from college and jumping into a career, I plan to do as much as possible to live a fulfilling life and to create memories that will last a lifetime. The AT is the start to that life.",,Common Questions,"Dec 16, Fri",0
Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552548,"This afternoon I took some time to figure out what the base weight of my pack was going to be. The weight I calculated does not include water, food or the items I will be wearing for most of my hike. I have been hesitant to do this because it is very likely that my pack weight will be changing before I depart for my hike. As a member of the 2017 Thru-hike Syndicate, I will be receiving gear from Vasque, Opsrey, Leki, Nemo Equipment, Darn Tough, and Lifeproof. As of now, I am not sure what gear they will be sending me but I expect it to change the weight of my pack, for the better. After looking at what other syndicate members have received in the past, I believe I will also receive new hiking shoes/boots, a backpack, trekking poles, tent, sleeping bag, socks, and a case for my phone. Other than getting new gear from the companies who make up the Thru-hike Syndicate, I am also considering changing some of my own gear and leaving some items at home. To get around the issue of my pack weight changing, I added up everything that I would be carrying if I were to leave tomorrow and I also added up everything I could potentially be carrying when I leave in March.Pack Weight Now: Sleeping Gear:Eno Hammock: 6.5ozEno Tarp: 22ozEno Bug Net: 16ozEno Hammock Straps: 5.7ozSea to Summit Liner: 9.3ozTherm-a-Rest Pad: 10ozEMS Sleeping Bag: 42.5ozJacks R Better Underquilt: 22.5ozPack:Osprey Atmos 65 AG: 70ozSea to Summit Compression Sacks: 12.5ozOsprey Hydration Reservoir: 10.8ozOsprey Pack Cover: 3ozCookware:GSI Outdoors Cookset: 10.9ozKatadyn Vario Water Filter: 18ozMSR Pocket Rocket: 3ozMSR Isopro Fuel: 14.8ozClothing:Outdoor Research Rain Jacket: 15.4ozEddie Bauer Down Jacket: 12.2ozOther Misc.

Charging Cables: 2oz (Estimated)First Aid Kit: 8oz (Estimated)Thru-Hikers' Companion Book: 5oz (Estimated)Total Weight: 22.16lbs I'm fairly content with this weight but it could definitely be lessened by a few pounds.If I end up receiving a tent from Nemo Equipment, I am planning on carrying both my hammock system as well as the tent. Some people would say that is unnecessary but the added weight of the tent would be so minimal that I think it would be worth it to have the ability to throw a hammock up or set up a tent. Potential Pack Weight (Including gear from Syndicate companies):Sleeping Gear:Eno Hammock: 6.5ozEno Tarp: 22ozEno Bug Net: 16ozEno Straps: 5.7ozTherm-a-Rest Pad: 10ozJacks R Better Underquilt: 22.5ozNemo Equipment Sleeping Bag: 33ozNemo Equipment Tent: 32ozPack:Osprey Exos 48: 36.96ozSea to Summit Compression Sacks: 12.5ozOsprey Hydration Reservoir: 10.8ozCookware:GSI OutdoorsCookset: 10.9ozSawyer Squeeze Filter: 3ozMSR Pocket Rocket: 3ozMSR Isopro Fuel: 14.8ozClothing:Outdoor Research Rain Jacket: 15.4ozEddie Bauer Down Jacket: 12.16ozOther Misc.

Charging Cables: 2oz (Estimated)First Aid Kit: 8oz (Estimated)Thru Hikers' Companion: 5oz (Estimated)Total Weight: 20.3lbsEven while carrying both a tent and a hammock system, my pack weight comes in at less than what I currently would be carrying. Of course this weight is only speculation based on the gear I am likely to receive. If I were to ditch my hammock system and only carry a tent, my pack weight would come out to 15.76lbs. The benefit of carrying a hammock system is that I get a much better night of sleep in my hammock than I have ever gotten in a tent. I feel that a good night of rest every night will leave me feeling rested and ready for the next days challenges. A hammock also allows me to set-up nearly anywhere that I want. 
 As far as food goes, I plan on carrying roughly 2lbs of food/day with resupplies every 4-5 days. I should be looking at roughly 8-10lbs of food at a time. For water, I plan to carry 2L in my hydration bag as well as 1L to cook with at night if necessary. With water weighing 2.2lbs/liter I am looking at 4.4-6.6lbs of water. With food and water, 16.6lbs can be added to my pack weight, maximum.",,Pack Weight,"Dec 20, Tue",0
Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553123,"All through my school career, I had more than a few teachers and professors at all levels of education start off their classes on the first day by having the students do one simple task. This was to pull out a piece of paper, a pen, and to write down a few things that you would like to take away from your time in the class. Looking back at this, I now realize I always thought of it as simple, but tedious, task asked of us by our teachers that was just used as another ice-breaker. As the date of departure for the trail nears closer everyday, I have found that I am thinking more about what I want to take away from my time on the Applachian Trail and perhaps that task which was required by so many teachers was more than just an ice-breaker but instead used as a way to make yourself realize what you wanted to work for most. One of the first things I would like to take away from the AT is patience. I imagine that by having to walk to every destination you wish to reach you have no choice but to develop patience as it will take more time than ever to get where you want to go. For as long as I can remember I have been in a rush. Been in a rush to grow up. Been in a rush to finish school. Been in a rush to get where I am going when I'm driving. When I was 12, I just wanted to be 16 so I could drive. Once I was 16, I wanted to be 18 so I would feel more like an adult with more freedom. Once I was 18, I couldn't wait to be 21. When I was in high school I couldn't wait to finish and move on to college. Once I was in college I couldn't graduate fast enough so I could go get ""my real job,"" which would eventually turn into wanting to hike the AT. When I get stuck behind someone who is driving slow I get irritated. I now know this is not a healthy way to live. I am in hopes that I will leave the trail no longer wishing to rush my life away but to find appreciation, and joy in what life has to offer here, and now.The next two take aways from the trail I hope for are perseverance and dedication. More than once I have set out to complete something and ended up giving up on it whether it was playing soccer, ultimate frisbee, learning to play the guitar, or going to the gym regularly. I have quit most of these things due to giving up when the going got tough, from my own laziness, or just loss of interest all together. I know already that there are going to be tough times on the AT. There are going to be days when I hurt physically or that I miss being at home. There will be days where it has rained day after day and I am soaking wet, cold, and ready to quit. Advice from other successful thru's has been to never quit on a bad day. Take a rest day to think about things. Eat a big breakfast after a good nights sleep and really think about it before making the decision to get off the trail. More people than not regret their decision to quit when it is made on a bad day. I hope this mindset will stick with me throughout and long after my completion of the trail. I'm sure this list will grow in the coming months and even more so once I hit the trail but for now I think these are three important traits worth working towards during my time in the woods.",,The Trail Provides,"Jan 09, Mon",0
Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553367,"After finding discrepancies in weights for certain pieces of gear I began to lose my trust in manufacturers ability to list actual weights for their products on their webpages which is how I calculated my gear weight in one of my previous entries. On top of this issue, many pieces of my gear did not have listed weights. Yesterday I bought a kitchen scale that allows me to weigh all my gear myself. I have now weighed every piece of gear that I will be bringing with me on the trail and used a site called lighterpack.com to make an easy to read chart.",,Pack Weight... Again,"Jan 16, Mon",0
Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553754,"Gear from the Thru-Hike Syndicate companies has begun to arrive! After some brief emails back and forth with a representative of NEMO Equipment I am now in possession of some gear that has been tried, tested, and put through the wringer by many other successful through-hikers before me. Yesterday I received the Hornet 1P Ultralight Backpacking Tent, as well as a Nocturne 15 Downtek Sleeping Bag, and a Tensor 20R Mummy Sleeping Pad from NEMO Equipment.All of these pieces of equipment have been graciously given out to members of the Thru-Hike Syndicate in years past and they have withstood the beatings that our gear will undoubtedly take as we trek across nearly 2,200 miles. I am excited to put them to the test myself in a few short months. Now that I have these new pieces of gear I have made the final decision to take both my ENO Sub7 Hammock as well as the NEMO Hornet 1P Tent. I have already prepared myself for the lectures I am sure to receive from people that I meet along the trail. Many people will not be able to wrap their heads around the idea of carrying not one, but two shelter systems for the length of the trail. My justification for doing so is that I will be able to enjoy the best of both worlds by carrying the two. If I want to throw up my hammock in the middle of the wilderness, I can. If I want to set up my tent on top of a bald mountain and watch the sunset and the sunrise in the morning, I can. There is no place on the AT that I will not be able to set up camp for the night. I am so looking forward to having the option of what I want to sleep in every night.",,NEMO Equipment ,"Jan 24, Tue",0
Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554359,"Since I started planning my trip along the AT, I have been against doing mail drops in order to get my supplies. The whole idea of mail drops seemed completely unnecessary to me and I thought they would take away from the overall experience of living in the moment while on the trail. Well, a few days back I stumbled upon an article on ""The Trek"" that has since changed my mind about mail drops. The article is titled ""The Best Towns to Send Mail Drops on the Appalachian Trail"" and it goes over 6 towns along the AT that although aren't necessary for a successful thru, have proven to be some of the best and most helpful to send some food and supplies to along the AT. After reading the article, I decided it would be in my best interest to send some food to these locations as well as one other that I deemed necessary. The 6 locations mentioned in the article are 1) Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC), 2) Fontana Village, 3) Bland, VA, 4) Harper's Ferry, WV, 5) Caratunk, ME, and 6) Monson, ME. Along with these drop locations, I will be adding Neel Gap. The article goes over why each of these locations are ideal for sending a drop box to which vary for each location. Some of the reasons are that these places are noticeably more expensive than most other locations along the trail, the selection of food available is minimal, or that they are the last place that you can resupply for a long section of the trail such as Fontana Village where you will enter the Smokies shortly thereafter or Monson, ME where you will need to resupply before entering the 100-Mile Wilderness. This afternoon I made a quick trip to the local Walmart and purchased some poptarts, oatmeal, granola bars, ramen, pasta sides, tuna packets, and a few backpacker meals. I expect these to be some of the things that I will be eating along most of the trail as they are light and easy to prepare for meals. Some things will be still have to picked up to go along with what I send myself but for the most part these supply drops should get me through the sections of trail where they are being sent. I'll be heading back to the supermarket to pick up the remaining food I need to complete my last 3 drops. For most of the AT I will be heading into nearby towns in order to get my supplies for the trail.  Here is the link to the article I am speaking about for any of you who are interested or are on the fence about doing mail drops yourself. Perhaps it will change your mind too.",,Mail Drops,"Feb 08, Wed",0
Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555423,"Only 26 days to go before my dad and I head down to Georgia to begin our journey along the AT. I'm hopeful that this month will pass by quickly as the trail consumes my thoughts on most days and I am more excited than ever to get started. I don't think I have gone a day without thinking about the AT in quite some time now. I've gotten to the point where I wake up wishing I was rolling out of my hammock and hitting the trail rather than crawling out of bed and getting ready for work. Springer-fever has undoubtedly set in. With less than a month to go, I have almost all my gear together and finalized with the exception of a few items. I received my Vasque boots about two weeks ago and have worn them almost everyday since I got them to break them in and to be sure they will serve me well on the trail. So far, so good. I have no complaints about them so far. They are comfortable, light, provide good support and traction. Blisters have been a big concern of mine as I have gotten some of the worst blisters some people have ever seen. I haven't gotten any while wearing the Vasque Breeze III's, yet. Unfortunately, I am still waiting to receive my backpack from Osprey, hiking poles from Leki, socks from Darn Tough, and a case for my phone from Lifeproof. With so little time remaining before I take off for the trail, I am hopeful that these items will be sent out soon so I can test them out before I leave. Aside from the remaining gear I need from the Thru-Hike Syndicate companies, I still need to purchase some compression sacks to store my gear in, a longer spork for my cookset, and a stickpic to use on my trekking poles for my GoPro. I will be purchasing all of these items at the end of this week and then it will just be a waiting game until I get the rest of my gear. The countdown is on.",,Getting Antsy ,"Mar 01, Wed",0

Most of my gear is already in Osprey dry bags so hopefully the cover won't be necessary but I figured it couldn't hurt to have some extra protection from the elements. Plus, it'll stop my bag from absorbing rain and becoming heavier. The decision to go with the Atmos AG 65 did not come easily. I originally wanted to use the Exos 58 which is 2lbs lighter than the Atmos but after filling my dad's Atmos with all the gear I will be taking with me I realized that I would need the extra 7 liters of space to fit everything. The plus side of the Atmos is that it is extremely comfortable compared to other bags I've used even it is is a bit heavier. I received my trek poles from Leki as well. I chose the Micro Vario Ti Cor-Tec poles. I bought my mom a set of these for Christmas and she loves them. After messing around with them myself I figured they would do well on the AT. They're incredibly sturdy and very lightweight. After hearing that my dad was going to be hiking the AT as well, they even sent out a second pair of the same poles for him to use. Due to their generosity, I will definitely be a Leki customer for the remainder of my hiking days. I got to pick out 5 sets of socks from Darn Tough. They have some really cool designs for their socks, even one made specifically for the AT so I obviously had to get a pair of those. I've been wearing them for the last couple days and I've got to say they are by far the most comfortable socks I've ever worn. They have so much padding in the places where it is needed most. I'm really looking forward to pairing these socks with my Injinji liners and seeing how my feet hold up on the AT. With any luck at all I will have minimal blistering. Finally, Lifeproof sent me a couple of their cases for the iPhone 7 Plus. With two options to pick from, I went with the Nuud edition. So far I love the case. It adds so much protection to my phone and I am no longer afraid to drop it or get it wet. It's submergible in up to 2 feet of water for up to an hour. Probably more protection than I need but its better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it. I happened to shatter the screen of my phone in Boston before I got a case during the Patriots Super Bowl against the Falcons this year (sorry to those of you down in Georgia... it was one hell of a game) and know all to well about the pain of breaking a phone. No need to worry any longer. So, thank you to all of the companies participating in the Thru-Hike Syndicate this year. I can't even begin to express how grateful I am to be part of such an amazing opportunity. You have all sent me some of the best gear available and I can't wait to put it to the test in a few short days.",,Ready to Go,"Mar 22, Wed",0
Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557363,"Well, today was my last day of work with the New Hampshire Liquor Commission, for now at least. I've held this job for nearly the last 4 years, roughly the same amount of time that I've known I wanted to hike the AT. Thankfully I have been able to secure my position with the Commission and it'll be available to me when I get back from the trail given that I want to continue working there. I've met some really great people while working with the Liquor Commission, some of which I now consider to be lifelong friends. If you guys are reading this, you know who you are. I'll be looking forward to seeing you again once I get back from the trail. But, enough about work. If you've been following along with my entries you have probably seen me mention that my dad is going to be attempting a thru this year as well. A few months back my dad, who also worked for the State of NH but as a cyber security architect, realized the State was headed in a direction he was no longer interested in. He resigned after putting in 10 years with the State, began looking for another job in the private sector and throughout his search realized he now had what would most likely be his only opportunity to give the AT a try. He's always been the outdoorsy type. He's been a hiker and backpacker for years and is now a region leader for the adopt-a-trail program in the White Mountains. A few years ago, he turned me on to the whole backpacking thing and has since made me realize how passionate I am about spending time in the woods and mountains. If it weren't for him, I probably never would've even considered hiking the AT, so thank you dad. Needless to say, I'm excited to experience all that is the AT right alongside him. Originally, I had wanted this to be a journey that I went about on my own, and I'm sure there will be places along the trail where we each want to do our own thing, but for now we are planning on starting at the same time and setting up camp in the same places and I am looking forward to doing so. Plans as of now are that my dad will be starting each morning earlier than I will be. He is an early riser and is likely to put some distance between us before I crawl out of bed. Prior to bed the night before we will have discussed our stopping point for the following day and throughout the day I will most likely catch up, pass, and reach our destination before him where I will be waiting for his arrival. Sounds good in theory, hopefully all will go as planned. My dad also has a journal here on TJ.

Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557772,"Yesterday was an emotional day for my family. My mom, dubbed ""the quartermaster"" by my dad, is staying back at home in NH to take care of the house, our 3 dogs, Ollie, Tess, and Zealand, and our 2 cats, Cooper and Phil. As my mom and I hugged and said goodbye I began to tear up. It was more difficult than I thought it would be to say bye to someone you wouldn't be seeing for the next 4 months or so. Then came the part I knew was going to suck. Saying goodbye to Zealand. I brought her out to our deck, played one last game of tug-of-war (of course I had to let her win), threw her a couple snowballs, and gave her a big hug. The waterworks really started at this point. Somewhat embarrassed, I stayed out on the deck with Z until I was able to pull myself together and dry my eyes. Words can't even begin to describe how much I'm going to miss that dog. She has brought me so much joy in the short amount of time that I have had her. My dad and I then put on our packs, took some pictures and headed out the door. Needless to say, it was hard for my mom to watch us take those final steps out our front door and into the rental car that we had all gone to pick up in Concord. She is strong and I know that after a few days, if not already, she will be fine. Aside from taking care of the house, my mom has the important duty of shipping my mail drops as well as my dads, which we are very appreciative of her willingness to do. We hope you are doing well mom! We love you! Remember, it's not goodbye, it's see you later.  As I write this, my dad and I are headed down to Georgia. We ended up leaving yesterday, a day earlier than expected, due to the likelihood of getting some freezing rain in New Hampshire today. We left at around 2pm yesterday in order to get ahead of the storm. From NH we headed a short way over to our neighboring state of Vermont where we drove through a small section of The Green Mountains, or ""hills"" as my dad referred to them. From VT we headed down into New York and then into Pennsylvania where we drove through the Delaware Water Gap and contemplated spending the night in the car but ultimately ended up driving a bit further until we found a questionable Inn that turned out to be 3.6 miles from the AT. After entering our room, we promptly checked our beds for any signs of creepy crawlies such as bed bugs, something I have yet to have experience and I'd like it to remain so. No signs of anything but I ended up choosing to take out my sleeping bag from my pack and sleeping in that rather than under the covers and blanket of the bed. About 2 hours after falling asleep, I woke up sweating, I climbed out of my sleeping bag and draped it over me as a blanket. Turns out a sleeping bag rated for 15 degrees isn't such a great sleeping option in a room that is 70 degrees. It was at this point that I realized I would've rather already been out on the AT and sleeping in the woods. This morning my dad and I were both up a little before 7. We took some quick showers, got ready and were out door before 8. We headed a short distance down the road where we stopped at a Dunkin Donuts. We both got a coffee and a breakfast sandwich to take on the road. I don't know what it is about the Dunkin Donuts' in PA but they can't even get the simplest of orders correct. First, they forgot to make us our coffees, then they made me the wrong coffee. The last time we were in PA, we had gone to the exact same Dunkin's and the crew there couldn't speak a word of English and our orders were all wrong. But, no need to bicker about the lack of quality in customer service. After our stop we were back on the road to begin our 650 mile drive for the day to Asheville, NC where we will be spending the night tonight. My dad and I are now on the edge of the state line separating Pennsylvania and Maryland. It has been a nice drive this morning, we've been listening to a live Grateful Dead show from 1972 in Veneta Oregon that I have downloaded on my phone, and it appears we have found Spring. It's currently 52 degrees, the grass is green, and buds are appearing on bushes and trees. I'm looking forward to the rest of our drive and working our way south. Right now, I am as far south as I have ever been and I'm excited to get to North Carolina.",,Headed Down to Georgia ,"Mar 27, Mon",0
Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557944,"Yesterday was a long day in the car but it was nice to close in on Georgia. After crossing through Pennsylvania and Maryland we hit West Virgina for a short while and then headed in to Virginia. It felt like it took forever to get through...We caught a taste of the ""Virginia Blues."" After Virginia we went through Tennessee for a few miles and then it was on to North Carolina where we had a hotel room reserved for the night. It was mostly an uneventful day but it was nice to take in some scenery of places that I have never been to before. For most of the trip down we were in close vicinity of the AT and were able to catch a glimpse at some of the mountains that we will be traversing over the next several months. I've gotta say, my favorite state so far has been North Carolina. It seems to be similar to New Hampshire in terms of terrain and it is definitely the only place we crossed through that I would ever consider living in. After getting in to NC we headed to Asheville and checked in to our room at the Best Western. After what we had stayed in the night before, this placed seemed like paradise. 2 large beds with 4 pillows each and comfortable bedding. I didn't even feel the need to check for bugs this time around. After hanging in the room for a bit we decided it was time for dinner. We found ourselves at Applebee's for some fresh cooked meals and a beer which was quite a treat after living on fast food and convenient store subs up until that point. After dinner it was back to the room and off to bed for an early rise in the morning. I woke up at around 6:30 and hopped in the shower after checking my phone for a few minutes. Dad had already showered and appeared to be ready to go. We sat around in the room till about 8:30 and then hit the road. Before long we were driving through the Great Smokey Mountains. It was easy to see where they got their name from. Mist and fog engulfed the mountain tops and hovered just above the road. It was a cool sight to see and I'm really looking forward to walking through some misty mountains. It's a feeling you can't get anywhere else when you're walking through a forest that is blanketed with fog so thick you can't see 20ft in front of you. It's eerie and creepy but so cool at the same time. After driving through the Smokies we entered in to Franklin which is a planned stop for both my dad and I to resupply on food once on the trail. From Franklin it was down in to Georgia where we drove to Gainesville and then to our final destination of Oakwood. We arrived at the hotel, another Best Western, which is even better than the one from last night and they let us check in to the room about 4 hours earlier than we were supposed to. My dad then ran over to Enterprise and returned the rental car. After hanging out in the room for a bit we walked a short ways over to a post office to send some stuff from the journey back home. Having not eaten yet, we went down to Hardee's, what I assume to be a southern fast food chain, and got some delicious chicken, fries and poppers. It was fantastic and the workers there were very kind. I guess southern hospitality holds some truth. Coming from New Hampshire, a place that's as cold as the people who live in it, it's nice and warming to see people who have genuine smiles on their faces, who greet you, ask how you are doing and care about the response that is given back to them, and say hello or wave at random. After lunch, we took a quick jaunt to the Aldi's across the street from the hotel. That was an adventure in and of itself. To get there we had to cross 6 lanes of highway and apparently the cross walks in Georgia don't work all that well. On our way back, we had the ""ok to cross"" signal and as we headed across the street a green light appeared on the stoplight above us and traffic began barreling towards us. We picked up our pace and we're able to make it across unscathed.Now, I am sitting and relaxing in the room just waiting to get started on this epic adventure. Our shuttle man called not long ago and asked if he could change our pick-up time from 9am to 7:30am. Abso-friggin-lutely. Let's get this show on the road. Tomorrow I will be hitting the approach trail while my dad heads to Springer. I'll be meeting him at the top and then we will continue on to Long Creek Falls for the night.  *Line of travel in photo is not 100% accurate",,Finally in Georgia ,"Mar 28, Tue",0
Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558109,"Day 1 on the Appalachian TrailMarch 29Total Miles: 14. 1 Miles from Springer: 5.2 (All posts after this will be based on miles from Springer) I woke up this morning ready to roll. I was out of bed a little after 5:30am and began getting everything ready to leave the hotel. After a short shower, I packed my bag one last time before heading out. Thinking it would be a good idea to eat some food before making our way to the trail, I tried to choke down some of the remaining chicken lo mein that I had leftover from the night before. I didn't have much success in my quest to take in some calories before starting my journey on the AT. As a result, I ended up taking a short break to eat some food about 4 miles in to the approach trail, but more on that later. Expecting our shuttle driver to be at the hotel by 7:30, my dad and I made sure we were out of the room, checked out, and waiting outside by quarter past. 7:30 rolled around and there had been no sign of our ride yet. No biggie, there was a beautiful Georgia sunrise coming up directly in front of where we were waiting outside and it was a perfect way to start the day. Antsy and a bit nervous, I used the sunrise to my advantage and focused on that until a few minutes past 8 when our shuttle driver arrived. My dad and I hopped in and we were off. On our way to Amicalola falls my dad and our driver chatted which mostly consisted of politics. Not my forte so I remained quiet in the backseat. 45 minutes later, I was hopping out of the car and making my way inside the visitor center at Amicalola Falls.I walked in, signed my name as wells as my dads in the registry and made my way out the back door towards the archway. Here, I met 3 other thru hikers who happened to be from Germany. I would leapfrog with them back and forth until the top of Springer. We each volunteered to take each other's pictures in front of the archway. After snapping some pics we were off. I don't tend to be much of a small talker so I allowed the 3 to get some distance ahead of me instead of walking with them. I ended up sitting at a picnic table not far from the start and gave my mom a call to let her know I was on the trail. She was beyond excited for me as she knew that I had a smile on my face spreading from ear to ear. She was right. I was ecstatic to finally be on my way. After talking for a few minutes we said our goodbyes and I continued on my way towards the dreaded stair case. That smile I had on my face, yeah that didn't last long. It was quickly replaced by a stern and determined look. I trudged my way up the steps and tried to make short work of them. No such luck. The staircase took me about an hour to complete due to taking short breaks after every few sections of steps. Although it was difficult, the views of the falls were stunning. The way the water crashed down off the initial drop and then tumbled down through the rocks was mesmerizing to watch. After the stairs it was on to a regular dirt trail. It was very much welcomed as I had had enough stairs for one day. To my surprise, the approach trail didn't get much easier from there. I pushed on for another mile and realized it was going to take me longer than expected to finish the approach. I sent out a quick text to my dad to let him know as he was waiting for me at the top of Springer. After that I continued on about another mile and a half. I stopped to have some food for a bit thinking it would help me push through this climb. I was right, and after having a poptart, a few slices of pepperoni, a granola bar, and some craisins, I was making quick work of the trail. Speeding along, I eventually hit another wall. My pace had dropped dramatically. I began playing some music off my phone and I used the power of classic rock to get back I the groove. Before long, I was cruising through the trail yet again. I even found myself whistling and singing along to some Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Doobie Bros, and Jerry Garcia. Pretty soon I was at the base of Springer and had a final 1.5 mile push up to the top. 40 minutes later I was there and arrived to cheering and clapping by a group of people who my dad had been chatting with at the top while he was waiting for me. I laughed, walked over, and sat down in the circle that everyone was in. We chatted for a while and then my dad and I were headed down Springer and to our first stop on the AT which would be along Creek Falls. My dad and I were going at a quick pace on the way down from the peak of Springer. He had fresh legs after waiting for me for so long and I was hopped up on adrenaline from summiting the southern terminus of the AT. I couldn't believe I was finally on the actual trail. As we cruised down the mountain I began to notice that my feet were extremely hot and I knew right then and there I was going to have blisters by the time we got to our stop. At that time, my feet didn't feel too bad so I continued on. We passed through some very cool rhododendron forests that were towering up on each side of the trail and branched over our heads towards each other to make what looked like a tunnel. It was neat and I've never seen anything like it. AT about 2.5 miles down from Springer I noticed that my I was getting some chaffing in between my legs. I have never had this issue before while hiking and I now know everyone's pain who has ever had chafing before. Let metell you, its not fun. I made the mistake of touching a chaffed area with my finger and it burned like a thousand hot needles all pricking me at the same time. Not expecting to have any issue, I didn't pack anything to take care of it. Thankfully my dad would let me use some of his gold bond once we got to camp. I'll be picking some up at our first stop. The last 2.6 miles before camp were an absolute grind even though it was all mostly flat or downhill. My feet were burning up and blistering, my groin area was on fire as well, and my shoulders and traps felt like they just spent an entire day at the gym doing shrugs for 7.5 hours. I began to slow my pace and it was crawling until we finally rolled in to Long Creek Falls. When we arrived, my dad scoped out a pretty slick camp spot across the creek where no one else would go. Turns out, we're the only ones at Long Creek tonight. There were some day hikers with kids here playing in the falls earlier but they left well before dark. We quickly set up camp, I opted for my tent so I could sprawl out and try to aid my chaffing. We each filtered some water and got right to cooking dinner. Due to my long day, I treated myself with a backpacker pantry meal made for 2. It was fettuccine with chicken and an alfredo sauce. Absolutely delicious. I had the entire thing gone within 15 minutes and felt full as ever. After dinner it was on to blister treatment. I currently have 4 blisters on my left foot and 1 on my right. I'll spare you the details on how I take care of them because it's kinda gross. By this time is was about to get dark so my dad hung out good bags on his bear line so I wouldn't have to take mine out and he started a very small fire. We sat around that for a while and then we were off to bed. Its currently 9:30pm and I'm feeling pretty beat up and wiped out. At the moment I'm actually contemplating sending home my hammock system to shed some weight. My packs seems to be a little on the heavy side and by getting rid of the hammock system I would lose about 5lbs. Depending on my chaffing situation, we may be hanging out here for the day tomorrow. Given that it's only been one day, I would really prefer that doesn't happen but it's better than making my chaffing worse and not being able to move at all. Once it goes away, I will be taking every precaution possible to avoid it occurring again. Despite the current physical pain, it's been a damn good day. I'm stoked to be on out on the trail. Spirits are high and it's going to take a helluva lot more than some blisters, sore shoulders and chaffing to take me off the trail.","Amicalola Falls

I woke up to the sounds of a running creek which had soothed me to bed the night before. There were also birds chirping away as if saying ""it's time to get up and get movin'."" I laid in bed and thought about how crazy it was that I was on the AT. I imagine this feeling will last for a month or so before it starts to fade and hiking everyday feels like the norm. After laying still for a bit I checked over my blisters and my chaffing. Everything was feeling good this morning for the most part. I began to do the morning breakdown of my gear. First was the sleeping bag, then the sleeping pad, and finally the tent. It was around 7:45 by the time I had finished putting my stuff away. Then it was on to some more blister treatment. I wrapped all my toes in tape as well as covered any areas that had blisters from yesterday. After dealing with blisters all your life, you eventually figure out what works best for you to prevent them further. None of the toes I taped yesterday morning had blisters... I should've have wrapped all of them in the first place. Oh well, I'll take it as a learning experience. I opted not to eat right away and took some food out from my bag and stowed it for easy access while hiking along the trail. We headed out of camp at 9. Later than we would've liked but we will get quicker. The trail was pretty easy going for most of the day. We stopped at Hawk Mountain Shelter to get some water. We met a very nice ridge-runner who was there taking a break. He informed us on what the trail was like up ahead and that there would be no water for the next 7 miles unless the Army Rangers had set up their water tank at Cooper Gap. After chatting awhile we started back down the trail and shortly came to Horse Gap. I sat there for a bit and had a tuna fish and pepperoni wrap on sundried tomato and basil with hot sauce. While stopped, I took some time to take of my boots and air my feet out. They were in rough shape and I had earned a few more blisters, one of which was a blood blister coming up under my right pinky toenail. My pace slowed to a crawl and thoughts began entering my head of being forced off trail due to the severity of my feet. My biggest fear of the entire AT was becoming a reality. Sassafrass Mountain was the next obstacle in the way. The climb wasn't too bad. It was slightly uphill and had several switchbacks which eased the battle. After coming down Sassafras, I arrived in Cooper Gap. My dad decided to take a rest on top of the mountain so I waited for him at the bottom. The rangers' water tank was sitting in the parking lot so I took the opportunity to fill up my bottles. A little while after my dad came strolling in. We ended up setting up camp at Cooper Gap which was a mere 6.9 miles from where we started this morning. I'm feeling a bit down and unsatisfied with the miles we put in today. I would've liked to keep going but my feet have only gotten worse with each step. I'm sitting in my hammock now trying to rest them back in to shape. It's been difficult to keep the thoughts of ""maybe this long distance hiking thing isn't for you"" out of my head. For now I'm going to press on. The only way I'll get off trail is if my blisters get to the point where I can't physically walk any longer or if they get infected. My chaffing has gotten much better and I adjusted my pack so it wasn't riding on my shoulders. 2 out of 3 issues gone.","Long Creek Falls

Rolled in just as dad and I were heading to bed around 8:30. Heavy rain mixed with some lightning and thunder. Definitely the worst storm I've been out in the woods for. It was interesting to say the least. I made the mistake of hanging my tarp too low to my hammock and once the rain picked up the tarp was about 4 inches away from my face. Every time I picked my head up I would hit it and I could feel the wetness on the underside of the tarp on my face. It was unpleasant but it was my own mistake. I woke up around 6:30 and the storm had passed. I could hear turkeys gobbling off in the distance and for a moment it brought me back home. We have a flock of probably close to 30 that come through our yard several times a day. It's quite the scene to see. The usual takedown occurred and I was out of camp a little after 8. This morning I told my dad I was going to push to Neel Gap and get there as soon as possible. I will wait for him there and give my feet some time to recover. Right off the bat I was climbing. We had stopped just before Justus Mt. It was a quick climb to the top and then I was on my way downhill for a while. Since I was going to be by myself for the day, I popped in my earbuds and cranked up some tunes. First song that came on was ""My Body"" by Young The Giant. The songs chorus goes ""My body tells me no! But I won't quit, cuz I want more."" I felt it was an appropriate song to come on at the time since I've been struggling against myself and it describes exactly how I'm feeling. I won't quit. I came out here to experience the trail and that's what I'm gonna do. To tell the truth, I think music is what got me through the day today. I've always known it was a powerful type of art. You can find music for any emotion you're feeling at any given time and it can make you feel better or do the complete opposite and pull you down. It truly pushed me through the day today and helped me forget about any pain I was feeling. Before long I was heading up Ramrock Mt. It was a steep, but short climb and offered a good view from the top. Some people I had met were at the top having a snack and enjoying the view. I stopped for a minute to chat, eat a smashed poptart, and then I was on my way down the Mt. I was making short work of the trail and soon came to Woody Gap. I crossed the highway and headed up the steepest and longest climb of the day. It was well worth it because at the top, the best view the AT had to offer up until this point was waiting for me. At the top I met a young married couple. The husbands dad was hiking with them too. It was cool to meet another person who was hiking with their dad however, I instantly felt bad about leaving my dad behind. After summiting it was a short hike, maybe 2.5 miles or so to Lance Creek where I decided to spend the night. I arrived in Lance Creek around 3. I couldn't be happier with the miles I went in the time that I did today. It was a damn good day, was a lot less painful then yesterday, and I've met some cool people here at Lance that will be spending the night as well. I'm looking forward to spending time with some other people and possible making some new friends out on the trail.","Cooper Gap

Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558479,"Day 4 on the Appalachian TrailApril 1Miles Today: 7.5Total Miles: 31.4I quit the trail this morning. I hiked back to Woody Gap and caught a ride in to town. From there I took the bus to Atlanta and plan to fly home to New Hampshire... Did I get ya? April Fools! Still on the trail and doing well. The rest of last night was really enjoyable. There were probably around 20 of us all camped out at Lance Creek and everyone was grouping up and having a good time. What brought everyone together was quite comical. This girl, now known as ""Ontrak"" was helping another hiker get his tracphone set up. She offered to call customer support and speak to someone. After spending several minutes dealing with an automated voice system on the other end, she finally got through to a real human being. By this point, everyone was huddled around waiting to see what would happen. The person that ended up on the other end of the line was obviously not a US citizen and communication between the two was difficult and humorous. To top it off, the cell reception where we were all standing was pitiful at best. After numerous tries to relay information to each other on how to get this tracphone set up, they eventually got it figured out after about a half hour but it didn't come easily. Language barriers and lousy reception were easily the hardest obstacles that were overcome yesterday. The plan of attack, like most people I camped with last night, was to get an early start and push for Neel Gap which was only a 7.4 mile hike. However, we had the highest point of the AT in Georgia, Blood Mountain, standing in our way. To add to the challenge, the section just ahead of us, Jarrad Gap, marks the section of trail where a bear canister is required. No one has one.. so we had no choice but to push our way over the Blood. It was my earliest start yet on the AT this morning. I was up at 6am, had everything packed and ready to go by 6:45 and was headed up the trail by 7:15. I was able to catch my first sunrise while hiking and it was absolutely stunning. I stopped for a few minutes and just stood on the trail as I watched the sun creep up over the mountainous horizon. It was a great start to what would end up being the best day on the AT so far. After watching the sunrise I continued to push forward and climb over several little knolls until I got to Jarrad Gap. As I approached the gap I saw several hikers who were just taking down their tents from the night before. It was a good feeling knowing that I had gotten up, broken down my gear, and pushed on 2.5 miles before most other hikers had taken down their setup. After Jarrad, I knew I would be climbing uphill for the next several hours. I checked my water and made sure I was set to climb up and over Blood Mountain. After climbing a ways up I ran into Joe and Murph, two guys that my dad and I had met previously. When I caught up to them they mentioned that they were going to try and grab a cabin at Blood Mountain Cabins for the night. They offered for my dad and I to join in. Appreciative of the offer, I accepted. We all began our climb up Blood. About half way up the mountain I decided to give the Cabin office a call to try and book a room for us. I was disappointed at the response from the desk worker, Matt, who said they were full up for the night. Kinda bummed, I continued up the mountain and made the summit at around 11am. The trail up Blood wasn't anywhere near as difficult as it was hyped up to be. I didn't stop the entire way up and was feeling good about my progress. Shortly after summiting, I got a voicemail from Matt saying they just had a cancellation. After listening to the voicemail, Joe and Murph arrived and I asked them if they wanted me to call back and book the room. Of course they said yes, and within a few minutes we had a 4 person cabin waiting for us at the bottom of Blood. It was shaping up to be a good day. We sat at the top of the mountain and took in the views for awhile. They were impressive and none of us wanted to start our way down. Eventually we got to it, and we're down the mountain by 1pm. On the way down, we crossed paths with what seemed like endless amounts of day hikers. You could tell it was a Saturday with the amount of people on their way up the mountain. We eventually got down and arrived in Neel Gap. We were all thrilled to be walking out of the Blood Mountain Wilderness and that we were reaching the first major milestone of the trail at 31 miles in. There was a lone Natty Ice sitting on one of the picnic tables when we walked in and a thru-hiker from last year told us we could have it. Joe quickly picked it up and instantly asked, ""can I shotgun it?"" To which I replied, ""that's the only way to do it."" He punched a hole in the can and had the beer down in seconds. Pretty sweet trail magic. After having the beer, we all went inside to grab our mail drops and pick up a few other items we needed. Joe and I each grabbed a frozen pizza and the workers at Neel cooked them up for us. We proceeded to eat our whole pizzas without issue. We then walked down to the cabins, checked in and got our key. First order of business when we got to our cabin was to gather our dirty laundry and bring it back to the office. Within a few hours, our laundry returned clean. Joe and I made the decision to hitch a ride down the road a few miles to go to a convenient store to get some beer. After thumbing it a few minutes we were on our way to the store. We each grabbed a 6 pack of highlife pounders and grabbed some food for dinner and breakfast. Loaded with goodies from the store, we stuck our thumbs out again and shortly had a ride back to the Cabin. When we got back, my dad had arrived at the cabin and we caught up a bit on how the last two days had been since I hadn't scene him since Thursday morning. Everything had gone well for the both of us and we were both glad to be relaxing in our own cozy cabin. The rest of the night was filled with conversation, consumption of beer, and listening to music. It was much needed and allowed us to take a break from the trail. Joe and Murph will be heading off in the morning while my dad hang out and spend another day and night at the cabin. We each have things we want to send home and I'm waiting for another package that will arrive on Monday.","Lance Creek

Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558480,"Day 5 on the Appalachian Trail April 2Miles Today: 0Total Miles: 31.4Today was my first zero day. Given that I'm only 31 miles into the trail I'm a little disappointed to be taking a zero but my feet could use some time to recover. I decided to ditch my hammock system and a few other items that would lessen the weight of my pack. So far I have been pretty content with my pack weight and I've still been able to put in the same miles as people who have much lighter packs. The decrease in weight will definitely make things easier for me and I think it will help my feet as well. Joe cooked up some delicious 3 meat and scrambled egg breakfast burritos this morning. They were fantastic and I put down 2 of them. Typically I can't stand eggs but these were absolutely delicious. After breakfast, everyone showered and Joe and Murph got their packs ready to go. A little after noon we all walked up to Neel. We said farewell to Joe and Murph for now but my dad and I are hoping we can catch back up to them in a few days. They're some cool guys who I wouldn't mind hiking with some more. We seem to have the same pace and we all get along great. It'd be awesome to get a little group of people together to spend the days with out on the AT. I've found that it's much more enjoyable to group up with others at the end of the day and talk about how everyone's hikes have been going as well as other topics of discussion. My dad will be taking off for the trail tomorrow morning. I have to stick around at Neel to get my package and then I'll be playing catch up to him. I should be able to catch him in the same day and we will set up camp in the same place tomorrow night. I'm really looking forward to getting back out on the trail after having a day and a half to rest up. I'm having a great time so far and I can't wait to see what lies ahead on the trail. This truly is a once in a lifetime experience and I'm loving every bit.","Mountain Crossing at Neel Gap

I waited around at Neel Gap from 11am when we checked out of our cabin until 5pm for my package from back home to arrive. It never showed up.. So now I'm about a half mile up the hill past Neel Gap hoping that the weather remains somewhat tolerable. Earlier today it was pouring and it looked like it was going to be a nasty night. The weather has since gotten better and the rain has stopped for now. Thanks to my package not arriving I was forced to do another zero day. Now I have to go back down to Neel Gap in the morning and wait from 10-12 when they typically get their shipments in and pray that mine shows up. Not much to talk about today. Overall I'm pretty irritated but there's nothing I can do about it so I might as well get over it. Tomorrow is another day. I just want to get back to hiking...","Mountain Crossing at Neel Gap

I knew my package wouldn't be showing up until at least 10am so there was no rush to get up this morning. My tent did extremely well in the storm last night. I was very impressed to see that there was no water inside when I woke up. The winds were so strong that I thought the rain would've been able to sneak inside. So far, I couldn't be any happier with the Nemo 1p Hornet. If it wasn't so great, I don't think I would've been willing to send me hammock system home. Other than the late start, the morning ritual remained the same. My gear was broken down quickly and I found myself patiently sitting around until 10am. I walked the half mile down to Neel Gap and asked if they had my package yet. I was surprised to hear that it had actually showed up just before they closed last night... lucky me, stood around from 11-5pm and it showed up just after I left. Go figure. Oh well, no harm done. Once I got it, I was on my way back to where I had left my gear. When I got back, Dad was just leaving. We headed up the trail and away from Neel Gap. I was ecstatic to be moving along on the trail again and getting away from Neel's. A short while in, I got a text from Joe saying he had a reservation at the Budget Inn in Hiawasee on the 6th and that my dad and I were welcome to join if we arrived in time. Something to think about tomorrow for sure but I'm not sure we will be there in time. Cutting back the miles to below 10 for a while seems like a good idea to remain healthy. After responding to Joe we climbed up over Levelland Mountain, Wolf Laurel Mountain, and Cowrock Mountain. All were fairly easy climbs that were about 500ft in elevation. Pretty simple hiking today. At the bottom of Cowrock mountain I came across my first bit of real trail magic. Two men had set up tables with all sorts of snacks and cold soda's in a cooler. I helped myself to a Coke and had it down seconds later. It was a hot day with the sun beating down on me for all of it given the late start. That Coke hit the spot. They left shortly after and maybe 25 minutes later two guys my age pulled up in their truck and instantly asked, ""who wants a beer."" Of course I said yes and was handed and ice cold PBR. It was the most delicious thing I tasted all day. We stood around in the parking lot and chatted with the other thru-hikers there. One of the trail angels who gave me the beer thru-hiked last year. His name was Fried Chicken. Shortly after, my dad came down the mountain and they asked him if he'd like one too. He accepted as well and enjoyed his PBR just as I did. After our beers we headed up the last climb for the day up out of Hogpen Gap. We travelled a bit further and my dad found a good place to set up his hammock. I continued on about another 10th of a mile to find a good spot for my tent. I had everything set up for the night within 20 minutes of getting to my spot then had dinner. Grilled chicken in a tomato wrap with mayo, mustard and hot sauce. After dinner, I walked back up to my dads camp spot with 2 High Life 16oz cans I've been carrying since our stay at the Blood Cabins (originally it was 3 but I drank one earlier) and asked if he'd want one with dinner. We proceeded to sit on the nearest log and finish both while chatting for a while. After the beer I walked back down to my tent and prepared for bed. It's now 8:15 and just getting dark. Hoping for good weather through the night as we're supposed to get some more storms tomorrow and Thursday. Will definitely be trying to get up and having my stuff down and packed before the rain begins.","Mountain Crossing at Neel Gap

Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558866,"Day 8 on the Appalachian TrailApril 5Miles Today: 8.7Total Miles: 47.9I woke up to my dad walking into my campsite around 7am this morning. Unsure of who, or what, it was at the time I jumped right up. My dad must of heard me because right after he said, ""it's just me bud."" I instantly relaxed and laid back down for a few minutes. After I got out of my tent, my dad was on his way. I broke down and was on trail shortly after 8am. The trail was super easy today. Most of it followed along what seemed like an old walking path or maybe even a railroad. Climbs were gradual and took place over long distances. Soon after I began hiking, the rain began to come down. I was really enjoying the cool weather and rain as it was soothing the sunburn I got on my arms, face and neck yesterday while hiking in the direct sunlight. At about mile 3.7 we stopped at Low Gap Shelter and made up a quick mountain house meal that my dad wanted to make. It was Mac n Cheese and it was delicious. After walking in the rain for a few miles it hit the spot and really warmed me up. With no end in sight for the rain, I decided this would be an opportune time to put my rain jacket on and try to dry out my shirt over the next few miles. The trail continued to follow the same grade it had before. Slowly but steadily climbing in elevation. It was real nice hiking and would've been perfect had it not been raining. A little past 1pm we reached our goal of chatahochee gap. Turns out this wasn't the best place to set up camp. Essentially it's on a ridge line and the winds are so strong coming up one side and then blowing back down the other. Setting up my tent was nearly impossible with the winds and I almost lost both my tent and its rain cover. Between rain getting in my tent while setting it up, getting in it while soaked and changing, and the wind being so strong that it's pushing my rain cover into the side of my tent, my tent is pretty much soaked. It's gonna be a long night and it's only 4pm as I'm writing this. Hopefully things go well but we're expecting more storms coming in tonight around 9 or 10. The current one hasn't even ended yet. Good news! I heard from Joe today. Him and Murph bailed at Unicoi Gap and grabbed a room at the Hiawassee Budget Inn where they will be staying tonight and taking a zero tomorrow. He sent me the number to the Inn and I called to see if they had any rooms available for tomorrow night. Only 1 room left so I took it instantly. Currently my dad and I are 4.7 miles from Unicoi where the Inn will pick us up and bring us to Hiawassee for free. So even with some crap weather tonight, we will have that to look forward to and will be able to dry out our gear throughout the day tomorrow. Best part is, the 4 of us will all be starting back up at the same time and will be able to do some more hiking together. Knowing that I'll be able to charge up my devices tomorrow at the Inn, I will be passing the time today in my tent by listening to some classic rock. It's hard to be in a bad mood when you're listening to some of the greatest music ever made. Side note from the trail. I'm missing Zealand a whole lot at this point. I've been looking at pictures of her on my phone and it's making matters even worse. I'm already looking forward to being reunited with her when I get back home. When I call home, my mom puts me on speakerphone so I can talk to her. When she hears my voice she instantly starts barking and looking to the front door to see if I'm on my way in. I'd love to be cuddled up with her on the couch or in bed right about now.","Hogpen Gap

Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559190,"Day 9 on the Appalachian Trail April 6Miles Today: 4.7 Total Miles: 52.6Last night was absolutely crazy. The storm was far worse than I ever expected it to be. Things had died down for most of the afternoon and early in the night. Winds were slower and the rain had reduced to a trickle and had stopped completely at some points. Come 10pm or so, things took a turn for the worse. Wind speeds had to have been 50mph at least and the rain was coming down heavy. Our campsite was less than ideal. Since it was called Chatahochee Gap we were expecting it to be a low elevation and in between two mountains like every other Gap we've come across so far. It ended up being the perfect location for the wind to blow directly up into my tent. I had gotten to sleep sometime around 9pm when things had died down. I was hoping that I would just sleep through the night and through the storm. Good joke.. I woke up shortly after at 10/10:30 to my tent folding in half on top of me and the heaviest downpour of rain I've ever experienced. I had to sit in my tent and literally hold the walls and roof so my tent would stay open. Anytime I let go the whole thing folded right back in on me. The wind was so powerful it ripped my fly stakes right out of the ground and I nearly lost my rain fly. Then came the lightning and thunder. The lightning was so bright it lit up my entire tent as if I had a spotlight shining inside of it. Thunder followed not even a second after the lightning flashes. The storm was directly on top of me and for the first time in my life, I was actually afraid to be outside. As the wind died down, I tried my hardest to fall back asleep to make the night pass quicker. It was a losing battle and I woke every half hour or so to sounds of thunder and wind. It probably goes without saying but, my entire tent was soaked inside which included my sleeping bag, sleeping pad, and myself. It was a night from hell and I was half expecting a large branch to fall from one of the trees above me and land on top of me to make matters even worse or to put me out of my misery. Eventually I was able to get to sleep and ride out the night. I couldn't tell you what time it was that I actually fell asleep but it was quite early in the morning. I woke up around 6:30 or so. The wind had switched directions and was coming up the other side of the ridge line. It blew the vestibule part of my rainfly right out of the ground and exposed my pack and my boots to the rain. Now everything was completely soaked. Temps had gone down significantly and what was originally just a shitty night, was now a potentially life or death situation. Cold weather + wet gear and clothes is not good. I wasted no time and switched in to the last dry set of clothing I had, put on my drenched boots and began breaking down my gear. Was on the trail right at 8 and was headed up and over Blue Mountain. I was surprised to see that the trail began to look familiar to trails at home. It consisted of long sections of boulder slides and rocky terrain. Not exactly ideal given the weather conditions but it spiced up the trail a bit since almost the entire day prior was a simple walking path. As I headed up in elevation, it began to snow. I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing. I was convinced that I wouldn't see snow on the entire trip except for the Smokies or towards the end of the trip in the Whites or in Maine. It blew my mind. The snow was short lived however and it turned into a mixture of freezing rain and sleet. Knowing that I had a warm room waiting for me a short few miles away, I was completely content with being pelted in the face by freezing rain. As I made the summit of Blue Mountain, I yelled aloud, ""Is this all you got AT?"" ""You're gonna have to do better than that."" I've figured it out. All of these things that we perceive to be negative experiences are tests of your physical strength and willpower. Every time you're tested with something such as gear issues, physical pain, weather conditions or any other number of things that can go wrong, you're being tested and each time you're tested you become stronger both physically and mentally. After having this realization on the trail, I was cruising my way through the day and singing songs out loud to myself as I made my way down the trail, all the while being hit in the face by freezing rain. I was having a grand time. Before I knew it, I was at Unicoi Gap waiting for my shuttle into Hiawassee. My dad showed up a little while after me and we waited around in the parking lot for about an hour. We saw the shuttle pull in and we proceeded to throw our gear in the back and hop in. The heat was on and it didn't take long to warm up. Several other hikers piled in and we were soon on our way to the Inn we had made reservations for. After a 10 mile drive or so, we arrived and checked in. While talking to the owner of the Inn, I heard a familiar voice call my name. I turned around and I saw Joe. I was excited to see him and he offered for my dad and I to come hang out in his room while ours was being cleaned. Of course we accepted and we headed to his room. Inside was Murph doing another one of his gear-splosions where he takes literally every piece of gear out of his pack, spreads it out on the floor, and goes through each and every piece to determine what is still necessary and what he can get rid of. It's interesting to watch, and now having seen it a few times, my dad and I have picked up on its usefulness and have begun doing it ourselves. After doing some catching up, I went to see if our room was ready. It was, and it was the one right next to Joe and Murph. Awesome! After getting our key to our room it was time to get down to business. Everything was wet so we took up every inch of our room by spreading our gear out and hanging it up. We cranked the heater in our room all the way up and before long it was unbearable hot. I decided to leave and go hang in Joe and Murph's room while our stuff dried out. My dad left to go to the store and get some fresh veggies for a salad that he's been craving. He came back with all the fixings and whipped a ginormous salad. He brought enough back for me to have one too so I made one and enjoyed every last bit.We hung out in our extremely hot room for a while and Murph came by to let us know a bunch of hikers were going to the local BBQ restaurant to get dinner. We joined in and we had quite the crew together at dinner. It was so awesome! It's amazing how the trail brings all these people together and we were able to all sit down, have dinner together, chat, laugh, and tell stories with each other. If I wasn't on the trail, I would never even consider going to dinner with a bunch of people I barely know. Dinner was delicious, I had a 1/2lb burger on Texas french toast with a side of fries. After dinner a few people went to get groceries. Joe and I opted to head to the convenient store to pick up some beer. I got 2 24oz High Life's and a he grabbed 1 since he had a box of wine back in his room. We went back, cracked our beers and began the night which was once again filled with music, conversation and laughter between Joe, Murph, my dad, and myself. It topped off what was a pretty amazing day and made me forget about how brutal the night was before. It's the bad things on the trail that make the good things that much better. Joe and Murph will be heading off for the trail in the morning while my dad and I hang in Hiawassee to get some supplies, finish drying out our gear, and really dial in our packs.","Chatahoochee Gap

Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559199,"Day 10 on the Appalachian TrailApril 7Miles Today: 0Total Miles: 52.6I slept in till 8am this morning. It was great, and very refreshing knowing that I could sleep in a bit and not rush to get gear ready and start heading down the trail. Just about everything in the room was dry by the time I woke up. We probably could have gone without the extra day but it ended up being well used. A long shower started my day off right. Following my shower, I broke out my guide book and determined how many days it would be till we got to the next town for resupply which would be Franklin, NC. I came up with 6-7 days from Unicoi Gap where we will be starting back at tomorrow morning. Could be less, definitely won't be more than 7. Hardest part of the 7 days will most likely be tomorrow morning when we have to climb up nearly 3,000ft right off the bat. After determining how many days, I went through my food bag and figured out what I would need at the grocery store. Dinners were all set. I had more than I needed. The extra 6 ramens I had went to the hiker box. Originally I planned to have a ramen every day for lunch. I've decided that I don't want to stop and take the time to cook a lunch. Wraps with tuna are easier and faster. Before long, my dad and I were off to Ingles, a grocery store. I walked through the aisles and perused at the great selection of resupply options. I went with poptarts, granola bars and slim jims for breakfast and wraps with tuna or salmon packets for lunch. Both of these options have been working well so far on the trail. After picking out resupply food, we went over to the deli where they will whip up food for you. I got a 12"" Italian sub that put any sub I've ever gotten from subway to shame. It was massive and had nearly everything you can put on a sandwich on it. We walked back to our room and I devoured my entire sub. Feeing stuffed afterwards, I sat down on my bed and began thinking about purchasing a tarp/poncho. It made perfect sense and had 4 different uses. Multi-use items are crucial on the trail and this one ended up being a no brainer. This tarp/poncho would allow me to 1) setup my tent underneath it so it will stay dry until I'm able to get my rainfly on 2) wear it as a poncho 3) use it as a footprint for my tent and 4) use it as an alternative shelter system. I walked over to the Mountain Crossings outfitter and picked one up for $100. Should be well worth it if I put it to use like I expect to. The afternoon was completely free and to pass the time I went through my entire pack. I had bought a bunch of ziplock bags at Ingles to organize my gear a bit better and lump my breakfasts and snacks into individual, daily baggies that I can just reach in and grab every morning rather than sift through my bag looking for what I want. After going through my bag and organizing I ran over to Rite-Aid and grabbed a muscle roller, some sunscreen and a bottle of melatonin to help me sleep better at night. Since then, I've just been hanging out and working on journaling. It's been a good day of housekeeping. I'm feeling more prepared for the trail than ever and I'm looking forward to the next couple days. The first state line is coming up soon which will be a huge milestone to check off the list. Soon after crossing the state line into North Carolina, the 100 mile marker isn't far off. To top everything off, the weather is looking great for the next week. All is good in the AT world right now.","Hiawassee

There was another shuttle out of Hiawassee at 11am so I figured that would give me more time to get ready. Dad chose to take the 9am so he could get a jump start ahead of me and enjoy the cooler weather that the morning offers. Typically I would prefer the cooler weather as well but I felt the extra time this morning would be helpful. To start my day I walked over to the convenient store across the street to get a coffee and something for breakfast. They had a cappuccino machine, something I've never had, so I chose that instead of regular coffee. It was really good, but a little on the sweet side for me. Along with the cappuccino I grabbed a massive honey bun. Talk about a sugar rush to start off the morning. Got back to the room and organized my bag one last time. Then it was on to re-lacing my boots. Dad headed out a little after 8:30 and I hopped in the shower. I had some extra time to kill after so I read up on journals on TJ. One that sticks out is Cricket, she was airlifted off the AT by a Blackhawk helicopter after a bout with hypothermia in one of the shelters. She's now back at home and I believe she is doing ok. I can't even imagine what that must've been like. I hope she is able to make it back to the trail to continue her trek.After what seemed like forever, 11am finally arrived and I was sitting in the shuttle with a few other hikers. Most were headed Dicks Creek Gap which is a little ways past where I would be getting off at. After a short ride, everyone who was starting out at Unicoi jumped out. There was a huge table of trail magic at the other end of the parking lot but I decided not to go over since I had just spent two nights in town and hadn't done anything to deserve the magic. And so began the climbing that would seem endless throughout the day. Today was absolutely brutal as far as elevation gain goes. We must've done close to 4500ft over the course of the day. First it was up and out of Unicoi Gap, then back down the other side, then back up Tray Mountain, and down the other side. Following Tray were several little knolls that travelled up and down until we got to our camp site at Swag of the Blue Ridge. Somewhere just before beginning the climb of Tray Mountain there was the biggest setup of trail magic I've seen so far. These guys had three gigantic canvas tents set up where they had been sleeping since Thursday handing out trail magic to any hiker, day or thru, who passed by. They were cooking up some good stuff over an open fire in cast iron pots and pans. Chili, soup, biscuits and sausage, hard boiled eggs, candy, and fresh fruit just to name a few of the things they were dishing out. I simply took an apple and I was on my way after thanking everyone for their generosity. Shortly up the trail I ran into some trail maintainers and talked to them about their work. It was fantastic! And it was very clear to me while hiking before running into the maintainers that someone was currently out doing maintenance or had just recently completed it. They were doing a great job and I was sure to let them know. It's hard work doing trail maintenance, but I know from experience how rewarding it is when finishing up a maintenance trip and knowing that you just did something to give back to the hiking community and make people's trips more enjoyable. After talking with the maintainers, it was a clear shot up to the summit of Tray. Man was that a grind. Definitely the hardest climbs of the AT up until this point. But it was well worth it. The summit offered outstanding views that stretched for miles. The group of people up there already were talking about how you could see Atlanta from the summit. Of course I had no idea what to look for since I have never seen Atlanta before. After standing on the peak for about a half hour, I headed a short way down to the shelter and found my dad soaking up some sun and relaxing for a bit. We hung out there for probably another hour or so, maybe a little less and then we were off. It was a short 3.5 miles from the shelter to where we intended to camp but after climbing so much already it actually turned out to be more difficult than I thought it would be. We eventually made it but it was a slow crawl for most of the 3.5. It was a long day and I'm glad to be laying in my sleeping bag now. I'm exhausted and it should be a great night of sleep.","Hiawassee

Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559399,"Day 12 on the Appalachian Trail April 9Miles Today: 9Total Miles: 70.8I slept in a little later than normal this morning, just around 8am. I knew my legs could use some extra rest after yesterday's climbs. Not in much of a rush, I dilly dallied around and was ready to head out at 9. Actually started the day at 9:15. I walked over to the sites next to mine and wished the two hikers and the ridge runner named Davis a good day. He had quite the load to carry out and I almost offered to help carry some of it. I definitely would've if we had been going to the same place. Its astonishing how much trash people leave out on the trail. Not just little pieces of trash either. Davis was tasked with carrying a 5-6lb tent out with him that someone ditched at a campsite along with a garbage bag close to full with other junk people carelessly left behind. It really grinds my gears that there is so little respect for the world that we live in. Some people... Anyway, it makes me respect people like Davis more who are willing to hike miles in to the mountains to collect garbage that is left behind and make our trails a better place.Shortly after leaving camp, the trail began to climb in elevation again. My legs were already screaming at me for making them trudge uphill even more. The mountain I was climbing, Kelly Knob, turned out to be a real ass kicker and I found myself stopping every couple hundred feet to take 30 seconds breaks before carrying on. About 2/3 of the way up, I knew something wasn't right as I never struggle as much as I was to make my climbs. I reached down to touch my thighs and I couldn't feel my fingers up against either one. My thighs were completely numb. That's when I realized I had my waist strap on my backpack way too tight and I was cutting off the circulation to my legs. No wonder why I was having a hard time. My muscles were getting limited blood flow while forcing them up a steep ass mountain. I loosened my strap and I instantly felt better and slowly regained circulation. Within a few minutes I could feel my legs again. Soon after, I reached the top and was rewarded to a summit by myself and an awesome view. I stayed for 15-20 minutes while waiting for dad to arrive. After he showed up I headed on my way down the mountain. I had run out of water on the way up so I cruised on down to the water source waiting below. I drank a liter at the source and then filled up my bottles. When I returned from filling up, dad was on his way down and we decided to stop and have lunch. I made a salmon wrap with hot sauce and had it gone in seconds. At the time, I wasn't really hungry but I knew my body needed the calories to keep pushing on. I've found that I'm not eating as much as I should and the only time I'm hungry is at dinner. I've heard this is quite common at the start of the AT but after a few weeks you can't get your hands on enough food. After lunch it was a short hike to Dicks Creek Gap. The trail meandered up and down slightly and then it was a steep drop into the Gap. At the Gap I waited around for a half hour or so, listened to some music and laid back on one of the stone picnic tables that was available. That cold stone felt great on my back. When dad arrived we decided on a camp spot for the night which was a short 1.8 miles ahead at Cowart Gap. A slow uphill on the way out of the Gap got my legs running again and then it was down yet again. I stopped at a really nice campsite about 0.3 miles from the Gap we planned on stopping at. It's perfectly situated between two ridges, down in a valley. The site is open enough to fit several tents and has a fire pit but it looks like it will just be dad and I tonight. Nothing wrong with that, it's almost preferred. It's almost 6 now and we're all set up for the night. I've been here since about 3pm just relaxing and hanging out. I heard from Joe a little after I got here. Turns out he took a zero today at Top of Georgia Hostel, about 1.5 miles back from where we are now, to rest up a knee that he twisted coming down Tray Mountain two days ago. He's planning on meeting up with us tomorrow night at our next camp location at Bly Gap. We will be passing our first state border tomorrow and Bly Gap is shortly after. Tomorrow should be a day filled with high spirits as we cross our first major milestone of the trail. Here we come North Carolina!","Swag of the Blue Ridge

Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560023,"Day 13 on the Appalachian TrailApril 10Miles Today: 7.5Total Miles: 78.3I think today was my latest start yet. Once again I stayed in bed until 8. I wasn't too worried about getting going early this morning since it was going to be a short 7.5 miles to Bly Gap. I started taking melatonin at night to help me get a more restful night of sleep but I think that's why I've been getting up later than I was before. Maybe I'm just getting used to sleeping out on the trail every night. I don't think I started walking until 9:30. No big deal. As long as I get where I wanted to be with a couple hours of daylight left in the day I'm content. Joe ended up catching up with us before we even left camp so we got to hike with him for the day. We got the worst climb of the day done and over with right away this morning when we hiked up and out of Cowart Gap. About 3.5 miles in we decided to stop and have an early lunch at Plumorchard Shelter. We sat there, ate food and conversed with other hikers who strolled in for about and hour and then headed on our way. For most of the rest of the day the trail travelled continuously uphill at a minor grade. Shortly after lunch we travelled through an area where a wildfire had been. The trees were all charred about a foot from the base down. After a couple hours of hiking I made it to the state line of Georgia and North Carolina. It was a great feeling being able to check off one state from the list. 13 left to go! I waited at the border line for a bit to see Joe and my dad cross over as well. Once they had both arrived I walked up to where our camp would be for the night which was a short 0.1 from the border and filled up my water. Joe had already begun setting up his tent and when I found him I set mine next to his. Dad hung his hammock right in front of both our tents. The afternoon was spent hanging out, relaxing and determining how far we had to go over the next few days in order to make it to Franklin, NC at mile 109 by Thursday. We're planning on 12 miles tomorrow and then splitting the rest between the other two days. Camp is full tonight. Definitely the most amount of people I've stayed with since starting the AT. There's got to be at least 30 people here for the night. It's the first night I've felt the need to take out my ear plugs. My dad, Joe and I are all planning an early start tomorrow to get some of the miles done before it gets hot. Aiming for a 6:15 wake up tomorrow. Sorry for the short post tonight. Feeling pretty tired and looking forward to putting my head down for the night.","Cowart Gap

Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560024,"Day 14 on the Appalachian Trail April 11Miles Today: 12.1Total Miles: 90.4Up nice and early this morning just like I wanted to be. Well, actually about 15 minutes later than I wanted to be up. I forgot to set my watch alarm for 6:15 when I went to bed because I was so tired but thankfully I woke up on my own just before 6:30. I instantly hopped out of bed and began breaking down my gear. By this time Dad was almost done taking his hammock down and shortly after Joe got up as well. Dad rolled out at 7. I could've been ready to leave shortly after but I hung around and worked up some motivation for the day. I left at 8 while Joe was taking down his tent. The first climb out of Bly Gap was absolutely brutal. It was short but it was a real ass kicker. North Carolina doesn't mess around. After the initial climb out of the gap it was another climb up and over a knob and down into another Sassafras Gap. From there on out the trail was smooth sailing and mostly flat or downhill for several miles. It definitely made the intended 12 miles for the day a heck of a lot easier and faster. I was clipping right along at 2.5-3 miles an hour. Pretty soon I was dropping down into Deep Gap which was just before Standing Indian Mountain. I began the climb up Standing Indian, the highest point on the AT so far, and stopped a short ways in when I got to the shelter. Joe, my dad, and I decided that would be our spot for lunch today. I got there a few minutes past 11. Felt pretty good to get 7.7 miles out of the way in just a little over 3 hours time. 15 minutes later, Dad rolled in, also feeling good about his progress for the day. We stopped, had lunch and waited for about an hour. No sign of Joe. I carried on up the rest of Standing Indian Mountain. The rest of the climb ended up being surprisingly easy and I was rewarded with a terrific view at the top. It was definitely the best summit yet. It was clear, had a great view, and an awesome patch of nice green grass that I eventually laid down on for about a half hour. Off in the distance I could see smoke rising up out of the forest. A bit earlier at the shelter a guy had mentioned that there was a forest fire a ways up the trail and mile 109-115 were closed off. That's exactly where we are heading in the next 2 days so hopefully things are well by then. Worried about finding a decent camp site for the night due to the bubble we are in right now, I carried on down the mountain before everyone else to claim my spot. I cruised down the mountain and eventually ran in to my Dad. He had passed up on the opportunity to take the side trail to the summit of Standing Indian. We were the first to arrive in Beech Gap for the night. Not long after, people began to pour in. I'm glad we were the first ones here and were able to pick out good spots. Still haven't seen Joe, and I don't have service here to contact him, but hopefully he will roll in to camp soon. It's only 4:30 right now so he's got plenty of time to get here.","Bly Gap

I'm having more fun than I ever would've imagined while hiking and I can't wait to see what the future holds. Everything about today was kick-ass. I woke up at 6:30 to my alarm. Joe was already up, out of bed and packing up. Apparently Dad had left about 15-20 minutes before I got up. Ended up taking a bit longer than I wanted to to get out on the trail. Was aiming for 7:30 but was closer to 8. The day started off real nice by going downhill. It was awesome to get the legs moving and warmed up before having to do any serious climbs. The miles seemed to be flying by. A few minutes past 9 and I had already gone 3.2 miles to Carter Gap Shelter. I was feeling good and I knew the rest of the day was going to great. Before I knew it I was jammin' while walking down the trail. There were several instances of dancing, singing, head banging, and air guitar. I need to film myself while doing this sometime on the trail because it must be a good sight. I feel bad for the first day hiker to run into me while I'm doing this. Theme song for the day: Nothin' But A Good Time by Poison. Not far into the trail we began walking through what is now my favorite part of the trail so far. On each side of the trail were charred rhododendrons where a forest fire had gone through the trail that made a super cool tunnel effect. It's terrible that that section of land was effected by a fire but it was certainly a cool spot to see. Around noon I was getting close to the most difficult climb of the day, Albert Mountain, a short 0.2 mile section but the trail was vertical. I came across a man by the name of Rodney doing some trail magic out of the back of his white pickup truck. He had a wonderful spread with coffee, strawberries, pineapple, bananas, clementines, muffins, and orange juice. I had a banana followed by a mini fruit salad in a cup with strawberries and pineapple. A cup of OJ hit the spot and a cup of coffee followed. I stayed and chatted with Rodney for a half hour, thanked him immensely for his generosity, and headed on my way. That magic fueled me back up and I was quickly at the base of Albert Mountain. After a short climb to the top, I ran into my dad as well as several other hikers at the fire tower. We all stayed up there for quite awhile. I steady flow of hikers continued to make the summit as others would leave. Everyone was loving the view and climbing to the top of the fire tower to get more. A full 360 degree view was awarded to whoever made the climb. With gray clouds rolling in from the distance I got on my way and made the short few miles down to the shelter Joe and I are staying at tonight. On the way down I stopped to snap a picture of the 100 mile marker. Dad continued on a bit farther to get an advantage on tomorrow. I arrived around 2pm and was once again impressed by the miles put in and how early I had finished. I easily could've continued on for another several miles. I had a late lunch at 3 and an hour later Joe showed up. We now both have our tents set up down past the shelter a ways. About to cook dinner here in a few minutes now that it's 6. We're planning on an early night so we can get up at 5am and be out of camp at 6. We have a short 7.2 miles to get to Winding Stair Gap where we will be heading in to Franklin, NC for a night and then a zero day. Really looking forward to a shower, some real food and a couple beers.","Beech Gap

Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560379,"Day 19 on the Appalachian Trail April 16Miles Today: 11.5Total Miles: 131.1Was aiming for 6:15am this morning but wound up actually crawling out of bed just after 6:30am. Since we stayed on top of Wayah Bald we were hoping to wake up early to catch the sunrise. Unfortunately when we woke up and the fog had set in. Despite not having a view, the valley still looked pretty cool with all the fog rolling through it. Shortly after we woke up, a group of what I assume are locals showed up to potentially see the sunrise as well. They hung around for a while and then headed off. Not in too much of a rush to get on the trail I hung around a bit, looked out at the foggy valley, and took my time getting my stuff together. After everything was packed I spread my Easter eggs filled with candy around the stone structure and the bald. Hopefully they are all found and people enjoyed the goodies inside. I also gave mom a call to say Happy Easter and to catch up for a few minutes. She was on her way to brunch with some other family members. Kinda odd not being with all my family today. I hope they all had a good Easter. Ended up on the trail at 9:20 and started off with a real nice downhill section to get the legs up and running. Since we stayed on a Bald last night we had to dip down into the next Gap which ended up being called Licklog Gap. Not sure who comes up with some of these names but there are definitely some odd ones. After Licklog i was faced with my first real climb of the day and then down into Burningtown Gap. At Burningtown I ran into a few sets of people doing trail magic. With a great selection to chose from, I went with two oranges and then a very kind lady offered to make me a ham sandwich. Having not eaten lunch yet I graciously accepted her kind offer and was soon munching on a delicious ham and cheese. This wasn't ordinary ham from the deli either, this was a freshly cooked ham that she had done up herself. By far one of the best pieces of trail magic to date and it definitely made my next climb up Rocky Bald much easier. Once I reached the top of Rocky Bald there was a side trail to the actual summit. On the sign for the side trail was several graffiti notes saying not to pass up the view and that it was definitely worth the extra climb. Us AT'ers will hike all damn day when the miles count towards our goal of 2000+ but we will hesitate to do any extra walking, especially when it's uphill, for a view, a water source, or even to a place while we're in town. We're the laziest, active people to ever exist. I can say myself that those graffiti notes on the trail sign held true. The view from the top was spectacular and I decided it would be a perfect spot to eat some snacks and take in the view. I also saw my first snake on the trail at the top. It wasn't anything dangerous, but it was a decent sized garter. I didn't even notice it until I got too close and it moved away. I'm lucky it was nothing dangerous as it easily could've reached me with a bite had it been. Lesson of the day: be more cautious and vigilant. Not long after my encounter with the snake Jay and Sarah, a young couple my age (22 & 21) arrived. We've been hiking with the same group of people over the last few days and I've run into them several times all of which have been pleasant. We sat at the top for a while and then the two headed off. I wasn't far behind. After Rocky Bald it was a steep descent into Tellico Gap. I believe it was the steepest downhill section of the trail so far and my knees could definitely feel it. They don't hurt but they ache from all the stress they are being put under everyday. Downhills are when I feel it the most. After the short climb down into the Gap it was time for the final ascent of the day up to Wesser Bald. The climb wasn't too bad. It lasted quite awhile and tricked me with a false summit but before long I made it to the top and climbed up the fire tower at the top. There was no shortage of great views today. This fire tower had a wonderful one as well. Jay and Sarah were already up top taking it in when I arrived. Shortly after being at the top I saw my dad arrive below. I had passed him on the way up. I went down to talk to him and we decided we would walk another 0.8 to the shelter and stay there. I was on my way and he sat for a few minutes. I quickly made it down to the shelter and set up my tent nearby on the flattest spot available. Dad rolled in a few minutes later and decided to push on another 0.5 to the top of a knob to set up his hammock. After I got my stuff set up Jay and Sarah arrived, and then Joe a bit after them. Jay and Sarah called me over to have dinner with them. We cooked and ate together, then hung out and chatted for a while. I hope we continue to hike at the same rate. Jay and I have similar interests in hunting and fishing so we've been getting along great. After dinner we all hung our bear bags and I headed off to my tent to do some journaling. As some of you probably have noticed I have fallen behind. I will be posting several from the last couple days tomorrow. The journaling didn't last long. Another girl came over to talk to me about my tent and some other stuff. I can't remember her name at the moment but I'm sure I'll find it out again at some point. As she was leaving, Joe came over and made his nightly tea. We chatted a bit and had a few good laughs. He may be staying at the NOC tomorrow night to wait for Murph so I might not be hiking with him for a few days. Then it was off to bed. It's now 9:30 and way past my bed time as I'm finishing this up. Tomorrow will be a several mile descent in to the NOC where I will be picking up a food drop and then making a dent in the several mile ascent out of the NOC which no one I've talked to is looking forward to. Oh, Happy Easter everyone","Wayah Bald

Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560537,"Day 20 on the Appalachian TrailApril 17Miles Today: 6 Total Miles: 137.1We didn't go in to today expecting it to be a nearo day. Originally I had wanted to get down to the NOC, grab my resupply, and get a decent start on the climb out which is over 3,000ft in less than 7 miles. Once we got down to the Nantahala Outdoor Center it was a whole other story.I got up at 6:45 this morning wanting to get an early start on the day. Normal breakdown occurred and I was on the trail at 8. Joe was in the process of taking his stuff down when I left and I knew he wouldn't be far behind. Dad camped a bit further down the trail so I expected to see him shortly after leaving. After about a mile in I hadn't seen him yet so I turned my cell service on and got a text from him saying he headed out. Not long after I ran in to him while he was taking in a view. From there on out it was real nice hiking for the day. Today wasn't the typical 2.5-3mph/hr hiking either. Today was technical. Today was full of the hiking I love most. Every step required precision and one wrong step would send you tumbling hundreds of feet down on either side of the trail. We were walking on a ridge and it was spectacular. It reminded me of hiking in the Whites and gave me a taste for what's to come. Most of the trail up to this point has been senseless one foot in front of the other with no care to where you plant your feet. Not that there's anything wrong with that but it gets old after a while and it's fun to traverse some more challenging terrain. After a few miles of descent the trail got a bit easier and I was quickly making my way down in to the NOC. By 11 I was at the base with dad and we decided to sit for a bit down by the river. There were several ducks swimming around and diving for food. I went in to get my supply box and when I came out the river had risen quite a bit due to the releasing of the dam. Not long after sitting around we started to look for a place to camp. We came across some train tracks and decided to walk down them where we saw another hiker come from. About half a mile down the tracks we came across the most amazing camp site right along the edge of the Nantahala River. It was absolutely perfect and I knew I wanted to spend the night here. After getting camp set up we heard from Joe and told him how to get to our campsite. Once he arrived, he loved it just as much as we did and he was perfectly content with spending the night. Before long we were headed to the store to get a 6-pack each. My dad and I chose a 12'er of Terrapin IPA's. Being a fan of the Grateful Dead made it a no brainer. Not long after we were sitting down at the river enjoying some cold brews. It was an afternoon for the books. It doesn't get much better than hiking all morning, getting camp set up and then drinking some cold ones by a river. Absolutely perfect day. Around 5pm a bit of rain began to roll in so we decided to head to the local restaurant and get some food. I had a personal pizza that was fantastic while dad and Joe each had a 1/2lb burger each. Not wanting to go back to our tents in the rain, we headed to what we thought was a bar at the nearby pavilion which actually ended up being closed. Instead of a bar, it was full of thru-hikers and we had a mini hiker bash. Everyone was having some beers, talking and having a great time. By 8:30 the rain had stopped and most people had headed out to their cabins to go to bed. Joe, dad and I headed back to our campsite and I got a decently sized fire going. We sat around that for quite awhile and dried some wet clothes. Now it's nearly 11 and I'm up later than I've been since leaving for the AT. With a big day of climbing ahead of me I'm a little bit worried I won't be getting enough sleep tonight. It's been worth it and I wouldn't change a thing about today if I had to do it over again. It's been one hell of a day. Tomorrow we climb out of the NOC and continue North.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560647,"Day 21 on the Appalachian Trail April 18Miles Today: 10.2Total Miles: 147.4I ended up sleeping really well last night and woke up feeling rested even though I was up way later than I should've been. It's a good thing too because today required every bit of energy I had. I'm completely exhausted and it's only 7 right now. I'll be heading to bed shortly after finishing this post and I'll probably sleep in a bit tomorrow since it's going to be a short day.My alarm sounded at 6:45, I woke up and laid in bed for another 15 minutes. I started to pack up from inside of my tent since it was raining and I figured I could get a decent amount of it done by sitting inside. By the time I finished what I could complete from in my tent, the rain had let up a bit so I rushed to get my tent down. Almost 100% successful in keeping my tent dry. A few drops of rain snuck in while I took off rainfly. Nothing I wouldn't be able to dry out later with my towel. I left camp at 8:30 and headed up to the NOC to dump some trash and leave behind some food I didn't want from my supply box, mostly ramens. By the time that was finished it was just before 9 and I was headed up the nearly 4,000 foot climb to the top of Cheoah Bald. It drizzled for a bit at the beginning of the day but I had on my poncho to keep my pack and myself dry. A lot of good that did... after 30 minutes of continuous up I felt like I was in a sauna and I had to take it off. By this point the rain had stopped but go figure, not 5 minutes after I took it off the rain started back up again. Instead of stopping to put it back on I carried on and enjoyed the cool drops of water falling from the sky as I trudged my way up the mountain. I expected to run in to my dad not far in to the trail but he had left at 7am without me knowing. As I continued to climb I realized the day wasn't going to be as difficult as I had originally thought it would be. Of course it was still going to be hard but no where near as bad as I expected. The miles and elevation gain were actually coming quickly and I arrived at the Sassafras Gap Shelter in about 3 hours. My dad was there when I arrived. He said he had only been there about 10-15 minutes before I showed up. We both sat around the shelter for a bit but as more people showed up the shelter got crowded and loud. Didn't take long for us to want to get out of there, and that's what we did. We both headed out of the shelter at the same time. Dad let me pass ahead and I made short work of the 1 mile climb to the top of the bald. Unfortunately for us, we were socked-in by fog for most of the day and we had no views throughout it. From the summit it was a short 2.5 miles down to Locust Cove which is where we intended to spend the night. That short 2.5 miles felt like a hell of a lot more than that due to a nasty blister that had been bothering me for most of the morning. By this point it had gotten large and was extremely sensitive. Every step was painful and I had a noticeable limp for the rest of the day. Once I managed to struggle my way to the Cove I set up my tent right away to ensure it would stay dry and be able to air out. The rain had stopped but there was no telling when it would come back. We're expecting rain everyday for the next 7 days. Joy! About a half hour after I had gotten to the Cove, Dad arrived. He got to setting up his hammock and was done shortly after. We then chatted about grabbing a room at the Fontana Village for Thursday night and then heading on for the Smokies on Friday morning. I called and 5 minutes later we had a room to sleep in, dry our gear and rest up in before the Smokies. No word from Joe today but I let him know our plans and he's welcome to join. Once that was settled I went through my food bag and organized everything from my supply box, had some snacks, and made dinner a bit afterwards. Jay and Sarah showed up while I was cooking dinner and they have set up their tent next to mine. Sounds like they will be heading to Fontana tomorrow while we won't be there till Thursday so we may not see them for a bit after tonight. I hope they continue to do well on the trail. I forgot to mention in yesterday's post that we got to talk to Murph. He's been off trail for a couple days now due to an injury and is aiming to be back this coming Saturday. He'll be starting up at the NOC and we're hoping he can catch up to us so we can all hike together.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560850,"Day 22 on the Appalachian TrailApril 19Miles Today: 8.4Total Miles: 155.7It rained hard for almost the entire night last night. I woke up this morning to the inside of my tent being a bit wet and the entire outside of it being covered in mud from the rain hitting the ground so hard around me. Feeling discouraged by the rain when I woke up at 6:45 I decided to go back to bed and possibly wait it out. I woke up an hour later and could still hear the rain hitting my rainfly so I just lazed around in bed and looked at the map for the day. Nothing seemed like it would be too difficult. After waiting an hour or so in my tent for the rain to stop I eventually gave up and got out. Turns out it wasn't even raining, it was just the water falling from the trees above and the rhododendron bushes around me... I probably could've gotten going a lot sooner than I did. Oh well, it turned out for the best anyway because my late start led to my dad and I getting a ride into the town of Robbinsville. Once I got out of bed, I quickly broke everything down and got it stored in my bag. Jay and Sarah offered me some of the breakfast they were cooking up. It was blueberry oatmeal with banana chips, honey and coconut. Typically I'm not a fan of oatmeal but this was damn good and it was nice having a hot breakfast for a change. It seems like Jay and Sarah whip up some pretty good meals in the very large pot they carry with them. I thanked them and headed off. About 2 miles down the trail I got a text from Dad saying there was a guy at Stecoah Gap offering rides to town. I told him I had a mile to go and would be there shortly. At the time I really didn't have a need to go to town but once I got there I changed my mind when the man offering the ride said there was a pizza buffet for $8. Sold. Plus we could throw our wet stuff in a dryer at the local laundromat. We hopped in his truck and were soon in town. He drove us around and showed us where the laundromat was and then took us to the pizza shop. We thanked him and headed in. I grabbed 4 full plates of food, one at a time, and brought them back to our table before sitting down to eat. I had a huge salad, a bunch of pizza, spaghetti, breadsticks, and several slices of dessert pizza. I quickly devoured the food in front of me and then realized I was going to have one hell of a time hiking the remaining 5 miles for the day. Once we finished our meals we had a 1 mile walk across town to the laundromat. The sun had come out and it allowed us to dry out our packs a bit while walking. When we got to the laundromat we put all our down gear in one dryer and other wet items such as clothing and dry sacks in another. While everything was being dried I took the remaining gear I had that couldn't go in the dryer and set it up on the lawn outside in the sun. After 20 minutes, everything I had was completely dry. It was a good feeling knowing that I would have dry gear to stay in tonight. We packed up and headed out of the laundromat. We set up outside of Ingles and began to hitch. About 10 minutes passed and a man in a truck pulled up and told us to hop in the back. He didn't even ask where we were going, he already knew and brought us back right where we needed to be. The ride in the back of the truck was awesome. It felt nice to be flying down a highway at 55mph and having the wind blow through my hair. We began hiking right away once we got back to Stecoah Gap. We began climbing right out of the gap and my full stomach was not making it an easy trek. It was pretty slow going to start but eventually I picked up the pace. After a steep climb I ran into an older man named Octo. He just turned 84 on the 12th and I talked with him while we both continued to hike to the shelter nearby. He's been doing small section hikes for years now and is slowly working his way north. I've gotta say, for his age he was doing a damn good job. When I first ran in to him he had just done the steep climb that I had done and it didn't look like he even broke a sweat. Once we got to the shelter we continued to chat with some other people there. I offered to walk down to the water source and fill his water while I did mine. He took me up on the offer without hesitation. When I returned he thanked me and tried to give me some food in return. I told him it wasn't necessary and that I was glad to help and save him a trip down the steep path to the water source. After a bit more conversation I headed on my way and said farewell to Octo. I hope he is able to continue on his journey north. It was a pleasure to meet him and with any luck I'll run in to him in Fontana tomorrow. From the shelter it was 2.9 miles to Cody Gap where we planned on staying. I quickly finished up the miles and was at camp by 5. With gray clouds rolling in I was hoping to make it there before the rain started. I was successful and quickly had everything set up in case the skies decided to open up. Not long after I got to the Gap, Dad showed up. About an hour and a half after him, Joe came rolling in. Then Jay and Sarah. We all made and ate dinner together, did some caching up, and listened to some music I was playing off my phone. Right around 9 everyone headed off to bed. Tomorrow is looking like a pretty easy day. Another day with short mileage and a booked room at the lodge to look forward to. I'll be falling asleep to the calls of several different owls that are nearby tonight. They are making quite the ruckus right now and it's really cool to listen to.","Locust Cove

Currently sitting in the a room at the Fontana Lodge. It's getting late and we have a big day ahead of us tomorrow so I'll be trying to get to bed as soon as possible. We all got up at a decent hour this morning and got headed on the trail to get in to Fontana. I was on the trial right at 8:30 and quickly hiked the first 2 miles to our first water source where I needed to fill up. Jay, Sarah, and Joe all caught up to me while I was filling up. We all departed the water source together and trudged on. We quickly came to our first, and only big climb of the day. We all pressed on and we're at the top of the climb within a half hour of starting it. We all stopped at the top to eat a bit. When we got to the top, dad was already there having a bite to eat. After snacking we all headed on and worked our way towards Fontana. A couple miles after we arrived at the road where the shuttle to the lodge picks hikers up. After waiting about 45 minutes the shuttle came by and picked us up along with several other thru-hikers. After arriving at the lodge, which is extremely nice by the way, we were able to check in to our room early and begin getting things ready for the trail ahead. We all showered, picked up our supply boxes, and went through our bags. Dad and I then went and got lunch at the restaurant nearby. When we returned we gathered our laundry and I walked it down, washed it and dried it, then brought it back to the room for everyone to go through and pick out their stuff. We all ate dinner from the extras in our supply boxes and figured out our plan for the beginning of the Smokies. Tomorrow looks like a short day with a lot of climbing to a legal tent site. From there we will be required to stay in shelters for the remainder of the national park. We are planning on heading in to Gatlinburg, TN on our 4th day to resupply and take a zero. Hopefully all goes as planned.","Cody Gap

My allergies definitely set in last night while we were at a low elevation where the pollen count was high. Everyone was up by 7 and packing their stuff up. First shuttle back out from the lodge was at 8:30 so we wanted to make sure we were on that one so we could get a decent start time on the trail. Dad and I were waiting outside for it just after 8. Joe decided to hang back and have breakfast and would catch the next one after 8:30. The shuttle dropped us off along with a crew of others where we had stopped yesterday. We had an easy 2.5 mile hike from there across the Fontana Dam. Dad and I made it to the dam in less than an hour and we slowly made our way across it. The dam was absolutely amazing. It's the 2nd largest dam in the states and only took 3 years to make. I stopped to take several pictures. After snapping some photos I continued across and met Dad on the other side. It was then a short walk up a road to the trailhead into the Great Smoky National Forest. We each dropped our permits in the dropbox and headed into the forest. I struggled quite a bit on the initial climb out of the dam. It was more of a mental struggle than physical. I couldn't stop thinking of home and Zealand. The miles came slow while but I continued my way up. After a few hours I made my way to the top of the Shuckstack fire tower and had 360 degree views of the area nearby. You could clearly see the Fontana Dam and what had once seemed massive now looked extremely small compared to the the forests surrounding it. I sat below the fire tower and had a tuna wrap for lunch. On my way down, I ran into Dad who was on his way up to also have lunch. I continued on for a little more than a mile to the campsite we planned on staying at. Birch Spring campsite is the only place in the Smokies where you are not required to stay inside of or directly nearby a shelter. Now we are up in elevation and the rest of the Smokies should be easier with smaller ups and downs. When I arrived at the campsite I was surprised to not see anyone else here. I was a bit early, I arrived at 2pm, and I expect more people to roll in as the day continues. Not long after I got here, Dad rolled in, and then an hour or so later Joe arrived. Everyone is set up now and I'm sure before long we will gather together to make dinner and chat about the day. I'm glad to be done for the day. The extra rest will be helpful and I'm looking forward to performing better tomorrow. Right now we plan on getting to Garlinburg, TN on Monday afternoon and to stay in a hotel that night as well as Tuesday night after a needed zero day.","Fontana Village

We all wanted to get up early for a cool morning start. I got up at 6:45 and was able to break everything down and be on the trail right at 7:30. Slowly, I'm getting quicker at getting my stuff ready to go in the morning. The trail started off with a slight climb but nothing too bad. As I hiked I watched the sun try to fight its way through the misty morning air. It was fighting a losing battle and was never able to fully break through. Before long I was at the top of Doe Knob and was headed down. The trail became muddy and slippery from the heavy rain we got last night. I had a few slips from the mud but nothing that led me to the ground. The trail then began to climb up to Mollies Ridge Shelter. It was a gradual climb that didn't require much work. It didn't take long for Dad and I to get to the shelter where we stopped to have some food. I took out my rain fly and hung it so it could dry a bit. After 45 minutes we headed back out and worked our way down to the next shelter, Russell Field. Once again we stopped for a bit, chatted with some day hikers and headed back out. After another hour we made it to our stop for the night at Spence Field Shelter. We are expecting some heavy rain tonight as well as tomorrow so we decided it might be better to stay in the shelter tonight to stay dry. Should make for an easy morning as well without having to pack up the tent. Once we got to Spence we each had lunch and filled up some water. After about an hour, Joe showed up and had decided he was going to push on for another 6.2 miles to the next shelter and make for a 17 mile day. We won't see him again until we get to Gatlinburg. Dad and I are just hanging out now doing some journaling. Hopefully we don't have a crew of day hikers come in to the shelter and force us out. Day hikers have first rights to the shelters in the Smokies so if there is no room for them when they show up thru hikers get kicked out until there is enough room to fit the day hikers. Pretty BS if you ask me but it is what it is and we'll hope it doesn't happen to us. I'll be some kind of PO'ed if a bunch of them show up once the rain begins and I have to set up my tent while it's pouring. After tonight it's looking like a 13.5 mile day tomorrow and then a 10.5 mile day over Clingman's Dome and down in to Newfound Gap where we can get in to Gatlinburg.","Birch Spring Campsite

It started down pouring last night which continued well in to this morning and for most of the day. Feeling the need to push further on down the trail, Dad and I both had decided to move on. 
I got up at 7am after a restless night in the shelter. People next to me and above me snored all night and kept me awake for a good portion of it. Aside from the noise, my back did not agree with sleeping on a hard wood surface even with my sleeping pad underneath. I fought my way out of my sleeping bag and got my stuff together. At least it was easier not having to break a tent down. I managed to leave the shelter at 7:45 after chatting with several other hikers and finally working up the courage to step out into the cold, wet rain. Within a half hour and a mile into the day I was soaked from head to foot. At the time my spirits were still high and I was jamming to some music as I headed down the trail. As my boots became more and more wet my spirits began to fade and I was soon walking in puddles of water. 
Eventually I caught up to Dad who had left about 45 minutes earlier and we decided it would be best to just stop at the upcoming shelter that was still about 3 miles away at the time. Knowing very well that the spaces inside the shelter would be full my spirits began to fade even further. The last couple miles were a grind but we managed to make it to the shelter a bit after 10. Completely soaked we headed in to the shelter to escape the rain. As expected, no one who had spent the night there last night had moved and the shelter was filled to the brim. I stood inside for a while and quickly became extremely cold. I was drenched, had stopped hiking which was the only thing keeping me warm, and had no way of getting in to a dry shelter and being able to change. I continued to stand in the shelter unsure of how to go about what I knew needed to be done. I was borderline hypothermic by the time I got around to setting up my tent. I got it set up as quickly as possible as to keep the rain from getting inside, threw my sleeping bag in, stripped off all my clothes and climbed inside. I huddled up inside and quickly fell asleep. I woke up a few hours later completely dry and warm as could be. I spent the rest of the day and night laying in my tent. Needless to say it was a long day and I spent the remainder of it fighting off the thoughts that were racing through my head, several of which were about getting off the trail and going home. Eventually 7:30 rolled around and I took a melatonin and I fell asleep quickly after. Finally I was at ease from my own thoughts. Things can get pretty rough when you're trapped inside your own tent for hours with no one to talk to and laugh with.","Spence Field Shelter

It was an early morning this morning, mostly due to a group of rude thru's who made as much noise as they wanted at 4:30am when they got up to start the day. I woke up several times to their loud voices, and bright headlamps shining in to my tent. On any other day I would've been thoroughly annoyed but I wanted to be up early any way so I could get started towards Clingmans Dome and then in to  Gatlinburg so I could get out of my wet clothes and dry things out.
I ended up actually getting started with my day at 5:30. It was wet and cold outside of my tent which slowed my morning ritual. Eventually I said screw it and got going knowing that the sooner I got started, the sooner I could get to town. I got out of my warm, dry tent and faced the morning's brisk air. After I took everything down I was faced with what would be the hardest task of the day, putting on my soaking wet boots. With some hesitation I slid my feet in to each one and within minutes my socks and feet were drenched. I walked over to the shelter and chatted with Joe (who I will now be referring to as Bon Appetite) and my dad (from now on Kinsman) who had both gotten out of bed and began getting ready for the day. Kinsman headed out shortly after and I ended up waiting around until 8 talking with Bon Appetite before I left. 
The trail was a muddy mess right from the get go. Every step required more effort than usual and ground was lost with every slip of a boot. It made for tough hiking but with thoughts of town in my head I pressed on to the next shelter within 2 hours. Kinsman was there waiting when I arrived. I sat down to eat and then some other hikers rolled in. Their names were Parakeet, Obi-Wan-Potato, and Pepperoni. Great group of hikers and Parakeet would end up sharing a room with Bon Appetite, Kinsman, and myself in Gatlinburg. We noticed the fireplace in the shelter was smoking a bit so I took the opportunity to blow on it a bit and within a few seconds I had a nice, toasty fire going to warm us up and dry us out. We sat around for nearly an hour in front of the fire and then Bon Appetite strolled in all hopped up on 4-C energy drinks. Everyone's spirits had risen drastically from yesterday and this morning. After a bit more conversation about the day, I headed off for Clingmans. It was only another 4 miles away and I was excited to get to the top and then get in to town. 
After a bit of climbing, I reached Clingmans right around 2pm. It didn't take long for the others to arrive after me. We all spent some time at the observation tower although we couldn't see any of the views due to the fog surrounding us. With nothing to be seen we didn't spend much time at the top and we headed down to the parking lot to try and hitch a ride in to Gatlinburg. Bon Appetite started chatting up a guy on the way down and we had a ride before we knew it. Parakeet, Bon Appetite, Kinsman, and myself climbed in the gentleman's van and headed down to town. After a 40 minute ride or so, he dropped us off at our hotel. We thanked him greatly and headed our own ways. We quickly got in to our room and began the usual gear-splosion. There was hiking gear everywhere.. we soon after headed out to the general store right next to the hotel and we all got some hot sandwiches cooked up for us which we devoured within minutes. After purchasing some beer we went back to the room and relaxed for the rest of the day. Tomorrow will be a zero day filled with chores such as laundry, grocery shopping, drying gear, and planning the next several days of hiking.","Derrick Knob Shelter

Everyone was up by 7 this morning and ready to get started on the days chores. Of course, the faster chores get done, the sooner we can get to lazing around and relaxing. We all headed to the general store again to get coffee and first breakfast. We sat there a while, ate and then headed back to the room. After about an hour, Bon Appetite, Parakeet, and I headed to a restaurant called Breakfast Camp for second breakfasts. This place was awesome! It was rustic and old timey with a old western theme. The menus were made out of newspaper and listed endless amounts of dishes that all sounded delicious. I decided to go with a 3 egg omelette with bacon, sausage, ham, cheese, peppers, onions, jalapeños and hot sauce with a side of toast and ""camp fries."" Talk about amazing and I don't even like eggs. Maybe that'll change by the end of the trip. After everyone ate we headed back to the room and got laundry together. We had to get across town to the laundromat and grocery store so we took the trolley which served as a mini tour of Gatlinburg as well. This place was a tourist trap. A town setup solely on the ability to profit off of the Smokey Mountains. There had to be at least 20 hotels along with an aquarium, arcade, museum, and tons of different restaurants. Eventually we made it to the laundromat and threw all our clothes in. While the laundry was washing we went to the dollar store next to us and we're able to do most of our resupplying there. By the time that was over we were able to put our laundry in the dryer. We sat around outside while everything was drying and we're able to play with a puppy which kept us entertained until our clothes were done.
After the laundromat we walked a half mile down to the real grocery store and we're able to finish up resupplying. 30 minutes later and we were set to be back on the trail. We hopped back on the trolley, headed back to the room, and began prepping our food. The rest of the afternoon was spent laying out gear to dry, making some repairs and checking out the outfitter across the street. Bon Appetite had to pick up some replacement trekking poles as well as get a new sleeping pad so we all went to look around. We hung around the room until 8 and then went to get dinner at a nearby restaurant called Calhouns. For a chain restaurant it was absolutely incredible and the food I got was to die for. My plate consisted of BBQ pulled pork, ribs, chicken fingers, french fries, and mac n cheese. Bon Appetite, Parakeet, and Kinsman's dinners looked just as good as mine. We all enjoyed our food, had some great conversations and came to the conclusion that today had been the best town day yet. At the end of dinner, Bon Appetite snuck his card to the waitress and took care of the bill. When we realized what had happened we all thanked him greatly. A little bit of trail magic from one of our own. I couldn't be happier with the group of people that I have ended up hiking with and meeting. People told me ahead of time that I would make some of the best friends that I'd have for the rest of my life while on the trail and it's absolutely true.","Gatlinburg

This morning was my hardest morning getting out of bed. We ended up staying up until nearly 12 last night and we're supposed to get up at 6 so we could get going and make the 8:30 shuttle from the NOC to Clingmans Dome. My first alarm went off and I instantly snoozed it. Next alarm went off 15 minutes later and I managed to wake up but sat in bed for the next 20 minutes or so trying to fight the urge to close my eyes again. Eventually I decided the best way to wake up would be to walk to the convenient store to get coffee so out the door I went. A short walk later and I arrived at the store.. closed until 8am. No biggie, the general store opened at 7 so I went back to the room, waited 10 minutes and then Parakeet, Bon Appetite and I walked down. Instead of coffee I went with a red bull which quickly got me on my feet and motivated for the day. My bag was packed and ready to go soon after getting back to the room. Everyone headed out to the shuttle pick up location at 8. We took some pictures together and hung out a bit. We watched as a pick up truck rolled in to the parking lot. He put down his window and said he would take as many people as he could fit in the bed of the truck up the mountain. Without hesitation we grabbed our gear, threw it in and hopped in the back. We all squeezed together in order to create some heat. It would be a cold ride to the top for sure. On our way up the mountain we had wonderful views of the surrounding mountains, water sources and valleys. It was a complete bluebird day and we couldn't have asked for a better one. A half hour later we arrived at the parking lot for Clingmans Dome. There were a few other hikers there when we arrived, one of which had a guitar. Parakeet walked over and soon began strumming away. She played a beautiful song that made the views that much better. Afterwards we began the half mile climb to he observation tower where the trail started back up again. We all went to the top of the tower to check out the views we couldn't see on Monday due to the fog. I'm glad we were able to come back because the 360 degree view from the top was absolutely amazing. 
After taking in the views for a while we started down the trail and I was quickly sailing along. The trail was almost identical to the White Mountains and I was easily picking out the perfect line of travel and almost running down the trail hopping between rocks, logs and roots. It didn't take long for me to get 5 miles in to the day to Indian Grave Gap where Kinsman and I decided to have lunch. We laid in a very nice grassy area next to a parking lot for nearly 2 hours, ate lunch, enjoyed the hot sun, and I did some catching up on journaling. It was a perfect way to take a break in the middle of the day. Bon Appetite and Parakeet walked in towards the end of our break and decided they would hang out a bit as well. Since the next Gap, Newfound Gap, was less than 2 miles away we all headed out and made our way there. On our arrival we were greeted by some trail angels doing some magic. We were offered hotdogs along with some other trail snacks. I was give two hotdogs which I smothered in mustard and had down in a few large bites. They were fantastic and hit the spot after hiking a couple more miles. We all sat around and chatted with the angels for a while before heading off for the shelter. 
After departing from the trail magic at Newfound Gap, I began the climb to Icewater Spring Shelter which was a short 3 miles away. Right at the start of the trail coming out of the gap was a sign listing the mileage to certain areas along the trail. At the bottom of the sign it said ""Mt. Katahdin - 1,972."" On my way by I put out my hand and pressed it to the sign on the 1,972. At that moment I felt more like a thru-hiker than I ever had before. I had broken the 2,000 mile mark and I realized the AT is so much more than just another hiking trail. For the first time I felt a connection between myself and the trail. I can't explain it, it's just something you have to experience for yourself. 
The 3 miles to the shelter passed quickly and when I arrived there were tents spread out everywhere. A good sign for those of us who don't like staying in the shelters as this means the shelter is full. However, the area around the shelter was already littered with tents and there were few spots available that would be suitable for the night. After looking around, I was able to find a decently flat spot with very few rocks and roots in the way. Definitely not an ideal tent site but it will do for the night. By the time I had my tent set up, Bon Appetite and Parakeet arrived. They were both able to find spots for their tents as well. Soon after I made dinner. By this time is was already 7:30. After dinner I walked down to the shelter with my 32oz High Life and found Bon Appetite (BA)  and Parakeet making their dinners. I sat down with them, cheered with BA who had also packed a beer out from town and took a big gulp. I had just earned my trail name. BA dubbed me as ""Champagne"" due to me carrying out Miller High Life from nearly every town we've been to since the start of the trail. High Life's slogan is ""the champagne of beers"" for any of you who didn't already know. We sat around for a bit longer before I felt like retiring for the night. After such a late night last night I was hoping for an early bed time tonight to make up for it. I headed off to bed and crawled in my tent right around 9 to write my journal entry for the day. It's now past 9:30 and I'm about falling asleep as I write.","Clingman's Dome

Expecting rain by 8am this morning, I made sure I was up early enough in order to get broken down and on the trail before it started. I was up at 6:30 and was headed down the trail by 7:20. This morning was definitely one of my quickest break downs yet. 
It began sprinkling a bit soon after I left. I was glad I started with my rain jacket on so I didn't have to stop to dig it out. Once I start moving in the morning I really don't like to stop until I'm going to take a break for lunch or until I'm done for the day. Not long after the rain began I started to hear thunder. Once I got out on to the ridge I was able to see some lightning and it made me feel a bit uneasy as I was about to climb over the top of a 5,700ft mountain. Not exactly the type of place you want to be in a thunder and lightning storm but thankfully by the time o reached the top it had stopped. The wind and fog persisted however and made me race towards the shelter for the night. After climbing up over the mountain I found a decent spot out of the wind to stop and take a break for a quick breakfast. I waited for Kinsman to arrive and we both ate a bit and then continued on our way. The trail continued to climb up for small sections and the drop right back down. Today was a day full of what we call PUDs or pointless ups and downs. We descended just as much as we climbed. It certainly better than climbing all day but it can get a bit old after awhile. 
I ended up doing a really quick 12.1 miles to Tri-Corner Knob Shelter where we planned on spending the night. I arrived slightly before 12:20 and was impressed with my 12 miles in 5 hours. I easily could've pushed on to the next shelter another 8 miles ahead to make for 20 mile day but shortly after I arrived it began to rain heavily. I was glad to have made it just in time to avoid getting wet. About an hour after I got to the shelter Kinsman arrived. It looks like we will both be sleeping in a warm dry shelter for the night tonight. So far this afternoon I've just been sitting around, hanging out and chatting with some other thru-hikers here as well as some section hikers. Everyone is glad to be out of the rain and most are looking forward to getting out of the Smokies soon. We are planning on getting to Davenport Gap Shelter tomorrow which is 14.8 miles away but mostly downhill. With what looks like good weather for the day it should be an easy hike tomorrow. After Davenport Gap we will be exiting the Smokies and couldn't be more thrilled to do so. The shelter rule through this section of the trail has ticked me off beyond belief and I can't wait to be able to camp where I want again. 
Right now I'm not sure if BA and Parakeet ended up moving out of camp this morning. Hopefully they will arrive soon and get a spot in the shelter as well.","Ice Water Spring Shelter

Short post today
After a restless night in the shelter I managed to get up at 6:20 to my alarm and was out of camp by 7. With nearly 15 miles to go I wanted to get a quick start on the day before it got hot. To make things a bit easier, most of the day consisted of dropping in elevation. We ended up going down nearly 5500ft.
The day started off with a short climb up Tri-Corner Knob where I was rewarded with a beautiful view over looking the valley below. There wasn't a cloud in the sky and you could see for miles. I quickly caught up to Kinsman who had left a half hour before me and we started to drop in elevation. By 9:30 we had gone nearly 8 miles and we stopped at a shelter to have some breakfast. After a half hour break we continued on our way and continued to hike downwards. We eventually came to a nice spot to stop and take a break. I checked to see if we had any cell service. With a few bars of service we decided to give mom a call and see how she was doing and to catch up. It had been a few days since I had last talked to her so it was nice to talk on the phone for a bit and see how things were going at home. 
It was past noon by the time we were done on the phone and we had a few short miles to go to Davenport Gap Shelter where we would be staying. We took off and had the day done with by 2:30. We claimed our spots in the shelter which we had no desire to stay in and sat around for the afternoon. BA and Parakeet arrived much later around 7:30 but we were able to make some room for them to fit in the shelter as well. It was a full house for our last night in the Smokies and I knew I wasn't going to get a good night of sleep again.
Tomorrow we get to finally leave the Smokies and their nonsense behind.","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter

Another long night in the shelter last night. At least it was the last required stay in a shelter for the rest of the trip. My stays in shelters will now only occur if it is to get out of the rain for a night. Tossing, turning and listening to people do the same and snore all night does not add up to a restful night. Not having a restful night leads to having a long freakin day on the trail just like I did today.
I was woken up around 5:30 by several other hikers who lacked any common decency. They didn't hesitate to make as much noise as they wanted as they were packing up and getting ready. I managed to fall back asleep for 30 minutes or so and then woke back up. Instead of trying to go back to sleep I put my headphones in and listened to some music to get my day started. After a half hour of music I began breaking my gear down. Kinsman had already left the shelter to get an early start and BA and Parakeet got up soon after myself. Due to being tired, groggy and somewhat irritated with others I moved quite a bit slower during my breakdown than usual. I putzed around and ended up waiting for BA and Parakeet to be ready to leave before heading out. We started the morning together and we're all planning on stopping at the Standing Bear Hostel along the way to grab some food. We headed downhill for a mile and then we hit the northern end of the Smokies. I couldn't have been happier to finally be leaving the GSMNP. It was wet, cold and miserable for most of our duration in the park. My favorite part of the whole park was the trail on the way out of it. After leaving the Smokies we continued on a way and came to I-40 where we had to cross underneath the major interstate and continue back on to the trail. Soon after crossing the interstate we got to the hostel and we're rewarded with cold sodas and food.
We all sat around the hostel for about an hour as we ate, drank, and chatted with other hikers who were doing the same thing as us. By the time BA and I left it was 11:30 and it was starting to get hot. With a big climb of over 3000ft ahead I wanted to get on my way. Parakeet decided to stay behind to charge up some of her electronics. BA and I took off and began our climb. It was brutal right from the start and I knew it was gonna be a long afternoon. After pushing a little more than 2 miles I came to the first good source of water. There were a few other hikers grouped together looking at something that I couldn't make out from a distance. When I got closer they told me there was a large rattlesnake in front of them. I moved in closer and got a good look. This thing was huge compared to the snakes in used to seeing in NH. It had to be at least 4 feet long and several inches around. I was glad to have not come across it in the middle of the trail by myself while I was hiking. I watched it for awhile and then proceeded to get some water and eat some snacks. After 20 minutes of rest, BA walked in and was ready to take a break himself. We sat around for another hour before I decided to take off and finish the rest of the climb which was another 2.3 miles. Not too bad but it was steep and the heat of the day was draining my energy. After struggling with the mountain I eventually made the summit which was a nice grassy bald and had an FAA control tower at the top. I checked out the control tower for a bit and then started my decline into the camp spot for the night.
2.5 miles from the summit I arrived at Groundhog Creek Shelter. Not being required to stay inside of it, I happily trudged right on by and found Kinsman already setup in a perfect camp spot for the night with several spots for tents for myself, BA, and Parakeet. It was just after 4 when I arrived and I was beat the second I stepped in to camp. I slowly put my tent up and got evening chores done so I could relax the rest of the night. With my tent up, water filled, and gear arranged I started to cook my dinner which consisted of a chicken ramen and then a single serving mountain house beef stroganoff. I had them both down shortly after making them and began to feel a little more energized. I checked out places to stay in Hot Springs and booked a cabin for our group for Monday night and Tuesday night. It's going on 8 and there's been no sign of BA or Parakeet. They may have ended up setting up camp somewhere else along the way. Hopefully they will be able to catch up so they can stay with us in Hot Springs on Monday.","Davenport Gap Shelter

I can't even begin to explain how nice it was being able to sleep in my tent last night. I was able to sleep straight through the night with no noises to wake me up and it's amazing how much more rested I felt when I woke up at 6am this morning. I got right to breaking down my gear after I got up in order to get on the trail as soon as possible. After hiking in the heat all day yesterday I wanted to get a good chunk of the miles done before it got hot today. Kinsman left camp around 7 and I left about a half an hour after.
The hardest part of the day today was the first 6 miles. The trail went up and over several steep knobs just to drop back down and repeat the same. Eventually we got to the base of Max Patch, a well known spot along the AT for its beautiful open grassy summit with astonishing 360 views. After a short and somewhat easy climb to the top I dropped my pack and instantly laid down on the cool, green grass. It was beyond refreshing. I continued to lay on the grass while Kinsman and several other hikers behind him eventually made it to the summit. We ate a bit and enjoyed the views. Kinsman took off and I chose to continue enjoying the summit for a while longer. I would've loved to stay on top of Max Patch for the rest of the day but there were still 7 miles to go for the day. At high noon I took off down the trail which was headed down for quite a ways and within an hour and a half I had made it 5.5 miles to the base of Walnut Mountain. After a short break I headed up and quickly made the summit. Shortly thereafter I came across the shelter, walked a bit past it and found a great spot to set up my tent with plenty of room for Kinsman to pitch his hammock. He arrived a little after I finished setting up my stuff for the night. Now 4:15, he's just about finished setting up his home for the night and we will soon be relaxing for the rest of the day to prepare for tomorrow's 13 miles to Hot Springs.
I spoke with Bon Appetite via text message several times throughout the day today. He ended up camping a few miles shy of where we stayed last night. Parakeet was with him and they were planning on meeting us tonight. Regardless of where they stay tonight, we will all be in Hot Springs tomorrow in our own personal cozy cabin for a day of rest and chores. We all need to resupply for the next several days to get us to Erwin, TN. 
Things are going pretty well for me out here on the AT. Yesterday marked one month of being on the trail and although I'm not as far down the trail as I expected I would be at this point I'm happy with where I am and how things are going. I know days with bigger miles will come when we get to flatter areas and aren't climbing several thousand foot mountains everyday. I'm feeling stronger than I ever have in terms of physical strength in my legs as well as strength in my chest and lungs. My asthma seems to be getting better. I'm using my inhaler less and I'm able to push up mountains and over long distances without stopping to catch my breath. I have no injuries to speak of at the moment. My feet, legs and knees feel good other than the standard aches and pains that come with hiking all day, everyday. I know it's still early on in this epic adventure but if things continue to go the way they are now, I see myself standing atop the Katahdin sign in a few short months.","Groundhog Creek Shelter

The wind was whipping through camp last night and woke me up several times because it was so loud. It also rained pretty hard for a bit but by the time I woke up at 6:30 my tent was completely dry from the wind. Just as I woke up Kinsman was heading out. More rain was on the way and we wanted to make a good dent in the miles to Hot Springs. I quickly got my gear together and put away in my bag and was on my way at 7:05. I stopped at the shelter to check in with BA and Parakeet. They said they would be another 15 minutes so I headed on. I faced the biggest climb of the day right off the bat. It was a couple miles to the top of Bluff mountain and then down several on the other side. I quickly finished the climb and was happy to be done with the most challenging part of he day. From there on out it was easy sailing all the way to Hot Springs.
On my way down Bluff I stopped at Deer Park Shelter to take a break and fill up my water. By the time my break was over, Kinsman had passed me. I caught back up to him after a mile or so and we finished out the long descent into Hot Springs. It felt like it took forever! We could see the town from quite a ways off and I thought we would be there a lot sooner than we were. After grinding out the last couple miles we finally made it. We found the AT symbols carved in to the sidewalk and followed them straight through the middle of town. When we arrived at Bluff Mtn Outfitters in the center of town it was just after noon. I couldn't believe that we had both done over 13 miles by noon. Kinsman picked up his resupply box at the outfitter while I grabbed a pint of Ben & Jerrys half baked ice cream and devoured it. After eating we walked to the Hot Springs Resort and were able to check in early. 
After dropping off our stuff at the cabin we quickly figured out how many days it would take to get to our next resupply in Erwin and what we needed for food. Next we grabbed our dirty laundry and headed back in to the town. We dropped off our laundry in the wash, walked to the store, resupplied, went back to the laundromat and put our clothes in the dryer and then got everything back to the cabin once our clothes were dry. Just like that we had all our town chores done in a matter of a couple hours and were able to relax for the rest of the day. A little later BA showed up at the cabin and was happy to be done for the day. We hung out around the cabin for a couple hours and then headed to dinner. After dinner, Kinsman headed back to the Cabin while BA and I went to meet up with some other hikers to have a couple beers and enjoy some time by a fire. We stayed for a while and then headed back to the cabin to get some sleep.","Walnut Mountain Shelter

Today we took a zero in Hot Springs. With all my chores done I was able to just relax and heal for the day. Bon Appetite woke up not feeling well and spent the entire day in bed until dinner time. Kinsman and I hung around, did some catching up on trail journals, went through packs and food bags and eventually walked to the store to get some burgers, hot dogs and buns. Last night we decided we wanted to cook over our fire pit for dinner instead of going out to eat. We waited a couple hours once we got back with the food to begin cooking. I got a fire started around 6 and we were able to cook once there was a good base of hot coals. Bon Appetite managed to make it out of bed to eat some food which will probably help him out a bit. He did say he was feeling a bit better but he will be staying in town tomorrow and possibly Thursday as well. I heard from Parakeet and she will be staying in town tomorrow as well. Looks like the group is splitting up for a while but I'm sure we will all see each other again. Surprise of the day was running in to Jay and Sara. They pushed some big mile days and made it to Hot Springs this afternoon. They may be hiking out tomorrow morning like Kinsman and myself so maybe we will get to do some hiking with them now. Either way, I'm looking forward to getting back on the trail again.","Hot Springs

Got a good night of rest in the cabin last night. When I woke up at 7, Bon Appetite was feeling much better and had left to go get breakfast at the local diner. Kinsman was just about ready to hit the trail and did so within a few minutes of me waking up. I started gathering my stuff once he left and BA came back shortly after. He told me his plan of sticking around Hot Springs for the day today and then heading out tomorrow. I shot the shit with him until 9 when I decided I should probably get on my way. 
The trail left Hot Springs and crossed over a river and followed along the side of it for a while. There were people stealth camping all along the edge of the river until the trail began to climb. With a full load on my back from resupplying I was struggling to make my way up the mountain. I knew right then and there it was going to be a long, hard day. I slowly worked my way up and eventually the trail flattened out a bit and allowed me to pick up my pace. A couple miles in, I came across Damned Pond. The water looked gross and I was thankful that I didn't need water at the time. I decided to take a break for a bit and I called mom to see how she was doing. We chatted for a bit and then I continued on the trail. 
Flat ground didn't last long and I was soon making my way up Rich Mountain. I did a bit better on my way up Rich but by the top I was not feeling too great. My pace dropped to a crawl and I was getting worried I may have picked up whatever was ailing Bon Appetite. I sent Kinsman a text telling him where I was, that I was moving pretty slow and that I might need to stop at the upcoming shelter for the night which was only a mile and a half shy of where we planned on staying. I continued to make my way down the mountain and decided to take a break at the bottom to see if it would help me feel a bit better. After 10 minutes I got back up and began chipping away at the 1.7 miles remaining to the shelter. The break I took seemed to have helped as my pace had quickened a bit and I arrived at the shelter less than an hour later. Kinsman was there hanging in his hammock. I asked how he was doing and he said he was great to which I responded ""great enough to do another 4 miles?"" He looked at the map and agreed to the plan. What was supposed to be a 10.7 mile day just became a 14.4 mile day. We sat and rested for a bit and then began the rest of our hike for the day. By this time I was feeling almost 100% and we quickly busted out the remaining miles. 
We found a campsite just shy of a road crossing and decided to set up our stuff. Less than 100ft away from us is a general store so we popped in and grabbed some cold drinks and an ice cream sandwich for each of us. We've been sitting around for a little bit now and it's just about 5:45. I like to cook dinner right at 6 so that'll be coming up shortly. The rest of the night will be spent relaxing and looking at tomorrow's hike. Today may have started out poor and slow but it turned out to be a good day with a decent amount of miles.","Hot Springs

I was expecting it to be raining when I got up this morning but I was pleasantly surprised to find everything outside as dry as it had been when I went to bed. The wind had picked up quite a bit by the time I woke up and I could hear it rushing through the tree tops from inside my tent. When I crawled out I could see them swaying violently back and forth. 
I was on the trail by 7:30 and began making my way up the initial and biggest climb of the day. It was a several thousand foot climb but took place over the span of about 6 miles. As I made my way up, the trees continued to bend from one side to the other. I had several branches come down close to me and was actually hit by a small one as I was walking. As usual I had my headphones in while I was hiking and all of a sudden I heard some loud cracking near me. By the time I was able to look over to see what was going on there was a fairly large tree plummeting towards the ground. It landed with a loud crash and startled me quite a bit. Where it fell wasn't directly next to me but it was a little too close for comfort. I arrived at a shelter shortly after where I was able to take a short break, get water, and wait for Kinsman to catch up. The shelter was facing the wind so it didnt offer any protection or opportunity to warm up. After kinsman showed up I took off shortly after in order to warm up. The trail continued to climb after the shelter for a ways until. Once at the top it was easy walking on what was fairly level ground minus some little ups and downs.
A couple miles in, I came across a split in the trail. Left was a bad weather bypass while right took you up on an open ridge. Despite the high wind, I chose to take the exposed ridge. Along it there were several rock scrambles and once at the top there were pretty good views. There were several instances where the power of the wind knocked me off balance and I had to put my hands down on the ground to brace myself. I didn't stay on the ridge long and was soon on my way down to the shelter. I arrived about an hour later. I sat in the shelter awhile and waited for Kinsman to arrive. Several section hikers were sitting in the shelter when he arrived and we were under the impression it was full for the night. We went and set up our camp nearby only to find the shelter empty once we had finished. We decided to rip our gear down and stay in the shelter to get out of the wind and any possible rain.","Allen Gap

It ended up being a good choice to stay in the shelter last night. It rained for most of the night and continued to be pretty windy. It also wasn't a bad night in the shelter either. We were a little cramped from fitting 8 people in a 6 person shelter but no one snored and I was able to sleep through the night for the most part. 
I got up at 6:30 and managed to get out of the shelter at 7:15. Leaving proved to be a bit difficult because 2 guys had started a fire in the shelter fireplace. It was warm and cozy and I would've been content with sitting there for another hour in front of it. With rain on the way I decided to get moving to get closer to the next shelter. There was a short climb to start the morning but then the trail began to drop as I neared the next shelter which was 6.7 miles forward. I made it to the shelter in exactly two hours and caught Kinsman there. We sat around for a few minutes and then continued on to finish out the day. The trail continued to drop for another 3 miles and then we had another 5 of climbing to our shelter. 
We decided to stop and eat some lunch after the 3 miles to get some energy for the climb out. So far it had not begun to rain but the sky was starting to turn a dark grey and I knew it wouldn't be far off. I was less than a mile from the shelter and it started. I managed to get decently wet by the time I hit the shelter and I climbed in right away to get out of the weather. Kinsman showed up shortly after and we were once again glad to be staying in a shelter for the night. Tomorrow we are planning on a short 10 mile day, followed by another 10 on Sunday in order to make it a short 4 mile day on Monday to get in to Erwin. Then we will have all day to get stuff done in town and we won't need to take an extra day off.","Jerry's Cabin Shelter

Another good night to spend inside a shelter. It was cold last night and temps were well below 40 for the night. At times, I was chilled inside my 15 degree bag and was forced to ball up inside it and pull the hood over my head and face. We only had 7 people in this shelter so it wasn't cramped and we were actually able to move around.
Getting up was no easy task this morning. It was still freezing, the wind was blowing, and everything outside was soaked. Despite wanting to stay curled up in my sleeping bag for the day I knew it was important to get moving before the rain started again. With temps the way they were, getting wet would've been seriously dangerous as we were about to gain a lot of elevation meaning it would get even colder. I headed out around 7:30 and was moving as fast as I could to get to the next shelter. It was damn cold even while hiking which usually does a good job at warming you up but seemed to do nothing today. After a quick 2 miles I came to a interstate crossing at Sam's Gap where several trail angels had just arrived to give out some trail magic. I was hesitant to stop since I wanted to get to the shelter as quickly as possible. I ended up stopping and chatting for a little bit. I was generously offered a sugary snack, banana, orange juice, and best of all a rum and coke! I was thrilled and I couldn't believe I was having a mixed drink a little after 8 in the morning.. something I haven't done since my school career had ended. After finishing up my magic I continued down the trail. They had told me rain wasn't supposed to begin until 2pm so I relaxed a bit as I knew I would arrive well before then. 
The trail began to climb as I pushed my way up Big Bald Mountain. As I climbed temps began to drop more and more and before I knew it I was hiking in freshly fallen snow. I couldn't believe it. Snow.. in Tennessee... in May..... I thought it was supposed to be hot down here in the south. What gives!? As I continued, the snow got deeper and deeper and as I made the summit of the Bald it was a complete white out. The wind was whipping, it was maybe 35 degrees, fog had set in and I couldn't see more than a few feet in front of me, and the grass was completely covered in snow. I couldn't even see the blazes and I was now following Kinsmans footprints in the snow. Thankfully the shelter was less than 2 miles ahead at this point and I raced there to get out of the weather. I made it there just after 11 to find an empty shelter other than Kinsman. We set our gear up inside and we're glad to be out of the weather. 
With nothing else to do I got in my sleeping bag and rested for most of the day. As the day progressed, weather took a turn for the worse and it began to snow, sleet, and hail. Other hikers arrived throughout the day and the shelter began to fill up. People were wet, cold and could've been in some serious danger had they stayed out in the weather. We spent the rest of the day hanging out with some great people in the shelter. One hiker, Daddy Longlegs, had his dog with him named Cole. It was nice to spend some time around another dog but it made it more difficult for me to not be with Zealand. I ended up spending a good portion of the night thinking about her and felt the pull of home. I stared at the picture I have of her in my guidebook for several minutes and came to the realization that if there's anything that's going to make me leave the trail, it's going to be her. The physical aspect of hiking the trail is not all that difficult. Sure, there's hard mountains to climb and there's no doubt this is no vacation but that's not what will make me quit. All I can do now is look forward to getting to NH where I will be able to take her out on the trail with me. Feeling down, I put her picture away and got out of the shelter. For a brief moment, the sun powered its way through the fog and clouds just as it was setting below the mountain range and everyone was stunned with its beauty. The sky lit up in red, orange, yellow and green colors which instantly lifted everyone's spirits as we gazed at it in awe. We managed to get a fire going despite the conditions and spirits continued to rise. After enjoying its warmth for a bit I retired to my sleeping bag and was quickly asleep.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

We woke up to some more cool weather this morning. Expecting to only do another 10 miles or so to put us in range of Erwin we took our time getting ready this morning and didn't end up leaving the shelter until 10am. 
Kinsman and I left at the same time and began making our way to the next shelter about 10 miles down the trail. Most of the day was downhill travel so it made for pretty easy walking. Before we knew it we came to a Gap about 5 miles in and we're greeted by a man named Rob. He was giving out trail magic which was made up of cold sodas and sugary snacks. We talked for a bit and found out he would be in Mass in a couple months doing magic up there as well. He even takes hikers home to his cabin every night while he's there. We bid farewell and made our way the next 5 miles to the shelter where we planned on staying. We were both feeling good so we decided to push on a bit further and even considered going all the way to Erwin. Daddy Longlegs and Cole showed up as well and he was thinking the same thing. We all pushed our way up and over one last climb and made our way down the mountain and ended up walking straight in to Erwin. Turns out we did our biggest day yet of 17 miles. 
The 4 of us continued along the AT a short ways and found a good spot to set up shop for the night. After our gear was all set up we made our way in to town to go to Huddle House for some breakfast for dinner. Someone had mentioned having waffles and bacon earlier in the day and since then we had all been craving it. With our hunger satisfied we headed back to camp, got a fire going and relaxed around it for a couple hours. After that we all headed to bed and called it a night. Tomorrow we get to zero now instead of nearo which I'm sure my legs will appreciate.","Bald Mountain Shelter

Champagne ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564867,"Hello all.. I'd like to start off by apologizing for taking so long to make an update here on trail journals. I've been back at home in NH for going on a week now and can now say that my journey along the AT has come to an end. After a couple days in Erwin I decided I wanted to leave the AT and end my attempt at a thru-hike. It was not a decision that came easily and I am still unsure if I made the right decision. I suppose only time will tell. 
There wasn't one sole reason that resulted in me leaving the trail but several small aspects of the trail that I had come to dislike that ultimately led to me wanting to leave the trail behind. First and foremost, I was missing Zealand a whole hell of a lot. Those of you who have followed along know that I had days where I missed her dearly. I continued to have those feelings on most days. I found myself staring at the photo I had of her in my guidebook several times a day for long periods of time just wishing that I was at home spending time with her. This feeling peaked on my last night on trail at Big Bald Shelter which was shared with Daddy Longlegs and his faithful companion Cole. While I felt joy being with another dog on the trail, it led me to missing Zealand that much more and the following morning while hiking I couldn't keep my mind off her. 
Aside from missing Zealand, I began to dislike other aspects of the trail. To me, it seemed as though hiking the AT was no longer just hiking but had evolved more in to a race. I was waking up every morning, breaking down my gear as fast as I could and getting started down the trail before most other hikers in order to get to the next destination before them. It was unpleasant, unenjoyable and it sucked the fun out of what was supposed to be a pleasant experience. This feeling of racing along the AT did not just appear out of nowhere. It began when temperatures began to drop and dangerous weather presented itself. It was no longer a leisurely stroll to the next shelter but a race to get there in order to stay warm, dry and out of the elements. This feeling can't be blamed on the trail itself however. This is a feeling that I developed on my own and I'm sure there are others who have never had this issue before. 
Another aspect I disliked was the overpopulation of people on the trail. I went into the AT knowing fully well that there were going to be hundreds of other hikers out there at the same time but I was confident that I would be able to keep away from them. Such was not the case, and I was constantly running into other hikers when I would have preferred to be alone. The Appalachian Trail is a social trail without a doubt. As I've said before, I'm not the most social individual. I have a small but tight group of friends that I spend time with here back at home. Outside of that friend group I rarely interact with others unless I'm at work. Something that goes hand in hand with the social aspect of the trail is the trails culture. I grew to dislike the constant conversation that seemed to dominate all other topics of conversation on the trail. First question asked every time you meet someone is ""whats your trail name?"" usually followed by ""how many miles are you doing today?"" and typically at some point ""how much does your pack weigh?"" will come up. This was the recurring conversation that I faced every single day, multiple times a day. It gets old... really fast. It got to the point where I didn't want to take my headphones out when I would come across new people but knowing fully well that I would see them again at some point I did not want to come off as being rude.There were several other reasons why I chose to leave the trail other than the ones that I listed above but the ones I have spoken about are the ones that carried the most weight on my decision. I don't feel the need to ramble on about the remaining reasons so I will leave it at that.
With all that said, I can't say that I didn't enjoy my time spent on the AT. I saw some really cool places, spent a lot of time with my dad that I otherwise wouldn't have done, went on my longest and furthest backpacking trip yet, and met and spent time with some great people who I wish all the best on the trail and in life thereafter. Bon Apetite, Murph, Jay & Sara, and Paruhkeet, you guys were the few I came to know, respect and enjoy spending time with while on the AT. I know you are all going to make it all the way to the end and on the off chance any of you stumble across this, let me know when you get to NH. 
When I first got home, I had thoughts of starting back up on the trail in a couple weeks heading SoBo from Katahdin once the mountain opens up. I've since put that idea to rest and I am content with doing my hiking here in NH with Zealand on the trails I've come to know and love. I've also begun looking at summer work and career possibilities and am looking forward to pursuing my goals outside of hiking. 
I want to thank each and every one of you who followed my journey along the AT. Many of you sent me very kind messages which always brightened my day when I received them. For any of you who are contemplating hiking the AT, do it. It doesn't matter how far or how long you go, just get out there and start walking. I'm glad I did and its certainly an experience I will never forget. 
Within the next few days, I will be doing a post with gear reviews for my equipment that I was given by theThru-Hike Syndicate companies for any of you who may be interested or are looking for gear for your own epic adventures. They will be honest and I will tell you exactly what I did and did not like about each piece of equipment.
Farewell,

William","Erwin
