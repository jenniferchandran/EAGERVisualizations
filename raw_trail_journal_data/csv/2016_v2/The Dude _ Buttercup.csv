The Dude & Buttercup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479884,"I wasn't sure when to start a journal, but I guess there's no better time than today!   I decided January 1, 2015 would be the day that I began preparing for my thru hike.   I spent much of the last 18 months researching what it takes and how I would accomplish this goal. Now it's time for action!",,So excited....,"Jan 06, Tue",0
The Dude & Buttercup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479885,"I have 2 awesome boys that are my life.   My oldest, Kyle, will be taking on this adventure with me (Now that he's found out it's not all old people like me on the trail) My very cool dad will be starting with us in GA and will be met in Franklin, NC by my mom and sister (assuming he gets off the trail, but don't tell my mom that or she won't let him go haha)My dad and I have done a few backpacking trips and have more planned for this Spring. My son and sister will be joining us in May when we go to Max Patch.   We hiked that area last May but will be backpacking it this year.   3 generations on the trail. ..life is good!",,3 generations,"Jan 06, Tue",0
The Dude & Buttercup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479887,"My oldest son started thinking about thru hiking after this trip to Hot Springs.   With views like this, how could you not want to spend 6 months living in the midst of it. It poured on us during that trip, but even that we turned into fun. I know we'll get sick of rain, bugs, heat and being to cold, but I think the amazing days in between will keep us moving forward.",,View Entry,"Jan 06, Tue",0
The Dude & Buttercup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479892,Trying to get my journal to activate.   Maybe it will work tomorrow.,,View Entry,"Jan 06, Tue",0
The Dude & Buttercup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479905,"Now that I've gotten the journal up and running, I'll tell you a bit about us and our plans. This is my dad. I like to call him Mr. Awesome, but my sisters refer to him as T.O.M. (The Old Man), which is probably why I'm his favorite haha. My dad and I started doing some hiking together a couple of years ago and decided to add some backpacking into the mix. We've had a lot of fun learning, reading and just getting out there and trying...oh and of course shopping for gear! Even when it's raining we've enjoyed the time.My plan is to thru hike the AT starting April 1, 2016.   My dad will be starting at Springer with us and hiking up until Franklin, NC. My mom and sister, Cindy, will meet us there. At that point, Kyle and I will continue on North.",,Mr. Awesome aka dad,"Jan 07, Wed",0
The Dude & Buttercup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479908,"My mom is the best! I know she misses my dad when we're gone yet she smiles and cheers us on anyway. We have a few trips planned for this Spring already.   To say ""thank you"", my dad and I are taking mom to Asheville for vacation this Spring.   We promise not to take any hikes while we're there. Wish us luck!!",,Mrs. Awesome,"Jan 07, Wed",0
The Dude & Buttercup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480034,"My oldest son, Kyle, affectionately known as K-man to grandpa, will be thru hiking with me. Kyle will be 21 by the time we leave and is trying to figure out what he wants to do in the future.   Oh to be young and have your whole life ahead of you.   I hope whatever he decides, he lives the life he wants and lives it to the fullest!",,K-man,"Jan 10, Sat",0
The Dude & Buttercup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480036,"Ahhh my bashful little Z'er. Trying to find a picture of him is not that easy.   Z, aka Zach, is my baby.   He hasn't hiked with us yet but plans on it this Spring.   His brother told him how much fun he had with grandpa and me so now he wants to try. But if you see us out on the trail this year you'll know which one is Zach. He'll be the 6'1 boy trying to hide behind his very short mom!",,Zach Attack,"Jan 10, Sat",0
The Dude & Buttercup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480037,"We've got a few trips for this Spring planned so far. Dad and I will be heading to Croatan National Forest before the bugs and snakes start coming out.   I'm excited about that trip because 1) it's coming up soon! 2) It'll be something different from previous trips.   I love exploring new parks and trails.Our second trip will be with Kyle and my sister, Cindy, up around Max Patch.   We hiked that area last year, but will be backpacking it this year.   I'm ecstatic about that!! Our third trip we have planned will be dad, Kyle, Zach and me.   I think I'm most excited about this.   To be out on the trail with the 3 most important guys in my life will be awesome!!!! This trip will be up to the Grayson Highlands.   I'm really hoping to see the wild ponies. And of course we have the trip to Asheville with mom.   That's going to be a different kind of fun! Dad and I keep telling ourselves we won't go hiking while we're there. This trip is all about mom! And dad may have said something about the cost of alimony....",,Upcoming plans,"Jan 10, Sat",0
The Dude & Buttercup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483183,"Dad and I got some miles in this week.   I'm so glad Spring is here and the time has changed!   I got to try my new pack. So far, so good. And before anyone says anything about my poor posture, he snapped the pic while I was adjusting the straps.   Kyle had to work a lot this week and was not happy that he missed 2 days of hiking with us. Hopefully next week our schedules will work out better.   Really I should say his schedule.   Dad is retired and my full time job only requires me to work 7-8 days a month. Dad and I are headed to Croatan this week for 2 days and 20 miles.   It's supposed to rain, but at this point I don't think either of us care....just happy to be getting out there!",,New pack,"Mar 09, Mon",0
The Dude & Buttercup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/485726,"I can't believe we'll be leaving for Georgia one year from today.   My dad and I went to Croatan National Forest a couple of weeks ago. It was a good trip overall, but we underestimated the trail. With all the mud and water it made the 22 miles more difficult than I thought it would be.   Also, only 1 of the 3 wells were functional and I may have gotten us off trail and extended our road walk by a mile or so. I still had a great time though. Kyle and I are busy buying gear and preparing.   Mom is learning how to dehydrate now that she learned she actually has a dehydrate function on her ovens. Dad's learning the importance of drinking enough fluids.Overall, everyone is staying busy.",,And so the countdown begins....,"Mar 29, Sun",0
The Dude & Buttercup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/493155,"We spent a few days in the mountains this week and hiked from Max Patch Rd to Hot Springs. Met a lot of very nice people and learned a lot about gear we still want to buy. We both decided we want 20° underquilts! We packed way to much food even though it was only 2000-2500 calories.   I think we'll start with a little less for the first week or so and then add more.All in all it was a great trip out with my dad and sister along to help us out. Kyle and I both decided on our trail names. His is from a movie and mine is my new mantra to get me up the mountains. ""Suck it up Buttercup and get your a$$ up that hill!""Next we are off to Virginia for a 40 mile hike with my youngest son.   I can't wait!",,Prep hike,"May 07, Thu",0

The Dude & Buttercup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519123,"Getting so close I can almost smell the mountain air! Dude and I have moved in with my parents (poor mom with all of this gear in the house!) I have 17 shifts left at work, not that I'm counting  67 days or 408 hours of work left *coughcough* It may be 384. Dude and I went to South Mountain State Park for an overnighter to test out some gear. It was rainy which made the waterfall all the more beautiful! The Frogg Toggs worked well. We both stayed toasty warm. Now if we can just figure out these tarps and having better coverage. It's definitely operator error on that. We'll figure it out soon. We will be heading out again soon to test the quilts during cold weather. We're hoping to use a layering system to keep our baseweight down.",,Getting closer!,"Jan 05, Tue",0
The Dude & Buttercup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525623,We finally arrived in Georgia late in the afternoon. We started at FS 42 and headed south to the terminus. Cindy drove us down and stayed for the night.,"

The Dude & Buttercup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528305,I'm still not feeling well. I've tried so many different allergy medicines and nothing has worked. Staying at Lance Creek was interesting. Lots of slopes! Finding a place to hang the hammock without walking a half mile felt nearly impossible.,"Lance Creek

The Dude & Buttercup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528306,We had a really nice day hiking. I'm not sure if Cindy is regretting her decision to join us.

The Dude & Buttercup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528308,"We made it! Food!!! The Dude made it down first, of course, and found the cold beer. The descent into the NOC was a little rough but fun. The stay in a cabin and a hearty meal made it all worth it. Our hiking partner and sherpa will leave us tomorrow after breakfast....mmmm pancakes.","Wesser Bald Shelter
