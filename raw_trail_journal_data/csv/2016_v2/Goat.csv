Goat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529668,"Day one. I got an early start so it was a little chilly but that quickly changed. All I can say is there seemed to be a lot of up! I arrived at the Manassas gap shelter within about one hour and took a break. I leisurely hiked up to Dicks Dome shelter, taking breaks along the way. I met a lot tog really interesting people to include a couple who know a lot of the same people I do...weird. The biggest lesson for today was that I am carrying too much. I have already been able to shave off at least 7 pounds just by carrying less water (only carry what I need). There may be some things that get put in the mail box when I hit Harper's Ferry. Ok. All for now.","route 66 front royal

Goat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529820,"So today was day 2. It took me a little while to get out of the shelter and back in the trail - feeding, packing, foot maintenance, etc but I finally made it out at 0900. It was pretty easy - for the first 5 miles. I ate lunch past the halfway mark - around Higheay 50 - at Ashby Gap. I then went back to a lot of ""up"". I eventually made it to the shelter around 4:00. It's pretty nice - I am accompanied tonight by Shadow. Come to find out, he hails from my next if the woods originally too. As I was walking through the first half of the day, I came upon a clearing of sorts where a bunch of other feeder trails intersected. There wasn't a lot of underbrush and it was easy to see out over the mountains and the rest of the valley. I had a big grin on my face because it was simply beautiful; to be able to walk through this trail - the same way our forefathers did during the civil war. Being out here hiking on your own, it's really easy to start thinking about that stuff. Tomorrow I head out to bears den - ten miles through the roller coaster and possible rain and thunderstorms!","dicks dome shelter
