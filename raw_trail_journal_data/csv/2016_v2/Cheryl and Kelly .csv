Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518667,"We are keeping a blog so our families, friends and students can keep track of our adventure. We have fielded many questions about this endeavor and hopefully this post will answer the important ones...The Appalachian Trail is a nearly 2,200 mile hiking trail through the Appalachian Mountain Range in the Eastern United States.It is the longest ""hiking-only"" footpath in the world. It is also among the longest continuously marked trails. The AT is marked with approximately 165,000 2"" X 6"" inch white blazes along the trail guiding hikers the entire way.The AT travels through 14 different states. The southern terminus is Springer Mountain, Georgia and the northern terminus is Mt. Katahdin, Maine. The AT cuts through the oldest mountain range on the planet.It is is largest and longest running volunteer conservation project in the world. Thousands of volunteers contribute roughly 240,000 hours to the AT every year. This amounts to over 10,000 days of volunteer work from 5,617 volunteeers.There are more than 262 three-sided shelters along the trail.The elevation gain/loss of hiking the entire AT is the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest 16 times.It is estimated that about 99% of the entire trail has been either relocated or rebuilt since its creation in 1937.",,View Entry,"Dec 23, Wed",0
Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518666,"A little about us...
We are in our early 50's and have 3 grown children. Our oldest is helping with our mail drop schedule (she loves spreadsheets and numbers), our middle is taking care of our house and mailing our resupply packages, our youngest is a junior in college.
We are both teachers. Kelly teaches high school math and is taking a leave beginning at the end of February. Cheryl teaches kindergarten and has taken the whole year off. We are leaving at the end of February to give ourselves enough time to be finished by the beginning/middle of August because we need to be back at work the last week of August.
We sold our house in Mass in July and live in an apartment in Mass so we can work and have a house in NH which is now our main home. We live 6 miles from the trail head for Mount Moosilauke. 
A question that gets asked often is, ""Why do you want to do this?"" Some thoughts...
-When I was little my dad had a book with pictures of the AT and I thought it was ""cool"". My husband and I have hiked many sections of the AT and then I got obsessed (this happens to me). We hiked a section from Mount Greylock in Mass to Hanover, NH and he got the ""backpacking bug"".
-I want to know if I am capable of doing this hike end to end,
-Can I physically hike 2000+ miles?
-Am I mentally capable of being challenged, bored, uncomfortable?'
-Can I stay (happily) married while hiking 2000+ miles with my husband? 
How I will feel when I finish this thru hike:
-proud of myself knowing that I did something that was hard and stuck to it
How I will feel if I quit:
-embarrassed that I didn't have the staying power to finish,
-disappointed that I let myself and my husband down",,Home,"Dec 24, Thu",0
Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518930,"New Year's Eve day hike: We walked a familiar 5 mile stretch on the AT near our house in the snow. We were the first to walk so had to be careful to look for white blazes on trees that were white from snow. We didn't get misdirected but stopped and backtracked twice because we thought we were misdirected. 
Take away: It was great and I know that my winter hiking gear was warm and comfy.
New Year's Day hike:Its a tradition near where we live to climb Mount Moosilauke on New Year's Day. Our neighbors were telling us about it so we did our first annual New Year's Day hike. It was in the twenties and there was snow on the ground. We didn't leave until 9am so we just followed everyone else's bootprints to the top. It was cold at the top and 25 mph winds. We took a selfie and then headed back down into the woods to stop for a snack.
Take away: My gloves kept my hands warm. My water froze in my water bottle so I was drinking chunks of ice. 
We had fun and were quicker than we thought we would be.

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519440,"We are going to dehydrate most of our food for our thru hike. We have read the pros (having healthy, more inexpensive, and foods I will eat) and the cons (need to be more schedule conscious, could get tired of the food we have packed). After a lot of discussion, I like to discuss things A LOT, we think this is the best decision for us. I have found 13 recipes and have made a trip to BJs, the food store and have the dehydrator going. 
It's exciting to be preparing food for our adventure!",,View Entry,"Jan 11, Mon",0
Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519908,"I am a worrier...I can worry about big things and little things and too many things! Today's worry is the weather. As I scurried from warm home to warm car in the blustery and cold winter weather today, I started thinking about hiking at the end of February/beginning of March in the northern Georgia mountains and the Great Smoky National Park and I began to ....worry...a lot.So, I unpacked my backpack and looked again at my gear. I have a warm base layer top and bottom, a fleece jacket. and rain pants and top, a fleece hat, a balaclava, warm gloves with a mitten overlayer. And still I worry. These were good enough to keep me warm on a cold New Years Day hike up Mt. Moosilauke but I also headed homw and took a warm (hot) bath. That won't be an option on the trail.When we get into camp, I have warm camp clothes and a down jacket plus a sleeping bag with liner and a tent. My debate is I have a 20 degree bag and a 0 degree bag. I want the 0 bag because of the warmth but the weight and bulk of it is holding me back. I have looked around on the internet and found a camping hack that will help me stay warm. I am also going to sleep outside in my 20 degree bag this weekend in New Hampshire to be sure that I am feeling safe. My husband is more of a ""you will be fine and we can fix it if you are not"" person and I am a ""I want to try everything at least 10 times before I trust it"" person, so this should be an interesting couple hike.",,View Entry,"Jan 12, Tue",0
Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519909,"I am a worrier...I worry a little and then I worry some more and then I worry even more! My biggest concern (worry) at the moment is the weather. As I scurried from a warm home to a warm car in this blustery frigid New England winter weather I started worrying about the cold. 
So, I came home and unpacked my backpack and went through my cold weather gear. I have running tights, zip off pants, rain pants and wool socks for the bottom half of me. I have a running shirt, fleece jacket and rain jacket, liner gloves and warm over mittens for the middle half of me. I have a fleece hat and balaclava for the top half of me. There is a saying that you know what a hiker is worried about when you look through their gear. Yes, I am worried about the cold and I have a lot of stuff because of it.
I wore everything at one point or another when we hiked up Mt. Moosilauke on New Years Day (except the balaclava-I didn't bring it) and I was warm enough. Though the balaclava has been added because the stinging sleet and snow at the top convinced me that I would be happier with this addition. 
When we get into camp I have warm clothes, a down jacket and a sleeping bag.
My husband is a ""if it's not working, we will fix it as we go"" kind of person and I am a ""practice it here until we get it right"" kind of person. This should be an interesting couple hike. I will be sleeping outside this weekend in NH to be sure that my sleeping arrangement will keep me warm and safe-well I will settle for safe since it will be very cold this weekend.",,View Entry,"Jan 20, Wed",0
Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520509,"It's February! And we are going to begin our trek north in just 25 short days. The excitement and nervousness are really beginning to mount.
We have had a glitch in our pre-hike plans. Our family has been fostering children for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for 16 years. In anticipation of our hike we were only doing hotline (emergency overnight or weekend placements) since September. Unfortunately a precious 4 year old who has lived with us off and on for 3 years came back into care. We got the call and we said yes. His amazing social worker is finding him a forever home before we leave but this is adding a large degree of stress to our late planning stages. And we are not getting much hiking in. He is a good walker and has been on the AT near our home in NH but a 4 year old really can't hike far or fast.
I have been following Blizzard and Slipknot on trail journals and praying for better weather at the end of February but prepared if we have snowy cold conditions. Slipknot recommends yoga on the trail and suggested googling yoga and hiking for ideas. I found a post from Appalachian Trails that I had seen earlier and forgotten about. These seem like stretches that will help this older body have a more comfortable hike. Here is the link to Madison's post.

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521071,"For all my teacher friends who enjoyed (suffered through) the SEI class, here is our vocabulary list to help you better understand the blog. I will not take you through the 7 steps, I will just assume that as native English speakers you will be okay. If you have any questions, ask them in the guestbook section of the blog and I will answer them. Happy reading 
Trail Terms for those interested, this is several that we found informative and we will be using some of them. More to come and more out there:
2,000 Miler -- A Thru Hiker or Section Hiker who completes the A.T.
A.T. -- Appalachian Trail
AYCE --'All You Can Eat' Restaurants that offer all you can eat buffets are very popular with hungry hikers.
Bald -- A low elevation mountain surrounded by forest yet devoid of trees on the crown. typically covered with meadows, balds can offer great views and are a good place to find wild berries, they also attract much wildlife. A southern term.
Blazes -- are painted, 2-inch by 6-inch, vertical white rectangles that are placed at eye height on trees and other objects, in both directions, to mark the official route of the Trail. Side trails are marked with blue blazes. You see horizontal, diagonal, arrows, and other blazes along the Trail.
Blue blaze -- Spur trails off the AT to bad-weather routes, views, shelters, water sources etc are often marked by AT style blazes painted Blue.
Blue-blazer -- is a long-distance hiker who substitutes a section of blue-blazed trail for a white-blazed section between two points on the Trail.
Cairn -- A obviously manmade pile of rocks erected as a trail marker. Chiefly used above timberline. Should be close enough to see the next one in heavy fog, and high enough to see above fallen snow.
Double blaze -- Two blazes, one above the other as an indication of an imminent turn or intersection in the trail. Offset double blazes, called Garveys, indicate the direction of the turn by the offset of the top blaze.
Flip-flop -- a term used to signify a hiker that starts hiking in one direction then at some point decides to jump ahead and hike back in the opposite direction. Some hikers on the AT will start hiking northbound from Springer Mt. and usually at Harpers Ferry they may decide to go to Katahdin and hike back down to Harpers Ferry, thus completing their thru-hike. This is a good way for someone to still get their hike completed if they are behind and their time is limited due to the oncoming winter.
Harpers Ferry -- The ATC's National Headquarters and Information Center is located in Harpers Ferry WV, about 1000 AT miles north of Springer Mountain. A short blue blazed trail leads to HQ, where AT hikers traditionally sign the register and have their photo taken.Hiker Box -- A cabinet or box at hostels where hikers donate unwanted food for the hikers coming behind them.
Nero Almost a Zero ...in other words, a very short mileage day.
NOBO Northbound thru-hiker (Georgia to Maine)
SOBO Southbound thru-hiker (Maine to Georgia) Also a MEGA
PUDS -- is thru-hiker shorthand for ""pointless ups and downs"", referring to the less interesting sections of mountains thru-hikers encounter from time to time; several PUDS in a row are MUDS, which is shorthand for ""mindless ups and downs""
Purist -- A hiker who wants to pass every white blaze on the trail
Register -- A log book normally found at a trail shelter or a trail head. The original intent was for hikers to sign in so a searcher needing to find a lost hiker could tell where they last were.",,View Entry,"Feb 13, Sat",0

Work for stay -- Some hostels, the AMC Huts in the Whites, and a few other places along the AT allow some hikers to work in stead of paying the fee for lodging.
Yellow blazes -- Term used to denote the yellow center-line that is painted on a highway
Yellow blazer -- Someone who hitch hikes around sections of trail by following yellow blazes.
Yogi-ing -- is the good-natured art of ""letting"" food be offered cheerfully by strangers without actually asking them directly (If you ask, it's begging!)
YMMV -- Your Mileage May Vary', hiker jargon for 'this worked for me, but your results/opinions might not be the same.'
Yo-yo-ing -- is the act of completing one A.T. thru-hike, then immediately turning around to begin another in the opposite direction.
Zero day -- is a day in which no miles are hiked, usually because the hiker is stopping in a town to resupply and/or rest",,View Entry,"Feb 14, Sun",0
Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521159,"We were fortunate to be invited to the home of two thru hikers who gave us some great information and a fantastic dinner. They were not telling us how to hike but presented choices and what they did but no expectations that we would hike exactly as they did. 
Thanks for being excited about our hike, Baby Blue and Desolation and for taking the time to mark up AWOLs guide to show great places to stay and more importantly places NOT to stay.

Mrs. Anderson's class and Mrs. Ross's class made me cards-so sweet and yes I will have fun and remember to breathe! I will see you all in August when you are 2nd graders and I am a teacher again 
Kelly's classes had parties for him and he went out for dinner with colleagues this week.
Kelly sent out a link to our blog to both our schools. It's been really encouraging to read your kind words!
His high school buddies and fraternity friends are also sending encouraging messages-thank you!
We were so blessed to see KK looking good this week after a trying weekend  KK I can't wait to eat fun food with you when you and mom come to visit. Get well soon! 
We stayed at his Kelly's brother's house last night. It rained so hard that a major route was closed this morning because of flooding and downed power lines which affected traffic lights. Thank you for the ride to the airport Martha!
Here we go!
Josh from the Hiker Hostel picked us up and we had pizza and stayed in a shipping container tiny house! Check that off my bucket list

We shared with one guy on the first floor with us and there were three in the loft. Kinda noisy. I was toasty warm in my sleeping bag (thanks Courtney) but Kelly was a little chilly-he's working out the best way to use his quilt. There was artillery fire from the nearby Army base.
Climbed Justus and Sassafrass mountains- did okay but took some ""breath breaks"".
Came down into a gap and there was Courtesy and his wife with trail magic! I got a hot dog and a juicy crunchy apple . So good and made the next climb easier 
Met a nice guy from Texas named Chris but he's young and fast so we won't see him for too much longer.
There are ridge runners that walk parts of the trail and stay near the shelter. They are educating people about Leave No Trace policies. The young woman ridge runner thru hiked last year we think we just missed her when she was near Hanover.

There were four tent pads and they were full with two hikers set up under the bear cables. We were concerned that we would wake them up when we got our food but they got up and quietly hiked out at 3:30 am (we are hoping not to hike at night or that early!) 
We were able to chat with Jacob and Heather last evening. He is a seminary student in Kentucky. She is hiking with exercise induced asthma so these hills must be brutul. They both have great attitudes and are very friendly.
We were all sitting around cooking our dinners when a horse came down the trail. Not a common sight on the AT since it is a footpath and pack animals are forbidden.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Awesome to have a hot shower, clean clothes and a bed with sheets.Today they were calling for rain but we only had sprinkles. Good hiking except for the hike up Tensenate Gap- it was brutal. But there was awesome trail magic before the nasty climb. A church group hangs at the gap twice a week for 6 weeks giving out drinks and snacks. I had hot chocolate and two moon pies. Yummy!We are at a shelter with five other people because they are calling for storms tonight and maybe snow. Don and Adam hiked in a large blue tarp that they put across the opening and we added our tent footprint.

Thankfully the tarps kept most of the rain out of the shelter. It is cold this morning. People's tent zippers are frozen and our water bottles have lumps of ice inside. The wind is fierce and cold. Such a difference from the beautiful spring-like day of yesterday.Hiked in early; trying to be good about not overdoing things, so only did 7 nice miles today. Hopefully we won't be too bored waiting for darkness. Kelly and I play cards and I have a book.Met Irish Escape, Blue Bandana and GP. They had a hunting dog on a rope leash and were trying to meet up with the owner. He was out in the monsoon last night. Everyone is feeding him food from their bags but he's so hungry. Don called and left a message for his owner (he has tags on). The dog's trail name is Savage because he will eat anything and everything (except gumbo with okra). Savage spent the night in the shelter with the three of them and they are hiking him into town to the gap to meet his owner.Our stove didn't work at dinner but GP let us boil our water on his stove--nice kid.A little concerned about camping at the top of the mountain in these temperatures but we are in our tent and have good sleeping bags.Thinking about going into town tomorrow because they are calling for cold rain and we need fuel.

Georgia doesn't believe in blazes- 20 to 30 minutes can go by without seeing one, but they do build switchbacks. North Carolina had lots of blazes but few switchbacks. This was the hardest and steepest 7 miles we have done so far.

We had a fire and sat around chatting for awhile but by 8 everyone was in their sleeping bag and settling down. Beautiful clear night again but a bit nippy.Today's hike was so much better than yesterday's. Still a big climb but it was gradual and not straight up a mountain! The cold sides still have snow, slush and ice which can make the footing treacherous. I worry about falling off the steep side. The warm side of the mountain is sunny and the leaves are dry and crunch. The storm two weeks ago left a lot of blow downs that we had to maneuver around and under.
Not all the leaves are dry, though! You might not think you'd have much use for an engineering degree on the trail, but we found this little marvel and snapped a picture. The humble rhododendron is seriously underestimated as a water delivery system!

They built a fire and sat up late talking (8:30ish).We were awakened by dueling owls this morning. Their sounds were so sweet that it didn't even make you angry to be up so early.Most of today was a sweet walk in the woods. The middle section of Albert Mountain was tough- a rock scramble where your poles were a hindrance instead of a help. There was a fire tower at the top that made the harrowing (at least to me) climb worth it.The rest of the afternoon was the usual ups and downs. There appears to be a wild fire somewhat close by so paying attention to that situation. Excited to go to town tomorrow and take a shower! Six days hiking makes a person very stinky.

The shelter has trees come down on it a few days before we started our hike. No one was hurt and the maintainers got the trees cut down and the shelter repaired quickly.As our group finished cooking and eating another group came in. We were hoping they would keep going but they didn't. They were loud and obnoxious and their conversation wasn't appropriate.Short walk into town today and then town chores begin! Showers, laundry, lunch at a local diner, good resupply box to open and grocery store to browse then a walk around charming Franklin. Met up with our group at the Lazy Hiker Brewery and food truck. Awesome food and company! Then off to get milkshakes before bed!!! People here are so polite and friendly Off to bed early-ish since we hike out tomorrow. Shrink, Jelly Ankles and Cheetah are taking a zero--I hope they catch up soon. Brian and Norbert, the U Georgia guys, are back to work.

There was Cocoa Ken, Journey Man, Ishamel then Optimist Dream, Baby Chick, and the boys (two 18 year olds, a 17 year old and a 16 year old) came along. Bolt had made a nice fire but the boys were adding big logs that overhung the fire pit and sparks were going everywhere. My daughter Courtney would NOT have approved. There were not any tenting spots left so we had to shelter last night. The guy from Australia can snore! Some sprinkles overnight but the shelter had a deep overhand and we stayed dry.The hike today was a comfortable 106, setting us up for an easy walk into NOC for cheeseburgers, a shower, and bed. We thought about skipping it but it's a brutal 8 mile climb out so resting before the climb seemed like a good idea.There were beautiful views form the Wesser Bald Tower. We walked right past it  so after we got our tent set up I walked the one mile back and climbed the tower.

Yesterday his wife called and he is the national social worker of the year! He will be getting off the trail and going to DC for the ceremony. We have had great talks at rest stops and evening camp.Today was an easy 5.9 into the NOC. It seemed longer than it was because we were so excited about the rumored amazing burgers. We split a huge basket of onion rings, each had a burger and a salad. I think I will gain 10 pounds hiking.We have a nice house that we are sharing with Journeyman.

Cocoa Ken missed out again- his place didn't have laundry and was kinda sketchy. The man has no luck We did not have good luck getting a shuttle so we were going to hitch to the NOC for dinner. As we were walking down our driveway I saw two guys at their truck so I asked if we could pay them to drive us the mile and a half. They graciously took us for free. As the driver got in the truck, beer in hand, he reassured me it was his first. Journeyman and Santa rode in the bed of the truck and I chatted with the driver in the cab.Good dinner- tater tots and a large pepperoni and sausage pizza. Santa saw a trail runner so he asked him for a ride back to the cabin. Interesting ride- Santa and I lay in the back of the truck with his bike and other worldly possessions while Journeyman sat up front.Hike was really hard today. Straight up and out of the NOC in the rain. We got to the first shelter (6.9 miles) at 12:30 and it was cold and rainy so we didn't want to stop. There was a tenting spot 3.7 miles further along so we were going to spend the night there. A long slog up and down the gaps got us to a lousy tenting spot. We saw Cocoa Ken there and decided to head to Stecoah Gap and a hostel three miles away.It was a terrible three miles, it felt like we would never get there. A southbound hiker, who was smoking a cigar as he hiked, warned us it would be a ""gnarly hike"".Came into the gap, saw Cocoa Ken and some trail magic!

Today was a beautiful day. Well, it was overcast and very misty but the terrain was wonderful. We went the first twelve and decided to go farther. Three things determined this move: we did the twelve easily and early, the weather is getting very cold and we wanted to lose elevation, and I want a zero in Hot Springs. Things were great until the last two miles and they were hard, but we did it and hiked 19.8 miles!
We decided to go back to hiking together even though I am slower than Kelly. We missed each other.
In our tent listening to trail angels play music. They hiked in treats and hygiene items for the privy-norovirus going around. But it's 8:00 and they are still loud and we didn't get a shelter space. Usually we like to tent but it was a long day.

I had my first fall. I am super careful on the slippery rocks and roots but stepped wrong on a stick and down I went. More scared than hurt- thank goodness.The walk in the middle of our hike was, in my opinion, the most beautiful so far. It was gently rolling next to and over a stream. The stream had lots of small rippling waterfalls and the leaves on the trees were starting to turn green. Then we went to a road walk to the I-40 overpass. A couple from Wisconsin stopped and asked to take our picture. They had just read A Walk in the Woods.Then I saw a steep rock staircase that was crumbling and knew this was where we would reenter the woods.

We went to our tent to play cards, it was too windy at the shelter, but Santa took a nap instead because he didn't sleep well in town. I read my book . Had a few anxious moments because the trees were swaying violently in the wind and we were in this teeny tiny tent, but nothing fell on us and we survived the night unscathed. Santa woke at 5:30 just as the storm began. We foolishly didn't eat dinner-won't do that again.
This morning we woke to a misty forest. It reminded me of a Winnie the Pooh episode our girls liked to watch when they were little.
Some vertical climbs today which weren't appreciated. I really wish NC believed in switchbacks. We wanted to stop for ice cream at Mom's but got to the gap too early. From what other hikers told us tonight, it was a good miss. Two gaps later we walked a 1/2 mile to a hostel/general store only to find it closed. Not too excited about the extra mile!
We lunched at Little Laurel Shelter- pepperoni, cheese, crackers and a meal (chicken, veggies and stuffing). Good thing we fueled up because there was another vertical climb! Then we got to the part of the trail that had a bad weather bypass because it was a ridge walk. It felt like hiking in New England except instead of stunted evergreens there were stunted rhododendrons. 
Then it was a relatively easy walk to our shelter for the night. Hung our tent, rain fly and footprint to dry, got water, cooked dinner, put up the tent and hung out and chatted with other hikers.

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526060,"We met an interesting hiker named Red Bear. He seems to have all kinds of adventures. He really likes to night hike. Janes Bald where we were having trouble staying upright because of wind, he actually got blown over twice. It was hard to listen and actually hear his stories because of his vocabulary- he curses at least every third word. Very distracting. He and Santa were discussing the physics of who had a tougher time going over the bald. They concluded it was Santa because I have a lower center of gravity, have less surface area and my pack cover doesn't catch as much wind. I still think it was harder for me.Santa left trail mix in his side pocket to eat after dinner but forgot about it. As he was packing up this morning he noticed that a mouse had a yummy snack last night?Today's hike should have been easier. We started with a steep hike over a bald that had ""numerous false summits"" but then we had reasonable terrain. Santa slipped on such wet, slippery rocks and roots and strained a muscle in his leg, his boots are falling apart and we are tired after two big days. So we did 18 miles in 10 hours but it seemed really difficult.We would still do those big days because it got us up and over Roan Mountain (6000) feet before the storm, but our legs are tired.We pulled into the shelter and there is no tenting available. It's a nice, newer shelter with enough room for the people that are here. Our water source is a waterfall which is pretty special.Clean Skittles is today's featured hiker. He got his name because he forgot about a packet of Skittles and they went through the wash. They stained his clothes but the stain is fading. Clean Skittles's mom sent him Easter candy to Uncle Johnny's and a new shirt because she noticed his was getting too big. He's really fast but likes to get to shelters, build a fire and socialize so we hope to hike with him a bit longer.","Overnountain Shelter

There were 4 of us on the lower level and 4 on the top- plenty of space. Great night's sleep.Today looked like an easy day and we were pretty excited. Semi big climb out of shelter and then lots of little ups and downs. We pulled into the first shelter for lunch and met a very negative man. He had started on Feb 14 and was disgusted by the cold, wind and rain. He also hates his relatives which is why he started so early. While Santa was taking care of some personal business, he turned to me and asked, ""Are you afraid of me?"" I answered ""No, you seem angry but not with me."" Who says things like that? Very happy to move on.We got to Laurel Falls and there were a lot of local people there since it was a sunny Saturday. The falls were spectacular.We climbed up to the shelter and it was kinda creepy. Very open and windy and too close to a road. So Santa, Cocoa and I made a mad dash a mile down the AT, a mile down a blue blaze trail and then half a mile road walk to Brown's Grocery and Braemar Castle Hostel. Nice place! Cocoa got a private room with shared bath and we got a private room and private bath. Clean sheets, a space heater and clean towels. So nice considering the places we have stayed lately.We walked into town and ate at a local diner, Laurel Fork Restaurant. Really delicious, well priced and good. And the waitress gave us a ride back to the hostel! I asked if we could call a cab and she volunteered to drive us to our home for the night.So I am fed, in a bed with sheets, showered, someone is washing my disgusting socks-all is well in my world!","Mountaineer Shelter

It had been closed for two years because of bear activity.Moved on and crossed a road with printed signs proclaiming trail magic. Came in and there were burgers, brauts, lemonade, soda, beer and bean salad. Some of our trail buddies stayed for a couple hours and just ate and ate. We, who are older and slower, stayed long enough to chat and eat then moved on.We got to our intended destination at 3:40 and said, ""we can do 7 more miles today."" So ate a quick snack and on we went. We went about 3 1/2 miles and stopped at a gap to get water and cook dinner and then walked in to Iron Mountain. Long day, good terrain, and lots of miles. We caught up with Magic, White Rabbit, Large and North Star.We went past the Watuga Dam today. It was beautiful and Santa likes dams as much as I like waterfalls.We met Ash for the second time and had some time to chat. She got her nickname because her hat reminds people of Ash Ketchum, from the Pokemon tv show. He's the one with the Pikachu  She isn't thru hiking because in May she needs to go to her boyfriend's graduation from grad school and she starts a job at a solar company in the Bay Area at the end of the summer.

Quick made it into camp about 8:40.Today we were hiking about 16 miles to the second shelter. It was a fairly easy hike and the shelter had so many black flies that we decided to move on to a campsite two miles from town to set ourselves up for an easy walk in. Then Santa says the magic words, ""I think we are getting a thunderstorm soon."" So I turned up the speed and we hiked our biggest day-26.3 miles in less than 12 hours. The last two miles into town were smooth and down Damascus is a quaint trail town. Lots of hostels and bed and breakfasts. But not very many places to eat Lots of hiker friends in town and we had a good dinner with Cocoa. The place we are is closed tomorrow night so we will have to do some exploring.Hiker highlight- QuickHe is a retired Navy guy. Joined out of school and went to college and then did intelligence work in Afghanistan. Very thoughtful and kind man who is going to law school when he's done with his hike.He rescued a couple who didn't know what they were getting into by flagging down a local to get them into town. The wife's plan of calling a cab to come get them when she had no service wasn't working.Quick met the woman from the trail couple at Spivey Gap. She had just finished an hour day section hike and was going to meet her friend who was going to pick her up but she had gotten lost.

It's a strange trail town- a few hostels, bed and breakfast places but not even a cheap motel to be found. Meal choices are pretty limited. We ate lunch at a gas station food bar which wasn't terrible. Dinner at MoJos was great but they close at 5 so it was an early one- we got a salad to go for our second dinner Spent today doing our town chores. We moved from our first B&B- there was nothing wrong with it but she doesn't do laundry. The only laundromat in town is closed. So we moved down the street to a retired kindergarten teacher's B&B where we could get our laundry done (thanks for the suggestion Quick). She doesn't serve breakfast though. Our first place had breakfast but not enough for these hungry hikers. Our plan is to stop at MoJos for food on our way out of town.Santa went to the clinic today to have a minor physical ailment checked out. He was impressed by their care and he is totally fine.We also bought new shoes. Mine never dry out and I have been having problems with blisters. Hoping this help that problem. Santa's boots were falling apart and he's pretty excited about his new trail shoes. I also bought him a hiking pillow. He tried mine and decided he would like one also.We also picked up our mail drop (thanks Kristin). It's always exciting to see what special treats she adds. Today it was brownies!People have asked about our trail names. Santa got his because he has a big white beard, had a belly when we started (he's lost 30 pounds since then) and he wants to be a mall Santa when he grows up.My trail name came to me when we were section-hiking Mount Greylock, MA to Hanover, NH. I had taken a class on wondering- how to engage the natural curiosity young children have and use it to help them learn. I started a lot of sentences with ""I wonder..."" and the trail name Wonder was given to me.Tomorrow we head into the mountains of Virginia. We hope to slow down a bit and enjoy the trail more.

But I did get a hot bath.Up at 7 this morning after a great night's sleep, packed up and went to MoJos for breakfast. We had sundried tomato bagels with scrambled egg, bacon and cheese sandwiches and then split an order of delicious blueberry pancakes. I really do love town food!The hike today was awesome. Good trails, reasonable terrain with just enough ups and downs that you knew you were hiking. We went over the Virginia Creeper Trail a few times- it's a rail trail and saw some bikers.We got into camp around 4 but stuck to our plan and didn't move on.

We woke up to a sunny sky and just started walking. Nice lunch break near a stream after a somewhat confusing road walk. Saw a sign on a trash barrel asking people not to put deer carcasses into the barrel because a 70 year old man and 78 year old woman maintain the trash barrels.Water was somewhat limited today. We filled up this morning and both carried 2 liters. The only other water was at a shelter .3 miles off the trail with a .3 mile walk to the water. Didn't seem worth it so we walked on. Got into the second shelter with zero water. I hate that! I seem to get thirstier the less water we have. But all was good and we got water, treated it and made dinner.Saw some hikers we haven't seen in awhile- Ghost, Thor, Phat sister, Bean and Ash. As we were finishing dinner and doing nightly chores, they came in, ate and got ready to night hike. They like to sleep in so they often hike by headlamp.Thor is a hiker from Ohio who works for One Feather, another hiker and his brother, as a landscaper. He is hoping to be in Harpers Ferry to celebrate his 21st birthday. Last Saturday we were hiking with him and he came into the shelter for lunch and started picking the garbage out of the fire pit. He had lost his hat and was hoping that doing a good deed would cause trail karma to return his hat. Not five minutes later Large walked in with his hat. It was quite the moment. Thor took a few days off because One Feather's wife drove from Ohio to visit and brought Thor's dad. Thor sent his stove home and is now eating only cold food.

He is the most decorated serviceman in American history.Tomorrow we see one of the most iconic photo ops on the AT: McAfee Knob. We are excited that we will be there tomorrow because rain is coming in Thursday and Friday. The only bummer is that we wanted to eat at the Homeplace Restaurant but it's only open Th-Sa. But it is what it is...Trail News: at Watuga, bears pulled down the bear cables and ripped two tents. No hikers were injured but they were shaken up. (I would have quit!)Shenandoah: a friend from home facebooked us and said they were on vacation there and picked up a hiker because there is a wildfire. We have a ways to go to get there so hopefully it will be all under control soon.Side note: when I was sitting on the side of the trail yesterday recuperating from my illness and thinking ""I am not mentally and physically strong enough to be a thru hiker"", I turned on my phone and saw 6 encouraging thoughtful messages from people following our journey.

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528979,"Great sleep at our stealth site. Up early for a long day of hiking. The morning was easy and the first part of the climb to Dragon's Tooth was sweet. There were switchbacks, old pine forest with protection from the sun and sweet smelling and soft pine needles underfoot. Then we started climbing straight up and over rocks-felt like we were in New England. I loved the climb up and around Dragon's Tooth. The climb down was very tricky and steep (technical in places) with rebar in the rock to help the descent. I employ the ""throw my poles down and scoot on my bum"" method at times. Santa did not enjoy himself.Then to a road crossing and a 1/2 mile walk to a gas station. I had a cherry slush, a bottle of crangrape juice, and a cheeseburger and fries. Santa had multiple sodas, chips and a cheeseburger. He got two Gatorades to go and I got devil dogs. Then off to climb 8 more miles to put us in position to get up early (5am) to see sunrise at McAfee Knobb. Desolation, a thru hiker, said it was ""biblical"".Unfortunately we can't go to the Homeplace for dinner because they are only open Th-Sa and we went through today. But we go into town tomorrow for showers, laundry, resupply and town food!Water has been a problem in Virginia. It hasn't rained and water sources are drying up and some are pretty sketchy. It's supposed to rain Friday so I hope that helps the water situation.We met a family of section hikers from Lee, MA. They are Jigsaw, Just Helen and Bumblebee. We met at the gas station where they also had lunch and they picked up some food for the next two days. They were out hiking for Bumblebee's school vacation week. She's a senior getting ready to go to Saint Michael's in the fall. Really friendly family. Bumblebee and Just Helen may also hike out early to see the sunrise.We also met a man on a Harley who has just finished cancer treatment. He's hoping to gain back the weight he lost and find some energy. He is appalled that Santa is not ""carrying a toy"" (gun). This man has a license to carry a concealed weapon- he showed it to me. He asked why we don't carry and all I had to say is ""we are from Massachusetts"" and he understood.There is a bird making bizarre noises outside our tent.

As we changed we looked at our legs and feet and were appalled at how filthy dirty we were. Back over to the shelter and down the hill to use his camp towel to scrub off the worst of the dirt. Feels nice to be semi cleanUp at 5 am to pack up and hike to McAfee Knob to see what was billed as a ""biblical"" sunrise. Unfortunately it was cloudy but the views were nice but not spectacular. We met a man who hiked in last night to see the sunrise. After chatting for a bit, we found out he lives in Uncasville, CT which is right near where I grew up. He took pictures for us and I took his picture to send to his wife.Then off we went to Tinkers Cliff. It was a pretty cliff walk with awesome views. We met a thru hiker named Bald Whistler. He is hiking a unique flip flop hike. He was trying to ensure good weather but said he has experienced spring, winter and summer already. He is hiking from Harper's Ferry to Damascus then NY to Maine then from Harper's Ferry to Damascus to Springer.We walked what Cocoa calls ""AWOL flats""- what is shown in the book as a flat walk is actually a series of steep but short ups and downs up on the ridge line. Not hard but frustrating. You go up just to come down, repeat...Today was another hot sunny day in Virginia. It was like the hiking we have done in southern California.The dirt in the trail is dry and cracked, water sources are scarce and sketchy, lots of little lizards and a SNAKE. I am happily hiking along when I see something on the trail and abruptly stop. Santa bumps into me and asks what the problem is. I just point and he walks around me to poke at it with his hiking pole. It doesn't move but it's tongue is flicking so he gently flips it off the trail. It doesn't move and I quickly move past it.We walk into town, drop our packs at the Super 8 and head over to Pizza Hut. We each ordered a medium pizza and sodas. Life is good when your belly is full of town food!Walked into town to get our resupply box at the outfitters (thanks for the treats girls) and to get Santa new shorts. Then off to the food store for some juice and snacks. We walk past the 3 Pigs BBQ and see some hikers we know- Ghost, Pilot, Spirit of 76 and others. They identified my snake as a copperhead. Thinking I might be rethinking the wisdom of this hike. People are trying to figure out if they are hiking out tomorrow. We are taking a zero to rest sore legs and recover from my stomach bug.

We went to the outfitter to get Santa new shorts (his are too big) and some Glide. Then off to Kroger's for extra food. We got bagels for me and tortillas and peanut butter for Santa plus our usual pepperoni, cheese and cracker lunch. And Santa got candy bars and Gatorade powder. While we were at Kroger's we saw Jigsaw, Just Helen and Bumblebee. They are fine with their section hike and heading home tonight.Then off to the gas station for lunch. It's a little scary how often we eat at gas stations these days. I took a nap and Santa shared all the photos we have taken to our kids. Courtney will add pictures to the photo section of our journal (thanks Courts!)Then to the Three Pigs BBQ for dinner where we met Ghost, Spirit of 76 and Pigeon Toe. We each had an appetizer then split a salad and Santa had the free-to-hikers banana pudding and I had blueberry cobbler with ice cream. It may seem like all we do in town is eat- and that is true. Gotta fatten up before we go hike another 100 miles.Today was a good day to be in town, it really poured though it's nice and cool. The weather is supposed to be in the high 70's and 80's this coming week.Relaxing and taking care of our feet before we start hiking tomorrow and taking lots of showers and baths. It's weird, while hiking being dirty isn't a big deal but once in town, we really like to be clean.Excited for the next section. Spring has arrived and we are hoping for green leaves and pretty flowers as we walk.We both love seeing small town southern America as we come into the various towns. Very different from New England towns. People are more open and friendly to strangers, churches are involved in public schools, Bibles are in shelters, Bible verses are written on chalkboards in restaurants, people openly carry guns...It's turkey season so there's lots of talk about how many birds everyone has gotten and as we hike we often hear gunshots.

First we hiked past I-81 then through a green meadow. Then we walked through a stole and onto a pasture with cows in it. We had to walk carefully so we didn't step in cow poop and we had to walk around a cow that was in the middle of the trail contentedly eating grass and not paying any attention to us. We saw some calves and they ran away from us to their mama but she didn't pay any attention to us either.Then we climbed some mountains but there were switchbacks and the trail was nicely maintained. We stopped at the first shelter to have a drink break and saw a family out for a day hike. The 8 year old son gave me a bag of candy! First trail magic for awhile and he was an adorably energetic trail angel who asked some good questions. Easy walk to the second shelter for lunch. We then came to a road crossing and we discovered that we will be following the Blue Ridge Parkway for the next 100 miles. A truck from PA stopped and backed up so they could talk to us about the trail. It was fun chatting with a couple that's interested in our journey.We are at the third shelter for the night. Ghost is here in his tent and there are three flip-floppers that are hiking southbound. Santa helped Shoulder Wide hang his first bear bag. Seldom Seen and his wife Morning Dove are also sheltering with us tonight. It's a wee bit chilly tonight but I will be toasty warm in my sleeping bag.,"Daleville, VA

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529748,"Last night a wonderfully kind man made us very happy hikers. Vincent, Eric's uncle (the young man who gave us candy), surprised us with 2 pepperoni pizzas and chocolate cupcakes! We had all finished dinner, hung our bear bags and were getting ready to get in our sleeping bags when we saw three people coming down the blue blaze trail to the shelter. Then we heard a loud voice ask ""are Santa and Wonder here?"" It was Vincent and his parents bringing us trail magic. How unexpected and kind!Today was one of our hardest days in awhile. The morning started out cold, which is great for hiking and we had the usual go down to go up terrain. At lunch we saw Quick who we haven't seen in weeks. He was having knee problems so went home to Alexandria to have it checked out and then started hiking southbound. We also saw Klaus and his dog Nanook, who we haven't seen since Atkins. It was fun to sit and catch up on everyone's hikes. Klaus said if he hadn't worked so hard to get to America to do this hike, he would go home. I think it's harder than he thought it would be.After lunch we had a 4.9 uphill climb. It was hot and sunny and woefully lacking in switchbacks. Not too much fun. We thought about going a bit further since we got in at 4:45 but decided to call it a day.We have the shelter to ourselves. Klaus always tents with Nanook and Cabot and Hob (two young hikers from Maine) tent because they sleep in. We are hoping to get an early start because the forecast is calling for temps in the 80's.We sent a mail drop to the Three Springs Hostel and we should get there Tuesday. Unfortunately they are open Wednesday-Sunday. We tried to call because our book says you can get mail drops even when they are closed but we are struggling with cell service at the moment.

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530080,"Last night it was just the two of us in the shelter at nightfall when a day hiker that we had seen earlier stopped to chat. He is a member of the Natural Bridge AT Club that maintains this section of the trail. We told him that they do a really good job and complimented him on the privies in this section. He told us that a man who doesn't hike much anymore because he's getting old cuts the wood and puts the privies together at his house, then they take them apart and transport them into the woods and put them together again.After he moved on, Wizard showed up. We had met him at a previous shelter at lunch time. He was talking with an odd man who was using the shelter as a ""base camp"" to hike to waterfalls. He had 3 months of dehydrated meals and a huge Rubbermaid box of tobacco and rolling papers. Anyway, Wizard attempted a thru hike last year but made classic mistakes- too heavy of a pack and tried to keep up with kids half his age. While he was gone, his wife cleaned out his closet and gave most of his stuff away. He's out for a section hike and has ultra lite gear. He also has two bamboo hiking poles. One of them has a honed 3/8"" bit that he used to protect himself from a wild boar. Things can get interesting in shelters.Today's hike was fun. The leaves are coming out and the forest is looking alive. We passed many brooks and streams which have been absent from our landscape lately. It's really hot- in the 80's - so we stop and splash water on ourselves to cool off.We saw a sign for the Apple Orchard Trail. One of my kindergarteners misunderstood and thought we were hiking the Apple Orchard Trail so I had to stop and take a picture to send him. We saw Shoulder Wide slack packing southbound. We saw him on his second day when we had the trail magic pizza and didn't think we would see him again. He hiked his first four days with his wife, Slow As Molasses, Sam for short, and is now hiking 10-12 until he gets his hiker legs. Then we hiked past the FAA tower and under the guillotine (a rock formation that looks like it's going to fall on you). The AT parallels the James River for a mile and we crossed it on the longest footbridge on the trail.In for the night and Cabot and Hobbs are tenting and a section hiker is hammocking with his dog. It's finally starting to cool off. We took a quick sponge bath in the brook and Santa rinsed his shirt. A short 20 miles to town for a quick resupply tomorrow.

He also kept hearing an animal all night so he kept shining his light. We were in the shelter and it was annoying. It must have been really annoying in the tenting area.It was nice having the shelter to ourselves. We rubbed each other's feet, calves and shoulders, then snuggled in and went to sleep.Up and out early this morning. We had a big climb or two to start the day and it's sooo hot that we wanted to get started early.Beautiful terrain today with green forest and lots of wild flowers. The trees at the higher elevations haven't leafed yet so they don't provide much protection from the sun. The water sources in the middle of the hike weren't very good, but the southbounders we met were great about telling us where to get water. The last part of the day went past a river where Santa went swimming to the other side to get us some water from a freely flowing source. Then we walked along lots of streams where we stopped to cool off and soak our feet.We grabbed a shuttle into town with Cabot and Hobbes where we also found Brightside. Ordered Italian food which they delivered, walked down to the gas station for some resupply and a milkshake, took showers and now are watching HGTV.We had sent our resupply box to Three Springs Hostel. She's not open on Tuesdays but left our boxes out so we could get them with a note to get ourselves a cold soda. She was off getting baby goats today so we didn't get to meet Velma. Not only did we get our expected box with additional special treats from our girls, but the Marcotte family sent a box of candy and notes! Life is good!While we are sitting here, we are watching a pretty sweet thunder and lightning storm out our window. The heat was up in the high 80's here in VA today and our girls texted that they got 4 inches of snow in NH. Weather is weird.Cabot and Hobbes are a young, just out of college couple we have been hiking with this week. Cabot got her name because she started with a pound of Cabot cheese. Hobbes is named because he follows after Cabot trying to keep her wild ideas in check. They have met some interesting characters on the trail. I am glad we haven't met some of them. Some older hikers can be very condescending to younger hikers, especially females. Cabot and Hobbes have both worked in the AMC huts in the White Mountains and know about hiking.

It actually felt good because it was hot and humid today, but not as hot as yesterday. We got to the shelter just as it started to pour.

After dinner Santa ate the Mike and Ike's and I had a Kit Kat.We are sharing the shelter with an interesting gentleman hiking in jeans. I think he might be homeless. Gave us lots of tips on how to hike cheaply. We cooked two dinners and decided to give the second one to him. We might be a little hungry tomorrow but he was eating corn chips for dinner-he certainly needed it more than we did. Another interesting day on the AT.We are hoping to hike about 20 miles again tomorrow to set us up for a reasonable day on Friday into Waynesboro. The shelters are strangely spaced so it looks like we will be tenting. We have been lazy lately and haven't used our tent much so it will be nice to be cozy in it tomorrow.Brightside was born in Monson, Maine but moved in 5th grade. He now lives near Mount Shasta in California (Santa would like to retire near there in Weed). He's a really fast hiker who takes long lunch breaks and chats with other hikers.

It started with all our stuff being very damp from the mist including our sleeping bags. And nothing will wake you up faster than putting on a wet and cold sports bra, t-shirt and shorts! We hiked out into the mist and descended from 4000 feet to 1000 feet then back up to 4000 feet and down to 3000 feet. It was hard hiking with wet rocks and boulder fields. There were 8 picture icons on our map today (awesome views) and we didn't see one because of the constant cloud we were walking in all day.As we crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway and Santa went over to throw out our trash, a man pulled into the parking lot and got out of his car with his daughter. He wanted to talk to me about the hike and take our pictures. It was fun to chat with him and his second grade daughter.We stopped for a quick snack/energy break and then started walking again. I heard a crashing in the woods above me and stopped. A bear cub came racing down the mountain, across the trail and into the woods below us. I didn't get a picture- it happened too fast but we saw our first bear!So off we go walking up the trail and we hear thunder. So now the race is on. Can we beat the storm to our planned campsite? We did but just barely. We put up the tent and as Santa tied down the rain fly, I emptied our packs of everything we need for the night into our tent. We climb in and it starts storming. Rain is pouring down, thunder is booming and lightning is flashing.

I mentioned that we might be able to get a soda and Santa was very interested in checking it out. We hit the jackpot and got sandwiches, Doritos, and sodas! Then we happily hiked on. About 15 miles into the hike it got dark and ominous. Then the thunder started. We were heading for a wayside but still had 5 miles to go- there was no way we were going to outrun this one. It started to rain, then hail, and it was thundering and lightning. We made the mistake of not putting on our rain jackets. They wouldn't have kept us dry in the deluge but they would have kept us warmer and protected us a bit from the hail. We were very thankful for relatively flat and non-rocky terrain because we moved quickly. Santa slipped and went down but got right back up and hiked on. I gave up trying to keep my feet dry and just waded through the river (I mean trail). As we got to the blue blaze for the wayside, the rain dwindled to a drizzle and the sun came out. We changed into our camp clothes and laid our wet stuff out on the picnic table. Then we went in to eat. We started with an order of cheese fries then we each had fried chicken, mashed potatoes, coleslaw and a biscuit. Santa had Mountain Dew and I had three hot chocolates and a water. Then Santa had peanut butter pie for dessert and I had blackberry cobbler with blackberry ice cream. That was the amazing news.

We were under the upper sleeping platform which was awesome because there was a leak in the roof but the platform caught it so we didn't get wet. I didn't sleep that great- people snoring, mouse scurrying and lots of rain noise.When we woke up there was no mist! We were excited to start our day with sunshine. Off we went to hike about 3 miles to the Skyland Restaurant for breakfast. We passed their stables and the cabins then on into the restaurant. I had eggs, home fries, ham, biscuit and an order of pancakes with blackberry syrup. Santa had an omelet and bagel with cream cheese. Our food wasn't bad but it wasn't great. We have been happily eating at the waysides and this was more expensive but not as tasty.Then off we go to hike the 11 miles into town for our resupply and our mist is back. We met two ladies out for a day hike and had a great chat while we hiked. The lady I spoke with is an ELL teacher in Virginia so we talked about the differences in services and philosophy.

He was not excited about the rain in the weeks' forecast so he is going to do day hikes instead of a true section. He also doesn't like rocks so he won't like this part.Now we are done eating and socializing so we settle in to hike fast into town. There is an ominous black cloud overhead so we play our game ""can we beat the rain?"" Alas we lost this round and it rained the last few miles. But that's okay because we were off to town and a dry bed for the night. Then we worry that no one will pick us up for the 9 miles into town because our gear is soaked and we look like drowned rats. As we come into the trailhead parking lot we see a woman packing up her stuff after a hike. Santa goes over to chat and I tag along. She is happy to go out of her way to give us a ride! We chat about hiking the whole way in because she's getting ready to do a section with a friend. She is very much like me- loves to plan. She loves it so much that her trail name is Plan!So we are settled in town and it's sunny but we can see the clouds covering the mountains. We drop our stuff and walk to the outfitters for our resupply box and a box from a friend, Cassie, that we were expecting. We found those two boxes and a third! I love surprises. We leave the boxes (we will come back later) and head to Pizza Hut for lunch. Bellies full we go get our boxes and bring them back to our room. The girls sent our resupply plus extra goodies and most importantly a note. Love the notes! Then we open Cassie's box- Santa is happy about the bars (he's getting tired of Clif bars) and the Baby Ruths. I am excited for Kit Kats- chocolate with a satisfying crunch. Then we open the mystery box and it's Star Wars graham crackers! Loved the movies and I love graham crackers- thank you Tanya and KK this is two surprise boxes in a row. Though nothing can beat the Steeler duct tape.Then my amazing awesome husband goes to the laundromat and food store while I shower and then have a soak in the tub. Definitely have to shower first!We look at our book to be sure we have our next week/ week and a half planned carefully. Really exciting section for us! We will see Count and Lavender who we hosted as they hiked through NH, then two of Santa's fraternity brothers and then Santa's sister and hopefully one or both of our nieces. A little stressful to have to stick so closely to our schedule but really exciting to see friends and family.Then off to dinner at an Irish Pub and back to call the girls. We were able to talk to all three at once because Casey came home to watch the Penguins/Capitals game with her sisters. We shared an exciting decision we are contemplating with them and asked them to think about it until we talk to them next. Then they shared their exciting decision. Life can really get exciting! Talked with our sister-in-law Tricia and asked her to pass on some news to Santa's brother Kevin. We can't really talk about all this stuff yet. I mention it because ""home stuff"" can really mess with your head while hiking. Sometimes it is hard to ""stay in the moment"" on the trail when real life is occupying a large part of your brain. All good but still distracting.Off to sleep because we have lots of miles to hike and lots of friends and family to visit in the next week.Thank you for your encouraging comments on our blog and on Facebook! We really need them sometimes and appreciate them always!","Rock Spring Hut

Again!Jim, a trail angel, gave us and Dan, a section hiker, a ride back to the trail. The rain let up and it just drizzled on us. We both hiked in our rain jackets today because it's cold- low 50's.After 8.8 miles we stopped at our last wayside for lunch. And their milkshake machine is broken! I did not get a blackberry milkshake. Very disappointing. The only wayside that had milkshakes is The Meadows but that's where we got stuck in the hail and rainstorm and I wanted hot chocolate not a milkshake. We got sandwiches and I got soup while Santa indulged in fries and a hot pretzel. Very strange place- nowhere to sit except outside picnic tables and it was raining. The nice lady let us sit in the fireplace.Then we set out for the last 6 miles of a short day and it started to rain. So a wet last bit for the day.In to a shelter with 4 section hikers and 1 other thru hiker. There is 1 section hiker tenting because he's really unhappy with the rain and is in a bad mood. I get that but he gets to go home tomorrow so I don't know why he's complaining.","Luray, VA

No room so they cooked and set up their tents. No one was too excited about the weather. One group of section hikers was cutting short their hike and another group was in discussion about shortening their hike.I had a great conversation about teaching kindergarten with a retired teacher. He likened it to putting ten puppies on a round table and being asked to keep them all safely on the table. Not how I would describe my job....Woke up this morning to wet cold clothes and a wet cold day. We had planned on hiking 18 miles to the Jim and Molly Denton shelter but as we went along in the 40 degree rainy windy weather, we decided to go into town after 14 miles and get dry. It means a longer day tomorrow or Sunday but we felt it was a good choice for us. As we came into town we noticed that other hikers were making the same choice.We had a great ride in from the Yellow Cab driven by Spike. He chatted with us about local areas and politics and was really informative.Got a hotel room and hot shower then off to eat- Spike wasn't available but the cab company gave us a ride to .....Pizza Hut. It seems to be our town favorite. When it was time to go back to the hotel, Spike gave us a ride.As usual I got a hot bath while Santa did laundry. A hiker friend is going to come into town tomorrow and we want to hang out with him but we need to hike out so we can meet Count and Lavender on Sunday and Kelly's fraternity brothers on Monday.

And yes, it was raining.Off to breakfast and we ran into Dan, a section hiker, that we had met when we shared a shuttle out of Luray. He had decided to cut his section short and go home to Orlando. I think it might have rained on him for the three weeks he was out.We took the yellow cab back to the trail and started hiking. It only rained on us for about 45 minutes then it was my perfect hiking weather- cool and overcast. Today was a great day of hiking. The terrain was sweet and the weather cooperated. The only negative was how wet the trail was. We waded through streams, small ponds and very muddy trail.We stopped at the Molly and Jim Denton Shelter for a snack break (I ate the caprese salad that I had packed out) and to check out this very cool shelter. It had a covered picnic table for cooking and eating, a nice privy with toilet paper, a solar shower (we didn't use it) and a horseshoe pit. We met 6 guys out for a section hike and we leap-frogged with them all morning and part of the afternoon. Then off to the next shelter where we had lunch. Santa and I shared one of our dinners and the brownies that we packed out from town. We met a couple who met each other when he was thru hiking and she was section hiking. They are now engaged.Then off to the next shelter for an early dinner. We were warned that it wasn't a great shelter but it was a domed shelter and we wanted to see it. Because of all the rain, it was surrounded by water. There was water running under the picnic table, in front of the shelter and even under the privy. We ate a quick dinner and hiked on.The AT goes through the Sky Meadows State Park. We met a large group of day hikers who were there for an astronomy lecture. They were excited to see us and when we confirmed we were thru hikers they clapped so I bowed. They started giving us stuff out of their packs- we got an apple, an orange, two packs of snacks and they took our garbage. We stayed and chatted for a bit. Then we hiked on and met three young adults out for a hike. The young woman, Zoe, is interested in a thru hike. We chatted a bit about her pack and we are going to communicate via our blog about what I am carrying in my pack. Her pack is way too heavy.Then off we go again, wading through streams that used to be the trail. We finally reached our destination for the night and there are three section hikers in the shelter and two hikers tenting.We start the ""roller coaster"" tomorrow.

After the section hikers were asleep and we were almost asleep, another hiker came in with his head lamp blazing. He sheltered in the ""top bunk"" of the shelter.We were not the first people up! One of the section hikers was up at 5:30. Not excited about waking up but it was good because we wanted to make big miles early. Not a lot of miles but 13 of them were the ""roller coaster"" type: a series of steep ups and downs with rocks, roots and lots of water thrown in for fun.The first part was easy but as the day went on they got harder.It was Mothers Day and sunny (!) so a lot of families were out hiking in parts of the trail. It was great to see people on the trail but it was hard to find the privacy to pee.We hiked to Bears Den Hostel to pick up our resupply box and get some soda and lunch to power the end of our day. We met a family hiking and they were excited to meet thru hikers. As teachers we are always happy to answer questions and share our experiences. We hope that someone in this family thru hikes one day.We had our usual pepperoni, cheese and crackers for lunch. And a quart size bag of brownies (thanks Kristin!) Yes, I ate 8 brownies on my own after lunch. The girls always send treats in our box and this time they included an amazing card and thoughtful notes. Happy tears moment for this mom! Today is always hard because I miss my mom so much. She was an incredibly strong, supportive and loving person. And I miss her every day.We hiked on and Lavender and Mark hiked up the trail to meet us. It's amazing to be hosted by former thru hikers. They had cold sodas and juice, fruit and brownies in the truck. Then we had showers and dinner (salad, carrots with butter, chicken, loaded baked potatoes, and a toffee cake with caramel sauce). Yum!The Lavender took me to Walgreens and then I had my first Epsom Salts bath. Helped some soreness go away Great night's sleep in a comfy, clean and warm bed after lots of trail talk. It was a perfect night.We hosted Lavender and Count at our house in NH when they thru hiked last year. Lavender got her name because she was promised a lavender Epsom salt bath and talked about it quite a bit. It didn't actually happen, but she got a trail name. Count would count as he climbed difficult mountains to distract himself. So, the name Count fit him. They are back in the US after a long career in England. Count would like to hike the PCT but Lavender doesn't seem as excited. It will be interesting to hear how that all plays out.

We were excited because Santa's fraternity brothers were going to meet us for dinner. I really wanted to get a shower before we saw them so we were quick this morning. Nice walk into Harper's Ferry and we went to the ATC to get our pictures taken. We were hikers 127 and 128 to register. We saw Cabot and Hobbes there and Quick. Then Brightside came in with his wife so we got to meet her. They told us about the B&B they were staying at and we quickly got ourselves a room there also. Karen loaned me shampoo, conditioner and a blow dryer so I could look presentable. We contacted Santa's friends, Frank and Lance, and they came to get us and we walked around historic Harpers Ferry. I was really glad that Lance's wife came. It was awesome to chat with a female over the age of 24. And she likes funnel cake! The funnel cake place was closed but we were able to find funnel cake fries- very delicious.It was hard to find a place for dinner. A lot of places were closed. We ended up at a somewhat snooty place but everyone enjoyed the company and the food. Mark, another fraternity brother, came by with his daughter on their way from college to home. It was a wonderful evening and Santa was so happy to see these guys. I am amazed that they came so far to see us. Especially Frank- he drove from Mass to WV to see us.

He's going to fill us in on all the details when we next meet on the trail.Breakfast wasn't served at the B&B until 8:30 and we couldn't leave that late so we went to a cafe down the street. I had the hiker breakfast- 2 eggs, toast, home fries, bacon and 2 blueberry pancakes. Yum! Santa had an omelette, home fries and a bagel.Then we had to start walking. Rumor had it that this was an easy walk and it was! We walked about 3 hours, crossed a footbridge above SR11 and Santa noticed lots of businesses and suggested that we might want to take a break and eat. So we walked down to the road and walked past two traffic lights and found a diner. Second breakfast time- I had a blueberry waffle with whipped cream and Santa had a breakfast sandwich and home fries. Then we walked some more really sweet trail. It followed pasture land but was inside the forest so it wasn't too sunny and hot. We walked to the next shelter and stopped for our pepperoni, cheese and cracker lunch. We chatted with a trail runner who was taking a group of Boy Scouts on a 50 mile section hike and he asked lots of questions about the terrain we had just finished walking. Then we walked some more across meadows and cow pastures. You had to watch where you stepped!The trail then became the trail we know. There were more changes in elevation and our AWOL book warned us that the next section was really rocky. It was more rocky than what we have seen lately but it wasn't as rocky as what we have already done. But we have also been warned about the rattlesnakes so Santa is leading.

We were happy to move on.Today we continued our new habit of eating our way up the trail. We walked 4 miles into Duncannon (the trail goes through the town) and stopped at a gas station for a second breakfast. Then we walked two more miles to where we were supposed to meet my aunt and uncle. We were early so Santa called them and they said they would be there in half an hour. It looked like rain so we went under the bridge near commuter parking to wait. Two thru hikers who are doing a flip flop hike came over to chat. We offered some advice on blisters and hot spots. I hope it helps because one of the guys was really suffering. Then Quick came by. We thought he was a day or two ahead of us but he slipped on a water bottle someone left on the trail and banged up his knee and ankle so rested it yesterday. Always good to see people we know and spend time chatting and catching up.Then Aunt Jean and Uncle Dick arrived to take us to lunch. It was wonderful to see them and catch up on family news. It was a little sad too because Dick looks a lot like my dad now and it made me really miss him. Jean brought a photo album of some trips they took with my parents and it was fun to look at them and remember how much fun my parents had together and with their families.After lunch it was time to hike again. We stopped at a beautiful shelter to cook dinner and visit with some people. We all had a story to share about the woman we met last night. We saw Bucky, a thru hiker, that we have met before, the two guys that are starting their flip flop hike and Frenchie, a flip flop thru hiker from Quebec. They were all staying but we wanted to get 5 more miles in to make the next two days easier.Off we went and the first four miles went quickly but then I tripped and aggravated my sore leg. I was not a happy hiker. And we kept hearing explosive type sounds and were speculating what they could be. I asked Santa why we keep walking towards the sound of gunfire or the sound of explosives. He didn't have a good answer.We got to the camp site and met a flip flop hiker already set up. It was fun to have someone new to chat with. He had texted his partner who lives nearby and the sounds we are hearing are from a weapons test site.

They are preparing us for the really rocky part coming up soon.We met a lot of flip flop hikers today. Some of the men are amazed that I can hike faster and farther than they can. But I have been hiking for 1181 miles and they just started. Most are curious and ask for our most important piece of advice to share. We both say start low (miles) and slow.The shelters are oddly spaced this stretch of trail. We tented last night and planned to tent tonight. But the camp site in our book was near I81 and in a state park where you can't camp. So we walked another mile and went into town (we would have had to walk another 9 miles and that wasn't happening). So dinner was two sandwiches, curly fries and an orange cream shake at Arby's. Santa had two sandwiches, loaded fries (his new town favorite) and a Mountain Dew. Then we went to dollar general for snacks for tomorrow's hike.Meeting all the new hikers made me think about perspective. At the beginning of our hike we purposely hiked 8-10 miles a day and if we were at a shelter or tent spot at 3 we stopped for the day. The other day we stopped at a shelter for a snack and chat at 3:30 and then hiked another 7 miles. We used to hike 1 1/2 miles an hour and now we routinely hike 2 1/2 miles an hour.A blog friend commented that other hikers she is following have met some unsavory people on the trail. Santa and I have been fortunate to have only met two people who have made us uncomfortable. When you think of how many new people we meet each day, that is such a low percentage. But we are careful and hike together and always stay close to each other.

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534117,"We were up at 6, ate breakfast in the hotel, and were back on the trail by 7:10. We are only doing 10 miles then going back into town to resupply and rest our feet. We have been in town quite a bit to eat and sleep but we have been going in after hiking 20 miles. This was a much needed rest day.Our bodies are doing pretty well except for our feet. We got new shoes, are rolling our feet on a tennis ball at breaks and we are rubbing each other's feet in an attempt to have them feel better. We are both nervous about the famed Pennsylvania rocks coming up and the effect they will have on our feet.We hiked with Heath Bar most of the ten miles today. He's our age and retired from Wuebec. When we met him two days ago we thought he was a flip flop hiker. But he started in Georgia and got hurt so took some time off which is why we just met him. He had started with a friend but his friend really missed his wife so he went home. Heath Bar is divorced and two of his kids are in college and one in boarding school so he felt it was a good year to hike. He's really fast and I wouldn't have been able to hike with him all day. It was nice to chat and hike today and to meet someone new. We discussed American and Canadian politics and the general trail gossip we all indulge in when we get together.Finished by 11 and came in to eat, pick up our package for our girls and an extra special box of brownie treats from our sister-in-law Martha. Thank you!I took a bath and nap while Santa set up the tent to dry and did laundry then we sorted out our plan for the week and our food and went to dollar general to get a few things.Ghost texted us that he was at a shelter 2 miles from town. I sent him a picture of the sign that said ""hot food, cold beer"" so he came into town for dinner. Brightside did a 27 mile day so he stayed at the shelter and ordered pizza (a special event at this one shelter).We are trying to get in consistent 20 mile days to meet family, friends and then my sister. Hard to judge what we can do because we don't know what the rocks will do to our hiking speed.Off to sleep because it's supposed to rain and we want to get an early start.","Swatara Gap

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534567,"Today was a day where we made a dumb novice hiker mistake. There was water at the shelter and we didn't want to carry it and then there was a spring and we didn't want to carry it and we were staying at a camp site near a spring so we just moved on. Unfortunately the spring was dry. So we sat down to figure out what to do- should we just camp and get water 10 miles down in the morning or walk 10 miles tonight to a water source or walk 4 miles into town. We quickly decided to go to town. There was no way we could make dinner without water and none of our snack foods sounded good without having a drink and we couldn't walk 10 more miles so off to town we went.We were communicating with Ghost and Brightside and they were in Hamburg and wanted us to come in and share a room with them. But we got to the town off the trail and it was 8:30 and getting dark so we found the Port Clinton Hotel, got a room and went down for dinner. The waitress was a bit surly about serving us so close to closing time but the good was plentiful and good.Our room was interesting. Santa took the side that was lower and I took the higher side just like when we tent on a slanted surface. There was a shared bathroom and it was a little gross. But we were inside, dry and ready to go hike tomorrow. Plus I got to watch Say Yes to the Prom Dress before I fell asleep.","Pine Grove, PA

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534569,"After the disaster that was Friday and sore aching feet, we were happy to have a short 14 mile day today. We hiked the morning on our own and chatted about stuff and then sat for our customary lunch of pepperoni, cheese and crackers with the added bonus of potato chips from dinner last night. And Quick came along and stopped to chat. He has a nasty head cold so took a short day yesterday to rest. We hiked with him a bit and caught up on hikers we all know. Then he went on ahead and we came across Bucky who we haven't seen since Holly Springs when he took a zero with his visiting girl friend. Bucky is a mechanical engineer in his late 20's who wasn't liking his job so quit to hike the trail. His family is from New Jersey so his dad came out to hike with him. It was a great day to hike with sprinkles instead of rain and not too many rocks. Santa walked with dad for a bit and chatted while I walked with Bucky and then we switched. It was nice to have someone new to talk to as we walked along the trail. Bucky's family left a cooler of drinks and a cooler of snacks as trail magic for hikers. So appreciated!We got to the shelter early and saw Quick there. It was early and he was going to hike on but we got to talking about the book he is writing in his head as he hiked and he ended up deciding to stay. Brightside came in and a new hiker named Fizz. It was awesome to see Brightside because we haven't seen him since Harpers Ferry though we communicate via text and Facebook. Bucky and his dad came in so now we have 6 bunks and 7 hikers. Santa and I decided to share.I didn't take my Aleve pm early enough and couldn't get to sleep before the snoring started. And I felt too confined between the wall and Santa and it was really dark and I had a panic attack. I woke Santa up and he thought I had to go to the bathroom so we went outside to pee and stood in the rain discussing how I was going to make it through the night. I listened to my iPod and read a book until I fell asleep. It was not a fun night and I told Santa that I wanted to be done hiking and go home. We decided that I shouldn't make any decisions until I felt more rested. So I am thinking and trying not to make any rash decisions.","Port Clinton, PA

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534576,"So the night wasn't good but I woke up determined to hike and enjoy it. I was nervous about the enjoying part because rumor has it that the rocks were about to get nasty. We were the first ones up but didn't get moving until someone else woke up but we were still packed up and on the trail at 6:30. Brightside soon passed us and we were wondering if Quick went into town with Bucky and his dad for breakfast because Quick usually passes us...quickly. But Quick decided to stay and sweep out the shelter.The rocks from the Eckville shelter to the Allentown Shelter were as awful as rumored and they were wet because it was raining. I fell 4 times but mostly just my pride was hurt with some minor bumps and scrapes. It's really frustrating because I am usually good on rocks but not today.After the Allentown Shelter it was beautiful trail again and we did 12 miles by 12pm.We were meeting Santa's Uncle Woody and Aunt Ginger's friends, Jim and Nancy who we had met in Oregon this summer. They live 20 minutes from the trail and generously offered to host us. They picked us up at the road crossing and we went to Pizza Hut for lunch then back to their house for showers and laundry. Their daughter Shari came over with her three boys and we went to cabelas to look for new shoes for me. I have only had this pair for 12 days but they are falling apart and contributing to my foot pain. They didn't have a great selection but I needed new shoes so I bought a pair. I hope they work out. While in Cabelas we saw Cabot and Hobbes. They are a day or two behind us so they should catch up when we visit with my sister this week.Back to the house where we had T-bone steaks, baked potatoes, green beans, salad and apple pie. Then off to Wegmans for a quick resupply.We will hit the trail early tomorrow because the rocks are supposed to be bad and they slow us down. Lately we could reliably do 20 plus miles a day but the rocks can make that questionable. The important thing is to do them safely even if it does slow us down. We are all aware and talk about how one fall can end your hike.","Eckville Shelter

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534749,"Wonderful night sleep in a comfy bed, delicious breakfast of scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon, toasted bagel with butter and a banana then Nancy drove us back to the trail on her way to a golf outing.Today was a tough day with lots of rocks, little water and high temps (in the 80's).The climb out of Lehigh Gap was scary. I am a crier and I cry a lot for different reasons but today was only the second time I have cried because I was scared. It was insane climbing that mountain of rock. It sprinkled and thundered but we didn't get a real rain or storm. If I had known what the climb was beforehand, I am not sure I would have done it.My new shoes are good so far. Nancy called Merrell and they are going to send me new shoes to replace the ones that fell apart after 12 days. The kid at Cabellas wasn't sure they would because I am a thru hiker but 12 days is a little soon for $140 shoes to break down.We are happily in our tent at a stealth site tonight. We ate our hot meal at lunch time at a shelter and filled up with water because water is scarce in this section. So dinner was easy- pepperoni, cheese and crackers. There are two people hanging in their hammocks at this spot.We met a German girl named Moonshine today. She is a flip flop hiker who started in Harpers Ferry. She has heavy leather boots and is really suffering from blisters. She is planning to get trail shoes soon. Moonshine got her name because she tried her first moonshine on the trail- a cherry/orange blend. She's a cheerful hiker and whistles as she walks.","Andreas, PA

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534816,"The hikers last night set up their hammocks across the trail to the campsites which was annoying. We found a good spot but tripped over their rain fly lines on our way through. And they slept in this morning so it was hard to be quiet as we were bushwacking around their inconvenient set up.The hike this morning was great! Nice trail and we made great time. We did the first 14 miles before noon so when we went through Wind Gap we decided to go into town for lunch. Our plan was to go to the sports bar a mile from the trail for a burger and soda but of course it wasn't open yet. But a nice lady picked us up within 5 minutes of our hitch to town and brought us to Burger King. This was our first visit to BK or a Macs since we started the trail. A Whopper with cheese, fries, multiple sodas and a chicken sandwich later I was done eating and we sat around and rested.Then we went out to the road to hitch back to the trail, BK was about 2 miles from the trail, and the third car that passed us stopped and gave us a ride.The afternoon started out great and then we hit some long stretches of rocks. We did fine on the really tricky and somewhat scary sections and I fell on the stupid rocky trail part. Fell right on my knee. For a minute I thought I broke my knee cap it hurt so bad but I can walk (did 5 more miles) but it's bruised and swollen and it hurts. So frustrating to do this again. I had 2 falls before PA and now I seem to fall everyday. It's probably because I think about stuff as I walk and should pay more attention to my footing. But walking 10-12 hours a day only thinking about foot placement gets boring.When we got to the shelter it was full but we have a nice tent site. Claire and Rob, the Berenstein Bears, are here and we haven't seen them since Harpers Ferry. It was nice to catch up with them and on the news of other thru hikers. We had a chuckle about a mutual friend, Ghost, who loves town food as much as we do. We haven't seen a lot of the hikers that started in Georgia in awhile so it was a nice change. We first met the BB the night before Front Royal when we went into town the next day because of the rain and 40 degree temps. They are a brother and sister pair from Weston, MA which isn't far from where we live. They are fast so we probably won't see them again but they are nice kids and we enjoy chatting with them.Only 17 miles to meet my sister and have our first zero since Harper's Ferry!

Desolation recommended a bakery. As we passed by there was a sign advertising a hot dog and a piece of pie for 2.95. As tempting as that was we went to the diner and saw Brightside and Ghost! And met QB. I had an amazing breakfast of very berry pancakes: amix of strawberries, raspberries and blueberries. And the waitress brought me a whole can of whipped cream. So after eating and visiting we headed out for the last 10 miles.Nice walk on ""tourist trail"" for a bit then it got rocky around Sunfish Pond. Lots of day hikers out and about and they look and smell so clean. We hiked up to the summit and the view was beautiful but also open and sunny and really hot.We got to the end of the trail and Bucky's family had left trail magic again We met up with my sister and she brought brownies, cookies, devil dogs, cherry tomatoes, blueberries and strawberries and sodas!

The waffle machine wasn't working correctly and the waffles were gooey inside.Then off to the outfitter to find me new pants (I need a smaller size) and Brightside needs new shoes. We struck out at the outfitter but found shoes at the running store. I will get pants next weekend when we are home.We all went to the Captain America: Civil War movie. Ghost smuggled in pats of butter for my popcorn- one of the things he's learned about is I like real butter on my popcorn. But I prefer it melted. It was a good movie but I missed having my girls who can explain parts that I don't quite get. Brightside and Ghost were impressed that we knew to stay after the credits for a small extra bit.Cabot and Hobbes hiked in and Ghost's sister, Joan, flew in so we all went to Texas Roadhouse for dinner. Joan treated us all to dinner- so kind!Everyone is 10 miles behind us and hiking low miles for a bit.

Up early to pack up and go get breakfast with Santa and my sister at Perkins and Ghost joined us. Right after we ordered, Brightside, Cabot and Hobbes came in and grabbed an adjacent table. Linda couldn't finish her breakfast so we passed it over to them and it was gobbled up. Joan, Ghost's sister, is not a morning person so the plan was to have a second breakfast at the hotel with her. We couldn't do that because we had miles to hike today. Santa drove us back to the Mohican Outdoor Center and we said goodbye to Linda and headed off. It was a quick goodbye because I wanted to jump in her air conditioned car and go home with her.Off we went. The rocks and terrain were reasonable today but it was sooo hot. We were ridge walking a lot so had no tree cover from the sun and the temps were in the high 80's. Santa was drenched, I was drenched- there wasn't a dry spot on us.We came to a road crossing at 5:30 and went .25 to a tavern for air conditioning, cold sodas and Santa had a pizza and pretzel and I had a cheeseburger. The kind bar tender filled our water bottles with cold water.Then off we went for the last three miles of the day. It was still hot and the bugs were awful. We got to the shelter, found a great tent spot and got our tent up quickly. Santa put our food in the bear box while I inflated our mattresses and got our tent all ready for a good nights sleep. Santa walked down to the stream to rinse off but I don't want to walk another .2 and deal with the bugs so I will just be sweaty and gross.Today the thing that was driving us both crazy were the inch worms and gypsy moth caterpillars. They would fall on us and get caught in our hair and all over our clothes. It was really disgusting.We didn't see many people today and we didn't hang out and chat with the people at the shelter because we are tired and grumpy and the bugs are bad.Santa did meet someone at the shelter on his way to clean up.

I fell asleep despite the commotion but Santa said they were loud until 10. He was not a happy Santa.Up at 6 and on the trail at 6:30. Today was going to be an easy 18 mile day with some treats thrown in. The terrain was rocky and there were some ups and downs but we spent more time under tree cover so it didn't feel as hot as yesterday.At 12 we had covered 12 miles and went to the ranger station at High Point State Park where we could get cold water for our water bottles, use a flush toilet and wash our hands with warm running water and bonus! They give a cold Pepsi to thru hikers! We were chatting with a bike rider at the ranger station. He works on the NJ/NY border and told us to stop at his business to get water and use the bathroom. Really nice guy and his name is.....Kelly!Then off to the next treat. A 1.1 mile hike then .3 to a beach! We went swimming in our hiking clothes and got ourselves and our clothes a little less stinky! The water was cold but felt amazing. Then even better there was a concession stand! I had an ice cream sandwich, two hot dogs, French fries, a coke and an Italian ice.Unfortunately we still had 6 miles to hike but they weren't bad. A little rocky but mostly swampy which didn't help the bug situation.We are at the Murray Property tonight. Mr. Murray is a trail angel who lets hikers camp on his property. There is an outdoor shower, a well with cold water and a building to hang out. It's rustic but a lot of fun.

It cooled off nicely and with the rain fly off the tent was nice and cool.We were up and on our way at 6:30, our usual time, today and eager to sample the town food on our agenda and an opportunity to swim again.We walked two miles and then crossed a road and took a detour for bagel, egg, cheese and ham sandwiches. I had one with a bottle of juice and Santa had two sandwiches with two Mountain Dews.Then off to hike more until lunch. We had everything today- woods, meadows, farm land, wildlife refuge and bogs-lots of bogs. And bogs equal bugs. We both have lots of bug bites and we are pretty itchy.Lunch was at the end of a boardwalk through a swamp. It was easy walking but unprotected from the sun and very buggy. But lunch was close by and delicious! I started with watermelon, a barbecue chicken wrap, a soda and finished with an Italian ice. Santa started with grapes, two barbecue chicken wraps and two sodas plus he finished mine. I got two apple cider donuts to go.The hike after lunch wasn't fun. It was steep and rocky plus hot and buggy. We stopped at a stream to soak our feet and take a bandana bath. It felt so good but once we started hiking we were sweaty again.We are the only ones at the shelter area at the moment but we expect three more people. We had lunch with them and their plan was to come here. We are tenting behind the shelter. It's too buggy to stay in the shelter. NJ isn't very good about putting shelters near water sources so we are being very careful about water again. Plus we both drank 4 liters today. Trying to be smart about the heat and not make myself sick again.Tomorrow is supposed to be a difficult section and it's supposed to rain tonight which will make the rocks slick. We have decided to do ten miles and then go into town-thunderstorms tomorrow afternoon are in the forecast.Trail magic! Time Warp's mom left a cooler of sodas on ice for thru hikers. Helped Santa power through the last climb. I am not finding soda thirst quenching so I passed.We met Has No Horse again. We had met him at Delaware Water Gap. He had taken a bad fall and I gave him some wipes to clean up. When we saw him today he had facial bruises and a black eye. We hiked together for awhile and chatted. He's 74 and hiked the PCT in three sections. He started the AT in March but has to get off the trail in 100 miles to go home for a wedding and work. He says he doesn't care about doing a thru hike, he just likes to hike. He gave himself his name from a book he read about a Native American from his home state of Oregon. There was a lady at the road crossing where we got lunch who offered us a place to stay tonight. We almost took her up on it but have miles to hike to get closer to New England by Friday to meet up with our girls. But Has No Horse doesn't have a schedule so he went home with her for a shower, dinner and a ride back to the trail in the morning.But I am perfectly happy sitting in our tent listening to worship music on Santa's iPod on this Sunday evening.","Murray Property

It was disappointing because Mantis was at the shelter and we haven't seen him since the half gallon challenge. He is a wicked fast hiker but had to take time off for his sister's graduation and then later for business school orientation at UVA. He kindly collected people's water containers and walked the .4 to get water. We had filled up at the stream but appreciated his offer. We had to put the rain fly on because the forecast was for rain. Our tent was like a sauna. We kept the flaps open until we started to drift off then closed them. Good thing we did because it poured most of the night. We stayed dry and it's relaxing to listen to the rain on the tent.When we woke up it was still raining so we rolled over and went back to sleep. The rain tapered to sprinkles so Santa went to get our food bags and we ate breakfast in our tent while we waited for the rain to stop. It stopped and we packed up then took down the wet tent, shook it off, packed it up and headed out.We were warned by Large that this section was tough and it was. It was very much like hiking in NH. The rocks were wet and slippery and the mosquitoes were rabid. It's hard to swat mosquitoes when you are using both hands to pull yourself up a rock face. We met a flip flop hiker named Cookie and she was struggling. She had fallen twice and wasn't having a very good morning. She got her name because she went to culinary school and had dehydrated all her meals. We also met a man who was hiking to raise awareness for veterans with PTSD. At the top of the highest point in the AT in NY there was an American flag and we took a selfie. We were both wearing the hat and headband that Santa's sister, Colleen, gave us. They are decorated with American flags and she asked us to wear them on Memorial Day in memory of her husband who was killed in a Navy plane crash.We walked to a road crossing and up to a dairy farm ice cream store. We both got a large raspberry sorbet in a waffle cone. Santa got a soda and I got a water. Then we called Anton's for a ride to the motel. The room wasn't quite ready but we could drop off our packs and walk down for lunch. We are at Murphy's Pub- tasty nachos, Santa had an everything burger and I had a roast beef wrap. Then back to the motel for a nap and shower.We walked back into town for dinner and the local pizzeria was overwhelmed and it took over an hour to get our salad and pizza. We also got subs for lunch tomorrow. I walked to Cumberland Farms for cereal, milk, and Doritos.Back to the motel to grab our clean clothes (they were really stinky from sweating the last few days and the swim in the lake).

Most hikers carry most of their pack weight in their legs but when Santa fastens his hip belt tightly it hurts, so he carries most of his pack right on his shoulders.The hike today should have been easier than it felt. There were lots of ups and downs but they weren't horrid, but both of us were feeling sluggish all day. We were very grateful that Cookie gave us her 100 percent DEET bug repellent. I felt like we were back in Jersey with all the mosquitoes flying around!Water is very scarce in this section and what water there is isn't very good. Trail Angels left water at two road crossings (one had chairs so we could sit and relax) and someone else left a cooler with drinks and snacks! Then we met a couple day hiking and they gave us apple pieces and pretzels. They offered us oranges too but we had subs and Doritos already for lunch. It's awesome how people support and encourage us and they don't even know us. We hiked to the beach, where we weren't allowed to swim, and called Anton's to come get us. While we waited we wandered over to the vending machines and got cold drinks and ice cream. When Anton came to get us he had the cutest puppy in the car- so ugly he was adorable. Even more importantly he had our resupply box and a package from Santa's colleagues. We got a box of devil dogs, candy bars, protein bars and 2 Gatorades. Plus they wrote us notes. Very kind and very sweet. Made our night!We were going to go back to Murphy's Pub, where we got lunch yesterday, but on the way I asked a lady hanging out in her backyard where we should go. She said Murphy's or Emerald Point Restaurant and to get the prime rib sandwich. So that's where we went and what we ordered and it was fabulous as were the fries and salad that came with it.We wandered back to our room and called home to wish our baby girl a very happy 21st birthday.

But off we went back to the trail and I got to cuddle with the adorable puppy again.Today's hike was cooler- temps in the 80's and much less buggy. We came to a shelter that was made of stone and built into a huge rock. Cool looking but dark and uncomfortable looking.As we were hiking along we met a young hiker who got on the trail in Carlisle, PA. His name is Warrior and he's going to hike until he runs out of money, his morale sinks or he runs out of time. He was camping with his brother last night, he is not hiking the trail, and they were visited by a bear. Warrior had a knife and his brother had a hatchet and they scared the bear off. He was really excited to see us because we were the first hikers he had seen and he really wanted to tell his story.We stopped for our pepperoni, cheese and cracker lunch and QB came by. She took a zero at a shelter so ended up behind us but quickly passed us by. We hiked up Bear Mountain after lunch. It was a challenging but fun hike. The trail club put a lot of effort into making it a reasonable hike. At the top we found vending machines! Santa had 3 Cokes and I had a can of lemonade and a bottle of cold water.After the climb we went down to the zoo and the lowest point on the AT. The zoo is small and old and the animals don't look too happy.Then we crossed Route 9 and went across the Bear Mountain Bridge. And up the Camp Smith Trail. It wasn't long but it was steep and not switch backed. After we got to the top we walked through gorgeous mountain laurel tunnels. They are one of my favorite flowers and they have been in bloom all over the trail.We had to cross Route 9 again and there was the Appalachian Deli. We stopped for dinner and had huge sandwiches and cold drinks and packed out some Cheetos.Then .6 to the Graymoor Spiritual Center. The Franciscan monks allow hikers to tent in their ball field. They also provide port-a-potties and a shower. And you can order pizza to be delivered.

I told him I was just getting braver.Last night it was amazing to hear the bells from the monastery play. It was very soothing as we drifted off to sleep.Today's hike wasn't difficult- the elevation gain and loss was reasonable and it wasn't too rocky but we both felt tired. Chatting with other thru hikers tonight it seems most of us are feeling the same way. The heat is taking its toll on all of us. The heat wave will break, hopefully, with the rain that's coming in tonight.We stopped for lunch and to get potable water at a pump building. It's been great having water multiple days that didn't have to be treated. While we were eating lunch we saw a group of 5th graders with their teachers. They are from the Bronx and got a grant for outdoor education. The group camped last night and were hiking today. A first for all the kids. One of the teachers had thru hiked in 2009. She reassures me that my feet will recover- it may just take a long time.The rest of the day was a nice walk through old growth forests and dome flat rock walking above tree line but it wasn't unbearably hot so it was nice. There is an American flag painted on one of the rocks from 9/11.We got to the RPH shelter and found Sorority Steve, Has No Horse, QB and three other thru hikers (I can't remember their names). We ordered 2 spaghetti and meatball dinners with salads from the pizza place that delivers to this shelter. I couldn't finish mine but one of the young thru hikers took care of it for me. I am packing out the salad for lunch tomorrow. QB thinks a reason I could be so tired is that I am not eating enough. But it's hard to eat when it's so hot and you are so tired. But Santa asked me to try harder, so I will.Santa had a tough day and he never does. His feet are really hurting and he's tired. I think our first double zero will be good for both of us. We just have to hike 20 miles in the rain tomorrow to where our girls will pick us up. Hopefully walking in the rain will help with the hiker stench!We had met QB at Delaware Water Gap when she was eating breakfast with Brightside, Quick and Ghost . We next met her briefly in Stroudsburg and saw her again yesterday near the zoo. She's at the shelter tonight waiting for her boyfriend to pick her up for a weekend away from the trail. She had 44 more miles to hike to finish the AT and then she's going out to Washington to finish her PCT hike. She's a very interesting young woman with fascinating stories and encouraging words for other thru hikers.It's been weird not being with Ghost, Brightside, Cabot and Hobbes. I hope we all can get back in sync when we get back to the trail. We also miss Cocoa Ken a lot. He made a good decision to rest and slow down so he could continue hiking. And his girlfriend has joined him and they are having fun hiking together.Off to sleep because we are starting our day super early (for us) so we can see our girls!","Graymoor Spiritual Center

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536608,Last night the shelter was full and there were many tents up in the field. The shelters are spaced very far apart because we are passing through state parks and they don't have shelters or many tenting opportunities. Many of the hikers ordered pizza to be delivered to the shelter. We all get excited for these good opportunities.We are in our tent early because we are getting up early to get the miles in to see our girls. Unfortunately I was chatting with other hikers and forgot to take my Advil pm. So I got to bed late for a 5am alarm. This is the first time we have set an alarm in the tent. Usually we just get up with the sun but 20 miles before we get picked up.The weather forecast was for rain at 6am so up we got at 5 and started to pack up and it started to pour! We quickly packed up the tent and the rest of our stuff. We were totally drenched before we even started hiking. But we will be dry tonight!Right after we started hiking the rain stopped. The rocks were wet but we were careful and no falls today.5 miles in we hiked .3 off the trail and went to a deli for breakfast sandwiches and juice (and a soda for Santa). A kind trail angel named Andrea gave us a lift back to the trail. Her friend is 6 weeks into his thru hike.We hiked on to the first shelter and stopped for a snack and drink break. We met a hiker named Doc and hiked about 3 miles with her to a road crossing where she was meeting a friend. Someone left cans of Mountain Dew and Pepsi for trail magic. Santa drank one and took one for the road. I took one to drink later for lunch.Then we hiked hard to the next shelter where we stopped in for lunch. We saw Haz No Horse and had a chance to wish him a good time at the wedding he is attending.3 more miles until we are done! It was rocky for a little bit and then we were hiking through overgrown meadow. Grasses were running against us and my arms and pant legs were covered with pollen. Then we were crossing a swamp on wooden bridges. We could hear frogs croaking and insects whirring and then a really loud train whistle. We are meeting the girls at the Appalachian Trail train station so we were excited to see and hear a train.We left the trail to cross a road and saw a garden center and texted the girls so they could find us. They brought Gatorades and bags of chips for hikers! While they took them to the trail head Santa and I were able to shower at the garden center. Such a generous gift for stinky hikers and the people who are going to be in the car with them.Off to dinner and then the hotel for an early night. I am hoping to see someone about a rash I have on my legs and an interesting blistery type thing on my left foot tomorrow.,"RPH Shelter

All three came with us to see the house, but it was too small for us. Kristin came along to look at two apartments; neither seemed right. We were parked on the side of the road looking at an ""apartment for rent"" sign when I saw my friend Mary running down the sidewalk. We looked like middle school girls hopping up and down, hugging and squealing.Lunch was fun with the girls and they were excited about their phones. I am interested to see what covers they buy... REI was semi-successful. I got new pants but Santa couldn't find shoes. He's hoping to try hiking in a pair of running shoes the girls brought him.Graduation was awesome. Santa's students were excited to see him and we saw friends that we haven't seen for a while. Chatted too long and were late to dinner. But the girls had ordered for us and the food came right after we sat down. Perfect timing! Back to the hotel to watch the Penguins game. I made it through the first period and then went to bed. They lost in overtime. Another fun but busy day tomorrow. This zero wasn't restful but I needed a family fix and this has been perfect.","NY-22

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537013,"We slept well Saturday night and slept until 7:30- the longest we have slept in a long time. We all got showers and went to McDonald's for breakfast and then to church. It was so nice to have our three daughters with us and to see our friends. Derek spoke about using our gifts to help others. He also gave a shout-out to Santa and other teachers in the sanctuary. His son struggled a bit junior and senior year and Santa helped him with math and with the college process. We spent a lot of time after the service talking to many people who are following our blog and praying for us.The girls went to Bertuccis to get us seats while we went to pick up a special little boy for lunch. He was surprised and happy to see us. He was also very well-behaved at lunch; maybe he's growing up. After we had lunch it was time to say goodbye to the girls. They were going to visit a friend who just had a baby and we were taking our little friend home then looking at another apartment. I didn't really like the two we looked at yesterday so we looked at a new complex. It's so new that we couldn't even see a model, but we committed to live there for a year. Fingers crossed we made the right choice.Then we went to a graduation party and to DQ. The party was for a daughter's friend. And the daughter had Santa for math and really enjoyed the experience. I had seen an ad for a funnel cake sundae so we had to go try it. It was so-so, but while we were there a car pulled in and Henry's family stopped to say hi to us. They follow our blog and send us candy. I had Henry last year in K and hope I get his sister Alice next year. Awesome family and not just because they send us sweets. Then we went to Kelly's brother's house for dinner and conversation. They were going to have a Sunday Sundae party but postponed to next week because it was pouring. This will be the first one we miss.We chatted for quite a bit, but Santa and I needed to go to bed. He fell right asleep and I worked on my school budget for next year. I made good progress and hope to get it done and mailed to our secretary by Friday. It's interesting trying to do it on the trail.Not looking forward to going back to the trail. Glad a friend is taking us back and not the girls. I will be more likely not to make a scene in front of a friend and her 13 year old daughter than if our kids brought us back.","NY-22

This is where we stayed the night before we flew to Georgia to start this trail. Martha made me scrambled eggs with cheese for my first breakfast. We headed back to our hometown to do some errands before meeting our ride back to the trail. We went to the grocery store for lunch supplies and snacks. We each picked up a sub to have for dinner tonight. Then we went to IHOP for breakfast. I love their blueberry crepes with whipped cream and Santa always gets an omelet with pancakes. Then we returned the rental car and our friends Tanya and KK met us there to drive us back to the trail. We had a good chat for the three hour drive. When we left, KK, who has a brain tumor, wasn't doing so well, but she looks and sounds great now! We weren't ready to leave them so we stopped for lunch and more time to talk. KK is having various treatments and is eating a raw vegan diet- makes me feel guilty when I order a calorie laden lunch.Tanya and KK dropped us at the garden center where the girls had picked us up and we crossed the street to get the trail magic bucket they had brought. All but one Gatorade was gone and all the snacks. They made some hikers happy. We gave the bucket to Tanya to take back to Mass for us. We reluctantly put our packs on, said quick goodbyes (I am not good at goodbyes) and headed out.It was about 2pm and the sun beat down on us as we crossed farmland and meadow. After 5 minutes Santa said he was ready for a break, but we kept trudging along and soon enough got into the woods where it was noticeably cooler. The trail was good to us today. There were little ups and downs, lots of flat parts, and it wasn't rocky or buggy. A good return after a 2 1/2 day break. Our legs weren't sure about this walking thing but we knocked off 10 miles by 6:30.The shelter was nice but the bugs are out so we walked .1 to the tenting area. There are 4 tents here and we don't know anybody. That's the problem with taking a break. Brightside is about 10 miles ahead of us, Ghost is going to try to get here tonight but it'll be a long day for him, and I don't know where Cabot and Hobbes are. Her mom came for a visit on Friday.We ate our subs (yum), washed up in the river and are hanging out in our tent. The forecast is for a clear night so we don't have the rain fly on the tent. Everyone else does but we get hot when it's on; the tent feels like a sauna.Oh, I forgot to mention that we are in CT. We will go back and forth between CT and NY for a few days but tonight we are in CT!","NY-22

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537279,"We were so pleased that Ghost hiked 29 miles to see us yesterday. He looked exhausted when he got in but we hugged and chatted for five minutes before he went to set up his tent and I went back into mine. We are going to hike together tomorrow so he will sleep in. We don't often start hiking before 6:30 and he's been known to start at 5. Ghost will be taking numerous zeros in this section to meet up with friends so we don't know when we will see him again.The morning started at 6:30 and I had a power breakfast of a devil dog and two coffee cakes. We hiked a mile and came to a road crossing and went .5 to a small market for juice and a biscuit, bacon, cheese and egg sandwich for me. Santa had a Mountain Dew and blueberry muffin and Ghost had two breakfast sandwiches, juice and a coke. Santa and I packed out subs, chips and a soda. Fortified with our second breakfast we started hiking again. The terrain wasn't too challenging, lots of small ups and downs, but they make your legs tired. We stopped at the first shelter to eat lunch and refill our water bottles. After lunch we had a bigger climb and then a steep walk down stone steps. All three of us were unhappy with this section. It made our knees hurt. Then a beautiful walk along the Housatonic River. We heard thunder in the distance and picked up our pace. We were playing our old game of ""Can We Beat the Rain?"" Half a mile from the campsite that has a pavilion it started to sprinkle. We stopped and put on our pack covers as it started to pour (we lost the game). The rain felt refreshing at first because we were hot and sweaty and then it felt cold. We were climbing a steep hill with lots of rocks so it wasn't safe to speed up. We got to the pavilion and met a woman who was out for the night while her husband was on a business trip. We hung our wet stuff and got out dinners to cook and eat. Ghost is going to sleep on the gravel floor of the open pavilion, it has a roof, and we are sleeping in our tent. Santa waited until it stopped raining to set it up. The birds are singing, crickets are chirping and it's time to get some sleep.We met a woman that we had seen in Georgia today. She has a trail name now. It is Puzzles because she has a hard time sleeping so she does crossword puzzles in her tent. She started hiking with a partner but he left the trail in Damascus because he was tired of walking. Puzzles went to Trail Days with Magic so it was good to hear how he's doing. It's strange how you see people you never thought you would see again.","Ten Mile River Shelter

Santa slept until 6:15 then we all got packed up and hit the trail.It is nice to hike with other people. You get to chat and learn more about them. I learned a lot about Ghost's family and friends today. We also discussed religion and politics. It made for an interesting walk.We found lots of water sources today and I am getting really good at using our new filter. The water tastes better and we can drink it quickly while it's still cold. We saw two waterfalls and water coming over a dam. We also experienced Connecticut's version of the roller coaster- a little tiring but nothing like Virginia's. We also went through Connecticut's ""lemon squeezer"". Much easier to navigate than New York's. We stopped for a quick lunch and it was very quick because it started to rain on us. Ghost put up his umbrella and Santa and I put on our rain coats. Today was chilly and when it started raining it felt cold. It only rained for about 2 hours and then the sun came out and umbrella and coats were put away.We came to a road crossing in Falls Village and walked a short distance to the town center. The Falls Village Inn restaurant didn't open until 5 but the incredibly helpful package store owner let us order take out from her phone and sit in her store where it was warm and not raining. She told us we could eat our food on the Inn's porch so we did. Ghost had a gyro and large sub, Santa had a grinder and French fries, and I had a grinder and garlic bread. Santa and I packed out 1/2 our grinders for breakfast tomorrow. The package store didn't have a bathroom so she gave me a key to the volunteer fire department and I used their bathroom. The town has a small brick building covered in ivy that has a shower head where you can shower. No curtain or wall and faces the road- none of us showered!After dinner we still had 4 miles to hike and it was so windy. We hiked fast and got to the .5 mile trail to the shelter. We went .4 and then it started to go steeply down. We stopped and found flat spots to put up our tents. There are two section hikers here. Gypsy Toes has only 2 small sections left and she will have hiked the whole trail! She was full of information about upcoming sections. Ghost is getting up really early to hike into town to see some friends. We are hoping to all have dinner on Friday. Ghost is meeting a lot of people in this section and taking a lot of zeros.

We slept until 7 and when we emerged from our tent everyone was gone. Ghost got up before dawn to hike 25 miles to town to see good friends. It was a quieter hike today with just the two of us. But we also got to have some good conversation about what happens after this hike and what we want from life. Not always comfortable conversation but important.We hiked 4 miles and went into Salisbury, CT for breakfast. We had eaten the second halves of our grinders earlier but town food beckoned and off we went. Santa had a breakfast sandwich and 2 cokes. I had buttermilk pancakes, juice and water. Pricey food and not the best we have had but the waitress was friendly and filled our water bottles for us.Our hike today took us out of Connecticut and into Massachusetts! We also felt like we were finally in New England because we had some steep and rocky climbs. Up on the rocky ridge we could see beautiful forests and farmland far below. Today was sunny but chilly and very windy. We were very thankful that all the rocks were dry.When we stopped for a short break we met a man out for a section hike. He has thru hiked NOBO and SOBO. He is a retired navy seal and had a fifty pound pack. He likes to stay ""off the grid"" because he likes to make fires (CT doesn't allow campfires) and he had goodies with him. He only mentioned the vodka by name and I choose not to speculate as to what else he had. His trail name is Intimidator because he smacked a bear three times in the nose to get him to move. Sometimes we meet some interesting characters out here.We have set up our tent on a tent platform for the first time. Hope it doesn't blow off with us in it!Hoping for a good night's sleep and to get up early for the 8 mile walk into town and a hostel stay.

We think putting up our tent on the platform, which is required, let cold air up under the tent and so I was cold. So I am the one that slept in this morning! But we were up and out by 6:30 to do our 8 miles into town.The first part of the hike was rocky and steep. Not bad but the profile showed flat or down so I was annoyed. The last part was Santa's favorite type of forest. He really likes old growth pine forests. I like the soft pine needles underfoot and the smell, but don't really care for how dark these forests look.We got to Sheffield and walked to a garage to get a soda and call for a ride. We saw two hikers and chatted for a minute and then someone stopped to give them a ride. They were going to the same place we were and tenting in Jess' yard. Nice guys from Montreal, but a little hard to understand at times because of the accent.Brightside is here and we walked down to a cafe for lunch. Then I took a nap and Santa went to the post office, the bank and called his brother Kevin. When I got up, Jess took Brightside, Santa and I to the grocery store to resupply. And I walked over to the bakery and bought a blueberry crumble- delicious.We sorted out our stuff and then Ghost and his friend picked us up for dinner. We had lively conversation and got to meet his daughter and her wife. They are both educators so we had lots to talk about.Late night and we are the only ones hiking out tomorrow. Brightside is fighting a cold and Ghost is hanging one more day with his friend. It is unlikely we will see Ghost again on the trail because he's taking a bunch of zeroes to visit with friends and we have a schedule to keep so we will be done before we need to go back to work.

The two Canadian men (trail name Yellow Birds because they both wear yellow shirts and they fly) that were at Jess Treat's with us also shuttled to the trail but one forgot his poles so they had to go back and get them. It was a nice hike with some New England climbs and rocks to get us ready for New Hampshire but nothing too difficult. After about 3 miles the Yellow Birds passed us. They were hoping to do thirty miles today. A little disheartening since they have only been hiking 6 days and they blew us away!We saw them again when they got turned around and were hiking south. This section was very tricky and it took us a while to figure it out also but we didn't go south. When we saw a ridge runner and trail maintainer Santa explained about the confusing section and they listened and said they'd work on it.It started to rain about 4 miles into the hike and at 6 miles we came to a shelter so stopped to eat lunch. We had packed out grinders, cherries and chips so there was going to be a feast. Then it started to downpour and it was cold-in the low 50's. So we got out our sleeping pads and bags and laid down. I rested but Santa slept for about an hour and a half. We debated whether or not we were just going to stay-Santa for staying, me for moving on. The trail maintainers came in for lunch so we toughened up and moved on.We saw the Yellow Birds hiking south again. One of them fell on the wet rocks and hurt himself so they were going to a road crossing where Jess could pick them up.Today was a fun animal day. We saw a bunch of goats at a farm following along behind a farmer. It was a definite Pied Piper moment. Then we came to a beaver pond and saw a beaver swimming and slapping his tail.

We got to meet Endless this morning though. He started at Springer on April 17! He averages 30 miles a day and hopes to be done in 80 days. He thru hiked the PCT last year but missed part of Washington because of wild fires so he hopes to finish the AT quickly to go finish it. Endless is a firefighter and pools his vacation days and works extra shifts during the winter so his fellow firefighters cover his shifts while he's out hiking. Doubt we will ever see him again.Today's hike was pretty simple. We hiked up and down mountains all morning. We hiked an extra .5 each way to go check out the Upper Goose Pond Cabin. It's an enclosed cabin with a caretaker who makes blueberry pancakes in the morning. You can also swim and canoe on the pond. It's really cold and windy so we didn't swim or canoe. Just checked it out, met the caretaker, ate our lunch at the picnic table and moved on.We crossed the Mass Pike today and while I was taking Santa's picture I had a pity party for myself. I was tired of being wet and cold or hot and sweaty. I was tired of my feet, ankles and legs hurting. I was mostly tired thinking about hiking 10-12 hours a day for seven more weeks. Then I thought of how many people I could call to come rescue me. Fortunately I also thought that those people are also the ones who pray for us daily, think kind thoughts, send encouraging messages and sometimes even care packages. So instead of calling someone, I took the picture and started hiking up a mountain through the muck. It started sprinkling and I really hate getting wet at the end of the day. Thankfully it just sprinkled.Then we got to Route 20 and took a .1 detour to a hotel and bought 4 sodas. Two for right then and two to pack out for dinner.It felt like a long 7 miles to the shelter. We thought we might be the only ones there but then the two Canadian boys passed us. We got to the shelter and it's full of section hikers. So up goes the tent and it starts sprinkling again. I hope it doesn't rain tonight- wet tents are really heavy to carry.Had a really good dehydrated dinner and chat with a section hiking couple. They took 2 months off and are going to see how far they can get. They have their dog so are going to skip Moosilauke because of the rebar ladder and Katahdin because fogs aren't allowed in the park.Tomorrow is the cookie lady's house, lunch in Dalton and then hopefully a stay indoors at a church.

We immediately noticed that a hiker came in after we went to bed last night. He was very quiet because neither of us heard him. We were the first ones up today.The Cookie Lady was only three miles from our start but we got there at 7 so we didn't stop. Nice climbs today in old growth forest and then lots of boggy mucky walk (but it was mostly flat). We were thankful for the cold weather because there were very few mosquitoes.The trail went through the town of Dalton. We stopped for a delicious lunch of steak sandwiches.

Then off to the gas station to get Santa some snacks and a soda.Back to the woods to climb and then a walk along a beaver pond.

Up about 5:30 and on the trail by 6.We walked through town, a corn field (where we saw two deer), up a meadow and then back into the woods. Our book showed a long gradual climb to the peak of Mount Greylock and that's what it was. Very muddy from last night's rain but there were a lot of log boards. It was also cold and we both wore out rain jackets for warmth most of the morning. It's weird to see your breath on the 14th of June but it also means very few mosquitoes which would have been nasty with all the water if it had been warm.We summitted Greylock and ate at Bascom Lodge. It was pricey but very good food. I had mixed berry pancakes and a juice. Santa had an egg sandwich with home fries and a soda. It was pleasantly warm at the top and sunny. We couldn't go in the memorial because it is undergoing renovations. We saw a woman who thru hiked in 1997 and chatted with her a bit.We have hiked Greylock numerous times and have section hiked from here to Hanover. So we talked about the different children that have hiked or been carried up this mountain and talked about our section hike.We saw a glider at the top of Williams Mountain. It was big and so silent.The descent was much steeper than the up and hurt our knees but it was a quick hike into Williamstown. We walked into town and talked about our section hike again. This had been our first day and we had made a wrong turn because we couldn't believe we walked through a town. There have been lots of road walks the last two days. No one wanted to give us a ride into town so we hopped on the bus. Went too far because we were clueless but had a nice ride past Williams College and met another couple who was hiking. We were both confused as to what they were doing but that's okay- we were able to answer some of their questions about the upcoming section,Got to our hotel and found a care package from a family at our church who have been following us. Thin mint cookies, packages of nuts, spray for our feet (feels good and smells even better) and an encouraging card. Thank you! And of course our resupply box from our girls.I am going to take a short break. I will fix our apartment situation, gain some weight, see a doctor about my feet and find a better attitude about finishing this hike. We talked a lot about this all day. I am blessed with an incredible husband that wants me to finish with him but not at the expense of my happiness. I am hoping to get our ""real life stuff"" taken care of so I can rejoin him soon. Our oldest daughter is going to come get me and help me apartment hunt. We will also visit with a special little boy. Then go home to NH where we hope to host Large and White Rabbit before I go meet Santa in Rutland where he is going to resupply. The plan is for me to start hiking again in Hanover where we ended our section hike. I am grateful that a friend's son and wife will host Santa at their house tomorrow and the friend will host him later in the week.

Not only for this thru hike but for any hike since we got married that we did not hike together. I learned a few things today. Hiking by myself I can stretch my stride and cover more miles with the same number of steps. That being said, I still run out of gas at about 15 miles. In addition, I bashed my toes on rocks and roots many more times than when hiking with Wonder.Now that I am in Vermont there are not many views, just lots of hiking in the canopy of the trees. The positive is that although the day was hot I was protected from the sun for most of the day. Met several section hikers earlier in the day and one thru hiker, Ghost Rider (as in the song form the Outlaws). Did not see anyone in the afternoon so it was especially lonely.Awesome trail magic at the end of the day. Got an ice cream sandwich and cold soda from a vet who seems to be bouncing along the trail and dishing out magic. We ran into him while hiking in Connecticut and had a brief talk with him then. Then I was picked up from the trail by Joe and Ren Carter to spend the night at their house. Got a shower, great dinner and company. What a great couple.I want to end with a question, or a 'wonder', if you would like. I am sure you have taken a walk at some point and passed that pile of animal poop that is covered with flies. My question is related to this. I picked a quiet, shady spot for lunch. Within a minute I was inundated with those flies. Does this mean that they thought I was a giant pile of poop?","Williamstown, MA

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538555,Today marked the third straight day of climbing to peaks over 3000 feet. The primary peak today was Glastenbury Mountain at about 3800 feet. On the map the climb looked quite difficult but for a change the climb was spread over many miles so it was not so bad. Also passed several small bogs/ponds. One had a pretty impressive beaver home.Saw no wildlife of note and only a couple people. I met a southbound section hiker called Mapquest and am camping with a northbound thru hiker known as the Spaniard. He is a 68 year old from Spain. He has been quite interesting to talk to. He has hiked the PCT and all seven of the European El Dorado's.My observation for the day is that there should be tons of blackberries in about a month based on all the plants that were blossoming or already starting berries. The hikers and the bears will have to fight over them.,"VT 9

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538709,"Today was a great day all around. First time over 4000 feet since VA. Ran into a nice young man and his German Shepard puppy at the base of Stratton Mountain. He gave me a nice cold apple to help power me up the mountian. As it turned out the climb was not especially rigorous. The temp was great so I did not sweat as much as usual going up Stratton. The views from the tower at the top were awesome. Could see two other ski mountains, I assume they were Okemo and Bromley.Talked to Wonder on the phone while sitting at the top of the tower. Learned she was coming to join me for the night in Manchester Center. That gave me added incentive to drive through the rest of the day. I finished by 3:30. I ran into a few weekend hikers and am seeing more Long Trail hikers but not thru hikers. Wonder arrived around 4 with cold drinks so all was well in my world.The one different part of the day was last night. It was my first night in our spacious tent without Wonder. In one aspect it was good because the tentsites were rocky but I only had to find a non-rocky place for one. It was strange getting up to to the bathroom in the middle of the night and not needing to worry about disturbing the person next to me. The bad part was there was a wild animal rustling around the tent for a while and I did not have Wonder to protect me.","Story Spring Shelter

Got a late start because I had a nice breakfast with Wonder at Bob's Diner. Pretty tired by the end of the day maybe because I have done a lot of 20 mile days in a row. A nice weather day on a Saturday means a lot of people on the trail in Vermont. Many day hikers, families, and people out for the weekend. I did not meet any new thru hikers. I did run into a group from Delaware Water Gap in PA. They were very interested in how their town rated as a trail town.At the end of the day I had another small world experience. I was resting at a dirt road crossing when nine US Forest Service Police cars and SUVs passed by. For Vermont it must have been the whole police force. A family came out of the woods at the same time. We got to talking and apparently all the vehicles were coming from a rainbow convention up the road. After talking for a while longer I found out the dad was an uncle of one of my former students. It never ceases to amaze me how interconnected we all are. Once again cell phone service was pretty poor for most of the day. There were no opportunities to slide into town for a bit, either. There were several swimming holes during today's hike but since there were so many families about I did not want to risk a naked Santa scene.","Manchester Center, VT

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539079,"Most notable for the day is that there is just under 500 miles to go! 
Started hiking at 6am and several small peaks to climb and descend before stopping for lunch. Took a half mile detour to eat at The Whistle Stop. I had remembered that it was a hiker friendly place from a section hike a couple years ago. Today they were my number one hiker friendly place by a lot. As I was setting my pack down outside, one of the waitresses came out to tell me that they had a charging station for my phone. I mentioned that I was going to change into my sleeping clothes because I was extremely sweaty. She pulled out a clothes drying rack and put it in the sun so I could dry out my sweaty clothes. I had a most excellent double cheeseburger for my Father's Day lunch. While I was eating a local gentleman came over to give me tips on where to stay for the next several nights after hiking. Overall just a great experience, well worth the extra half mile walk in and out. 
This afternoon was very hot so it was a bad day to lose my sweat bandana. Although my clothes had totally dried at lunch I still had to wring my shirt out twice in the afternoon. I met a nice woman waiting for her husband to finish his hike down Killington (what I will go up tomorrow am). She gave me some juice and a brownie which was quite nice. I saw very few people on the trail today and there are only weekenders and section hikers at the shelter tonight.
Looking forward to summiting Killington on what should be a clear morning. Will descend near Rutland where I will meet up with Wonder.
I have a two part wondering to finish off this post. First, wouldn't it be cool if all the spider webs that I have broken with my face and arms and legs could be magically weaved into a web shield from the bugs? Second, assuming the first could actually happen, how long before my protective web suit was so full of bugs it would look like the front grill of a truck?","Little Rock Pond Shelter

It was a beautiful clear morning so had wonderful 360 degree views of the area. Got there too early to visit the lodge, it did not open for another two hours. Hike was much better than a few years ago. Several sections have been redone so the climb and descent was easier. It got hot on the way down so the bugs were out in full force. I briefly saw two hikers, MacGyver and Ear. Other than that it was just me. It was kind of weird exploring a deserted ski mountain peak.

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539733,"We slept really well last night- I even slept through the thunder and lightning storm. Up early even though breakfast wasn't served until 7. We went downstairs to wait and they didn't even open the breakfast room until 7:30. Breakfast was worth waiting for though. Orange juice, omelette, bacon and toast for Santa. V-8 juice, hot chocolate, French toast and bacon for me. We ate and picked up our packs and walked down to the trail head. It was wonderful to be hiking again and doing our usual rituals of a kiss at every trail head. We chatted as we started our hike for the day.We were passed by Mantis who we haven't seen since the half way point. He got off for his sisters graduation and some other family stuff then he had to take a week off for UVA business school orientation. But he still hikes fast enough to do all that and pass us again. His dad is coming to hike The Whites with him so that will slow him down again.At Gifford Woods State Park we stopped at the office to use the bathroom and get a snack. We each had a Coke and Santa had an ice cream cookie sandwich.Then we walked up a mountain and down a mountain. I can keep up with Santa on the ups but he crushes me on the downs. Today the downs were especially difficult because my right knee was starting to hurt. We got to a road crossing and stopped for a snack and to chat with people at the parking lot. I turned my phone on and had a message from my doctor to call. When I spoke to her she said I have a tick borne illness and need to start on antibiotics. We had them with us but need to get more in Hanover because I have to take them for three weeks. I took one and almost immediately regretted it, the pill made me nauseous. We climbed some more and stopped at a shelter for lunch (cheese, pepperoni, crackers and Doritoes). There were two young men there that were section hiking for ten days. They had never camped before so they had lots of questions. Ten more miles to go so we moved on. I am not doing so well. My feet hurt, my knee hurts and I'm trying to keep my lunch down. I put my iPod on and listened to a book and then some music. It helped a bit but not enough. We decided to go 15 miles instead of 20 today. And we had a long talk about how this isn't going to work for me. Santa said I need to listen to my body and it was telling me that I am done. I knew that but I don't want to quit and I want to finish this adventure with him. But I am slowing him down and I can't walk downhill without wanting to cry. So lots of tears from me tonight. Santa is going to continue and I am going to see him every 3-4 days when he resupplies. He's already given me a list of things to do  get the bathrooms remodeled, have the heater installed on the pool, and figure out how to move DCF along so we can have a special little boy live with us sooner rather than later.

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539734,"Today was a tough day. I had organized a meeting point with the girls so they could get Wonder. The meeting point was nearly 8 miles from where we camped and mostly downhill. The downhills are what really hurt Wonder's knee so this leg was slow and painful. It was clear that there is most likely something more than overuse going on with the knee. In true thru hiker luck it rained for the last mile. For the last mile I carried her pack because she was in a lot of pain. I balanced it on my head and the top of my pack. It must have looked pretty funny. 
We got to the meeting point just about on time but the girls were not there. As it turns out we were not actually at the right meeting spot which was all my fault. Courtney was at the right spot and was hiking up to meet us. She never would have found us because we were on a different part of the trail. Wonder and I decided to hitch to the store that I told the girls we might go to next. Lots of cars passed us but most people do not want to pick up two soaking wet hikers. Eventually a young man excitedly picked us up. While we were driving and talking it dawned on me that we were not in the right place. Eventually Courtney reached a spot in her hike where she had some cell service so she called us. We unraveled the mystery, set a new meeting point, and Court and Casey eventually were able to rescue us. 
We did some shopping at EMS, had lunch at Chili's and then the girls brought me back to the trail and Wonder home. I started hiking again at 2:30. I was able to do enough miles so I can reach Kevin's family in Hanover tomorrow.
Not much to report about happenings while hiking. Since we have now split off from the long trail and it is a weekday, I do not expect to see a lot of hikers. Today I did not see any one until reaching the shelter.","Stealth Site

I made the false assumption that there was not going to be much elevation change so did not bother to look at the book or plan for the day. After the first climb of Moose mountain I checked the terrain for the day. It included three hard New Hampshire climbs with no switchbacks. It reminded me of North Carolina months ago. I was exhausted by the end of the day but managed to reach the fire wardens cabin at the top of Smarts mountain to take the last available spot in the cabin. The other five spots were already taken by section hikers. There were no real spots to put down my three person tent so I would have been very unhappy to have to keep going. Had some beautiful views because it was a clear day and several view spots with all the climbs. The most exciting point of the day came when I saw a small bear cub only about 40 yards away. It was hanging out on a dirt road close to the famous ""ice cream mans"" house. The bear sort of stared me down while I tried to stay still and take a picture. It slowly wandered into the woods after about 30 seconds. For the next several minutes I was on high alert for mama bear, but luckily she did not appear to be around.

Had some very interesting conversations about the vote in England to withdraw from the EU. It was great to hear thoughts from a well informed European. Had several trail magic events. One from a man named Carl and his wife. He had a list of thru hikers he had been following on trail journals and was able to guess who I was from his list. It was enlightening to see how creative some people are in trying to follow and help hikers. I saw him again later in the day as he was using his construction skills to improve on one of the popular sites for hikers to get water. The best trail magic came from Wonder and my daughter Kristin. They met me and the Spaniard about 10 miles into our hike. They had sandwiches, fruit and cold drinks. Then at the 15 mile mark they met me again. Wonder and I shared a sub, had more cold drinks, then Wonder accompanied me for the last five miles of the day. It was great to have her company. It also was kind of a test to see how her knee would feel without a pack. She was successful in the hike but her knee was not happy at all. Another milestone met right at the end of the day, just under 400 miles to go. Taking a day off tomorrow at home in Pike, my body really needs a rest.

I am not sure how some of the terrain can be climbed in the rain. The descent from North Kinsman had every type of step you can imagine. There were rock steps, board steps rebarred into the rock, steps carved out of the stone, as well as ladder steps. All were very steep and tricky. The weather cleared as we began to descend the Kinsmans so we had some nice views. Saw very few people except for some families when we reached our first hut in the White's. Very tiring but productive day. I can certainly see why many hikers slow down in the White's. Had a nice dinner with Northstar, his wife, and Wonder.

Northstar stayed for a while waiting for it to clear while I headed on since I am slower. Unfortunately not long after, I missed a turn and went .6 miles on the wrong trail until I figured it out. I had to backtrack and get on the correct trail. For most of the rest of the day I hiked alone trying to catch Northstar who had passed me by during my detour. The clouds cleared and the rest of the hike was clear with beautiful views. I crossed several streams and saw a couple small waterfalls. Other than a few day hikers towards the end of the hike I saw no people. I could tell from talking to the day hikers that Northstar was just ahead of me. I was surprised when I got to the trailhead before him. As it turns out he detoured into a shelter a couple miles before the end of the hike so I must have passed him there. Since we were in the valley most of the day there was no cell service, not even in the parking lot. I wonder what we would have done if we had been more separated.

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540722,"Just over a week ago a very good friend and supporter Tanya wrote to me saying she used our hike as a lesson on perseverance for Jr. Worship at church. Today's blog will not be about the details of my hike, although it was the hardest day yet, it will be about the lesson I witnessed today about perseverance and resilience. I did ""work for stay"" at the Lakes of the Clouds hut last night. This is a program that allows thru hikers to stay on the dining room floor of the hut and eat leftovers when the paying guests are done with their meals. In exchange you do some simple work for the staff for two hours. Because I was doing this I got to observe dinner but not really meet with the guests. I saw several interesting people and/or families. This post is about one of those families. It is relevant to start by saying that just after dinner one of those epic thunder and lightning storms hit us in the cabin. It lasted for a good part of the night. At one point the rain was coming down so fast the water from the eaves of the roof poured off as if they were coming from a fire hose. I was told that we received over 2"" of rain during the storm. This means the terrain for the day's hike would be extra wet.One of the families that I observed and later got to speak with briefly was a younger couple, very fit, I believe they both had Crossfit related shirts on. I guessed that they are competitors. They had a five-year-old daughter, Lili, with them. I believe they had hiked up the Amanoosic Trail to the hut that day. This is a very strenuous hike for anyone, so I thought it was cool that a five-year-old had done it. As it was clear that the weather was bad and the forecast for the next day was for heavy winds several people asked me my thoughts on the hiking conditions. Since I have hiked this particular route many times in the past I did have some appropriate advice. Lili's dad told me that they were considering going to the summit and taking the Cog Railway down instead of hiking back down the Amanoosic. I agreed because all the water would make the Amanoosic even more difficult. It was 1.5 miles to the summit, but the water was the unknown. About the first half mile, through the Lakes, is relatively flat. The problem is there is a lot of standing water to dodge and that might now be totally submerged. He decided heading for the summit was the best bet.My work for stay was done in the morning after breakfast. While the paid guests were packing up for their hikes I was sweeping floors and cleaning bunks. When I was wrapping up I saw the family again. They had just come back in from outside. I spoke with dad again and he said they were back for a second time because Lili was scared. It is important to tell you about the conditions. We were in clouds. It was foggy and wet, both on the ground and in the air. Worst of all the wind was howling. The forecast was for 60 mph winds with gusts up to 80 or 90. The parents worked on boosting her confidence while I was packing up my gear. They left for the third attempt while I finished packing and thanked the staff for letting me stay. I was just a few minutes behind the family so caught up quickly. Since it was really hard to see the trail; just barely able to make out the next cairn, and the fact that I had an app on my phone that tracked my progress on the trail via GPS I decided it would be safer for all if I tagged along with them to make sure they stayed on the trail. I asked mom if she was ok with me tagging along and she seemed happy to have that additional comfort. I followed behind and just watched as we went along. What an inspiration for me. After the first half mile of puddles and standing water there is about a mile of climbing over nothing but volcanic rock beds. Assuming you stay on the trail these rocks tend to be 1 to 2 feet long. I watched Lili fight her way over these rocks sometimes holding mom's hand and sometimes on her own. She is only about 3 feet tall so she had to ""bear crawl"" over a lot of it. So just picture, the wind is howling (at one point it blew my pack cover off), her feet are getting soaked by stepping in cold puddles, and her hands/gloves are getting wet because she has to bear crawl. She just trooped right along without whining or complaint. At one point, while she was holding her mother's hand her mother got knocked off her feet by a gust of wind. She just kept on. Our group actually passed one of the staff carrying garbage to the summit as well as a tour group. When we had about .3 miles to go, Lili wanted to take a quick break. It was clear they were going to make it. I went on ahead because I needed to get to the gift shop before they arrived. My girls will understand this, I had to get a commemorative pin for Lili. The tradition in our family was that you earned this badge of honor when you completed an adventure like this. I found the one I wanted, it was an ""I climbed to the top of Mt Washington"" pin. The family arrived not much later. They allowed me to give her the pin. I was so impressed with her accomplishment and used the pin to tell her so. This has turned out to be a very long winded tale, but I was trying to capture how moving the event was. Not only was Lili amazing but the parents showed true resilience when faced with one of those tough parenting decisions. They had to make a choice, neither option was easy, and they had to see it through. They were tested because Lili was scared and they had to backtrack twice. Not once did I see anger, frustration, or yelling. The parents just put on that face of determination and got it done always being supportive to each other and LiIi. I was truly impressed by the whole family and feel blessed to have been a small part of their adventure. My only regret is that I did not get a chance to talk to them more and learn a bit about their story.As an afterward, their adventure was not done. Way in the beginning of this I mentioned their plan after reaching the summit was to take the railroad down. As it turns out, while I was in the gift shop, they made an announcement that the railroad was closing for the day and the last train was leaving now. So by the time the family reached the summit the last train was gone. I am pretty sure they ended up getting a shuttle instead. This was a blessing in disguise. I stayed at the visitor center for another 45 minutes, partly to dry out and warm up, partly in hopes the weather would clear (it did not). About an hour after departing to continue my hike I was still close to the rail tracks. I heard the whistle of the train. When the winds are very strong, I believe 60 mph or more, the train is required to stop and wait for the wind to die down. So they missed the last train, but I believe that train ride, because of the wind, was a horror story of its own.","Lakes of the Clouds Hut

We all started hiking together but within minutes the young boys were way ahead of me. It was another hard day of climbs but I enjoyed being able to go at my own speed. I saw many day hikers and families as well as a few southbounders. It was a bit windy but it helped keep the temps down. I stopped at the Carter Notch hut for lunch. It was at a nice site with two ponds nearby. I had a nice conversation with the two hut workers who were there. I left about 2 pm and realized I had not even reached the halfway point for the day. I had to move a lot faster for the afternoon but at least I could look forward to a zero day with Wonder. I finished just before 8 pm. At the parking lot I met Magic and several other thru hikers. I have not seen Magic in months. It was nice to catch up with him. It is amazing to me how fluid our pack of hikers is. We were together for weeks then slowly split up, some faster and some slower. It appears now that we are beginning to come together again. Today's milestone is just under 300 miles to go. As the young boys told me today, that is 15 twenty mile days or 20 fifteen mile days.

They all planned on staying at the shelter and campsite that I am at. There is not enough space for that many tents so the last group in will have a problem. The shelter is not full. I am surprised that there are no southbounders here. I got an early start today so it was nice to be done at 4:30. Another sunny day with a breeze so it was not too hot. Some more great views and no wildlife. There was a lot of moose scat. Best part of the day was passing into Maine. I am in the last state. Also passed 1900 miles. Worst part of the day was the last half mile. My map had the shelter before a spot called the ledges. It turns out the shelter was after the ledges. I went back and forth trying to find how I missed the shelter and finally came to the conclusion that the map was wrong. So I had to do the ledges to get to the shelter. The ledges were huge vertical rocks that were very treacherous. After finishing that short section I wonder how southbounders can get up these crazy rocks. Not my issue.","US-2

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541575,"Today was a short mileage day but very physically taxing. I hiked a good portion of it with Northstar, Phat Sister, and Lost Pony. We competed two of the classic Maine sections; Mahoosuc Notch and the Mahoosuc Arm. I was concerned about the Notch because it was supposed to be a mile long boulder scramble where you have to pick your way over, under and through huge boulder formations. I am claustrophobic so I was uneasy about the under and through part. As it turns out it was not a big deal, there were some cave type action but very short and you could always see out. Also my hiker friends kept an eye on me. By far the hardest part of the day was the climb into the Notch and out of the Notch (the climb out for us was the Arm). I do not know why there is a name for the way up and not the way down because they seemed to be the same. Only hiked 9.5 miles but my knees hurt and I feel like it was more than a full day. For the first time I had to pay $10 to stay in a shelter, AMC seems to constantly find ways to get money from you.","Carlo Col Shelter

No complaints, have a dry bed, did laundry, and had a great double burger with guacamole for dinner. Still seeing steady stream of southbounders.

I will try to be more positive now.I could complain that I fell hard three times, but instead I will be happy I did not get hurt, just a few scratches. I could complain that the terrain was very hard, instead I will be happy that the first six miles was enjoyable. I could say I am tired of the constant steep up and down over boulders, or I can appreciate the new twist that the intermittent flat stretches are now rooty bogs.

Off to the trail head and I realized that I left my hiking poles in NH! Mike came through and lent me his piles. Thank you Mike! Northstar wished us luck and happy hiking because he was doing an 18 mile day and we were doing 10 miles. We were surprised to see him hiking southbound towards us. Turns out he left some of his food in Mike and Diane's refrigerator. So Santa gave him our cheddar cheese and some beef jerky. He was thankful and hiked on them we saw him again hiking back to us to give Santa 10 dollars to say thank you and get Mountain Dew when he's in town.Our hike today was hard. Steep up over wet rocks and then steep down. The trail was very narrow and there were lots of false summits. The views at the top of Saddleback and Saddleback Junior were amazing. Almost worth the climb!We saw Uncareful and Fence today. They were fishing in one of the ponds we passed. Uncareful caught two trout but they were too small to keep. The funny thing about them was they met our daughter Kristin because she shuttled them when they stayed at the hostel near our home.We got into the shelter early and set up our stuff.

A strenuous climb up Mt Abraham but much easier than yesterday's climb. We could have hiked an extra 1.7 each way to summit but we chose not to. We didn't see anyone all morning until we went to Spaulding Mountain Lean-to for lunch. We met two southbounders. One said the terrain ahead was easy and one said it was hard. The beginning was nice with some short steep ups and downs but also some nice gradual trail.We saw a plaque to commemorate the finishing of the last section of the AT in 1937.We climbed Spaulding Mountain and it was a nice climb with some good views. Then we climbed Sugarloaf (also chose not to do extra miles to summit). The climb up was okay but the climb down was really hard. Lots of ""butt scooting"". We crossed a river and I slipped on a rock and fell backwards. Thankful to not have fallen in and thankful for not getting hurt.Then a mile climb to the campsite. There is a large group of French Canadians here and it was hard to find a tent site. Santa scouted around and got the tent up while I filtered water. We both drank a lot today so had to filter at lunch and dinner. The water here in Maine is cold and tasty.We have a seven mile hike up South and North Crocker mountains tomorrow.

Some hikers came in after dark and flashed their headlamps around, talked loudly and goofed around hanging their bear bags. Santa slept through it but I was annoyed. Sometimes you do get in after dark but be respectful to other hikers!Up early and I walked to the pond but no moose. We were packed up and on the trail by 5:45. Today was my last day to take morning antibiotics and I am hoping the morning nausea is over. Hard to hike when your stomach is revolting.Steep climb up South Crocker but it was short. Then straight down and up to North Crocker. We met the couple that tented near us last night. They are peak bagging the Maine 4000 footers. They were also annoyed by the shenanigans last night.Climbing down Crocker we saw Spoon (he carries a large spoon). He started in April and was moving fast. I noticed a watering can attached to his pack and asked about it. He carries it to use for a camp shower. Pretty clever- I wished I had thought of that!The rest of the day was mostly down but gradual and not as rocky.We got a shuttle into town and are staying at the Stratton motel. Clean, large tub, near a laundromat, restaurant and small grocery store. The guy who picked us up was from Alabama and thru hiked in 2010 and liked Maine so much he stayed.

The forecast was for possible thunderstorms, high winds and hail so I was quite anxious. Prayed for peace last night and most of today.We saw two groups of camp kids out for 3-4 day hikes, two southbounders and a section hiking couple but that was it. The Bigelows were beautiful with lots of pine and poplar trees. And moss- lots of green spongy moss. Unfortunately there were also lots of boulders to climb up, down and around. My feet, ankles and knees are sore from all the hiking today. We had a view from the first peak and could see forests, lakes and rivers. It was amazing. The second two peaks were shrouded in clouds so we didn't see anything. It's been awhile since I walked in a cloud and it was helpful today because it helped cool us off. It was a hot one today. Santa set a record. He rung out his shirt 4 times, his bandana 3 times and his shorts once! He's kinda gross when it's this hot and humid.When we got to the camping area the first tent platform was broken so we had to hike farther in to find another one.

The clouds helped keep our body temps down on this hot day.We hiked faster than we thought we would and got to the road crossing two hours earlier than we thought we would. The woman who owns Mountain Village Farm B&B came and picked us up. She spearheaded a movement to get Kingfield, Maine recognized as an AT trail town.

We did not need candy because the Marcotte Family sent us a box of candy to see us through to the end!We went to the same restaurant for dinner and enjoyed our meals immensely.

Then we went to the post office to mail home our stove (not going to cook anymore) and Santa's down jacket. They were closing the street and setting up booths for Kingsfield Days. Since our shuttle driver wouldn't be able to drive down to get us we walked over to her house. We got a late start today and didn't start hiking until 9.We only had one climb today and it was first thing. The weather is still hot and humid so the showers and laundry that we did in town were negated by our sweat within 10 minutes. After the initial climb the trail was all rocks, roots and bogs with some sweet smelling pine needle trail thrown in. We walked along West Carry Pond and stopped to eat lunch at the beach. It was a pretty 10 foot section of sand and not too buggy. Right after we sat down and opened up our subs (packed them out of town for lunch) it started to rain. We put down our lunch and put our pack covers on the backpacks and then sat down to eat in a light shower. When we were done we packed up and started hiking and it started to rain. It was nice for the most part- cooled things off and washed away our sweat. But after awhile we were done with the rain and it made the rocks and roots more slippery.We got to the West Carry Pond lean-to and thought about staying because it's near the water and we could go swimming. It was a really beautiful site. But the earlier rain and now the sun brought out the bugs. We walked to Harrison's Pierce Pond Camps and got a rustic cabin for the night. The price includes the cabin, a shower (with soap, shampoo and towel) and breakfast. The breakfast is 12 pancakes with blueberries, strawberries and raspberries, juice, milk and eggs. I am really excited for breakfast!Tomorrow we cross the Kennebec River. The river is too dangerous to ford so the ATC contracts with a guide who will ferry us across.

Tim made each hiker 12 pancakes (raspberry, apple and blueberry), eggs, sausage and a drink. We couldn't finish the pancakes so packed them out for lunch.The start of our hike was flat but rocky and rooty. We walked 3 miles to the Kennebec River where a ferryman took us across in a canoe. It's a wide crossing and the water level changes quickly and without notice when the hydroelectric companies up river release water.After the river crossing we started a gradual climb up Pleasant Pond Mountain. The last bit was steep and we could hear thunder so we tried to walk quickly. The summit was above treeline and a rocky ridge- we walked as fast as we could on the wet rocks. We had gotten off the ridge and into tree cover when the thunder really got close and loud. I asked Santa if we should stop and put up our tent and said we could if I found a spot. So I said, ""how about there?"" We set a record for putting up our tent! Just as the rain started and we were climbing in, I saw a southbounder going by and invited her to wait out the storm with us. She's from Italy and her trail name (for now) is Italia. She's a religion teacher in a public school. Italia came to the US on a car trip and stayed at a hostel in Manchester, Vermont and met some thru hikers. So she's going to hike from Katadhin to Vermont on her school break.

We both slipped and slid down the wet rocks. The last three miles were past bogs and beaver bogs and the trail was wet and muddy. Both of us have wet, disgustingly stinky feet, socks and shoes.Santa set up our tent to dry while I filtered water. We met a southbounder, Otter, from Canada at the lean-to.

There were two southbounders there so we talked with them a bit while we had a snack and some water. We also texted our girls and my sister to let them know we were doing okay- cell service has been spotty and sometimes they worry if they don't hear from us.We walked down the mountain and then had a nice hike along the river. We saw a man who was training for a 100 mile trail run. Today he was running 38 miles on the AT. We talked a bit about shoes and how slippery the rocks and roots are when they are wet.We came to a gravel road and took off our shoes and socks to see if they would dry out a bit. Walking along muddy boggy trail our shoes and socks get soaked. And wet feet lead to blisters. We were excited because we were 5 miles from our destination and we wanted to hang our clothes and tent on the line to dry out a bit.We moved on to our first river fording. We sat down and took off our trail shoes and socks and put on our crocks and waded in. It was an easy crossing and the water felt nice on our feet. As we were changing our shoes we heard thunder and started hiking fast because we had 3 miles to the lean-to. After a mile and a half it was clear we weren't going to beat the storm so we started looking around and I found a great stealth site.

Santa had the steak bomb, fries and two Mountain Dews. I had the Thanksgiving panini, fries, coleslaw and a soda. It was nice to sit out of the sun and have lunch. Plus we got to wash our hands with running water and soap before we ate!After lunch we had 10 more miles to the ranger station to sign up for the long distance hiker lean-to.Tomorrow we hike the last big mountain. I am driving Santa crazy because I am super nervous about it-especially because the forecast is for rain and thunderstorms.Off to bed so we can be up early to meet our friends Donna and Paul for the final climb.","Rainbow Lake Campsite

I was nervous about this hike. Southnounders have been telling us for weeks how hard it is and some went as far as to say this trail shouldn't be part of our adventure because it was too hard, too technical and too dangerous. I know that they haven't hiked as far as we have and that htis was their first mountain, but the dire warnings still messed with my head. Santa was understanding at first but now he just wants me to hike it and get over this fear. I am beyond excited that Donna and Paul, friends from home, are going to hike with us. We have talked about summitting together since this crazy idea occurred to us.
We spent the night in the shelter with Limbo and his wife (I can't remember her trail name at the moment). Their alarm went off at 5 and we all got up and started to get ready. It had rained all night so now wet rocks are factoring into my fears (and the thunderstorms that are predicted on the mountain). We weren't in a hurry because Donna and Paul won't be here until 6:30- that's when the gate to the park opens. They got up at 2am to make the drive to do this with us. Best friends ever!
All packed up and we met Donna and Paul, put our extra gear in their car and started up the mountain. I am calming down now and talking with Donna about everything that I can think of to distract myself. She's a good sport and keeps talking to me. Beautiful trail next to a large stream. As we climb we are lost in a cloud of fog. This happens to us every time we are on a mountain with spectacular views so I am not surprised. We pass day hikers that aren't sure about hiking because of the weather reports but we need to get this done today so we continue up.
It's a tricky trail with lots of boulders and some rebar to help you up the rocks. One piece of rebar is broken so I need a ""butt boost"" to get me up and over. It's harder for Donna because she is shorter than I am and she's hiking in a skirt. We keep up a reasonable pace and get to the top where Donna and Paul pull out devil dogs for me and a Mountain Dew for Santa. People who know how we like to celebrate! We stayed at the top taking pictures, talking about our journey and chatting with other hikers. There was only one other thru hiker, Future Dad"" at the top and he was new to us.
We had decided to go down the Abol Trail. We had to go up Hunt because that is the official AT route but going down was our choice. We thought it would be easier so we went for it. The trail was easier but it was still a steep boulder climb down. We didn't know that Donna was terrified of going down trails where you could see over the edge and what could happen if you slipped. It was so hard for her because the cloud cover had lifted and we could see off the edge of the mountain. Paul and Santa had her face the mountain and go down backwards with them coaching her where to put her feet and hands. I went ahead to scout the trail and report back if there was an easier way to get down. I felt awful because she came out to support me and this was so hard for her. But she made it down and said more than once that we would be friends again-maybe. But towards the bottom we were back in the trees and the guys went ahead to get the van and we got to chat about everything as we finished walking down the mountain.
Donna and I saw a family that we met on the mountain and the boys showed us how to get to the park ranger's office so we could meet Paul and Santa. They were concerned because they had seen us when we were going slowly and were very pleased to see that we had made it. Only the two boys had hiked the whole thing, mom and sister started up ad changed their minds.
It was the hardest mountain but I loved it. I am good at rock scrambling-when the rocks aren't wet and we weren't in a hurry and I wasn't feeling like I was slowing Santa down so I could relax and enjoy the climb. I am terribly sorry that my friend struggled so much psychologically with the climb. She was truly terrified- she loves me!","The Birches Lean-to

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544484,"*Editor's Note: Wonder wants to hike the entire trail this year, so she and Santa will be going on short trips and day hikes to finish up the bits she missed*Great dinner and sleep last night. Ready to finish this 5 day stretch. Mike, our friend in Rangeley and the guy who loaned me his poles, is going to hike the last day with us.It didn't start off well. Santa was going to choose between his running shoes and boots. The shoes didn't have insoles so it's the boots. They don't appear to be comfortable, and his pokes aren't working. He was able to fix one bit not the other. Going to be a long day.We are going 17.5 today. Santa remembers them as not being fun. We shall see.They weren't fun! Poorly marked and maintained trail. Rocks, roots and rain. All the NOBOs were complaining when they got to the shelter. So we weren't the only ones who didn't have fun today. The shelter is full as are the tenting platforms. It's crazy busy here.Got in late, ate dinner, smelled the pot the younger hikers were smoking and went to sleep. Someone's alarm went off three times! Most annoying!We met a young woman who is a teacher in New Jersey (so happy I teach where I do-it's ugly out there) who we saw at Harrison's. She is SOBO and still a happy hiker. And excited to get a trail name. She was so excited about the 12 patriotic pancakes that her name is now Pancakes. Didn't get a picture yesterday because of the rain but hopefully I will find one in my archive.Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day. We are only doing 9.5 but it's the Mahoosuc Notch and Arm so we will see how that goes.","Gorham, NH

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544485,"Interesting night in the shelter. A SOBO had his phone on and the alarm went off at 1am and his phone rang later on in the night.We were up and out to do the ""most difficult or most fun mile"" on the AT. It was a difficult hike to the Notch because the rocks were still wet from the rain yesterday and there were a lot of rocks! The Notch wasn't too bad. We felt it was more or less the AT in NH and Maine- lots of rocks, very few blazes. The rocks were bigger and we got to crawl through some spaces. There was still snow and ice in some crevices and the air was noticeably cooler. We got water at the stream and it was frosty good! I had a moment when I was on a rock and had to get to the other side by jumping over a very steep crack in the rocks- I was super scared and afterwards came very close to hyperventilating. That wasn't much fun. After the Notch we had a super steep climb up the Mahoosuc Arm to get to Speck Pond where we were going to spend the night.There is a group of 4 sheltering- parents and their grown children who are hiking plus a lot of people tenting. There is a caretaker so it's a fee site. He does trail maintenance and keeps people from making a mess at the pond.It's a 17 mile hike tomorrow to Andover for our resupply. Excited to shower, do laundry and eat town food.We saw two people we know hiking today. One was a guy we met in Monson who remembered us because we have him some of our extra food. He fondly recalled the yumminess of the patriotic cupcakes the girls sent us. And we saw Itailia again. She shared our tent during an afternoon thunderstorm in the 100 Mile Wilderness. That added a lot of fun to our day.","Carlo Col Shelter

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544568,"We had some good chats with the older couple and their children last night. The Mahoosucs have not been good to them. He fell and broke his hip two years ago and she did something to her ankle yesterday. They had a four mile hike to their car today so I hope it went well. It was a tough four miles.The first 4 miles were the end of the climb up Old Speck Mountain. It wasn't any more fun than the earlier climb but it was over fairly quickly. Then we had a steep down with lots of ""butt scooting"" happening. Santa's shorts are beyond repair and headed for the garbage heap. After we went down up we went to Baldpate West then down and right back up Baldpate East. Steep granite climbs but on the peaks there were ledges and ledges mean blueberries!We climbed down and passed the Frye Notch Lean-to and met a hiker section hiking New England. He miscalculated how long it would take him and was low on food so I shared the extras in my food bag- I always have extra food.The hike after the lean-to to the road crossing where we were being shuttled into Andover was sweet. Gentle ups and downs on pine needle trail. There were some steep bits but not a lot so no complaints.Santa's feet are toast. He had raw bleeding blisters on his little toes and heels. It was painful watching him walk. I can't imagine how much it hurt him to walk. We discussed what we should do about my section into Rangeley. We thought about asking a friend to hike with me or me doing it myself. The tent would be hard for me to carry.While we were waiting for a shuttle, we talked with a young woman who has been slack packing. So I am going to slack pack the next three days and get this section done. A little nervous but eager to hike this section and be finished.Long day and now going to sleep with a belly full of town cheeseburger, salad, fries and a chocolate milk shake. Life is good.","Speck Pond Shelter

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544654,"We slept well in our cabin in the woods. I wasn't sure I would because I was a teeny tiny but nervous about hiking on my own. But I slept and even slept in until 6!Off to breakfast at The Little Red Hen. The cook's daughter has laminated sheets with book reviews, an ongoing story, a journal ... It was fun to read and her mom gave me copies to share with my friend Donna who teaches fourth grade. It could be a fun summer project.So, fueled on mixed berry pancakes, eggs and cranberry juice, I started my solo hike. I started with a climb. Took my time, stopped and had a few ""breath breaks"" and some water. Then down a steep trail with rebar ladders, wooden ladders, rebar banisters and stone steps. The MATC loves stone steps and so do I. Think about doing a few flights of stairs and it's tiring but fighting your way up slippery rock while doing the same climb is much harder. It's a lot of work to make these stairs and I appreciate it! We always stop to thank maintainers when we see them.I stopped at the Hall Mountain Lean-to for lunch (a salad I packed out, Bugles and a candy bar). I wasn't very hungry so didn't eat my tuna and tortillas. I talked with two NOBO hikers that weren't excited about the climb to come. It didn't help that water was sketchy and scarce. I am happy that I always carry a lot even though it's heavy.I called the hostel to tell them when to pick me up. We had a miscommunication and they were going to pick me up at 2. As I was leisurely hiking along, I did the math. Oh no! I would never make it. So I power hiked the last real climb of the day and called back. Thankfully I had service and was able to change time to 3.Back to my happy hike. I stopped at all view points, took pictures, talked with other hikers and meandered my way down the trail.Two couples with their dogs were hiking and when we stopped to chat with each other they told me about a moose bone farther down the trail. I got a picture and sent it to two people who have children that are following our journey. One last stop to admire the pond and then I hiked to the road. The hostel people weren't there but Santa was! And he had two ice cold bottles of juice for me.So my first day hiking in Maine on my own was sweet. Hoping tomorrow is as nice. And then a friend, who is contemplating his own thru hike, will join me for the third day.We met a man who shuttles for the hostel. He is a trail chaplain and this is how he's serving the trail this season. He and Santa got to chat at length when he gave Santa a ride to Gorham to get his truck. So we now have a church to visit in Littleton, a book to read and a video to watch. Meeting interesting people on the trail has been one of the most amazing parts of our journey.","East B Hill Rd

Cheryl and Kelly ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544773,"It was a chilly night in our rustic cabin. I slept with my liner plus the blanket but Santa was a little chilly with just the blanket. But all is good and we got up, dressed, packed up and off to breakfast. Back to The Little Red Hen for the hungry hiker breakfast- pancakes, eggs, bacon, home fries, hash and toast. I don't eat hash so Santa took care of that for me.My last day in Maine on my own. Started with a climb up Old Blue Mountain. Stopped at the viewpoints to take pictures and catch my breath. It's hot today do I started drinking my water early. I wasn't particularly enjoying the climb. About half way up I saw a SOBO who was ecstatic about spending the night on top of Old Blue. His enthusiasm made finishing the climb much easier.The middle part of the day was the usual ups and downs. The forest changed a lot and it made the hike much more interesting. At lunch time I was on top of the first Bemis Mountain peak and stopped to eat my salad, raspberry muffin, Bugles and M&Ms. Then I noticed all the blueberries- took an extra long break to pick and eat. Then I waked on lots of ledge but the climbs and downs were more gradual than usual and there were lots of blueberries. Not making great time but having fun.I ran out of water 2 miles from the end (the only water source I saw this stretch was a stagnant puddle). I wasn't in any danger but once you know you don't have water, you tend to get really thirsty. I had a mule climb down (steep, tricky and not fun) then a mile climb to meet Santa. As I was finishing the climb down I saw a red truck on the gravel road. I was excited because I thought Santa had come to meet me early and had drinks but also bummed because I wasn't going to be done and would still have a mile climb. But it wasn't Santa- it was Teddie and Bruce! They were trail angels with drinks and food. I had a coke, a water and another coke. Couldn't stay for a burger because Santa was waiting so I took two blueberry muffins to go. It was awesome to sit, rest and chat. I didn't see many people today so it was kinda lonely on the trail.As I climbed I saw Scootch, a SOBO we met earlier in Maine. We were going to chat but the trail angels were planning on packing up so I moved her along so she could get dinner and a drink.One last nasty climb and there was Santa. He brought me juice, a sandwich and watermelon. So I ate and told him about my day as we drove to Mike and Diane's cabin.They hosted us when I got back on the trail in Rangeley and Mike is going to hike my last 13 miles with me. Diane has lots of family visiting. We had a barbecue last night then Santa and I went off to sleep in our tent. It sprinkled last night so I am glad that we didn't cowboy camp.A little nervous about a new hiking buddy because it's always been Santa and I. I hope I don't slow him down too much! Mike says he doesn't talk much while hiking (I should be used to that). One more day in Maine!","South Arm Rd

They had a full house so we set up our tent and fell asleep listening to happy family noise as they played Monopoly.Mike and I were up early and Diane got up with us to make breakfast. Santa took us to the trail and Mike and I started our walk.We had a steep up to begin but then the trail eased into gradual ups and downs. We stopped at ponds to take pictures and ate some blueberries. Then Mike asked, ""Is that thunder?"" I answered, ""No, that's an airplane."" But then we heard it again and it was thunder. We still had lots of miles so we just hiked along and got sprinkled on.We stopped for lunch and Mike pulled out his maps. He is a map/compass hiker. I wish I was but I have spatial issues and maps are confusing to me. My Guthook app makes sense to me and is helpful. Mike did think we might be off the trail at one point because the area we were walking on was overgrown but we were still on the AT.It was great having company. We chatted about the trail, our families, religion and politics. It made the miles go quickly.Once we finished, Santa dropped Mike off at his house and I used the bathroom then Santa and I headed to Mass. We wanted to go to church in the morning, visit with a special little boy, see Santa's brother and then go to NH to see our girls. It's a busy life sometimes.","Rte 4
