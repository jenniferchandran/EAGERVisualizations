Much of my gear is the same, but I have upgraded a few items with newer lighter versions. Also, 1000+ miles and 2+ months taught me what I really need, so I'll start out with fewer items and a much lighter pack. I'm also smarter about food and a resupply, so I won't be taking ""too"" much this time. I'll also be using little or no resupply boxes. I was simply shipping myself too much food. I remember giving away food at Fontana Dam because I didn't need it.I'm also lighter and healthier. I've kept about 10+ pounds from my first attempt. On the downside I am older . Also, I'm planning on leaving in early March which will add a few colder weather items that I didn't need before.But when it all said and done, I will definitely be carry less on my back and around my waist.",,Experience,"Dec 16, Wed",0

I missed my wife, family, friends, ... I was worried about what I was missing out of their lives. And that taught me their value to me. Since coming back my relationship with my wife is much stronger, we take more time for each other. It recharged and reinvigorated are relationship (I used that as an excuse why another thru-hike would be a great idea, ""if the last one did that, just image want another one will do"").Another something I've gained, is the value of experiences over ""stuff"". The experience of that hike is still with me today and is as strong then as now. It's value to me is priceless, you can't buy that, you need to have done it, so you can claim is as your own. As for ""Stuff"", when your needs are broken down into 3 simply things: food, water and shelter and your goal is simply to get from point A to point B, you realize you don't need a lot of stuff to be happy and fulfilled.Related to the above, I've learned that life doesn't need to be extravagant, expensive, complicate, etc.. to be fulfilling, I happier keeping it simple.One last comment.

The reason, get this, they (senior management) didn't what to set a precedent. Honestly, how many people take 6 months off. I can see it now, that big stampede to the door, “Hey, everyone Timeout is taking 6 months off, let’s all go…”. Yeah, not going to happen. Oh, and let’s not forget I already was approved and took a 6 months’ LOA in 2013 (though I only ended up using 3 months). So I guess the precedent was already set, huh! I bet if I checked, I’m probably the only one who’s taken a personal LOA longer that 6 weeks it the last decade. With no LOA, that leaves staying on or resigning. Well, dropped off the resignation letter this morning. (Honestly, I knew the LOA was an outside chance at best). So, with the resignation thing done, I’m all in now. Got to say it is a little bit liberating and troublesome all at the same time. Liberating in the sense I can put all the second guessing, sleepless nights, etc… behind me now and focus on getting ready. Troublesome, in it that this is the first time since 1984, 32 years, I haven’t had a job (I guess that’s liberating too).16 days from now “I’ll be back”. Can’t wait! Lot more anxious this time around, maybe I’ll say more about that later.Well, I still have two weeks of work ahead of me, and I’ll need to take care of all the HR stuff, so it is not all care free yet, so back reading journals, Oops, I mean work.",,Committed!,"Feb 18, Thu",0

I could just hear them after I left, ""Do you see that honey! That was the ""real"" thru hiker in the wild, in it's natural habitat! Did you smell him? Did you see the way he was eating, hunched over his food like some kind of cave man.""The shelter ends up being full, top and bottom, and there are even a few people outside tenting.   The wind blows all night long, with rain coming and going, but I'm warm and dry.","Cherry Gap Shelter

Well a relatively light pack is not the same as slack packing (that's what I did in 2013), and even though I made good time I has getting tried and now knew I would arrive later than I planned/liked, more like 3:00.

The day started out with ""spitting"" rain, and overcast skies, actually not too bad hiking weather as it kept you cool and could move quickly.
The last half of the roller coaster was (or at least to me) much easier than the first half and I cleared it about an hour and a half later.
The next third of the trail was very easy and pleasant. Some of traveling through open fields.
I made it to David Lesser shelter around 10:30, and stopped in to use the privy. That isn't what I really writing about. It was I didn't get a really good vibe from one of the hikers. She was wearing jeans, talking to herself, etc..., so I walked right by the shelter and straight to the privy. After doing my business, I headed right out. It's actually a good thing I did, because I came to find out later, at the hostel, that other thru hikers staying at the shelter had even weirder experiences with this women and one even went so far to alert the park service.
Well the last third of the hike into Harpers Ferry was pretty rocky, and with my beat up trail runners and feet, it definitely wasn't the most pleasant miles I've walked, but I got them done and arrived in Harpers Ferry around 2:00.
I checked into the ATC, had my photo taken and number assigned. I'm hiker #68 starting from Springer Mountain heading North bound for the year. 
This is really a big deal for me. Not the actual number, but getting to Harpers Ferry, getting my picture taken, number assigned and put in the book.
I haven't written anything about it, but I have talked to family and fellow thru hikers about my strong desire to get to Harpers Ferry. Getting there or not, has weighed heavily on me all throughout this first 1000 miles. I had to make it back to Harpers Ferry, where I got off in 2013 or everything I'd been doing for the last two months would have been for nothing (at least that how I felt). If I didn't make it back, I might have just as well started in Harpers Ferry and been a LASHER (Long Assed Section Hiker). So making it here, has real significance to me, almost but not as much as Katahdin. 
So now I'm taking a break, probably 7 zeros, all part of my plan. I'm heading home to attend my daughter's wedding shower, celebrate, reconnect with my family, rest up and fatten up for the next half of my journey.

Timeout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533616,"We wake up with the plan to do the same thing today (e.g. doing 20+ miles and push past the shelter for an easy walk into town). The weather is supposed to be pretty good, cloudy and in the high 50s, but the weather man got it wrong. It is a cloud, windy day with occasional sleet. I'm worried about camping because I have my hammock.But even though my thoughts are on the weather, we do have moments of sunshine and great views. One of the best is the rock scramble climb out of Leigh Gap. Gorgeous and fun, sometimes it is hand holds and straight up over steep rock faces. Good times.  The Pennsylvania rocks stretches are a little longer, but still not too bad because they are flat and always broken up with easy flat terrain.
We get to the shelter by 3:00, but the weather has turned. Dark sky's, sleet and dropping temperatures. We decide to stay and not risk it.
The shelter quickly fills up, bumble bee and tomahawk taking the last places. And, ""YES"", tomahawk has my shoes. As thanks, I do the .2 mile trek down hill to get their water.","Campsite

Wolf Rock is actually quite fun, big rocks you need to hop/jump from one to another. A section hiker actually recommend we take a blue blaze trail to by pass them. Why?After Wolf rock the trail gets easier. We pass a number of section hikers, chatting it up and taking our time.We still make it into Delaware water gap by 3:00.
