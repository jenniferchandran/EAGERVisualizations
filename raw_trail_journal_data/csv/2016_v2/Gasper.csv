Gasper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/478850,"    Looked at various options for a trail journal today.   Trying to get this set up so it is easy to use on the trail from an iPhone.   Don't know if that is possible yet.    I have always wanted to hike the AT and figure I better get started while I'm still healthy enough to even consider it.    Have a pack, tent, sleeping bag, air mattress. Need to really work on my cooking system as what I have now is too heavy and big. Also need to figure out a water purification system.    Have not picked a start date other than sometime in March of 2015.

Fell twice while bushwacking through a vary dense area.   Injured my ribs where I fell on my rifle, but X-rays a week later showed no broken bones.   Set out some bait in the same area 1/21/15.   Digging holes in clay with lots of roots is hard work. Filled the holes with corn, jello, dry yeast and 2 liters of red soda pop.

A fellow Marine (Gulf War) has been my hiking partner since yesterday afternoon. No trail name, but goes by Curtis Schmitt.
Needed to drop a load at lunch so went off and found a place, lashed my treking poles together, propping one end on a rock. Proceeded to do my business when the pole I was sitting on broke. Thank goodness for duct tape!
At mile 14.9 we crossed a stream so took off boots and waded in the cold water for a few seconds. The inserts the VA had made have prevented any plantars faceitis pain. Thank you tax payers. 
Got to Gooch Mtn Shelter area at 5:50 PM. Not a single level place to set up a tent. Swore my feet were going to go thru the bottom of my tent. Got to bed at 9:40. 57 degrees in tent, but feels warmer. Curtis is still with me.","Hawk Mtn Shelter

Gasper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/486413,"Woke up to rain at 7:10.   My tarp fly over my tent caused the tent to leak where it touched. Seemed to take forever to pack up in the rain. Used the privy. Never left Gooch Mtn shelter until 10:15 AM. Left my green Nalgene water bottle hanging on a tree.   Just as Curtis and I were leaving, All's Well showed up. He had camped back at the creek we waded in yesterday. He joined us.     The hike was slow with wind that kept blowing the hood of my rain coat off, rain and even some sleet.    Made it 5.2 miles to Woody Gap, Mile 21, and decided to find a place to stay in Suches, GA. It was really cold when you stopped walking so we all huddled into the men's room: 5 guys and 3 girls.   Astro Wooky stood on the stool and played her guitar!   It was about 4:00 when the shuttle from the Hostil finally showed up: a quad cab pickup. All's Well, Curtis & I were about frozen.   Hostil was packed, but some young guy gave me a bottom bunk and he moved to the top. Someone stole his whole backpack during the night. There were 26 people in 3 small rooms who shared one bathroom and one shower. The 3 of us had a load of laundry done for $5 and had pizza for supper. The bunks were $20 each. Lots of snoring during the night.   One young guy from California intended to start running on the trail, but hadn't as a girl he was kind of watching over wasn't fairing very well and he didn't want to leave her, but he assumed she would be quiting soon. He didn't have a backpack or sleeping bag.   He had a coat, sneekers and a few things in two plastic shopping bags + a smart phone... a real minimalist.   I bought some gloves that I hoped would keep my hands dryer and warmer.","Gooch Mtn Shelter

Weighed my pack: 44 lbs with food and water.   Shuttle got us back to woody gap at 11:15. Trail was very steep at first, but then not too bad.   Lance Creek was the last place you could camp before you got into an area where they required a bear canister for camping. Since we didn't rent or buy bear canisters, it made for a short day.   There were actually about 4 almost level tent pads in this camping area. The one I selected had just had some work done on it and there was a lot of loose dirt around.  Some girls took a picture of the 3 wise men on my phone.  Sprinkled as we were fixing supper so that made the pad a muddy mess.   Astro Wooky gave us a concert before we went to bed at 8:35.

Arrive Blood Mtn Shelter (beautiful stone structure) at 1:00 and left at 2:00.   Met a Venture Crew there. Lots of barren rock to cross on the top of the mountain just past the shelter. Coming down the rock stairs was very slow and dangerous. Got to Nells Gap at 4:00
 Bought new treking poles, a small fuel canister, a Nalgene bottle and a light weight shirt.   Mailed home 8 lbs of gear. That cost me $191.11. 
Dutchman handed me a beer as I was going to check the trail box. Only found some powdered drink mix by Starbucks that I took.
   All's Well got us a cabin, Boars Head, where he cooked pizza and spagetti. My share was $26.    I slept on 2nd floor and managed to bang my head a half dozen times on the low sloped ceiling.    As I recall it was about 7:30 when I went to bed.","Lance Creek

We stoped on Poor Mtn and stelth camped at 5:30 at about mile 40.9 for a 9.2 mile day.    While eating a ramon noodle supper, I choked really hard as I was rushing to get done when I realized the arm of my coat was getting wet as I wasn't under my tarp enough.   Thought the choking sensation went away and tried to eat some more, but that made me vomit a little.    Gave up and went to bed at 7:00 with it still raining hard.","Neels Gap

At 2:55 we were at mile 49.3, just beyond Red Clay Gap.   The Blue Mtn trail was VERY rocky and made for very slow going as like crossing a boulder field.   Fell 3 times today, twice tripping on rocks/roots and the 3rd time my left knee just buckled and down I went. That was on the decent from Blue Mtn and very close to Hwy 75 where we arrived at 6:00 PM.    Janne, All's Well's wife, was to meet us there, but had gone to the wrong place first so was a little late getting there at 7:00.   We went to their RV in Hiawassee, showered and changed clothes and then went out to eat.   It was an all-you-can-eat place so we really chowed down for only $9.00 per plate. Stopped at an Ingles grocery store on way home and I bought Propel, breakfast bars and some snacks + some generic reflux medication. Sleeping in the RV was a luxury!   My feet were just throbbing so I sat in a chair with my feet up on the bed until 1:00 AM and my feet felt better. Was cool in the house so slept in my jacket.","Poor Mtn

Got to the trail head on Hwy 75 and left at 9:04.   Two long mountains to climb, over 2000 ft.   Stopped at mile 55.6, Indian Grave Gap, for lunch at 11:30.   Got to the Tray Mtn Shelter area at 4:10   Someone doesn't know how to make drains off the side of the trail. This group had dug dips from 12"" to 24"" deep and 5 to 6 ft wide right through the tread and grade of the trail.   Going down hill, it felt like you stepped off a cliff. Then a big broad mound to climb over on the bottom side of the dip. Going up hill, it felt like your toe would touch your shin the grade was so steep.   That should cause water coming down the hill to speed up and erode the dip even deeper so it will just get worse over time.   Add this to the fact that GA doesn't belive is switch backs and you go straight up and down hills and to the very top of every hill to see the 'view', and it made for a long tough day. Hours and miles were short, but pain in legs was rough.   A man from upstate NY gave me a pound of cheese and half a pack of pita bread that the 3 wise men shared.   
Today was very 'international' with people from Germany, Switzerland, & Italy. One young American had just lost his job in Ireland and was hiking the trail with his dad.

She had a big meat loaf supper waiting for us!
Went down a very steep trail to get water today. Very small stream. Put 55 cups of water into my cloth bucket. Curtis helped me lug it up the hill. After everyone had water from it, Curtis went to dump out the last few cups and there appeared to be gold dust and flakes in the bottom of the bucket. (Later, in the RV, we concluded it was just fools gold).
    Helen had left a phone msg and said Verizon would not talk to her as her name was not on the account.   From the top of a mountain I called Verizon and wasted 30 minutes going from one set of phone options to the next to end up at a dead end and having to start over.   Later I finally got to a human and after 15 minutes she finally got Helen's name added to the account.
When we stopped from lunch there was a lady from Austrailia, Jump Bear, who had hired a guide for her trek. He looked kind of weird and had a pit bull with him. I asked her what 'Jump Bear' was and she said to goole it.

Cold and windy, then calm and warmer:   hard to stay layered effectively. Opted for being on the cold side most of the time.   Had lunch at Bull Gap from 12:00 to 12:54.    Got to the GA-NC border at 3:55 and a lady took a couple pictures of the 3 wise men.   Then it was just a short distance to Bly Gap where we arrived at 4:05.   Water was easy to get from a pipe in the stream in the middle of the camping area.   Wind was very strong and it was cold, especially if not moving. There were NO level spots so I opted for the uphill side of a big tree just about a 100 ft below the crest of the ridge. Wind wasn't too bad there. Curtis and All's Well set up a little futher down the slope and had more wind.   Went to bed shortly after supper and it was still bright so sewed up a tear in my knee brace and a hole in the external pocket of my backpack.

One was just a fly with no sides so he/she must have froze.   Found a coat in the trees and set it in the stump of a tree near the tents so I wouldn't blow away.   Trail started off very steep and then turned very rocky which both made for slow going.   Had hoped for more swithch backs in NC, but that wasn't the case today.   At 4:10 we stopped about 0.1 miles short of Standing Indian Shelter as there was a nice narrow depression to keep the wind down and a large creek running thru the middle of the area.   Of course it was not level.

Trail had few loose rocks and more switchbacks so much easier. Drains were properly built too. Snow was still on the ground in the shaded areas.
Our camp site was just off the trail and there was a good spring near by. Chip camped with us. He had bought a lighter tent at Neel's Gap (1lb, 2 oz) for only $109 which I thought was a great deal for both the price and the light weight.

Woke up Curtis and All's Well at 7:00. Based on what was in my cup that I had left out, we got 1.5"" of rain. Luckily it quit at 7:00 and we packed up our wet gear and hit the trail at 8:10.  Neither Curtis or All's Well have any prior backpacking experience, but both are ready to go at least 10 minutes before I'm ready, and I usually start 10 minutes before I wake them up. Their skills continue to amaze me.   Trail wasn't bad until we got to Mooney Gap and USFS 83. From there is was rock, like an old lava flow and almost vertical. Had to crawl on hands and toes in some places as very steep and no place to dig trekking poles into. I was scared of falling over backward it was so steep in places.   At the top of Albert Mountain was a fire tower, but since it was all fogged in, I didn't see any point on climbing all those stairs and headed off down the trail while Curtis and All's Well checked out the fire tower.   There was a large room at the top of the tower that would have been a great place to say as protected on all 4 sides (instead of 3 in the shelters)   The rest of the day the trail was excellent for the most part. Very few loose rocks, not too steep and the trail was well built.   A few spots where the tread was only a foot wide and held up by a rotten log mayed you wonder if it would hold, but it did and got by with no problems. Got to Long Branch shelter exit at 11:35. Trail wend down the creek for a hundred yards or so: very pretty.   We ate lunch where the trail left the creek.   Got to Rock Gap Shelter at 1:58 and to Walace Gap at 2:10. There was a parking area there with a half dozen vehicles.   There were bear proof trash cans where we were able to get rid of some weight.   Walked a little futher and got to W. Old Murphy Road.    All's Well and I were pooped so decided to try hitch hiking from there, mile 106.7. Curtis walked on to Winding Stair Gap.   Wasn't long a a couple in a small Jeep picked us up and took us to McDonald's in Franklin, NC, about 11 miles east of the trail. With two packs, the Jeep was very crowded, but we managed.   Had a Big Mac, coke and a coffee.   In 14 days I hiked 106.7 miles (+ miles to camp area, water, etc.) on the trail for an average of 7.62 miles per day. My legs were no stronger and my bad left knee was not feeling any better. On a steep hill I was till gasping for air after a dozen steps so my speed was very limited by that. At that rate, it was going to take me 9.6 months to complete the trail. I decided to bail.   Called for a rental car and they picked me up at 4:00. Got the paper work taken care of and went back to McDonals and Janne showed up at 4:15.   Curtis called at 4:30 and said he had made to to Hwy 64 so I followed All's Well and Janne out to the trail head to say goodby to Curtis and all.   Drove back to Franklin, rented a room in the Sapphire Inn for $40 cash, hung out my tent to dry on the railings in front of my room. Mona and her blood hound checked in shorly after I did, but couldn't find her.   Went out to eat, but most resturants had closed. Ended up at the Frogtown Market where I had a nice catfish dinner.   Then drove to WalMart and bought a 6 pack of beer. Found a NC map at the customer service counter and as I was paying for that, the plastic bag handle on my beer broke and 5 bottles exploded on the floor.","Betty Creek Gap

Gasper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/486832,"Frustrated that after the 2nd day on the trail I couldn't access TrailJournals and also not getting email so my complaints never got answered. Every time I changed locations I had a different cell tower and a different IP address which TrailJournals blocked as it didn't recognize it. Frustrated that most of the time TraiJournals does not recognize new paragraphs and runs everthing together. 
Curtis and All's Well had in-line water filters that froze up when it got cold as did the tube on their water bladders. Althogh slower to purify water, my steriPen worked great in all conditions. The mouth piece on my bladder leaked so I gave up using it the last couple days. It was too cold to have my cloths soaked.
Hope to go to Trail Days in Damascus, VA in May and see all the gear on display. Maybe get some more ideas for trail food? Maybe do some section hiking and try to meet up with Curtis and All's Well some place?
iPhone wasn't very easy to use as it took so long to power up. That made it usless for quick photos. Seldom had more than one bar signal and most of the time that wouldn't even let me use the phone or text. Sometimes on moutain top in high wind could get a signal for the phone, but only received a handful of emails in 14 days on the trail. The PowerTank I bought at WalMart kept it charged although most of the time it was in airplane mode with the power off.
Met many wonderful people on the trail. We were all trying for the same goal so it made for instant friendships. Never missed TV or newspapers and even went to bed instead of staying up to see the UK-Notor Dame game while at All's Well's RV. Got plenty of sleep. 
Based on the time from when we hit the trail until we stopped in the afternoon (i.e. including all rest stops, lunch, etc.) I averaged 1.17 mph which is miserably slow. In some places where I felt it was dangerous (steep, poor footing, etc.) I went slow on purpose, but most of the time, I was going just as fast as I could gasp for air... and that is very slow. Watching young people whiz buy and making 15 or more miles per day (compared to my average of 7.6 miles/day) was kind of depressing.
Never did sleep in a shelter as didn't like the idea of sharing with mice. Maybe I could set up my tent inside the shelter?
My trail partners, Curtis and All's Well, were very patient with me. I led our little group the first 12 days. On the 13th day, Curtis took the lead, then me, then All's Well. On the 14th day, both Curtis and All's Well were in front of me.
This was a great experince and glad I gave it a try. 106.7 miles and 14 days on the trail was quite the adventure for a 73 year old guy. (Never met anyone onlder on the trail, but I'm sure there are some older ones out there still).
Very thankful that God kept me safe. A friend, Tom Wyres, who I met an an REI class in early March started on the trail 3/24 and had almost caught up to me when he fell and did a face plant. Thought he heard bone break when he hit, but X-rays never showed anything. He was by himself, an hour before dark, when he came to. No one else on the trail so he started backtracking. Finally found a fella that picked the dirt out of the blood on his face and helped him get to a road where he got to an emergency room in Franklin. He is home now and called me 4/05/15 to see if I wanted to join him when he went back 4/11. He was covering up to 25 miles in a day so there is no way I could keep up to him.",,Another time,"Mar 31, Tue",0
