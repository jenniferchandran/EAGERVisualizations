Mudflap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534106,Went to Trail Days for the tenth anniversary of the 2006 thru hikers in Damascus. Had a great time at Trail Days. Always have a good time when we get together with RXR and Critter. Right now I will be hiking with a friend from Cornwall Bridge Conn. To Great Barrington MA. That will finish everything south of Manchester Center VT. Will fly out on May 20 and start hiking on the 21st. I hope to journal from the trail if possible. Looking forward to getting back on the trail.,,View Entry,"May 17, Tue",0
Mudflap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534789,Today Jerry and I took a flight to Hartford Conn. It was the first time using Uber for me. It was a great experience. Our flight was on time and uneventful. Our shuttler will pick us up and take us to the trail near Cornwall Bridge Conn. Looking forward to hiking will my friend Jerry. We did the approach trail to Neels Gap in 2010.,,View Entry,"May 20, Fri",0
Mudflap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534802,After we ate breakfast at our hotel. Hope picked us up and drove us to the AT near Cornwall Bridge. She was on time and she was very pleasant and she even had fuel for our stove. It was her first shuttle and she was great. We started hiking about 9am and the weather is great. We had a bunch of small up and downs all day. We ate some lunch at Pine Swamp Brook Shelter. We were tired and didn't get in until 6 pm. We saw several day hikers and some section hikers. No thru hikers yet. We could see Limerock raceway park from Hand Glider View. There were cars on the track at the time. Jerry's boot toe was starting to separate and I broke one of my trekking poles. I think his boots will make it but my pole will have to be fixed when I get back. There were some others hikers at the campsite but we never saw anyone. Long day with travel but a good day.,"Cornwall Bridge CT

Mudflap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534896,"I got out of my tent and used the exposed privy and retrieved our food bags from the tree. Jerry was still sleeping. He wasn't thrilled with the privy. It had no privacy but you couldn't see it from the campsites. You could make you presence known if you listened for someone approaching if need be. I know of one in VA where it's in good sized clearing where someone would just walk up on you sitting upon the throne. Any way it's much better than nothing at all. By the time we packed up tents and ate some bars for breakfast it was 7 am. We only had to significant climbs today but it would be about 2 1/2 miles longer than yesterday. I had some issues getting use to using one trekking pole. My left knee had a little issue late in the day. Today I was more careful and it was ok so far. Jerry's boots are going to barely make it to Great Barrington. We got water out of a faucet at Falls Village and disposed of our trash. There's even a shower head on the side of the building that hikers can use. It's a power plant using a dam on the Housatonic River. We crossed the newly repaired iron bridge over the river and headed up the trail along the cascading falls of the Housatonic. We started up our longest single climb on this trip just shy of 1000 ft. It wasn't the steepest we had over 2 miles to reach Mt Prospect. We took a break at the top and talked to a section hiker going south for a bit. We headed down the mountain into Salsbury where we had lunch on a bench across from a grave yard. I got water from a hose in the middle of the grave yard. Our guide we use tells you about things like faucets and other useful things. These places make it better for the hikers and we truly appreciate all the help we get along the trail. We have to climb up to lions head and down to the shelter to finish the day. This one had some much steeper sections then the first half of the day. We made it tired and ready for dinner. We tent but the shelter had a framed view of the other mountains and valley below. Seven miles of the hike I did last year and I skipped a 14 mile part so would not miss a shuttle and flight home last year. I was ill and cut the trip short. It felt good to get all that dine I missed last year. I really don't hike well alone out hear. 90% if my job I spend alone that may have a little bit to do with it. I'm glad my long time friend Jerry could go with me on this trip. I really enjoy and cherish the times we spend together. He is my longest and dearest friend I have. I don't have a lot of friends but I can count on the ones I do have. Thanks Jerry aka ""Hollywood"". At the shelter we met Wobbles,Daddy Longlegs and his girlfriend. The two are brothers and they started in Harpers Ferry WV. We are tired but we had a beautiful day to hike.","Belters Campsite

Mudflap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535061,Today our miles are shorter but we have three good climbs and some steep downs to do. We had a beautiful sunrise from the shelter this morning. I got a picture while I retrieved our food bags from the bear box. I wake up before sunrise on the trail always. I get plenty of sleep out here for sure. We got packed up and ate our normal granola bar breakfast. Our first climb was going to be Bear mountain. The climb up wasn't as steep up as it was down. We had great weather for it. It can be very slippery when everything is wet. Having only one pole has slowed me down a little on this trip. Hollywood offered to give me one of his but if I was alone I would just have to make the best of it. Here and there he's handed me one on a couple rough ones. We next hiked through Sages Ravine. There's a creek that runs through a ravine with numerous deep swimming holes. On our way to Mt Race we met a ATC Ridge Runner heading to the campsite in Sages Ravine. The climb to Race Mt was a longer climb then Bear Mt was. The top is on a exposed ridge line for over a half mile. Places had sheer cliff drop offs on one side in places. The wind and weather on top of these are so bad that trees are very short to be able to survive. Winter and bad storms wouldn't be pleasant at all for anyone up here. There were many steep sections down from Race Mt. We met a thru hiker named trash slack packing to Jug end rd. Thats a 18 mile day from Salisbury. We took our lunch break at the bottom. Mt Everett was our last climb if the day. It was steep and rocky up to the top. You could see where there was a fire tower on top in the past. Up was much more steeper then the downhill. We tented at Glen Brook shelter for the night. We got in early so we had plenty of time to relax. We set both tents on a raised wood tent platform due to rain was due by early am. On this trip I have tried to contaminate my water three different times by not attaching my filter to the dirty water bag. I do carry Aqua Mira also so I was able to fix it. We had three days of good weather and tomarrow it will rain. We will finish in great Barrington tomarrow. We are looking forward to hot shower.,"Riga Shelter

Mudflap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535101,We had light rain late last night and in th am. The trail down Jug End was slippery and steep in places. The rocks were slippery due to the rain overnight. We both fell multiple times mostly on our asses. Once we got off the mountain the trail was nice through the woods. We worked our way through a marsh and some swampy areas full of Mosquitos atacking us as we moved down the trail. We stopped and took a break at MA 41. We talked to a ATC trail volunteer and a lady who was jogging on the AT. We stopped and took a picture of a Shays Rebellion Monument. We worked our way through more fields and one more climb. We went through one more marsh area over some RXR tracks and to US 7. Before we could even hitch into town a car stopped. Freestyle who thru hiked last year said he thane us to town. He is friend with a hiker I know from 2006. I even gave him a ride home to Harrisburg PA from Maine in 2006. No pliers was his trail name in 06 I hope he contacts me. Freestyle car was full of stuff so Hollywood had to sit on my lap. It felt like a long three mile ride but we made it. We checked into the Days Inn and showered four days of dirt and sweat away. We ate dinner and lunch and relaxed. We will be here one more night before we are shuttled to Hartford to fly out Friday.,"Glen Brook Shelter

Mudflap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535125,Today we did our laundry and relaxed some more. We went to see a movie too and we were the only people in the movie. Tomarrow morning we get a shuttle to a hotel across from the airport in Hartford. Thanks to all the people that made our trip easier. It was great having Hollywood with me on this hike. We had a great time on the trail and in town. It's much more enjoyable to hike with someone. The hike brought a lot of memories of hiking with my friend One Stick. I had several stories for Hollywood about hiking with my friend One Stick. You will never be out of thoughts my friend. Rest in Peace my friend.,,View Entry,"May 25, Wed",0
Mudflap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535130,This hike turned out great. I had a good time hiking with Jerry and I believe he enjoyed it too. Everyone we came in contact with was great. The trail is always challenging out here. We had good weather for hiking trip. This may be the only trip I take this year on the AT. I believe Hollywood wants to go next year. That would be great! Every time I go out I think about what I would not take or what I would bring next time on the hike. See you up the trail.,,View Entry,"May 26, Thu",0
