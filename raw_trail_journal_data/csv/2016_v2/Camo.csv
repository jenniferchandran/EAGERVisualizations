Camo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505958,"This will be my third attempt without even starting. Last two years there have been a couple of family problems that have stopped the hike before it got started. But the third time will be the charm, I hope. I'll be retired in Jan of 16 and I will start on May 1st from highway 19E at Roan Mountain going north then I will come back to there and finish at springer mountain around Nov. 1st.","19E Roan Mountain

My sleeping bag and my tent are to heavy so I've looking to lighten those two items. Been looking at the enlightened equipment quilts, they seem light enough but a very costly. My tent weighs in at 2.10 lbs, I think I can do better. Just throwing a couple thinks out there, any comments sure would be helpful. Thanks Lee","
