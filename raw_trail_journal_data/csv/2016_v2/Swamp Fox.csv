Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520456,"Today's hike was to test my knee. I've had some pain and asked my Dr. about it, he thinks it's overuse and suggested I stay off rough terrain and limit mileage for three weeks, which I have done.I parked on Brooks Road and went up the Sanford Feeder to where it meets the Regicides Trail. I headed North and did a short but steep climb to the junction of Regicides and the Quinnipiac Trail, then retraced my steps and headed South toward New Haven. The hike takes place in the West Rock Ridge State Park, and features fine views of New Haven and a number of ponds and reservoirs.   The knee gave me a twinge or two but soon settled down and I concentrated on enjoying the hike. I've been working on upper body strength. After my attempted thru hike in 2013 I lost a lot of it and haven't got it all back yet. The past few weeks have been good, as I now test average on pushups and situps for a man my age. Another concern has been Vitamin D, which is necessary for strong bones. I've been low, to the point of deficiency, on and off for several years, in spite of taking supplements as directed. So a couple of months ago I bought a narrow band UVB lamp that is supposed to stimulate the skin to create D3. It works, and my last blood test showed it at optimal levels. My Dr. doesn't like the UVB idea, so I'm planning to start sun bathing about 30 minutes a day as soon as the sun gets high enough, that would be mid March at the earliest. In the meantime, supplements should maintain D3 at current levels for a while. I've only changed one item of gear, replacing a fleece with an 850 fill down sweater, very light, but it keeps me warm down to freezing, when combined with a goretex shell or rain jacket.",,"Regicides Trail, New Haven, CT","Jan 30, Sat",4
Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520633,"Yesterday I did 7.3 miles on the Regicides Trail in Hamden/New Haven, CT, then today I did 4 miles in the Tyler Mill Preserve in Wallingford. It was unseasonably warm, and I had to take off my hat and gloves, and unzip my jacket, to stay cool. I could have hiked in shirt sleeves. The photo was taken in early January on the AT near Bulls Bridge in Kent, CT. That was the first section of trail I did, back in 2012. I hiked South alongside the Housatonic River, crossed the Ten Mile River on a steel footbridge, and continued to the summit of Ten Mile Hill. I also took a side trail to an overlook, in pictures, the Housatonic River. It's a very pleasant stretch of trail, running beside the river for a while, under the tall pines, walking on a cushion of pine needles. The climb up the hill is short, but steep, with a stone stairway in one place that somebody did a lot of work on. I met a number of local hikers, friendly and talkative, enjoying their hikes.I also checked out the Shelter, which is in a nice location, on a field with a water pump and some derelict farm machinery. I went up there because I was sort of wondering, how important is this hike to me, do I need to do the whole thing, etc. After revisiting my first experience of the trail, I'm just as eager as I was when I first started planning and getting in shape. I enjoy the whole experience: walking in the woods, climbing mountains, the shelters, the hikers, trail angels and trail magic, the off beat hostels... Although I have the luxury of not being on a schedule, I still have a tendency to pass up anything that requires going on a side trail, just too focused on making my mileage for the day. Also, I've missed some of the best hostels and places to stay, by not being well informed. That's part of the experience, and for this year I'll be more careful to pick up information on the hostels, B&Bs, and places to visit before I do each section.",,Staying In Shape,"Feb 02, Tue",0
Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520700,"Today I did about 8 miles on the Regicides Trail in Hamden/New Haven, CT. The main point of interest is Judge's Cave, where Edward Whalley and his son-in-law William Goffe hid from officers of the Crown after the Restoration in 1661. They had signed the death warrant of King Charles, and were forced to flee to America after the monarchy was restored. The cave is really just a heap of boulders (in photos). There is a plaque with a short history of their stay, and the words ""Disobedience to tyrants is obedience to God.""There were some wonderful views, to include Sleeping Giant, a mountain in Hamden, named for its profile, which it resembles. The trail has some rough sections, jumbles of trap rock with constant small ups and downs. I got tired, and just when I thought I had reached my turnaround point, I discovered that the lake I was using to track my progress was the wrong one. So I had another mile to go. I've had similar experiences on the AT, using gaps to track progress, and then I discover I missed one and still have another mountain to climb. I'm planning to start hiking North in Pennsylvania, as soon as I see some weather reports that call for temperatures no lower than freezing at night. I'm not going to be doing a lot of conditioning, on the grounds that the parts of PA that come up next involve walking through fields, not too difficult, and I can get in shape doing that. So while I wait for the weather to warm up, I'll be doing relatively short hikes locally, just for enjoyment.",,More Staying in Shape,"Feb 04, Thu",0
Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522649,"I've been watching the weather reports and battling cabin fever. While I have gear that is good below freezing, I've been waiting for a window where I could go down to PA and pick up where I left off last year, without dealing with too much cold temperatures. The plan is, leaving early Monday (tomorrow) I drive @ 400 miles down to PA and park in the parking lot on Rte 34. I pick up a sandwich (for supper) at the Green Mountain Deli and take a shuttle to Boiling Springs. From there I do a few miles to the Alec Kennedy shelter, and the next day I hike back to my car. From there, I drive to Duncannon and have dinner at the Doyle. Leaving the car in the parking lot by the railroad station, Mike Gelinas picks me up and brings me back to the Gelinas B&B in Boiling Springs for the night. Then I head out the next day, going North to Duncannon. This particular section of trail is flat as a pancake, but I haven't done any real miles all winter, so the schedule is flexible. There aren't many places to stay, hiking through farmland, so at Rte 11 I make a decision, to go to a motel or continue on to the next shelter. I complete the hike in Duncannon and head for home.Not at all ambitious for mileage. But as a section hiker, I lose what little trail legs I have over the winter, and last year, for example, my first outing included the roller coaster, which was a struggle. So I plan something not too difficult, and flexible on the daily mileage.",,Heading for PA ,"Mar 06, Sun",0
Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523016,"After driving down from CT, I parked in the lot at route 34 and Michael Gelinas shuttled me to Boiling Springs. The trail headed South on a fieldwalk, then turned into the woods where I was greeted by a chorus of frogs in a vernal pool. From there it was a gradual uphill to Center Point Knob elev. 1,060.It was a short day due to the long drive to the starting point. The shelter is small but clean. The AWOL book mentions an unreliable spring. I asked a few locals at the parking lot and they said there would be water there so I carried only enough to drink while hiking on an unseasonably hot day. The spring was MIA, but following the sign and blue blazes I reached a stream flowing strong and clear.I had the shelter to myself and after eating a sub I carried up from the Green Mountain Deli on Rte 34, I turned in early and slept soundly.","Boiling Springs

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523028,"Headed out after a breakfast of oatmeal. Soon two deer appeared, running across the ridge as I was climbing up. At first I thought they were mountain bikers, but then the white tails showed up.The main feature of the day was two rock mazes, per AWOL, or Rock City, as some call it locally, Rocky Ridge per others. The trail runs along the spine of the ridge. The rocks are slanted and jumbled together and is is slow going, at least for this old (not bold) hiker. A fair number of empty beverage containers dropped into nooks and crannies, not too far from the road.Just when I was beginning to wonder why it was taking so long, I met a young man with bad teeth and questionable gear, who informed me it was less than a mile from the parking lot. From the lot I drove to Duncannon, where I had dinner at the Doyle. Pat and Vicky very kindly permitted me to leave the car behind the hotel. Michael shuttled me back to the Gelinas Manor in Boiling Springs, where I would spend the night before hiking North back to my car.After a lukewarm (Dr's orders) shower I turned in early and slept well.","Alec Kennedy Shelter

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523056,"Breakfast was served at 8:30. There is a dam and pond across the street from the B&B, so I strolled around a bit. Very pleasant old section of town, and the Trail runs beside the pond and past the ATC Center before heading out across the fields. Breakfast was well worth waiting for. Boiling Springs, like earlier stops on the AT in PA, had an iron industry with the rypical furnace. There was underground railroad activity: in 1847 Daniel Kaufman, a town founder, was fined $2,000 for harboring fugitive slaves. The verdict was reversed as it was a Federal statute and the state court had no jurisdiction. Not to be deterred, his neighbors sued again, and he was fined $2,800 plus costs of $1,200. These were ruinous sums at the time. Abolitionist societies and concerned individuals paid part of it for him.The hike was bucolic, a fieldwalk in many places, and never far from the sights, sounds and smells of agriculture. Some of the farmland is owned by the ATC, still used for farming, to include the usual pesticides. Hikers are advised to keep themselves and their pets on the trail.Met and enjoyed a nice conversation with Cash, a retired woman who did her hike in the 1980's. Cash stands for candy ass section hiker. I also met a young woman with two toddlers. She had what I thought was a large pack, but it was an infant carrier. She had a front sling for the other. So she lets them hike until they're tired, then carries them.The Days Inn is a quarter mile down Rte 11, and next to a 24 hour diner. You cross the highway on a footbridge and there are sidetrails down to the road. The shoulder is wide and you can walk through parking lots part of the way. Management appreciates what hikers are doing and gives a discount, very reasonable.","Boiling Springs
",Rte 11,"Mar 09, Wed",8
Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523298,"I left the Days Inn with just a candy bar for breakfast. The night before, I went back to the diner and had three scoops of ice cream, so not too hungry. The first part of the day was on level ground and at times along the the Conodoguinet Creek, pleasant to walk by the water. Scott Farms had a sign for water, but the spigot didn't yield anything. There was a lot of work done to deal with the trail through relatively civilized areas, to include bridges and tunnels over roads. Plank walks and erosion control, etc. Soon enough the trail turned uphill, switch-backed extensively but still steep. There was an old car, and nearby the spring that is the last reliable water source before Darlington Shelter. I carried two liters up, although I correctly surmised that the spring at the shelter would be flowing this early in the year. There was a semicircular stone staircase around a formation, as well as a sizable stone couch (in photos). The trail runs sidehill/uphill on a steep slope, with quite a bit of dry masonry support. The spring at Darlington was running, and a maintainer from the Mountain Club of Maryland was there working on the composting (not moldering) privy, a Taj Mahal as AWOL observes. I met three trail runners who are members of a drinking club with a running problem, J. Edgar Boozer, Deathwish, and I forget the third. They cracked a few beers and we talked for a while. It's a good life if you don't weaken. The shelter was small and cozy, and I slept warm.","Rte 11
",Darlington Shelter,"Mar 10, Thu",6.30
Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523356,"It was an easy day, down off one mountain, across a valley, and up another mountain. I passed a trough in the woods. It's no longer used, but it was full of water and frogs, singing loudly and enjoying themselves. I got to the shelter in time for a late lunch and a sunbath. There is a porcupine problem there: the little critters have been gnawing anything where hiker sweat accumulates. The solution was (in photos) to remove the front stairs and install flashing so as to make it too slippery for the porcupines to climb up. I'm none too limber and finally decided the easiest way to get into the shelter was to stand on a rock, sit on the floor, spin around and stand up. Tom the Pressure Washer, on a hike with his 14 year old son, stopped by on his way to spend the night at Hawk Rock. We talked about the Doyle, which is on GoFundMe and at the time had $6,600 of $10,000 raised. There is a lot of tradition and memory around the Doyle and I'm glad something is being done to keep it operating. The spring is a steep 0.1 mile down, and was flowing nicely. I had to make two trips, one for my evening meal and one for breakfast and coffee in the morning. An extra container, perhaps another liter, would have come in handy. The shelter is post and beam construction, including some very old materials, and rough sawn where not hand worked. Between that and the efforts of the porcupines, it's distinctive. It's heavily used as it was littered with trash, a good part of which I carried down off the mountain, since it was not far and I had lightened my pack by eating all the food. I left the eggshells.","Darlington Shelter
",Cove Mountain Shelter,"Mar 11, Fri",7.30
Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523372,"It was a cold morning and I took my time getting breakfast and packing up. Heading for Duncannon, I met a scoutmaster whose son was going to go from cub scouts to boy scouts this year. So he was out checking the trail and planning to take a group out hiking. We talked about various sections of trail, I think maybe starting at Caledonia State Park and going north conditions are woodsy and pleasant, but not difficult. Kids today have every opportunity to turn into couch potatoes, just sitting there playing games on their devices, lost in an artificial reality that stunts their growth and saps their strength. It's a good idea to get them out in the woods, but you need to be careful not to make it too demanding all at once. Above Hawk Rock there's a camp site, occupied last night by Tom the Power Washer and his son, and the remains of their fire still smoldering in the ring. Down from there was Hawk Rock, where I met a young man with a bowie knife on his belt, and a tomahawk on the rock in front of him, dressed partially in camo. I met a similar individual down by Watauga Lake in 2013, armed with a bowie knife, camping where bears are frequently a source of trouble for hikers. I mentioned to this year's version that my wife is scared that bears will get me, but in 1,400 miles of trail I have yet to encounter the ursine menace. I don't own a gun, and when hiking carry a mini Swiss Army knife, very small but I can cut para cord or whittle a bit, trim my nails and my nose hair, tend to my toes, and other important stuff. No need for a machete, bowie knife, or tomahawk. The trail is steep but generously stair-stepped and dangerous only to the unwary. The Doyle was not yet open, but I left a note thanking Pat and Vicki and mentioned a donation, since made, to the Doyle Hotel account on GoFundMe. I was home in time for supper, very nice roast beef, broccoli, baked potato, and salad. The section went well, lovely weather, a fair number of interesting people to talk to, and good hospitality at the B&B and motel I used. I could have done it more quickly, but stayed with the short miles to get back in shape slowly rather than risk injury overdoing it after slowing down during the winter. I plan to go back out soon, another section NoBo in PA.","Cove Mountain Shelter

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524033,"This is the first day of a multi day section. I drove from CT to PA Rte 325 where the trail crosses and there is a good parking lot. Joyce Carlin shuttled me to Duncannon so I could continue my hike from where I left off a few days ago.The trail goes through Duncannon on sidewalks, then crosses the Juniata and Susquehannah Rivers by means of bridges, both of which have provisions for pedestrians. Then across the tracks and steeply up to the ridge. There were good views of the river from both sides. It rained a little, enough for me to put on my rain gear. I hiked alngside a local hiker who was doing photography. When it was time for him to head back down, he very kindly (and with permission) said a prayer for me, asking for strength and stamina, both of which I could use. Last year I was saved by a voice from the light, this year I get prayers before I get in trouble.I was the only person at the shelter. The spring is piped, and I filtered about 5 liters so as to only make one trip. I brought along a large collapsible container for the purpose. I turned in early and slept a little cold.","Duncannon

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524052,"It was sunny, cold in the wind and warm otherwise. The main scenic attraction was Table Rock (in photos). It was warm enough that when I got to Table Rock I was able to take a sunbath. On the side of the ridge away from the wind, and with the rocks heated by the sun, it was comfortable without a shirt.The shelter is large, two stories, with bear boxes and a composting privy. It was windy and cold. The sign says 300 steps down to the spring, while an entry in the journal claims to have counted 525. It's steep. I carried up 6 liters, so as to be sure to only do it once.Cold Front and Axon stopped by and we chatted for a while. They're teachers and were hiking on spring break. They've done everything south of where I met them and plan to complete this summer.So suddenly I noticed a bump on my thigh, which turned out to be a tick. Bummer, active in winter. I pulled it off with tweezers and made a note of the date.Slept cold, the wind was strong and swirled around the shelter.","Clarks Ferry Shelter

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524114,"Kinter View was not that impressive but served as a landmark. This stretch was rough and rocky, crossing back and forth over the spine of the ridge, or sometimes along the crest. The bedrock is slanted 30 to 60 degrees. I went slowly, to avoid beating up my feet.Four trail bikers zoomed past, coming from behind with no warning. Two elderly gents without packs were studying the landscape. A person in black passed me, carrying a pack and poles, but didn't slow down to make conversation. I reached the car in time for lunch at the nearest pizza parlor. I called Jeanne to tell her Iwas on my way, but she said check the weathet, the storm went out to sea. The weather changed, so there was a change in me: I decided to continue the hike.I had a coupon for the EconoLodge in Pine Grove, and stayed the night.

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524416,"The day started with a longish climb, mostly on old road and graded very lenient. After passing the Horse Shoe Trail there were the remains of an old fire tower and the foundation of a small building. At Rattling Run I stopped to get water and carried out two liters, since there would not be a good source where I planned to camp. At that point the trail runs through mixed rhododendron and mountain laurel, with lots of checkerberry. I like the smell when you crush the leaves, wintergreen. Very peaceful and serene. I stopped for some conversation with a father/son team: the son is doing 170 miles south to Harpers Ferry and the father was hiking with him for the first 3 days. At Yellow Springs there were about 40 Korean hikers, a club from the Philadelphia area. They were enjoying a day hike/tour. I took the short day because I planned to go 0.7 miles to the Yellow Springs Village site, as listed in the AWOL book. What I found was a tower (see photo), used to house apparatus to pump air into the mine. I talked to some day hikers and accidentally yogied two bottles of water, much needed and appreciated. Also a big hole, which I did not go down into. Back at the campsite, I found an old well, (in photos), with some branches to warn the unwary. It appears that the campsite is where the village was, but the foundations have been removed. There were four piles of rocks just a little north of where I stayed, perhaps what's left of the foundations. It got down below freezing at night, and I kept my water filter in the bag with me. I wore a cap to sleep in, to avoid closing the bag so near to my mouth that my breath condenses around the opening. I don't like that when it happens, cold and clammy. Slept a little cold.","Rte 325

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524452,"The trail to Rausch Gap was easy and I made good time. It's pleasant there, hemlocks and rushing water.At one time there was a miner's village there, with about 1,000 residents, supported by a coal mine and railroad maintenance work. The mine failed, the RR moved, and the town disappeared, leaving foundations and a small cemetery. I didn't stop to look at things, but here's a link to a nice blog that covers it: http://stuofdoom.com/main/?p=1889When I crossed the stream on the bridge, I noticed what looked like industrial effluent but turned out to be diversion wells. This is a method of running the water over limestone to reduce excessive acidity. The water is too acid to support trout otherwise. I had planned to camp shortly before Rte 443, but made good time and reached the road by early afternoon. Joyce Carlin was able to give me a quick shuttle back to my car on short notice, and I was soon on the way home. The section went well, other than it was a little cold at night. Parking my car at a midpoint, I was able to resupply from it and use it to take a break by going to a motel and eating real food one night. I'm getting back in shape fairly rapidly and plan to do something longer when I continue northward in PA, probably early April.","Yellow Springs Campsite

Slight problem, I had forgotten my hiking shoes. Cabela's is two or three miles away in Hamburg, so he drove me there and waited while I bought some shoes. Then he shuttled me to where I left off, and I headed North. The Carlins run an excellent shuttle service, friendly to hikers and very familar with the area.The Iron Bridge has been relocated but the trail still goes across it. There was a view at an abandoned powerline.I didn't make very good time and started late. I hiked in by headlamp, ate a P&J for supper, and turned in early. The GPS in my car took me over the GW Bridge during rush hour, so I spent a lotof time in traffic before I got to the trail.On the plus side, I avoided a motel bill and got in a full day's hiking.","Rte 443

Oppie has done everything North of Delaware Water Gap, and intends to head Souh to continue his hike. I've done GA, NC, most of TN and half of VA, so we talked about what he could expect. Also about the 100 Mile Wilderness, which he did in August with light/minimal gear. That could be the way to go.At the Showers Steps Overlook I was tired enough to quit for the day, but the AWOL guide confused me and there are 500 steps. No information on how far to water. At Peters Mountain I did 300 steps to fetch water, this steps stuff scares me. I hiked on.The Hertline Campsite is right beside a stream, and I took a site with water on either side. Going further I would have had the use of a tent pad, level and smooth. Somebody had left a bottle of whiskey in a bracket that could have been intended for a register or some brochures.It was windy but not cold, and the predicted rain did not happen.

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526023,"At this point the trail became rough and rocky, with a steady decrease in the occasional smooth sections and an increase in the size of the rocks. My feet developed blisters, the combination of new shoes and bad tread was too much. I tried moleskin but found it hard to apply according to directions. You have to align the hole with the blister, then apply dressing. So I lanced the worst of them (with a needle from the emergency sewing kit), applied alcohol preps, and used regular bandages.I had some light socks for use with camp shoes and put one on as a sock liner. The constant pressure from placing the feet on yhe rocky surface had a lot to do with the problem. I've done over 1,400 miles of the trail and these are my first blisters.I passed the Fort Dietrich Snyder and Rentschler monumunts, stopping at the former to rest and take a short side trail for water. Somebody had thrown some boots onto a tree, the sole had ripped off. I had the shelter to myself. The water source is good, but the composting privy was very nearly full.","Hertline Campsite

Bandages and ointment for my blisters, plus a loaf of bread from which I took eight slices. Everything else was from the car.Lunch was a huge and delicious bacon cheeseburger at the Port Clinton Hotel. I packed the leftovers out for supper.Lance Carlin shuttled me to the starting point and from there it was an easy hike up to the shelter.

Three yong men came down off the ridge where they had camped and experienced high winds. Under windy conditions, being up on the ridge or on the wrong side of it can be brutal.The trail runs east and west at this point, along the ridge, and for several hours I was below the ridge and to the south of it, very comfortable. Then I got up into the wind, which was gusting as high as 40 mph.I stopped to take a break in a sheltered spot. A trail runner came by, lightly clad and sweating profusely. He was participating in a running event and was off the course and lost. I let him use my phone, and he calmed down and stopped cussing after the organizers gave him directions. Something about a radio tower and a power line.Arriving at the powerline near Ashfield Road, I met an elderly day hiker taking a lunch break and enjoying the warmth of the sun on the rocks. I joined him and he gave me a delicious cookie, not too sweet, with raisons or currants. We struck up a conversation and hiked together until he left me at the shelter. The shelter is small and old, built with a little slant from front to back. It's in a hollow down out of the wind. There are several springs, none of them reliable. Number one was bone dry. Number two was a shallow trickle. I scraped up a liter and left it at that. I had carried in two liters, since the AWOL book cautions hikers on the unreliable water source.

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526439,"Thanks Dennis and Tina, and Iceman, for your concern and offers of assistance if needed. Between the weather and the terrain it's been a couple of very tough days. Thanks àlso to those who have given me gifts of food, water and encouragement.It got down below freezing during the night, and I woke up to find a small amount of snow. After Bake Oven Knob, the trail became an obstacle course. At one point it runs along the top of a ridge, with rocks at angles and many places requiring the use of the hands. The rocks were wet and slick. I fell twice but fortunately no injuries. It took me four hours to do the four miles to Route 309. On the way I met a young man who was doing about thirty miles in one day, ending at the Lehigh River. He told me I will have more of the same before I reach Eckville Shelter. He had taken a fall due to the snow and ice, a little bit scraped up, but hiked rapidly across the boulder strewn trail. At 309 I checked the weather and decided to continue. The scenario called for the rain to let up late afternoon, so I thought I could get to the shelter relatively dry with time to set up for a very cold evening. There's a reliable spring just before the shelter, so I hiked with half a liter and then treated and carried up two liters from the spring. The shelter is a good one, clean and neat, a good spring, and a privy. I hung my tent as a curtain from the upper bunk, in an effort to keep the wind out.

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526637,"It was well below freezing when I got up. The water was partially frozen, and had to be melted before I could have a cup of coffee. Boots, socks and gloves were frozen. I dressed warmly and headed out without breakfast. It would be a sunny day and as it got warmer I could get water at the next spring and have breakfast there, etc. Trail Angel Dennis had offered to give me a lift to Port Clinton (where my car was parked) if conditions got too difficult. Checking the weather report, temperatures were projected to be below freezing yet once more. So I emailed him and we arranged for him to pick me up at a parking area that can be reached by a 0.4 mile side trail just before Eckville Shelter. Another difficulty, my phone didn't have much charge left, and the two chargers I carry wouldn't work. I put them and the phone in pockets close to my body, in the hope that they would work when heated sufficiently. I tried again after a couple of hours, no luck, and figured the chargers were defective. I don't carry a paper copy of the AWOL book, and hike alone, so it became important to conserve what little charge I had. It warmed up, and I hiked down a steep side trail to Dan's Spring, which was piped and flowing freely. I treated two liters and sat there in the sun eating breakfast.After negotiating a couple of boulder fields, I arrived at Dan's Pulpit, which has an outstanding view. No photo, charge too low. I sat there in the sun, savoring the view, and had lunch. I fell asleep at the switch and hiked past the side trail to the parking lost, across Hawk Mountain Road, and upward and onward. About 3:15 I checked the AWOL pdf and discovered my error. I got a surge of adrenaline (frustration and anger at my own stupidity) and charged back to the road. Arriving there, it became clear I wasn't going to reach the parking lot on time, so I emailed Dennis with my whereabouts and asked him to pick me up at the road. It's hard to use a phone on the last few %, the screen goes dim. While waiting for an answer, I tried the chargers one last time and they worked. Dennis turned up shortly and drove me back to Port Clinton. As it turned out, he and Tina had been trying to warn me that I might be underestimating the weather, and I was. Cold weather hiking, even if you dress warmly, uses a lot of calories, which trail food doesn't replace. The wind and rain suck the heat right out of you. I admire the strength and stamina of those who start at Springer early in the year, and deal with these kinds of conditions for weeks at a time. But not for me.Add the phone and chargers to the list of stuff to keep from freezing. I got about two bonus miles, due to hiking past the pickup point and returning. On the way home, I stopped at McDonald's and ate something greasy with lots of calories. Once home, I took a shower and hopped on the scale. I had lost 7 pounds. Then I curled up in bed, under a nice warm duvet.   ","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527947,"Since the section in PA was disrupted by the weather, I've been home, healing my blisters and waiting for conditions to improve. Now we are getting some spring weather and I'm planning to go back to PA on Sunday and pick up where I left off.I went to REI and picked up a new Sawyer Squeeze filter, out of concern that I left my pack in the car after hiking in March and may have frozen it. Also some Permethrin, which I will probably use at some point. The warnings on the package are not reassuring, but I've had two rounds of antibiotics after being bitten by deer ticks, getting the bulls eye rash, etc, and don't want to go through that again.Pennsylvania isn't that good for water. There were a number of situations where it was a long way down to get it, and that influenced hydration. I have a ten liter collapsible container, which helped when I brought it, but it leaks around the outlet valve and doesn't pack as tight as I would like. So now I'm trying a one liter water bag, in addition to the Nalgene and soda bottle I've been using. That way, I can carry three liters, four if you count the Sawyer bag, and avoid repetitious trips to the spring. I had hiked over 1,400 miles without a blister, before coming down with them on my last section. Partly it was new shoes, but the rocks contributed. Stepping on rocks that are at all different angles, the foot is moved around a lot and rubs more than it would on level ground with good tread. I will start using sock liners again, and hike in my old shoes.The experiment with hiking earlier in the year was a partial success. There weren't a lot of bugs, there were some days with idyllic weather, and I got a good start on the 450 miles I plan on doing this year. 5 or 10 day weather projections are subject to change, and it can be quite a bit colder and windier in the mountains than it is at the gaps or down there on the farmland. After thinking about it for a while, I plan to stay with my original idea, which was to avoid hiking when night time temperatures are likely to be below freezing. Maybe there needs to be some consideration of wind, or wind chill, given most of the AT runs along ridges.   ","Wallingford, CT

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528804,"Today's hike was a slack-pack, due to the steep and rocky climb and in the interest of getting a little more miles. The climb up from Lehigh Gap starts out easy, but soon gets steep. There were a number of places where I passed my poles up and used my hands. The climb got my attention but there was nothing that was dangerous except to the unwary. Unless you get a ""Ned the Fed"" moment. He was completing a through hike on Katahdin, grabbed a handhold on a rock that everybody had been using for years, and it came loose on him and injured his shoulder. They took him off in a helicopter. I studied my handholds. After that the trail has been rerouted onto a green and grassy road that runs along the ridge. You can look down on the Zinc Smelter that made the mess that is now the Super Fund area. After much work, the area is beginning to get some vegetation, to include pitch pines, birch and aspens. The road eventually gave way to some wooden stars that took me back up on to the rough and rocky ridge walk. I was on the side that gets the wind, and eventually took a break in a pitch pine grove that looked like a hunters campsite. Someone had brought up a backsaw and used it to shave bark off the trees and saw up some birch for a fire. From there it turned in to a long slog across assorted types of rocky terrain, everything from little pointy stones to good size size boulders. At Delps Spring I called John Stempa to tell him I was on the way, and again from Stempa Spring which he discovered and piped. He met me at Smith Gap. Once back at the house, I took a shower and went to the Kunkletown Pub for a good size hamburger and salad, very tasty and good service.

It's a one mile drive to where he put me back on the trail, headed North. There is one vista, at Hahn's Lookout, you get a view of the highway and surrounding civilization. The rocks eased up a bit for the first mile or so, then it was pretty steady until Wind Gap. I was done a little after noon, and John took me back to his house where I will once again sleep on the garage floor. He has an old Martin trail guitar: we dusted it off and tuned it up and I played a few songs. John Jr. is a rock enthusiast, plays both guitar and drums. We tried a couple of songs together, good results on ""Call Me the Breeze,"" not so good on ""Don't This Road Look Rough and Rocky."" He's not into country, doesn't dig it at all.I drove back to Wind Gap for supper at Detzi's. It's a good restaurant, not that far from the trailhead. Basic fare, good size servings.

He had an external frame pack. He told me there was no water at the shelter. I told him about my cache. The next hiker was an Australian, also SoBo, with a front and back pack. It balances the weight. Next were father and son hikers Bob and Reese, out for 25 miles.At the Wolf Rocks Bypass I drew and treated a liter of water. The spring was bubbling mysteriously and there were leaves and green scum on the water.Not to worry, filter and UV should handle it OK. At Fox Gap there was a man my age putting up signs, no fires as the woods are dry as tinder. There have been many fires near the trail recently, in the news.

",Kirkridge Shelter,"Apr 21, Thu",10
Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529399,"I woke up a little after midnight to take a leak, then the trouble started. A disoriented young man in a hoodie, with a small pack, wandered in, talking to himself. I was able to engage him in conversation, and learned that he had hiked across the river to see what it was like on the other side. He hung around mumbling for a while then wandered off. Then two young men dressed in tee shirts wandered in, and inquired of me, who might I be? I informed them, and they said ""Oh a hiker on the AT"" and walked off. Then a night hiker passed by, hiking by headlamp. Then the noise started. Kirkridge Shelter is located 0.1 miles from a Retreat Center, and has access to water only from that source. There was some kind of loud party going on, with music I couldn't understand, howling like wolves at the moon, chanting, so on and so forth. I figured oh well by 2:00 am the party will be over, they'll talk a few minutes in the parking lot then head for home. But it got louder and louder, and by 3:00 am I was beginning to wonder what was going in. Being a deep thinker, I figured they are howling at the moon, maybe it's a full moon. Checking online, lo and behold, it was a full moon, which could be verified by looking up, where the moon shone dimly through the clouds. The party was going to go on until the moon set. Finally I got disgusted, packed up my stuff, and headed out by the light of the silvery moon. Then I got the impression the howling and chanting was following me. I didn't care for that, turned off my headlamp, and quickened my pace across the jagged terrain. As I learned later in the day, there is a place called Columcille Megalithic Park, nearby, and popular with those who take an interest in Celtic culture and enjoy the serenity of the groves. Also popular with those who delight in howling at the moon. Apparently the party kind of spilled over between the two locations. Reaching Tott's Gap, the noise receded (finally) and I stopped for an early breakfast sitting on Tott's foundation. I had coffee and junk food, waited until it got bright enough to hike without the headlamp, and continued the hike. Soon I was walking east on a green and grassy road, into the rising sun,a bright new day, listening to the birds in their morning chorus. The wild turkeys joined in: contrary to popular culture, they do not gobble at the moon, but instead they join their fellow avians, singing as the sun rises. The views were outstanding, but my phone camera couldn't do them justice. Soon the trail headed down through rhododendrons, and I called John Stempa and gave him an ETA to meet me in front of the Deer Head Inn. I met a woman out walking her dog and she informed me about Columcille. Soon I was in town, and sat on the porch of the Inn until John arrived. He made me walk to the beginning of the bridge, in the interest of doing the entire trail. Then I remembered, I already did that, I parked farther away when I started on NJ by parking at DWG and hiking across the bridge. That was last year, or maybe the year before. Soon I was in the car and headed for home. Hiking the AT NoBo in PA may be likened to a bad relationship. In the early going, everything is fine, easy going, mile after mile of lenient grades and good tread. Then the trouble starts, rocks occasionally erupt in front of you, but after picking your way across, the easy going continues. Gradually the rocks come to predominate, until finally that's all you get. Soon enough you are clawing your way up out of Lehigh Gap and walking across the devastation of Smaug, a near lunar landscape. Of course every relationship has its ups and downs. The night at Kirkridge Shelter was like the grand finale, in divorce court. And the morning after, hiking along the greensward toward the rising sun, was like walking out of court, free at last. My feet will recover, and forgive me. Now just to be clear, I have been married for 48 years, and the above simile should not be interpreted as being in any way autobiographical in nature. Nor is it about any particular person I know. It's just kind of a summary of observations I've made over the years.","Kirkridge Shelter

Rather than attempt to perform in the new style, he found new places to perform: colleges, folk festivals, and TV.

He takes the car to the destination and then hikes back to meet her. They camp in the state forests where there is access to flush toilets, showers, and clean water. During the hike I met Maine and Say Hi again. Maine was resting his pack on a convenient rock of the right height, and I informed him that he was crumping. That's what the croo at the Huts in New Hampshire call it. He didn't seem too impressed that there is a word for it. At Old Rich Valley Road LumberMack was doing trail magic. I enjoyed a soda and then he gave several of us a ride to the Quarter Way Inn Hostel, which is 0.8 miles. Once there, it was very pleasant and clean, with comfortable bunks that sported real mattresses not foam junk.

It is an amazing gravel road, about 9 miles of twisting and turning, very tight and not much room if a car is coming from the other direction. Cade and Reboot did the 20 miles south as a slack pack in one day, it took me two with a pack. I met numerous hikers, to include Timone and Puma, Lady McGyver, Bear Chaser, Mix and Duchess. It was a longish climb up to Chestnut Knob Shelter, which was unbearably hot. I continued down the hill, a pleasant meadow walk, and into the woods again. I took what turned out to be the last campsite for several miles.The spring at Walker's Gap was a little bit off trail, but was boxed and piped. It must have been done long ago to accommodate watering animals along the road. Rock Steady and Breeze joined me later. They're about my age and we all turned in early.

I hiked along about as fast as I could go but arrived too late. It ended the way many have lately in VA, a pleasant ramble through meadows down to the road. It's picturesque and bucolic, numerous Black Angus munching on grass, which will eventually make them suitable for conversion to steak, hamburger, etc. Chunky had to do a last minute shuttle to take Roc Steady and the Breeze off at 623. Roc was having foot problems and need to get some orthotics. So dinner was late but good, mac and cheese and a delicious mixture made with wild rice.

Michelangelo, Jog Walker and I drove my car up to 623 and headed North, after exchanging telephone numbers. The plan was for Jog Walker who is faster than me to hike to the end, get a shuttle back to the car, and drive it back to VA 52 where the hike would end. Brandon elected to quit in the middle and texted to that effect. Of course service is off and on in the area. Miscommunication and miscalculation ensued and Jog Walker hiked back and met me at VA 615, where the trail crosses Laurel Creek. She backtracked 3 miles. Meanwhile Michelangelo and taken a shuttle with Bubba and left the trail. His feet hurt. After some discussion and gifts of food and beverage from fellow hikers, Jog and I continued the original plan but stayed together. It was the longest distance I have hiked since I was a young man, but the terrain was relatively easy, much of it along old logging roads that had very gentle grades and good tread. By the time Bubba got us back to the car and we drove into Pearisburg, it was getting late so we booked into the hostel at the Holiday Inn and went out for Mexican Food across the street without the usual shower.

It started giving out messages to the effect that moisture was detected every time I connected a charger cable. I spent hours on the phone with the place I bought it and Verizon itself and was directed to various service locations, the nearest of which didn't exist. Finally it became apparent that the best solution would be to drive back to Marion, VA where I bought it and return it within the 14 day no questions return period. So I drove back to Marion and went to the store. At this point, they revealed that the phone only takes a charge from the proprietary cable included with the original purchase. I was incredulous: and spent several hours hanging around the store while it charged from various sources using the included cable.So Samsung doesn't tell you about the cable, nor does the phone give you an appropriate error message when another cable is used. The people at the store knew this, but didn't tell me at the point of sale, nor over the phone when I called. Finally it came out when I got to the point of returning the product. I like the phone, and decided to keep it. Prior to leaving Pearisburg to return the phone in Marion, I decided to end the section, and moved out of a room I was sharing with Jog Walker, leaving her a note to that effect. We had been planning to slack pack from Bland to Pearisburg over three days, hiking in opposite directions and passing the car key when we would meet in the middle. She reacted with some bitterness, and harsh words were exchanged over the phone. Meanwhile an insect bite on my left leg blistered and kept growing. I lanced it, cleaned it with an alcohol prep, and applied antibiotic ointment. I used an ATM at the National Bank in Pearisburg, and apparently left my card in the machine. I discoverd that when I went to book a motel room on the way home. So I paid cash and informed the bank of the lost or stolen card. The drive back home is a long one, and traffic was heavy. All the tentsites at Caledonia State Park (in PA) were booked, and several motels I checked at were also completely booked. So I drove home in one day instead of two. It's good to be back home again.Hopping on the scale, I lost 12 pounds while hiking over the past month, in spite of eating quite a bit of real food in town and carrying more snacks etc while on the trail. Apparently I can't digest calories as fast as I burn them while hiking. With that in mind, future expeditions will be held to two weeks or less. Although the Virginia hike ended on several sour notes, I was singing the Shenandoah Waltz (or playing the music in my head) while driving home. It's a beautiful state, very pleasant hiking in the spring, steep mountains, tall trees, colorful flowers, lush meadows, and so on and so forth. I'll be back.What I have left to complete the trail is 206 miles in VA and 319 from Pinkham Notch in NH to Katahdin. Later this year I'll head North with the idea of doing about 100 miles. If I'm feeling strong I'll do Katahdin. I had hoped to save it for last but I'm not getting any younger. Then in the Fall back to VA and another 100.   ","Pearisburg

The night before I stayed at the White Mountains Lodge and Hostel and took the shuttle to Pinkham Notch in the morning.Guardian and Bill Nye had just completed through hikes, celebration and congratulations were in order. Princess and Rocketman had just been rescued from a brush with hypothermia, so there was lively conversation. They were slackpacking, and the weather turned ugly, horizontal sleet and high winds. Visibility became an issue and they couldn't see the next cairn to follow the trail. Wolfman came along, set them up in his tent and called 911. Meanwhile they were carrying a Delorme and sent an alarm. Help arrived in due course. They were physically OK but as experienced hikers who have done the trail several times they were somewhat embarrassed. The weather in the Whites is unpredictable.Fred (Frantic Oreo) and I went out for supper at the Dynasty Buffett. It's AYCE, popular with hikers. He's a little older than me, an experienced ultra marathoner and a fast hiker. He also had some experiences in the stock market that were similar to mine, amusing in retrospect.   The morning shuttle (included with the stay) left for Pinkham Notch at 7:30, after a hearty breakfast. The first mile along Lost Pond Trail was easy, then the AT heads up on Wildcat Ridge Trail. The climb is steep and requires the use of the hands in places, enough that I stowed the poles for a while. It reminded me of Moosilauke, with occasional drill marks from blasting to make the trail, and wood steps fastened to the rock in places.The wind was gusting up to about 60 mph and at one point blew me off course by several feet. The pack creates a large area for the wind to work on, not to mention it's heavy on steep terrain. At the point where wood blocks create a trail across steep, bare rock, I became apprehensive that an ill-timed gust of wind would blow me off balance. Unlike Moosilauke, there was no rebar handrail. I went up it OK. There are a number of ledges with fine views, as well as a wooden observation tower and the structure at to top of the Wildcat Gondola. There are several summits and quite a bit of steep up and down. The descent to Carter Notch Hut features the Rock Slide. I had blissful visions of butt sliding for 0.6 miles, but it was not to be. Just more picking my way down among the boulders. One More had started quite a bit later than me, but he passed me and hurried on, so as not to be late for supper. My objective by then was to avoid injury and I was late. The Croo very kindly served me anyway, lentil soup and lasagna. I had a bunkroom to myself and slept soundly, other than a severe round of muscle cramps in the middle of the night.","Pinkham Notch

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538564,"The previous day's hike took a lot out of me, and my time to the hut was very slow. Looking at the planned profile, up and across Carter Dome, Middle Carter and North Carter, I became concerned that excessive fatigue would make me injury-prone. With some reluctance I decided to take the 19 Mile Trail downhill to Rte 16, a relatively easy 3+ miles. I spent some time enjoying and photographing the beautiful surroundings, the pond and the mountains, then headed down. Along the way two Croo members passed me, one of whom was carrying recyclables down off the mountain. The Croo packs in all the provisions and carries the recyclables back to civilization. I was impressed with the ease with which the young lady carried her pack. Once back at the hostel, I showered and put my laundry in the bin. Then out for lunch and back for a nap. Fred needed a ride from Pinkham Notch, so I went and got him, in return for dinner at The Salt Pub. The food was good: I had a large salad and some fresh pea soup with ham. Marni who owns the hostel got a call from Teddy, who is SoBo with his dog Baxter. Baxter was having trouble with the rough terrain and Teddy was looking to skip the Whites and go down to the Hikers Welcome Hostel in Glencliff. Since it would not be too far out of my way while driving home, I volunteered to give him a ride, be a trail angel when the opportunity presented itself. So in the morning I picked them up and drove down to Glencliff. I enjoyed seeing the hostel again, I have happy memories of time spent there while slack-packing Moosilauke. Baxter is a Standard Poodle, very well behaved in the car. Back home, I'm planning to do some work improving my VO2, interval training with a heart rate monitor, etc. I'm mildly anemic and possibly I can improve things by working on getting more oxygen through the system. If that develops favorably I will pick up where I left off - up the 19 Mile Trail to Carter Notch Hut one day, then back on the AT NoBo the next. Also, I plan to temporarily lighten my pack, go the no cook route, minimize extra clothing, leave spare batteries and excess electronics behind, use a lighter sleeping bag, etc. Carrying a lighter pack, well rested and in peak condition I anticipate that I can continue on into Maine and Mahoosuc Notch.","Carter Notch Hut

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539327,"I was unhappy and somewhat embarrassed after ending my most recent section hike in the White Mountains several days earlier than planned. After one day on the extremely rugged terrain of the Wildcats, I became concerned that excessive fatigue would make me injury-prone if I continued without taking a rest. Back home I reviewed my bloodwork with the Dr. I'm mildly anemic which will bear watching, but most people don't experience symptoms with hemoglobin that is slightly below the normal range. As a way of getting a better picture of it, I bought a heart rate monitor (HRM), timed myself for a rapid one mile walk, observed the ending pulse rate, and used the data to estimate VO2 max. That's a measure of maximum oxygen uptake. The first estimate, at 31.78, is within the average range for a man my age.My resting pulse, which was under 60 in 2013 (while training for an attempted through-hike), now stands in the low 70's. Those figures can be improved somewhat by training. Looking back on what I've been doing over the past several years, I've reduced the intensity of training hikes by going at a comfortable pace and flat-landing more than I used to. Hyper-ventilation may not be good for you and I've avoided it, but leaned to far in the other direction. Intensity of workouts can be measured in terms of the resulting heart rate, so I went out hiking and pushed until I reached 152, the max for my age. Then I kept it in the 120-150 range for a while. In order to get up to that level, I wound up trail-running, both uphill and down. There are a number of medical organization that publish recommendations on optimal intensity, how many minutes per week should be done at a vigorous level, or whatever they call it. I've been walking about 5 times per week, averaging maybe 3 miles per day, mostly in the woods, when not doing section hikes. The plan is, to average about 5 miles per day, with one 10 miler. Also, to run one of the miles each day at a pace sufficient to bring my heart rate up into the 120-150 range.I will monitor estimated VO2 Max and resting heartrate for a while, with the idea of getting a 10% improvement. That and a lighter pack should make it more realistic to plan to finish the White Mountains and continue on into Maine. Meanwhile I've done enough miles that I should be able to finish the trail next year, when I will be turning 70.   ",,Section Hiker Needs Trail Legs,"Jun 23, Thu",0

Hight, Zeta Pass, South Carter Mtn, Middle Carter Mtn and North Carter Mtn. The views were outstanding. At one point you could look across a valley to see Mount Washington and all the other peaks traversed by the AT. It's fun to look at something like that and say ""I hiked those peaks."" I met Earth, who was doing the same route, and we talked a bit while resting at various high points. Zeta Pass, according to AWOL, has a reliable water source. I didn't like the looks of it, brown with tannin and foam-covered in places, and elected to pass on it. The day was sunny and humid, and I came to regret that decision.

The notch is well-known as the most difficult mile of the trail and it's a good idea to have someone with you for that. There were a number of ponds. I've never seen a pond I didn't like, but on a gray and overcast day they didn't photograph well. I took a fall, landing (in succession) on my hand/wrist, elbow, and hip. I was careless placing a pole and it skated on me. It didn't hurt to walk, although it became painful to sleep on my left side and I had to sit carefully.

The trail had a lot of what I call slides. That's when it runs along a narrow band of bare rock, which may be wet and slippery. Frequently hikers go to the side and walk on the dirt while holding onto trees. This widens the trail and hurts the delicate alpine environment. The granite has pretty good traction but every once in a while it messes you up. I make an effort to walk the intended trail, but if there is a dirt section off to the side that seems safer to me I take it. Mount Success is in the middle of an alpine bog. There are bog boards leading up to the summit. (see photos) So the view from Mount Success embraces many higher mountains on the horizon, and is surrounded by a bog. Oh well.

The steel bar ladders look intimidating when you look at a photo, but not a big deal when you see them on the trail. When descending I had to give a little thought to positioning myself to get on them smoothly. There was a crew of young people working on the bog bridges. I stepped off one of them by accident, and my leg went in to the knee. Getting it out was a little bit difficult: the mud sucked on my boot and I didn't want to lose it. At one point the section under repair was a long trench about a foot and a half deep. I asked one of the crew members if there was an alternate route. He encourage me to stay on the trail, so I walked through it. Sort of ironic, here we have the Swamp Fox hiking high in the mountains, but still knee deep in black muck. The wind was strong at times, and the open spaces provided a nice view of the surrounding mountains. There were quite a few stories of hikers getting injured, and I got to feeling fearful about the upcoming descent of Mahoosuc Notch, which is the hardest part of the trail.

I met Earth on the 13th, and over the past few days we had been staying at the same shelters. He's German, 48, trained in Geography. Like me, he was forced off trail in 2013 and is now completing it in sections. We decided to do the Notch together. The Notch is a narrow area between two mountains/cliffs, loaded with large boulders. In places the most logical way forward involves crawling under boulders, and pushing or pulling one's pack. It's cool, and there was a certain amount of ice in various crevices. It's not heavily blazed, but the trail is clear enough, due to the wear on the rocks and the beaten down areas where most hikers walk. Some make a game of keeping their packs on, and not crawling under the boulders. The faster hikers take about an hour: Earth and I took three. We assisted each other by passing our poles forward and pushing/pulling each other's packs as needed. There were occasional consultations where the best route was in doubt. I made one mistake and stepped into a void between two boulders. My leg went in well above the knee and I got scratched and scraped, but no real damage. For part of it we were accompanied by a woman about our age, who took a picture of me crawling out from under a rock. She very kindly emailed it too me but it took me a while to figure out how to get it into this post. My phone had no charge and so, no pictures from me. After the Notch we headed up Mahoosuc Arm, which is steep but doesn't have a lot of difficult features. Earth went ahead and I took my time going up the trail to Speck Pond Shelter. My Sawyer Squeeze stopped working due to lack/failure of a gasket where the filter screws into the bag. If you tighten it too much it stops working and the untreated water flows out along the filter. I have since repaired it with a washer for a garden hose. I was carrying pills and treated some of my water that way: the rest I boiled. I ran out of food and fuel, as I had planned to do the section in five days but it took an extra half day to complete it. Boiling water uses a lot of fuel.

When I reached the parking lot, there was a woman doing trail magic, to include ice cold Cokes. I felt a little guilty, since I'm not a through hiker and my car was just a couple of spaces over. But I took one and thanked her profusely. I called the White Mountain Lodge and Hostel, and Marni had a bunk for me. It was my home away from home for this section. I stopped at a deli to get a sandwich and a soda. At the hostel I showered immediately and was back in my own clean clothing within an hour or two.

The climb up West and the East Baldpate was steep but there were no obstacles such as I encountered in the White Mountains. Considerable work had been put into building stone steps, most of which had about a six inch rise. Good for erosion control, also good for the knees, not doing those two foot lifts, body plus pack, with one leg. West Peak had no view to speak of. East Peak is mostly bare and the climb involved a longish section on bare rock. However, the grade was not too steep and after watching two younger hikers bounding up the bare rock, I did the same, at a more sedate pace. Blueberries were ripe and I browsed a few. Little Badpate comes next. I stopped there for a lunch braak and relaxed in the sun. From there the climb down was steep, and I got into my treehugging mode. Along the way I met Pancake, a teacher who is through hiking SoBo, and Tortor, who is a Section hiker NoBo. He describes himself as a slow hiker, and claims he only passed three hikers all the way from Springer. Make that four, adding me to the total. I stopped at Frye Notch Lean-to for water, and talked a while with Tortor who was tenting there. The climb out of Frye Notch was steep, with a great deal of stone stairs, very well constructed as mentioned above. At this point I got pretty tired and made slow time to the road.

I was grateful not to be carrying a pack, as there were numerous sections where the extra weight would have made things more difficult. I had forgotten to pack my hiking shirts, which are synthetic, quick-drying, etc. So I hiked in a flannal shirt, not a good idea as it impeded cooling. Eventually as it warmed up I took it off and hiked in a tee-shirt. There was good water at Sawyer Creek, while Hall Mountain Shelter had a small puddle of muddy looking water.

All the camp buildings are gone, replaced by seasonal homes, modest by today's standards. The place is far smaller than I remembered. It's pleasant, under tall pines, and private.I looked at the dam and pond where I used to fish, the sandy beach where I swam, and the meadow where we had cookouts and practiced archery. Back at the hostel, Naomi and I sang old songs together. Mostly country. She owns a 12 string guitar but hasn't played lately. After singing ""Have I told You Lately that I love you,"" she told a story of how when she was a child her family lived next to a couple who argued constantly, and loudly. During one very noisy argument, her mother, who played the accordion, treated them to a rendition of the song. Silence ensued. I had a good time, but I'm not sure the other guests cared for it. That's OK, you can't please everyone.","Pine Ellis Hostel

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544601,"The highlight of the day was the ascent of Old Blue Mountain. The trail climbs 900 feet in 0.6 miles as a starter. That works out to 3.5 feet sideways for every 1 foot up. Anything below 5:1 is steep, as far as I'm concerned. Thereafter the trail was more lenient, and well maintained with numerous stone steps. I had lunch at the summit, and was joined briefly by two other hikers. One was a peak-bagger, the other a section hiker. Water became an issue. A SoBo hiker informed me there was no water at Bemis Mountain Shelter, and of the two before the shelter, in one the water didn't look that good. I collected and treated 2 liters at the first and best source, and continued. I had read in a journal somewhere that there was stealth camping near the second source, where I planned to spend the night. At the second source, the water looked a little green and the flow wasn't rapid. I was dismayed to see that there were no tent sites in view. So I continued hiking, with 2 liters, and planned to tent as soon as I found level ground. After 0.3 miles, I reached the point where the Bemis Stream Trail comes in, and spotted something passable. There was a nice level site in view, but trail maintainers had dragged a lot of branches over the little side trails that led to it. I took it they don't want that area used, and took what I could get. and wound up with my head six inches higher than my feet. I used all my water to make supper and a cup of decaf. I figured in the morning I could backtrack 0.3 miles for water and enjoy my coffee and oatmeal, plus have something to hike out with.","S. Arm Road

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544608,"So in the morning, the first thing I did was backtrack 0.3 miles to get 3 liters of water. Lugging it back to my tent site, I treated it and cooked breakfast. I made a relatively early start, as I wanted to finish in time to get back to my car and move to a hostel in Rangely where I would be closer to the section of trail coming up next.I took a break at Bemis Mountain Shelter, but didn't check the water, since I had plenty. I had a snack of cheese and summer sausage. Bemis Mountain main peak would have nice views, but the trees are a little taller than the guidebooks say. In the area of Bemis Mountain 2nd Peak, the trail runs across a lot of bare rock, relatively level and very good traction. The heat and thin soil are ideal for blueberries, which were ripe and very tasty. I browsed several handfuls as I went along. There was no wind, and the sun made the bare rocks quite hot. I converted my long pants to shorts and paid attention to hydration. I was lucky to get service about an hour before I would arrive at Height of Land, which was the planned pickup, so I called Pine Ellis and they sent the shuttle out. It takes about an hour by car. James, who was taking the same shuttle, passed me about 100 yards from the finish. The view from Height of Land is outstanding. Mooselookmeguntic Lake and distant mountains. So, after hiking all day in the heat, I finally get there, and people are driving up in air-conditioned cars and getting the same view. Not fair. Back at the hostel, I booked a room at the Town and Lake Motel in Rangely, and a bunk at the Farmhouse Inn for the next night. I wasn't all that tired, but thought I would take the zero and do my last two days of this section well-rested. And so I motored further North.","Stealth campsite near Bemis Stream Trail

They have a few beat up canoes for guests, and I paddled solo for a half hour or so. The lake is very calm and peaceful in the morning. One person in a canoe, I sat in the bow seat, facing the rear, which balances things and makes it easier to handle if the wind is blowing.Breakfast was an egg, cheese and sausage sandwich on an English Muffin. In the small towns of Maine, frequently there is a gas station/general store/diner operation. They cook the sandwiches ahead of time and keep them in a warmer. Egg and cheese, with your choice of meat, labeled ""S"", ""B"", or ""H"", often available early in the morning. I drove toward Oquossic and found a place. The usual band of old men/contractors was sitting at tables on the porch, eating breakfast, talking and joking.I wanted to get a synthetic shirt suitable for hiking and found one in town, within walking distance from the motel.I moved to the Farmhouse Inn, for cost reasons, as well as the company of other hikers. I hung around, talking, playing the guitar and singing softly, napping, or browsing the internet. There was a miniature pig loose on the premises.

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544898,"The theme for this day and the next is ponds. Maine has a lot of lakes, many of which are labeled as ponds, and the trail runs along from one to the next, on more lenient terrain, over spruce and fir needles in many places. This is more of the hiking experience I was thinking of when I decided to do the AT, so I wanted to savor it and planned to do easy miles.In succession, I passed Moxie Pond, Long Pond and Sabbath Day Pond, then camped at Little Swift River Pond. It was sunny and very little wind. A fellow hiker gave me some Gatorade mix while at the Farmhouse Inn, and I mixed some up and concentrated on hydration. Turtur who is a Physiologist suggested I would enjoy my hiking more by paying attention to hydration and electrolytes. The science is, salt and sugar are absorbed better as a combo, and Gatorade reflects what is supposed to be the optimum balance. At Long Pond I stopped to take a swim. There is a little table there, and a sandy beach, although the water is shallow as far as 100 feet out from shore. I waded out to where it was up to my knees, then did the freestyle back in, with my hands touching at the bottom of my stroke. Skooch, Shawn and another hiker were there, and we cooked and at lunch at the table. I cut myself while slicing some summer sausage, and Shawn applied bandaids from my first aid kit. At least I finally got to use it. It seems to be healing well.I arrived at Little Swift River Pond about the same time as Rabbit, Subman and Suds, all of whom blog here at Trailjournals. I was a little slow picking a spot for my tent, and wound up pitching it over some rocks and roots that would poke me if I moved the wrong way. It wasn't bad enough to make me move the tent. For supper I had a Knorrs side, some kind of noodles Alfredo, with cheese flavor. As sold, it has no cheese. I added a good size chunk of sharp cheddar and got a pretty good mac and cheese. We all turned in about 8:00. While the terrain was lenient, the heat made it tiring.","ME Rte 17

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545008,"A short day, mostly downhill, followed by a longish drive home. It rained a bit during the night and early morning. I got up at 5:00 and took my time cooking breakfast and packing up. Rabbit who was tenting nearby carefully dried his tent with a small camp towel. I put mine away wet. After I got home I spread the contents of my pack out in the sun and got everything dry.There was a canoe at South Pond, in good condition but padlocked and chained to a tree. I met a young couple hiking with their dog and a very young child in a pack on the mother's back. This was just after a viewpoint from which I had done a steep descent. I personally wouldn't take a small child up a trail this steep for fear of falling, and said as much. Jeanne and I carried our youngest in the woods for short day hikes, but on more lenient terrain. As it turned out, they were going in the wrong direction for their goal which was Piazza Rock. I stood aside for a large number of boys, perhaps scouts, who were out on an 8 day trek to Grafton Notch, 46.8 miles. They were followed by 3 adult men, perhaps their leaders, one of whom was wearing new boots. Nobody had poles. One way hiking the trail has changed me is I like to sing more. The silence, the solitude, the beauty of nature, the rhythm of my footsteps, so on and so forth. Regretfully it doesn't take the form of writing a new song, just singing the old ones. As young man, I had the ability to remember the words for a lot of songs, something that has returned over the past several years. There are a few hikers who carry a musical instrument with them - a ukulele, a trail guitar, a 3/4 guitar, a mandolin, or in one case a full size electric with half the body chopped away. Some of the hostels have a guitar for hiker use, usually poor quality and old strings. As a section hiker, I've been bringing my guitar in the car and leaving it at hostels if I plan to return. That way I can play and sing a bit, and others can use it while I'm hiking.Many hikers wear ear buds and hike to music of their own choice, from iPods or whatever. They usually remove the buds long enough to say hi and have a safe hike. I guess the rhythm of the music helps them do the miles. Sometimes I get a song going in my head, which has a similar effect.   I reached the road (and my car) before noon. Marnie from White Mountain Lodge was visiting at the Farmhouse Inn and I asked her about a bunk for the Saturday night I would finish the section. There is an ATV gathering, some 10,000 people, which was scheduled for the weekend, and she expected to be full, but suggested I check on my way home. I did, but no luck. Too bad, because with their system of getting out of your hiker clothes on arrival, and wearing loaners and taking a shower while your laundry is done, you are very quickly cleaned up, both body and clothing. That, and breakfast is excellent, not to mention Pizza King delivers real food for supper. So I drove home. It's not all that far, and while I would have preferred to arrive clean and rested, not enough to run up yet another motel bill.","Little Swft River Pond

Shane drove three of us to a road that goes to Perham Stream, it's about a mile before you reach the trail. Heading south, I crossed Orbeton Stream and took a very short side trail to look at the waterfall. Due to the very dry weather, flow was minimal, although I've been told it's impressive after a rainstorm. At Poplar Ridge Shelter I stopped for lunch. A group of NoBos, mostly young, came in later. The water source is good, right in front of the shelter. After Poplar Ridge came Saddleback Junior. It was a gray day, and although the views were good they didn't photograph well. At Redington Stream Campsite I stopped and set up my tent, trying to beat the rain. The water source is in a bit on the blue-blazed trail, and actually there are two of them. The nearer looked a bit shallow although it was flowing well. The further was a strongly flowing stream with greenish tinted water. Slim Rims stopped by, and was the only other person at the site. She uses a hammock and we were going to have dinner together, but then the rain set in and she decided to cook under her tarp. I threw everything into my tent and ate pepperoni and snack/fuel bars.

The rain was gentle on and off early morning and I cooked and packed up in a drizzle, getting a lot of stuff wet. The day's hike included The Horn and Saddleback Mountain, both involving steep ascents and descents. The trail is above tree line for quite a bit, and a seriously strong wind set in. On Saddleback I wound up doing my usual imitation of weatherman Jim Cantore standing on the beach in a hurricane, swaying back and forth. Or maybe it was more like the crew of Starship Enterprise when taking enemy fire. The wind seemed to suck the breath out of my mouth. I was almost cowed, and took advantage of little pockets where the trees were tall enough to provide a point of refuge. Several young hikers passed me, dressed in tee shirts and shorts, exhilarated by the heavy weather. I layered up with a light down jacket under a shell and proceeded slowly and carefully. The wind was aggravating and tempted me to rush things. The top is pretty much level for a while, from cairn to cairn, and the descent got me out of the strong wind. On the way to Rte 4, I met White Cap and Braids again. They are an elderly couple, through-hiking, whom I first met in VA. Very strong hikers. I hurried past the trail to Piazza Rock, and passed up The Caves, both of which are popular destinations for day hikers. I had called Stacey at The Farmhouse to schedule a shuttle for 5:00 and I had to push to meet that. The Sandy River is just before Rte 4, going south, and is crossed by a heavy piece of aluminum over a sluice about 15 feet deep, as shown in the photo.

At the turnoff for Sugarloaf I met a man in his fifties who is thinking about a through hike. With my permission he followed down to the river, asking questions about hiking. I answered by recounting my experience as I interpret it. He was very fit and wound up helping me down the descent to the Carrabassett River, which is quite steep and rocky. I got in a situation where he had to take my pack so I could get out from between some rocks. I demonstrated pole-pitching techniques. I camped beside the river, with Gary, who works in sales management for a forest products company. He's well informed on ecology vs. forest products and we had a good discussion.

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546811,"Talking to Gary while eating breakfast and packing up, he was experiencing a run of equipment failure. His Sawyer Squeeze bag had ripped where the mouth is attached, making it useless. The Sawyer is poorly designed compared to the very similar Platypus bag in that the protrusions where you rest your thumb and finger are small, so the force is applied directly to the bag when you twist the cap. I was carrying two bags, and gave him my Sawyer, since the Platypus at 2 liters is very adequate. He thanked me, and solved the mystery of the missing gasket. It was pushed down into the mouth of the bag. So, two design errors: the gasket is to small and weak, and the mouth where the cap screws on needs larger protrusions at the sides where it attaches to the bag. The total elevation gain up over South and then North Crocker is about 2,000 feet, with a dip of about 500 between the two summits. Then it's 3,000 down to the road. There was a mix of NoBo, SoBo and peakbaggers at the summit. There are 48 peaks over 4,000 feet in NH, and one of the women was just completing NH as it was her 48th summit.

However, the weather report called for rain during the night, to let up around 7:00am, so I stayed put in the interest of not getting into a situation where I might have to tent in the rain.Weather.com works on a pattern of successive approximations. If you keep checking, they keep updating, and they are accurate enough to be helpful making decisions if you have the luxury of minimizing exposure to the elements. I was feeling somewhat demoralized, since many of the NoBos are focused on completing their hike and staying with their friends, and take little interest in making conversation with others. Many of them are tired. Anyway, I felt a little isolated and worked on not taking it personally. I went to a nearby laundromat, napped, played my guitar and made sure to be well fed on real food. I turned in early. Maine has elevated gas station food to a higher level, such as pre-made breakfast sandwiches. You get your choice of egg and cheese with bacon, ham or sausage, on a muffin, croissant or biscuit. Or donuts equally as good as what you would get a Dunkin Donuts, if not better.","ME 27

I climbed through an area of large moss-covered boulders, but somehow those who made the trail found a way to go around them, rather than over. Very pleasant. At Horns Pond Lean-tos I had lunch in a space shared with two NoBo through hikers who kept to themselves. I treated two liters of water. The source has a sign reminding hikers that the water comes from a very small watershed directly behind it, and asking them maintain water quality, that is, not to poop there. I filtered and applied UV. From there it was up South Horn and past a side trail to North Horn. The view of Horns Pond is outstanding. As I headed up Bigelow SoBos were telling me about the horrific wind, clutching at the rock, on all fours, etc. As the trail went above tree-line I was assaulted by a howling gale and wobbled along, propping myself with the leeward pole. For the last several hundred feet I stowed the poles. The trail is bordered and defined by rocks and rock formations big enough to serve as anchors, and I kept a grip on them while inching forward. Iron Maiden was ahead of me, and lingered at the summit to make sure I was OK. I signaled her to wait up. Eventually she came back down a bit and escorted me over the top, for which I was grateful as I was struggling. Once out of the wind everything was fine. I took some photos and Iron Maiden and IPA continued on down.There is a short descent to Bigelow Col. Down out of the wind, and as the adrenaline stopped flowing, I got a peaceful and serene feeling as I methodically made my way down the steep trail to the campsite. I got a platform and set up my tent. It took a while, because of the wind, and finding sticks the right size to go between the boards and serve as stakes.

I was hungry and cooked the rest of the Beef Stroganoff, doctoring it with beef jerky, salt, oil and sugar. After Little Bigelow the trail normalized to where it was slightly downhill over pine needles, dirt, duff etc., no rocks to speak of. I got a sense of release picking up to a normal pace and cadence. Making good time, I got to the road about 45 minutes before my shuttle was scheduled to arrive. Fortunately for me, Onesimus was doing trail magic at the parking lot and I had pasta with tomato sauce and sausage, salsa, watermelon and a soda. Onesimus is a biblical name, from St. Paul's letter to Philemon. It's about freeing a slave who had converted, on the grounds he was now a brother. Onesimus is now free of whoever or whatever enslaved him, and goes up and down the trail doing magic. Back at the Stratton Motel I booked a private room and showered. I went through the office to the common room and was surprised and happy to meet Garnet Turtle again.

I've seen pictures where the hiker is heroically clinging to it while crossing the raging torrent.Much of the day was spent walking under the conifers, beside and above the river. I leap frogged with Tinker who was planning to stay at the same shelter. It was the kind of trail I envisioned when I first started thinking about doing the AT. Some thoughts on senior hikers. Most of the middle-aged are raising children and working on their careers, so hikers are either young or old. It's common for retirees to work on their bucket lists and for some of them the AT is a major item. Long distance hiking is attractive to many of those who have done marathons, ultra marathons, or 10K type running. A lifetime of that type of recreation frequently results in damage to the knees, and surgical repairs. I've seen blogs by hikers who have completed a thru-hike on artificial knees but haven't met any myself. Heart valve repair has a slow recovery but improved speed and stamina result. Counting myself, I've seen 4 cases of elderly hikers who developed weight/emaciation problems. Those who make it to senior citizen status at normal body weight and capable of strenuous activity are likely to have good self-discipline about over-eating and junk food. That kind of works against you when gorging and eating junk are workable strategies. I've heard (or read) that the elderly don't experience thirst to the same as extent as the young. Speaking for myself, I've had situations develop where I had problems with hydration/electrolytes without feeling particularly thirsty. I don't like the idea of sucking water from a tube, as many hikers do. I make sure to drink when I take a break, and I've learned to do the chicken wing maneuver to get the bottle from the pouch on my pack easily. None of the elderly that I've talked to have done huge miles, night-hiking or partying in town. They are generally the first out of the shelter and do more of their hiking in the cool of the morning. I met one elderly hiker who was an experienced ultra-marathoner and trail- runner. He noted that balance and agility diminish with age. That's how I see it. In my case, that means I make very slow time over rough and rocky sections. For the past few days I noticed I had a lot more confidence going over that type of terrain. It may be that doing more of it improves the sense of balance. The water source at the shelter turned out to be the river. The shelter sits on a loop trail, and while there was supposed to be a spring at the northern junction with the AT, it was just a mud-hole. There's a side trail to the river midway between the north and south junctions with the loop trail. I walked down the loop to the north junction, then south on the AT to pick up water, and so back to the south junction and then on to the shelter. That way in the morning I could have a shorter distance to hike for the day.","Bald Mountain Pond Lean-to

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548165,"I said goodbye to Tinker in the morning: he was planning to stay at a different hostel and do the 100 mile wilderness while I was going to head for home. ""Boogie on,"" as he would put it. I got an early start and took my time. The trail was easy, but it got hot and humid and I had to get down to shorts, short sleeves and no hat to be adequately cooled. NoBos were pouring past, rushing to get to Monson. There is a sense of urgency as they are looking forward to the 100-Mile Wilderness and Katahdin. The ford of the other branch of the Piscataquis was another rock hop, with the line completely unnecessary. At the parking lot I called Shaw's for a ride but all their cars were out doing shuttles. No problem, Ponytail Paul asked me if I wanted a ride while I was still on the phone. He is working on being like Miss Janet. I took a private room at the hostel, showered and dressed in town clothes. I had dinner sitting at the bar at Lakeshore House, a big bacon cheeseburger and a garden salad. The place was full of happy hikers, celebrating in advance of the upcoming ""last hard part"" before Katahdin. I got to feeling a little wistful that I would be going home and most likely not doing the 100-Mile Wilderness until next year. I was starting to get that on a mission feeling...I slept well and after having the fine breakfast for which the hostel is known I headed for home in the morning.","Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549634,"This is the first day of a section hike in VA, planned for approximately 100 miles. Driving down from CT, I camped at Caledonia State Park in PA so as to make it a comfortable two day drive without paying for a motel. In the morning Michael shuttled me South from the Woods Hole Hostel to VA 606, where the trail crosses, not far from Trent's Grocery. Slack-packing North I made pretty good time. The trail was pleasant, with quite a bit of rhododendron tunnel and a lesser amount of tall pines cathedral. Tread was good.Along the way I met father and son team Billy Budd (after the Herman Melville novel) and Magic. Magic is somewhat overweight and suffered a heart attack not that long ago. He has lost about 30 pounds and is hiking in order to improve cardiovascular health and lose additional weight. Billy had a silent heart attack in his 40's and now about 70 he is a strong hiker. Billy took the lead and I kept up easily, except on the uphills where his pace was faster than I could keep up with and have a conversation. Arriving at the hostel I grabbed a soda, showered and changed, and hung out while waiting for supper. They had just received three pet pigs, from New Zealand, a breed that doesn't get bigger than 150 pounds and can eat grass. Neville was holding one of them and it emitted an ear-piercing squeal, similar to fingernails on the blackboard. No more holding until they are properly tamed. Supper was delicious. I took a private room and slept comfortably.","VA 606

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549637,"The previous evening at the Woods Hole Hostel I met Terry, Curt and Ed, three gentlemen from GA, my age and older, collectively the Trekkers - Sky Trekker, Winn Trekker, and I forget the third. We decided to slack pack from the hostel down to Pearisburg, and arranged for Neville to pick us up in the area of the New River Bridge. We made good time. Along the way I met Jilldebeest, a SoBO who recognized me from up in NH. During the descent to Pearisburg it was steep and I started to get twinges from my toes, where the nails were being driven into the front of the boot due to walking downhill on the steep terrain. There were a number of outstanding views, to include Angel's Rest which is a popular destination for day hikers. The hike has a false bottom. Just when you think your descent is complete, you get to climb some more and then go back down. Back at the hostel, I had planned to go with Michael and Neville to a large gathering of Old Time musicians, but I was tired and turned in about 8:00. I like that kind of music but wanted to be sure to be well-rested for the next days hike. Planning to go from Rte 52 (Bland) back to VA 606, the dry weather has created problems with water. However, there was a hiker there who had stayed at Jenny Knob the night before, and he advised that there was water, shallow but potable when treated.","Sugar Run Road

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549710,"I drove to Trent's Grocery on VA 606, where Bubba picked me up and shuttled me to Bland, Rte 52 where I left off earlier in the year. I would do an overnight hike back to the car, staying at Jenny Knob. The hike started out steep then turned into a very agreeable ridge walk. After Helveys Mill Shelter there would be no water until Jenny Knob Shelter, so I hiked out with two liters. Along the way I met Jilldebeest again. There was a large family group doing a hike, sitting by the side of the trail. One of their number was obese and willing to make conversation, but the rest of them didn't seem to want to join in. Maybe it was another one of those family conferences, what to do with a member who is slowing down the parade of progress and/or endangering his health due to overexertion. I hiked on. At the shelter I met (again) 4.0, Blue Samurai and Splinter, SoBos who recognized me from New Hampshire at Carvers Notch Hut. As a section hiker and jumping around I see familiar faces from time to time. 4.0 and Splinter made a fire, something that becomes rare after the novelty wears off and the weather gets warmer. I participated by going up the trail and dragging back some fallen branches of the proper size. My strategy is to take the trail away from the shelter until potential firewood becomes abundant, then I drag back enough to make it worth the extra distance. The area around shelters sometimes is picked clean, nothing but twigs...The water source was marginal. Going down a short trail to the stream, I was greeted by a soupy mess of orange glop. I've seen the same stuff where water runs through abandoned coal mines in PA. While I was up in NH, I listened to a counselor for the Mowgli Camp lecturing his campers to go upstream at the water source in order to get the best quality. So I applied the advice, and a short distance up stream located a splendid puddle, crystal clear, 2 X 3 feet, perhaps 3 inches deep. I bailed 3 liters into my Platypus and Sawyer bags and lugged my precious treasure back to the shelter for treatment. Various small life forms were present, to include mosquito larvae. It's a good sign when water supports life. So during and after supper we had a nice conversation and turned in early. Unfortunately one of my shelter mates got up more or less hourly and although he used a red light it kept waking me up. Or it could have been the coffee. I had some packets of instant that are advertised as 50% more and elected to have a cup while waiting for supper to cook. Small mistake. In any event, I didn't sleep well.","US 52

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549711,"My shelter mate was an early riser and by 4:30 he was packing up. I usually wake up about 5:00 and lie there quietly until somebody starts moving, usually when you hear the whoosh of the first JetBoil it's OK to get up, you won't be bothering anybody at that point. So I got up at 5:00 and started getting ready too. It was a short day. The last part of the hike was a meadow walk followed by a good size suspension bridge over Kimberling Creek. At the road I had forgotten which way to turn in order to get back to Trent's Grocery and my car. So I turned on MapMyHike, a freebie that gave me a map that showed enough for me to figure out to go left. At the store I grabbed a junkie pastry and a cup of coffee before driving back to Woods Hole. At the hostel before lunch time, I asked the hikers there if anyone wanted to go to Pearisburg for lunch, and Ireland decided to come along. We talked for a while over lunch (pizza). When the conversation drifted into the area of music on the trail, we both realized we were talking about the same guitar, an electric version that had the body trimmed to a minimal size and was accompanied by an orange 5 watt battery operated amp. Back in 2014 at Bill Ackerly's house, the Ice Cream Man, it was his birthday and a bunch of Harvard students sang Happy Birthday for him. Ireland remembered me singing and playing Johnny Cash, the Folsom Prison Blues, on the aforementioned electric guitar, which a young NoBo had lugged all the way from Springer. Small world. Back to the hostel and lobbed around for the rest of the day.","Jenny Knob Shelter

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549989,"After four days of hiking, I took a zero, to rest up, also to get in sync with the Trekkers, who were planning to continue NoBo with pretty much the same objectives as I had. The first order of business was to take care of my feet. The downhill sections in Virginia are like a ramp rather than stairs, so the toes will have a tendency to bump into the front of the boot. Regretfully I missed a stroke on cutting my toenails and wound up with purple bruises on both big toes. I drove 15 twisty miles to Pearisburg and bought a sanding block and a pair of nippers. The nails have gotten quite thick in recent years and are difficult to cut. I sanded them down to where they wouldn't cause further injury. I made a separate trip for lunch, and took advantage of WiFi at McDonalds and a computer with keyboard and internet at the library to update my blog. There is service on the high points in VA but I don't have the patience to do a lot of typing on the phone. It was cloudy on and off and I didn't manage a good sunbath. Proprietors Michael and especially Neville place considerable emphasis on a sense of community and also on topics relating to spiritual development, gratitude, meditation and so on and so forth. Being something of a loner and having done a lot of work on the spiritual angle back years ago I got to feeling a little out of place and out of sorts. Eventually I arrived at the idea that the hike is a journey promoting personal growth, that I had a fantastic growth opportunity in front of me, and would do well to hang in there and go along with the program. The food is good there, lots of salads with fresh home-grown produce, with a good balance of beef and pork plus home-baked bread, delicious. So the day was uneventful and I got rested up. We spent some time working on the next few day's hike and wound up planning an overnighter SoBo to Pearisburg. The main considerations were dry conditions and limited water sources, that and avoiding the climb out of Pearisburg.","Woods Hole Hostel

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549995,"This was the first day of an overnighter, SoBo from VA 635 back to Pearisburg. We weighed ourselves with and without packs before we set out: Curt, Terry and I came in slightly under 30 pounds, Ed checked in at 36. Water along the route was somewhat limited and unreliable, so we planned on hiking to the campsite where we knew there was water. We went southbound in the interest of avoiding the long climb out of Pearisburg. The hike was uneventful. We took turns leading, and kept pretty much together, except when somebody would drop back or mosey ahead for a little while. My companions are conservatives: Ed is hard-ass while the others are merely staunch. They accepted me as the bleeding heart liberal of the group and we kind of stayed away from politics and ideology. It was an elderly group: Terry and I are in our late 60's: Ed and Curt (who were room-mates in flight school) are mid-seventies. We got a somewhat late start due taking a wrong turn while driving to the starting point. We reached the campsite before dinner and had time to set up, collect and treat water, etc. before it got dark. The source was a spring below but close to the trail. The first pool was piped such that you could collect water in a shallow container. The water was clear. We had one SoBo thru-hiker for company, a truck driver from Montreal, Quebec whose work takes him into the US on a regular basis, mostly out West but occasionally down Interstate 81 where he can look at the mountains he has been climbing.","VA 635

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550051,"It was a short day, back to Pearisburg, where our cars were at the Farm Bureau parking lot. From there Ed went to Blacksburg to scout out a motel while the rest of us tacked on another 2 miles between the two points where VA 635 has parking for the trail. It was a gray day, cool and misty, ideal for hiking but not photography. The Captain's Place is between the two parking areas on VA 635. We passed it but didn't cross on the zip line as we were near the end of our hike and planned to stay elsewhere. The Captain permits hikers to camp on his property and makes sodas available. Driving over to Blacksburg, Ed had selected the Microtel which is relatively basic and cheap, but was much better than the average hiker motel. It had large mirrors on the wall which did nothing for me, who wants to look at what age has done to their body? I straightened up and sucked it in, but not much improvement. Dinner was at the Outback, which is a chain restaurant known to most readers. The steaks were good. Ed decided to opt out of the last two days of hiking, he was listening to his body. We had a discussion of zero days: I take them regularly, every three or four days if it's convenient. The others don't do them often, Curt on his last outing went fifteen days without, and for the current hike both he and Terry did eight days straight. Planning for the final two days, we came up with a car camping idea: leaving the cars at VA 632 where there is water and room for camping, we would be shuttled to VA 635 and hike North. After the first day we would camp and resupply from our cars, before continuing on to VA 630. It's another form of slack-packing.   ","Campsite at mile 643

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550070,"We met up with shuttle driver Don Raines and he led us to VA 632 where we left the cars. He then drove us to VA 635 where we started the day. Although we all had cars with us it was more convenient to use the shuttle: Don has an abundance of local knowledge and the small roads in rural Virginia can be confusing, not to mention hard on a car if it sits close to the ground. It rained very hard while we were riding to the starting point, then completely let up just before we started the hike. So we got a late start, about 9:30, but as compensation we didn't get wet.The hike featured some rough and rocky sections. The rock in the area is similar to slate or shale, quite smooth, and when it gets wet footing can be tricky. I had less trouble than the others, perhaps because I hiked in PA, NH and ME earlier in the year and got used to bad tread. There were some longish ascents where I struggled but managed to keep up. Terry is strong on the uphills. It was gray and misty most of the day, with views obscured. The cool weather made for comfortable hiking. Arriving at our destination, we got our packs and tents out of the cars and set up down by the creek. There were several nice tent sites and an abundance of fallen wood suitable for making a fire. After supper, we got a fire going and I fetched my guitar and sang and played for a while. My companions, while acknowledging that I have a good voice and guitar technique, remarked that I didn't sing songs anybody ever heard. Curt had a bivvy and tarp arrangement that wasn't too reliable in bad weather. Terry was carrying a light 2 person tent which he and Curt shared. There was no rain. I slept soundly until a tree or branch fell loudly during the night. That happens sometimes, they just fall at random intervals for no discernable cause.","VA 635

I overslept and had a trail bar for breakfast instead of my usual oatmeal. The first part of the hike was a longish climb, about 1,800 feet, not steep but unrelenting. We met a squirrel hunter, armed with a 22 which had a scope on it. He had bagged five of the little critters and was taking them home to Mom. He cleans them for her. There was much discussion of gray squirrels and red squirrels, both seen in the area, how to clean a squirrel, how tasty is the gravy, eating rodents, etc. At Kelly Knob we paused a moment, checked out the view, and called Don Raines with an ETA. I suggested we use 1.5 mph, which seemed conservative. The trail down from there was rough and rocky, and we arrived about 15 minutes earlier than estimated. Kelly Knob is a popular destination for day hikers, and we exchanged greetings with quite a few of them. The last part of the hike was a meadow walk between VA 42 and 630. At 630 we talked to a man whose son had fallen along with a hunting stand. It was in a tree but whatever was holding it there slipped or broke. He had a couple of broken ribs and a collapsed lung. Hunting season is just getting going there and orange hats and/or vests will be in order for hikers. We also met Disco, an 18 year old thru-hiker. She looked young, so we asked her about her age, what do Mom and Dad think, etc. Then I volunteered that we were late 60's and older. She didn't ask because it would be rude, I like to volunteer the info because at my age I'm proud to be out hiking the trail, even as a section hiker at modest speeds. Terry gave her various items of no cook food, trail magic. Don arrived in due course, back to the cars, and so to home. I did 96 miles in 8 days hiking, averaging 12 miles per day. Woods Hole was a good place to stay, aside from that there wasn't a lot of stuff you had to see. Going a little further North next year there will be the Keffer Oak, Dragons Tooth, McAfee Knob, Guillotine, Audie Murphy monument, etc.I've hiked alone for much of the trail. It was fun to be part of a group for a while. It should be noted that Conservatives tend to be self-reliant, don't look for a free ride on anything, and expect a lot of themselves.

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550253,"I drove a couple of hours to attend the annual ALDHA gathering, which ran from 10/7 to 10/9. I enjoyed the scenery, there were areas where the foliage was showing quite a bit of color. After registering Friday I set up my tent on the field which served as a campsite and hung around talking to hikers. A majority of those in attendance were old, perhaps because ALDHA isn't adept at the use of social media, works more by newsletters. I skipped the opening ceremonies at Williams College in the interest of going to sleep early. As it turned out, there was a bonfire at the campsite and the partying and noisemaking went on 'til after 3:00 am. That and it got cold, while the field gave off a lot of moisture. Between that and my breathing the tent was soaked with condensation and became very uncomfortable. A late arrival in a tent next to mine regaled his companion with a rapid moving account of his life since they hiked together some 15 or 20 years ago. It was along the lines of ""so then I moved back in with Mom and Dad (for the 3rd time), oh well that relationship didn't work out, some day I'll have to get a career type job,"" etc. All of this in a breathless tone, as if each iteration was a new and surprising event. Eventually a woman came over and asked them to keep it down. They tried talking back a bit, suggested she should have brought earplugs, and that the sleeping area was ""over there somewhere."" Eventually they gave it up. Never a dull moment. I got up at 6:00 am and went to town for breakfast to include a nice warm cup of coffee. I returned and packed up my soaking wet tent, for the last time this year. I went to two of the many workshops, one on restoring the American Chestnut and one on hiking the Adirondack State Forest. Both were interesting and informative. The presenter for the Adirondack talked about doing some 235 miles in 10 days with one resupply, in the interest of seeing the ""true wilderness."" I'm from upstate NY originally and might enjoy hiking the area, but not at the pace mentioned, and certainly not on one resupply. The route described includes some bushwhacking, not a favorite sport for me. Most of the audience was elderly. On the American Chestnut, it flourished in the Appalachians and was a major factor in the economy until the blight arrived from China. The approach taken has been to cross surviving American Chestnuts with blight-resistant Chinese variants and then backcross to American Chestnuts, while discarding any plants that don't show resistance. They now have trees that are 15/16's American with good resistance, which they are interbreeding and culling further. They have seeds that are being distributed to members of their association. The trees grow rapidly. The wood is strong and durable, doesn't rot easily, and the nuts are relished by wildlife. In Italy they have numerous excellent recipes using European Chestnuts which can be made using the American variety. I should mention, I met DulciGirl who blogs here on TrailJournals and encouraged her to update more often. I like her writing style. Of course it's hard to stay current, lack of service, plus who wants to hike all day then type anything too long on the tiny keyboard of a smartphone.Also Miss Janet, in photos, trail angel extraordinaire.","Williamstown, MA

I wasn't in very good shape in the Spring and made a slow start completing Pennsylvania. Then I went down to VA and did about 100 miles centered around Damascus during May. From there I went up to New Hampshire during the Summer and finished the Whites and pressed on into ME, getting as far as Monson. Finally in September I did about 100 miles more in VA.I struggled with the Whites, and went home for three weeks after having a hard time with the Wildcats. I trained fairly hard and when I went back I was able to continue the hike at a measured pace. Mahoosuc Notch was a challenge, and I caught some heavy weather on Saddleback and the Bigelows in Maine.As a section hiker I frequently met thru-hikers at different points in their hike, since I was jumping back and forth from state to state while filling in the blanks. I continued to enjoy the experience, although late in the year I developed a strong preference for slack-packing. I guess there is a limit to how often I want to pack up a wet tent and lug it on up the trail. Eating much more real food, I didn't experience any severe problems with weight loss or lack of energy. For me, completing the hike is about personal growth, in kind of an ill-defined way, the whole experience to include the beauty, the hardships and the people I meet helps me become myself as I advance into old age. Next year, if all goes well, in the Spring I will do the remaining miles in Virginia, which will include McAfee's Knob, the Guillotine, the Keffer Oak, the Dragon's Tooth, and other well-known landmarks. Then during the Summer I will do the 100 Mile Wilderness and complete my hike at Katahdin. There's a mile or two in Vermont that I missed after I took a fall. I can pick that up when I drive North to resume the hike at Monson. Thanks everyone for reading.
