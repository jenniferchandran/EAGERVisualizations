Champagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527184,"When preparing for a trip as complex as a thru hike, all the planning in the world can't replace some time well spent on the trail to get a sense for what you will need and more importantly what you can afford to do without. After a solid month of prep work, mainly researching and acquiring gear, it was time to hit the trail for a few days. After loading up my pack I discovered that my battle to control pack weight had not turned out as well as expected. Full pack weighed in at 40 lbs! My goal had been significantly lower. I conducted my test hike on the AT south of Rockfish Gap, VA. During the course of 4 days spent on trail, hiking no more than several miles from my parked vehicle, I shed about 10 lbs of pack weight. It wasn't easy, most of it ounce by ounce. It takes a change in mindset to realize that most of the stuff was non-essential and could be left behind. Thru hiking is all about simplicity.
Beyond getting the pack squared away, I easily determined that I'm a boots guy. I took 2 pairs of footwear to try out. A pair of Altra Lonepeak trail runners and a pair of Lowa Renegade boots. The boots won hands down on the rocky terrain. The Lowa's feel perfect on my feet, no hot spots, and great ankle support. Hope to carry them with me the whole way. Also, I swapped out hydration systems. I started with a bladder/hose system, using an inline filter to purify dirty water. It turned out that I'm now preferring the Smartwater bottles for their simpleness and lightweight. The thing that hung me up on the inline filter was the failure to positively continue working after being exposed to freezing temps. Don't want my water quality hinging on whether my filter may have hit a freezing temp at some point in its lifetime. After experimenting with Aquamira purification drops, I was won over. As long as I'm not needing to purify water that looks bad, I think the drops are going to do the trick.
One last note... to those who may be tempted to cook a meal inside your tent, do yourself a favor and keep a door flap open for an easy exit point if something goes haywire. While boiling hot water on my jetboil stove, I added a brick of ramen noodles before turning the heat down from full blast. This caused a bubble over and in a split second scalded my hand, tipped over, and turned into a ball of flame. I had to grab the CLOSED mesh door, rip it open, and chuck the stove out. Miraculously, nothing was burned including me..just a ripped tent door. So now I wait for my tent to be repaired and shipped back (really glad I got the LightHeart tent- outstanding customer service). 
Hope to be starting the trail in GA sometime next week. Keep ya posted!",,Shake Down Trip,"Apr 09, Sat",0
Champagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528141,"Its Friday 4/15 and as I write this entry im seated in a train car being jostled around with the clack of the tracks below. The train arrived in Charlottesville, VA on schedule and I boarded a packed passenger car. I said my goodbyes and waived to family as the train pulled away and slipped into the night.The train will take me to Gainesville where I'll meet up with a buddy for a hitch out to Amicalola Falls State Park. I will begin my thru-hike on the A.T. Approach trail which begins at the Amicalola visitors center. The approach trail is a 9 mile ascent to the summit of Springer Mtn. My goal is to reach the summit saturday night and begin the A.T. sunday morning.Hope to get some rest tonight..i'm in for a 10 hour ride.",,"Springer Mountain, GA","Apr 15, Fri",0
Champagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529370,"It’s Friday, April 22nd. I’m taking my second “zero” at Neel Gap, GA. A “zero” is the hiker term for a day with no trail miles. I’m taking the time off to rest both of my achilles tendons which have become sore. I’ve hiked 40 miles since starting, averaging 8 per day. I can feel my mind and body settling into the routine of thru-hiking and believe my pace will increase over the next weeks. For now, my progress hinges on my achilles tendons. I don’t believe they are injured, rather have only become agitated from the sudden rigors of thru-hiking. While the two days off has helped, minor inflammation still occurs on the tendons while walking, specifically when pushing off with the foot. I can’t see doing a third zero in a row, so I’m planning to get back on trail tomorrow for a low milage day. My thru-hike started without any hangups on saturday morning. Two friends picked me up from the train station in Gainesville and drove me to the Amicalola Falls SP visitor center to begin the Approach Trail leading to Springer Mtn. A representative with the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) stood by to register my start. I hiked most of the Approach Trail on Saturday, but stopped to overnight at a campsite about a mile shy of the top. Sunday morning I completed the Approach Trail and made it to the summit of Springer Mtn, which is the southern terminus of the A.T. A Boy Scout troop was at the summit taking in the view when I arrived. I was able to share with them that I was beginning a thru-hike and had set the goal of doing so when I was their age during a trip similar to the one they were on. I can remember standing on top of Mt. Katahdin, which is the northern A.T. terminus, as a 14 year old scout thinking how awesome it would be to return one day after hiking all the way from Georgia.I stayed at the top of Springer for a while taking in the moment. After the scout troop headed down, a big group of lady hikers arrived to the summit. They were doing their annual hike of Springer and had brought in a bottle of champagne to celebrate. After they learned of my thru-hike they offered me a paper cup and poured me some bubbly. It was good to relax and talk with the group before starting out. Several that I talked with were experienced long-distance hikers that had some great tips on strategy and mindset. Not sure what I was expecting at Springer, but I was a bit taken back by the positive people I met there. I signed the logbook before heading down.. “Destination Mt. Katahdin, ETA unknown”. I found the trail that was marked with white blazes and was on my way.I’m fortunate to have been able to take my two zero days in Neel Gap where there is free tent camping and a full resupply store on site. The A.T. actually runs through the stone breezeway between the resupply store and the hiker hostel. There’s an old tree with hundreds of pairs of hiker shoes thrown over the limbs. Not a bad place to be if you gotta be laid up for a couple days!","Springer Mountain, GA

Champagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532090,"It’s Sunday, May 8th. I’ve been off trail a few days for my brother’s college graduation weekend. It’s been a while since my last entry, so I figured this would be good chance for an update.I left Neel Gap, GA on Sunday, April 24th after stopping for three and a half days to rest both my achilles tendons. The tendons had not fully recovered when I left Neel Gap, but within several days of being back on the trail the inflammation I was getting when pushing off was gone. With the constant ups and downs of elevation change that come with hiking, I was glad to have the sore tendons healed up.On Wednesday, April 27th, I made my first town stop in Hiawassee, GA to resupply and spend the night at a motel in town. The motel offered a free shuttle service to pick up and drop off at the trail so it was hard to turn down. I got laundry washed and a hot shower felt great. The local grocery store had a full salad bar which I took advantage of. The night ended around a bonfire with other hikers on the front lawn of the Hiawassee motel. The motel manager was very hiker friendly even supplying us with scrap wood from around the property to keep the fire blazing. After leaving Hiawassee and getting back on trail the following day, I was ready to finish the remaining section of approximately a dozen miles before crossing over the North Carolina border.Completing the trail in Georgia, and my first state of the trip, was pretty special. I still can’t believe I walked out of Georgia from Amicalola Falls SP. About 75 miles of trail are in GA and I will miss this first section of my hike as I journey into other states. The trail was well maintained in GA and I will always have good memories of my first miles hiked in this state. On Friday May 29th I came to the border of GA and NC. The border was marked by a simple wooden plaque nailed to a tree with a white blaze. There was a logbook in a metal tube, which I signed before entering the beautiful state of North Carolina.On Sunday, April 30th I hiked in my first bit of rain which was off and on during the afternoon. I had hiked in warm temperatures with no rain until that point. I camped a few hundred yards from Winding Stair Gap with the intent of getting a ride into the town of Franklin, NC the following morning for a resupply. The next morning I met up with a few other thru hikers by the highway that runs through Winding Stair Gap and began discussing plans to get transportation into town. One of the hikers, “Rambler”, mentioned his aunt and uncle lived in the area and would be glad to offer extra seats to those of us that needed a ride. After a short while of waiting, we were surprised to see a Ford Excursion limo take a turn into our parking lot. I looked over at Rambler who had a blank look on his face. He looked at me and said with disbelief, “That might be my uncle”. Fortunately it was his aunt and uncle, who operated a limo service, and we were all invited to pile in the back for a ride to Franklin. Perhaps confirming my trail name of “Champagne”, I received my second trail magic of champagne-now in two states- at the behest of kind folks that my path has crossed. Before we pulled out in the limo, we were provided with glasses and a toast of champagne. Rambler’s aunt and uncle gave us a grand tour of Franklin and were outstanding hosts to us hikers passing through on the trail.Thru-hikers tend to stay in like company on the trail. Perhaps it’s our pace that keeps us separated from other folks on the trail. Or maybe as thru-hikers our common goal of hiking the trail start to finish allows us to bond with each other but not be as connected with other hikers we share the trail with. In any case, I had the pleasure of meeting two day hikers on my last few miles before arriving at the Nantahala Outdoor Center (N.O.C.) on Tuesday, May 3rd. I had already hiked about 15 miles before meeting “Baloo” and “Squirt”, but their companionship made it easy to knock out the last 5 miles to get into the N.O.C. Congrats to them as they will be graduating college and beginning graduate student programs.Making the N.O.C. by Tuesday night was a big accomplishment. At 20 miles, it was the most miles per day thus far and put me in position to use my two days before leaving the trail to push ahead and get up to Fontana Dam, NC. Leaving the N.O.C. was the longest “up” of the trail thus far and had a dreaded reputation amongst thru-hikers. Due to the all-day uphill climb, I settled for an 11 mile day, but would need to make up miles the last day to arrive in Fontana on time. It rained all night long and when I woke up the next morning it was still raining with some sleet mixed in. I was needing to hike about 17 miles to make it to highway 28 in Fontana and it appeared it would be a wet trip after getting a forecast for rain all day on my cell phone. I was pleased that after getting going I was staying dry for the most part. My Lowa Renegade boots kept the rainwater out beautifully, making me especially glad I went with this pair of boots. I got into Fontana and camped by the trail side about a half mile from highway 28. The next morning my driver, who I had worked out a shuttle schedule with for getting me on and off the trail, showed on time. I picked up a rental car in Sylva, NC and have been enjoying three zero days as part of celebrating my brother’s college graduation this weekend. I will be starting the Smoky Mountains when I get back on trail and crossing the Tennessee border. Thanks to those followers who have signed the guest book with encouragement. Your support is much appreciated. See you again down trail!","Neel Gap, GA

Champagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533790,"It’s Wednesday, May 18. I’m in the town of Hot Springs, NC for a resupply. I spent last night at the historic Sunnybank Inn which is a victorian style estate built in 1840 and has been a boarding house for hikers passing through town for the past 70 years. By the luck of the draw, I got the same bedroom that pioneer A.T. thru-hiker Earl Shaffer stayed in as he became the first hiker to complete an A.T. thru-hike in 1948.On Monday, May 9 I got back on trail from my brother’s graduation and begun the trail’s section through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The park has a reputation for diverse wildlife and it did not take long for me to see its most notorious creature. Before finishing my first day, I saw my first bear in the wild. I was hiking up a side trail that goes to a fire tower and scenic lookout that the A.T. bypasses. As I was coming to the top, the scenery began coming into view on my left side. After taking in the view on the left, I glanced ahead and the bear was on the trail looking right at me. He stood motionless, not more than 20 yards away. The black bear’s color contrast with everything else in the wooded environment makes them particularly spooky. I did a “smooth” u-turn and headed back down the side trail to the A.T., glad the bear didn’t follow. The next day I saw my 2nd bear as I was packing up from a lunch break. The bear was not as close this time. I could see him at a distance of about 30 yards off trail. I slung on my pack and continued down trail, grateful that he showed up after lunch was over.On Tuesday evening, May 10 I was closing in on my stop for the night at Spence Field Shelter. In the Smokies overnight stays are only allowed in designated campgrounds and shelter areas. I was a couple miles from my stop and following a ridgeline when I came up on two wild turkeys. They were in front on me and walking the same direction on the trail. I got my camera out and shot some good video, sneaking within about 15 yards of the pair undetected. I made it into my stop at the Spence Field Shelter at about six o’clock. I pitched my tent with a cluster of other tents below the shelter building and got settled. Around midnight, I awoke to a burst of people shouting, but couldn’t determine what the commotion was about. A while later someone from the shelter came over to the group of tents and told us there had been a bear attack. Apparently a hiker who was tented away from the designated site had a bear enter his tent and attack him. He had a swollen leg wrapped in an ace bandage from where the bear had bitten him. His cell phone was crumpled and the tent was shredded. The man was stable and in good spirits, but unable to hike. When I left the next morning the forest service was bringing in horses to ride him out. Hope he recovers quickly. After Spence Field Shelter, everyone was on high alert for bears. I was ready to put some miles between me and the bears around spence and ended up having my highest mileage day so far at 24 miles. That day’s hiking included clingman’s dome which is the trail’s highest elevation at 6,667 feet above sea level. So the silver lining to the bear activity was that it provided plenty of trail motivation!On May 11th and 12th, I overnited and resupplied in Gatlinburg, TN. Great tourist town. Seemed like Time Square in comparison to the other hiker towns. There were reports of bears coming into town, but I did not see any of them.On Saturday, May 14th I had another big day hiking 20 miles and completing the Smoky Mountains. Sunday, May 15th I passed through Max Patch, which takes the cake for best panoramic view thus far. The patch is the top of a rounded mountain summit which was cleared for pasture use a while back. The A.T. runs right through it and for about a mile you can hike surrounded by the a view of mountain ranges in all directions.I’m about to hop back on the trail for my next section. The trail runs down main street here in Hot Springs, from one end to the other. My next town stop is Erwin, TN in about 70 trail miles.","Fontana Dam, NC

Champagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534608,"It’s Monday, May 23rd. I’m packing up on the lawn of a hiker hostel in Erwin, TN. I had a good night’s rest with the sound of the Nolichucky River flowing in the distance. I made it into Erwin yesterday afternoon under clear skies. The previous three days have been overcast with nearly constant rain. As a result, the trail has been a muddy mess in sections. My hiking poles continue to prove their value, keeping me balanced during the “controlled slides” through slick spots.On Saturday evening, I got off trail with family relatives Margaret and Dudley to spend the night at their cabin. The warm meals and “dry out session” was much appreciated. I did a food resupply this morning to cover the next four days on trail. I’m about 100 miles from Virginia and will need one more resupply stop prior to crossing the next state border.","Hot Springs, NC

Champagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536429,"June 3rd: I’m in the small but lively trail town of Damascus, Virginia. Two popular trails traverse the town, the Virginia Creeper bike path and the A.T. It’s a rural mountain town that makes for a perfect place to stop and put up your feet for a rest.Along the last stretch of trail, I stopped at Mountain Harbour Hostel along Hwy 19E outside of Roan Mountain, TN for a quick resupply. I had heard some fanfare on the trail about the home cooked breakfast at Mountain Harbour and I was not disappointed. The hostel is family operated on the property of a farm. Breakfast was served in the family’s kitchen and dinning room. There must have been about 30 folks that showed up. I went through the buffet lineup of fresh cooked casserole dishes, sausage, ham, fruit, etc and had my plate filled out. After sitting down with some folks that were section hiking I realized my “thru-hiker hunger” had taken full effect. My plate had a few more layers than my companion’s plates and it was eaten clean without the slightest hesitation or regret. I seem to be requiring an ever increasing amount of food at each meal.Between Carvers Gap and Hwy 19E, I hiked through a long section of cleared highlands. Normally, only 50 yards or less can be seen of the upcoming pathway. So it was cool being out in the open for a change. Large sections of pasture like terrain streched for miles, over a range of mountains. Hikers in the distance appeared ant size as their figure moved down the trail.A few days ago, I had my first bear contact since the Smokies. North of Watauga Lake, while hiking I heard a tree branch snap ahead and to the left of my position. After looking up and seeing the branch tumble to the ground I spotted a bear in the tree it had come from..what to do!? As soon as the bear saw me it begun lowering itself down the tree at a rapid pace. I decided to continue ahead and pass the bear instead of backing up and potentially becoming blocked by the bear. Continuing ahead was averse to what one’s reflexes might be in that situation, because the bear was ahead and to my left. So for a moment, I was getting closer to the bear at the same time he was decending the tree. Fortunately, I passed him by and he didn’t follow. 3rd close quarters bear contact for the win.It feels great to be in my fourth state of this journey. GA, NC, and TN are complete. Now, I turn my focus to Virginia which includes more trail miles than any other state the trail crosses. I’m staying at Woodchuck’s Hostel here in Damascus. It’s one of the best run hostels I’ve seen thus far..and a great value with hot breakfast included. Highly recommend.","Erwin, TN

Champagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539500,"June 24th, Mile 727. I’m on a town stop in Daleville which is just north of Roanoke, VA. Much has happened since my last update.A couple days after leaving Damascus, I hiked through Grayson Highlands State Park and passed the 500 mile mark from Springer Mtn. Wild ponies roam the state park as well as the mountains to the south. I passed several groups of them grazing or galloping through the open terrain. The ponies are not shy and don’t seem to mind having their picture taken by the many passersby. GHSP is a excellent place to include in a section hike or day hike with nearby parking locations. They even have designated horse trails for the equestrian trail blazer.On June 9th, I resupplied in Marion, VA and managed to get laundry and a hot shower in. Marion is a 10 minute drive from the AT. Fortunately, I didn’t have to make that walk to town. As I came off trail by the highway at Mt. Rogers Visitor's Center, a gentleman with a van offered a ride. He was retired and enjoyed driving hikers around. As he put it, “I’m not able to hike anymore, so I do this”. Then, as I was finishing errands in town a man saw me with my hiking gear and offered a hitch back to the trailhead. Rides are not always available to help get around when off trail and a break from walking is not always the case when making a town stop, but in some situations they seem to come through just when needed.Not being one to miss a meal, I made a quick pit stop at “The Barn” restaurant when passing through Atkins, VA to try their “Thru-Hiker Burger”. It was a 16 oz double cheese burger and with some slaw on top it was pure bliss. Had a salad and vanilla ice cream on the side and got back on trail with some extra fuel in the tank.Since crossing into Virginia the trail’s water sources have been less frequent and have required more planning and endurance. One particular dry stretch of trail was 19 miles between water sources. In a situation such as this, I have been able to make it through by fully hydrating at the last water source then topping off 3 liters of water containers, consume water in a methodic way during the dry stretch staying just above the “dehydrated level”. Then, after making it through the dry stretch and collecting new water, be sure to have the disipline to properly treat the water before drinking. Despite the challenge of hiking a long distance with less than ideal water, it brings a certain perspective on how essential water is to survival...and how refreshing a simple liter of water can be.On June 16th, I came to the town of Pearisburg, VA for a resupply. Other than the normal resupply chores, I needed to figure out a way to buy a new phone. My old phone had taken a hit after being dropped on the trail and I had been without a working phone since. I ended up taking a shuttle over to Princeton, WV to pickup the phone and managed to get back on trail the same day.Bears are continuing to be a foe along the trail. One night I was awoken to the sound of a bear snooping around outside my tent. I could hear it breathing as it came closer. After clanging my metal spoon and pot together and shouting at the bear, it retreated. At the start of my hike, this intrusion may have kept me awake for the rest of the night, but in this case I was back to sleep a few minutes later. I have seen many more bear along the trail while hiking. Unlike, the smokies the bear in Virginia seem to have the tendency to turn and run away when contact is made with people. When they are not aggressive, sighting them becomes almost enjoyable..got the experience of seeing a Mama with her two cubs on one occasion.On June 19th, I walked into some trail magic at Rocky Gap. There, I met a day hiker with his dog and he was gracious enough to share a cold bottle of India Pale Ale. Thanks go out to that trail angel..the beer and conversation were refreshing.On June 20th, I hiked passed a monument in honor of Medal of Honor Recipient Audie Murphy who is the most decorated soldier of WWII. Murphy was killed after the war in a plane crash on a nearby mountain. A quote at his monument read, “In honor of Audie Murphy, proving that each one of us has the equal opportunity to be unequaled.”On June 22nd, I hiked passed the 3 trail sites that are known as Virginia’s Triple Crown: Dragon’s Tooth (stone monolith), McAfee Knob, and Tinker Cliffs. All the triple crown sites can be day hiked separately, however be advised the trail just north of dragons tooth does require some extra balance and agility to navigate up or down the steep section of trail.I am about to get back on trail in Daleville and hope to hike without a resupply stop for 130 miles to Waynesboro, VA. There isn’t a convenient resupply during this section, so I’ve topped off the pack with 6 days of food. It will be good practice for the 100 mile wilderness in new england.“I went to the woods because I wished to live life deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life...and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.” - Henry David Thoreau","Damascus, VA

Champagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543142,"July 22nd, Mile 1147. The Appalachian Trail is said to be the journey of 5 million steps. By that measure, I’ve taken about 1 million steps since my last update. This last section of trail has brought me to the town of Duncannon in the beautiful state Pennsylvania.As I pushed out of Roanoke, VA, the trail brought me through many a familiar place; all holding good memories. To name a few: Peaks of Otter, Apple Orchard Mountain, Petites Gap, Blue Ridge Parkway, Devil's Marble Yard, James River Foot Bridge, The Priest, and others.On July 1st, I arrived at Rockfish Gap and was chauffeured around Waynesboro, VA for resupply and other errands by my amazing Grandmother. My deepest thanks are in order to her for not only taking care of my every need but serving a top notch spaghetti dinner for me and the many family members who came out to show their support of my thru-hike. Thanks Grandma!On the 4th of July, while in the Shenandoah National Park, I hiked into the evening hours past sunset with the sound of fireworks exploding in the distance. I was rewarded with an overlook to the west at the summit of Hightop Mountain and counted about a dozen separate firework displays across the valley below. On July 7th, I completed the Shenandoah National Park and came into Front Royal, VA. A friend from the area picked me up and I took the following day off for an overdue rest day. Again, having help with the resupply and town errands simplified things and I returned to the trail on the 9th.On July 10th, I passed the 1,000 mile mark. The following day, I completed Virginia and arrived into Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters is located in this small historic town where the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers merge. I checked in with the ATC office, which is considered to be the ‘psychological halfway point’ of the trail. There I had my picture taken for the thru-hiker record book.On July 12th, I crossed over the Potomac River and entered Maryland. The trail passed through a number of historic sites in Maryland, including Civil War battlefields and the first monument built to honor George Washington in 1827. I stopped for a beer at the Old South Mountain Inn, which opened in the mid 1700s and has hosted numerous US Presidents in its time. Sometimes though, the trail provides cold beer, as was the case at Warner Gap. A trail angel had placed an iced cooler of Frederick, Maryland brewed ‘Flying Dog’ beer on the trailside with a note saying, “stay cool hikers!”.On July 15th, I crossed the Mason-Dixon Line and entered Pennsylvania. I managed a quick resupply trip into Waynesboro, PA and fast return to the trail thanks to an abundance of kind locals willing to offer rides. On July 17th, I passed the Birch Run Shelter. It gets my vote for most elaborate and well kept shelter on the trail. It’s solid workmanship included decorative designs, hanging flower baskets, solar clocks, and swinging benches. That afternoon, and 3 months to the day since leaving Springer Mountain, I past the AT midpoint with 1,094.5 miles hiked and 1,094.5 remaining. Leaving a note in the trail register, I wrote, ‘just gettin’ warmed up!’, summing up my spiritual, mental, and physical readiness for the long but gradually dwindling trail left ahead.On July 18th, I passed through Pine Grove Furnace State Park and visited the Appalachian Trail Museum located there. It was an impressive amount of information and displays on the AT’s founding and growing history. In the corner of the museum stood a weathered wooden sign about 6 feet in height that once marked the summit of Mt. Katahdin. The captioned information explained it was replaced in 2010 after 10 years at the AT northern terminus, meaning that it was the sign I saw on my day hike of Katahdin as a 14 year old Boy Scout. My dream of hiking the AT literally began while standing at the sign that was now in front of me as a museum exhibit. What a moral boast it was to unexpectedly come across this relic at the halfway point of my journey. Everyday truly is it's own adventure and you never know what you're going to find.On July 20th, I got an earlier start than usual leaving Boiling Springs, PA. Upon doing some reading ahead in my guidebook I realized that there was a free meal in Duncannon if I could make it there by 7:00pm. The Christ Lutheran Church provides a spaghetti dinner for hikers on Wednesday evenings, so I leaned into the trail with extra motivation and arrived in time for a full course meal. Thank you to the good members at Christ Lutheran for the generosity shown toward me and my fellow hiker brothers and sisters.I have been sitting here on the banks of the Susquehanna River typing this post. The only thing interrupting the tranquil scene surrounding me is a passing freight train about every half-hour. Having completed another successful resupply here in Duncannon, I am ready to hit the trail again. I managed to get my first shower and laundry wash done since Front Royal, VA while in town. A bit longer than I would prefer to go with out getting cleaned up. But hey, I’m thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail..this is the way it’s supposed to be right?“He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.” -Micah 6:8","Roanoke, VA

Champagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546166,"August 18th, Mile 1,478. Yesterday marked my 4th month on trail. The days have been long, but the time has flown by fast. I have made it into New England and am currently on a town stop in Cornwall Bridge, Connecticut. The last few weeks have been one adventure after another; filled with small miracles and big challenges.Soon after leaving Duncannon, PA, I met ‘Iron Butterfly’; a 70 year old woman hiker with perhaps the most fitting of trail names. We had both stopped at a shelter during a rainstorm to dry off for a bit. After speaking with her, I was surprised to learn that she was not on a day hike but thru-hiking! A reminder that challenges are not overcome by ability and strength alone, but it is our inner will to push, strive, and keep going that is key to unlocking potential.On July 28th, I arrived into the small town of Port Clinton and took shelter on the front porch of a post office just before a deluge of rain came down. I rode into the nearby town of Hamburg with a local for a food resupply and haircut. The world’s largest Cabela’s store is in Hamburg, so I stopped in for a look around. Shame I couldn’t buy anything that would fit in my backpack.On July 31st, I made a particularly steep climb up the mountain leaving Lehigh Gap. The last section of the climb became technical and at one point involved tossing my trekking poles over the ledge above and rock climbing over a vertical rock slab. The sense of height was incredible as it was a near straight down view to Lehigh Gap and the river a thousand feet below.Fresh fruit is normally a rare commodity on the trail. However, over the last month Raspberries and Blackberries have been readily available for picking on the trail side. Better than the store bought variety, wild berries have just the right amount of a sweet and sour taste to become slightly addictive. Yet, the summer weather has also brought some less desired changes. Mosquito bites, persistent nats, bee stings, and even snakes have been more prevalent over the last month. The bees have really been doing a number. One sting had my hand swollen to the size of the Michelin Man and another on the ear caused hearing to be affected. Need not worry though, this train has too much momentum to stop for a few bee stings.On August 2nd, I arrived into Delaware Water Gap and spent two nights at the Presbyterian Church of the Mountain Hiker Center. A solid hiker hostel and a good place to shower and have a base of operations for a resupply stopover. One of the church members shuttled me to nearby Stroudsburg for laundry and food resupply. Thank you for your hospitality and 40 years of serving thru-hikers. Upon departing Delaware Water Gap, I crossed into New Jersey on the Delaware River Bridge and completed Pennsylvania.On August 7th, I stopped briefly in Unionville, NY for breakfast and had perhaps my first conflict with the Northern way of life. Ordering a sausage and egg biscuit at a short order breakfast joint, I was sternly corrected. ‘We don’t serve biscuits here, do you mean a sausage and egg hard roll?’; I chuckled at the mistake and cautiously accepted the yankee hard roll version. Later that day, after continuing down trail, I hiked through two of New Jersey’s flat sections. Yes, New Jersey has mountains and some fairly high and pristine ones at that. The Wallkill Reserve was a relatively flat section as well as the popular boardwalk over a swamp near Vernon, NJ. Both spots offered a welcome break from the normal up and down elevation changes. On August 8th, I completed New Jersey and crossed the state border into New York. Soon thereafter, I made a stop at Bellvale Farms Creamery and enjoyed a tasty banana split and root beer. The decision whether to have another banana split or get back to the trail wasn’t easy.Over the past couple weeks, northbound (Nobo) thru-hikers have begun to meet their southbound (Sobo) counterparts. Starting in June and July Sobos start at Mt. Katahdin, Maine and thru-hike south to Georgia. One day while climbing a mountain that is also a popular day hike spot, I had stopped to talk with a local couple about my thru-hike. Their expressions of disbelief that someone would walk from Georgia to Maine grew when a group of Sobos happened to come through and introduced themselves. I jokingly said, ‘yeah, I’m walking to where they came from and they’re walking to where I came from’. The local couple nearly fainted.On August 9th, I resupplied in Monroe. I had looked ahead in the trail guidebook and not seen any decent resupply options ahead. Rather than skimp on food, I decided it was best to find a way into Monroe. A local quickly pulled over on the highway and offered a ride into town and I was back on trail that evening.On August 10th, I experienced the ‘Lemon Squeezer’. It’s basically a narrowing passageway between two rock faces that’s not too daunting so long as the hiker and pack fit through the passage. Immediately following the Lemon Squeezer, was the toughest 10 feet of the trail so far. The white blazes went over a 10-12 foot rock face with an alternate ‘easy way’ path around it. It required rock climbing to get over. Foot and hand holds where almost non-existent. After looking it over, I lifted my pack and poles over my head and onto the ledge above. Then, standing on a 2 foot ground rock, I stepped with my right foot into a slight indentation on the side of the giant boulder hoping that would hold my weight as I brought my left leg up. The only place for my left foot was the ledge of the boulder a good 3-4 feet above my right foot. Trying to balance perfectly, I stretched my left leg up as far as it would go and got the toe of my boot onto the ledge. Then working my boot left and right, I got more boot on the ledge and pulled myself over. Not sure I was ready for that challenging of a rock climb but I made it. Part of my motivation for the trail ahead comes from the confidence of having walked every step of the trail so far. In this instance, I could have taken the ‘easy way’, but robbed myself of hiking the whole trail. Food for thought: What if the purpose of the rest of the trail is to prepare you for and get you to the hardest parts?On August 11th, while hiking for a stretch with a fellow Nobo, we got to meet a trail angel who thru-hiked in 1980. The trail angel called over to us from a nearby rock ledge where he was sitting and offered us a cold beer. As we talked with the gentleman, he explained today’s thru-hikers have it easy because back when he hiked a map and compass were required to get from one section of marked trail to the next. He lamented not being able to hike as he used to, but enjoys doing trail magic and supporting his children who are in the process of thru-hiking. After spending some time with the trail angel, I finished climbing Bear Mountain and found a place to pitch my tent. As dusk descended on the landscape around Bear Mountain, scattered thunderstorms came through the area. After the storms passed, the lights of the New York City skyline came into view. At about 30 miles away, the skyline was relatively small; almost appearing ghost like on the horizon. The following morning, I descended Bear Mountain on a superbly built section of trail, which included over a thousand 1 ton rock steps placed perfectly into position. At the base, I crossed over the Hudson River on Bear Mountain Bridge.The weekend of August 13th and 14th was particularly hot. The high temperatures and high humidity combined to produce a heat index of 110 Saturday. Several of these days the heat forced a break in hiking during mid-day to stay cool. The days since have been improving with temps bearable in the 80s and 90s. The cool weather will be here soon as I go northward and Autumn approaches. During one of these hot days I broke a trekking pole, which has been my only equipment break of the hike. Fortunately, I was able to order a replacement part for the section that broke and should be back in business soon. In the meantime, I have been getting by fine hiking with a single pole and am still able to pitch my tent which uses trekking poles as it’s support frame.On August 16th, I entered the gateway of New England as I finished New York and crossed into Connecticut. The following day, I resupplied in the town of Kent and then continued down trail making it into Cornwall Bridge at nightfall. I spent the night at the Cornwall Hitching Post Motel where I had a new pair of boots delivered. It was good being able to get my first shower and laundry done since Delaware Water Gap. My new pair of Lowas feel great. After 1,500 miles, it was time to retire the first pair. The Renegades have served me exceptionally well and I’m sure the replacements will see me through to the finish.Aside from scribing this journal entry my only other order of business before returning to trail was to check in with the Cornwall Package Store. This store has a reputation preceding it on the trail. Upon signing their hiker logbook, you are offered 1 free pick of over a hundred varieties of beer. I chose a light Mexican made beer to try and got a fun picture standing outside the store with my prize. I hope the Sol cerveza tastes good warm, because this journal entry has taken a minute to write.“We are stronger than we think; we are able to persevere longer than we ever thought we could. It’s inside each of us - the spirit to endure. The question really is: how badly do we want to work for it?” -Police Lieutenant Brian Murphy","Duncannon, PA

Champagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549789,"September 28th. Mile 1891. An intriguing mileage number to be stopped on here in Gorham, New Hampshire. 1891 is the Troop number of which I am an Eagle Scout Alum and as a 14 year old Scout aspired to thru-hike the AT. Also, change the 1 in the thousands place to a 2 and move the last 1 to the hundreds place and you have 2,189; the trail’s total mileage. An auspicious sign? Perhaps so. Being on the verge of the last state border, I’ll take a bit of good superstition. On August 19th, I returned to the trail from Cornwall Bridge, CT. The following day I surpassed 1,500 total miles of hiking since starting the trail. On August 21st I completed Connecticut and crossed into the second state of New England; Massachusetts.On August 24th, I camped at the trail side home of a trail angel known as the ‘Cookie Lady’ who welcomes hikers to her blueberry farm for a respite from the trail. I arrived after nightfall and pitched my tent in a grassy clearing illuminated by the moon and stars. In the morning, I enjoyed hard boiled farm eggs, fresh picked blueberries, and homemade oatmeal cookies. Hikers are invited to help with a farm chore to cover their overnight stay, so I helped by watering plants around the house before returning to the trail. Later in the day, I came to the town of Dalton where I planned to resupply and spend the night. Here, I was lucky enough to have the help of two more trail angels. After grabbing a steak and cheese ‘grinder’, trail angel Cindy graciously provided a ride to the grocery store in Pittsfield for a food resupply. And upon returning to Dalton, I checked in with a trail angel by the name of Tom who makes available the use of his porch and backyard to thru-hikers overnighting in town. After a good night's rest, Tom served breakfast and hot coffee to about a dozen of us and offered tips on the next section of trail. On August 27th, I completed Massachusetts and crossed into Vermont. The AT is concurrent with the Vermont ‘Long Trail’ for about 100 miles, beginning at the state line. The origin of the AT is in part due to the earlier developed Long Trail.I’m often asked, by section hikers and locals along my journey, ‘what’s your favorite part so far?’. Answering this question can be tough because my thru-hike experience has been a collection of small personal moments not necessarily tied to a literal section of the trail. However, some spots on the trail will grab you and cause a ‘wow’ moment. One such place was Glastenbury Mountain. On August 29th, as I neared the summit of Glastenbury, the trail became perfectly quiet; any sounds being absorbed by the dense forest of fir trees. A fire tower stands atop the mountain, which must be climbed to gain a lookout view. As I ascended the tower’s stairwell the wind increased as I broke above the treetops. The view opens up and a stunning panorama is offered. With the exception of a group of windmills in the distance, no trace of civilization can be seen in any direction. As a northbounder, this was the first such view of uninterrupted wilderness and left a distinct impression upon me.Another exceptional lookout came two days later. On August 31st, I summited Stratton Mountain and soaked in another stunning panorama from atop it’s lookout tower. It was from this location, in 1921, Benton MacKaye was inspired to propose creation of the A.T. At the time, construction of the Vermont Long Trail was in progress and as MacKaye stood on Stratton he further expanded the Long Trail concept into a footpath linking all the scenic ridges of the Appalachian range. The AT was completed over a decade later in 1937. On September 1st, I made a resupply stop in Manchester Center and picked up a couple packages waiting for me at the post office. I had been without use of one of my trekking poles since New York. So with the replacement part recieved, I was finally back in business with both poles in operation. On September 5th, I finished the Long Trail section as it breaks away from the AT and meanders north to the Canadian border. Also that day I crossed below the 500 mile point to Mt. Katahdin. Let the countdown begin! On September 5th, I made a brief detour into the town of Killington for a light resupply. I visited the town convenience store which included a short order deli. After enjoying chili soup and a salad for lunch, I grabbed several food items to supplement my pack reserves and hopped back on trail. On September 8th, I wrapped up Vermont and crossed into New Hampshire; entering the town of Hanover for a resupply stopover. Hanover is home to Ivy League school Dartmouth College and is the town's main economic driver. The trail runs directly through Hanover and as I came into town it became a challenge to follow the white AT blazes as the streets and sidewalks were a flurry of activity with students returning to campus for ‘move in’ week. After finding the grocery store and resupplying, I met up with other hikers at a pizza joint for dinner. We must have been a sight to see with our hiking attire and backpacks, all seated at a patio table surrounded by high class Dartmouth students! After dinner, I pitched my tent at a campsite just beyond the outfield of the Dartmouth baseball stadium. In the morning I got a breakfast fit for a king at Lou’s diner and returned to the trail for my first day in New Hampshire.The White Mountain National Forest, otherwise known as ‘The Whites’ have a reputation for being the most challenging section of the AT. While I consider no part of the AT to be easy, The Whites are truly a different animal. Extreme weather conditions, rugged terrain, sparse trail blazes, above treeline areas, and spectacular views are a few elements that make it a unique place. That said, the whites are nothing that cannot be overcome. In one important way, the whites are no different than the rest of the trail. Which is, it all comes down to doing what is right in front of you! On September 13th, I entered the heart of the whites and summited Mt. Moosilauke (4,802’), which offered a view of the entire mountain range I would cross in the whites. Mt. Washington towered in the far distance. On September 14th, I climbed up and over Kinsman Mountain. The ascent up South Kinsman was the most difficult section of the entire trail in my opinion. Faced over and over with enormous slabs of rock that interrupted the steep trail, hiking turned into rock climbing in many cases. This terrain, combined with a rainy day, made for an exceptional challenge unlike any I had yet come across. On September 15th, I stopped in North Woodstock to resupply and overnight. After checking into a motel room, I walked about a mile to the neighboring town of Lincoln to resupply on food. Later, I cleaned up with a hot shower and washed clothes at a nearby laundromat. The following morning, September 16th, I returned to trail and summited the first of the Presidential Mountains traversed by the AT. Upon hiking north out of North Woodstock, I broke out above treeline and hiked for several miles along Franconia Ridge. Mt. Lincoln (5,089’) and Mt. Lafayette (5,263’) are summited along this ridgeline hike that offers a continuous panoramic view. To use a New Hampshire phrase, the views from Franconia Ridge were ‘wicked good!’ and probably my favorite spot of the whites. During a lunch break on top of Mt. Lafayette, I met a Geologist from Boston College collecting rock samples from various boulders. He had received permission to collect samples at numerous mountain peaks in the whites in an effort to learn more about how glaciers receded from the area years ago. Evidently, this sampling is rare so being able to see it in progress was neat. On September 17th, I celebrated my 5th month on trail and hit three separate four thousand foot peaks: Mt. Garfield (4,458’), South Twin Mountain (4,902’), and Mt. Guyot (4,580’). On September 18th, I met the family of ‘Special K’; a 14 year old girl thru-hiker. You can follow Special K, one of the AT’s youngest thru-hikers, on her blog: https://atjourneyblog.wordpress.com. On September 20th, I was above treeline for the entire day as I made my way up Mt. Washington and over the neighboring Presidential summits. The day included the tops of: Mt. Pierce (4,312’), Mt. Franklin (5,004’), Mt. Washington (6,288’). Other Presidentials were skirted over but not summited by the AT. Mt. Washington is the 2nd highest point of elevation above sea level on the AT; below Clingman’s Dome in Tennessee. However, Washington feels higher when standing atop due to the greater elevation relief to the mountain base below. While the towering mountain was impressive, I prefer views that are closer to the surrounding terrain because much greater detail can be seen and felt. Later, as a setting sun dipped below the horizon, I arrived to the Madison Spring Hut to inquire about a work-for-stay for the night. A work-for-stay is a program offered by the Appalachian Mountain Club operated Hut locations in which thru-hikers are ‘hired’ to do miscellaneous chores around the lodge in exchange for a meal and a place to sleep indoors. Fortunately, when I arrived they were in need of help and accepted me for the work-for-stay. This was clutch, because I was above treeline (no camping), it would soon be nightfall, and the high winds were bringing an overcast cloud deck into the area. Inside, the hut was buzzing with the activity of a large youth group that were the paid guests. After the guests finished dinner, which is prepared and served to guests every evening, I was invited to finish the lasagna leftovers with staff members. Then, as part of my work, I deep cleaned stainless steel pans with a wire brush for the hut’s upcoming end of season equipment inspections. Around 10:00 PM, the guests retreated to their private quarters and I was able to spread out on the common room floor to catch some sleep. The next morning, on September 21st, I ate breakfast at the hut, scrubbed some more pans, and got back on trail. That day, I summited Mt. Madison (5,366’) and made it down to Pinkham Notch with enough food reserves to go another 20 miles before making a resupply stop. On September 24th, I got off trail at Rattle River for a town stop in Gorham. Maine lies a short distance ahead now, so I’ve taken several days to rest, resupply, and take a breath before starting the final stretch. The quiet town of Gorham has been an ideal place to rest. It includes a well run hiker hostel named ‘The Barn’, which is literally just that. A converted barn, complete with a front sliding style door, is annexed to a separately run Bed and Breakfast house. Many good eateries dot the townscape which I have made good use of in order to keep sufficient meat on my bones. Gorham has taken good care of my trail weary body and helped me prep for the remaining miles.With the recent start of Autumn, I have now been on the AT through 3 seasons. The milder daytime temperatures and the chilly nights are a welcome relief from the high heat and humidity experienced not long ago while hiking through Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. The leaves are now turning color in earnest and the mountains are becoming ever more beautiful with contrasting colors of yellow, orange, and red mixed with the unchanging evergreen fir trees. And speaking of the mountains! One aspect of the whites that I distinctly appreciated was the opportunity to look back on where I had hiked from earlier in the day or the day prior. Much of the AT limits one to looking ahead or behind to about 50 yards due to trees and foliage. However, the whites present you with many places in which you can stand at one point and look back to a mountain peak you were on 2 hours ago or retrace your steps from the previous day’s entire hike. I always found the look back to be fascinating in this way. In part because I could intimately remember what it felt like to be on top of the last summit with its all consuming sensations or looking back on a day’s worth of hiking that carries with it a story. Many debate what makes a good view, but my experience as a thru-hiker is that the best views are the ones that have become part of you; because you’ve lived them.“It doesn’t interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for - and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart’s longing. It doesn’t interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool - for love - for your dreams - for the adventure of being alive.”-Oriah Mountain Dreamer","Cornwall Bridge, CT

Champagne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551383,"To all who have followed my A.T. Thru-Hike here on Trail Journals, Thank you! Your interest inspired and fueled me along the way more than you realize. I am off trail now; safe, and enjoying the comforts of home.
The success of this journal has been a surprise. It has served the magnificent purpose of allowing me to share my adventure with you; if only in pieces. The routine of journaling profoundly enriched my thru-hike experience. With each chapter written I was re-energized to begin the next section of trail. To those who signed the guestbook, your comments were among my greatest rewards.
It is my pleasure to announce that I have decided to explore writing a book on my thru-hike. You read it here first! For now, I will keep my previous eleven journal entries active for all to read. I plan to begin part-time work on the book idea going forward; progressing as my schedule allows. Stay patient for the next part of this amazing journey.
