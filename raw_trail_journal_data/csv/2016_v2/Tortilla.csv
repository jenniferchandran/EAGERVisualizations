Tortilla,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522580,"The day is finally here! It is approximately 3:30 am, I am in my bed in Hayden Alabama and my mom and dad will be driving my friend Evan Smith and I to amnicola falls around 4:30 am. I'm up a little early because honestly I can not sleep, I was not anticipating feeling this nervous but I guess when this type of adventure begins to become a reality it starts to sink in, right at the bottom of my gut. I am visualizing every piece of gear in my pack and thinking it all needs to be thrown out in order to save weight, I've been constantly thinking about all the preparation that has been done to this point and how it is not enough, my mind of course takes me to the worst places and I find myself thinking that I'm completely insane and should not be doing something like this. I know this is just the pre-trail jitters that everyone is experiencing, right? It will all be better once I'm moving towards Maine. Today's game plan is to hike the approach trail and then approximately 2 miles on the actual AT and stop at Stovers creek shelter and campsite. Evans brother Michael is going to join us at springer mountain. In about 2-3 days we will be at Neels gap, and the rest has yet to be planned. I hope you enjoy following my journey on the Appalachain Trail. If you're In the area come and hike with us. *proof reading kinda happens as I type, please forgive my spelling and grammar mistakes, I'm probably in a tent on my iPhone and it's likely raining. -Ben","Amnicola Falls approach trail

Tortilla,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522956,"Hello everyone! I'm sorry I have not been posting more, I been adjusting to trail life and just have not thought about it. Last night myself and 4 other hikers rented a cabin at Blood Mountain Cabins, it is located right beside the trail and Neels Gap. It was very nice to wash clothes, shower and sleep on a bed, or in my case a couch. So far the hiking has been great, the past 40 miles have not been too bad, my body has held up well with the exception of soreness which is standard. The trail has been pretty crowded so far, I have met a lot of people which is nice. Evan and I have made a habit of leaving camp early in order to secure a spot in the next campsite, that strategy has proven successful. The weather has been great, I am very appreciative of it but I know it's going to be raining soon and I'm ready to get that first rainy day and night over with, I'm tired of anticipating it. Today we are going to low gap shelter which is about 11 miles from here, for the next week or so we plan on moving along at 10-15 miles a day, that will put us at the Nantahala Outdoor center on the weekend of March 18, we will take a zero day there. Some friends and family may be coming to visit me and I am really looking forward to that. We are about to head out for the day, I truly appreciate the support and prayers from you all! I hope you can come hike with us sometime. Happy trails my friendsBen(Don't have a trail name yet)","Neels Gap

Tortilla,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524059,"Hello everyone! I'm sorry it has been so long since I have updated my journal. One of my goals was to write daily and share it on here as much as possible, I have failed so far. Anyway, I am at the NOC for the weekend, we arrived early Friday morning and have stayed around since. The rest has been much needed and I hope it will pay off in the coming days. Mom, dad and Amy have came up this weekend to visit and I have really loved that, the amount of food they have brought is unbelievable! It's been very relaxing and refreshing to visit with them. So far the hike has been wonderful, the weather has been great and my body has held up, no blisters to report and just a little soreness. Starting this week we will have a long climb out of NOC and then hit the smokies shortly after, the smokies have been one section I have most looked forward too. I have spent a lot of time in the smokies and I am very excited to visit it again as a thru hiker. We have developed a pretty great trail family, although some of them have kept hiking on this weekend I hope to catch up with them soon. Oh I almost forgot! I have been given a trail name! Haha, it is ""Tortilla"". A few days ago, leprechaun, sparks, Zoe and myself were at wesser bald fire tower, the weather was great so we decided to stop and eat lunch. Since we would be at the NOC the next day I was going to eat basically everything I had left, I went for the tuna but I did not have a tortilla to eat it with, it's just better on a tortilla. I knew leprechaun did not have one, I asked sparks and he did not either, Zoe also gave me the bad news. And suddenly out of the corner of my eye I saw something in a tree, it was similar looking to a tortilla, after further inspection it turned out to be a tortilla! I fished that baby out of the tree, put some tuna on it and had lunch! (I promise I am not making this up!) Sparks was so amazed he said it had to be my trail name. So just like that I was no longer Ben, and became Tortilla. It was an exciting day. Tomorrow we begin hiking again, even though it be the first day spring the weather will be far from spring like. I'm hoping the weather stays decent for us. Another concern of mine is the sudden outbreak of the norovirus that has been reported at Fontana Dam shelter. The norovirus is basically a 48 hour stomach virus and somewhat easy to catch. So my prayers are that I don't end up with that! I am going to try my best to update this more in the future! Until next time, happy trails my friends! -Tortilla","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Tortilla,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524862,"After a very nice weekend at the NOC (in NC) we hiked out on Sunday, March 20th. It was the first day of spring! But it sure did not feel like it. We made the 7 mile climb from the NOC to Sassafras Gap shelter, as I was getting to the shelter it was beginning to snow. I was very thankful to see that some other hikers already had a fire going! It was very nice to get warm before going to bed. It was the coldest night we have had so far and we woke up to about 2 inches of snow. That day we hiked 15.2 miles to Cable Gap shelter, it was a cold day, but we were able to keep warm by hiking. That night Leprechaun, Zoe and myself had the shelter to ourselves. We had a nice fire and I had my first mountain house meal that my mom and dad had given me. It was wonderful! (Thanks mom and dad!) The next day we got a late start and walked a short 5.5 miles into Fontana Village. We went to the lodge to get something to eat, I had a blackened chicken taco salad and it was awesome! We met a man at the restaurant that had driven down from Nashville looking for his son who had gotten sick at Mollies Ridge Shelter, which is the first shelter you get to after Fontana, and was there to pick him up, that kinda startled us and we decide to stay the night at the lodge and get an early start the next day and hike past that shelter. We left Fontana Village on Wednesday. The weather was perfect all day, we ended up going 15 miles into the Smokies and staying the night at Russel Field shelter. It was very windy that night but the shelter was air tight, so we got were able to get some rest. We woke up that morning to 45 degree temps and a lot of wind. It was one of those days where you can't find a balance between cold and too hot! So I ended up sweating most of the day and freezing when I stopped hiking. But we did hike over ""Rocky Top"" (and, yes, I sang Rammer Jammer atop Rocky Top - Roll Tide!) and ""Thunderhead Mtn"". Those are two spots in the Smokies I have often heard of and have never been to. It was cold and windy but the view was still great! It was another 15 mile day but we were able to make it to Siler Bald shelter right before freezing rain and high winds set in. We ate dinner and quickly claimed spots in the shelter. We have a ridge runner here tonight and she let us listen to the weather channel on her radio, it looks as though the rain will be gone in the morning and it could be a nice weekend. That is what I am praying for!The wind and rain was gone this morning! It was a very pleasant hike to Clingmans Dome and then down to Newfound Gap. Our friend from college, Keith, met us at Clingmans and we hiked back to his truck at Newfound Gap and we came down to Gatlinburg to resupply and eat. As always it will be nice to get some good hot food to eat. Tomorrow we will head back into the Smokies and we should finish this section soon. The Smoky Mountains have not disappointed at all, it has been a beautiful hike and I am very excited to see the second half! I appreciate all of your prayers and support! I will check back in soon!","Natahalla Outdoor Center

Tortilla,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525804,"On Saturday March 26 we woke up in Gatlinburg, went and had some pancakes and then headed back to the trail. It was pretty crowded from Newfound Gap all the way to Charlie's Bunion. The weather was slightly overcast but it was still a very nice day to hike. We had several great views on our way to Pecks Corner. Upon arrival at the shelter we found it to be full and most all of the tent sites to be claimed. After some some searching we all found a place to pitch our tents. We had dinner and then retired to our quarters for some rest. We woke up to a very foggy and overcast morning with a 12 mile hike to Cosby Knob ahead of us. Keith and I started our hike at about 8am. After walking the half mile back to the AT Keith went back south to his vehicle and I continued north. It was great having a new face to hike with for a few day's. It was pretty cloudy and somewhat rainy all day so I just hiked and did not stop much at all, I made it to Cosby Knob shelter around 1pm and enjoyed the company of around 10-12 other hikers. A crowded shelter on the last night in the Smokies seemed appropriate since they have all been crowded for the 4 nights we were there. A thunderstorm woke us up around 5am, luckily it stopped around daylight. It was a very cloudy and cold morning but as I got lower in elevation the weather really turned around and it was a beautiful hike down to Davenport Gap. At the Gap we were treated with some trail magic - hot dogs, soda, chips, fruit and candy! It was a treat and gave us plenty of energy to continue for a few more miles to Painters Branch campsite. The campsite was near a beautiful creek with a great view of the Smoky Mountains we had just left that morning. The following day we hiked over to Max's Patch. The weather was perfect and I spent the better part of 3 hours on top of Max's Patch with about 10 other hikers laying in the sun and taking in the amazing views. Just before sunset I made a quick two mile hike to Roaring Fork shelter where I stayed for the night. The following morning we hiked 11 miles to Garenflo Gap. At the Gap Leprechaun's parents picked us up and took us to a cabin they rented. We took a zero day today and tomorrow we are going to do some slack packing. We will stay here again tomorrow night and leave out on Saturday. It's been great to rest and relax here! I am looking forward to getting back on the trail and making our way north. Soon we will be entering Virginia, which has the more trail miles than any other state on the AT (544 miles). Everything is great, my body is holding up and I am loving the adventure! I will check back with everyone later. Thanks again for your prayers and support. Happy trails. -Tortilla","NOC - Gatlinburg, TN

Tortilla,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528013,"Well I have made it to Virginia! It is exciting and scary. Scary in a way that we have more miles to hike in this state than we have hiked so far! But that's ok, it's all part of the journey to Maine. The weather has been wonderful for 95% of the trail. We've had 2 or 3 days of light rain, 1 or 2 snow storms with low temperatures but the rest has really been nice and sunny. I have gotten my trail legs in the sense that it's not uncommon to hike 15-16 miles before 2-3pm everyday, but I am still fighting off pains in my hips, knees and feet - really my lower body all together. But that is to be expected and a few days rest will help. I have met a lot of new people in the last week or so, it's nice to expand the trail family. Just to give you a sense of some crazy trail names ill rattle off a few: Leprechaun, Captain America, The Hare, Top Knot, Flicker, Rambo, Massasoit, Teach, Fireman, Forrest, Sparky, Hong Kong Steve, Steve the hiker, Volunteer, Oats, Tinder, M&M, Sherpa crow, Napster, River, Shaggy, Cricket, Wiki, and Shiver. I'm sure I'm missing some, but that gives you a good idea of the names people go by out here, and it's interesting to hear how they get their names. Everything is going well. I am having fun, even if every day is a brutal fight to get to my next destination. I am looking forward to Virginia and all the sights and sounds it has to offer. Shortly after Virginia I will have reached the half way point! That sounds crazy when I say it out loud because it feels like we have come so far already!

Tortilla,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529587,"I decided to do something different for this journal entry and make a short synopsis of every day since my last entry. Hope you like it. 4-16-16Today we left from Damascus. The weather was wonderful and we hung out around town with friends for most of the day. We left town around 3pm. I was feeling good so I hiked about 10 miles out to a campsite next to a pond. A few people are here and it is nice to have to company. I am a little sore and I am having some pain in my left hip, my upper left leg is feeling numb also. I am not sure what is causing it, I am going to play around with how I synch my hip belt and how I wear my pack, maybe that will help. 4-17-16I left the campsite on the pond around 9:15 am. I did not feel rushed because I knew I was only going about 16 miles and it was going to be a beautiful day. I took my time making a few big climbs. I enjoyed some music and podcasts most of the day. I arrived at Thomas Knob shelter around 6pm, the view from this shelter was amazing (see photos), there were also several wild ponies around (again, see photos), it was a very cool place to call home for a night. 4-18-16I didn't leave camp any earlier today! The weather was perfect today and we really just took our time enjoying the Grayson Highlands! The terrain here is like nothing I have ever been in, it is what I imagine it's like out West - wide open spaces, short shrub like trees, and mountains not far away. If you can get away for a weekend I really recommend a visit here. We stopped at a shelter around lunch and Leprechaun and I got out our baseball gloves and tossed a little. It did not take long to find a stick to use as a bat and then a few of us played some baseball! It was a lot of fun and the stick worked surprisingly well. We hiked on 6 more miles to a shelter where we stopped for tonight. Beautiful tent spots on a beautiful night! 4-19-16 I left camp around 8:30 this morning. The plan was to only go 16 miles to a camp spot. We really took our time today, even hung out at a stream trying to catch trout for awhile. We arrived to the location we thought was supposed to be camp but we did not find any flat spots with water near by. So after some discussion we decided to continue on 5 more miles to Partnership shelter. It was packed, probably because it is next to a visitor center and you can order pizza to be delivered! We had some pizza and then cowboy camped outside of the shelter. It was a great day. 4-20-16We caught shuttle to Marion, Va first thing this morning so that we could resupply. Had some McDonald's breakfast and headed back to the trail. I had a very nice and relaxing day of only 7 miles. Since I bought way to much food and my pack weighed a lot, 7 miles was a good amount. We have 7 people here at the shelter tonight. Weather is great and so am I. 4-21-16Woke up feeling terrible today! Stomach nausea and very tired. Unfortunately Leprechaun felt the same way. We limped 5 miles to Atkins Virginia and got a hotel room. After a half days rest and a full nights sleep in a bed we both felt very tired and like a truck had hit us. So we decided to stay and extra day. It's no fun being sick on the trail and it's especially no fun being stuck in a hotel room for a day and a half! I hope to feel better enough to hike tomorrow. Fingers crossed. Update by Jeremiah: Ben did not feel better the next day until late so he stayed 1 more night and finally hit the trail again on Sunday morning. He is very tired and weak today so pray for energy and endurance as he continues.","Damascus, VA

Tortilla,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531488,"4-24-16We got back on the trail today, after 3 nights in a hotel I was ready to be back in the woods. My body probably was not ready though, I was very low on energy and strength. I was able to hike around the same pace and still got in about 13 miles, but it was a struggle for me. We are camping at a nice little spot beside a creek. I had enough of an appetite to have a pack of ramen noodles, after that I was full. I am hoping to get back to full strength soon. 4-25-16Today kicked my butt. Thankful to be in bed now. 4-26-16Today was a much better day. We only hiked around 13 miles and took our time getting there. I still do not have an appetite for anything in my pack, so about 2.5 miles from our destination was a road that lead to Bland, Virginia. We hitched a ride to town and ate at Dairy Queen! I had a bacon cheeseburger and some fries followed with an ice cream sundae. It did the trick and kicked my energy levels back up! The shelter was nice and we had a great couple of tent spots set up outside. A little thunderstorm came through but it was nothing major. 4-27-16Today was another great day! It was mostly cloudy and about 75 degrees with humidity around 100% I'd say. I was soaked in sweat all day but was in high spirits and my energy level were back to normal. Once again we had a place to eat about two miles from our destination - Trent's grocery. It is a hole in the wall gas station that sells everything from ammo to chicken sandwiches. I had the sandwich, and it was quite tasty! We are camped near a river in a valley, everything is wet and it sounds like more storms tonight, this is what being wet all the time feels like. But that's ok, we'll dry out soon enough.4-28-16We had a 13 mile day to get to Woods Hole Hostel today. The hostel is about 1/2 mile from the trail and has been in operation for 33 years! It is truly an amazing place with beautiful scenery, great food, and one of the best smoothies I've ever had! We stayed here for the night with several other hikers that we have known before today. It was a great experience and I would love to visit again someday. 4-29-16We left Woods Hole Hostel and walked 11 miles to Pearisburg, Va. The weather was perfect today so we really took our time and stopped at every scenic overlook for at least 30 minutes. We had to go into town to resupply, and water sources were scarce for a few miles outside of town so we decided to get a cheap motel room for the night and start fresh in the morning. We enjoyed a large Mexican dinner tonight, I am stuffed but happy! 4-30-16Woke up to a very overcast day today. It looked like it would start raining any second. We decided to hike 21 miles to a place called ""The Captains"". The Captains is a mans property right beside the trail and he welcomes hikers to camp out on his lawn, he also provides free soft drinks! That was a real treat. Shortly after arriving we started to cook dinner but rain came in and forced us to the back porch, which was a life saver for sure. It has rained hard all night and is still raining this morning. Looks like it's going to be a very wet week. 5-1-16And just like that the rain stopped and the sun came out. The weather was great today, and we had some great scenery. We only hiked 11 miles because we had heard a lot of people are going to the next shelter so we wanted to stop early so that we could sleep in the shelter and out of the rain that was forecasted tonight. We also had some locals ride mini bikes up the trail and to the shelter tonight. It was a little strange and they were pretty rough around the edges. They let one of the guys here ride the mini bike, he really enjoyed that haha. We are settled in for the night and headed to bed early. 5-2-16Woke up to another beautiful day and left camp around 8:30 am. We had planned to hike to Niday Shelter, 18.2 miles away. It was a great hike and the last 7 miles were a part that I have done before. It was nice to relive those memories. The only issue we had was that a bad thunderstorm came in when we were up on an exposed ridge line and about 4 miles from the shelter. After hiding under a rock over hang we made a dash for the shelter. We ended up catching back up with the storm and getting soaking wet, but luckily not struck by lightning! Now I am hoping that my clothes dry out before tomorrow morning. 5-3-16Today was another short day, only ten miles to Pickle Branch Shelter. The weather was great and I got to hike with some guys I hadn't hiked with in several weeks. After some conversation with one friend from Georgia we found out his girlfriend lives in the same subdivision on the same lake as my sister in law, Lauren's parents, small world. The only climb of the day ended at the Audie Murphy monument. Murphy crashed an airplane near the summit of the mountain in 1971 and died in the crash. He was a true American hero, unlike some of the hikers in camp tonight who after finding a spider in the shelter all left and went to their tents, I've never seen adults so afraid of a spider. But at least I have the shelter to myself. I am going to sleep now, looking forward to climbing the Dragons Tooth tomorrow. 5-4-16The weather was great today and we were able to climb all the way to the peak of the Dragons Tooth, it was a little nerve racking but the view was amazing. We hiked 2 more miles to a place called 4 Pines Hostel, it's a mans garage with several cots and couches. It's a pretty entertaining place for sure. The owner was telling me he has a really good friend from Hayden Alabama, but he can't remember his real name, only his trail name. And he also claims his little dog came from Hayden - again, small world huh. This is my second journal entry I've done like this. I hope you all like this format, I and trying to be more creative and write about some of the exciting/ strange things that happen out here. I have also thought that some of you may have questions for me, if that's the case then just write the questions on the guest book here and I'll be sure to answer as many as I can.

Tortilla,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534132,"When I last updated my journal we were leaving Four Pines Hostel in Catawba, Virginia. We've been doing some bigger mile days and I haven't been feeling well - a bad combination for taking notes every night. Last Sunday on Mother's Day my parents came up to meet us in Buchanan, Virginia. We got a hotel room and enjoyed a great meal of moms cooking! For the next three days we slack-packed and mom and dad did trail magic. A lot of my friends were the lucky recipients of the magic and it has made me very popular haha! I thoroughly enjoyed the days of walking without a heavy pack, sleeping indoors, all the food and drinks I could ever want, and of course spending some time with mom, dad and Murphy! It was a great week. Mom and dad went back home on Thursday and we continued north towards the Shenandoah National Park. Just before entering the park we met a friend of Leprechauns close to Charlottesville and we went back to town with him. He gave us a place to sleep and shower and we have a great breakfast before returning to trail. We did an easy 14 miles to a shelter and then the next morning we entered the Shenandoahs! My next journal entry will chronicle my time in the Shenandoah national park. To answer some questions from my last journal entry: Uncle check, I've lost about 25-30 pounds, it sounds like a lot but luckily I had it to lose.  Mr. Trent, I feel great about every new 100 mile mark we cross, I always feel like that's a great accomplishment but I know we have a lot more to do. As far as schedule goes, I feel great with our pace, we aren't killing ourselves but we also aren't wasting much time. Once again, thanks for reading and your support. We should finish the National Park section in a few days and I will have another entry then.","

Tortilla,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535409,"Well the Shenandoahs (Shenandoah National Park) were great! The trail through the park is very well maintained and the climbs are smooth and not very steep - it was the kind of hiking I could get used too. The wildlife was also out and about; I saw too many deer to count and 4 black bears, it was very exciting. Another perk of hiking through the park is what they call ""waysides"" which is just a restaurant very near to the trail. Most every night we had dinner there and breakfast at more than one, it was a nice treat to not eat camp food for awhile. I also got new shoes at this time, I hitched a ride to Luray, Virginia where my shoes were shipped too. I put at least 950 trail miles on my first pair and was very pleased with them so I ordered the same kind again. Our last morning of the Shenandoah National Park rain came in and it rained pretty steadily for 2 days. By the second day we were soaking wet and sick and tired of rain for sure. Luckily for us on the third day it cleared up and we dried out a bit. That night I stayed at Bears Den Hostel. It is a very old stone house that looks like a castle. Inside is renovated and very comfortable. For $30 I got a bed, laundry, a shower, 1 large pizza and a pint of Ben and Jerrys ice cream. It was a great night to say the least. The following day I hiked 20 miles into Harper's Ferry, Virginia, which is considered by most as the half way point. It may not be halfway by the mileage but it is mentally halfway. I went to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and signed in as the 287th northbound hiker to come through this year, I was hiker #389 when I started the trail. Zoe's parents came and picked up, myself, leprechaun, Zoe and two friends of ours named Riptide and Hawk. They had rented a cabin for a few days and we enjoyed three nights in a bed and two zero days. Not to mention all of the fantastic food they served us! We returned to the trail today, it was very hot but the terrain was forgiving. We are in a shelter tonight with a very strange day hiker. I'm hoping he stops talking soon so we can get some sleep.

Tortilla,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537116,"5-28-16Our second day in Maryland started at 6am. We decided to leave early to beat some of the heat, I must say I thoroughly enjoyed hiking in the cool morning hours and it will become a regular occurrence. Hawk, Riptide and I were making our way to the Washington Monument State Park and stumbled upon some breakfast trail magic. A very kind couple from Ohio had cooked up some eggs, sausage, bacon, and biscuits and gravy. We enjoyed a large helping of everything and washed it down with some orange juice. Once we left we walked about 1/4 of a mile to the Washington monument in the park, found a nice spot in the shade and decided to let the mid-day heat go by. After about a 2 hour nap we figured it was time to hike the remaining 5 miles of our 16 mile lazy day. At the end of our hike today (4pm) we were at Annapolis Rocks. This particular location has experienced a lot of damage due to over use in the last decade. In 2003 the State decided to take control by putting in a full time caretaker; fencing off the most abused area and only allowing camping in designated spots. It seems to have helped because it is a very nice place to camp, with a wonderful view of farmlands and small towns below. 5-29-16We didn't get up quite as early today but we still managed to leave camp around 7am. We had another short day of 17 miles which would get us just on the other side of the Mason Dixon and into Pennsylvania. We decided half way through the day to stop at a park just 1 mile short of or campsite for the night. At this particular park our guide book says there are vending machines and bathrooms and you can order pizza to be delivered! We thought we couldn't turn down. Upon arrival we found out there was a Memorial Day dance going on, the pavilion was full of people dancing to live music. It was amazing to me that this many people came out to dance, and I have to say that they were really good! After about an hour of watching the dance we ordered pizza, 4 of us made short work of two large pizzas, charged our phones and hit the trail. A short walk to the Mason Dixon line and then a little further to the campsite where we set up tents and pretty much went straight to bed. Looks like some rain is coming in tonight. I'm ok with that, maybe it won't be so hot! 5-30-16Happy Memorial Day! This morning we started off just about 6 miles south of a picnic area called Old Forge Picnic Area. We have heard rumors of people having cookouts to feed hikers on the weekends during the summer, we thought with it being Memorial Day we would stand a good chance of getting some good food. Our luck wasn't that good. We did however find a nice sunny spot to spread out wet gear out and let it dry. After an hour or two I hiked on. Riptide noticed in our guide book that in a few short miles we would cross a road, and about 1.3 miles east on that road was a place called ""South Mountain Hotel"". They served food and also allowed hikers to pitch a tent outside. We thought it would be nice to have a meal and maybe catch part of the NBA Western Conference Finals game 7. Once we got to the establishment we learned that it was in fact not a hotel, but rather a small smoke filled local watering hole. We ordered some food anyway (surprisingly not bad). A few locals came over and asked if we were hiking and wanted to hear all about it. They were very nice people and before they left they gave us two cups of soup. One was vegetable crab and one was a Pennsylvania specialty ""chicken and corn soup"". I ended up with the vegetable crab and it was fantastic! I didn't have any of the chicken and corn but Riptide said it was pretty bland and he had to spice it up with a rice side. After we ate the crowd got a little thicker and a little rougher around the edges. Since it was only 6pm we decided to head back out rather than camp. A few short minutes later and a ride in the back of a 90s model Ford, fully equipped with what I can only assume and illegal siren system, we were back on the trail just two miles short of the shelter we were staying at. 5-31-16We woke up this morning feeling refreshed and ready to head to Caledonia State Park which was about 4 miles away. The park was the location of a snack bar and a beautiful, very large swimming pool! We were a little early and had to wait for about 2 hours before they opened at 11am. Once 11 rolled around no one was there to let us in and feed us. I gave the park a call to inquire about the lack of employees there and they informed me that the pool only opens on the weekends until June 11. By this time there were 9 thru-hikers there and interested in a swim and a snack. Much to our disappointment, we had to go on without either. Except for Mass and Rambo, they hitched to town and got a room at the Days Inn and swam in the pool there. I suppose I'll see them down the trail. We hiked a few more miles to a shelter that was just great, beautiful porch with a picnic table, tent pads, great spring just a few feet in front of the shelter and several lawn decorations that made it a very comfortable place. We found a deck of cards and played cards for an hour or more before leaving to sleep at the next shelter 7 miles away. Tomorrow morning we will hike 3 miles and arrive at the official 2016 AT midpoint! That will be a great moment and I'm excited to walk past it and continue north to Maine. 6-1-16 This morning we made it to the halfway point and beyond! As some of you may know there is a tradition that thru-hikers participate in around the halfway point of the trail, and that is the ""half-gallon challenge"". The challenge is to eat a half gallon of ice cream and it takes place at the general store in Pine Grove Furnace State Park. I was a little intimidated when I got there but I figured I'd go ahead and give it a try anyway. I bought the first 1.5 quart of Neapolitan and finished it in about 35 minutes. The final leg was a pint of cotton candy flavored ice cream, this is when I hit the wall. After a few deep breaths I was able to force down the last bit of ice cream and finish the half gallon challenge! It was a lot of fun and I'm very happy I tried it. After the challenge me and about 5 other hikers walked a half mile to the lake and went swimming. It was a beautiful day and we spent most of it relaxing. Later in the afternoon we hiked on about 7 miles to the next shelter and camped out for the night. The sugar rush from the ice cream kept me up a little longer than normal but that was ok with me. The next few days flew by for me. We were walking through little towns and corn fields and I was anxious about Amy visiting me in Duncannon. I hadn't seen her since North Carolina at the NOC, so I was excited to say the least. We've spent a few days hiking and visiting the Hersey chocolate factory, it was a great weekend! Tomorrow I hit the trail again and will have my eye on Maine, I can almost feel the end coming and I am focused on finishing. Thanks again for the support!","Harpers Ferry

Tortilla,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540838,"Pennsylvania was a blur, a rocky blur. Everyone calls it ""rocksylvania"" and it lived up to the name! I was anticipating a lot of rocks and I was still shocked at the amount. But it was still fun and we cruised right through. New Jersey was a short 3 night and 4 day hike with a lot of animals and several great views. New York has been tough so far but equally as beautiful as New Jersey. This morning I was able to see the New York skyline for the first time on trail and I am going to be crossing the Hudson River in just a few hours. Pretty soon New York will be complete and we will be in New England! ...a few days later....Well I got a little distracted and completely forgot about writing in my journal. When I last wrote I was in New York, well now I am in the northern part of Massachusetts. Connecticut was a great state but rather short and Massachusetts has been wonderful so far. I am currently laying in my tent listening to fireworks in the distance, after all, tomorrow is the Fourth of July! I will post another entry soon giving some details of my time in New England and what is upcoming. Thanks!","Duncannon, Pennsylvania

Tortilla,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541723,"New England. Well, so far it has been fantastic! That goes for the entire trail but for now I am specifically talking about Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont. Connecticut started out with some great trail magic from a fellow hikers mother - thanks Croc-n-rolls mom! At only 50 miles, CT is a very short state, although it is very challenging at times. The most memorable part of the state to me was the town of Kent. It was almost like a modern day Mayberry. The local outfitter which doubled as an ice cream shop lets hikers lounge around on the lawn eating ice cream and charging electronic devices inside. If you get tired of ice cream and wanted real food you simply walked down main street to the diner, after that you walk a little further to the market to buy food for the trail, when you were ready to leave you stuck out your thumb and very soon a car stopped to pick you up, simple as that. It almost seemed to good to be true. That town was hard to leave. Massachusetts was one of the more enjoyable parts of the trail, ponds (should be called lakes) were scattered all over the place, it made for a great place to take a ""shower"". Massachusetts is also where I found myself on my favorite holiday -- Independence Day. We woke up at Kay Wood shelter on the 4th. Just 2.5 miles from a little town called Dalton, our plan was to walk through town and stop for breakfast at the Dalton restaurant and then get back on the trail. Shortly after arriving we came upon a few hikers we knew just hanging out under a shade tree and drinking coffee in some mans yard. My first thought was this is trail magic and if I ate enough here then I would not have to spend so much money at the restaurant. We soon met the man who owned the yard, Tom Lavarti, Tom has been a trail angel for over 20 years, he has allowed thru hikers to tent on his lawn and gives free rides to town and offers to slack pack you if you'd like. After a few minutes of talking with Tom you could really tell he just enjoyed chatting with hikers and hearing stories from the trail, I had a feeling we may not make it much further on this day. Tom invited us to stay and said later in the afternoon he would drive us to the next town over, Pittsfield, they were having a baseball game and a firework show afterwards, I knew we were staying then. So after 2.5 miles we decided we would give ourselves a Independence Day treat, a nero (Nearly zero miles hiked day)! And we weren't the only hikers that felt this way, at least 15 hikers stayed the night. After Massachusetts we entered Vermont, that is when the end really started feeling near. The first few days were wonderful, great weather and beautiful scenery. I thought Massachusetts had a lot of ponds but it has nothing on Vermont. I keep scanning the shore line looking for a moose but I haven't spotted one yet. The last two days have been very wet and muddy. Today was the worst of the two and for about a mile we walked in what was just like a creek, water above your ankle and rushing down hill. Not the best hiking conditions. But i am huddled up in a shelter warm and dry now so that is nice! Vermont will end soon and we will be in New Hampshire looking up at the White Mountains. Everyone always talks about how challenging but beautiful the Whites are. Some days I am a bit nervous but most days I am very excited to hike such a challenging section. It should be a lot of fun that is for sure. I'll check back in again soon with another update. Thanks again for your support. See ya soon!","Massachusetts

Tortilla,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544046,"New Hampshire and the White Mountains were every bit as challenging and beautiful as I hoped it would be. Hawk and I left Hanover, New Hampshire and hiked over what we thought were some big mountains, and compared to recent climbs they were. Our first night we stayed at a house that was once owned by a man named Bill Ackerly. Bill has been a legend on the AT for several years now, he is most popular for giving ice cream to hikers and allowing them to camp on his property. Unfortunately Bill passed away earlier this year so I was unable to meet him, but his family is still keeping the fridge stocked with ice cream and allowing hikers to camp on the property. Two days after our stay at the ice cream mans house we were finally at the bottom of Mt. Moosilauke, the first big climb of the White Mountains. This climb goes up about 3,750 feet over 5.5 miles, needless to say I was ready to get up and over this thing! It took us right at 2 hours to reach the cold, windy and cloud covered summit, and it was not as difficult as I anticipated it being. We climbed down the north side of the mountain and decided not to stop at a shelter - we decided we would hitch a ride into Lincoln New Hampshire and stay at a trail angels house. The owner of the house is named Chet. Chet has opened his house to through hikers for over 20 years now. Some places we have stayed on this trip have been great, and Chets' was no different, you can really tell that he lets hikers stay because he truly enjoys their company and stories. And since the hostel is donation only it's obvious that he doesn't do it for the money. We actually stayed there two nights because we decided we would slack pack a 17 mile section between Kinsman Notch and Franconia Notch. After arriving at Franconia Notch we hitched a ride back to Chets' place. We left Chets' place the next morning and headed back to Franconia Notch for another tough climb up to the Franconia Ridge. This is where we would get our first several mile section above tree line, and it was truly amazing. We took our time getting up and over, especially since the weather was perfect. Unfortunately for us the forecast was going to not be perfect in the next day or so, and it was going to be the exact time we would be hiking in the Presidential Range, which is mostly above tree line. We decided to take a short day and go into town to wait out the storm. At this time Hawk and I had met back up with Leprechaun and Zoë and had met two other hikers named Vice and Fortune Cookie. The six of us found a motel that had a chalet next to it that could hold us all and we waited out the storm there. The next day we walked into the Presidential Range and to the Mizpah Hut. We got caught in a small storm just before arriving - I guess we didn't hang out in town long enough. Hawk and I were lucky and we were allowed to do a work for stay at the hut. Which means they let us sleep upstairs in a library and they fed us leftovers, in return we washed dishes for about 30 minutes, pretty sweet deal. The next morning the bad weather was gone, the forecast was great and reports from Mt Washington were that visibility was 110 miles that morning - it was going to be the perfect day in the White Mountains. Shortly after leaving the hut we were above tree line and would not be back down until about 6:30 that night. The skies were clear, temperatures were around 75 and the wind was 5-10 mph, you can not ask for a better day to hike over Mt Washington, which by the way has the worst weather in America and the highest wind speed ever recorded, but that wasn't the case on this day. For the most part the White Mountains were pretty much over after this section, we still had about 25 miles left but the big mountains and super long climbs were over. The views were so spectacular that you hardly even notice how difficult the terrain is. The next day we went over the Wildcat Mountains, which were also very challenging I might add. After the Wildcats' we had a nice 15 mile day into Gorham, New Hampshire. We had to come into town to resupply and rest a little bit from the beating the White Mountains had put on us. The most exciting part was that from Gorham we were only 16 miles from the final state on this journey - Maine! And that is where I am today. I will spend the night tonight 1.5 miles from the Mahoosuc Notch which is known as the most difficult or the most fun mile of the trail. It is 1 mile of a jumbled pit of boulders that you have to climb over, under and around, it all sounds fun to me so I am excited! We made it through the notch and it was a lot of fun! Crawling through holes, leaping from boulder to boulder, it was like a playground. Also, it was really cold there. Ice and snow is still in a lot of the holes, it was nice to get out of the heat for a little while. By the way, it took me 1 hour to get through. Thanks for reading, see ya soon!","Vermont
