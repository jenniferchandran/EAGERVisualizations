Wy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519173,"Hi, Everyone!Well, after a two-year break, it's time to begin journaling again. My brother, WYNOTT and I (WY) hit the AT two years ago, and had a marvelous time hiking north from Springer Mountain. We got to Fontana Dam before I had to leave the trail, as planned, and return to work here in Seattle.My brother continued another 125 miles north until food poisoning, severe blisters, and general discouragement knocked him off the trail (he made it as far as Hot Springs, NC). After two years of thinking about it, WYNOTT is ready to hit the trail again! He plans to start where he left off--Hot Springs--and continue north for another section. If he finishes, I've promised to fly out to Mt. Katahdin and do the last few miles with him.WYNOTT is planning an early April start date from Hot Springs. I won't be joining him for this adventure, but I'm looking forward to following many of you fellow hikers as you journey north this year. Happy Trails to all--and I'll post again later when there are further developments!",,View Entry,"Jan 06, Wed",0
Wy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519180,"Friends:When I was section hiking with my brother in 2014, I saw enough ""rookie errors"" (and did some of them myself) to fill a book. Well, not quite, but enough to fill a couple postings here!So it might be helpful if I do a few postings on the most common errors I saw on the trail that might very well spell failure.#1 -- too much pack weight. This is the #1 reason for failure, in my opinion. You'll be surprised at how many people are lugging way too much stuff as they stagger down the trail. There is no way they are going to last 2,200 miles with that boulder on their back. In fact, you'll usually only see this type of thing for the first week or so--those people just don't last long.I recommend a base pack weight of 25-28 lbs. maximum. That means the weight of your pack and ALL your gear--every last bit of it--except for food and water, and we won't count the clothes on your back.If your pack weighs 25 lbs. or less, you're good to go. If it's 28 lbs., you're borderline. If it's 30 lbs., start figuring out which items to leave home. And if you're in the 35-40 lbs. range, you are NOT ready to hike--unless you are in extraordinary physical shape (and most of us aren't--don't kid yourself)...to be continued...",,View Entry,"Jan 07, Thu",0
Wy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519216,"Here's the second reason why many people fail the AT--they go too far or too fast, too soon. I made this mistake when my brother and I section-hiked from Springer Mountain in 2014.The first day was easy. ""This is a piece of cake,"" I thought, and almost danced down the trail with delight.The second day started off fine--but by that evening, I was so exhausted that I could hardly find the energy to pitch my tent, cook supper and drop into bed.What happened? On the second day, we really pushed the mileage and the speed of our walking, because we wanted to get to a certain gap by 6pm and catch a shuttle to a nearby motel. We didn't realize how far we still had to go, and so we really forced ourselves to keep walking fast, even when I knew that I was not in shape to walk that fast or that far.The gap ended up being a lot farther down the trail than we thought, and we missed the shuttle by at least half an hour. However, I finally called a halt, and insisted that we stop and camp, even though we hadn't even reached our intended stopping point for the night. The next day, I was so wiped that I took a ""zero day"" [no hiking] while my brother tackled Blood Mountain, a pretty major climb. I phoned around until I located a local driver who would shuttle me to Neel Gap, and I hung out at Mountain Crossings, a famous store on the AT (the trail actually goes right through the building!), which is about 30 miles up the trail from the southern terminus (Springer Mountain).After a restful day and a good night's sleep, I was ready to go again. But I learned a lesson that day--listen to your body. If you push it too hard, you could find yourself getting injured, and you'll be forced to quit your AT adventure--or at least be delayed in reaching your goal of a thru-hike....to be continued...","

Wy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519478,"Here's my third reason on why people fail: they use new/untested equipment. This applies especially to footwear, but it can also apply to other items.When my brother and I did a section hike in 2014, we had some interesting challenges almost from the first day.Before the hike, I debated which boots to wear. I had a pair that were about a year old, but I hadn't worn them very much. So they were not well broken-in. But they had excellent tread, in case of snow, mud or slippery wet rocks.I also had an old pair that were very worn. But they had little tread and so I wondered if I would have difficulty on slippery sections.After some internal debate, I decided to take the old pair. Fortunately, I had minimal problems with slipping, even when we hit some snow during the first week. There were other wet sections of the trail that were pretty steep downhill, but I did fine. So I think that I made the right decision in regards to footwear.My brother had some boots which he hadn't worn very much. Almost from the first day, he had blister problems that caused a lot of discomfort and pain. Finally, after a few days, he managed to get a shuttle to an outfitters which sold boots, and he bought another pair which were a better fit and seemed to work better. But those new boots also caused painful blisters and ultimately were part of the reason that my brother decided to quit the trail.Tents, backpacks and other major items need to be tested thoroughly before you begin your hike. Have you actually set up your tent? By yourself? In the dark when it's pouring rain? If you test your equipment under conditions similar to what you'll encounter on the trail, you'll have less surprises and a greater chance of success. For example, if you do any reading on this site, you'll know that it's almost guaranteed that you'll be hiking in rain--sometimes for days on end. And shelters may be full, so you'll likely be forced to set up your tent out in the rain somewhere. Ultimately, this kind of thing won't necessarily bump you off the trail, but it could make your hike much less pleasant than if your equipment was tested more thoroughly before you began.... to be continued...","

Wy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519578,"If you want to fail the AT, don't do any physical prep to get ready for your hike. After all, everyone loses weight on the trail, right? It's common to lose about one pound/day for the first few weeks. Sounds like a great diet plan to me. So just plan to get in shape after you start hiking--it's easy!Well...... when my brother and I hiked in 2014, I thought I was doing really well in terms of physical training. I live in Seattle, and we have a wonderful lake near my workplace that has a footpath around the lake--about 3 miles. So I threw my backpack in the back of my car and would stop at Green Lake several times a week and hike around the lake before going home.Sounds good... except that the footpath was paved and level, and my backpack was only partially loaded (about 20 lbs). When I got onto the AT in Georgia, it was constant PUD's [pointless ups and downs] and my backpack weighed about 28 lbs. plus food and water. So my training conditions weren't that close to what I actually faced on the AT. Looking back, it would have been much smarter for me to go on training hikes with a fully-loaded pack in hilly terrain. So, here's my word to the wise: Take your training seriously. Being out of shape won't necessarily knock you off the trail, but you'll definitely have more fun during your first weeks on the AT if you are in shape. You'll actually enjoy the walking, rather than just enduring it.","

Wy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520139,"As promised, here are the answers to the A.T. Quiz (see previous post).1. (c) Earl Shaffer, a World War II vet, who ""hiked off"" his war experiences by thru-hiking the A.T.2. (c) 14 states3. (d) 16 times (total elevation gain/loss=464,464')4. (b) 1940s (1948)5. (b) 2,190 miles. The exact length changes annually, due to trail reconstruction after floods, storms, land purchases, etc.6. (c) In hiking circles, you have the ""fever"" when you can't stop thinking, dreaming, saving towards, and otherwise showing a mental fixation on all things related to hiking the A.T.7. (d) approx. 5 million (I haven't counted--I'll take others' word for it)8. (a) This is heresy to AT purists, who insist on walking past each and every white blaze, rather than skipping portions due to bad trail conditions, terrible weather, illness, etc.9. (b) Although I've read a few accounts by thru-hikers who never saw any mice, others report that most of the shelters attract field mice who rummage through hikers' possessions at night. When I section-hiked in 2014, mice even chewed up a pair of hiking socks I left out to dry overnight--apparently the salt from my sweaty feet tasted good to them.10. (c) Clingman's Dome (6,644')","
