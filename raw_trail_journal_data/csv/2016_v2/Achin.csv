Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524158,"Hello again. This is my third year of hiking the AT. Started out as an aspiring thru-hiker in March, 2014. Made it to Bland, VA a total of 582 miles. The next year (now as a section hiker) I continued on from Bland to just past Glasgow (i.e. James River area) another 200 miles.Now in 2016, I plan on getting on the AT at my previous point of departure on 4/1 and continuing North. This year my goal is to reach the NJ/NY border. This is within 15 miles of my boyhood home in NJ. This will add about 600 miles to my AT total.",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Sun",0
Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524698,"So, for my third year of hiking the AT I have been trying to get into trail ready shape again. In the 4th quarter of 2015 (Oct-Dec), I walked over 300 miles in nearby Hitchcock Woods. All of this was done without a backpack. Wanted to get my legs and feet used to being active again. In February I added my backpack to the mix with anywhere from starting with 23 pounds up to a recent 40 pound level. Typical distances started out averaged about 10 miles with 13 being the longest. Have done over 100 miles with the backpack.I'm expecting my real backpack weight to be about 35 pounds fully loaded. That is down slightly from my previous 2 years of 39 and 37.After struggling with the uphills in prior years, I've added stair climbing machines at the gym this year as well. Feel like that is helping with uphill endurance.Most of my training is in beautiful Hitchcock Woods here in Aiken, SC. It is among the largest urban forests in the United States with over 2,100 acres and 70 miles of trails.   I'd like to give a shout out to my friends there: Bennett (Woods Superintendent), Eric (Woods Resource Stewart) and just recently met Christine (Executive Director). I (as well as all of Aiken) am so lucky to have such a real asset in our community. And for me it is within walking distance.With only a week to go until my departure, I feel I am in reasonable shape...although not as well as I had hoped. Still, based upon experience I think it will be good enough starting out with a reasonable pace over the first few weeks.Time will tell.",,View Entry,"Mar 21, Mon",0
Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525099,"Getting very close to targeted start date of 4/1. My to do list is getting smaller... and more manageable too. Only 3 more days at home to get them done, a travel day on Thursday and start hiking on Friday.There is a nagging issue that could delay my departure. Several days ago on a practice hike I suffered a hematoma on the bottom of my foot. Came home to find a pool of blood under the skin a little ways to the side of the ball of my left foot (cause a broken blood vessel). Since then I've done the ice, elevation and rest process. It still doesn't look the best; but, I believe it is healing. the real question is will it reoccur upon hiking again. Obviously, I do not want to wait and get that answer on the trail after driving to central VA to find out. So either tomorrow or Tuesday I'll be going on another local practice hike to test it out. If it bleeds again, I'll know I have to take more time to heal and will delay my departure. If not, it is a go for this week.In thinking about the cause, it could be a breakdown of my hiking shoes. Thinking back I believe I have probably put 400 miles plus on them. So, planning on getting a replacement pair tomorrow. Keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for the best.",,View Entry,"Mar 27, Sun",0
Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525349,"Earlier today I did my last practice hike in nearby Hitchcock Woods. Went about 8 miles with what should be my AT weight backpack of 37 pounds. The picture is from the interior of the Woods where they are in preperation for the annual Horse Show this week-end. Aiken is a very equestrian oriented town and the woods are used by them all the time (have to watch where you step all the time). This annual horse show is a big deal and has been going on for many years. A recent acquaintance, Trish, invited me to attend. I told her maybe next year as I will be in VA hiking as it begins.My hike went very well. That is good news since it was my first hike in a week after sustaining a foot injury as I mentioned in the last post. Was very happy to not have any further issues with it. So, now everything is on track for my planned 4/1 start date. Beside rest, ice and elevation of the foot, I bought a new pair of hiking shoes after I realized that I had at least 400, maybe closer to 500 miles on the old ones. After my 8 mile hike today I did a fair amount of yard work so Wendy won't have to worry about it for a little while. Here in Aiken, spring is in full bloom and quite beautiful now. Azaleas are plentiful all over the area. We're only about 25 miles form Augusta, GA. So. if you watch the Masters Golf tournament next week you'll get a feel for how pretty it can be.My to do list is manageable for my one day left at home. So. I am eager to get going. And looking forward to watching out for roots and rocks instead of Horse dudu.",,View Entry,"Mar 28, Mon",0
Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525741,"Wendy and I are safely in our motel in Lexington, VA. It was about a six and a half hour drive today. Picture is out of the motel room looking at the mountain range I'll be going up.Ready and eager to head out early tomorrow morning. The weather forecast is 50% thunderstorms tonight and 80% tomorrow. The good news is all the rain should be over around noon. And it will be a warm day, probably in the 70's.Feel bad Wendy will be having to drive home on the rain. But, nothing we can do about that now.

Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526368,"3 year total AT mileage = 794.8My first day of this years hike was a long and difficult one. Hiked from 8am until 4:45pm. Was sure mucho tired. But I am settled in my tent, bear bag hung(after about 20 throws) and feeling well otherwise.For those of you familiar with my hiking experiences, you know today was my 3rd time hiking up the 2,300 mountain from the James River. This time I won and continued on instead of turning around, hiking back down and going home. Oh what a relief it is!Met a real nice couple and their dog who are staying in the shelter here. They are Heinz and Salt from Florida( formerly from Maine). Had a nice couple of hours talking about hiking experiences. They also started a section hike today going south to Damascus, VA.Already had my first fall. Scratches on side of knee, wrist and surprisingly a small puncture hole on the nail of one finger. Could have been much worse- it was a face plant with my forehead ending up several inches from a protruding rock. I'll try to not let that happen again.Now got to take an allieve, pamper my feet and get to sleep.","

Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526369,"3 year AT mileage total = 804.3Although about a mile shorter and much less uphill efforts, today was still enough to totally tucker me out. Hiked from 9am to 4pm. Did pass a mileage milestone this afternoon of 800 AT miles. Wow!!!A front came through over night. Thankfully lower temps(was about 70 degrees yesterday) and a few light showers overnight. So, had to carry a damp tent today.Met 2 thru-hikers today that started in GA earlier this year. They are really moving doing 30 mile days sometimes. Also saw several day hikers and short section hikers. One I'll need to follow is ""YOLO"" who has a trail journal also, real nice guy from Charlotte.Sleeping in the shelter tonight to hopefully help in getting an early start tomorrow. Have a reservation at a hostel that is 8.1 miles away with a big elevation to climb...,oh boy!At lower elevations flowering trees (redbud, dogwood) are blooming. At the higher elevations, nothing yet.
Passes a memorial today dedicated to a young boy who wandered off from school and was later found deceased.","punchbowl shelter

Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526370,"3 year AT total mileage = 812.4Day started out quite chilly, probably approaching freezing. On top of that were very strong winds making the wind chill problematic. I kept adding clothes during the morning until the wind died down and the warmth finally arrived around noon.Hiked from 7:50 til 4:15. A 2,700 foot incline really slowed me down. Hate those big uphills.Met lots of nice people today - all day hikers or short section hikers. Really enjoyed talking with Lewis's. I probably spent 30 minutes or more in on trail discussions today. Staying at the 3 Springs Hostel. Had a pizza,showered and washed my clothes. A very comfortable place, only one other hiker here, a section hiker. Would have liked to take a zero day here tomorrow; but, they are closed on Mondays. So, I'll hike on and shoot for lower miles for awhile.","Brown Mountain Creek Sheltet

Today's shelter and tomorrow's are 7.7 and 6.6 miles. So doing 2 short day's instead- hoping that will give my body some needed rest. And these 2 days have minimal inclines to make it even better.Now that the week-end is over so are the hikers out here. Saw one couple early today and no one since. Currently alone at the shelter and staying in it with a chance of thunderstorms later tonight.Day was pleasant with a little breeze that was nice after the morning chill was over. I arrived at the shelter at 1:30pm. So have lots of time to rest.To my friends at BAE, count your blessings and be thankful you're not out here. Where you'd really have to work.Late updates: 1. while waiting for my dinner to cook, I was walking around the area and saw 4 dead mice laying in the ashes of the fire ring. They looked fresh and I'm assuming last nights guests had some battles with the little creatures.2. Just at dark another hiker (Roadrunner) showed up late so I had a companion. He is a thru-hiker from NC who is taking a few semesters off from Northwestern Univ. for this hike.","3 Springs Hostel

Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526690,"3 year AT mileage = 826.7Another short mileage day at 6.6 miles with cool, sometimes windy weather. Good for hiking and without any significant uphill climbs. Still I struggled with those darn smaller uphills. Not enjoying the struggle. And experiencing foot issues besides.Stayed inside the shelter last night due to thunderstorm threat that never happened. It did get quite cold by morning. Therefore had partially frozen water bottles and had some light snow flurries.I still do enjoy the vista's from being up on the ridge lines and the meeting and greeting other hikers. At the shelter to night are 4 of us socializing and one guy who walked right by us, set up his tent and did not come back over to the shelter.","Seeley-Woodworth Shelter

Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526691,"3 year FINAL AT miles 826.1 miles.Was a cold night, glad I tented which is a little warmer than the drafty shelter. One of the guys in the shelter had a thermometer and recorded 22 degrees. Therefore again frozen water bottles and stiff shoes.Sadly, this is the last day of this hike. I strongly suspected such last night and made a final decision this morning. Basically the uphill struggles (coupled with foot concerns) over weighed the desire to go on. In retrospect, I knew I was not in as good of physical as I should have been for the considerable efforts required of an AT hike. But the desire over took my rational side.So, the easiest way to get off the trail was to backtrack about a mile to a very seldom used rough dirt road. And then take a 3 mile side trail down to a commercial camp grounds. Then try to make some travel arrangements from there. I must be living well because I ran into a trail maintainer (Bob) walking towards me carrying a large chain saw. No, it's not what you're thinking- he didn't use it to put me out of my misery. He was just going about a mile up the trail to clear any fallen trees and repaint some white blazes. He offered me a ride if I wanted to wait a few hours until he returned to his truck. It was a long, cold wait for him; but, beneficial in that I got a ride to a Waynesboro, VA Comfort Inn. From here I have a rental car reserved for tomorrow morning to drive home.I am quite sure that my continuing northbound AT efforts are over FOREVER. I know I've said that before; but, am very sure this time. I may do another short section that I've looking forward to, the Shenandoah National Park. It is suppose to be teeming with wildlife, a moderate trail and has several ""waysides"" with breakfast, lunch and dinner possibilities. Maybe this fall or next spring. Time will tell.So now I sign out. I appreciate all my friends and followers who supported my 3 year AT efforts. As I said before it was the hardest job I ever enjoyed. I really did and will forever have fine memories of the AT and the many fellow hikers I have been so blessed with meeting.Now that I know I will me home on May 29th, the focus will be on Wendy and I deciding where to go and enjoy our 45th anniversary. What a loyal friend and supporter she had been.Note: pic is of my Aiken based grandkids (less the one on stripped pants) enjoying Disney World while I work hard on the AT.Achin out!!!!!    ??????","The Priest Sheltet

Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549535,"From my previous entry, one would surmise that I would never hit the AT again. Well, I have changed my mind. This is not a rash decision. Two factors lead me to believe that I can be successful again. 1/ I've lost 24 pounds since last Spring. 2/ A few months ago it was determined that I was anemic. Upon further investigations of prior blood tests, I have been border line anemic for several years. After starting Iron pills I can easily tell the difference in strength and endurance. So as a result, I feel I am much better capable of the rigorous daily grind of a long distance hike and I am ready to go.So starting Tuesday, Sept 27 I'll get back on the AT where I got off in VA. That point is about 35 miles south of the Shenandoah National Park. Timing is great to avoid the summer heat and catch the peak of Fall foliage in that beautiful park. My goal is to hike to my boyhood home in Northern NJ. Should take about 2 months to cover the approximate 500+ miles.Plan on posting daily journals as I have in the past...subject to phone coverage and phone battery life.P.S. May not be as strong as Superman. Can't leap tall buildings in a single bound or be as fast as a speeding bullet or be a powerful as a locomotive. BUT, I am feeling good and hoping those mountains will provide amazing scenery and not the frustrating uphill climbs of a weaker, more over-weight Achin of the past.",,Surprise - Going Out Again,"Sep 25, Sun",0

Arrived in Waynesboro at noon. Turned in rental car, had lunch and got shuttle ride to arrive at my hike starting point at 2pm.   Arrived at shelter at 5:30. Have since set up tent, had dinner, hung near bag and socialized with 2 other hikers here. A young man from Atlanta doing a south bound thru hike and a woman about my age, Trail name Quill, also section hiking northward who is from Durham NC.It was a long day; but, I feel okay. We're some good uphills today and I did fairly well. Hoping not getting much sleep last night and the long drive up here were detrimental factors to not running up those hills. Real test will be Thursday with a long uphill hike. Tomorrow is lots of downhill followed by a shorter uphill.","Home

Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549954,"3 year AT mileage = 834.3Did 7.6 miles today and it was mostly downhill. An elevation drop of 3,000 feet. My ""breaking"" downhill muscles were exhausted by the unusually constant downhill. Most of the day was walking through fog which made rocks slippery....and there was a multitude of rocks. Makes for slow walking making sure of safe footsteps. Due to the foggy conditions many promising vistas were disappointing.

They are about 2/3 done on there Maine to Georgia adventure.Was surprised to arrive at the shelter and Quill was already there. From last nights shelter she could not find the white blaze markers for the AT. There happened to be another trail between the 2 shelters so she took it...turns out it was shorter.Young girl arrived at the shelter tonight. Another north bounder, only the 2nd I've run into.

Was overly ambitious today. 15.2 miles to the next shelter, after averaging only about 7 the last 3 days. The elevations did not look bad, so went for it.
Trail was rocky again and rainy most of the day. So very slow going. Quill caught up to me and we were hiking together. About 5 miles short of the shelter and already at 6 pm, we decided to stealth camp. Found a good spot big enough for 2 tents. Set up in pouring rain. Lots of fun.

After 2 nights of heavy rains several small streams usually just rock hopped across we turrets. Was a little scary for me to cross on rocks that were partially covered and having a foot or more of fast moving stream beside them. Obviously made it OK and my hiking shoes were totally wet anyway.Pack was very heavy today with much wet clothing, tent, food bag and the bag itself.Staying at a hostel run by Stanimal, a 2004 thru hiker. Nice bunkhouse set up in his basement with everything a hiker needs. It's in a nice neighborhood and a short walk to a real good bar & sandwich shop that was sooo good.

Been looking forward to that for years. Timing is right to see beautiful fall foliage. Was part of my plan. The AT goes through the SNP for 101 miles. So will probably be in there for about 10 days. And it has what they call ""waysides"" that serve B/L/D about 30 miles apart. Good food more often....wonderful. Noticed today the potential for a hurricane moving up the east coast.

Did 8.7 miles stopping about 3pm (that does not include about .6 miles off trail to a shelter for lunch). Could have easily gone further; but, the last known water source is here until tomorrow's targeted shelter. So, want to start out with 2 full liters in the morning.Stealth camping alone tonight, Quill got ahead of me today. Probably will catch up with her at the next shelter tomorrow night. Picked a spot about 100 yards up a gravel road and just above a locked steel forrest road gate. Should not be seen by anyone tonight.Besides a deer this morning, saw two new animals on my AT travels - a good sized mole digging around on the trail and a wooly caterpillar.Still very few colorful tree leaves. Expecting that to change soon.Today's pic is unusual. On top of Bears Den mountain there are numerous communication towers. There is also an area where someone installed several old tractor seats in cement. Sure was nice to have a comfortable seat for awhile.Saw about 6 south bounders today and a group of 5 oriental persons going north.All is well. Good night from SNP.PS: after dinner I walked up the old dirt road I'm camping just off of, to hang my bear bad over a tree branch over the road. While doing so, a pick up truck came slowly backing down the road. A nice man said he thought he saw a bear and had to come check it out. When he first saw me I was bent over attaching my food bag and wearing my nightly attire - black top and bottom long johns. Thought he was going to see a bear until I stood up and he saw a white beard.PSS: after dinner and bear bag hung, I was laying down in my tent and heard a car coming down the gravel road. Looked out of tent a saw a teenager out of a car and holding the rope of my bear bag. I yelled to him. Two teenagers (kind of sleazy looking) drove on down to my tent in a beat up old car. Said they were lost, helped them turn around in the partially obstructed turn around area without running over my tent and they were off up the hill. Was concerned about them coming back later, so took down my bear bag and moved it down below the gate.PSSS: About 8:30pm I was sound asleep when I was awakened by the sound of a vehicle coming down the gravel road. It stopped right by my tent. A large white pick up truck. Man got out and asked what I was doing here,etc. Turns out he is an AT trail maintainer coming to pick up some empty gallon water jugs he had left for water for hikers several days earlier when it was quite dry around here. Turns out his son is currently doing a double yoyo AT hike (i.e. From here to Maine, down to Georgia and then back here). With his large truck and my tent taking up some of the turnaround area, he could not turn. Nice guy that he was, he just backed up the road for a least 100 yards or more.

But due to a bone headed mistake and a planned side trail to get good food, it was more like 15.5 or so. The planned side trail was to a SNP Wayside (i.e. Restaurant). The bone head mistake was going past both side trails going into it and not realizing it for quite awhile. Unfortunately the back tracking and side trail were uphills that I love so much. Decision to back track was mostly to get phone recharged - but food sounded good too.Anyway had a cheeseburger, hot dog and bowl of tomato soup there. And got some charge into my phone that was down to 13%. Later that night while only typing this journal, went down to 25%.

While having food together at Elkwallow Wayside, a man came up and gave us each an apple - yes, trail magic.I'm stealth camping alone tonight.After seeing hundreds of people yesterday, only saw about 10 today.13.6 is my biggest day this Fall. And I can feel it - it is a 2 alleeve night tonight.Only one more full day and then a partial in SNP.Today's pic is informational. Most shelters/huts in SNP have bear poles for hanging your food bag. Today's was the first I've seen with a bear box. Heavy steel box with a latch that bear paws cannot reach into to open.","Byrds Nest #3 Shelter

Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550416,"3 year AT mileage = 966.2Another biggest mileage day for this fall at 14.4 miles. For the most it was nice trails, easy to turn on the after-burners except for the frequent spectacular viewing points. Today's 14.4 miles seemed much easier than some much shorter days. MAYBE, I'm getting younger???Was wrong in my last post when I thought the SNP ended at Front Royal. It ends several miles short of there so I finished it this afternoon. Sorry to see it end, I loved it.One drawback today was the shelter had an horrible water source. Dramatically downhill and very weak having to wait for drops to accumulate into something worthwhile. I heard about it and knowing I had a short day tomorrow, decided to make due.On the positive side there was an interesting group of 7 people representing Spain, Australia, Maryland, New Hampshire and SC. Sat at the picnic table and discussed many subjects well after dark.Tomorrow a Nero day. Going into a hostel in Front Royal. Have a package waiting from Wendy.Today's pic is a selfie with long vista behind.","Stealth camp

After shower, updating a few days journals and planning my week ahead, got a ride to town with 3 other hikers. First stop was the laundromat and then burger & hard cider while waiting. Followed by food resupply and dinner.On the hike this morning passed a mile or more section with a high chain link fence out in the woods. Then a clearing area with multiple buildings in the distance. My first thought was Camp David. After reaching the hostel the host (Scott) advised it was The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, VA. He called it a close cousin of Jurassic Park. Google it and make your own conclusion. Today's pic is part of that complex.Achin out for today and on up the trail in the morning.","Tom Floyd Wayside Shelter

Started out in the lower 40's and probably got up to mid 70's. Left the hostel at 7:20 and felt pumped after yesterday's Nero. There were really no vista's at all today. Although I did stop in to see the nicest AT shelter so far, the Jim & Molly Dodd shelter. Besides the clean/modern shelter it has a separate covered picnic table, horse shoe pit and solar shower.Also, do not see many benches for weary hikers on the trail. Today there were 2 of them.Staying tonight in an unusual geodesic dome shelter that was constructed in 1987 when such domes were the big thing. Problem is that it is pretty small. 3 other people showed up after dinner and opted to stay in a new traditional shelter partially completed nearby. One of them is Dan Before who is quite a character with a storied hiking background. I actually met him last night at McDonalds while waiting for my ride to the hostel. His website is: www.bedore.org.In short, was a day where I felt good and the miles just sailed by.","Mountain Home Cabbin-Front Royal

Did 11.7 miles not including an .8 mile side trip. The extra miles was a .4 mile side trail called Ambassador Whitehouse Trail to a nice vista. It is either today's video or pic, whichever I can get to upload. It was recommended by a local hiker yesterday.Entered the storied AT Roller Coaster this afternoon. It is what my AT Guide calls ""13.5 miles of tightly packed ascents and descents."" At this campsite I have only 2.9 miles completed. So, more fun in store tomorrow.Continue to meet south bound thru hikers. But it seems to be tapering off, about 6 today. Also met a small group of Boy Scouts/leaders out for a day hike. Also a couple of Washington DC people on the side trail mentioned above.Still very little colored fall foliage. But on the positive side very few bugs as well.Achin out from northern Virginia.","Dicks Dome Shelter

The Roller Coaster is tough. Neither the uphills; nor, the downhills are that bad. What makes it real slow going is the almost constant rocky conditions. Have another 3.9 miles of it tomorrow morning.On the positive side, I (your amazing old man hiker) passed the 1,000 mile mark of the AT today over my 3 years on the trail. Staying tonight at a storied ""Bears Den Hostel.""   It is owned by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and operated by a local AT organization. It is a castle looking, stone lodge. A deal for $30 you get: a bunk to sleep in, laundry, pizza, soda, a pint of Ben & Jerrys ice cream, access to the hiker room with TV, shower and a self serve pancake breakfast. Glad my buddy Paul Bunion strongly suggested it.Seeing a little more fall colors - still not that much. Another beautiful day; although the temps were a little too high for working so hard today.

Still several rocky areas but without the constant ups and downs.""At 20 after 10, I came to West Virginia."" A personal joke that only Wendy will get. Today's pic shows that I crossed the state line from VA to WV. However, I am not done with VA yet. The AT crosses back and forth between the two states for awhile. As a matter of fact I'm not sure where I lay my head down to rest.All is well in whichever state I'm in. Will get to Harpers Ferry, WV tomorrow.

Currently in Harpers Ferry, WV and it's in the mid 80's. My Fall hike is suppose to be fall; I intentionally didn't sign up for a summer hike.Did 8.7 miles today to reach town. It would have been about 6 more miles in the heat to a shelter or camp spot. And I have town chores to do, so found TeaHorse Hostel(nicely air conditioned) and moved in. Forecast is for another mid80 day tomorrow, followed by one day in the 70's and then back where it should be in the 60's.Visited the ATC HQ and picked up an envelope from Wendy with my absentee voting ballot. (ATC is the Appalachian Trail conservancy- National headquarters). Also got my picture taken for their book of prospective 2,000 mile hikers.FINALLY done with Virginia!!!! Think I mentioned before that I first hiked into that long, long state in May, 2014. Went over the 200 mile mark of this hike today. My plan to reach my boyhood home in NJ is a 540 mile goal for the Fall. So, I'm 37% done after 22 days on the trail.

Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550812,"3 year AT mileage = 1029.4Fall hike mileage. = 208.5Today was the least pleasant of this Fall's hike. The forecast was for temps reaching the mid 80's.   Especially on such days I like to get an early start. But today I had to resupply at the Harpers Ferry Outfitters. It does not open until 10am and it turned out the owner did not arrive until 10:15. Turns out I didn't make it out of town until 10:40. The first 3.5 miles was a snap, along a flat old horse pull path that was used to pull barges. Then the real fun began going up a long incline in warming, high humidity conditions. I really struggled with the climb and then several miles to the shelter. Sweating so much I had to rehydrate often and consumed all my water. Finally reached the shelter about 3pm, totally exhausted and very dry. The shelters water source was .4 mile down a steep path. Could not handle it right away and just laid down and rested for about an hour. I had to have water for the night meal and to start off tomorrow morning. Took nearly an hour round trip to bring back 2.75 liters of the precious gold(2 in bottles & .75 in my stomach.). After eating and a few more chores I hit the sack. On the fun side today, I met a woman waiting at the AT. Turns out she is from Myrtle Beach, SC. Her daughter was to arrive within minutes completing her 2016 flip flop thru hike. I started up the trail and soon saw her. Yelled out congratulations.That's all for now, hopefully better days ahead.ofPS: today's pic is from Harpers Ferry where the ATC HQ's is housed. Apparently some town folks care more about dogs putting a bowl out on there sidewalk.PSS: Also forgot to mention that I left WV this morning and am now in Maryland.","Teahorse Hostel, Harpers Ferry, WV

Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550819,"3 year AT mileage = 1040.6Fall hike total = 219.8Very short hiking day today, at least for official AT miles of only 0.3 miles.Had an absolutely horrible night. Over the last few days my urination had been tapering down and after about 4pm I could not go at all. Continued to have strong urges; but, could not go at all. In and out of the tent for hours as each urge hit. The camping area had a building with toilets and I actually sat in there for hours on a toilet since it was more comfortable. Bottom line is that I did not sleep at all, not one wink. So during the night my plan developed to hike to the next road crossing and get into town. From there it was 2.5 miles into Boonsboro, MD. Tried hitch-hiking for about 30 minutes with no success, ended up walking into Boonsboro. Fortunately it was almost all down hill. Once in town I called my Urologist and they sent a prescription to a pharmacy there. Too bad it was an additional 1.5 miles to it. So off I go again. Then suddenly a vehicle pulls over and asks if I want a ride - sure did. An off duty law enforcement man named Rusty drove me to the pharmacy, waited while a mix-up in which branch the prescription was sent to and then offered to drive me about 15 miles to Hagerstown and a motel. Talk about great trail magic!!!Checked in the motel about 11am and started the antibiotic. Laid in bed for hours under covers with chills, except for the occasional urges and hoped for urination to begin. About 4pm I thought it would be prudent to seek medical help. Got the hotel manager to drive me to a nearby hospital emergency room. Was there for about 4 hours. Besides all the normal blood tests and such, they inserted a catheter and drained my bladder which contained blood. Got 2 bags of saline solution and antibiotics via IV. Ultimately they said they would release me, if I would leave the catheter in(with collection bag) and go to my Urologist as soon as I got home. I agreed and they had a cab take me back to the motel.One exciting day!!!","Dahlgren Camping Area - Maryland

Local office does not open until 9am. So, I breakfast at motel and get ready to leave, not knowing if I'm strong enough to make it all way in one day. By the time I actually get on the road it is 10am. About 11:30 I am getting to drowsy and pull into a rest area. End up taking a 40 minute nap in the car. Feel better driving after that. While at a stop for lunch, I get a call from the MD hospital telling me they got preliminary blood culture results indicating bacteria in my blood stream. They strongly suggest getting to the ER as soon as I get home. I continue driving towards home and go directly to the Aiken Regional Medical Center's ER arriving about 8pm. Of course they do various blood tests and also get faxed results from the MD hospital. They strongly suggest I agree to be admitted to begin a series of targeted antibiotics. At 2am I get into a room. Initial estimate is at least a few days here.So, obviously I am off the AT. So unfortunate since I was doing well and enjoying this Falls' hike. Oh well.

Being led to believe I'll be here in the hospital until 10/26.   Wendy(wife) and son Andrew visited today. Good to see them and get caught up a little after being gone almost a month. They also took the rental car and turned it in for me.Concerning the hike, I feel good about what I did. Had long wanted to hike through the Shenandoah National Park, it was nice hiking with some very impressive vista's. The only disappointment there was missing the fall foliage season, even though I planned for it in normal years to occur when I was there.Physically I felt strong as opposed to several other of my hikes.And of course the people met on the trail are always fun. That includes AT thru-hikers, section hikers, day hikers and trail angels of all sorts.And lastly, to my wife Wendy who has helped out in supporting me in many ways.
