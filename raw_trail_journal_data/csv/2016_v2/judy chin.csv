judy chin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521402,"Did a test run of my pack and equipment at Torreya State Park. Hiked in to primitive camping on a bluff, got up the next morning and hiked 12 miles. It took two hours to pack everything up and get going -- although it was somewhat relaxed with coffee and a fire. Had a lot of fun.",,Preparation,"Feb 06, Fri",0

judy chin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521455,"It took a long time to get over the emotional and physical absence of running.
After my knee surgery in 2006 and the doc told me to take a cart to golf (I thought he was nuts), sitting on the chair in my bedroom was when I ""decided"" I would thru hike -- it was a deciding moment. I sat in that chair with this blue, big ass knee brace and thought this physician is crazy stupid. I proved him wrong!!!!!! 
I since have done an ascent on Mt. Ranier, a few Olympic triathlons, a few halfs, an Ironman. 
All my endeavors have been with EGz/friends - celebrating each achievement with a sense of solidarity.    
This next adventure is striving for independence -- but I don't think that's the right word. It's just looking to see if I can achieve something on my own. 
This whole journey means quite a bit to me. Gosh, I wonder what the outcome will be?","preparation

judy chin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522969,Gooch Mt Shelter -- Night: a baby owl and momma owl smack dab above my tent. Camp fires. Stars and more stars. Getting lost in the dark from the privy. Wiggling my toes in my down sleep socks.   DAY: Warm and beautiful views and reminding myself this is way way way better than work!   The old night and day: Day was work; night was sleep.,"Hawk Mountain Shelter

judy chin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523112,"I could not camp between Jarred Gap and Neel Gap due to bear danger -- required a bear canister something similar to a bucket with a screw top. Most hikers stopped at Lance Creek and the scene was similar to a music festival or a tent city after a natural disaster. I know it will thin out, but it was fun and I enjoyed the commaraderie. There are more males than females at this point. I would say it's about average between college grads and above 50 year olds.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

judy chin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523115,"I packed up my stuff the fastest yet. The system is being established!
I leap-frogged with fellow campers and hikers to the top of Blood Mountain. It was a beautiful mystical day with lots of fog. Not much of a few on top of Blood Mt., but I enjoyed the black-and-white hike. 
Ended in Neel Gap. Showered, laundered and replenished. I'm carrying too much food and cannot believe I bought more. People are giving their provisions away on the trail......
I miss Bunczka. 
Good luck to Annemarie tomorrow with her job interview! You got it!!!","Lance Creek Camp
